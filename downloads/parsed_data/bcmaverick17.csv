"event","Unorganized or overwhelmed...not sure which it is.  It's probably a little bit of both I suspect.  I can't seem to stay on top of things and every instructor thinks their stuff is more important for you to memorize.  Our ""college"" policy is that you are suppose to address the instructors as ""professor"".....heh, I don't think so.  The only thing that makes them an instructor period is the fact that they have an RN license.  That doesn't necessarily qualify them to be good classroom teachers.  I'm going to stick it through to the end with this school till I at least receive my LPN, but there is no way in hell I'm sticking around there for my RN.  I definitely feel as if I'm treading water and getting more and more exhausted as times goes by.

I got my car back today from the shop.  Thankfully it was only $236 to fix the transmission panel and not having to buy an entire transmission for a few thousand.  It also gave me an excuse to ask some girl for a ride to and from clinical.  In a way I wish my car would have been out of commission for at least another day hehe.

I don't understand my clinical instructor.  One day she praises me for all my work and the next she rides my ass hard on the slightest details.  I vented a bit about it with a few classmates and they just kind of laughed and said something to the effect of ""you know she likes you right?""  I guess I just don't see it.  Is she happy with what I do?  Is she just trying to challenge me to become better?  Or is it some kind of random mood swing?  I'm only human and can't be perfect all the time.  I was pretty content with my work and I guess I do have a problem with my work being challenged when I'm happy with it.  Oh well, only two more weeks of clinical left and then finals to follow.

I seem to be having a hard time keeping my thoughts in check.  It feels like a tornado in my head lately and I can't concentrate to save my life.  I used to think I had learned to keep my emotions under control but I'm catching myself slipping here and there.  A part of me wishes I had none, but then I wouldn't be human.  Why am I more concerned with finding an opportunity to talk to her versus getting my care plans and other documentation finished?  Why does her number on my cell feel like cash burning a hole in my pocket?  If only I could cover my thoughts with some kind of iron curtain so I could focus on my schooling everything would be just fine.  If such a thing were possible, why is it I know I would try to sabotage it...seriously, what the hell?

I watched the first episode of Castle on ABC finally.  I'm definitely a Nathan Fillion fan....Capt Malcolm Reynolds is the man.  It really wasn't anything too special as far as murder mysteries go, but NF cracks me up.  I'm still hoping for a Serenity or Dr. Horrible sequel.  I don't see the show surviving more than two seasons max but I'll try to keep up with it."

"event","Got to play with needles again in lab today.  I'm supposed to be ready for my skills checkoff next tuesday on SQ, IM, ID shots.  I think i managed 1/20 successful attempts of a fake TB shot and only practiced a single IM shot on a dummy.  All I can do now is read up on the procedures as much as possible and I guess I can practice more TB shots using this fleshy-doey-gizmo and my insulin syringes.  The needles are different but I figure as long as I'm using the right angle and such it shouldn't make too much difference.  I don't think the gauges are that much different.  Better than nothing I guess.

I'm pretty sure my cell phone is no longer being stalked.  I'm definitely no longer a fan of phone trees in clinical groups.  If clinical gets cancelled emails would work much better.  At least then I can let them all go to my spam folder.  I just find it unsettling when a random person feels its ok to get my number behind my back, txt me nonstop in a somewhat pushy manner about her supposed interest in me, refuses to reveal herself, and thinks I'm too stupid to figure out how they could have possibly gotten the number in the first place.  Even if the girl was one I'd have been somewhat attracted to that still would not have made a very good impression.  I don't understand why I don't feel flattered at all.  I feel...pissed off.

"event","A few months ago I was pretty psyched about my life getting back on track.  I was working with people who had all the faith in the world in me.  I had finally worked up the courage to go back to school.  I was feeling good about myself too and was beginning to build up confidence again.  I thought I was ready.

Now I'm not just not feeling it.  The more I strive to find my way in life the more confused I'm becoming.  I would probably describe my path as being a dirt trail in the woods surrounded by mist.  There are times that I can kind of see where I'm going but then there are others where I can only see just a few feet in front of me.  I can't make out my surroundings at all; I only know this a road that leads somewhere and its better than wandering off the trail and being completely engulfed in the mist. 

We're going to be learning how to give injections the next few weeks.  So far clinicals haven't been too terribly tough.  My partner was a no-call, no-show last week so I'm now a one-man team.  I have nobody to bounce my ideas off or to keep me company.  I feel like an outsider both at my clinical site and in my own clinical group.  My instructor loses her calm and gives in to her own madness, frustated with the dump we're stuck at for the next couple of weeks.  I just want to learn as much as I can, maintain my sanity, pass, and move on.

I'm not too sure how I did on the dosage calculations exam.  I have to pass with a 90 or above.  That leaves me two mistakes and I know for sure I already missed one question.  Math has never been my strong suit and seems to be the only subject where I feel stressed during exams.  

It turns out that most of the people I've been hanging around are way younger than me.  I turn 25 in a few months and that already feels old....a quarter of a century old.  These kids are only 19!  We were talking about it today and it breaks down to them being seventh graders while I was graduating high school...when I was in shape and headed for Annapolis...when I got sent home due to my POS pancreas.  

Having a crush is a pain in the ass too.  Why can't I just phase out any feelings that I have for anybody?  I feel like those kind of thoughts muddle any kind of rationality my brain is capable of making.  I'm terrified that people will see that I like her.  I tried asking her out but I'm not even sure she processed it as a sorry attempt in the slightest.  Dating somebody in the same class is a lot like pissing in your own water hole...you just shouldn't do it and things can get nasty.  I'm not even sure why I'm even thinking of it in terms of as a possibility.  She's a lot younger than me and is looking for somebody more fun.  My sorry ass goes to school, sleeps, and works.  My network of friends is very small, even smaller than it was in high school.  I feel like I'd have nothing to offer and that there is no way I could keep up.  I've been trying to learn not to care what others think of me, but what she thinks of me matters a lot and I don't know why.

A part of me is tired of this nursing stuff already but I'm all out of options at this point.  I need to just keep heading the same direction I've been going and follow through with this no matter what.  At this point I don't care where I go as long as its out of the misty forest."

Midterms are next week and it hasn't really hit me yet.  Usually about this time I would be spazzing out about how much I need to study and how little time there is to do it all in.  The thing is, I'm pretty indifferent to it all right now.  I wouldn't say I'm overconfident, it's just that I know that somehow I'm going to get by and everything will be alright.  I don't even care if I can rememember every little detail discussed in class because like the professors said, there is just too much information out there for one person to know.  I can't help but think about what life could be like after graduation and when I'm actually out there in the field.  I'd like to pretend that after I'm done with this thing everything will fall into place and all is going to be alright for once.

I had a pretty good time at the Super Bowl party.  I didn't really know anybody there but there was plenty of food, jelloshots, and a big screen tv in almost every room.  My bro-in-law's best friend was going to try to set me up with his cousin but she didn't show.  It turns out that she's already found somebody else.  It's all good though.  I've gotten the hang of not keeping my hopes up for that sort of thing.  The commercials were terrible by the way...

I've grown to accept who I am and I'm comfortable with who I am... but I still don't know who or what I am.  Does that make any sense?"

"event","Getting life back on track is not as easy it sounds.  It is a lot like having dug the biggest hole you possibly could, have jumped down inside it, and then somehow expect to find a way to climb to climb out.  I've found that once you've reached Step 3 you are pretty much stuck there until somebody throws you a rope.  Thankfully, my dad threw me that rope that is giving me a second chance at life.

With my dad's new job, I now have health insurance through the end of this year.  This will allow me to drop my hours down to part-time so that I can attend a full-time LPN school and work my way up to someday becoming a psychiatric nurse practitioner.  The thought of becoming a PNP feels more like a dream, but the prospect of me becoming a nurse is definitely a reality.  I got accepted into a private nursing school (rather expensive but no waiting list) and will graduate mid-December.  Once I pass my state boards I will be a practical nurse and can get a job practically anywhere.  

I'm not as afraid of the whole ""responsible over tons of patients"" thing anymore.  Two years of being an aide has gotten me over that and I have a lot more confidence now while dealing with difficult residents or during crises that arise nightly.  I have faith in my judgment of how to act and am able to think far enough ahead to prepare for anything that could go wrong.  My nurses think very highly of both me as a person and my ability as an aide.  I know I can do this...it's just a matter of following through with this and not failing.

I still have a long way to go as far as climbing out of that hole, but at least now I've got some rope to work with."

"event","So things are not going the way I had hoped they would this year already.  I'd like to think that every year is a new year to start over and make things right, but that just never turns out to be the case.  If anything, I already feel kind of screwed as it is and very unsure of how things are going to play out.

1)  School is going sort of so-so.  I didn't receive a loan approval yet and the lines at school have been too long go speak to financial aid about what is going on, so I've had to pay up front with my credit card.  Just what I needed...more and more bills that I cannot afford to pay.  Sinclair isn't a terrible school and I kind of like the feel to it...maybe just because it is somewhere new.  The uneasiness I feel about being both in a new school and just downtown Dayton in general will be good for me in the long run.  I need to stop being so scared of the real world and throw myself out there in a sense.  My profs seem to be ok, although the Indian lady I have for anatomy&physio goes way too damn fast and I have no time to write everything down in my notes.  I need to come up with some sort of system for her, but I'm sure in the end I'll be alright.

The whole downer is that I'm taking UNDERGRADUATE courses STILL...and not just that, but at a TWO-YEAR COLLEGE!  I still stand behind my decision to be going through with this and going for nursing, but I just feel like I'm so behind everyone else in terms of moving on with their lives.  I should be out on my own with my own apartment and stuff, working at some job, and doing whatever the hell I want.  Instead I have unstable living conditions, no decent job because nobody will hire me (until state testing), and I have no money.  It's so hard to live with all this.  Everyday I find myself having to take deep breaths, calm down, and move with the flow...all in hopes of everything working out until atleast the next day comes around.  It sucks.

2)  One of my best friends since 5th grade has decided to move to Texas.  Mike applied for that job helping test out the new Bleach CCG down in Texas and had been waiting for an offer from them.  They had even flown him down for a second interview.  This last week they called him back and offered him a job...but for shit pay and he STILL took it!  There is no fucking way I'd pack my bags and move to Texas for a $10/hr JOB!
Yet he's decided to do just that and I have no idea how he's going to make it down there.  It is his life though and he can do whatever he wants with it as long as he's willing to accept the consequences.  As a friend, I tried to show him how tight money would be if he did this without telling him what to do, so I feel as if I've done all that I can.  Who knows, maybe he'll surprise us all and really make it down there afterall.

3)  I went to my friend Eric's graduation party today.  He finished up with a BS in exercise biology from Miami U right around the same time I graduated.  He's now working at Children's Med Center (since his family knew people to get him in there) and is waiting on grad schools to get back to him about dental school.  He's hoping to go to OSU.  He also got a new girlfriend now(wasn't there at the party because she lives an hour away)and from the looks of her picture he did quite well.  Mike and I were the only friends there and it was mostly family....however, it was pretty cool to see how much family support her had behind him on the whole graduation thing and how they actually gave a damn about him.  I found myself to be both happy for him and jealous at the same time.

My family could give a damn about how I'm doing.  I didn't get a graduation party and only two people even acknowledged that I graduated...my aunt and gma.  I didn't have the privilege to go to school fulltime and never have to work while mommy and daddy paid for everything because my parents are in their own little worlds.  Hell, even if I had a party, I wouldn't have many friends to come to the damn thing anyways.  It's just so hard to keep focus on what I need to do because I can't stand how everybody else has it so damn easy.  I know that in the end I can make things work, but I'm having to go a roundabout way to get them done and although it makes perfect sense to me, I wonder if I'm really not just dreaming.

SO in a nutshell, things are just starting to bother me again.  My plan of living off of savings for a month or so while I got my nurse assistant training done isn't working too hot because I didn't expect to be told I had to wait an entire month for state testing in order to be eligible for employment.  My best friend is moving far away...leaving me with only 2 other people I sometimes hang out with:  1 who comes every 2 weeks from Cincy that will soon be going elsewhere to grad school too, and another who spends all his free time w/his girlfriend for obvious reasons.  In essence, because of the introvert I am and the few close friends whom I have made....I've fucked myself over.  Soon I'll have nobody to interact with  on at least a weekly basis and it is so damn hard to find friends once you are out of high school.  This just really blows."

"event","It is has been sooo long since I've updated this journal.  For the most part, things have been going fairly well and life has been ""satisfactory.""  After rejoining my guild in the world of warcraft, I finally feel like I can somewhat socialize (even if its not real life) with people who are like me and share common interests.  Even after having been gone from the game for 6+ months, I've already been given back my guild officer status and the other officers and guildmaster respect my opinion in different matters.  I guess what I like most about it is that I finally feel somewhat needed again.  That isn't to say that there have been problems though.

1)  Angst, another guild that we are ""allied with"" totally screwed us over on Saturday.  We had an arrangement with them to work together in taking on Molten Core (one of the top raid dungeons in WoW) and for some reason decided to ignore invites to the raid party to most of our people.  They didn't even bother consulting the raid sign-up sheet as well.  They invited whoever they felt like from their guild only, ignored most of us who had helped them from the beginning, and pretty much drove our guildmaster insane.  I realize it is all politics, but god damn, for as long as I can remember....our guild always gets screwed over in these arrangements because we try to play nice.  Oh well.

2)  The expansion pack comes out in a few months and they are revamping a lot of the different aspects of the game.  For starters, reputuation with different factions (higher reputation allows you to purchase different items and stuff) will be reset.  Just to give you an idea, it takes months to get decent reputation so this will really piss off a lot of people.  Since the max level per character will be raised from 60 to 70, a lot of the good gear that we strive for (such as molten core) will become obsolete and everyone will have to play catchup.  The idea of leveling all my characters up that far again makes me feel anxious and stressed out.

Venture Brothers has finally come to a close and their 2-part season finale was just amazing.  I will be at Best Buy the day it comes out on DVD to pick that sucker up asap!  

Women confuse me so damn much.  I honestly am questioning my decision to cut off contact with Beth again.  If there was no history between us and I had no feelings for her at all, she would be a pretty awesome friend to have.  The fact that I still have feelings for, even if they are slight, makes it all so hard for me to handle...especially now that she has her new beau.  In one way, I am very happy for her and it is nice to know she is no longer the troubled girl I used to know that made my life miserable when she went crazy.  On the other hand, I feel bottled-up rage because I feel like I was abused emotionally throughout the entire relationship...having to deal with all of her anger that she let out on me when in fact she was angry with her own life in general.  It just isn't fair.  I had to pull an arm and a leg to ever get her to see me whereas now she makes time to see him.  She was so damn defensive and hard to get to open up to me....I wish I hadn't wasted so much time and effort giving her multiple chances to stick with her.  I feel like I both love her and hate her at the same time.  Even if she does somewhat care about me, I think it is best to let her go and never talk to her again.  There is just too much pain that I have yet to get over.  I've been treated like shit by every girl I've ever had the slighest relationship with and she was the icing on the cake.  My sister wonders if I'm gay because I have no significant other.  Even though no woman would be interested in me in the first place, I'd like to think that part of this is a life choice for now.  No girl = less stress, less drama, and more free time to do whatever the fuck I want and be myself.  Women want to have power over the man and be treated special....well damn it, they should friggin treat their man just as they wish to be treated too!  There is no way in hell I'm allowing some bitch to walk over me like that again and expect me to accept it.  Honestly, fuck that!  No relationship is better than a shitty one.  Ok, so maybe I do have some issues here...lol.  Sorry about the venting.  It is healthy for the soul I say :)

The instance was really sweet looking, but wow, the place takes forever to beat.  At a good pace, it should take a group of 40 in a raid about 6 hours to defeat all the bosses.  It is seriously the hardest place I've ever been to in the world of warcraft (the furthest I had been was the 2nd boss after 3 weeks with a different group I went with, lol).  Somehow, we managed to get to the final boss in a mere 5 hours!  We didn't beat him, but damn it was a nice run.  My druid kicks ass for a raid, but I think I might work on my hunter for pvp/farming purposes.  

After my secondary insurance kicked in, I still owe around $600.00 for my little mishap in Texas.  Not too sure how I'm going to pay that yet.  You'd think insurance would cover everything, but no, mine doesn't :(

A lot of my favorite shows are at a close.  Venture Bros still has one or two episodes left, but my animes are ending!  I watched the last episode of Blood+...going to miss watching Saya kick ass.  I have the rest of Demonbane and Coyote Ragtime Show downloaded..just need to get around to watching them.  I'm also about two weeks behind on Avatar, but I'll get around to that as well.

I'm not making enough money to pay my mom's rent, buy my own food, cat bills, and have a life.  To be honest, I can't remember the last time I went out and bought a game, movie, whatever.  The fact of the matter is that I'm spending more than I make and my credit card is slowly starting to attain a high balance.  I suppose I could work more hours but then it would really hit my schooling hard.  All I can hope for is that by the time Christmas comes I can start working full-time to catch up.  Ha, what am I kidding myself...Christmas means SPENDING EVEN MORE MONEY on friggin presents for everybody.  LOL I have no clue how I'm going to make it...really don't want to have to dip into savings again.

I finally came up with a name for my warhammer army.  Besides a stupid technical title like <b><i>17th Cadian Artillery Regiment</b></i> most armies have a nickname, so I chose <b><i>Chevaliers</i></b>.  I really like the sound of it, and historically a chevalier was a low ranking noble in French aristocracy.  Second, chevaliers are mentioned in three animes I watch....<b>Blood+, Chevalier, and ZnT</b>.  I know the anglicized version is <i>Cavalier</i>...but my team isn't led by King Lebron James...so the hell with that (though if I were into NBA basketball I'd definitely root for Ohio.)  I've already come up with names for my officers and most of my sergeants based off of nicknames and formal names for historical figures.  I realize that most people consider the game to be retarded as it is and that by giving names to my guys that is taking it to an alltime low...but I figure if we're going to roleplay I might as well really get into it!  So yeah.  <b><i>Chevaliers</b></i>.  Dig it."

I just can't help but think that I'm behind in life or something.  Every time I turn around, people are getting married and moving on with their lives...and here I am, stuck at home w/my mother as a landlady that is never there and still haven't graduate yet.  *sigh*  It is so hard to remain positive sometimes.

I had my picture taken at work today for our online JAG biographies.  I hadn't shaved this morning and I'm in desperate need of a haircut....in other words, VERY shitty pic.  You can see just how much weight I've gained in my face and all the scars from pimples past and present.  Honestly, why couldn't they just let me wear a paperbag over my head or something? LOL.

I called the Base Med Center looking for a psychiatric nurse practitioner to interview for my project.  No luck there.  Then I called Kettering Med Center and they have a lady that does practically the same thing but she is considered a clinical nurse specialist.

My Dad was then kind enough to buy me an early graduation present...a kickass 17"" Samsung LCD monitor w/2ms response time!  It seriously is like wow....sorta like that feeling when you get a new pair of glasses and see the world in an entirely different view.  The picture on the thing is friggin sweet.  I can't thank him enough.

Blood+ and ZnT are on their last legs of their respective series runs.  I'm going to miss seeing Saya in action w/her katana fighting all over the world, her chevalier bodyguard Haji, and her bro Kai w/the rest of Red Shield.  I'm equally going to be upset when there is no more Saito w/his badass sword being chased around by big-breasted women and being scolded by his master, Louise the Zero.  Oh well, I'm sure I'll find more interesting animes to keep me entertained.

New Avatar movie was awesome.  So glad to see the warpaint-faced chic again (forgot her name) and now I would totally be an earthbender after seeing Aang in action.  Seriously, I could be like friggin Gaara from Naruto that way.

Dad's 50th b-day party went pretty well.  He was definitely surprised.  My bro and I's card we got him had him all red in the face laughing his ass off, almost falling out of his chair.

I didn't want to buy a computer backpack because most of those don't have a drink holder <i>(a <b>MUST</b>, especially for cars!!)</i>...and the fact I really like the backpack I have.  Soo...I found a sleeve case for it!  Think of a Five-Star brand zipper binder for laptops...but with an optional strap and handles.  The damn thing fits in my backpack perfectly and, if I only need the laptop, I snap on the strap and its a bag too!  Not that I really needed it, I also got a notebook mouse w/retractible cord and a case for my flash drive <i>(the damn cap always pops off and this will put an end to that).</i>  In other words, like one of my favorite quotes from Long John Silver's commericals, <i>""Yarr...Genious!""</i>

Because of how damn curious I am, I decided to see if there was any kind of ""practitioner-focused"" doctorate for nursing available, sorta like how psychologists have the PsyD. versus getting the research-focused PhD.  I am not into research at all, but I'd like to specialize in something and possibly become clinical faculty at some school.  And yes...there is such a thing for nursing:  The DNP degree! (Doctor of Nursing Practice)  It is sort of a new thing, like the first program for it didn't start until 1999.  So far, only 4 schools in the nation offer this and more are slowly developing curriculums to add this to their program as well.  Case Western happens to be one, so perhaps someday when I'm all 30ish and a nurse practitioner, that is where I'd go.  I realize that is sooo far away but I can't help not thinking ahead.  

Avatar movie tomorrow.  Can't wait for that to hit the net so I can watch it (I'm bound to miss the premiere tomorrow due to friends coming over).  Uncle Iroh rocks!!!...and so does Tea :)"

"event","I'm not too big a fan of my old LJ s/n.  I'm not even sure what I was thinking when I took it either.  I know that ""Jaden"" is my favorite name, even though it isn't my own, and that I'd probably name a kid that someday if I ever got the chance.  The ""sama"" part is just dumb.  I'm not even too sure what the hell I would change it to.  I guess I could go with my AIM s/n that I've kept since junior year of HS:  BCMaverick17.  It's also a silly name, but less retarded than the one I used to hold.  In breaking it down, it does have a lot of meaning for me.  The ""BC"" is for ""Beavercreek Celtics,"" my club soccer team.  The two seasons I played for them were some of the best moments of my life.  I found teammates that accepted me, a coach that believed in me, and I found out a lot about myself and what I was capable of doing.  I felt like I did my part on the team as well, scoring my fair share of goals while playing right wing and saving my fair share of shots as the goalkeeper.  I had also worked out a lot at the gym and was in great physical shape.  I could blow through guys, take a hit, and run forever it seemed like.  I was even able to bench more than my body weight!  After watching stuff like Naruto, Bleach, other animes w/fictional characters w/extraodinary strength, I think that while I was on that team that was probably the closest I've ever come to achieving that feeling of both power and peace. 

The ""Maverick"" part was from Top Gun, my favorite movie during the time I was prepping up for the Naval Academy and before Tom Cruise came out of the closet.  I liked the character of Maverick not because he was Tom Cruise, or a damn good fighter pilot...it was because of how he movie stressed his potential to become great.  Many people in my life have told me about how much potential I have and how the sky is the limit and whatnot...I was never awesome at anything, but I others always saw potential in me to become something better than ordinary.  

As for the ""17""...it's my lucky number.  I turned 17 when I got the AIM s/n.  17 was my number in soccer on the Celtics.  I was born on the 17th.  My first best friend was born on the 17th.  My first kiss came from a girl who was also born on the 17th.  It's just a badass number and I like it.  So yeah, I may switch my LJ name soon to reflect that.

Schoolwise, it is going well.  I ran late to class today because of parking issues...so many damn people attend WSU in the fall, but then many drop out and parking goes back to normal in the Winter.  I really enjoyed Doc Herman's lecture today on his definition of ""dharma.""  To him, dharma is knowing who you are and where you stand on things.  I'm still trying to figure this stuff out about myself, and it is an enjoyable experience in doing so.

So yeah, enough crap...I'll leave it at that."

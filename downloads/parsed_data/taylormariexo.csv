"event","i always seem to find a way to screw things up

i say the wrong things at the wrong time
i did things that shouldnt have happened

everything in the past is all one huge regret that makes me wanna kill myself
over and over again because its such a mistake and i cant take it back

i manage to hurt my own feelings just thinking about the past

and i manage to make people upset with me so freaking easily


things i hate_

the past
my emo self lately
how insecure i can be
how upset i get over other people
how worried i am about getting hurt
how fast i assume things
how easily i get sick to my stomach....by just thinking
i lost my bestest friend that was a girl (adt..)
i wont see you on xmas day.


things i love_

estone 



wow. nine things i hate and i can only think of one thing i love
off the top of my head.. maybe because all of my love goes to him 
and im thankful for that because he is what keeps me going



i love you estone owen. so glad i have you again. cant live without you..."

Yes, I pray that you do love me too
All my life I've prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I've prayed for someone like you
Yes, I pray that you do love me too"

"event","i guess the most that i can do
is make a call and tell you the truth
sing the words in melody
and hope that you'll believe me
here's another song for you
so this one this one makes two
i still don't know where to begin
i'll just leave it at this

i'm sure you always feel my eyes on you
but i hope that you will never feel unwanted

wait for me to move out west
it's ok if you don't
i hope you know
you're my favorite thing
about the west coast
i wish i stayed
i hope you wait
so here i am
counting down the days
till california comes

this is the least that i can do
you know i'm bad at calling you
the best way i can extend
the lonely words i miss you
i'll say it but i'm sure you knew
you're what i look most forward to
coming back to where i've been
i'll just leave it at this

i'm sure you always feel my eyes on you
but i hope that you will never feel unwanted
if you feel unwanted

wait for me to move out west
it's ok if you don't
i hope you know
you're my favorite thing
about the west coast
i wish i stayed
i hope you wait
so here i am
counting down the days
till california comes

till california comes

"event","sometimes i feel like i know exactly what i want out of life, like all my dreams and goals are sitting right infront of me within arms reach. other times im confused as can be. i need to stop worrying so much about the future because in all honesty its not guaranteed, all that i have for sure is the here and now and thats what i need to enjoy the most. the future will come in its own time.
with a new year approaching i look back on 2007 and reflect on all the craziness that happened this year. i feel like a year is such a short time but it can change a person so much. i am not the same girl i started out to be in the begining of 07'. and i dont say that with regret, i say it with confidence. i am happy where i am in my life right now, sure i may not know what i want, but im happy with what i have.
i dont feel like alot of people can say they are happy with themselves, i know about 40% of the time i cant. but for the most part i am, i am happy with my friends, my job, and my schooling. its just sometimes i cant help but feel like im missing out on something bigger and better that im suppose to be off doing somewhere.
this is my life and i need to learn to appreciate what i have and never be upset about it. no matter what, your never going to be at the top or at the bottom, there is always going to be someone or something worse or better off than you and i need to learn to deal with that. i need to change the few things in my life that dont make me happy.
i feel blessed with the life i have been given and i need to start showing it.
i want to go into 2008 with a bang. i finally feel like i am where i need to be. i am on my own and glad."

"event","Sometimes i feel like im missing out on youth...just wasting it away with work and school. i feel like since i havent gone away for school yet im just kinda wasting time here....not having the fun i should be.

i really do enjoy life right now. i am in a good place. which i feel like i deserve to be because the last few months have really sucked for me but i finally feel like im getting my mind back on track.

ive been really trying to wake up every day and just be happy that im alive and healthy. i really feel like im getting better at accepting the way my life is and being happy with it. everyone is going through their lives trying to impress everyone else and make sure their liked by everyone and even if you rebel and say your not you truly know you are....but the truth is we should all just accept that we care what other people think about us and move on from that point. 

everyone is so different but at the same time were all the same people going through the same struggles of life....just trying to get from one day to the next.

i feel like everyone exagerates life also.....its alot easier to solve drama in your own life if you just take a second to look at it how someone else might look at it.

life brings you down alot but 99.9% of the time it will help bring you back up."

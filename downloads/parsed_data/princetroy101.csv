"event","Well, I was glancing over my last journal entry and noticed something horrendous -- I posted the wrong date *cringes*. Well, being the obsessive compulsive person I am I figured I'd point that out. Now I must wash my hands 10 times to rid myself of this horrible mistake. Anywho, while we're talking about May, my birthday is May 3rd. I wanna go see a play at either Centerstage, which will be showing Speed the Plow or the Lyric Opera House, which will be showing Carmen. I wanted to go to the Hippodrome, I hear it's really nice there, but on the weekend before my birthday they're showing Dora the Explorer Live -- I don't wanna see that."

"event","Well, today is officially my second day of spring break. I'm not having the time of my life or anything, but it's good to have a break from school. Yesterday and today I had doctors appointments - Mon for othodontics and today for orthopedics.Other than that I've just been home reading Life in Revolutionary France for my World History project. I know, you're saying to yourself ""HOW EXCITING""! Now three more days at home with my step-dad who's on vacation this week -- I'm definetly not looking forward to that."

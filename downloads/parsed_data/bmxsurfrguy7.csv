"event","hey guys...4days a go i was asked to go to occoquan to row in the MV4. the row was pretty shity but atleast we pulled in a fourth place finish. other than that while i was up at occ. i went to FYE and got the story of the year cd...its awesome. oh ya!! i was stoked to find skate and surf stuff in northern virginia, only because while i was at the mall i only saw gothic kids, wiggers, and VERY prepy kids. oh my god! i almost forgot about wut happened at the hotel... RUSSIAN FEAR FACTOR except way more intense. for example... a girl was about to win so they put her in a car to answer the final ""?"" and *joe goes i bet they blow up the car* right before she got a word out the front of the car BLOWS the f**k UP!!! it was so funny, and to add to that then 10 guys come out of left field and beat the hell out of the rest of the car. after that erin called and i talked to her for a while(god i missed you). on the way home from the race we stopped at OLD COUNTRY BUFFET hell yea the food sucked...exuse me SUCKS!! but i hit up the ice cream machine, that kicked ass...for OCB ice cream. well thats about all of my weekend i have to go do yrad work now, so later!"

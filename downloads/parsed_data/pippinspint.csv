"event","Ok, so today was one of crap, crap, crappiest days that I've had in a long time. A bunch of things that just kinda mess with ya will tend to do that. But mostly, the crappiness comes from one incident. Its actually reall simple. 2 years ago I moved from one state to another about 1000 miles away, and stayed in touch with my bestest of best friends. I've known her since I was 11(now 16)and she gets me, I get her, just so much much fun to talk to and hang out with. Anyway, my spring break started today, but hers started last week. I didn't find out about this until yesterday. Since we live so far away, different schools, and everything, vacation time is the time where we talk virtually none stop. But no, theres no response(to an extremely long previous e-mail sent like 5 days ago) until yesterday. Saying""I've been doing a lot of sleeping and cleaning"". 5 days we couldve been talking, but all she was doing was sleeping. I really had thought that maybe she went on vacation, and I could totally get that. Or even busy with her new boyfriend. Nope, she just blew me off for 5 days.......doing absolutely nothing.  I can get wanting to relax on a vacation, but I really didn't think writing me an e-mail was work. :(

Alright, I'm done ranting for now...."

"event","Ok, so I can do very little else but write on here for a while. My high speeds all screwed up right now, so the more writing I get to do. So, I'm gonna try something new. Instead of my past little itty bitty movie notes, I'm gonna try an actual review. In case anyone hasn't gotten it yet, movies are my life. They always will be. But before I write one I'm gonna half to tell you something about myself. In my writing, I will potentially sound snobby. Believe me, I dont do this on purpose. Its kind of a genetic thing, but I was born(yes, born with) an inate sense of superiority. I've always felt that way. Needless to say its not some sort of medical condition, and I've had people tell me that it can be fixed, if I really want to. But they dont seem to understand that I really really like feeling better than everyone else. Lets keep in mind, this isn't the sort of thing where I prance around everyone else laughing at them. Its like a little secret that only I know, that I'm better than everyone else. In my opinion its an ideal way of thinking. If you truly believe that you're better than everyone else, then you can do anything. My entire life, I think that due to the way I think, it really has improved me for the better. Its not like its just one of those thoughts like 'haha, I'm better than everybody else', like a twerpy little kid. It really is a belief set deep inside me. When I say to myself ""your not better than everyone else, your just as good as them, not better"", all that I get back is this little voice saying""your the best and always will be"". It makes me feel good. Let me tell ya, its a huge self esteem booster, and always has been. Anyway, here we go. Please note, I've never done this before, so if sucks, its not my fault. :)

                                               The Jacket
                                             A Movie Review
                                                By L.D.W
                  It's a thriller? A romance? Horror? Sci-fi? Hmmmm, I'm really not sure, maybe a little bit of each. Kinda like it fits into a seperate genre we can just call 'movies'.Yeah, that about sums it up. This film casts its main characters as Adrien Brody(The Pianist) and Keira Knightly(King Arthur, Bend it Like Beckham). They play Jack and Jackie. (Awww, isn't that cute?lol)Jack is a soldier during the Gulf War. Fully active, fighting, guns, and everything. He gets shot it the head, and miraculously survives. Needless to say, they send him home. Not long after he gets back, through a series of really, really bad timing, he gets framed for the murder of a police officer. He can't remember any of it. But thanks to his head wound, all keep saying he's mentally ill, so he's sent to an asylum, in hopes of 'fixing' him. Once there, he uncovers experimental, inhumane treatments on the patients. But, of course, since he's a patient there, no one believes him. This movie takes him through his time there, and let me tell ya, this movie is truly fantastic. 
                 Any other film critic will say, it was good, but not like astounding or anything. This is where I'm gonna have to completely disagree with them all. This movie, when you combine the acting(tremendous), cinemotography(wow), editing(sweet), and the all around directing(again, sweet), it forms into something that really is perfect. Everything just falls together like all the pieces of a puzzle. It truly is a work of art. Personally, I think most critics didn't go for it since its not a run-of-the-mill standard movie. Its very different, this is not a movie for a close minded person. People just get so into routine, including critics, that it just blocks off anything, usually everything, different. For exp. the movie ""Seabuscuit"" was nominated for best picture a few years back. I saw it, and there really isn't any denying, it is a very nice movie, all full of hope, courage, a not-so-likely hero, old guy with nothing too loose, animal with little or no hope to win, just all the makings for a heart felt movie. There was nothing wrong with this movie in hardly any critics eyes. But it was soooooooo run-of-the-mill, it drove me nuts. Here's out it worked in just a few short words. Nobody believed the horse would ever win. He raced one outstanding race and everyone loved him. After a few races(all winning), he loses one, in a wretched defeat. In the very last race he takes first place in a tremendous victory. Thats how it worked. Thats how everyone thought it would work. Very boring. 
                   Meanwhile, back to the Jacket. I can almost promise, that any person who goes to see this movie will like it, maybe love it, but only on the following conditions. 1.Do not make any assumptions about the end, usually when you do this, if your wrong, it'll only make you angry at the movie. 2. Open your mind from the usual, as I said before, this a very different film. 3. Most easily, just relax and let your mind take a trip with the movie. 

(This review went kind-of off topic, but it was my first, so please enjoy.)"

"event","Ok, I've seen oodles of movies this weekend and let me tell ya, that's how I like it. A couple are kinda old, so no newbies. I watched total, in this past week, I think 7 movies. They go as follows..

1.The Jacket(previously discussed)
2.Harold and Kumar go to White Castle
3.Control
4.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
5.The Pianist
6.Gangs of New York
7.Ringuu(Original Japenese version of ""The Ring"")

Now, my ratings are as follows. Just to let you know, I rate on my own personal liking. It has nothing to do with how 'good' the movies are. Except, trust me on this one, I KNOW movies.

The Jacket-4.5 out of 5
Harold and Kumar go to White Castle-3.5 out of 5
Control-3 out of 5
One flew over the Cuckoos Nest-4 out of 5
The Pianist-4 out of 5
Gangs of New York-4 out of 5
Runguu-2.5 out of 5


Now as I said, I believe that The Jacket was fantastic. It just all made sense just like it should have, they managed to throw in a love story that didn't smoosh with any of the other plots. Uh, it was just perfect(look at me, I'm getting all misty eyed,<sniff>). Now Harold and Kumar, lol. Usually, when a comedic movie is made, they cant throw in enough jokes and the plots way to thick, or way too many jokes and everything just flattened together. But this one has lots of pot smoking, lots of really stoned people, and its just funny. Its completely stupid, but it really is a riot.  Now Control is an independant film starring Wilem Dafoe(look him up if ya dont know) and Ray Liotta(again, look him up). Wilem plays a doctor working on an experimental drug meant to calm and relax socio paths, so's to supress their homicidal tendencies. Follow me? Good. Ray Liotta is his experimental subject. And, surprise, it works. He starts behaving normally, and its just all good. But then there's this twist, and it just all goes splat. I really dont like the ending of this movie. Its just kinda stops. I'll give you some advice though, if ya dont like the ending to a movie, dont watch it. I cant tell you how many movies I love the first like hour of, and I hate the ending.For example, Moulin Rouge, HATE THE ENDING! So, I watch all the pretty stuff in the first hour or so, and it gets shut off. So I just dont watch it, its really that simple. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Hmmm, old movie from 1975. It won all five of the major categories at the oscars. Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting actor, and Best Supporting actress. It really is a good movie, kinda sad though, so prepare yourself to be all sad. :( It really, really is a good movie though. The Pianist, again with the Hmmmmm, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe 2002. The movie The Jacket inspired me to go and see the Pianist since Adrien won like tons of awards for acting in it. (He was kinda cool in The Jacket too). He was really good in it(like everyone said). And its just an all around good movie. The Gangs of New York. I think from the same year as the Pianist, not entirely sure though. I think a lot of girls just went to see cause its got Leo in it. (Yes, thats right, I'm on first name basis with him, lol) Its a very violent film, but its definately a must see. :) And lastly, we have Runguu. I'm sorry, but the new American version was way cooler. Seriously."

"event","Most people dont tend to think much outside what happens in their own lives. It may sound selfish, but for the better part, it is true. But if your going to do this, that is, go on living your own life as if no one else mattered, then there are some things that must be done. Mainly, if your going to be ignoring the planet, your main focus should be you. Self-improvement is a huge part of what it is that makes humans so special. We can always strive for newer and better things, but above all, the advancing of our minds. The brain is the most crucial part of survival for man, therefore it must be taken care of. Art if one way, and it targets very specific areas of the brain. So, just to make sure that no one's just smooshing away their brain, I give you my occasional poetry corner. All you have to do is read and enjoy, none of that analyzing or anything. Just appreciate the art for what it is. 

                     
                      The Raven
                  By Edgar Allen Poe

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, 
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, 
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, 
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. 
""'Tis some visiter,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door -- 
                                        Only this, and nothing more.""
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, 
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. 
Eagerly I wished the morrow; -- vainly I had tried to borrow 
From my books surcease of sorrow -- sorrow for the lost Lenore -- 
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -- 
                                        Nameless here for evermore.
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain 
Thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; 
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating 
""'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door -- 
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door; -- 
                                        This it is, and nothing more.""
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, 
""Sir,"" said I, ""or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; 
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, 
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, 
That I scarce was sure I heard you "" -- here I opened wide the door; ---- 
                                        Darkness there and nothing more.
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, 
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; 
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token, 
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore!"" 
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!"" -- 
                                        Merely this, and nothing more.
Then into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, 
Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before. 
""Surely,"" said I, ""surely that is something at my window lattice; 
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -- 
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-- 
                                        'Tis the wind and nothing more!""
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, 
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore; 
Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he; 
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -- 
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -- 
                                        Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, 
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, 
""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven, 
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore -- 
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"" 
                                       Quoth the raven ""Nevermore.""
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, 
Though its answer little meaning -- little relevancy bore; 
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being 
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -- 
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, 
                                       With such name as ""Nevermore.""
But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only 
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. 
Nothing further then he uttered -- not a feather then he fluttered -- 
Till I scarcely more than muttered ""Other friends have flown before -- 
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."" 
                                       Quoth the raven ""Nevermore.""
Wondering at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, 
""Doubtless,"" said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store 
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster 
Followed fast and followed faster so when Hope he would adjure -- 
Stern Despair returned, instead of the sweet Hope he dared adjure -- 
                                       That sad answer, ""Never -- nevermore.""
But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, 
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; 
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking 
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -- 
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore 
                                       Meant in croaking ""Nevermore.""
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing 
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; 
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining 
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er, 
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er, 
                                        She shall press, ah, nevermore!
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer 
Swung by Angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. 
""Wretch,"" I cried, ""thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee 
Respite -- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore; 
Let me quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"" 
                                        Quoth the raven ""Nevermore.""
""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil! -- prophet still, if bird or devil! -- 
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, 
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -- 
On this home by Horror haunted -- tell me truly, I implore -- 
Is there -- is there balm in Gilead? -- tell me -- tell me, I implore!"" 
                                        Quoth the raven ""Nevermore.""
""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil -- prophet still, if bird or devil! 
By that Heaven that bends above us -- by that God we both adore -- 
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, 
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore -- 
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."" 
                                        Quoth the raven ""Nevermore.""
""Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend!"" I shrieked, upstarting -- 
""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! 
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! 
Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door! 
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"" 
                                       Quoth the raven ""Nevermore.""
And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting 
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; 
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon that is dreaming, 
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; 
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor 
                                        Shall be lifted -- nevermore!"

"event","Ok, so we tried the whole movie script thing, and that was a definate no. :P Lets just once again restate that there is no way I can write anything for a living. Nope, just not me. Maybe if ya stick me in a room working with a couple of geniuses we could come up with something, but nope, nothin else. So here's out new experiment. I will review my own film(I didn't make them)(obviously), I merely mean that I will write reviews for any and every movie that I see. I promise on no spoilers or anything, so don't worry about that. ;) All of my reviews are obviously my own personal opinion. And I'm sure most will agree that I am far from you average 16 year old in my thinking. So here we go.....

Yesterday(Sunday), I went to go see the movie entitled""The Jacket"" starring Adrien Brody and Keira Knightly. One word from me-Astounding! Wow, that movie was just so, I'm gonna use this word, however daring it may be, but it was perfect. The story of a young man who due to an injury during the Gulf War gets sent home, and in one of those 'wrong place, wrong time' incidents end up being accused of murder. Due to his injury though, he gets pleaded innocent by reason of mental disease so he gets sent to an institution. Theres your plot. Weird happenings going on at this phsyciatric facility with bizarre experimental treatments which(I know this goes way out there, but its true), but through one treatment he glimpses into the future and discovers his own death. Very odd I know, but trust me, its much more fun to watch and unravel for it yourself. This movie is so well put together and thought out it really does make for an incredible watch. I'm not saying its the best movie of all times, but it really is awesome. 
If you were to go right now and look at some different movie reviews though, pertaining to this movie, you would find, for the better portion, most give this film a thumbs down. Here's the funny thing with that though. If read into each and every one of the 'professionals' opinions you would find that not one of them comes right out and says""This movie was bad"". No, they just say""It was weird"". News FLASH! So was The Matrix, 12 Monkeys, so was Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. We all know that weird never ever under any circumstances means 'bad'. No, it usually makes for an interesting watch no matter what. I swear, crtitics can be so cynical, and just not look at the big picture. Take me for instance. I can tell a good movie from a bad. I've been trained to do so pretty much all my life, but the problem with critics is all they look at are the formulas that create a movie. What you need to look at is the entire whole of the jigsaw that makes the movie into a whole, and how well the pieces fit together. Not only does a film's plot have to follow along smoothly, but is has to be visually appealing, and just all around suited for its viewing audiences. ""The Jacket"" for example, I couldn't really tell you the age genre, but if I had to guess I'ld say pretty much anyone over the age of 14(there are a few adultish scenes in it) could enjoy this movie, potentially, but really, this movie is all about taste. You'll either love it to death(thats me), or you'll just be happy your money wasn't a total waste, but you certainly wont go away hating it. Trust me, go and see it. You'll like it, I promise."

"event","For my own sake and for the sakes of any and all who may read this, I will not be writing of my life, me, or anything else pertaining to myself. It may seem odd, but as my greatest passion in life is film, that's what will be written. Anything and everything I write will be ideas of my own for films, or perhaps films I will base upon my favorite books. But either way, these are my own creations. Also, bear in mind, I am a terrible writer, so these will NOT be final works by any means. Please enjoy.

                                 Film Project-#1-Entitled ""Alanna of Trebond""
                                               (Working Title)
                                 Based on the books written by Tamora Pierce

                A purple mountain's majesty gracefully covers the horizon off in the distance enclosing our home and sanctuary of Trebond. The city belongs to no specific time or place in history, but knights dwelled, along with sorcery and witchcraft. Here our story begins....

Out of one the most prominently expensive homes on the street, come running two childen. Both with flaming red hair and wildly green eyes, they look very much the same, except for of course one being a boy(Thomas), and the other being a girl(Alanna).

Alanna-Run, Thomas, Run! Maude will be VERY angry if we're late again!
The lagging boy, who has much difficulty in catching up with his speedy sister replies.

Thomas-Alanna! Even if we ARE late, what could she possibly do to us? We already do the work the command of us, and we never disobey. I hardly think that another tardiness will make any difference.   
Alanna stops dead in her tracks.

Alanna-You're just trying to delay the inevitable now.....you know there's no use in fighting it.
Thomas finally catches up, and the both have a seat in a small patch of grass next to the road.

Thomas-You're probably right. No, wait, I KNOW you're right. I cant believe we're leaving tomorrow. We wont get a chance to see each other until(counting on his fingers)....at the very least, 3 years! Thats just too long. Alanna! I dont want to be a knight!

Alanna-Well do you think I want to go and learn to be the proper 'duke's daughter' either? At the finishing monastary, they'll make me sit still all day, and learn to do all those boring 'womanly' things. Believe me, I would much rather train to be a night.

Thomas-Well, that's never gonna happen. (chuckles), At least my dreams are realistic. At that monastary, I could learn sorcery, and become a mage! Oh, thats what I've always wanted to be!
Alanna shivers. The thought of using her magic had always frightened her. Unfortunately, thats what she and her brother were heading too, for Maude was their magic instuctor.

Alanna- I really dont think its funny...me not being able to become a knight. I mean, what's the difference whether a knight is a man or a woman, as long as they fight for their country!
Thomas is slightly taken aback.

Thomas-Alright, alright, I didn't mean to make you angry. I see your point, but that's just not the way its ever been. And there's no point in talking about it anyway, we're both stuck with it. Father's already signed the papers. Tomorrow, I head to the palace to become a knight, and you go to the monastary to learn those 'proper woman things'.
Alanna's eyes glittered once, then twice. She had an idea, and not a small one either...

Alanna-Thomas, if I mention something, you must promise to keep and open mind....
Thomas stares somewhat bewildered at his twin sister.

Thomas-Alright.....What is it?

Alanna-(Rather abruptly says) Why dont we swap places?!!?

Thomas-What???? Are you insane???

Alanna-No, It would be perfect! I could fix the letters, I've always been good at father's handwriting. Then you could go learn to be a mage, and I could go become a knight!

Thomas- It could work, maybe....but I think there's one very obvious problem....You're a girl, remeber?

Alanna-Well, if I cut my hair, I could pass well enough for a boy.

Thomas-Yeah, for now. But what happens when you get older? What then?

Alanna-Oh, you worry too much. I can deal with it when I have too.

Thomas-VERY comforting Alanna! You're definately gonna have to drop that name aren't you. What are you going to as....Alan?

Alanna-Perfect! You're so smart Thomas!

Thomas-No, I wasn't serious! (after a few moments of thought) Do you really think this could work?

Alanna-I know it can. We'll work out all the details tonight, right after magic practice.
Both children, very excited and tense, finish the run to Maude's house, where they recieves a very, very harsh scold."

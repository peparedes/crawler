"event","it's been a long long time since my last update.
i kind of miss being able to vent in this journal, not gonna lie.
but i honestly have nothing to vent about. in fact, i've been extrememly happy lately, and i love it.
today was super sunny. and super warm. and super super.
so.
i drove around blasting music in yeat town with the windows down, then went for a run around yeat town, and it was amazing.
AND
i had my first day of work at brooksby village. exciting! and nerve-wracking...it's gonna be haavoc.
and now i'm babysitting, so a pretty good saturday haha.
yesterday connor came over and we went to blockbuster and rented The Man and had a movie party. and napped. it was relaxing and i liked it :D
tomororw i'm watching Seven/making movies with tricia jax and mego. should be prettty good!
oh! and i'm getting a prom dress. also very good!


speaking of prom dresses, the fashion show went smoothly this week. all the stress is over, so that is definitely a plus. and everyone looked stunning, so i cant complain.


parent trap is on ABC Family. i love when an old movie you used to watch comes on finally, and you still know all the lines. so great.

okay i really have nothing to say.
talk to you later?


hah! i love how i refer to LJ like it's a person.

<P><STRONG>Ground rules: The first player of this ""game"" writes ""Five Weird Habits of Yourself"" and the people who get tagged need to then write their five quirky little habits as well as state the rules of this game clearly. In the end, you need to list the next five people who you want to tag, and then go on to leave a tag comment on their LJ. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>1.</STRONG> when i eat lucky charms (every day after school), i purposely pour in too much milk, and when i finish my first bowl of cereal, i say ""oh wow look at that. there's still milk in there,"" so i pour some more cereal. and then when i run out of cereal and there's more milk, i pour more cereal and eat it til the milk's gone. it's a little game i play with myself....</P>
<P><STRONG>2.</STRONG> i have an entire draw under my bed filled with song quotes and aim conversations that would take a good year to read through. i think it's safe to say that i am an obsessive compulsive song quote writer.</P>
<P><STRONG>3.</STRONG> if i tap my left foot, i have to tap my right foot as well. i like my left side more because i feel like since i don't use it as much (i'm right handed), it needs more attention. sometimes, i'm lame like that :)</P>
<P><STRONG>4.</STRONG> i talk to myself in my head and laugh at my own jokes. and when i go to say that ""funny"" joke, i laugh before i come close to finishing it, and ruin the joke. and then no one laughs at the joke. and then i fail at being a joker. boo.</P>
<P><STRONG>5</STRONG>. i drive alone in the car and get pleasure out of blasting rap and pretending i'm a gangster. so i try to do the ghetto seat-back with one hand on the stearing wheel driving, rap, &nbsp;and end up&nbsp;looking like&nbsp;a tool instead of a gangster. a-thank you :)</P>

<P>thursday morning i went to the football game and tailgated. freezing as all hell, but it was really fun.&nbsp; then went to my aunt's house for thanksgiving. crazy...as always. my family is nuts. enough said.</P>
<P>friday i went out with tom, tommy k, mego, and meg comp to wendy's. then back to keech's with dean john kane and seth. it was fun. </P>
<P>saturday i went to connor's house. it was excellent :)</P>
<P>and sunday&nbsp;i really don't remember. i went somewhere, but who knows.</P>
<P>so it was pretty much a really good break :)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>hmmm school's school. had a half day wednesday though. me meg and meg ordered from rowley house and baked a cake, so that was coooool. then on thursday i went to the football game in arlington. they lost but it was a good game. i mean it was on turf, how could it not be?! played a wicked funny game on the way there. me cull and jerm's car vs. aussie joe haley and dave. that's it. </P>

<P>now that that made no sense, i guess i'll update. even though it's almost guaranteed no one will comment because well, no one does anymore. good old myspace...</P>
<P>so let's see. thursday night i went to sylvan street with a bunch of people from my grade. <BR>here's the good story: me jax and em went in em's car because o.c. was on and jax needed to be home for piano, so we just took a different car. em's gas light had been on for 5 days, and she'd been driving on E. so we went to getty to fill it up, and it was closed. so me and jax, being the oblivious people that we are, are like ""LET'S BANK IT!!! DUDE WE'LL TOTALLY MAKE IT!!!"" So emma drives and we try to make it to sylvan street with zero gas. we get RIGHT onto the highway, with the heat and music blasting--singing, dancing--and the car breaks down. right on the side of the highway. we were cracking up, til it started to get wiiiiicked cold. then we were like shit. so we called mr. kumph, he brought us gas, and we were good.</P>
<P>but it was really good hanging out with everyone.<BR>then later on keech came for a visit. went to cumby's but ipswich has contaminated water or something, so the gulps were broken :(<BR>then went home.<BR><BR></P>
<P>friday i went out shopping with my mum at tj maxx and jo-ann fabrics. got material to cover the armrest in my car :)<BR>got phonecalls from meg foster and keech. they were at the guster concert. holy shit it sounded amazing!!!!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>today i went to starbucks with my dad in yeat town, drove a bit, and then went to the b-field 'brary with comp and mego. it was a good time actually!<BR>and now i'm going bowling with a bunch of people. oh, and t.bell!<BR>and tomorrow i'm selling nano raffle tickets w/christina outside crosby's. so please come???<BR>and then me xtina dani and michaela are getting B's coach gift thing.<BR>and then connor's coming over to study for math i believe? kinda sucks. we dont' hang out much anymore, but ohwellll.<BR>so a busy day. that's good. i love busy days. takes my mind of things.</P>
<P>and i just found out a TON of people are doing dance club. pretty friggin sweet. it'll be damn fuN!!!!!</P>

and i'm sorry livejournal. i know i promised to give you love and attention, but i haven't, and i'm sorry! it's just that people comment more on myspace 'cos it's somewhat new to gtown, and no one does in lj anymore....

i saw casey gasinowski in the library so that just about made my school year.
dean just laughed at her

after school i had soccer practice. i score three goals, which is amazing for me. too bad it was against our team though.

then we played some tag game. christina laughed at me. so i punched her. 
oh wait no i didnt.

she mooned the jivvos. 
oh wait no she didn't.but that woulda been funny.

then after practice i FELL DOWN THAT GODDAMN MOTHER OF A HILL going to the varsity game. i lauged. bug laughed at me. alana laughed. april couldnt stand up because she was laughing so hard. mr. swaime asked if i needed a bandaid. he makes me laugh. i heart him.


i got a free blueberry muffin from johnny's.
and a free butterfingers.

the guys lost 3-0 but it's okay. next time.


i decided to play soccer with the cool people who shoot on the net after the game. i took my first shot and it rolled really slow to RYAN BROWNER <3
so then i stopped shooting 'cos that's the jivva way.


i went to connor's tonight. do me.
i gave him a turtle i made in ceramics to cheer him up. he better cherish that thing with his life


in the spirit of red sox ('cos we all know i'm hardcore with my sports), i watched Fever Pitch when i got home. with jimmy fallon. do me. and drew barrymore, who was in E.T. as a child. do me.
mmm alien sex. kinky.

some girl in my ceramics class said her friend got stabbed by his coked-out dad, which was a scary story for me to hear in sheltered georgetown.

and connor got tomato soup in the last minute of lunch today, and was pissed. sorry connor, but it was funny :-)


and spanish was awesome, i'm pretty sure we ate all the munchkins, and 'back that thing up' made my day.


then soccer was amazing. i think xtina and i laughed the hardest possible.
and maddie was hyper!!!!!
and we played tag and tackled B 'cos we're jivvahs...and we can!
and i scrimmaged my brother today...'cos we're BOTH jivvahs!
hahhaa.


wow. stop being so cool soph.
so tonight i'm doing something
tomorrow day i'm [hopefully] doing something,

soccer's been gooood. we won our game yesterday 1-0, and watched the guys varsity game instead of practicing. had a wicked funny conversation with mrs.pero :-)

last night was pretty much amazing. me, christina, dani, and michaela went out to target to get te dye and shirts for the jivva sleepover tomorrow. almost died in the car like 25453 times. props to xtina :-) 
then visited B in The Loft, skipped through the mall, went to Bertucci's for some pizza, which me and xtina ended up eating, then brought some buns back to Jill. 
drove around blasting music and 'guy hunting' for christina, then headed home.

3. i haven't started my history essay, OR studied for that test on that book that i chose not to read...which is tomorrow. snap!

4. i'm getting my hair cut tomorrow.



Good Things:

1. i'm getting my hair cut tomorrow.

2. connor is the shit

3. i finished my two Venuti papers, AND the worksheet. i effing love english now.

4. i had my block party tonight, which was pretty friggin awesome. caught up on some times, and got pie in my face. mmmm.






and now the emmy's are singing some shitty classical music that is hurting my ear drums, so i'm going to bed before i go deaf.

"event","let's see. 
school was somewhat stressful this week. i just feel like i'm in over my head with hard classes. i'm too lazy for this shit!
i almost fall asleep in history and spanish--it's awful. but other than those two classes i like school.


didn't have soccer like all week, which has its pros and cons. though we DID have our spaghetti dinner on Thursday at tricia's. also listened to awesome music in xtina's car.
game was cancelled on thursday. manchester didn't want to get EEE. haha, suck it up.


yesterday we had alcohol flavored cake for dad's birthday. it was awkward tasting. 
then i went to connor's house.lost power while i was talking to mrs. pero and bitchell, which was funny. came home around 11:30


today austin picked me up in his new Audi, which is amazing.listened to some Dave Matthews, went to the Scoop, and caught up on life. mmm how emo.

then meg comp came over and we hung around. starting watching Mothman Prophcies but i got bored and changed it to Whatever It Takes i think it's called? with shane west? it was cute.


then i babysat in yeat town. i was bored and started taking pictures with the kids. and we watched Veggie Tales again. what an awesome movie.  The mom's having another baby so that'll be cool too!


just finished my venuti homework. took me a looooong time, but i actually like english so i decided to do it. history's another story.


hmmm and tomorrow i have a block party.that should be fun.



and does anyone find their hair looks good on the weekends, but AWFUL during the school week? i do. random. but i do.




so now that my carples tunnels is out of control. i'm out.

hung around with the norm after school, then i went to jax's house.
and tonight me jax pat and connor saw The Skeleton Key. con was in one of those bad moods at first cos he doesn't like scary movies and was rushed getting to the theater since it was last minute. but then he was fine.i think we almost shit our pants during the movie. see it. it was THAT good.  


i hafta miss the free Cake concert in boston tomorrow 'cos i hafta babysit in yeat town. boooooo. so someone should call my cell and let me listen for a minute :-)

"event","first day of school today. it was actually really fun, but i'm not gonna lie--the lectures get reaaaallllyyyy old and boring.

history/dudich : so i'm pretty much scared of her pop-quizzes and her 'raise your hand to talk' policy. but i hear she's cool, so i'm gonna give her a chance lol

spanish/diannini : awesome class. gonna be a good year

psychology/difranco : can we just go over how funny this class is?!? john kane wants to be called frisbee, danielle watts likes to play crocodile hunter, seano saw a movie this summer but he doesn't know what it is, and difranco dumped his girlfriend. i dunno me and t laughed a lot this class.

lunch is amazing.

algebra 2/bill pechil : boring class, good people.

h english 3/dr. venuti : he inspired me...his outlook on life and the world is AMAZING. holy shit. buuuuuut i hate reading, so i really hafta step it up this year. i'm with a lot of my best friends so this is good too :-)

h chem/martin : gonna be a tough year, but she's nice.

ceramics/cannon : me, stew, jax, and linds. it'll be good!



so pretty much today was funn! hung with jax leslie and kati after school, then had practice, which surprisingly went by real fast. we voted for captain today; i have my fingers crossed


and tomorrow that new show Reunion's on...i'm really excited! 


oh...and that crappy show the OC....

ha that's right xtina, i went there.

anyway. i can't really remember what i've been up to all week. i do rememeber being in pat's car a lot, i just can't remember why.


we'll just take it from friday.
so after that awful day of soccer practice, i went to whitey's with a bunch of people. played pool, watched team america, ate, took pictures, and played halo.


yesterday i worked on my summer work alllllll day. it was awful.
that night i went to connor's and it was awesome and ahhhh. i get the butterflies in my stomach just thinking about it. i &hearts; the butterflies :-)
and to top off an awesome night, his uncle Eugene came over with mr. pero. he is the shit!


sorry i rambled again.
doh!


today i went school shopping with my mum.it was a good time!
i'm staying in tonight, watching The Hot Chick on tv, eating coffee ice cream, and relaxing.



tomorrow i'm going to nick's house for a study group, then soccer practice, then definitely out. summer's coming to a close. this sucks dude.


as for me, it's back to the movie.
take it easy.

i'll try to avoid the long ass entry, but i can't promise.


so summer is coming to a close, friends are off to college, and as much as i hate to admit it, school cannot be avoided. one of the many things i have learned this summer is that time itself cannot be avoided. everything comes. there's a beauty to that. we'll talk about that some other time though...


so what has sophia been up to this past month?
lots. 
such as finishing up the month working. i must say parents night was a blast! we all went out to bertucci's after and had a bunch of laughs.

the next day i went to florida for almost two weeks. hung out with casey (from canada), and kay and nolwenn (from france).such a crazy experience, but it was a lot of fun! since summer soccer ended, i practiced on the beach. made some friends while i was dribbling up the beach.who knew that would be the way to make friends! haha.
shopped a lot so that was good...finally had moneyyyy.
my cousin trish is quite pregnant, so we went baby bedroom shopping.
and my cousin stacy gave me literally 60 cd's for my ipod. she friggin rocks.

had a bbq at joe's the other night. it was good fun!
went to the movies with a bunch of people and saw 'The 40 Year Old Virgin"". HILARIOUS movie.
moved some random table with pat and connor.
had an awesomeee double date with jax pat and connor--some of my favorite people!
oh right, had soccer try-outs this week too. i made jv by the way, which i'm fine with. it'll be a good season.

i've been having some problems lately, so i'm just trying to take things easy. i do not want to stress about ANYTHING this school year, so i'm just keeping myself occupied to keep my mind off of things. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

aside from soccer, i think i'm going to start taking hip-hop, which would be sick!


connor just left a few minutes ago, and it was exactly what i needed. it made me realize how he has made me a much stronger person over the past few years we've been friends, and i could not ask for more (song quote, i know). things are going to work out in every way with every thing. not just him, but things in general, and that's such a relief :-)




tomorrow i have a doctor's appointment, then my mom and i are going out for dinner. we decided we need to take every wednesday off to go out to dinner and just talk.so this is good.

i can't really remember what i've been doing the whole week, but on wednesday i think it was, connor and i took the train into boston and went out for thai food. it was a really good time! there was this fat guy dancing and humping people when they got onto the subway. funny. like, wicked. 


thursday was our last soccer game. we lost. it was fun while it lasted though.


on friday i babysat in the port from 4:30pm-1am. insanity. 


saturday made up for it all though. austin bug and whitey picked me up and we went to the port with a ton of people. ran into a bunch of people i knew. saw fireworks, then me em and christina slept over jax's house. good times. went out for breakfast at theo's this morning and then came home.


at like 11:30 my dad and i DROVE TO YORK BEACH, MAINE JUST TO GET ICE CREAM AT BROWN'S. as ridic as it sounds, it was well worth it. you just can't beat their ice cream. AND we brought home a gallon of wild maine blueberry ice cream...from maine. not ben and jerry's. but maine. ooo high roller.

then went to elsa's party thing. the limo was good.
then i got screamed at by my parents. that was cool.
mum said she can't wait to go to florida tomorrow cos she can't deal with me any longer. but then she also said she loved me, so i don't know what to believe anymore.
i came to realize i just plain don't feel like dealing with certain things. i'm like depressed, but happy at times too. so i dont know. it's like when i'm with some people, i forget problems, but when i'm alone i get sad about people. it's complicated. oh well.


saturday connor came to the port and helped my fam work the greek food festival. as awful as it appears, it was actually wicked fun! we worked the gyro booth, then got lazy and walked around looking like we were actually doing stuff. everywhere we went we goofed off and got like kicked out. i.e. the fried dough stand. we were throwing dough in the oil and eating all the food. then we walked around the port, layed in the grass, and caught up on stuff. then met up with jax and pat, and then went to connor's house. played pool, went in the hottub, and ate. we ate so much it was awfulllll... ly good.


today i worked the festival. it was pretty good. my parents were taking shots with maria stefanos (the channel 5 newsanchor). i'm not sure if it was awkward or cool...
also went food shopping since it's just me and daddy-o for the next like 3 weeks. 


and now i'm thinking of watching a movie with the fam before they all leave tomorrow morning.

"event","so this week at work has been simply amazing.

i guess i'll tell some funny stories, though i'm pretty sure they may not be funny to anyone who reads them. actually, i'm positive they won't be funny.


yesterday andrew and allie ripped off the head of the turtle float for the pool. so aaron put it on his head, layed on the ground, and made weird orgasming noises and moved his arms and legs (he was being a turtle). it was hilarious at the time

THEN, griff walks by with these ninja turtle sword things, so i ask what it's for, and he says 'cheap abortion'. probably offensive to a lot of people, and not very funny, but it's griff, so the way he said it was.


that night i went to the loop with ex-cedardalers and saw Wedding Crashers, which was hilarious by the way. it was nice to catch up on like, a years' worth of news.



today was the Gong Show. jorge, meg, liz, and ellen were the judges, and opened up with 'Footloose'. Of course, jorge 'stole the show' cos he's an amazing dancer and all. 

then ian, ben, and danny's group came on stage with wicked tigt, skanky shorts and a rolled up shirt  and danced to 'Booty-licious'. there was so much guy-on-guy humping it was hilarious. so about 400 kids between the ages of 4 and 13 were exposed to dirty dancing at a young age. scarred for life. they ended up winning. 


enough about work. it's definitely boring for people to read about, so i guess i'll mosey along.


had a soccer game today. won 2-1. i'm really enjoying this team. it's funnnn!


tonight at like 9 pre, whitey, aussie, and joe picked me up and we went to pre's for a BONFIRE. it was good. saw xtina emma and elsa, who i missed dearly :-)


and now i'm making a truffle cake thing for tomorrow.

with that said, i'm out.

so sunday i went over bug's house with a bunch of people. went to McDonald's and then went to aussie's and sat in his backyard talking. and i saw joe for the first time in 325235 years, so that was coo too.

monday was work, and THE SEASON PREMIERE OF LAGUNA BEACH!!! 
around 8:00, mego em and meg comp came over. then t and mark. made hemp and got pumped, and then sully, chris, pat, jax, pre, austin, and bug came over to watch Laguna. (it was awesome by the way). but there was a catch to it. earlier on i bet bug $10 he wouldnt come and watch it, and then at 10 they came..i think becuase a. bug wanted money, and b. sully likes the show. 
so bug's laying on the ground and pat goes 'havin fun over there bug?', and he has hemp wrapped in a noose around his neck. so funny!



today was an aweeeesome day of work! i actually like it there!
now i have a soccer game, and then connor's coming over for our yea-and-a-half. we're keeping it low-key and eating chinese takeout and whatnot. <3

hmmmmmmmmmm.
well, work's been fun! last week me, john, allison, and meg had early/late. it was actually good! and ended with a grand fanale of breakfast at theo's.

had my doctor's appointment..that was the only bad part, but hey what can ya do.
i saw willy wonka.but i think i updated on that already. had soccer on tuesday.

wednesday i hung out with dean and keech. went to bucky burrito's and plum island, so that was good.

thursday em picked me up and we visited jax during her groundation (which she's off of now :-)), and went to the scoop. then hung out with dean keech and tommy. 


after early/late on friday, i got ready and meg foster picked me up and we went to liz's with katie. then sonya joined. then sarah, baize, and jess. we went glow bowling at Pilgrim Lanes. it was awesome! no techno music, but our bowling skills made up for it.
we were gonna go to this retro diner in portsmouth that opens on friday and doesn't close 'til sunday. but it was 11:00 and some people had to go home soon. so instead we went to the Wam. saw some georgetown people in there as well, so that was cool. got home around 12. 


saturday i went to mego's with meg comp and we tanned at her neighbor's pool since they were on vacation. then meg went to get her hair cut so we went to bug's with con and played Twisted Metal for 3 hours. normally i'd complain if people were playin video juegos, but this was a GOOD game! whitey, chris, dave, and mego joined later on. 

left at like 5:45 and went home and ate. then headed to connor's. saw his senior pictures. I LOOOVE THEM! :-)


today i went grocery shopping with stacey. finally have good food in here. right now i'm babysitting ness while my parents are at my uncle's wake. then tonight i'm going out i believe.

tomorrow we may be going to Fire and Ice for jess' bday, but i'm not really sure. i hear it's expensive, and i'm not one for spending large amounts of money

then tuesday's me and connor's year-and-a-half:-) time flies. seriously.

and wednesday i may be going to see Wedding Crashers with some ex-dale people. we shall see.


that is all. 
i'm thinking of going for a run now.
hope everyone's summer is going great :-)

friday after work joe and xtina picked me and meg comp up at my house and we did the cups to the bridge after some random guy from Maine ripped the originals down. so if anyone sees 'Happy BDay Cull' on the bridge going over tenney, holla at me

then i took a nice hot shower after being in the pouring rain, and went to austin's with whitey, pat jax and con. and hey weird--they played Halo 2! Who woulda guessed?! then we went to connor's and watched Team America. that movie was so awful is was hilarious.


saturday, sarah picked me and mego up and we went to the port for a free concert. met up with megan, baize, jess, liz, and danny. saw cara tommasino as well, so that was aweeesome! the bands were really good. there was some celtic rock band called the dubliners who i really digged. 
then the dale people left and i met up with whitey, chris, meg, and jax. pat connor bug and austin came a little later, so it was a good time.me and jax danced and def didnt wanna go..but then it poured. shopped for a little and got food. 
after that me jax and con went to pats. lol that was fun. danced to music and then slept over jax's :-)


today i just chilled. caught up on some much needed sleep, went to the flea market and bought dice, and then made a hemp nexklace outta them dice. woot.

and i just ate three bowls of ice cream, got sick of re-scooping, so i'm just eating from the carton now :-)


camp tomorrow. vanessa's first day. so cute.
with that said, i'm out.
peace!"

"event","the past few days have been AMAZING!
on tuesday connor came back from NH, so he came over to see me. it was the perfect setting. there was the new Hot Hot Heat cd playing in the house, and he said he missed me, and we hugged and just looked at eachother, and talked about our weekend and problems and made eachother laug. it was awesome. cheesy, but awesome.

wednesday kelsa went on her rampage, and me meg liz and katie were the main victims. basically she told me i could look for employment elsewhere if i wanted to for next year, and screamed and made me cry. so yeah i don't really like my boss.

and to top it all off, later on in the day she's like 'oh shit i just screamed at my counselors in front of the campers. i could get in trouble for this..' so she started being nicer.she told people she loved me, i was a great counselor, and that i was a stylish lifeguard. so i really don't know if she likes me or not anymore.and i don't care...


anyway. that night me, em, xtina, morg, julianne, and jax went to the port and stuff. got ice cream even though we werent hungry, then went to famous and got ice cream adn it was the funniest point of my summer.

""you guys it's not like we're in canada. we're in NEWBURYPORT. of course we're gonna see them again""

then linds joined us. it was a very fun night :-) 


today i had work. it was duck day. woop woop. jon, tj, and sarah all visited so far, so it makes me happy. and all the counselors are getting closer, so that's good. this summer should be fun.
then i had a soccer game in dracut. we won 3-0, so that's good

i really wanna go to a concert. i'm in florida when warped tour comes here, so i'm quite upset about that.  looks like i'll find another one.


ah, i &hearts; summer

with that said, i'm out.

"event","so the good always shows through the bad. i have come to the conclusion that whenever i'm home, i'm depressed. i'm so sick of the pressure and pms my family puts on me.they're happy one minute, then yelling at me the next. i give up..i'm so sick of being upset when i'm here. i feel bad saying this, but it really is the truth. like i have never been this depressed when it's summer.

anyway. minus the two days of depression, i've been having fun.

saturday night i went to whitey's.  we listened to music, played guitar, and watched dean's skateboard videos. it actually ended up being a really good time


on sunday keech picked me up and we went to the scoop. then we got james and visited kmac at steve's. the people who work there are so funny! then we bought food at crosby's and cressy's, and me and keech went to the port. bought the Hot Hot Heat and Foo Fighters cd [they are excellent, let me tell you], salt scrub, and stickers.

'funny story': so we're in Dyno Records looking at cds, and we come across 'Hello, my name is George little"" under the local bands section. so we ask the guy working there what type of music it is, and he says it's a one-man-band who plays acoustic and harmonica.we think nothin of it and put it back, and later, keech decides he's gonna get it. so the guy at the register says that he IS George Little, and that that cd has been on the shelf for 4 years, and he was happy someone was buying it. so we got his autograph and listened to the cd on the way home, and it's good! small, small world...


then we went back to keech's and tried the salt scrub on our hands, and keech burned me the Phish and George Little cd :-)

came home and hung out with some camp friends for a little. then shane picked me up and we went to the fireworks in danvers with whitey, mich mang, pre, colin, emily, dave, robbie, and xtina. it was a really good time! danced to the fireworks, and went to Cumby's TWICE!! ohh yes.


today i'm not sure what i'm doing.i was gonna go to NH for the day, but mum said there would be too much traffic. whateverr. 

so i'm really not sure what's going on. i'm thinkin cookout tonight

this is long, so comment i guess.

"event","<P>today started out good, but ended pretty rough. i guess i'll recap. i'm babysitting so i have plenty of time..</P>
<P>so camp was fabulous. i was pretty tired, but we had a day of greatness. <BR>cheeseburgers and hotdogs, ice cream sundaes, game day, frisbee, chillin out, and <STRONG>payday</STRONG>. as in sophia's first paycheck ever. it was amazing. and jorge is the funniest guy i have ever met.</P>
<P>then i came home and slept while my mum and ness went to bry's baseball game. dad came home and we started talking about friends, new hampshire, the family, and random stuff. yeah it basically ended in a fight with me bawling my eyes out and being all depressed, and dad saying 'fuck everyone' and driving away. i don't really know where he went. i'm thinking bry's baseball game.&nbsp;i <EM>hope</EM> bry's baseball game. i left to go babysitting so i haven't seen the fam yet. i made my dad feel like shit, and now i feel like shit. and i hate being a teenager and living under the family's rules and having the family contradict themselves by letting me do stuff then not let me do the same thing again and i need the girls so bad right now but i've only seen two of them all summer which is weird becuase i'm used to seeing them all school year and i'm so confused and left out and messed up and i'm rambling but it feels good and i just don't wanna be left behind and why am i sad i have such a good life but i feel like i want other people's lives and the rules they don't have becuase it's not fair and i just want to be happy right now and i hate how my mood can be changed by random stuff like this and i hate getting jealous of guys and girl friends and ex-girlfriends and girls i haven't truly met yet yet they're hanging out right now and i get worried even though i honestly don't need to it's just that once im in a meh mood more things add on and irritate me when they normally wouldn't in 'real life' and i really don't want my 4th of july to be ruined and i feel really bad for getting the family mad at me because it's always my fault and i hate seeing my family mad at me but oh how i want them to loosen up like things were this whole year.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>wow. that felt...good. so there's the gist of what i'm feeling right now and yeah. i guess i just need someone to talk to.<BR>i mean other than that things have been good, lol. soccer game where we got creamed beyond belief, but i was extremely proud of myself for how i played. then went to chris' and play MOH and ate andy's blueberries. tomorrow's alexis' college graduation party..with a keg. hahaha.</P>
<P>i just don't even know right now. i think i need to meditate again. it felt so good last time i did it.</P>"

"event","last night was the revolution game with connor, the bitchells, and the soccer team. it was a goooood time. it was actually really funny.
when we got there there were two jamaican guys doing tricks with a soccer ball...it was amazing.
the game was good. revs won 4-2. i owe two buckets of chicken wangs 'cos i suck at making bets.
game ended at like 9 and we sat in the car waiting for the traffic to stop.  had some wicked good talks til 11:30, then headed home. 

today i'm going to the beach. should be a good time.
then babysitting my sister and her 'boyfriend'. should be a not good time.

and it started off great!
yesterday after school, me jax and pat went to the port to grab some food. so here i am, thinking there was a surprise birthday at jax's house for her. so i'm planning around it, and people were acting weird 'cos i knew about it. then we pull up to jax's house, and there's like 25 people standing in the driveway with a sign that says ""Surprise Sophia and Jax!"" it was amazing. i had NO idea it was for me too! ah i love my friends so much!
there were tacos and a characteture and we all got our pictures drawn. he drew me with big boobs, which was sweet.
went swimming, ate, tanned, and got hit with squirtguns. it was a good time.
then we said bye to Ellen and me jax and lisa were BAWLING our eyes out. it was awful. i will miss that girl SO much it's insane. she seriously changed me as a person...


at like 6:30 i went to the Pero Family Reunion. it was a good time. so many different people. there's black, oxygen-tankers, a GORGEOUS girl, and some random chinese guy that no one knew. he was just..there.
the bitchells and jax were there too so that was coo. got a little slow when the guys got too tired to function, but then they drove and were better. so yeah, that was my night.


now i just woke up, and summer's kicking in.
i might be beachin' it, going to nh, or who knows today.

"event","mmm. sounds like reggae. which sounds like beach. which sounds like summer. which sounds like no school. i could go on for hours..


but i won't.
anyway. today was greatttt!!
had my math final, which was weird 'cos i was actually in the mood to take. uncool, right? right.
then went to johnnie's for some food, then had it in the cafe.
spanish final wasn't bad either, which was a great relief.
tomorrow's gonna blow chunks though. english and history. i love english, but what an english final REALLY means is the writing of extensive essays. really. look it up in the dictionary.

after school i went to connor's house. it was amazing. we played halo 2 with jax and pat for a bit too. laughed very hard. then went to tj maxx and the cleaners. kaminski caught me. i returned my band outfit hoping i wouldn't have to dryclean it. clearly didn't work.

tomorrow me and em are going to the nemeroff's to clean the house for $20/hour. not gonna be too too bad
then who knows. soccer was cancelled.


i'm also pathetically excited to listen to the cd jenni burned for joe on the carride to school. hawthorne heights, SOMETHING CORPORATE, rhcp, straylight run. can we ask for more people?!


okay i'm done rambling.
chris made me realize no one comments. i hit 30 comments in one entry ONCE. now it's down to like, 2. tops. and it's because i like comment to myself. wow stop sophia.

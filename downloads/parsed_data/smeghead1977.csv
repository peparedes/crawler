Lately I've even found myself being....optimistic about a future career. I can't afford to ride out my head trips anymore. I think it may be time for some drastic self behavioral modifications. I think its time I quit being such a douche bag."

I was captured. the next thing I knew I was in a room with my comrades. We were all skinned and in total agony. I had to find out where my skin was so I was searching all around until I found it in a slaughter house in a bloody heap in the corner. I picked it up and draped it over myself and I thought that if I put it back on it would heal back onto my body."

"event","So I watched ""Stargate"" again the other day. You know, the first one. Where aliens built the pyramids? Because we all know that those African savages could never build something like that, so aliens must have helped them. Same thing with the Mayan temples, those injuns can't do stuff like that! Must have been aliens! When the nerdy guy met the ancient egyptian girl, who was conspicuously pale with hazel eyes something occurred to me. Every Hollywood movie that covers the ""stranger in a strange land"" concept has the same formula: white guy goes to brown land and is better at being brown than the brown people. White guy meets brown girl that isn't really brown and romance ensues. 
Which is why I now believe that ""The Black Knight"" is the best movie of all time. Black guy get transported back in time to old Europe, teaches the savage white folk a thing or two, meets the conspicuously brown white girl, romance ensues and the black guy saves the day. Pure poetry."

Seriously, I do.
Last night I had a nightmare. I don't get them to often but this one hit me pretty hard.
There was a girl, she was standing on a frozen lake. In front of her was a hole in the ice. She turned to me and said ""I must do this"" and jumped in.
I think I am starting to understand."

"event","Why is it that throughout my life I continually encounter and befriend people of the same archetypes? This is not simply making friends with the same interests. Its as though every time that I relocate the same people are reincarnated into a new social group. Friends that look the same, act the same, think the same as they did in previous places. Rockford friends reincarnated into Saudi friends reincarnated into Navy friends reincarnated into Montana friends. Are they doppelgangers? Same situations, I've been here before. I've met you before. I've said this before. I've heard this before.
If I could figure this out I think I would know a lot more about whats below the algae green waters of my mind."

"event","Today actually has been not so bad.  I've felt worse physically than mentally, which is of course because of my crapass work schedule.  Whereas the past few days, it's been pretty equal.  I'm still tired all the time, and my biological clock is now officially completely backward.  Slept from about 10:30 this morning to 4:30 this afternoon, tried to eat dinner before I left for the P-I but wasn't hungry.  I've been eating ""dinner"" around midnight...well actually, I tried to for the first time last night and felt much better at work.  Was actually chatty and more awake than usual, although it probably also had something to do with the guy I was sitting by, Jeffrey.  Really nice guy, really cool, really easy to talk to.  I like him and hope he and I will be able to hang out even after our MSNBC stint is over.  I feel that way about all of the friends I've made there; all very cool people.  Although Michael, funny as he is, tends to give me a headache with all his incessant talking so early in the morning.

Looking forward to the weekend and having Saturday off, even though I have to be at MSNBC at 1 on Sunday morning.  It'll be nice being off from MSNBC on Monday and Tuesday.  I never thought I'd be so excited about Mondays and Tuesdays.  Too bad I have to work at the P-I both of those days.

Despite all of my complaining about how tired I am and how cracked out my schedule is, I'm going to miss the MSNBC job when it's over.  I wonder if I'd be able to get on with them fulltime.  I was talking to my boss George earlier today, and when I mentioned being interested in working there fulltime he said it would be great.  I don't know if that'll actually translate into it happening, but we'll see.  I think I've just been at the P-I for too long.  That, plus I'm tired of all the red tape there, and the few upper-level assholes who think they're above it all.

Am hoping to catch a movie on Saturday but I don't know if I'll be up for it.  I want to see ""Collateral"" or ""Open Water,"" though there are a bunch more I also want to catch before they leave the theaters.  Still need to see the complete ""I, Robot."" =p

Shit, it's 9.  Gotta get back to work."

"event","I watched the ladies SPs about an hour ago.  I won't even get into the whole MK's time thingy -- what I wanna know is where the FUCK are the deductions for Ando and Arakawa??  The second jump of Miki's combo was severely pre-rotated and underrotated at the end; the first jump of Shizuka's combo was underrotated quite a bit, and the second jump was horribly underrotated by about 1/2 a turn.  I can't remember the ""mandatory"" deductions off the top of my head, but I believe it should've been anywhere from 0.1-0.3 depending on how severe.  I'd have taken off 0.2 for Shizuka's combo and probably the same for Miki's.  Not to mention both of them lipped horribly as well, so that should've been another deduction right there.  And if the judges deducted for MK's ""traveling"" spin (honestly, it wasn't *that* bad) then they should've done the same for Shizuka's camel.  Yet both Shizuka and Miki got quite a bit of 5.8s and even a few 5.9s for technical merit.  It seems like the judges are rewarding merely *trying* the 3/3s...who cares how you actually land them.  Whatever. *rolls eyes*

I was heartened watching MK, though.  Her jumps were rock solid, perfect landings, and she didn't look ""slow"" or ""tentative"" or ""cautious"" like some people claim.  She wasn't quite on with the music so I can see maybe a 5.8 for pres, but 5.6 and 5.7 is absurd.  Sasha deserved first place on the merit of her better spins, and better selling her program than MK did.  Wouldn't call it 6.0-worthy, but the judges have been handing out 6.0s like candy all Worlds long so I guess they don't mean as much anyway.  Oh, and the judge who gave MK a 5.1 for tech merit?  Should be shot.

Anyway, I think it's safe to say I will eat my hat if MK somehow wins Worlds this year.  To do that, she would have to win the SP and hope Smasha finishes 4th or lower -- and let's be realistic, there is no way the judges will place Sasha that low unless she has the meltdown of the century.  I think she would have to fall three times before the judges even consider it, and well, she usually only falls twice. =P  And that's not counting Miki and Shizuka holding up their end of the deal and skating well enough for some combo of silver and bronze.  Yup, with the way things are going I'll be thrilled to see MK get the silver.  I just hope she goes out there and does her thing and is happy with how she performs in the end.  Just say ""screw everyone"" and go for it.

Oh, and yes, I was a dork and timed MK's SP.  FYI, I got 2:40.18 from the time she started moving to the time she stopped.  *siiigh* So it appears she *was* over 2:40.  Man, that totally blows.  There's supposed to be a ruling on it ""within 24 hours,"" but it doesn't matter anyway because the referee's ruling is going to stand no matter what.  There's no way to undo him having assessed the time penalty.  MK's stuck with it, he's stuck with it, we're stuck with it.  He might get some kind of sanction later if it is found he was in the wrong, but the current results can't/won't change.  This Worlds sucks.  Maybe Michael, Jenny and I should just get trashed tomorrow night instead. =P"

Me: Uhhh...shouldn't we throw those out?
Grace: It's OK. It's still good!

Me: Nuh uh, we're row B, and this is row...oh.

Me: Hi, it's Sarah.  No wait, it's not.  Hi Sarah, it's Hayley.
(trying to make a phone call after waaay too little sleep)

""Oh HELL no...""
(Me at Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, after realizing Heather, Grace and I almost left without seeing Michelle's wax figure)

""Look, Wayne is checking out Michelle's ass!""

Grace: Probably.
Me: Did you say ""Paboyah?""
Grace: No, I said ""Probably.""
Me: Oh.  I knew that.

-snacks that we think look good and go with water
-something gummi (no bears)
-something good in a movie theater so we don't have to use their stuff

Me, at DR, holding up a bag of chips: Does this count as...hang on...(looks at Grace's list)...""something good in a movie theater so we don't have to use their stuff""?

My hair is ""natural"" dark brown again.  I say ""natural"" because I had to dye it back that color after all the highlighting.  Man, it looks so dark!  It looks so strange to me after having highlighted hair for the past couple years.  But hopefully I'll be used to it in a few days.  At least the people who have noticed so far like it.  My boss says it looks good, and I trust his word on physical appearance type things more than most people's...so I guess it's alright.

Ugh, I'm dreading having to work that double at the P-I tonight.  I miss Cynthia and Julie.  At least they're enjoying Seoul so far.  They called me a few nights ago, actually Cynthia called and I talked to her first...all the while Julie was in the background singing ""chokarak!  chokarak!"" over and over again.  ""Chokarak"" = ""chopsticks"" in Korean, which she'd just learned how to say, and she was so proud of herself that she felt the need to make a song about it.  That girl is a nut.  But then, I remember when Chrissy and I used to make up songs about being able to drive in the carpool lane to Bellevue and back.  HEY, having carpool for the 520 is a big deal, give us a break, ok? =P

"event","Boy, am I a sight to behold right now.  I just finished the Hangul to the below-mentioned Bada song (that beautiful one she sang in that vid) and I'm sitting here wiping away the tears that were streaming down my face.  That song is so haunting.  And I can relate so well to it right now, blech.  The English translation is coming soon...I'll try to get it done before I leave for San Diego next Sunday, but if not then maybe I can finish it down there.  To everyone who's been eagerly awaiting it, hold your horses a bit longer. ^_^

To start on a positive note, congrats a million times over to MK for her eighth consecutive national championship!!  That girl is UNBELIEVABLE.  Every time she does something spectacular, I think, ""there's no way I could possibly be more in awe of her""...and then she goes and blows me away all over again.  I still am not crazy about Tosca the program, but her performance was brilliant.  It's like she took off for another planet when she launched into her fw sequence, WOW.  No wonder she finished so ahead of her music -- she FLEW through the fw.  MK is one of the best athletes ever.  Not just one of the best skaters.  One of the best athletes.  Ever.  To keep delivering time and time again, with the quality of performances she has, is incredible.  And I get really sick of people saying she should retire if she's not going to do blahblahblah, yadayadayada.  I still can't believe Val actually said that.  It's sad she thinks that way when she used to be such a loyal fan.  And it's sad for anyone to think like that, period.  MK has given SO much to the sport and has never asked for anything in return. *shakes head*

Boy, the pairs event sure stunk this year.  Michael and I were sitting there trying not to fall asleep during the LPs.  I seriously think he and I actually spent more time watching my screensaver (pics slideshow) than the skating.  Finally I had to shut my monitor off when the ladies came back on, cuz it kept distracting us.  And are he and I the only evil ones, or did the bloopers segment of that U.S. skaters fluff piece crack anyone else up? ^^;;

Feeling a bit overwhelmed, on top of the usual shittiness, that I'll be in San Diego this time next week, and that my interview is in about one week and 12 hours from now.  Eeeeeeeek!! @_@  I feel like I have so much to do here before I go, so many loose ends to tie up...and I have so little time to do it.  But I'm really looking forward to going down, regardless of whether the job works out.  And it'll be great to see Grace and Yvonne and Borany.  Gracie-ya, I hope you're not getting sick but if you are, get better before I come down! ^_^

"event","It's 24 right now.  Degrees.  Farenheit.  I am SO COLD.  My fingers have barely any feeling in the tips.  Have I mentioned I'm inside a heated building?  At least the P-I isn't as cold as my room was earlier today -- I had the heat up full blast and the cold was still biting.  The side roads coming up were complete ice.  I can't believe it's going to be colder these next few days.  They're predicting *10* tonight, and supposedly another storm on Tuesday.  I can't believe it's this cold and we're not getting snow at the moment.  Freezing + no snow = SUCK.

I'm getting to the point where I don't even know how to describe how I'm feeling.  The only things I know are that I still feel shitty but I can also sense something's changing.  What exactly, or why, I have no clue.  I guess I'll just have to wait.

I'm so tired right now...tired and cold.  For some reason the evening drives to Seattle put me to sleep.  Must be the combination of my car's heater and the darkness, but I've been sitting here all night struggling to stay alert.  And of course, the instant I get home and shower I'll perk up again and then my sleeping schedule will be totally wonked.  Greaaaat.  I'm back to a normal work schedule this week, which will be good even though I mostly enjoyed my time off.  I *really* need to start hitting the gym regularly again...it's been over a week since I've gone and I can feel the difference in terms of my energy level and such.

Damn Packers for winning today.  Now I have to endure at least another week of being paranoid of typing ""Green Gay"" at work. >_<"

It's called ""Love Game"" and it's off their 5.5 album, the last one they made before they split.  Don't let the song title fool you...it doesn't sound the way it seems like it might.  Very funky/bluesy with a good beat and great singing."

One, I probably won't have to go to my UW job unless all the snow suddenly magically disappears by tomorrow morning.  Two, well, it's snowing.  Most people up here love their snow, I dunno exactly why but they do.  If you don't believe me you can go to www.seattlepi.com and take a look at the latest poll results.  Anyway, I went outside to survey whether I would even be able to drive up our hill tomorrow morning, and promptly pulled a Cynthia and almost fell flat on my @$$ just stepping onto our back porch.  Hmmm.  Outlook of making it to work tomorrow not so good.  Wonder how our puppy will take to the snow...probably not too well.  He was outside earlier while it was just beginning to fall and he just sat on the porch and stared at it.

Oh for fuck's sake, I just uploaded the wrong Isak N Jiyeon song to post here. *grumbles to self*  On second thought, nm the Isak N Jiyeon for now.  The song I was going to post the link to is about sucky love, so I'll have to find a different one by them.  Ooooh I know, I've got a really cool/funky S.E.S one to upload.  Which means I have to go back out in the snow to go to my car to get the CD. *more grumbling to self*  OK, hang on..."

I'm going to the doctor in about like, 9 hours from now.  Need to find out what is wrong with me.  I can't believe this shit.  I have three days off in a row for the first time in a bajillion years and I can't really even do anything.  I ran errands for a few hours this evening and felt like total shit the whole time.  Then I came home and did basically nothing.  Which of course afforded more time for overthinking.  Kind of ironic how my being alone is probably the last thing that's good for me these days, but I don't want much company anyway.  Where the heck is everyone these days?  Yeesh, no wonder I feel so alone.  Blech...going to bed so I can overthink in my dreams. =P"

"event","Work is so boring right now.  There's always a lull between about 8-9 before the first-edition deadline crunch.  I was speaking Korean to myself a little earlier (shush) and I've somehow developed the goofiest accent.  I'm not even sure if it's an English accent but whatever it is, it needs to go away NOW. >_<  My tongue has also gotten really lazy...I'm slurring all over the place.  I was at the store earlier talking to this cashier, and she kept giving me this look during our convo like she couldn't make out some of the words I was saying.  Thus me speaking Korean to myself, trying to figure out what the heck is going on.

I hate how superficial many Koreans are.  Kpop is almost exclusively image-driven these days, as evidenced by Hyolee winning all the major daesangs this year.  And then there's Eugene getting so much plastic surgery that she sometimes doesn't even look Asian in certain pics, and Ock Ju Hyun getting plastic surgery and losing like, half her chin in the process @_@ and just every Korean teenager seems to want to be a star and look like a star -- hence why plastic surgery is so huge over there.  And even the adults are obsessed with looks.  The Korean media has actually written stories about Korean men who marry these hot women, and then the women get pregnant and have uglyass babies and the men are confoozed cuz they don't realize their wives are so beautiful cuz they're PLASTIC.  

And there's this completely absurd fad of uhljjangs, who are basically people famous because they look good...""uhl"" = face (""uhlkool"" is the full word for face) and ""jjang"" = best...so yes, the whole concept behind uhljjangs is basically having the ""best face.""  That's IT.  Just looks, nothing else.  These men and women are famous for no other reason than being handsome or beautiful, and they have all these chatrooms and stuff dedicated to people who want to discuss their looks.  And uhljjangs are really popular cuz people buy into it, that's the worst part.  Julie and Cynthia are NUTS for wanting to move over there.  I mean, it'd be nice to visit, but *live*?  Man, I dunno.

Today has been so bizarre...I keep thinking it's Sunday since I had yesterday off, and usually the only full day I ever have off is Saturday.  I think I ate too many rich foods yesterday (prime rib, dips, cheesecake) because I've felt nauseated almost all day long.  And tired, I've been SO tired too.  I can't remember the last time I felt this tired...it's strange.  I was talking to a couple friends online this afternoon and then I crashed in the middle of our convos and went to lay down for a little nap that turned into a little *two-hour* nap.  Oops.  Pried myself out of bed for work, and now here I am.  Probably just going to spend the first part of my day tomorrow lounging, but then I'm going out at night...last hurrah for Cynthia, Julie and me before they leave Sunday.  Blech..."

"event","Ya know, I don't get why the livejournal people made ""irritated"" a mood option when people don't get ""irritated,"" they get ""annoyed.""  *Things* get irritated...like, your throat gets irritated.  *People* get annoyed.  Anyway I'll shut up now.  Just ignore me...it's the copy editor in me showing through. ^_^

I'm really pissed at Ben.  I know, you're thinking ""well DUH"" or ""what else is new?"" but I have a new reason!  Anyone who knows me well will tell you how much I loooooove everything about Christmas -- giving presents, seeing downtown Seattle all decorated, the music, etc.  It's probably the one time of the year I most look forward to.  So where does Ben figure into this?  He ruined it for me this year.  I'm not being harsh on the guy...I'm totally justified in saying that.  Last Christmas we were together as good friends who were starting to fall in love, and this Christmas he supposedly still loves me but had decided I cause him too much pain to deal with me.  So what happens?  I get the boot from his life.  That's SO fucking weak.  One of our mutual friends remarked last night that he thinks Ben is trying to make himself stop loving me.  Part of me says ""Well fine, if you're going to be a fucking ass then I don't want you in my life,"" but it's just not that easy.

The next week or so is going to be the biggest test for me.  I made it through Christmas somehow, but Cynthia and Julie leave in two days, then the day after that is Ben's b-day, then two days later is New Year's Eve.  I made my ""present"" for Ben last night -- handwritten lyrics to this one song that we used to listen to together that has since become so ironically fitting of our (non) relationship.  That's the last thing I'm going to do to reach out to him.  I don't expect any sort of real response.  It's just the last thing I want to convey to him before I try to obtain closure.  Maybe deep down inside, part of me is doing this to give him one last chance.  But I'm not holding my breath.  His stubbornness borders on idiocy when he thinks he's right.

Wish I could be home in bed right now...stupid work."

I hated you a lot 
Even your pure face that made me so happy 
I hated myself even more for thinking miserably
That you'd come back after I woke from this sleep 
Now I made a promise that I won't keep, 
To forget everything about you 
The memories make me wearier and wearier 

*chorus
Come back to me if you're not too far 
If you still love me... 
I am still waiting for you right here 
If you already forgot about me, 
I'll wait a little longer so I can hate myself more

It's been such a long time since you've left 
I forgot everything, including our loving memories 
But I don't know why these tears are falling 
I walk down the street where I met you 
Am I having a hard time again? 
I say to myself that I can laugh it all off 
I kept telling myself that I don't have even one memory of you left 

repeat * 

It's really too late 
You already left 
But I can't forget you 
I believed that I forgot you 
But really, I believed that you'd surely come back 
Maybe I have to hate you and miss you til the end 
When you left I had a harder time 
Please come back to me baby 
If you remember me again, 
If you come back to me again 
I am always here waiting"

"event","man, i can't stop listening to this song.  they sound *SO* good together.  all the american boy bands such as n*sync and backstreet boys, they've got nothing on s, and s isn't even a ""real"" group, just three very talented guys who collaborated on a project album!  i've got kangta's part down so well it's scary...and a bit perplexing that i've got a guy's part down like that. o.O  i mean of course i don't sound like a guy, but my voice actually sounds good over his.  and i sound pretty decent singing hyesung's part too.  jihoon and i don't match at ALL...it's very odd how that works.  but that's why i can't ever sing eugene's parts either, at least not over her own voice.  it sounds terrible.  we have totally different tones.  ya know, she has a really unique voice...now that i think about it, i don't know of anyone else who sounds even remotely like her.

today feels so odd...it feels like i'm wasting it for some reason.  i woke up around 8 but forced myself to go back to sleep, then i came online around 10 and chatted for a couple hours before leaving for work.  then i get to work (where i still am) and find barely anyone around, and nothing for me to do.  greaaaaaat.  i drove all the way up to seattle for nothing.  actually i shouldn't say ""nothing.""  at least now i can stop by the u village on my way home to look for a pretty pair of earrings for my mom for christmas.  and mail my package for that editor in san diego.

it feels so weird to have the night off from the p-i.  i usually work every friday, and fridays are usually crazy.  i almost feel like i don't know what to do with myself.  hmmm, maybe my mom and i can go out to dinner or something.  still not sure if i'm going to make the karaoke with cynthia, julie and sejin cuz cynthia's grandma is visiting from california for the holidays and to see cynthia before she leaves.  and you know what a big deal family is in asian cultures, especially elders, so she can't just be running around everywhere while her grandma is up.  *siiiigh*  i can't believe they leave in 9 days.  just typing that, i feel like crying.

eh well...gonna run to the u village now."

"event","ok, having a xanga and a livejournal is ahjoo confoozing.  i don't know which one to update anymore, cuz half my friends have xanga and the other half have this.  why can't all of you just use the same frickin thing?? ^^

funny story of the day: one of my bosses told me that his buddy i met briefly last week thinks i'm hot and wants to hook up with me.  here's how my boss tells it: ""yo man, what's up with that girl you were with?  is she your girl?  she was lookin good...""  ""nah, we're cool but just friends.""  ""well tell her i'm available and i got a job and can support her...""  it's like, dude, you deal weed for a living.  how about, oh let's see...NO?

for some reason i've been totally beyond exhausted the past couple days.  even working out didn't help me this morning.  i perked up while i was in the middle of working out, of course, but then as soon as i got into my car it was like a hypnotist snapped their fingers and put me in a trance, and i had trouble even keeping my eyes open! @_@  and like right now, i have no files to work on so i'm falling asleep here.  maybe it's cuz i've had such a goofy eating schedule these days (read: barely eating anything at all).  mmmm...i want grape popsicles.  speaking of exercise, for some reason my right shoulder has been getting really stiff just after i finish working out.  i stretch well and everything, so i know that's not the problem...and i'm not overexerting myself either...and the gym owner says my form is great so i know i'm not using the machines incorrectly.  it's so bizarre.  i called my massage therapist cousin and she recommended pressing down on a pressure point to try to loosen up...so haha, every so often i'll have random people do just that.

anyway, cynthia and julie leave in 10 days.  man, i can't believe i just said that.  10 days.  LEAVING.  and of course it's not a permanent goodbye or anything, but it's still really rough when it seems like i'm losing people left and right these days and there goes two of my closest friends.  but i know they'll both be happy, and that makes me happy.  here's hoping we make one last karaoke night before they have to leave.  we've even got our songs and stuff all picked out (bada's ""a day of renew"" and s.e.s' ""nuhreul saranghae"").  cynthia also wants to try s' ""i swear"" cuz she heard me singing it the other day...that would actually be really interesting...a bunch of girls singing a song for guys.

christmas in a week, to which i have only one thing to say: BAH HUMBUG. =P  i finally shipped all my friends' packages (you people should be getting them on monday or tuesday), now i just have to buy for my family.  they're so freakin picky and hard to shop for.  i bought a box of cards to send to people who aren't getting gifts from me, but man, i dunno if i'm going to get them written in time.  one thing i actually *did* accomplish was completing my resume, cover letter and clips to send to the sports editor at the union-tribune.  my boss is going to look them over tomorrow, and hopefully i'll send the stuff out on saturday.  i think i'm going to send it express mail...i know it's way expensive, but 1) it'll get there way sooner, and 2) it'll show them i really am interested.  if all goes well, i'll be flying down to san diego in january to meet with them in person.  and i don't want to jinx my chances, so that's all i'll say right now."

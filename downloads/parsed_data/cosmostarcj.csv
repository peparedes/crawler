i woke up this morning with the most pain in my neck i've ever felt in my life. excruciating pain. like i could not move any which way without it hurting, and just sitting here it hurts. so mom took me to the chiropratic office and it turns out i have a really big pinched nerve. 

so NOW besides the fact that I'M ON CRUTCHES. i'm also suppose to wear a NECK BRACE!!!!!!!


i walked into the house with the neck brace on and mike looked at me. and fell on the ground laughing. and yea it was hilarious. i mean if you can picture that. CJ, on crutches and a neck brace. atleast i don't have braces!? man. ooooooooooooh man. hahahahahhahahahahaha.

and the even greater thing is i didn't really even DO anything! haaaaaahahahahaha. oh man. i mean i am going to be scared to go to bed tonight.

i really don't wear the brace though. it doesn't really help."

"event","so today was the last day ever of Mrs. Reynolds hell hole.
and sadly photography. i'm going to miss ms. Isaac soo much its unbelievable. 

BUTTTTTTTTTT theres this huge (41x47 huge) poster of this painting by Jim Dine from the Museum of Modern Art, New York. a huge heart with green background. i have stared at it every day in her class obsessed with it. and today when i was hanging out at her desk i asked her where she got it because i really wanted one like it. and shes like ""ooh the old teacher left it... do you want it?"".... ARE YOU JOKING ME!? OF COURSE!!!! i now am the proud owner of a print of an amazing painting and its like humongo! i seriously was like shaking in disbelief. what a loser. but now its mine and i'm like the happiest little kid.

i also accidentally stapled my finger in Reynolds class trying to open up a stapler. i thought i was too cool to do that... but its an easier thing to do than it looks. i then dislodged it and began to bleed. i guess you take the good with the bad.

2 down. 4 to go... even though all i did was take a vocabulary test, and thursday i have a math final, which i can get a 38% on and have a B in the class. what a waste of day. oh well."

with 2.... count them 2 encores!! the encore alone could have satisfied me. they played for an hour and a half. closing with ""close to me"" ""ten minutes"" ""i`ll catch you"" ""shorty"" and like every awesomest song ever!

(i'm using way to many exclamation marks)

 and wow i still am just blown away (3 days later!!) and then i drove home all by myself from the city at like 1 in the morning.

then i decided i was going to get really tired the next day at school so i stopped by safeway and got a redbull... that was an awkward situation.

what a way to go out.

and this post is basically the same as Laurens... but i mean its all true! and thanks so much for taking me sister! because if it weren't for you i couldn't have seen it.. and it was the best ever! i love you!!"

basically instead of reviewing USEFUL vocab and grammar. we go over AFRICAN FABLES from like ancient times. and we are tested on french history crap that i don't even know in english. i WANT to learn french. and how to not speak like an idiot. but that class doesn't offer me that opportunity.

it actually was a really nice ceremony. i guess it was one of my favorites so far. i guess because i didn't exactly know Jay, and i was only there to support Kate. i was able to hear what people thought of him without ever meeting the guy. he seemed pretty awesome. that's what rocks about memorial services, you get to reminisce on how awesome of a person they were. and they didn't want this to be called a funeral, or memorial service. but rather it was ""a celebration of the life of Jay Swee"". i want mine to be like that, and everyone to wear my favorite color. because i dont want people to be sad. because i'm off to a better place.


i'm in a bitter sweet mood right now.

he called me. never fails. every night. atleast twice.

i dont want to be cynical in this post, even though its not like a super happy one, whatever its mellow. but a cronic headache for like 3 days, not my average headache. i've never felt this one before. and i've definitely tried every pill. oh and that reminds me i have to take my amoxacillin (sp???) 

ben? no more i guess. i think he realized it wasn't floating my boat. frosting my cupcake. tying my shoe. matty said so. but matty was weird tonite. ben was good acoustic but crappy plugged in. its not his fault he couldnt hear himself. but if the guitar was turned down it would have been sweet.


i should have been alone in the parking lot at one point in time."

"event","i'm infatuated with him. i don't know why. i haven't felt this way about a boy in a long time. and at the same time i hate him.

he gives off the weirdest signals. every person i talk to about it has mixed feelings and can't give me any good advice. i get polar opposite responses because hes insane. hes truely one of a kind. playing with my heart and head. and i am going to kill him. one minute hes being the sweetest guy in the world. the next minute hes ignoring me. he called last night, we talked for 4 and a half hours, he then texted me after we hung up, he texted me when i woke up, and in every single class today we were texting... what is this? he goes out of his way to be near me, talk to me, tickle me, make me laugh. then he makes fun of me, ignores me, tries to make me jealous.

 WHAT IS THIS? CAN YOU PLEASE JUST MAKE UP YOUR MIND PLEASE!?!?!

all i want is an answer. to define what it is that we have. do you just want to be friends? do you dispise me? do you like me but don't want to go out? do you want to be my boyfriend? will you PLEASE just tell me whats going on in that insane head of yours.

i thought after the trip it would be easier for me to just forget about things and let things fly since i wouldn't see you every waking moment. but you won't even leave me alone here. you text me, millions of times. you call me. leave me alone or do something about this. this isn't fair to be doing this to me. every one is talking about it. you MUST know that i like you. so why are you putting me through hell? why do i even like you in the first place??

i hate that i can't go by one minute without thinking about what you are doing. how i wish you would just call me or text me. how when i completely forget about you for one moment you appear out of no where.  will some one please put me out of this bitter-sweet misery??"

"event","so i basically had an awesome night. except the last part. which is why i`m sitting here at my computer at 10:32.

so i drove like mad today, dropping crap off, buying stuff, going out to lunch with people, going to coffee with people (vanilla latte with six packs of sugar!? = wired). and then i helped pack the vans. or rather sit around and not. but it was cool. and then he and i sat in my car reclined for a while talking and what not.

i'm so distracted by the movie Ray right now. too bad i walked in in the middle of it. looks good so far.

so then like matty called like 3 times saying that i should go to carolyns house tonite to see ben and all them. and earlier lori and john had both told me that too. so matty called like 2 hours ago and said they would be at her house in like a half hour and told me how to get there. i leave like an hour later. go to where they tell me. on the way i call matty like 5 times, lori 3 times, john 2 times, matt onces. (i sound like a stalker) but i mean they were the ones who were like ""oh come hang out blah blah blah"" basically. it ended because no one answers their phone and ditches me. yessssssssss. and so i came home.

so altogether now. THANKS GUYS! and HAVE A HAPPY BREAK YOURSELF. crackers. see you in a week."

"event","so the boys want to hook me and ben up. hes cool yes. awesome actually. but i kinda got a little annoyed. i dunno if that was my guard trying to fool myself into not liking him. or if that was just the case. but i talked to him yesterday and he invited me to come over on friday. tomorrow? i said yea. but i don't know if it will work out.

Lori called me when i was at Gregs house like 2 nights ago and was like ""OH MY GOSH I TALKED TO MATTY AND HE TALKED TO BEN AND BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH"" and he knew they were trying to set us up. very obveous to say the least. i mean i guess its cool whatever. but can we please not make this a 6th grade romance where everyone is in on it but us?

leaving for mexico with the boys on saturday. i hope it turns out good. and happy. and i love everyone.

i bombed like um... 3 tests today! yea. i dont care. the good part is that its over. and i totally aced my book report thing. yea."

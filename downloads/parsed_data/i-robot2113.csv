Swirling sweetly in the evening
She is the stars glowing gorgeously
She is the sloping clouds

Forever scrolling
Unfolding

She is the sun burned blue and shadows on the moon
She is the morning dew
Dangling on leaves leaking into streams

Forever flowing
Unfolding
No one can say her name

Now she sits and sings something about my dreams
Hours go by before she looks at me
She breaks my heart
As I open my eyes to drink the melon sky"

there lies the vaudeville where creatures are gathering.
The assembly
cackle and drool at a land slowly dying.
The monologue begins.
The man is abandoned.
And he cracks a lonely smile
like an oyster that's been shucked and dead.
The company the red
posies they sprang and they whispered.

Sweet tragedy.

""There's a bird who is broken down.
She hunts the soil so her young can feed.
But the morning never stays for long
and the flock will starve for needs.""
This is the act you see,
our seeds were sown in fertile soil.
And the crowd all cheered as the men as beasts
destroyed the crop and field.

Sweet tragedy.

The ensemble's tune of wretched abandon.
Where desperate souls
They litter the pavement.
Where beasts roam the world
in arrogant fashion.
Trampling the harvest and spoiling the soil."

you should grant me this one wish.
Like the one year of my life that I gave to you and
now you put me through hell.
You break me up.
I should hate you, but I can't replace you in my heart.
Why am I so pathetic?
I don't get it why you won't return my calls.
Can't you look at me once?
And please if you got a minute,
enjoy this lonely sky with me.
It'll swallow us whole if we only let it.

and lying on hills with wet grass below and blue black above- 
I will carry all the weights tonight 
'cause I keep remembering the day that you said you might go crazy 
if you spent one more minute with me and I just don't know- 
is one more minute going to kill you now? 
Stop before I say too much- 
so now I've been alone and it's been going but tomorrow might not come 
if I don't let it so don't forget the mornings that we spent deep inside out heads 
staring at blank walls 'cause that's what counts 
and I don't know but I'm trying to let you go 
but I can't cut so well these strings I have around my neck 
and I'm trying to let you know that I'm doing this by myself- 
so don't forget we sent letters to ourselves without words 
and it was just to remember those days that we spent in our heads

all I have are the empty boxes to carry away your heart

and I'll sing songs and wake you up 
and I'll take you blindfolded dancing onto bridges 
and you'll say you don't to be with me 
'cause no one ever does and no one ever thinks of me that way

we watched documentaries up through morning and then you kicked me out. 
You opened up your screen door and threw me off the porch. 
It was summer then and I drove home whistling muddy waters down the pike. 
And that was that: our one sweet night together. 
Under highway signs I watched our love start fluttering and dissipating. 
I counted all the headlights to make sure I was all right. 
Now I'm wondering is it me or is it me that can't see silver linings? 
So I fucked it up. I watched you go.
I saw my hand not dialing the phone. 
All I'm left to do is remember the dull room we sat in blue stream 
light watching the strike of '59. 
I dreamed of wrecking my underwear. 
Oh can't I touch your cheeks somewhere 
under dirt filled rainy nights with my socks stuck in the mud? 
Please come dive in puddles with me.

I saw the structured grid and pavement cutting through grass 
and I remembered the cold of winter running up the legs of my pants. 
I picked the nicest lawn and imagined the two of us 
rolling around down along the ground. 
I saw myself touch your face and I noticed jets begin to race above our heads. 
But I pinched my arm and remembered how much you hate me. 
I remembered the fact that I can't see what you need 
and I'm too stupid to be aware of the beauty that you give this place 
and how shitty this town would seem without you in it. 
When you aren't around I let the shades fall down to shut out

friday we had our science midterm and the procter there hated me, as soon as i walked in the flames were in her eyes and i was in for trouble. first i finish my test and everyday this week i've finished and listened to my ipod, and i take out my ipod and she looks at it and goes nope sory you cant listen to that, meanwhile there were other kids listening and i said why not? she said because it might be too loud and people can hear it, so i said but theres volume controle she said no just put it away

then this kid ryans phone went off and three people were talking to him and i said hey ryan you should try not to make your phone go off and she singles me out and sais you should try not to talk


yea then friday night we went to emac and bolies (ice cream store) and had ice cream and watched acoustic bands play, chris got the best sundae with vanilla ice cream, hotfudge m and m's and WHIPED CREAM


so today was just a blur, i woke up and had reeses for breakfeast......

well christmas was good i guess, nobody knew wut to get me so i got 90 dollars in fye gift cards and 75 in pac sun, napolean dynamite on dvd and a nwe high hat and high hat stand, then i dun even remember half teh stuff i did this break, i went to steve g's house and played halo 2 with steve squared and chris but that didnt end up too good

yesterday was the most exciting morning of the break, ill tell wut i did, i woke up....then i was hungry and instead of pouring a bowl of cerial i decided to go crazy and i made myself eggs and toast, i skated over to chris englers house because he had one of my controllers and then i fixed my grandmas dvd player

than i decided to go over to my good friend justin veatches house and we recorded a little bit and just were being retarded cuz we are well atleast he is

then i went to sarahs house last night...it was fun i guess and i accidentally broke her carona magnet but instead of fixing it she came up with the good idea of just puting the broken thing on the fridge so the next person that opens it will think they broke it, then we were gonna go to starbucks but victoria couldnt go and then when we all got there it was closed so we went to seven eleven and bought slurpies with her five dollars

today has been reallly slow so far, i dont feel too good,sore throat tired always thirsty, the works, alka seltzer always works good i guess, 

things have been better lately, i still feel like somthings missing tho, i duno wut it is tho... i have the coolest dreams ever i had this dream this week that there was a giant fifty foot snake terrorising new york city and like a million people died but when they finally killed it everybody crossed the bridge and donated there left shoe to all the people that were victims than i walked to the other side of the bridge i said i donated my shoe, and some random person said o the one with the hole in it? and my shoe really did have a hole in it wich was kinda weird

and some other dreams that i dont wanna say because their either too long to explain or personal ... ha personal i crack mysefl up"

i got oatmeal cookies that kicked ass from spiz

my dad already showed me what he was getting me and i can tell christmas is gonna be bad at my house cuz the only thing we really wanted was a dog, and my dad almost did buy it, but then he ended up buying my sister a shitty present that she doesnt want and i can sorta tell its gonna suck

chris was over today and we played video games with jack that was fun, today was one of the better days, in italian mrs lapunzina was singing songs and dancing wich was really scary but i got horny anyway so its all good.

"event","I have to know: is it you I'm seeking? This feeling's strong, and it comes as it... 

Please don't leave this in my hands. 'Cause I know love sometimes is feast or famine. No one gets this far by speaking tongues or bending backwards. 

Love like there's no tomorrow. Live under novacaine. Andything hard to swallow gets iced or numbed and swept under the rug. 

And if I made it this far, I'll make it all the way. I'll drown under the Hudson, sleep under these stars. 

This marks the end. Just say the word and I'll be gone by morning. I call your bluff, and you call mine and find we've both been faking. 

Don't let it get this far. She spoke and I was brought back to my senses. No, no one gets this far by speaking tongues or bending backwards. 

Love like there's no tomorrow. Live under novacaine. Anything hard to swallow gets iced or numbed and swept under the rug. 

And if I made it this far, I'll make it all the way. I'll sleep under the Hudson, drown under these stars. 

And though we try. Still it's never enough. 

(Year one the hours measured in sighs, your eyes see only mine. Year three the fights get worse but we've grown frightened to be alone.)"

"event","It's funny how you hear the old saying, ""if you talk to fondly about it, you're gonna jinx it""...  Well this is exactly what I did with my newest relationship.  I talked about it so much and doted on my new winner of a boyfriend, that I jinxed it.  No actually, I killed it.  My dream romance, that is.  Rather, I may have scared him off with my overly loving ways.  In looking back, I totally broke all the cardinal rules in the ""how to loose a guy in ten days"" rule book.  Yes, I was clingy and overly loving and dreamy.  I probably made him want to puke with all my sentiment.  Ha-ha!  Lessons lived and learned.  Now on to my next victim!  LOL!"

I am still living with my husband, in separate rooms &amp;&nbsp;beds...as roommates.&nbsp; It's the best we can do at this point.&nbsp; All went south shortly after my last post.&nbsp; I saw it coming. &nbsp;There had been some really bad times over the years, but after he started this job, I&nbsp;was certain we were doomed.&nbsp; Opposite schedules do not work for me in a relationship.&nbsp; I crave too much attention.&nbsp; Also, I don't trust him.&nbsp; Haven't since I&nbsp;was pregnant.&nbsp; Can't get over it.&nbsp; Just accepting it.&nbsp; Now, we just try to get along as best we can, since we're pretty much stuck here for now.&nbsp; We have a child in common, that we both love dearly, and can't bear to be without full time.&nbsp; So, we trudge on.

My job has been so busy and stressful, that even working part-time wears me out, mentally.&nbsp; And then, there's coming home.

The oldest son is going to be 15 in a week and a half.&nbsp; The attitude changes in him, as the hormones rage, have us all raging.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think about him driving and I&nbsp;am filled with trepidation.&nbsp; Then again, if he gets good at it, he can tote himself around.&nbsp; I try to look on the bright side.&nbsp; He really is a good boy at heart.&nbsp; Better than most his age, for certain, in the heart department.

Youngest is more amazing than ever.&nbsp; He is so full of energy and ideas.&nbsp; The past year or so, he's written/drawn at least 20 graphic novels.&nbsp; I hope this creative streak continues to grow and grow.&nbsp; We encourage him.&nbsp; He is a machine.

Creativity seems to elude me, of late.&nbsp; A serious case of the writer's block.&nbsp; Sucks, man.

My side of the family is rough.&nbsp; Past issues being drudged up out of the ether, not doing a lot for my concentration and creativity.&nbsp; But, alas, these are only excuses.

I&nbsp;never did clean my colon all those years ago.&nbsp; Why the hell bother?&nbsp; Life is a big colon, a lot of the time.

Enough negativity.&nbsp; Must press on.&nbsp; Plus, I have pizzas in the oven...."

"event","Well, what a coincidence that I haven't posted or even checked livejournal forever, I get on and check superfreak's and she just posted yesterday.

The last three days of this week have been somewhat more calm at my new job, since the rep was in New York.

My kids seem to be okay with their new schools.  I don't know much about how my husband is liking his new job, since I have barely seen him since he started this week.  I will be glad when he's off 2nd shift.  That shift totally sucks for married people - especially ones with kids.  It is almost like being a single parent....or having a ghost parent who comes in while you're asleep to check the bookbag.  I really thought the cat would be more freaked out by having someone home almost all the time with husband home until around 2:30, Zach getting home at 3:30, and me and Vince home at 5:30, but she doesn't seem to be bothered too much.  She gets a whopping hour to herself now.  More than I get.  Still, when you're used to about 10 hours a day alone, it's got to be a shocker.  Poor cat.  She's getting old.  She just lays about most of the time...and she pukes more than she used to.  I had a dream about a week ago that we got a new kitten, but we still had the old cat.  Hope that's not a premonition.  I don't want a kitten right now, on top of all the other stuff I have going on.

My son is 12.  He went to his first school dance this afternoon.  He didn't really enjoy it as much as I hoped he would.  Once he makes more friends, I believe he'll enjoy those opportunities for socializing a little more.  I was surprised at how streamlined the pickup line was at the school.  It moved right along.  Only took half an hour to pick him up.

Well, I haven't got my new insurance cards yet, so I had to pay full price for one of my prescriptions yesterday.  It was almost $64.  This is one I have to take daily.  There are two like that.  The generic for the other one is $27 without insurance.  This is why it's so important for me to have insurance.  I guess a stroke, heart attack or kidney failure would be more expensive than the drugs, though.

Don't you wish you were me?"

3.  My toenails are too long and I'm not doing anything about it right now.

4.  The gums on my top front teeth are receding.

5.  I need to color my hair because there are gray antennia all over my head, but I'm not doing anything about it right now.

6.  My 4-yr-old got his immunizations today and didn't bat an eyelash or cry at all.  I was all freaked out about him getting shots, and now I'm freaked out because he didn't freak out.

7.  For the longest time, I resisted Larry the Cable Guy; but I finally caved.  I like him now.

8.  I want Antonio Banderas to read me stories at night before I go to bed - and to teach me how to dance.  I wear his signature perfume.

9.  Around these parts, people spread manure for fertilizer and it stinks REALLY bad.

10.  My 4-yr-old just called his dad ""retacular"".  I guess that's a combination of retarded and spectacular.

11.  I love the Movies ""Kill Bill"" and ""Kill Bill 2"" - and I love the song Bang, Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down).

12.  The other day, I realized I have lost my Joe Satriani CD's.

13.  I also want Anthony Hopkins to read me stories before I go to bed, and to teach me how to be a cool customer.

14.  I love the sound of Cicadas on a balmy evening.

15.  I love trees and mermaids.

16.  I once worked for Leona Helmsley, and yes, she IS a bitch.  I talked to her on the phone one day and she was a bitch.

17.  For a short time, I worked for a jewish real estate attorney, and he was a prick and a half.

18.  I can burp REALLY loud like a guy, and like to say words when I'm doing it.  I don't do this in front of everyone, though.

20.  Surprisingly, I have very few stretchmarks from childbearing.

21.  I have acne and oily skin like a teenager.

23.  I am curious about what will happen to my soul aftr I die, as I've no preconceived notions about it.

24.  I think Dusty Springfield used to be a man....not that there's anything wrong with that.

25.  I like to use fake accents, and once did it as I was pretending to talk on a payphone while a cute guy was walking by (I was in college).

26.  I had a gay (man) roommate one time and he was a total pain in the ass - no pun intended.

27.  I always had a weakness for tall men, and my current husband is of average height.  I guess I got tired of being weak.

28.  My ears are very rarely waxy.

29.  I look too much like my mother.

30.  I love pickled beets.

That's enough for now."

Today was a little better.  Sometimes in life bad things happen to teach us lessons.  The lesson I learned yesterday was:  KEEP YOUR DAGUM MOUTH SHUT.  The enemy is out there if you view it like that.  But really, it is a lesson waiting for those who are too stubborn and self-centered to recognize normal lessons in everyday life.  I am no dummy (I'm actually a marionette - hahahaha!), but I am a bit thick in the I'm-only-human department.  I tend to forget my faults and run with them, no matter how they bog me down.  I actually lost a pound yesterday.  Perhaps life's lessons are good for more than the lessons intended.  If they could actually be marketed as weight control I would be a rich woman.

Yesterday, for a little while, I had a terrible feeling of dread.  That happens to me every now and then.  But, as far as I know, nothing was going on.  Just me being hormonal.

I finished reading ""Life After Death The Burden of Proof"" by Depak Chopra, this weekend.  It was goooooood - if you can stand the scientific talk.  I was reading it - totally into it - when I suddenly thought, ""You could recommend this book to someone, but not everyone enjoys reading this type of thing; to them it would be like reading a text book, but to me it is totally fascinating.""  It's things like this that make me wish I were better at math.

I got about 2 1/2 hours of sleep last night, but I'm going to get outside and exercise if it kills me.  I'm never going to improve my health if I sit on my butt at the computer all day long.

Hubby is working today.  I heard the alarm go off in the living room at about 5:40a.m.  I'm glad I don't have that job.  It's bad enough having to get up prior to the crack of dawn 5 days a week."

The workday was hectic and very productive, though.  My new partner said he'd had the best month production-wise that he's had in all his years of business, largely due to the area I work in.  That made me feel good.  However, it didn't really excite me all that much, and he was disappointed with my reaction.  I don't get excited too easily.

I got home and it took my husband forever to come in the house.  I was actually getting worried when he didn't show up with our young son.  I found out he was talking on the cell phone in the car.  Then I found out one of our son's classmates threw up and my husband wasn't feeling too good, either.  Then I found out that our young son isn't feeling to good.  Great.

"event","My father is not a religious man.  At times in my life, I've been less than happy that he didn't attend church with us as kids.  At other times, I've wondered what would happen to his eternal soul.  These were thoughts I had prior to about ten years ago, when I began my own soul searching and discovered what MY beliefs were - not those of any church or state.  I don't recall, however, being actually glad that my dad wasn't religious - until this evening.

An excerpt from a book that I was reading was a young woman's memory of her father's rejection after she had an abortion.  Toward the end of my ""at-home"" days - a little more than a year before I finally cut the cord - I had a similar experience with my dad.  In April of 1989, I became pregnant - illegitimately so, and undesirably so.  I was unemployed at the time, having walked out on a $5.50/hr. position as a phone order taker/classified ad typesetter/magazine mailer/credit card transaction processor, etc. at a car club.  I learned a lot at the job, but the pay wasn't worth what I had to do or the drive to get there and back.  I met some nice people, none of whom I still keep in touch with.  I partied a lot in those days - mostly with my cousins.  It was at a cousin's party that I met the person who happened to have the energetic spermatozoa that found it's way through the birth control I was on to the egg which said birth control had failed to prevent doing what it did.  Well, the day I finally got another job was the first day after I found out for sure I was indeed pregnant.  I knew immediately what I would do - but like the ignoramus I was, thinking my mom would ""be there"" for me, I told her.  And she told dad.  And dad did not speak to me or look at me or want to be in the same room with me for at least two weeks.  Mom kept trying to talk me into having an unwanted baby, that I was pretty sure would have some serious problems due to all my partying while pregnant - she wanted me to go through with a pregnancy, have a child and then give it up for adoption.  How could I break my own selfish heart that way?  How could I do that?  I knew if I had the baby, I would have to keep it, no matter what condition it was in.  No way.  Well, I was sick, sick, sick.  And worse, I was ashamed.  I was tortured, because, at that time, I still believed in sin the same way I always had.  So, I had a big talk with ""God"" and I came to a peace about my decision.  I heard ""God"" say to me in my mind that I was forgiven, in advance.  Meanwhile, I was grieving the loss of a relationship I'd never had, and was sure I would now certainly never have with my father, who was now more distant than ever before.  I decided I would move in with a friend so he wouldn't have to be with me, and I wouldn't have to deal with the disdain I felt from him.  I guess he overheard me telling my mom this, because he called me into the family room to have a talk with me.  He flatly told me that he was upset, but he would get over it.  He didn't want me to move out because of his reaction.  He then told me the one thing that made me know for sure he cared for me.  He said, ""Whatever you decide to do, this is your decision and you will have to live with it.  You are not going to be able to blame anyone else, including me.  I can't tell you what to do.""  The day I had my abortion, my family was in Georgia, at my cousin's wedding.  My dad called me that afternoon to check on me and make sure I was alright.  And not until today was I ever truly thankful that my dad was not ""religious"".  How bizarre."

"event","I'm home today due the the Presidents' Day Holiday.  I hate to get up and drink water, water, water, instead of my normal coffee - which almost made me barf.  Took a shower and then took my tranquilizer to prevent me from freaking out at having needles stuck into me repeatedly, since they can never find a good vein.  I kissed my kids goodbye as they were on the way out the door with my husband.  It was a bitter sweet kiss goodbye to my oldest boy.  He's only here on weekends now, and fights and antagonizes his brother, argues with me over everything and doesn't do what he's told immediately, like my drill sargent self wants him to.  Last night after his shower, he came to sit beside me on the couch after the little one went to bed.  It was a tender and sad moment; finally being able to give him some love after having been angry with him 90% of the weekend.  When will this end?  I hope it won't get to the point where there are no tender moments, be they sweet, sour, bitter or otherwise.  I hope he doesn't end up like I was as a teen; loathing my parents so much that I just wanted to be away from them all the time.

I was very ashamed of myself for not exercising this weekend - even though it was very cold outside and I had a house full of lazy people annoying me with their sloppiness.  I can never completely relax, and I can never completely get motivated to move.  I feel like a walking contradiction.  I feel guilty for not yet taking the kids to visit my parents.  But, when I talked to mom yesterday she was telling me how she has the heat set on 65 and it hasn't been over 57 degrees in their house all weekend.  I can't take my kids to stay in a place so cold when my little one won't stay covered up.  I tried to tell mom they need to crank the heat up a little.  But you just can't tell someone who doesn't listen anything at all.

I am sick of being poor.  I'm tired of being ignored.  I told my husband 8 months ago to quit using the gas card he cranked up an almost $7000 balance on when he was in sales and having to use his own car and gas for without being able to expense it.  I hate that when I look at the monthly activity on that card, it shows $2-$7 purchases at McDonald's, KFC and convenience stores - obviously from food purchases.  He's not buying furniture or paying for auto repairs or even taking me out to nice dinners or weekends away together.  I hate having to tell him what to do.  He is my man and I should feel safe and secure with him, and not like the boss that has to nag all the time.  I think he finally cut up the card the other night.  Does everyone in my life have A.D.D.?  Or does everyone in my life hate me so much that they are being passive aggressive in retribution?

It's 1:30pm, and I've done nothing but sit and play on the computer and listen to cd's.  I did empty the dishwasher, but I haven't reloaded it.  My mellowness is comforting, but too much that I can take the tranq's to walk around in society without appearing to be one of my flaky customers.

I go to bed at night and worry about things that have nothing to do with me.  Like my new co-worker separating from his spouse and trying to get full custody of his 2 year old daughter.  That bothers me because that little girl will be hurt if he does that.  But what can I do?  I worry about shit that I can't control.  I don't have all the facts, either.  I do know life deals out sad hands here and there and we have to play our way through them.  I am so melancholy most of the time.  I find myself hating people on TV who are always enthusiastic and happy.  I regret sharing feelings about myself and my family with others, because I feel like I put distance between myself and them, and this is why I have no friends.  It may be easier to drink, but what happens to my liver and the livers of my kids in future when they drink because I've put it out as an example.  Shit!"

3.  I like the smell of gasoline.
4.  I separate my m&m's into colors.  Then I eat enough of each color so that all colors either have the same amount or have a common factor.  Then I eat them in clusters containing all colors, so that the colors still have the same amount or common factor.
5.  I have to have all my stuff in the same place all the time, it really upsets me when I leave something somewhere else or if someone borrows my stuff and doesn't put it back in its place.
6.  I weigh myself before each shower - after voiding.
7.  I thought I was close to menopause, until my work partner resigned - after which I had the first normal period in over a year.
8.  I like going to the dentist.
9.  I take a bath almost every night when I get home from work - to unwind and spend some alone time.
10. If I press on my bellybutton when I'm done peeing, it will make me pee more.

"event","My little elf.  He is going to be 5 in June.  Last week my sister and her girlfriend came to visit, and in his quick, little narative voice he began to speak of his rubber lady in the bathtub and how daddy told him to stay away from the hooker in the garage.

Let me explain...

My little elf loves the macabre.  He has several skeleton, witch and monster toys.  Among those is a 7-inch, rubber squishy Bride of Frankenstein that he got one Friday from his daddy for being a good boy all week at daycare.  This toy he has christened ""My Rubber Lady"".  He has great fun with the rubber lady, tying her arms around the shower switch on the bathtub faucet or a tinker toy contraption or anything her arms will encircle, raising a single one of her arms above the bubble bath...  You have to understand the permanent expression the rubber lady sports is a mad scream.  Then of course there's her hair.  When she's tied to the faucet or a tinker toy contraption, she really does appear to be in a great deal of distress.  I find this very amusing.

Also last week, my husband was cleaning out the garage.  There are many old toys out there.  One of those is a toy crane - with a hook - that no longer works.  The little elf was out in the garage and apparently getting frustrated with the crane.  He has a bad temper (mommy's little boy), and I believe this is why daddy told him to leave it alone.  Well, he doesn't know much about cranes, per se.  Especially that they're called ""cranes"" instead of ""hookers"".  Hence the hooker comment.  I find this also very amusing.

I wonder if he talks about the rubber lady in the bathtub and being warned away from hookers in the garage at daycare.  They're a religious lot at daycare.  I find this also very amusing."

"event","Wow, it's been quite a long time since I've posted.  And to think I started this journal just a little over a year ago.  Last year sucked, also, but not quite as bad as 2005.

This year I turned 40 on the 2nd.  I don't feel any different.  Mainly just surprised to have made it this far without croaking or spending any jailtime.

I got some news on Wednesday (today is Friday), that my now EX partner at work was forced to resign.  It's been a hectic couple of days.  Another person is filling in for the time being, and was in the office today.  I was so relieved to discover he actually knows what he's doing.

I made a resolution to make note of beautiful things as often as possible this year.  I've taken one note, and that was about some frost shining in the sun.  The frost happened to be on a piece of cardboard that was on the back of a pickup truck.  I did not let the fact that it was cardboard supported frost ruin the beauty in my mind.

In the summer-time of 2006, I pretty much lost another friend due to her lies and me not being able to tolerate it.  We still talk, but I don't think we'll ever be close.  We weren't super tight anyway.

In the last quarter of 2006, I lost a total of 8 lbs. by lowering my portions and eating healthier.  I exercised a little, too, and then quit, now I have to motivate myself to start again.

In the middle of December, I had a scary bleeding thing related to perimenopausal crap.  I may end up having some surgery.  I don't want to have anymore problems like that.  That sucketh.

I don't know why it is, but most of the people I like the most live far enough away, that I can't just pop over to their house and visit.  Some live in other states, some in other cities.  But there's no one close to home.

My sinuses are messed up.  I did find one thing to be true this year; when I regularly get outside and walk, my sinuses feel better.  There must be something to this ""fresh air"" - even though it's not all that fresh being beside a major highway.

The whole town I work in stinks.  It smells like gasoline and paint chemicals.  As soon as you pull off of the long country road I take to the main roads that lead to the work town, it smells like the inside of a garage where they only work on old, beat up vehicles.

Okay, this is a boring post.  I'm going to go have some hot tea."

"event","Well, I went to the gynecologist yesterday and discovered - big surprise - that I am perimenopausal.  yay.  He prescribed the world's mildest tranquilizers for those ""moments"" when I feel as if I might like to rip someone's head off and roll it down my driveway and then run back and forth over it with the car, and then clear it off the street with a giant firehose, and then go find all the little pieces and grind them into nothingness with the bottom of my althetic shoes - that I don't use for athletics.

I anticipate needing these in a big way.  Especially since my day began with trouble and has continued that way throughout - aside from the time I took my 4-yr-old to the eye doctor to have his eyes checked.  That was actually pretty fun.  My kid was true to form silly - even burped and farted - but politely said, ""excuse me"" afterword.  The doctor was shining that bright light into his eyes and trying to get him to sit still and count, but my son had his own agenda.  He kept saying, ""Put a different picture up there, I'm tired of this picture.""  And, ""I'm tired of this thing, now, let's do something else.""  At one point, my kid says, ""I'm warning you..""  When the exam was over, he told the doctor, ""Now it's YOUR turn.  Get up there!""  The doctor got up in the chair and tried to show my son how to make it go up and down.  It wasn't working too well, and I decided to end the appointment before things got ugly.  But, the good news is he has 20/25 vision, a little farsighted, but that is good.  No need for correction at all.

My older son began taking his ADD med on Saturday and now his dad and I have decided to take him off of it.  The side effects are just unacceptable.  They make him sick, ruin his appetite, make his heart race and make him depressed and have anxiety.  It just takes his spirit away.  I can't handle that.  I'm hoping we can make it through the school year without medication."

I think it was last summer this time when they came that she had pissed me off within 5 mins of being here.  Basically, you have to treat her like she treats you - it's all she understands.  Why?  I don't know.  She obviously has no concept of the real world.  The average adult doesn't take naps every single afternoon, anymore.  She has always done this.  I've never known her to go an entire day in the last 39+ years without taking a nap in the afternoon.  Most grown women worth their salt do not watch soap operas and try to act like the people in soap operas with their attitudes.  Most people don't come into someone else's house as a guest and presume to try and boss everyone around.  She's lucky to be alive.  I've come to blows with her.  I've banned her from my house.  I've shunned her for months for gossiping about me.  No wonder my dad stays outside all day.  I don't think her mom treated her that way, and I know her mother-in-law didn't.  She's just a beeahhhtch sometimes.  Just when I start getting along with her, she does something to piss me off again.  And the worst thing about it all is that I have her genes.  I find myself acting like her sometimes.  GAWD!

"event","Wow, my allergies are like totally peaking, man.

Been working harder, lately.  Also studying for a re-test.

Kids are ok.  Oldest had a sinus infection, youngest had a tummy bug.  But all is well now.

I woke up at 6:30am and studied for about an hour, before I was compelled to get up and make breakfast for the little one.  Since then, I've been doing laundry, dishes, playing Sims2, and catching up on emails, myspace & livejournal.  I only do this about once a week now since I don't get anything usually too urgent in the email.

It finally rained the past couple of nights.  We really needed it.  I've discovered that if you go out and spend your water dollars to water your lawn or plants, then it will rain.

My husband found a baby bunny a week ago and brought it home.  It only lived a few days.  I think it was just too young to be away from it's mommy.  It was only about the size of a gerbil.  It wouldn't drink anything at all, and it only ate a grape and some clover flowers.  It was also extremely hot last Monday, and even though we had it in a shadey spot outside, it still passed away.  Poor little bunny!!  My husband needs to stop bringing animals home."

BEER BREAD

3 cups self-rising flour
3 tablespoons sugar
12 oz. beer
4 tablespoons melted butter

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Mix first 3 ingredients in a large bowl.  Grease a large loaf pan with Crisco.  Pour batter into loaf pan.  Bake 50 minutes.  Remove from oven and pour melted butter over the top of the bread.  Bake an additional 10 minutes, remove from oven and turn oven off (some people forget to do that).

This is a heavy textured, slightly sweet bread.  Very yummy!

Now I have these extra beers.  I'm drinking one now (at 11:00 a.m., on a Tuesday)."

"event","Since I seem to only be able to find anything to say about once a month anymore, here it is....

Job has continued to suck.  So badly, lately, that I am having back pain in the afternoon due to tension.  No matter how hard I work, trying to be productive or distracted from not being productive, there is no substituting actual money-producing work.  It just can't be replaced as a source of satisfaction in my job.  And certainly, no amount of listening to customers bitching is going to make me happy, when I'm not the problem and they refuse to bitch to the source of their problems.  Sooooooooo, I decided to bitch to our boss about the problem.  I came to discover in doing this that it is now my job to provide 20 names for the boss to provide to the recruiting person.  My partner is most likely going to go away pretty soon, especially if he doesn't pick up his numbers.  This is all fine, but for the fact that I don't KNOW anybody in their right mind who I could call on that would want to leave their jobs at a place that is perfectly streamlined to come and work in the utter chaos that is our company.  Dilema.  So, I am like a dog running around in circles, only dogs seem to enjoy this activity.  It is just a waste of time for me.

Home is okay.  I finally bitched enough at the furniture company that they decided to complete my order of six months ago.

I did our taxes on Sunday, and discovered we are getting back enough to pay off a tiny portion of our debt.  This is a good thing.

The book I ordered for my mother a month ago still hasn't arrived at her house.  I am going to quit ordering things.

The dingbat that I was good friends with for a couple of years and fell out of my good graces because she is a big fat liar is going away.  Her last day at work is Wednesday.  They came around taking up money to buy her a gift.  I waived them off saying, ""I'm not even going to say goodbye.""  I feel like standing at the door after she walks out tomorrow and saying, ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAnd STAY OUT!!""  She is supposedly moving to Jamaica and not going to have to work - living with a guy she has known for a whopping two months.  I don't believe a damn thing she says - and please note that she didn't say any of this crap to me at all.  Probably because when I confronted her with the lies a few months ago, I told her, ""You can tell me anything at all, no matter what it is, and I will still be your friend - AS LONG AS IT IS THE TRUTH.""  At that point is when she stopped telling me anything.  Which tells me that everything that comes from her mouth is an utter farce.  This going away of her will keep me from happening upon her in a dark alley some evening unexpectedly and having to kick the living shit out of her.  So this is a good thing.

Eventually, all things bad go away.

I haven't spoken to anybody for a while, maybe a week or so.  I just don't have anything good to say, so I try not to bother anybody.  Also, our power went off last week, and since then, I've had a different phone plugged in that I can barely hear, so it's possibly someone has tried to call me and I've not been aware of it.

My health is about the same.  I started to get worried there for a week or so because of my back pain, but I think it's just tension.  I've been taking ibuprofen at night and Benedryl so I can sleep.  It's working.  I'm sleeping, and actually woke up feeling half-decent this morning for a change.  That is rare.  I hate to think I have to take things to sleep, but the alternative is feeling like crap every day.  And besides, it's not morphine or oxycodone - it's ibuprofen and benedryl.  It also seems to be helping my seasonal allergies.  The problem with sleeping so well is that I don't remember my dreams as well.  But, the general feeling I get when I wake up is that the dreams were good.

I wrote a thought down at my blog www.universalmnd.blogspot.com the other day.  I have a certain kinship to trees.

I have given up on trying to ""fit in.""  I have decided that this particular reality doesn't sell anything that fits me, and even if it does, it's not my style.  I'm at that age where I'm not real obsessed with my looks anymore - not trying to attract a mate or anything.  Sortof want to be left alone and reclusive, but at the same time I long to have my young energy back so that I can play and get things done - and smile.

I get proud when my kids do neat things.  At some point, I hope that I can focus on them like I need to.  I feel a need to be close to family, but so akward around everyone because I've been out of the loop so long.  The little one has been pretty good at daycare lately; hasn't bit anyone or tried to choke anyone in the last week or so.  The big one has been doing well in school and behaving well enough to get his gameboy privileges back.  If we go a week with these things happening, we are doing great.  Neither of them has peed on the floor in a while.

My husband has been behaving nicely, too.  He's pretty well-behaved, generally.  He's actually very well behaved as far as men go.

I've been behaving somewhat decently.  I haven't had to spank anyone in a while or get super mad.  That might be because I'm coping with it by having back pain.

I plucked my eyebrows the other day, too.  That is a major deal.  I have a lot of eyebrows.  I don't know why.  I guess it would be easier to go and have them ripped off at a beauty shop, but that would require actual effort on my part to make myself presentable before going anywhere.  I'd rather pluck them out in the privacy of my own home.  Besides, what do they DO with your eyebrows at those places?  They could be performing DNA experiments.  I'd hate to see a clone of me at some point in the future who actually had kept her figure and had a great job and all that energy.  They could be selling my eyebrows to Bush.....making clones to send overseas to fight our wars.  Well, you're not getting MY genes, George.  Send your own pale clones into oblivion."

"event","These past few days have been pretty sucky.  And I haven't even been at work!  Saturday, I flunked my test.  The last test I would have had to take for at least a long time.  Well, that wasn't so bad, really.  I got to stay at a quiet place and watch All in the Family, Sanford and Son and Coach reruns as I was taking a bath, going to bed and waking up.  If you ever need to spend the night in Greensboro, NC, and are not fond of being kept up by rude hotel guests, you should check out the Residence Inn by Marriott.  That's the second time I've stayed there, and there was even a very popular band playing in town - and guests there to attend the concert - and no one was noisy.  You get free REAL breakfast and during the week (Mon - Thur) they have some sort of buffet set out in the evening.  There is a nice little pool and hot tub outside for warm months, and they have a market by the front desk where you can purchase stuff to eat - including Ben & Jerry's - 24 hrs.  The rooms are just little apartments, with kitchens that are fully stocked with all utinsels and cookware - there's even a dishwasher, and the fridge has an icemaker.  Just like a little home away from home - except quieter.  If you give the front desk person a list prior to 9 a.m., they will even grocery shop for you at no extra charge (except the groceries, which are billed to your room).  I've never stayed long enough to take advantage of the grocery shopping feature.  But, they shop at Food Lion.

Gee, I've strayed just a little......my oldest son has the flu.  My youngest son behaved worse today at daycare than he's probably ever behaved.  I didn't sleep but maybe a total of 2 hours last night, and had no nap today.  I spent $108 this morning before 10 a.m. at the doctor and drugstore - most on meds that will hopefully keep the rest of the family from catching the flu."

Better yet, why doesn't some rich person leave me a fortune so I never have to do anything that requires thought of any kind again?  Why can't I just sit outside somewhere and drink 40 oz. beers in paper bags and smile and muse and talk to myself and say, ""I was just talking to myself.""

This evening on the way home from stinky work, I stopped to buy gas.  While holding the pump to make sure it didn't fall out of my gas tank and spray gas all over me - like a good responsible person does - some woman pulled up to the pump right next to mine and was smoking in her car with 3 small children.  Then she opens her door, finishes her cigarette, throws it on the ground right between our cars STILL LIT and walks the kids into the convenience store.  I wanted to rip the gas pump hose off the machine and promptly strangle her stupid ass with it.  WHY, WHY, WHY, WHY are there so many fricking stupid people around here????????????????

An old man approached me and asked me to help him push his broken down car off the road.  Well, we pushed and pushed all through the neighborhood and couldn't find a place to park that stupid old car.  I guess we finally did park it somewhere, but I remember feeling very uneasy about the dream.

I don't know if it was the same dream or not, but I also dreamt my husband was a car theif.

Tomorrow is my 4th wedding anniversary.  Also, it is the day I have my annual blood pressure labs.  I have to be tranquilized for this procedure, since when anyone comes at me with a needle, I tend to want to kick them as hard as I can repeatedly.  This doesn't do much for the adrenalin levels, which is one of the things they test for in my blood.  BLOOOOOD.  Yuck.

I have a headache again.  I think I am prematurely dying.  If my family were set up financially, I wouldn't really worry too much about that, but they're screwed if I croak, so I hope I don't croak too soon.  I haven't cleaned my colon, yet, though.  I am waiting until after the 24th, when I think I'll make an appointment to have someone else look at my blood under a microscope and see if I have any disorders that a good cleansing would help.

I am so poor I can't pay attention.  And now, my PMS seems to be extending itself to AMS (after menstrual syndrome).  I hate this physical getting old.  I don't think I want to participate in this aging process.  I like the knowledge and wisdom thing, just not the drecrepidness (I don't think that's a word).  I'm all depressed and shit.

I can't eat after 10 p.m., until after the bloodwork.  The doctor will be late in the morning - even though he's requiring me to be in the office at 8:30 a.m., he has the audacity to show up late.  Oh, who gives a good goddam?  He's just a man."

But, you see, the thing about king crab leg shells is that they are extremely pokey and thick, making them hard to crack.  So, here I was, sitting in a booth that had lost its spring action, so my chin is about 6 inches from the table.  I've got my elbows up in the air, straining to crack this crab leg shell.  Well, I did it!  And the end of the claw cracked off and shot across the table, hitting my husband in the head.  He was not injured, so it was really funny!  I even told the waitress about it when she came around.  She was not as amused as I was.  She's probably used to it.  I have decided that Red Lobster is the place to work if you are a lesbian or a lesbian in training.  It is the R.L.A.L.L.T. (Red Lobster Already Lesbian and Lesbian Training)unit.  Mandi put the MAN in Mandi.  They were all very nice and efficient.

Last night, we watched a movie my husband rented, called Sideways.  Do not watch this movie with your woman if you want to have an easy time laying her afterward.  It is not conducive to getting laid.  But, we managed.

"event","#1 - I dreamt last night that I'd taken my husband's new guitar away from him and was going to give it to an old boyfriend.  This is because I was mad at everyone in my house last night, and made several loud and inappropriate comments - after putting up with a bunch of crap for several days.  I made everyone go to bed/couch without a nice word from me.  I put the alarm clock out on the living room table so my husband could wake himself up for a change.  This did me no good, because I woke up about ten minutes before the alarm went off, and then I heard it go off anyway.  He turned it off and went right back to sleep.  So, I got up and made coffee.  This woke him up.  We are barely speaking now.  I was thinking about taking off one night this weekend by myself, but I don't want to waste money on a hotel room.  By this weekend, I probably won't be mad anymore (I will hopefully not be on my period anymore), so maybe I'll ask SOMEONE to babysit on Sunday, so my husband and I can use my Red Lobster gift certificate that I got for Christmas, and maybe we can look for a ladder, too.

#2 - Today, while I was supposed to be working, but wasn't, I came across an article about all the parasites and junk that live in your colon.  It was totally gross and eye-opening.  I am going to try a cleansing sometime and see if it makes me feel better.  I've read a few Edgar Cayce books that suggest this procedure for various maladies - all of which I have.  There is not one day of my life when I don't feel bad for some reason or another.  I don't think I should feel like this.  Go to: http://www.drnatura.com/ and read all the testimonials, etc.  It will gross you out.  Look at the photo gallery, too.  It's hard to believe, but makes sense.

#3 - I got a raise yesterday.  The same day I was looking for other jobs online - at work - because the job is sucky.  Apparently I am really good at a sucky job.  Does this make me sucky, too?

#4 - My 10-yr-old's school pictures came in today.  They are great!  (This IS flowery).  Now, we need to take the 3-yr-old somewhere to have his made.  His current daycare doesn't do pictures.  My kids are so cute!

#5 - I've been eating a lot of cereal in the evenings lately.  Specifically Honey Bunches of Oats with Real Peaches.  This is to try and make up for lunches that are probably larger and more fattening than is necessary.  Today I had french onion soup, half a turkey sandwich and half a loaded baked potato, from Ruby Tuesday.  I was SO FULL!  The french onion soup was really good.  I hadn't had that in a long time.  As a matter of fact, I think I've only had it one other time, and I was about 19.  It was very salty, though.

#6 - The other night, my husband was playing his new guitar and it sounded so good.  He really is talented.  When I win that newfangled lottery, I might buy him an upright piano.  Or maybe I'll take the guitar away and give it to an old boyfriend (see #1)."

"event","Well, I got up at 7:45, this morning.  That's two hours later than a work day.  But, I went to sleep at 12:00, this morning, so I suppose I got an equal amount of sleep.  My legs and feet hurt every day when I get up.  My guess is this is atrophe.  I need to actually do something that doesn't require sitting in a chair.  Ever since I took the current job (5 1/2 years ago), I've had leg problems.  I am lazy and need motivation.  Apparently, the loss of my legs hasn't been enough motivation so far.  But, it's sunny outside and I'm going to take a walk somewhere today if it kills me.

More later, gotta doot."

"event","I had a very disturbing dream a couple of nights ago.  I had found a photograph of me and a couple of other little girls playing in our nightgowns by a Christmas tree.  I knew somehow that these girls' names were Nicki and Veronica.  I knew also that they were my sisters.  What I didn't know was where the hell they were now, and what had happened that caused them to be erased from my life.  My parents would not tell.  It was so real and I was upset for a while after I woke up.  If I let myself think about it, it still upsets me."

"event","Zachary and I went to see this movie on the evening of my birthday.  It was pretty good, but I felt it wasn't detailed enough - probably because I read the book(s).  The girl who played Lucy obviously sucks/ed her thumb.  That's disturbing to me.  I don't know why.  I did like that way they did the mermaids (who only made a 2-second appearance) and some of the other creatures."

"event","Well, poop has hit the proverbial fan.  I'm hearing poop stories everywhere.  My littlest had a poop accident yesterday evening, my husband has barely avoided them today.  Who's next?  Dumb question.  Of course I'm next.  I have to add poop control problems to bladder control problems.  I should just buy diapers.

I've not made any resolutions this year.  I feel it's a waste of time.  I only lasted a few weeks with the first set I'd made in years, year before last.  Last year I resolved to be a better person.  I guess maybe I am better in some respects.  I guess maybe that is a pretty safe resolution.  I could try out a resolution to avoid negative thoughts.  That would be more of a challenge than a resolution, though.

I am to be commended for not quitting my sucky job today.  Oh, it sucked so bad.  I hate to say it, but I dislike a lot of old people.  I dislike a lot of people in general.  Welp, there goes my negative thought avoidance challenge.  Better think of something else for the new year.

Bush is still in the White House.  Can't someone please impeach that son of a bitch?!  Someone has to be stupid enough to blow him and tell about it.  Someone with more money and oil and family connections has to really hate that monkey-faced asshole.  Oh, and Mr. Bush, if you're reading this, I'm just practicing my freedom of speech, not planning to do away with you - while you ignore my civil rights.  By the way, the market isn't doing as well, and the deficit is back up there I would wager.  Are you from outer space?  You are a spoiled brat.  Get an English degree.  That is really why I hate you; you can't speak worth a damn.  Any public figure better be well versed in the native language of the country he/she represents.  You are a disgrace.  How am I supposed to get my ten-year-old son to speak correctly with you as an example all over the airwaves?  You should be ashamed of yourself!  I change the channel from your general direction!  I turn to WB and PBS, instead.  I turn to quality television like Two-and-a-Half Men, and Britcoms!  Will and Grace!  These people make me laugh because they mean to and they are funny.  I am not laughing at your ignorance of English.  Pah!  The only thing I like about you is your dog.  Your dog is pretty cool.  You might be an alright guy if you weren't a politician, who knows.  But, I won't be your friend unless you can learn to say NUCLEAR, instead of NUCULAR.  Good God, Man!  You just get to work on that right now.  Your wife is probably alright.  Did you take this job just to stay out of her hair?

I've got it!  Eureka!  I will clean  my room - including the closet - this year.  This could take all year.  There's enough dust in there to take all year getting it out.  I'll need a mask.  I need someone to help me out in the area of scrap booking.  I have many a scrap that needs booking.  ""Book em Danno.""

I'm not pooping yet.  I figure it'll start tomorrow afternoon.

End pot - I mean post."

"event","Well, I crashed last night at about 11:30 p.m.  Woke up when I heard the commotion of fireworks outside at midnight, went back to sleep promptly and had a naughty dream that was not about my husband.  Oooops!  Ironically, it was about an ex-co-worker who is really big and fat.  Oh well, there's no accounting for taste in dreams, I suppose.

I've been extremely lazy today.  Only did two or three loads of laundry, sat around playing Sims2 for a while after I fed my son and put him to nap.  My husband took a nap also.  This is becomming a ritual for him on the one day he is home on the weekend.  I've been sick for 3 1/2 weeks and can't get rid of the cough.  It's not that bad, except at night sometimes, and I chalk that up to my good ole athsma.  Yay.  If you have a cold, do not come within 100 ft. of me or I will beat your ass.

I thought about calling my sister this morning, but I did not, because I figured she was probably up late and still sleeping, and her girlfriend has the day off and they need time alone.  I might call her tomorrow, on my birthday, if I wake up on time.  My husband has the day off, and so does my oldest son, but the youngest has daycare, so I think we're going to go see The Chronicles of Narnia, if I can get my lazy ass moving.  I just can't get my strength back after being sick.  Whatever.

My husband made homemade quacamole this afternoon and it was the bomb.  The grocery store had avocados on sale for 79 cents a piece (limit 4), so he bought 4.  They are RIPE.  Anybody want any quacamole?

Anyway, I am sincerely hoping that 2006 is better than 2005 was.  I had a lousy year at work, had to put my son back in the 4th grade again, Bush is in the Whitehouse, my period is coming closer and closer together, had an angiogram among other crap, including a cancer/artery blockage scare, lost a friend when I found out she was a big, fat liar.  I did seem to tolerate my mother better, though.  Chalk one up for me.  Yay.  I did go to CA to visit my in-laws.  I love them, but the trip sucked.  We did get to stay in a posh resort at the expense of the airline for a few hours, though.  I'd really like it if I could win the lottery jackpot this year - millions of dollars to pay off bills and set us all up for old age.  I'll keep that dream going, and hopefully I will stop having pervy dreams about fat guys.

Take care of yourself in 2006, and I hope I see you more this year.  We don't spend enough time together.

Later."

"event","Well it has been awhile since I have had time to put pen to paper so to speak.
Things are hopping in the old studio definatly a carefull what you ask for kinda thing, Iam busy as stink. All good.
Work and home are all great,as for my retarded sister Jackie I swear she has lost her mind or maybe Iam to miserable.
Back in January she remarried after a perticularly ugly divorce.
The ex was just an ass now jump forward to this June she has moved with the new husband to the west coast bla bla bla!!!!
Jackie has returned this past week to Edmonton for surgery here and guess where her and the new husband are staying, YUP at the old husbands place!!!!!!!!! 
Now apperently they are all just the best of friends and The ex is thinking of moving to BC and buying the lot across the street from them.What the fuck is up with that?
If my ex walked into the street my first impulse would be to run over him.
Maybe it is just me.
Can't wait for the weekend going to vist our friends in Rimbey and celebrate Ed's birthday. Just can't help but think we will have fun. 
I must try to write more often, I get to wrapped up in things at work and forget to breath."

"event","I ve been so completely swamped,stupid busy for the last three weeks I can barely stand it.
My new studio is great and I find it much more condusive to a proper train of thought.Physiclly it is easier as well.Iam not hauling books and samples in and out of places. YEH!!!
I have alot of great projects on the go for clients, none for my own house ,you know, Shoemakers children and all that.
Ed is so busy he can hardly drag his butt home at night, I sure hope the farrier biz slaks off a bit soon or he could snap.
We are off to Vancouver for the long weekend,we leave on Weds. afternoon. It has been awhile and I do so miss the place.
Iam looking forward to see Gayle and Lex.
Speaking of folks from the past scuttle butt is that Dave and Greta of Brass Rail fame are expecting twins. They already have a 2 year old girl. I would have never thought she would actually have kids, just in case she got fat. Iam such a bitch!!!!!!!! HAHA."

"event","I have to say that our 10th anniversary has bee pretty good so far. I been spoiled by Ed more then I deserve,2 dozen roses,a spa day and the best tickets to Phantom of the Opera.That cowboy knows how to treat a girl. I&nbsp; sure Iam lucky Karen didn't trip me as I got up to meet him in the bar all those years ago or she would be writting this. HAHAHA 
Ten years ago right now Simon was pouring me a new bride drink to calm my nerves.All of our great friends were there and there are so many we haven't seen in so long as we have all gone our separate ways all over the world. Such is life!! 
I am so fortunate to have married this great guy.It is a calming place that he puts my heart knowing how much he loves me.A little sappy but none the less. 
That he has no reservations about showing or telling the world that he loves me is pretty great.It has been a terrific day to remember. 
Well we are off to dinner."

"event","Well it's been abusy 2 weeks.Our friend Karen and hubby came for dinner and drinks and we had a great time I only wish Karen lived closer so we could do more things together.Then we were of to wonderfull Winnipeg. If I didn't have children
and grandchildren thats one place I would never go back to.It was good to see the kids I do miss them so far away and it was a great vist got to see Josh's new condo that he and his girlfreind lindsay just got . It's kind of hard to grasp my baby having his own condo. 
Yes Yes I know they grow up. Lindsay is a great gal kind of hippie dippie and makes great motzah ball soup. She say she will teach me the fine art of Jewish cooking.
Lindsay would like me to go with her and get a tattoo next time we are there and it has been on my list of things to do before Iam 50.
I also have decided to open a studio in Spruce Grove and stop working from home. I think this is a good move. It will be less wear and tear on me, people can come to me and this is a growing oppertunity for me. It is very exciting. All those years ago while I slaved away at UBC in the day and the Brass Rail at night,I hoped I would have my own studio . This will no doubt keep me busy for the next month. we will shoot for a mid May Grand Opening. 
Ed too is just stupid busy he must be doing 50 horses a week, and it is only April.HOLY!!!
I just kiss him goodbye in April and hello in November.
Thats probably how we have stayed married, are you ready ""10 years"" on April 20th.
It doesn't seem that long ago we were having so much fun at our Wedding.
Anyway must run Hope to here from you all."

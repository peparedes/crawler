"event","The bad thing about working for a chiropractor is that he believes I need adjusted as well.&nbsp; Of course I have that pesky little partially dislocated shoulder from, oh about <i>eleven years ago</i>.&nbsp; He heard it pop and started writing out the x-ray referral then and there; you know it's a bad sign when a chiropractor hears it from across the room and shudders with, ""That just <i>sounds</i> like it hurt.""<br /><br />So I had my x-rays done today.&nbsp; When they found out that I was working for him, I got to cut a two hour wait time, which was made even better by a seven year old boy whining loudly, ""But mommy~~~~!&nbsp; We were here first~~~!""&nbsp; Ohohoho, indeed.&nbsp; The person who took me back was probably a year or two older than myself and perfectly pleasant.&nbsp; Had me snickering when she said, ""Go ahead and strip.&nbsp; I'll be waiting right outside for you.""&nbsp; Oh <i>really</i>?&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you now? <br /><br />It should also be pointed out that I hadn't had much sleep, it was an AM appointment on my day off, and I'm PMSing and shouldn't be allowed to interact with women who aren't Lily.&nbsp; Thus, my mood was rather...scattered.<br /><br />She comes over to me with one of those lead blankets and looks at me and asks the lovely standard question that I hate having to do the math on, so I figured three weeks sounded like a good answer.&nbsp; She narrows her eyes, raises her eyebrows and asks, ""So~~~is there any chance that you could be pregnant?""<br /><br />....<br /><br />See, the thing is, this is the same place that I went to for an ultrasound for internal damage and while I was on the table, equipment in place, the older woman asked, ""So are you excited about being pregnant?""&nbsp; Considering I had never even had sex at that point, it was a hell of a question to be asked.&nbsp; ""Sorry, I'm just so used to asking women that with this procedure!"" was her defense.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thus this time, when I was asked, I curtly say, ""No,"" and wanted to move on because I got cold.<br /><br />She crosses her arms, gives me a dubious look, and asks in that certain tone of voice that never fails to rile me up, ""Are you <i>sure</i>?""<br /><br />I swear I didn't <i>mean</i> to say what I did, it just kind of slipped out in a vaguely harsh tone, ""Considering I haven't been fucked in over three years, yeah, I'm sure.""&nbsp; Realizing that the woman was just doing her job, I back peddle to a minor extent with a kinder, ""...huh.&nbsp; That came out more bitter than expected, sorry about that.&nbsp; Well, I guess it was either that answer or I was going to tell you I was a lesbian.""<br /><br /><i>Why </i>I said that, I still have no friggin' clue.&nbsp; She waited for a heartbeat before asking, ""...<i>are</i> you a lesbian?""<br /><br />She was apparently disappointed that the answer was, ""No.""&nbsp; And while I thought fucking with her head and saying I had a female for a husband (Love you if you're reading this~~~but you already knew that), I decided I had probably had enough unintentional fun with the woman.&nbsp; Although I couldn't resist being evil when she started <strike>fondling</strike> <strike>positioning</strike> moving my shoulder and asked, ""So why are you here?""&nbsp; She had one hand on my arm, her other on my lower back (hey, guess what?&nbsp; Not part of the exam!) and I oh-so-casually popped my shoulder as I lightly replied, ""For that.""&nbsp; When she asked how it happened, I told her I fell out of bed--which was true.&nbsp; When she asked what I was doing at the time...let's just say that I didn't have to say a single word and she was blushing like hell.&nbsp; Ahahaha, that was more entertaining than it should have been.&nbsp; Yay for ambiguously perverse smirking!&nbsp; If she only knew it was while I was reading a <i>book</i>.&nbsp; ::laughs::<br /><br />Did I mention she offered to help me get dressed when I was done?<br /><br />Never a dull moment in the life of me, ne?&nbsp; In other news, turns out my shoulder is almost <i>completely</i> dislocated.&nbsp; My dad's on one hell of a self-imposed guilt trip, needless to say.&nbsp; I told him not to look at the images, but he wouldn't listen; he liked the computer program the images are displayed in on the CD-R they gave me.&nbsp; And hey, it turns out that my neck is really fucked up, which was news to me.&nbsp; The doctor just keeps staring at me in shock and asking in disbelief, ""You're not in <i>any</i> pain?&nbsp; You don't have any migraines?&nbsp; You really don't have any complaints about your neck at <i>all</i>?""&nbsp; Turns out two of my vertebrae are pointed in the completely opposite direction of where they should be and I've no clue how that happened.&nbsp; Can't wait to hear what he's going to say about the results, haha.&nbsp; I'm going to be lucky if I don't have to go back for an MRI and more x-rays of the rest of my spine and my hand, I swear.<br /><br />Wonder who takes me back next time?&nbsp; ::snickers::"

"event","My mood has been all over the place tonight--of course, that would be an understatement.&nbsp; It actually started a few days ago and much as I try to remember, I can't remember what set the thought off, but I sure as hell know where it ended up heading.&nbsp; I ran into someone I used to know and I realized that it was actually somewhat painful to have to socialize and associate myself with someone I've had little reason to do as such.&nbsp; It was only after I got in the car that I realized I had problems with making eye contact, let alone maintaining it.&nbsp; Ah yes, that was it.&nbsp; Because I remembered the night we went over to his house together for his birthday.&nbsp; It reminded me of the fragments of what might have been and how glad I am that it didn't work out that way.&nbsp; And yet despite that gratitude, the lack of security was upsetting, but so was the alternative.&nbsp; If I had not gone south of fucked up in the head, I would most likely be engaged or married at the moment and that just fucks with me.&nbsp; I would have been tied to someone that would have been terrible for me in the long run, but sometimes I miss it.&nbsp; Not him--just it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course reading up on the rat has done little for the improvement of my self reflection.&nbsp; Randomly spliced:<br /><i><br />Behind the smiles and charm, rats can be terribly obstinate and controlling, insisting on having things their way no matter what the cost. These people tend to have immense control of their emotions, which they may use as a tool to manipulate and exploit others, both emotionally and mentally. Rats are masters of mind games and can be very dangerous, calculative and downright cruel if the need arises. Quick-tempered and aggressive, they will not think twice about exacting revenge on those that hurt them in any way. Rats need to learn to relax sometimes, as they can be quite obsessed with detail, intolerant and strict, demanding order, obedience, and perfection.<br /><br />People born in the year of the mouse are able to keep secrets, but they enjoy finding out the secrets of other people. They may use such information as a weapon and are not satisfied until they have achieved someone's destruction. They seek loopholes without feeling shame. In a word, they lose no chances.&nbsp; Since such a person tries his best to hide his feelings.<br /><br />They also keep many mementos in their rooms, and keep distressed memories in their hearts. Maybe this is because of their desire to accumulate. Although they are willing to poke their noses into other people's business, they mean good.</i>     <p><i>People born in the year of the mouse have good memories. They like to ask questions and have keen insights. Such a person knows almost everybody and keeps everything around them in mind. Others take it for granted if a person born in the year of the mouse becomes an excellent writer.&nbsp; Because of their cool and quick-witted minds, their keen insight and deep understanding of life, defeats in life sharpen their minds and make them out of ordinary.</i></p>And so on and so forth.&nbsp; I really can be a bastard, but we already knew that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like to hope that I've moved beyond some of my old ways, but my regression around others in Japan kind of kills my faith in that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, there really wasn't much of a point here, so I think I'll go to sleep since I have work in the morning.&nbsp; Fun times.&nbsp; Despite that, I'm reservedly/cautiously optimistic about the new year and it's possibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if only I get into graduate school, I'll be set.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, and having waaaay too much fun with <i>Devil May Cry 4</i> and my little emotard; pity that between it and typing, my left wrist is being a right little bitch.&nbsp; As long as it's just the wrist, right?&nbsp; Ahahaha.&nbsp; But hey, I got to drive with the top down in February without freezing, so that was awesome.<br /><br />Like I said, all over the place.&nbsp; But enough, time for bed."

"event","I told twenty seven lies today.&nbsp; I told them to keep everyone away, to stop them from asking questions I didn't want to hear, to try and maintain the illusion that I'm better than I am.&nbsp; Self preservation and self protection seems like a fine line that I don't want to end up on the wrong side of again.&nbsp; Three were because I lashed out and knew the minute that I did so, I changed an acquaintanceship; I saw that instant look of fear in her eyes and I smiled victoriously at her.&nbsp; It felt better than when I had the kid on the floor and almost broke his hand the other week.&nbsp; His was pure pain, but hers was entirely fear based and the reaction I had to that only got to me after the fact, which is disgusting.&nbsp; I should not have felt that heady, that pleased and self satisfied over such a thing.&nbsp; It should not have felt good, especially since I knew that it wasn't because of my words -- I didn't say a single hurtful thing about her -- it was simply the way that I looked at her with my predatorial smirk.&nbsp; <br /><br />The weirdest part?&nbsp; She kissed me later in the day and that was just WTF worthy.&nbsp; She acted like I was supposed to reciprocate and I just stared at her like, ""The hell?"" and did nothing.&nbsp; I got upgraded from being kicked, punched, and slapped at random to that?&nbsp; Makes no fucking sense.&nbsp; Those two incidents made me understand a little more why Lily-sama thinks I'd be perfect for some S&amp;M joint, though.&nbsp; The guy I had on the floor now says, ""Hi,"" to me all the time and then she fucking starts hugging me and kissing me like I'm some cute little pet.&nbsp; How I did not retaliate against her, I do not know.&nbsp; But this viciousness, it is not a good thing, especially when heightened by an aggression due to timing.&nbsp; I need a goddamn outlet for this bullshit and it's just not happening.&nbsp; Which is probably for the best at the moment since I would probably break it in my interest of escaping everything and a personal harem to work through is just not an option.&nbsp; Fuck.&nbsp; I don't think there are enough hours or people to try and pound all of those thoughts out of my mind.<br /><br />I'm just tired of faking a smile; even more so when I remember just how long its been since I've had to.&nbsp; How long it's been since I've had to pretend to tolerate people that surround me, that I've had to laugh when the social cue commands it despite my complete and utter lack of interest at such inane and trivial stupidity.&nbsp; I hate it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I forgot just how much I loathe the general populace, how draining faking social interactions are.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's making me remember just how much I hate the false front of myself it creates out of habit.&nbsp;  <br /><br />But in my fear of time, I'm regressing into those old patterns; shielding and being on the offensive to ward off anything that has the potential to come too close.&nbsp; I could give a damn about what they think of me at this point.&nbsp; Why that same attitude cannot apply to recommendation requests is beyond me.&nbsp; Why the fuck do universities require such bullshit things?&nbsp; What teacher wouldn't right positive things?&nbsp; It's just more fucking paper work.&nbsp; I'm out of time and using it as an excuse.&nbsp; But then what?&nbsp; What the fuck then?&nbsp; ""Is this it?"" echoes and I hate it.&nbsp; Shit.&nbsp; I don't want to fall apart over the future.&nbsp; The fucking future that everyone keeps predicting like some mystical bullshit fortune cookie.&nbsp; Sometimes I really think that I was better off ignoring it.&nbsp; The only thing that gets to me more than this grad school bullshit is returning to the house.&nbsp; I forgot how much I hated that crushing suffocation of, ""What the fuck am I doing?""&nbsp; I don't want this again, don't want to hear this shit in my head.&nbsp; <br /><br />And goddamn does my wrist fucking hurt.&nbsp; Now shit's moving around when I apply pressure and I'm pretty sure that's not a good sign.&nbsp; I wonder which will fall apart faster: my body or my brain?<i><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;""></span></i>"

"event","I had a dream about van Gogh last night.&nbsp; <br /><br />That cannot be a good sign.&nbsp; Especially when the first time I tried to type that sentence it came out as, ""Van Gogh had a dream about me last night.""&nbsp;&nbsp; Shit.<br /><br />I don't know where the fuck my head is, but I need to get my shit together.&nbsp; Otherwise I'm going to fuck myself up royally here, fuck up graduate school, end up back at home without a clue as what the fuck to do, and I'd really rather not end up going out of my skull again.&nbsp; But man, waking up after having a dream about a dead manic depressive artist telling you to basically calm the fuck down, it just fucks you up for the day.&nbsp; Especially because that was the first fifteen minutes of restful silence I had in a long time.&nbsp; The fact that there's any comfort in those dreams should probably disturb me more than it does.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then again, the other day I had a freak out that started off at graduate school and led to me getting all the way up to watching my own Dateline NBC special where they were interviewing people who knew me and wondered ""what went wrong,"" all of that before I could get the brain to shut up long enough to do something else.&nbsp; Good god.&nbsp; When the fuck did this happen?&nbsp; I should be fucking ecstatic and instead it feels like my brain is trying to fall apart when I'm not looking.&nbsp; What the fuck is a future, anyway?&nbsp; At least the past is finite and manageable, but goddamn does the future freak the fuck out of me.&nbsp; When you've spent the majority of your life believing that it didn't exist, it's fucking overwhelming and I can't seem to get the thought across or dealt with properly on any level.&nbsp; I just keep yelling at it to shut the fuck up, shut the fuck off and just let me do and be, but it's becoming increasingly annoying.&nbsp; And this country is bad for the distractions.&nbsp; <br /><br />But still, it's lurking and it scares the shit out of me.&nbsp; Because I realized this week why I remember everything about people and it made me hate myself.&nbsp; Hate the person I used to be, rather.&nbsp; Or maybe even now.&nbsp; I keep thinking I should be stronger than this, but goddamn.&nbsp; November has to be better than October and I'm scaring the shit out of myself.&nbsp; A girl that I talk to went to pat my head and I flinched; my teacher touched my hand to make me do rock-paper-scissors (don't even get me started about the bullshit of Sports Day and running), and my first reaction was to smack it away with a, ""Don't touch me,"" in Japanese.&nbsp; Because that went over real well.&nbsp; Fuck.&nbsp; I keep telling myself it was his sweaty palms.&nbsp; Here, outside of the brushing past people on trains, there is no physical contact.&nbsp; So suddenly forced into it, I seem to be shying away from it or responding badly to it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just can't commit to graduate school, but I don't know what else to do, but I'm afraid of fucking everything up -- both through action and inaction.&nbsp; Can't fucking win that one.&nbsp; And the more errors I fucking make in class, the more it freaks me out.&nbsp; I just don't know what the fuck I want because I've never had to think that far ahead.&nbsp; It's sounds terrible and morbid, but I never thought I'd make it this far.&nbsp; So I never planned a wedding (who the fuck would want to be with a headcase like me at this point?) because I didn't want to drag anyone else into my shit, I never thought about ""what I want to be when I grow up,"" because I didn't think I would grow up -- I thought I'd be dead.&nbsp; And in my head I already was grown up, if not A Grown Up, if that makes sense.&nbsp; But how the hell do I say that to my parents without them freaking out like crazy?&nbsp; They'll be all, ""Zomigod, you're suicidal,"" and I'm not, nowhere even close and the thought hasn't crossed my mind in many years, thankfully.&nbsp; But there is no way for me to say, ""What is the point of it all?&nbsp; Going to school, getting another degree, getting a job, and then what?&nbsp; What the fuck then?&nbsp; A nine to five desk job, to know that on any given Tuesday, you can fast forward a year and I'd still be at the same desk, doing the same shit, it just makes it hard to breathe.&nbsp; Jump five, same desk, same shit.&nbsp; Even if it's a different company, it's all the same.&nbsp; And all of this mental angst for what?&nbsp; For a desk.&nbsp; For a paycheck.&nbsp; To buy shit.&nbsp; What moves people forward?&nbsp; What does everyone else see in it that I just cannot get?&nbsp; To me that is not security, that's fucking scary.&nbsp; I don't want to wake up in ten years and realize that the only thing that has changed is my face.""&nbsp; No, my parents wouldn't handle that at all.&nbsp; So I rant about it here and hope that it gets out of my system.&nbsp; But goddamn, I forgot how noisy my head gets when it starts sending out tendrils.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is it any wonder van Gogh was a comfort?&nbsp; Shit, that was the best dream I've had in months.&nbsp; I really hate my head sometimes.<br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;""></span>"

Now for homework, but I'd rather be writing smut.&nbsp; Actually, I'd rather be doing the smut than writing it, but that's just a given.&nbsp; Of course, it doesn't help that because of YGO:TAS I can't get, ""I Like Your Booty (But I'm Not Gay),"" out of my head, either.&nbsp; And it's all Koda Kumi's fault.&nbsp; &gt;_&lt;&nbsp; I guess I should just be grateful that I don't have access to the ""Juciy"" or ""Candy"" PVs and that I refuse to watch anything but the DVD rip and I don't have enough room on my portable harddrive to redownload it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the swords make me go woah.&nbsp; But they tend to in general.&nbsp; Gackt with a sword fighting in the forest on my TV last Sunday was totally made of the awesome and, ""More please.""&nbsp; Ohohoho.

It's not that I don't belong in this world, per se, but I just feel like I'm moving outside a different time than everyone else.  There's just something inherently wrong with staying up until almost 8AM when I'm not in college and I don't have a reason to still be awake.

The silence was good while it lasted, but I'll wait it out another day.

He's the kind of guy who'll think I've been in a carwreck because I won't answer the phone and yet I can't bring myself to care.

It's a silence I know I'll break.  Eventually.

I've been living in silence a lot these days, all blank pages and blank looks.

I killed a spider and then I lost the corpse.

It can't be a blank wall if there's a window.

I'll just disregard this and wait to sleep it out, because eyes closing on sunrises and opening on sunsets isn't a place I need to be in again.  I have a week to convince myself this is just PMSing and not depression.  I just need sleep.  Real sleep that is deep and dreamless and wake up refreshed.  Ready to cope.  Ready to make a decision.  Or something other than this.

Quite times.  After tomorrow's oral surgeon I should find out whether or not the results from my tests from Thursday require a doctor follow-up/surgery so that should be real fun.  Then it's my teeth ripped out of my head time.

"event","There's nothing really to update about still.  Just doctors and family visits which aren't very interesting, nor are they the way that I feel like spending my time.  

I feel like I'm running out of time, that's for damn sure.  I can read Japanese quite well now, I'm still pretty decent at understanding it, but the composition and speaking end of it are going to be what kills me.  I can't make my brain connect the characters I know how to read into ones I know how to draw.  At least I'm getting better at inferring meaning while reading.  It's amazing how quickly you can pick stuff up when you're going along at it with a kanji dictionary, heh.  I am so addicted to Gokusen it's not even funny.  Teacher-student tensions -- go figure.  Some things never change, although the fact that it's female teacher and younger male <i>does</i> come as a bit of a surprise.  I loved the drama, I enjoyed the anime, and I'm obsessed with the manga.  Hard core.  As in, <i>I started writing a fanfic</i>.  It started off as a cute little idea that ended up blossoming into twelve pages single spaced. o_O  And it's still not done.  o_O again, I think.  It just figures that I haven't written anything in forever and a half and then I finally do, only to have it be a fanfic.  Damn.  The GRE puilled me away from it, sadly.  I should really go back and look at it, even though it's frustrating because I know it isn't my best work, my sentences aren't nearly as strong (although I don't have anyone to verify that besides my overly harsh inner critic), but I love my idea.  So I'll take what I can get.

That aside, I'm still vascillating between ""Holy shit, this is so exciting!"" and ""Holy shit, what in the hell have I gotten myself into?!""  Especially when I start looking at the calendar and realize just how few days I really have, it's kind of hard not to feel that little pit of, ""Oh dear god...."" you know?  I know I need to review verbs and work on writing original stuff rather than translating.  Sometimes I really wonder if I'm going to be able to pull this off, but I suppose it's a little late to be worrying about that now.  About three months too late and six thousand dollars too late, methinks.  I'm just praying to god we don't have to do skits because that's the worst.  >_<  I think having a conversation and improvising shows more knowledge than the ability to memorize the sounds in a certain order.  Hated, hated, <i>hated</i> that in high school.  Thankfully it was a little hard to have skits in Latin.  But Latin was full of it's own set of problems, a la ""Piscina Mensa Puer"" and all other sorts of fun times that led to me getting a lower grade.

I just keep trying to tell myself that I'll be fine, but seriously, it's a little hard to have confidence when you don't know what you've gotten yourself into.  If nothing else, volume fourteen of Gokusen gets released within two weeks of my being there, so that's a perk in and of itself.  ::laughs::  Addict.  

But sleep for now becuase tomorrow brings not one, but <i>two</i> doctors.  ::sighs::"

"event","It's amazing how quickly time disappears when your mother insists on sending you to every doctor possible.  Goddamn.  Two visits to the dentist, two visits to dental surgeon, an ovarian test, a follow up to that (which could result in a surgery + follow up for that), a therapist visit, a visit to my GP, and my eye doctor.  >_<  That's a lot of damn doctors for someone who isn't actually ill.

To top it off, there were some unexpected visitors.  My grandparents self-invited themselves over here this weekend.  

Oh, and I'm taking the GREs.  At 8AM today, as a matter of fact.  Which means I have to be there by 7.30AM, which means I have to leave here at 7.00AM, which means I have to get up at ~6.30AM.  Not happy with this development that was sprung upon me at 11.30PM <i>two damn days ago</i>.  Was planning on doing it in mid-September but my lovely array of doctor appointments has made that impossible.  So wish me luck because I've done almost no studying and this is pretty much winging it since I haven't had to do any math in five or so years.  Wheee.  If it goes terribly, I'm forgoing immediate graduate school and running away to go teach somewhere, most likely Japan.  In case you cared. ^_^

So an attempt to sleep."

<i>The boy wizard is about to bare all.

Daniel Radcliffe is attempting to shed his Harry Potter image--and, subsequently, his clothes--signing on to star in London's West End production of Peter Shaffer's ""Equus,"" a role that will require the 17-year-old star to appear naked onstage.

The actor is set to star as psychologically disturbed stable boy Alan Strang in the play about the erotic relationship between the said boy and his horses. The drama chronicles Strang's interviews with a psychiatrist after it's revealed he has inexplicably blinded six of the animals with a metal spike.

<b>Nudity isn't the only potentially embarrassing onstage hurdle for Radcliffe. The actor's stage debut also requires him to simulate sexual pleasure while riding naked on a horse.</i></b>

The thought of that boy riding a horse naked across stage while pretending to masturbate is pretty damn funny to me.  I'd love to see <i>those</i> acting abilities, even if it <i>does</i> make me sound a bit pervy....."

"event","So it's been finalized: I am officially going to Japan this fall semester!!  Part of me can't believe it and the other part of me knows I need to start busting my ass off studying.  I started slacking off because of the doubts, which was generally a bad plan.  >_<  But then again, when they raise questions because of certain medications and your doctor is a) on vacation and not readily available to help, and b) decides she'd rather not write a letter okaying you to go after she's already cleared you and would rather you go to the therapist she told the program you haven't seen, it holds up the system a little.  Thankfully I got her to write the letter, it got sent this morning, and I found out this evening I can go.  

Now all I have to do is withdraw from my NYU classes, have them put in a code that says I'm studying abroad, get a consortium agreement signed and sent, buy plane tickets, and find out if and how much doing an independent study at the same time would be possible.  Then it's just a matter of letting people know. ^_^;;  Ahhh, I'm so excited!  October to December; wish it was longer, but it being my senior year and all kind of puts a damper on that, but hey, at least I get to go, right?  

The real fun will be trying to apply to graduate programs while I'm over there.  Eheee.  Now I just need to take the goddamn GREs over the summer.  I hope they forgive the math because since I haven't taken an actual math class since my junior year of high school and even then I was terrible at it, I'm less than enthused about that section.  Thankfully they only care about the English portion for the programs I'm looking into, but I really hope they don't even look at the math.....

Did I mention I'm excited?  But for now, sleep, and then studying.  Yay!"

"event","I get worked up over the <i>weirdest</i> shit.  And as I sit here, I can only go, ""Oh, Vincent,"" because it always comes down to this.  Due to several events in my life, I keep expecting him to pop up in the dreams again.  Because when you have a dream that you are a salt shaker that gets spilt, only to have it turn into an hour glass and you're a princess inside of it on a spaceship, surely a van Gogh dream can't be far behind it.  Although, the only good thing about the aforementioned dream is the realization that sand <i>is</i> time.  By which, I mean to say, if time turns all things into sand and dust, then they are the truest indicators of time, thus the perfect thing to measure out time in an hour glass.

But I digress.

I recently bought a Moleskine journal to test it out and see if it would work out in Japan.  Having been a bit slow on the uptake, distracted by the label which states, ""The legendary notebook of Hemingway, Picasso, Chatin,"" the first two of whom I loathe, I temporarily forgot that it was the same notebook that van Gogh used for his sketches and letters.  And yes, I am that much of an art dork to know what sort of materials and journals were used by that man.  In the little printed history it even states that van Gogh in fact used them.  And me, being a cheap bastard, decide to go online and see if I can get it cheaper (since the book is a bit on the slim side and I know it would take multiples for a three month journey), only to come across a van Gogh <i>version</i>.  Have thus far resisted that one.

But it was done in conjunction with the van Gogh museum and I went to their site and promptly had my little fit.  It's the same one I had upon exiting the sketch exhibit at the Met last winter and the same one I had at the Philly museum last summer, which is the fact that the man's work is plastered all over <i>everything</i>.  A man such as him, who prided himself on his art, I can't imagine would be very happy to see his paintings made into goddamn <i>beach towels</i>.  His signature is plastered on pens, scarfs, ties, mugs -- it just makes me so sad because he only signed the works which he was proud of and I can't imagine a set of coasters is something that he would have endorsed with it, you know?  I get so damn defensive over it.  Especially when it's a painting that he didn't sign that is turned into things.  On the one hand, I feel like a frickin' idiot, but on the other hand, I have my suspicions that I'm not that far off base.

Then my mind wanders as a result of the current exhibit at the van Gogh museum of Japanese items and the paintings that were influenced as a result of them by him (which I would love to see but there's no way in hell I'm getting to Amsterdam any time ever).  I think my father would ban me from further studies if I mentioned the fact that I think part of my interests in the country and it's art was an indirect effect of van Gogh's.  Actually, if my father knew half of what I think about van Gogh, he'd probably roll his eyes and conclude that I am in fact insane.  It's not so much that I feel as if I got a not so subtle shove, so much as it is I got nudged on course in some sort of way.  Not many people realize just how deeply he was influenced by the Japanese, especially by Hiroshige.  I think I'm too tired to articulate my thoughts on the van Gogh Japonisme thing and it's relation to me, but I'm sure I'll come back to that later.  Methinks it's half the reason I'm almost convinced that I could just close my eyes, open the notebook, and reproduce one of his sketches if I was out of it enough.  Then again, last time I didn't think about it, I ended up writing in his handwriting without having had  seen that much of it.  Not to mention seeing things in dreams and not in books, only to discover that they fucking existed, colour scheme and all, which was really frightening on some levels since it was the ones of the mental institutions, but then again, since that's always where the dreams take place, I don't find it so surprising on other levels.  God, I sound crazy, don't I?

But in sum, I hate the exploitation of art.  Munch is another one that makes me sad to see.  People like Warhol and Lichenstein not so much since they were Pop Art and the poking fun at the consumerism and having it turn into the very thing it was lampooning amuses me.  But Munch, another who took his art deeply seriously, seeing it in car commercials is just frustrating, little blow up Screamers, it's just too much.  When you stand before his <i>Vampire</i> canvas, and you <i>see</i> how much he struggled with it, trying to find the right lines, the right colours, and it never was good enough.  How can a man that was terrified to let his father see his work, yet needed the approval at the same time, how can such a man be used in consummerism?  I almost feel bad seeing it in a museum because of that very struggle, let alone seeing <i>The Scream</i> all over marketing campaigns.  Nothing's fucking holy and it just makes me sad.  At least Vermeer and Caravaggio are left alone for the most part.  But damn.  I get worked up over the weirdest shit.  But hey, at least I'm not crying in front of a canvas this time. >_<"

"event","It's finally starting to quiet down here on this end, which is a pleasing thing, to be sure.  I at least know things are starting to look up whenever I have time to ponder the following, ""What exactly would Burnt Sienta smell like?""  Of course, then I realised that I didn't even know what ""Sienta"" was or why it would be burnt, or if I was even spelling it correctly....Of course that led me down a rabbit whole of why we don't wonder what other colours smell like and then I thought, ""If blue had a smell, what would it really smell like?""  

So I think that's a positive sign I'm starting to have too much time on my hands, yes.

My father is really starting to pressure me to publish again.  Or at the very least, try to figure out what is ""blocking"" me from doing as such.  Between that and his wavering support over my persuits of Japanese/Cinema studies, it's been real fun over here.  Studies are going well enough, although I keep getting pulled away from it to do work.  Which hey, at least that makes me some money.  Of course, I've yet to be paid in anything except Gackt merchandise, something I find very, very amusing.

Also, I <i>finally</i> managed to score myself a copy <i>Children of Paradise</i> tonight.  Took me long enough, but hey I got it with a 20% discount.  Of course, that is a little less pleasing to me now that New Jersey has decided to raise sales tax to 7%.  Makes me such a sad panda.  So I organize my iTunes a little more and try to calm myself.

But really, not a lot to report.  Getting a little further into Visual Kei which is probably not a good thing.  Have an itch for my cards again, but I'm not doing anything about it for some reason.  Saw Pirates II, loved the triangle, and all I really want right now is some Char-han from the ramen place and it's just not happening.  Besides, it's not the same without the company.  ::sniffle::  I'm also enjoying my Green Jasmine tea and am going to hunt for some decent tea mugs now.  Along with a journal to take with me to Japan, so I'm hurrying to finish the one that I have.  I'm just a few pages away from hitting 400, and when I realise that's only from January 2005 to present and doesn't count all the typed ones I've had since 2003 which waaaay surpass that....it's a lot of frickin' writing, let me tell you.  And then I wonder why my father goes, ""And out of all that, you don't have at least one book?""  Bah.

I have yet to receive my last paycheck either, something which is really starting to piss me off -- just <i>once</i> I'd like a boss who pays me what they owe me when they fucking <i>owe it</i>.  So that about sums it up, so I'm off to go burn off some stuff since my harddrive is once again hovering near the less than 10GBs and that's just not a good thing.

And, PS: How in the <i>hell</i> is already almost the middle of July?!"

It's almost enough to make me wish I still talked to him so I could enjoy the laugh, but alas not really.  Still, Gackt + Pontiac = needs better taste in cars.  Or something like that.  Hah.  I'm probably more amused by this than I should be.  Kinda like finding that picture of Gackt beside an Aston Martin Vanquish in the colour that Dave wanted.  ^_^  Ahahaha, I should be doing something more productive than this.

<lj-cut text=""Poor bastards.""><i>Over the years, scientists have proposed several theories for how ants find their way home.

One is that they do it like honeybees and remember visual cues, but <b>experiments revealed ants can navigate in the dark and even blindfolded.</b> Another disproved hypothesis was that because ants scurry at a steady pace, they could time how long it took them to get to and fro. Other studies have shown that once ants find a good source of food, they teach other ants how to find it.

The ant ""pedometer"" technique was first proposed in 1904, but it remained untested until now.

Scientists trained desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis, to walk along a straight path from their nest entrance to a feeder 30 feet away. If the nest or feeder was moved, the ants would break from their straight path after reaching the anticipated spot and search for their goal.

Next, the researchers performed a little cosmetic surgery.

<b>They glued stilt-like extensions to the legs of some ants to lengthen stride. The researchers shortened other ants' stride length by cutting off the critters' feet and lower legs, reducing their legs to stumps.</b>

<img alt=""Poor Bastards"" src=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/sci_nat_enl_1151658617/img/1.jpg"">

By manipulating the ants' stride lengths, the researchers could determine whether the insects were using an odometer-like mechanism to measure the distance, or counting off steps with an internal pedometer.

<b>The ants on stilts took the right number of steps, but because of their increased stride length, marched past their goal. Stump-legged ants, meanwhile, fell short of the goal.</b>

After getting used to their new legs, the ants were able to adjust their pedometer and zero in on home more precisely, suggesting that stride length serves as an ant pedometer.</i></lj-cut>

First off, why in the hell does anyone <i>care</i> about how ants find their way home?  Why aren't these scientists doing something more worthwhile like curing fucking cancer or other diseases?  

Of course, that aside, it makes me wonder: Just how in the hell do you <i>blindfold an ant</i>?  And other questions I never thought I would ponder in life.  And what do ant stilts look like?  I'd love to see a picture of that, but how do you get them on?  Ant legs aren't exactly big.  I just feel bad for the ones that got their little feet cut off, poor things.  Seriously messed up stuff there.

Other than that, there really isn't a lot to report.  Things have been relatively quiet and I've just been busy with studying and working for my dad. Been under the weather (which is why you didn't hear from me Nick -- I basically slept through your visit >_<), but otherwise hanging in there.  Hope all is well for everyone else out there."

"event","So today started out real fun for me.  I had to go get blood drawn because my doctor is a frickin' sadist who literally went, ""Ooo!  Blood test!"" and started eagerly filling out the form, despite my rather adament protest.  ""It'll be fun!"" is what she literally said to me.  For those who know me, it is not fun, I hate doing it, and it tends to leave me quite dead for about a week.  Combine that with the fact that I am PMSing like it's my full time job and that if they had waited a few days, I would have plenty to give to them on my own without needles, that's just perfect.

I have to wait and wait and wait, which is quite unusual for them.  Normally you walk in and you're taken back.  So of course, no reading material or music and I just have to sit there.  Then the guy that is the only person who doesn't freak me out, turns out he no longer works there.  So I get this nice girl who talks to me and it doesn't hurt too badly, so I'm thinking, okay.

I finally get to have my first Diet Coke after the ordeal and my father and I are going to take pictures of some guy's house for insurance purposes for my mother.  And what happens?  We get fucking rear-ended.

Just fucking sucks, I tell you.  Fucking sucks.

Thankfully she was nice, no one was injured, and the damage wasn't too terrible.  But just not what was needed today.  Then we finally get to go to the guy's house after the three cop cars show up and do nothing about the accident, and it turns out he's some paranoid mafia guy who wants us off of his property.  Wheeee.

Get home and turns out the woman has bruised me all kinds of crazy so now I look like a really shitty needle junkie.  Not been a good day thus far.  Not good at all and I've only been up for about two hours.  Goddamn."

"event","I'm having a good laugh at my father's expense, currently.  See, I've been trolling eBay recently which is always a dangerous thing.  I've recently acquired an almost 500 page book on Gackt from Amazon.co.jp compiling all the articles published in the UV magazine from 1999-2004 for quite a reasonable price, considering that the three that have sold on American eBay went for $112, $153, and another $100ish.  My $40 import + shipping seems not so bad considering it's such a heavy ass 500 page book and what the others paid for it.  

Of course, that leads me to discover that there's a Malice Mizer version dating back from 1997 to 2001, which I also wanted (of course, since I'm obsessive like that, goddamn Gotta-Catch-Them-All! mentality), but couldn't get anyone to mail it from Japan.  Found some on eBay, but one was $90 and another was $54.99, neither of which I really wanted to pay, for obvious reasons, among which is the fact I no longer have a regular job, although I am working for my dad, and paying that much for a magazine/book thing just is too hard for me to bring myself to do.  Even though I start arguing that it saves the cost of buying each individual magazine, to which I counterargue that I would never actually do that.  

But there was one that was on auction that was stagnated at $19.50, so I thought I'd wait that one out and see what it went for.  Even if it went for around $40, I could still technically justify that.  Fastforward six days later and down to the last two hours, when the price jumps up to $26 and irks me.  So I figure, may as well try bidding now to get an idea of the price range.  I bump it all the way up to $38 before the brain kicks in and tells me to stop as I keep getting outbidded automatically.  I take it up to $45 during the last hour and am once again outbidded.  It makes me a sad panda, to say the least.  I thought about taking it all the way up to the $54.99, figuring that way if I won, it's the same price that I would have paid for the other one, and if I still didn't win, then he had to pay more than I would have been willing to put up, so that would be okay.

Thankfully, I listened to the logical part of myself and went downstairs to distract myself from watching the last fifteen minutes of bidding.  I start muttering at my parents about it, but comfort myself in the fact that I have someone else looking for a copy for me, although I'm concerned about the pricing of such a matter, which is what I was mostly talking about, joking about the pun on doing my bidding (auction vs. minion).  So my father, bless his heart and partially bored/curious, decides to look at what I've bidded on, deciding he can't make head or tails of it.  We're down to the last four minutes or so, and my father goes through the log in process (which is so slow because it's on a moody Pintsized), wanting to see what raising it a dollar would do.  Why, I don't know, other than the fact that we figured the max bid was around $50 and I had been automatically outbidded each time.  So he raises it by one dollar...only to have me become highest bidder.  And in that two minutes, the other person never bid again -- turns out they were in France and most likely asleep.  Thus, I won something I thought I had no shot at getting.

The look on his face was absolutely priceless.  He just kept staring at the screen and alternating between ""That wasn't supposed to happen!"" to ""It was just a dollar!  How did that win the damn thing?"" to my personal favourite of, ""What in the hell did I just buy you?  Why do they all look like women?  Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a lesbian and I just bought you some weird-ass imported porn or something?""  ::laughs::  My poor father.  Thus, my father bought me a Malice Mizer book and that will never fail to make me laugh.  But hey, at least I wasn't a dick and jacked up the price to $55 to prove a point, screwing myself over in the process, although that's little comfort to my father, who has no one to blame but himself for this one. ^_^  ""What in the hell possessed me to do that?  I swear, you've corrupted me....""  My poor, poor padre; my mother is busting his balls over this one.  I just can't wait to see his reaction when it actually comes in the mail since it's filled with pictures that are all so very visual kei.  And femme.  Oh so men femme.

I just keep telling him that it will all be useful in learning the language since now it gives me even more material to work with in translating (like I needed any more....).  My application has been processed for the main program, so now I'm just waiting to hear the word and if accepted, get a second packet to fill out to go with the third that came first, and I'm golden and ready to go.  So surreal, but that's the way things have been working recently."

"event","I'd write more, but I am l'tired.  In sum, I am most likely quitting my job today.  I don't exactly like the idea since I don't have a fallback job, but I can't take it anymore; my boss is acting like my ex-boyfriend right before he dumped me, ironically, around this same time to boot.  It just keeps making my anger level flare up and I'd rather not have to deal with it.  I'm more worried about upsetting my dad than my boss about leaving and since my father was the one that suggested it, I guess I can't feel too concerned, right?  So we'll see how that goes since I'm owed over seven hundred dollars....I just keep saying, ""This is what happens when I leave academia....""  It's just so much easier to move there, so much more fulfilling.

In my other news, I'm just waiting for the word.  Thankfully I sent out my transcript post-grades since my GPA is now a 3.808 -- boosted by two A's, but drug down from an 3.81something by two A-'s.  Still, A's, go me.  My mind still can't process those numbers.  But if I quit, it just gives me more time to study, right?  I'm itching to get out of here, I'd be lying if I said otherwise; now that I'm this close, if it falls through, I'm going to be more than just a little disappointed.

So now it's the waiting game.  Trying to figure out how much stuff I can sell to make money until I find another job, because if the above goes through, then I'm going to need teh_money.  Gotta support the raving fangirl habit and possible attempts at a side trip since I miss my Lily-sama dearly.  I want Uno's too and quality you time as well.  Hang in there.  ::huggles::

"event","Sitting there at Lily's graduation, a lot of thoughts were going through my mind.  Approaching it, the world felt a little unreal, what with a man floating inside of a bubble and all the cameras and lights around; these graduates had spent years doing things for this recognition, and yet he spends a few days submerged in water and that garners more interest, which is so typical of America, really.  But that was really an afterthought.  Because as I was sitting there, listening to the speakers and observing the crowd (which included Apolo Anton fucking Ono, oh that was fun indeed), it dawned on me: shit, that's me next year.  Instead of sitting and waiting to recognize her, it will be me sitting there waiting to be recognized by my parents.  I've got a year to wait to be mortified by their reactions, but it goes beyond that, of course.

In a year, where will I be?  If things go well, then it will be at a grad school persuing something that I hope makes me happy, something that leads me somewhere, gives me a purpose in this life.  And if not?  Maybe going abroad again.  But what kinds of thoughts will be running through my head then?  Sitting there wishing I wasn't roasting under those frickin' bright purple robes, but beyond that.  I don't think I'll feel excited, but I doubt I'll feel very relieved either, nor anything close to being terrified.  Uncertain.  But that's to be expected.  But what comes next?  

I know I haven't made the most out of my career at this school.  I got a 3.789GPA without even bothering to try; if I had tried, actually put in effort like I did this semester, would it be higher?  When one of the speakers was announced to have a 3.8whateverGPA, they applauded, but I should hit that point by senior year.  It's bizarre to consider that.  And it's something I have to keep reminding myself, because I keep thinking I'm a concieted asshole wanting to apply to Harvard, Yale, Duke, Princeton (shoot me), Cornell, Brown....I mean, just who the fuck am I?  To think that I could pull that off?  

But then I keep looking at my transcript going, surely I'm qualified?  Especially if this program works out and I can get close enough to being more than just proficient, then it would be okay, right?  But by that same token, I don't feel as if I deserve it, not because of the ""I'm not good enough"" issue, but the fact that it's all be too damn easy.  The only class I should have busted a sweat for was the only one I didn't give a damn about and that was the science class, which I got a D in only by the saving grace of my eloquent appeal and health situation.  Until this semester, I did no reading, just turned in the assignments, and was even proud of that to a degree.  But I still feel like an asshole when I watch people bust their asses to just get an A or B, struggle to get a C, and I just breeze through it.  I keep going, just what is it exactly that I'm doing differently?   

It's why I want to stay in academia as long as humanly possible, simply because it is easy, but at least it's more fulfilling now.  I still feel as if I've wasted a lot of my time and my father's money to get to that point, but hey, at least I hit it, right? I just don't feel like I've earned anything, I guess.  That it's all been too easy.  That someone is going to pull back the curtain and reveal what a fraud I really am, or something like that.  I just keep thinking that I'm not this intelligent, that there has to be some catch somewhere.  Like getting rejected from all the graduate schools.  In a sick way, that would make me feel like, hey see, you're not so fucking smart after all.  Because apparently I need an abusive blow job like that to my pride?  Hah.

I just love how I'm concerned over this when I really should be focused more on what's going to happen this week and about the program.  Because a lot rides on that, since if it falls through, then I have to put off graduate school, most likely.  What's the point in applying if I can't meet the language requirement, you know?

Then it starts making me think about what happens if I do get it, if all of this really becomes reality.  My grandparents will, well my grandfather at least, will probably make all sorts of statements and comments as a result of that West Virginia disapproval of foreigners.  I can only imagine what they would say if they knew how attractive I found them to be....at least with the one ""foreigner"" I've dated, he was white and spoke perfect English, but if I ever brought home a Japanese guy, oi.  My grandmother would come around if he was nice, but my grandfather, I have the feeling would make comments about WWII and kamikaze pilots.  ::sighs::  And as for the rest of the family...Kaitlin would be happy for me, but Bryan would resent it like everything else and make it a money issue, Jordan would think it awesome, and Ben probably wouldn't give a shit.  But overall, the extended family wouldn't understand it, or care to.  

I just keep thinking back to my grandfather's funneral where was getting all different rations of shit about me and my life: ""Why do you need to go to college?  Just come back and marry a nice boy from West Virginia and have kids.  What more could you want?""  ""Why go to some place like NYU when you could go to WVU?  It's a good school to, you know.""  ""You're just a young girl, what are you doing going off to some place like New York City?""  ""What a waste of money it'll be to send you to a place like that, when you could save it all and settle down and have kids!""  And she thought NYU only cost five thousand a <i>year</i>.  If I told her that was one class, I think she would have up and died right then and there.  How to explain to these people that I want to go half way around the world?  How do you make people who have never flown on an airplane, who have never left their state, hell have never moved outside of their hometown, how do you make them understand this desire?  To travel, to experience things abroad, to learn about everything, I was always met with, ""Why do you need to leave to do that?  Seems like an awful waste of time if you ask me.  They don't have anything to teach you that's worth learning.""  I mean, come <i>on</i> now.  When they hear ""China"" and it is a plate rather than a country to them, I get disturbed by that.

I don't want to be ignorant, I don't want to stay put in any one place, I want to see all of these (well, most) places that I've read about, that I've studied.  There is more to life than West Virginia or New Jersey and I'll be damned if I stay tied down to either one of those places.  I hate that I will be resented by some people for actually putting myself out there, for taking this chance and any others that come my way down the line.  Why should I have to feel guilty for wanting to follow my heart on this and if I happen to find success there, all the better, but why should I feel that guilt?  Especially now that I am working for it, that I do want it and will do anything to make these things happen.  I will work my ass off for this and why shouldn't I take pride in that, enjoy it for what it is?  Because this won't be easy, and if it were, I wouldn't be satisfied with it.  Or rather, I wouldn't be satisfied with myself.  I took living for granted for far too long and now that I'm awake, so to speak, I'll be damned if I going to just lie there and let the world keep passing me by.

Because I realized as I sat there, my thoughts broken up by the random cheering and applause, I was happy for her and happy for the way things are, but happy that there will be positive changes in the future for all of us.  And even though we don't know what's ahead, it's okay.  Because while I can't say that everything will be good and wonderful, everything happens for a reason, and if it sucks it will eventually be useful, even if just something to spur me on out of pure spite.  But I didn't feel apprehension about the fact that the future will occur, so much as just generally wondering what is to become of it all.  I think it's telling that it didn't leave me depressed or anxious, that I left there with a genuine smile on my face and happy for it all.  Yes things have been shit at this school, but it grants me a perspective that will serve me well in the future, even if it is a bit of a sarcastic angle."

"event","I just finished reading the play, <i>Stuff Happens</i> by David Hare.  I can't remember the last time I felt so completely and utterly disgusted with this country, its leaders, the whole fucking world and its behaviour.  It inspires a rage that is all the more frustrating because nothing can be done, there's nothing that will change anything, and this is how it's always been, and how it will continue to be.  We are the Romans, just waiting for the fall that they believe will never come.  Such blindness!  I do not like this feeling, and I am eternally grateful that I am not seeing it this Sunday because I don't think that I could have sat there.  It's one thing to read the words on the page, reading how current history has played out, but it's another thing to see it.  To see representations of things that happened, to hear the words spoken.  The words that just make me more livid than I ever expected possible.  But where do you go when the whole world is eight shades of fucked up, you know?  I'm used to feeling a sort of apathy toward this country, but goddamn.  I'm thinking I really shouldn't talk too much in class tomorrow.  Because between <i>The Laramine Project</i> and this play, it just proves all the more reminder that people fucking suck and this world is just shit made even worse by fucknuts who claim its in our ""best interest.""

Plus the suitemates are being real assholes.  They have all kinds of people over here, and I got fed up and slammed the door after taking a bathroom break to prove a point, basically saying, ""Shut the fuck up, or else,"" without using words.  Of course, what do they do?  <i>Slam the doors constantly every time someone comes in and out of the room.</i>  Goddamn bitches.  I fucking hate them.  So much.  I'm going to be so glad when I don't have to live with them anymore, when they will be nothing more than material for story entertainment.  Goddamn.

Honestly, I really haven't been this ragey all day.  I've mostly been out of it.  But I need sleep and it's just not going to happen, especially given the noise level of those two and their little party of people who piss me off.  Again, it makes me want to get in the shower, and start having the most incredible, noisy sex ever.  Just to prove a point.  But, no.

The only upshot is that my schedule for next semester is looking pretty doable now that I've dropped out of the class about the meaning of silence with the teacher who, according to the all-knowing Lily-sama, is a self-righteous fuckwit who believes in group work, probably only because it allows for more people to stroke her ego at once.

MW: 11.00AM-12.25PM World War II
MW: 02.00PM-03.15PM Writing About Popular Music
W:  03.30PM-06.10PM Culture as Communication
R:  06.20PM-09.00PM Contemporary Aesthetics and Cultural History

Not too thrilled about the 11AM class, but given that it's a, better than anything else offered and b, it's not as bad getting up for me beause of work, I think it'll be okay.  It's not like an 8/9AMer, you know?  Plus, it sounded interesting because it wasn't just an examination of the battles, but of the personalities of figures, the culture that was an effect and affected by the war, plus using music, art, and film to further show things, which I think is pretty cool.  And hey, no class on Tuesday.  Of course, that means my work schedule would be Monday's from 3.30PM-whenever, Tuesdays from 10AM-whenever, Thursdays from 10AM-5PM, and Friday from 10AM-whenever.  Potentially, anywhere from 25-30+ hours a week, which while good for the pay...<i>ugh</i>.

I think I'm going to take a shower now, though.  Maybe it'll get them to shut the fuck up, but I doubt it."

"event","So I thought I'd reward myself for my paper and celebrate my non-anniversary.  Went to Kinokuniya's and was flipping through some magazines at random.  There's one called <i>Barefoot</i> and when I picked it up to see what that was all about, something that I thought was an insert, turned out to be this week's <i>Oricon Style</i> magazine, featuring Gackt.  Now here's the thing, having seen shots of the inside, I wanted it and had ordered it off of a website, but I figured, I may as well buy it.  Since it's a weekly magazine, most stores don't carry it.  And when I got home, it turns out they couldn't get it so my order had been cancelled.  Needless to say, there was a happy dance done in my chair (not to mention in the store).  

I also went down to Book-Off and bought some stuff.  Got two more volumes of <i>Kugutsu</i> which I never thought I'd find, along with the last three volumes of <i>Wild Act</i>, which means I only need volume one to have the whole series.  Plus, I got the last two volumes of <i>Zettai Kareshi</i> and finished that series up, too.  Then I got something which I'm so glad I caved and bought.  It's an official release of <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i>, focusing on Kaoru.  There are interviews, <i>plushie patterns</i>, and more merchandise fun, so I figured, why the hell not, it's not like I'll ever find it again.  

So I'm flipping through it once I get home, laughing at some of the shorts contributed by various mangaka who are fans of the series, and then I'm going, ""Ah, hmm, yes Gackt in his Malice Mizer days, how lovely, <i>Fuku o nugi yokotawaru sugata ni inori o sasagete/You take of your clothes and I offer a prayer to your prostrate form</i>, eheehee....wait, <i>what</i>?""  So it turns out I wasn't hallucinating Gackt and Malice Mizer in the middle of this manga (while mentally singing <i>Illuminati</i> which came up on Party Shuffle in the middle of all of this), but they actually had Mana (of all frickin' people) write an essay about what anime means to him and his thoughts on the series.  Turns out he's a <i>Gundam</i> fan, something that I suspect Gackt is responsible for, and he likes Asuka's design.  Go figure.  At one point he starts talking about Nike shoes, which, when I tried picturing Mana in sneakers had me laughing my ass off, because that's pretty funny.  Which makes me think of the Malice Mizer photoseries where they all dress up as trailer trash in overalls, making breakfast.  Somehow the show had an effect on the band, although I need to do a closer reading (meaning, get my damn glasses so I can fucking <i>see</i> the text) to find out exactly how.  The only thing that would have made it better was if Gackt had written the essay, but hey, he's at least the main focus of the picture.

Still, given how much I bought, I barely spent thirty bucks, which is impressive considering ten of that went to a <i>Pati Pati</i> magazine.  Fluency is expensive. ^_^;;  But, it's pretty cool, because now they actually talk to me in Japanese, whereas before I got weird looks and broken English.  The downside is sometimes I think I'm full of shit, because after last night were the last ten minutes of the Chinese film obliterated my ability to speak or think (when I meant empty, I meant fucking <i>empty</i>, devoid of anything) and the movie tonight, which was a Western where everyone spoke with Southern accents and I felt like it was a foreign language when it is closer to my ""natural tongue"" than any other language.  No one else seemed to have problems understanding it, but I was struggling for some really weird reason.  But hey, it is what it is.  And it gives me shit to bring home over the weekend since my parents just assumed that I was coming home and I don't really feel up to disappointing them, even though I'm home next weekend as well.  So, yay?"

"event","That was relativly painless, actually.  And I even mentioned to talk about the Oricon charts, even though I couldn't slide Gackt in there without a significant stretch of the imagination, not to mention it's completely inappropriate for the film.  Ah well.  Just need to read it over in the morning, and add two more works cited things and I'm good to go once I print it out, which is great.  Although I think I'm still not going to class until my night class to turn in the essay.  And if I wake up, maybe I'll go uptown.  We'll see how it goes.  But for now, sleep at a relatively decent hour, and an excellent one for having just completed a ten page paper."

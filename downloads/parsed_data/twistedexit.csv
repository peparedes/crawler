"event","<i>""Trying hard to forget that cold October day, when Love challenged Freedom to a fist fight. freedom looked victorious; but no one was expecting the outcome on that baseball diamond... When Love reached beneath her plaid jumper, pulled out a switch blade, and drove it... Directly through the heart of St. Angeles.""</i> -Alexisonfire

last night was fun. i remembered today that i had caffiene, which is why i stayed up even later to write this memory poem:
<b>my ears are still ringing from the sound of tonight.
mosh pits, and mascara again.
lights and hugs and sandales with backup dancers and electrical tape.
multicoloured drum stands and hats that are so big that they cover your eyes.
and the engergy.
full of boys with fancy hair, blonde hair. they all look so nice.
and the drummer's chest, and that guy who shat his pants in the crowd.
no leather boots tonight. pink instead.
there's talk of the girl who everyone wants. 
i don't notice, because i can't remember whose arms i was last
nobody notices. we're all dancing! </b> 

by me."

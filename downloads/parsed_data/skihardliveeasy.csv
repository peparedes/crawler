"event","so ive seen napoleon dynamite three times now. its pretty much the greatest movie ever made. if anyone wants to go see it let me know ill go with. summer school ended. it actually went by later then i thought it would. on the last day of summer school we had to build boats and we got points depending on the distance the boat travelled. so thursday after school alex and i were like, shit, we need to build our boats. so we went to home depot and got a bunch of supplies, like we actually looked like construction dudes with our cart full of stuff. i bought 20 feet of pvc pipe some metal rods and a caulking gun with and some silicone caulk. then we get to alexs house and i was sawing away at the pvc pipe. i cut it into 6 three foot pieces and then i made 2 equilateral triangles with three foot sides. i taped the two triangles together with a bottle between them at the three points. I then took the two remaining feet of pvc and taped them it to the bottom to attach my propellers. so then i tried to build my propellers out of broken cd's but i sucked at that and i ended up ""borrowing"" mark huhs propeller. so when i went to race my boat it was too heavy and wouldnt move so ended up taking it all apart and taping two bottles to a piece of pipe and putting a propeller underneath. so bascially i could have built my boat in five minutes. marked save my ass. alex's boat story is even funnier. he spent 12 hours on a boat that sunk like a rock. hell have to tell you about it.

"event","where was i, ahh yes, fireworks. things like that are soo much cooler when your young. when everything is magic, whats a more entertaining explanation magic fire in the sky or a calculated chemical reaction. being five was the shit, a time when being able to touch your toes made you a bad ass. who stole the cookies from the cookie jar, was it me, damn straight. duck duck goose, a game consisting of only two words could entertain for minutes, and being smaller minutes were a lot bigger. i was assessing all my skills, because girls like guys with skills. and i realized im not good with nunchucks or any martial art stuff, which ive learned to accept, but i also realized im a bad dancer, well not really realized ive always known it. anyway i think i should learn to dance. i really dont know what point i was driving at there. i have a question. does anyone know what incandescent means? if someone could tell me that would really help me out.

"event","its been a long while since ive last writtne on here. that must mean i have a lot to talk about. not so much. the concept of summer school astounds me, and the fact that i have allowed myself to participate in it dissapoints me. my id is bored stiff. class is awful school is awful and summer is the time absent of all that so i decided to be consistent and put some school into my summer. i was going to think of a good analogy, but i dont think there is anything that idiotic to compare it too. ap's came in, i did pretty well, all the chem guys got 5's. i own barry burns now which is awesome. ive been playin alot of piano and writing some more songs. napoleon dynamite was awesome. everyone must go see that movie. anchorman was disspointing. i got one of those blockbuster unlimited rental thingies, so im gonna try and catch up on all the movies i missed. i put one of those picture thingies in my live journal so everyone can gaze at me. i sometimes ask people who i look like, hoping to get someone attractive or at least famous. the best ive ever done is ashton kutcher but those came from a guy who wanted money and my therapist who wants me to feel good. i get the friends people alot, mostly ross. i was at a party and i guy said you look like someone from the ninja turtles, so immediatley i jumped to jason the hockey player guy with long hair, he said no, so i thought shredder and april are the only other two humans in taht show so i went with shredder, again no. he was like you remember the rat guy, and i said oh you mean splinter, and he said yeah thats it!. this brings me to a conclusion the other character i get compared to alot is alf. if one were to look at alf and splinter one would notice alot of similarities, both are brown creatures with lots or brown hair and large noses. upon drawing this conclusion the natural thought progression lead to suicide, but i rebounded. i went to the rush concert with james that was alot of fun. one of the best shows ive been too. 4th of july was at julia's that was pretty fun. except fireworks are fire works, i mean at 5 they are cool but then seeing them year after year one begins to notice they all kind of look the same. I just noticed i am writing alot, so here ends part one of my saga. Part 2 will be posted in prolly like 5 minutes.

"event","last night i decided to go to see President Reagan's casket. after about three hours in a car my mother and i finally arrived at the moorpark college at about 1030 and got in line. we made friends with the people around us. the next 8 hours i was in line talking with all types of people all with the same intent of honoring the president. at about 630 we finally got on the bus which took us to the Reagan Library where reagan's casket was on display. it was guarded by five military personnel, and it was an impressive sight to see i must say. we finally got back to our car aroun 730. it is now 830 and i have not slept in almost 30 hours but it was well worth it because i will never be able to experience something like that in my life. i talked to Gary Bryant on KEarth 101.1 and i was put on the air. who knows what my plans for today are.

"event","sinc i have last updated many things have happned. i went to the mayfield senior prom with katie, it was an awesome time. everyone looked wonderful. the people that i was in the limo with were all fantastic people. i dont remember much of what happened after prom but my resources tell me i had fun. the following week there was kairos LVI. this was without a doubt one of the most memorable experiences of my life. i can't say what happened but i can say i learn alot more about myself and the people around me. alot of people who i didnt like so much became my closest friends. the saturday after kairos i went to my old enemy new friend matt antoun's birthday party, another one of my newly made kairos brothers joey thor was there. i guess i looked the oldest so we went to go buy alcohol but that didnt work so well. then we went to scotty's where we thought it would be funny to beat up the other christian and throw him in the trunk of his own car while we drove around. it turns out he didnt find that as funny as we did, although the trunk is pretty comfortable. the next morning i went to the nixon library with my mom's class, woo hoo.
this past tuesday i had a scout meeting and then played texas holdem with some tattooed scary looking guys. thursday i went to this performance at my moms school which was pretty cool. last night i had piano my 2nd and 3rd piano lessons in 2 days. afterwards i went to the house of blues to see The Falllwater Project. it was an 18+ show so i was too afraid to try and sneak in, but my crazy mom made them let me in. if youve ever been to a show where you are underaged, they make you sit in this really small corner and you cant go anywhere else. once again with the help of my mom, she talked to the security guard while i ran past him to go down to the dance floor. the show was awesome, seeing professional musicians is something else. i met some new drinking age friends one of which bought me a beer, thanks sean. i always started dancing with some older personas till i realized my mom was there too and that was just akward. it is now saturday night and i am bored off my ass because i dont have a license or any friends that want to see me.

"event","alot of crap has happened since i have last journalized. friday was tight, happy birthday jake. we went to taylor's party and it was pretty fun, tim fimpler is the craziest drunk. actually not really hes pretty much the same all the time, except his dancing skills improve greatly. then came saturday. i had a swim meet in the morning pretty fun, edmunds beat me though which is not so fun. then gina's party. it was a lot of fun. i had a really good time met alot cool people and a lovely young lady, whose name i will keep secret in order to prevent the embrassment of being associated with myself. the cops came, and i tried to act sober, i even talked to the cop i think. my mom picked me up she was cool with the situation. sunday i called gina in the morning to give my condolances, and ask her if she needed help. however she wasnt there so i talked to her big bro eugene who told me she didnt need any help, cause he wanted her to do all the work. i also talked to pat who i was happy to hear was in a much better state. sunday night i saw my buddy james bank's band play at the whiskey. go zuke. i hung out at mitchells gf house later sunday night with bethany and vanessa. all in all it was an eventful weekend. im feeling not to shitty right now, which is an improvement. im still in search for a prom date. big test tomorrow and need to start studying. i was kind of an asshole to some people this weekend, and i want to say im sorry to anyone that fits underneath that category.

"event","last night i had two tests to study for and some spanish hw to do. chem wasnt too bad because i kind of knew what to do but not really. then there was english, well i found out last night i had lost my 80 dollar english book. well not really mine, its actually one i stole from a kid because i lost my first 80 dollar english book the first month of school. i know what youre thinking only assholes steal book. well guess what. im an asshole. then there was spanish, i was tired said fuck it and hoped someone would print me out a copy this morning. so i got to school this morning was studying some more for my tests and then, holy crap! spanish hw. so i ran to the library paid a kid 2 dollars to print me out an extra copy. well this kid was retarded and put my copy on my desk right in front of the teacher during spanish class. so he caught us. luckily hes a chill guy so he didnt tell the dean. so i took my chem test and did alot shittier then i thought i would, but then again im alot dumber then i think i am. then off to the enlgish test. WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT TEST ABOUT. we read a poem and the author says ""my soul is a bird"" then the question asks to identify the metaphor however NONE OF THE 5 CHOICES SAY SOUL OR BIRD in them. another question quoted the first for lines of the poem and asked us to explain the last six. so that test blew. swimming was alright, pretty easy cause i only did breast stroke. catherine decided to stop by and watch me swim, thats mighty nice of her. this weekend will be tight though, and if i isnt i blame all my friends.

"event","today seemed like it was going to be a good day. i swam moderately fast for once (i didnt get lapped). then i started off the day with ap chem with mr torres. we had a quiz that i thought i did pretty well on. it turns out i got a 77% which is a B in that class so im happy. then he went to check our hw, someone, barry burns, did not have his hw. this send mr t in to a cuban psychotic rage translating into a pop quiz. well i didnt want to get a 0 so i just put some calculations on paper and prayed id get a point or two. turns out i got not one but 5 points,out of 25. content with my 20% i finished out the rest of the school day tired as hell. then when school ended i went to meet my dad who was going to take me to my chem tutor, but his car broke down, so instead i served my detention that i had planned to serve later, and bummed a ride with a philipino kid with bad acne. its now almost 7 30 and i havent done shit and i have two tests tomorrow.

"event","over the past week ive been getting a heavy dose of jesus. at the beginning of the week i bought the soundtrack to jesus christ superstar, for those of you who havent seen of heard it is one of the best musicals ever. then after listening to it over and over, i thought why cant i sing and play those songs. so i went to the music store and bought myself the sheet music. then tonight i saw the passion of the christ. let me say that this movie was phenomenal, but very hard to watch. having the emotionally stability of a 10 year old girl the scourging scenes in this movie were tough to go through. jim cavaziel, the man who played jesus did such a fantastic job acting that at times i didnt even realize it was an actor, i felt like i was actually viewing jesus. my reccomendation is that everyone go see this movie.

"event","wow. today was a reallly long day. swimming practice would have been alot easier if i were faster, and the pool wasnt so long. i almost forgot why i hated my water polo coach but he reaffirmed my hatred rather easily by being a worse swim coach then a water polo coach. the rest of the day was going by smoothly, until calculus. i took the hardest test of my life today and i studied forever. i also played and sang alot of jesus christ superstar. i know what your thinking, he listens to musicals, he must be gay, and you just might be right. another thing i have no clue what to give up for lent. someone help me.

"event","this is my first post on this thing so its guaranteed to be pointless. im not even sure if this is going to work. today was a pretty ok. swimming was alright. i almost fell asleep at mass. holy crap i hope all my posts arent this boring. am i really this uninteresting. i should have other people right this for me, they always seem to remember the idiotic things i do on a daily basis while i somehow forget. i didnt put my speedo on backwards today, i guess thats pretty exciting, although the thought of me in a speedo is even more exciting. i think thats it.

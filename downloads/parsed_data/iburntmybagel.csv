"event","the black hole has sucked me in again and im not sure what to do...  my best friend is about to ruin her life and im so scared for her...  i tried talking to her but she just got mad at me... ive lost my best friend who am i going to turn to now... i have no one to talk to... im all alone... my boyfriend just hung up on me when i was balling... which makes me feel like even more shit.. i feel like dying... i stopped cutting months ago, but i couldnt resist the earge of the sharp blade running across my pale skin.. so as the blood trickled down my wrist, leg and arm, the feeling of relief i had longed for didnt come.. instead im numb, numb to the world, numb to all of this bullshit that is going on in my life...i feel like laying in bed all day long crying and staring at the wall... wow i sound emo... maybe i am... nahh i havent sunk that low

"event","well ive actually got free time on my hands now.. so i can write about my o-so interesting life... um... so ive been in hickville usa (ie northern louisiana) visiting my family... its kinda funny everytime we get together we have some big fight, just over trivial stuff... for example our intelectually stunted president... so to prevent, delay rather because the fight is inevitable, we play board games... so all week ive been playing cranium... which is a kickass game... oh yeah and i got the pleasure of taking care of my drunken mom... she made me her designated driver after she killed an entire bottle of eggnog... which meant that i had to pick her drunk ass up off the couch and drag her to the car at 2 am... it kinda sucked, but at the same time it was funny... cuz my mom is pretty fuckin stupid when she is drunk, god i hope im not like that...  anyways... so now im back in new orleans and looking for shit to do... im so bored, my boyfriend is stupid... before i went to work we specifically made plans for me to see him after work, because ive been out of town and all... so all during work i think i have plans, you know i had something to actually look forward to... so all during work im like ""im gonna get off and smoke a bowl and hang out with shanon""... so when i get off he had left me a messege saying that he was gonna stay uptown... so now im pissed and im considering becoming a lesbian... i wouldnt be mad if we hadnt made plans to begin with... but he HAD to get my hopes up... which sucks because im the type of person who expects the worse, because when better things come its that much better and when the worst comes your just like thats what i expected... you know as soon as i led my guard down shit like this happens... yeah i know its not that big of a deal and i should suck it up and quit bitching but whatever, so are reading MY journal so you must wanna hear me bitch"

"event","Do you ever get that perpetual numbness... it engulfs you brain untill you can barely think any optomistic thoughts.. i wouldnt describe it as depression, because when im depressed im like fucking crazy... but right now im like ~blah~ thats right if ~blah~ were a feeling thats what i would feel like... i think that this may be associated with boredom, and how it make you think about all of you negative attributes and how others really see you... for anyone who really knows me they should know im not the type of person who cares about what just anyone thinks of me... but what really gets to me and makes it hard for me to have any sort of close relationship is how i think my friends think of me... like i try not to get close to anyone, because atleast then im garanteed not to get hurt...  i guess this is because of things that have happened to me in the past (things with my family and whatnot- which i will probably get into another day)...  sometimes i get the idea that people think that im just some dazed and happy stoner all the time, honestly thats just my cover to deal with all of the shit that goes on in my life and in my head...god i feel like such a douche broadcasting my personal life on the internet, as if im crying out for attention or something... who knows maybe i am, at this point anything is possible"

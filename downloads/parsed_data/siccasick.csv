IM HAPPY
it's the best feeling to leave everything up to God, it's so hard at first i can't lie, but it's so worth it

i do it with every little thing now and everytime i end up happy, even with my big huge troubles im not trying to force anything..and i think it might be going the direction i want it to (eh hem jula)

speaking of! me and jula have the most amazing moments now they just keep getting better...every time it's just a closer connection 
it's pretty crazy !!!!

Im also getting more comfortable with outside relationships i can't control, and im getting better at accepting people for who they are


woooo hooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

omgosh still not over the superbowl!!!

"event","homecoming was amazing and almost all i could ask for, but people thought it was funny that no one wanted to dance with the homecoming princess...
so i danced with Dina which was amazing. and actually way better than akwardly dancing with a guy. 
the royalty court was a blast i couldnt ask for better people to hang out with, 
and morgan taylor was there to make everything better (as always) 
and i cant forget katie thorpe, pretty much was my light for the whole two days of homecoming. 
the only girl missing was jula. BUMMER. 
Sophomores took second in the float comp! yay! and after wednesday i can have i life again! and
 dude! i got to watch new york minute again i havent watched that since i was like ten! it was awesome haha hope everyone else had a good weekend."

"event","i do not know why i always like the guys i cant have...
and the guys i shouldnt have?
I really believe in the saying ""Good girls always want the bad boys""
i guess its because you want to even things out
good thing i have amazing friends
they make up for every guy i can't have
AND MORE
so i found out one of my best friends, who i wouldve never thought would wanna leave school(because they are soooooo sooo popular) ....really wants to go on independent studies
its weird how many people actually like school its sad we should like it because were getting an education for the rest of our lives
but most of us actually hate it


craziest thing happened today!
okay so..
i really wanna be a photographer 
and today at the fair i stopped by helens photography booth and i talked to her about like how she got into it and she mentioned the school im really interested to going to (which was weird)
and then she was like 
""i just felt like God wanted me to do this..this is my calling"" and she said..that was a weird way of putting it
and i was like omgosh!!! yes!
haha
and then she was like its a good business for people who dont drink and do drugs because most photographers arent into that
and i was like DUDE!! im the same way!
it was really awesome i felt like God spoke to me today
im so glad i talked to her!


well ya that was my day in a nutshell"

"event","it seems like some people are going through rough times right now and really great ones..i think it's interesting how two friends lives' can be so opposite at the same time..and how one month you can be great, and the next everything totally flipped around..one month...thats pretty crazy to me. 
The only thing thats helping me right now is Jesus because alot of my friends can't be around lately, and the ones who can just say things to make matters worse. 
Even though im not at my best right now i'm still keeping faith because i know He is there when I'm not. 
oh i finally learned what the word ""vulnerable"" means ! i never got it but its kinda happening to me right now, ive always wanted to say - i""m really vulnerable right now"" lol i can finally say it! haha...(totally weird)
okay well im out i still have so much hw. 
Sharon - i love you your amazing...hope things get better
Jula - hopefully i will see you soon but idk... im very sad. i love you too!!!

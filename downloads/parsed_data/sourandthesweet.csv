"event","my Horoscope: It's good to keep your ears open, but you should be more selective about what you choose to believe. Can you tell a fact from a rumor? Some truths are too unpleasant to accept and some lies are too seductive to ignore. YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF TAKING STOCK OF YOUR FRIENDSHIPS AND REEXAMINING THEM TO FIND THE REASONS YOU HAVE THEM. Review is healthy in some cases, especially when it helps you remember and settle old debts. On the other hand, worrying too much leaves you distracted and restless. All that you really need is a good book and a few hours of solitude. 

,,,,i lost another one today ,,,, my favorite one too ,,,, oh well

you better have fun with her keith cus im gone ,and the worst thing is if you got in a accident and became a parapalygic , i woulda wiped your fucking ass for you ,,, where ally would be in the other room fucking some friend of yours, its been fun"

<h2>You Are Finger Licking</h2>
Not much for the subtle approach, are you?<br>
You like to let your lover know what's up...<br>
Especially since what's up is your roving tongue.
<br><br>
Maybe your tongue will wander further later - <br>
Or maybe you'll keep your mouth in the safety zone.<br>
Either way, your mouth drives your partner wild.

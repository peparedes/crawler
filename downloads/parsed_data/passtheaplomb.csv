<lj-cut text=""Bored"">

[1.] Where was the first time you ever kissed the last person you kissed?
Right smack bang in the middle of Southern Cross station :)

[2.] Whats the greatest thing that happened to you today?
I improved a lot on my new clarinet.

[3.] How many best friends do you have?
Three?

[4.] Would you rather get up early or sleep in?
Sleep in is what I always do, even though it's not what my body actually likes. Daytime Courtney functions much better when she wakes up early, but nighttime Courtney makes it difficult for her. :P

[5.] Tell me where you got each article of clothing youre wearing?
Um, I'm in my jammies, so the shorts would have been from someplace like Target or Kmart, and the singlet was a hand-me-down from some relative or other.

[7.] What would you change about your life right now?
My motivation. Gotta get me some of that action.

[8.] Would you rather smile over a lie or cry over the truth?
Truth. It's going to hurt you anyway, may as well be honest about it to yourself.

[9.] What's on your bedroom floor right now?
Haha. <i>Everything I own...</i>

[10.] Who was the last person you got into an argument with?
Depends on what you call an argument. I don't think I've had one in ages. I guess Aaron, when I yelled at him because I felt ignored. >_>

[11.] Do you trust people?
Never completely, but I trust almost everyone to some degree.

[12.] If you could move away, no questions asked, where would you move to?
Near to the city. Not because of Aaron, I just think I'd like it there.

[14.] Could you go a day without eating?
Easily.

[15.] How much do looks matter to you?
They're certainly not the most important thing, but they definitely matter quite a bit.

[16.] How do you feel about sex?
Um, I'm certainly not against it. o_O What kind of question is that?

[17.] When was the last time you had your hair cut?
Several forevers ago.

[18.] Would you rather be mad or sad?
Sad. Anger confuses me, I have no idea what to do with it. Sadness I understand.

[19.] Does it take a lot to make you cry?
Depends how relevant it is to me personally. Movies and stuff rarely have any affect, but small things in my own life can get the waterworks going.

[21.] Are you tight with your mom?
We're on good terms, and we have close talks occasionally. We're not super buddies, but it's pretty much all good in that department these days. Phew.

[23.] Do you tell your parents everything?
Hell no!

[24.] Would you rather be a bird or a fish
Birdy!

[25.] Name one fear you have.
That I'll always be alone.

[26.] If you need to go to the store a block away, do you walk or drive?
Walk, of course.

[27.] Does the thought of marriage scare you?
Yes and no.

[28.] How many kids do you want?
None at the moment. Whether or not that'll change in the distant future is anyone's guess.

[29.] What's your favorite color to wear?
Purple/green/brown/orange. I'm That 70's Courtney.

[30.] Who was the last person in your bedroom besides you?
Mum was in the doorway saying goodnight. If you mean all the way in, then Teghan, when she was stealing my Alias DVDs today.

[31.] What are you doing today?
Going to English class, after the sleeping thing.

[34.] What would you do if you found a dinosaur egg?
Sell it to a museum.

[35.] Do you get bored easily?
Yes.

[36.] What's something that someone can do that really bothers you?
Expect me to be interested in tv celebrities, or the personal lives of people I don't even know. Seriously, <i>why would I care!?</i>

[37.] Did you ever want to change your name when you were younger?
Not especially. I don't really like my name, but only because I feel like I can't be summed up as a person by one word, so changing it wouldn't really do much.

[38.] Do you wish you were famous?
Sometimes.

[40.] When you're at the beach do you swim or lay out more?
Swimming. The sun is everywhere, go lie around in your backyard if that's all you're going to do.

[41.] Who's the last text message you received from and what did it say?
From Aaron, saying ""Yay :) roar"" after I told him my mobile was working again. He roars sometimes. It's a thing.

[43.] What's your favorite song at the moment?
I don't have one

[45.] Can music affect your mood?
Very dramatically, yes.

[46.] What piercings do you want?
None, really. I wouldn't mind a couple more in my ears, but meh.

[47.] What tattoos do you want?
Calligraphy scribble thing on my back, if I were to get one.

[48.] Have you ever been in a cave?
Not that I can think of.

[49.] Ever eaten a bug?
Probably :(

[50.] Do you think there's someone for everyone?
Only those that allow it to happen."

"event","Went to Forbes today with my Muuuummy and Teghan. I bought some bras, amazingly enough. And some decent underwear for once. Yes, I get nice undies like a week after breaking up. Whoo! I'm still not brave enough to get a g-string, but I came close today.

I got 4 bras: a pretty lacy purple one, a not-especially-nice strapless brown one, a weirdly shaped tiny pink one with super thin green straps that I'm really starting to like a lot, and a black one with lace on the sides which is actually very dark blue when you look at it in the light. One pair of the undies is black and almost perfectly matches the black bra, and the other is striped with black, dark blue and hot pink, and doesn't really go with any bras but the black one looks ok with it. I wish I had someone to show them to. :(

After Forbes, we went to Aldi, where I was very successfully getting Mum to buy all sorts of junk food that she used to get but stopped for some reason, until Teghan spoiled it. Silly girl. She never had to learn the subtle persuasion thing, since unlike some people, she always just gets stuff. *Sigh* Younger siblings. Oh well, at least I got some doritos and some of the chocolate muesli bars I haven't had for months. Oh and yoghurt, though that doesn't really count as junk food. Not a bad haul for the amount of time I had to work with. :D

Those shopping trolley contraptions at Aldi should be smashed up into little bitty pieces. Preferably by me. Grrr."

"event","Tonight... I hit something. I was crying, as I've been doing on and off for the last two days or so, when all of a sudden, I just stopped. My head felt both clear and muddled at the same time. The crying went away. I could have kept going if I'd made myself, but the desire to cry was just gone. I tried to work out what was different, and then I remembered what the feeling was.

I felt okay.

I mean, I still feel like absolute shit. And tomorrow when I wake up I'm going to feel exactly the same as I did today, and the day before that, and I'm going to keep crying at pretty regular intervals for quite a while to come.

But tonight, just for a couple of hours, I got my okay back. I got my first glimpse of the other side.

So I sat up. I stopped crying, I sat up, and I went on msn, which had been sitting on appear offline for the last couple of hours. And because I felt okay, I got to talk to Aaron for a little while before he went to bed. He'd been on for about half an hour to say hi to me. I wish it had been a bit earlier that it had happened so I could talk longer. I wish I could have told him how much I appreciated him going online, but the words just weren't there. There's a lot that I can't say to him now, which makes me sad.

Right now, I feel okay. I probably won't feel okay again for a while, but it's a really good first step."

"event","I called him tonight. We broke up. I think technically I was the one who broke up with him, but it was only because he left it all up to me. We're still going to be close friends. I'm his best friend, apparently. He'd be mine if the position weren't already filled... I think maybe I've had two best friends for a while now. As I've said all along, before I even knew I had a chance with him, I'd rather be friends with him than nothing at all.

We're still going to hang out. I wouldn't be able to stand not seeing him, and it's silly to ignore each other when neither of us are mad enough to do that or want to do that. There is of course going to be the problem of keeping our hands off each other, so we'll have to, yaknow, <i>do</i> stuff. I'm actually looking forward to that part of it.

"event","New lj made on an early-morning whim. I don't know if it'll stick, but hey, why not? I don't think I'm cut out for the lj experience. Everything with me is so internal that I either don't talk at all, or it's total honesty, no-holding-back, just saying everything that's on my mind. And neither of those things really work well with a journal that other people read. Of course, I could just talk about boring things, but who wants to read that? I certainly don't want to write about everyday stuff.

I brushed my hair today. Twice. Overall, there were 57 brush strokes. It was so exciting.

I didn't actually. I didn't brush my hair at all today. Aren't I just a wild and crazy kidder? You never know what'll happen next around me, I'm so spontaneous and interesting. Look out, before you know it you'll be caught up in one of my elaborate and extraordinarily hilarious jokes, and then there'll be no hope for you at all my friend. Oh no.

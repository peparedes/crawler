yayness
monty python and the holy grail is so cool
that bunny part made me laugh more than any other film.
im typing crap to make me feel better, it aint workin too good. i was walkin home from stayin at jos for about 4 days and walkin home i kept gettin the usual suicidal thoughts and imaginin sayin to a friend over the computer 'i have just slit my wrists i know u dont trust me but if u make the wrong decision i could die or if im lying then u will lokk a fool,' and lots of other scenarios, i was supposed to go councellin again but i didnt go, they kept wafflig on about religion, cack.
I peirced my own lip in the centre at the bottom, and me n jo did my nose yesterday and i peirced jos lip yesterday too.
i cut the side of my back up, i like the way i can feel it when i sleep, i get that weird feeling like adrenaline, like whne i purposly wer shoes which make me bleed and push back on them on purpose, i like the way it makes the back of my foot look. i dont feel the pain as much as i should i tink, i dunno i have never been anyone else but, i cant explain why i do it.
i have7 peircings now, not a lot but im getting there.
i had a nice bath today and i feel so nice after, my skin seems to be a little clearer to me, altho it isnt! i tried that hair remoal stuff, its so fun to play with! the hair coming off looks weird. smells like shite though.
i have write a few poems lately i put em down another time.

i forgot to activate my account so i have to write my entry all over again.
Just like me to balls everything up heh heh.
i think i will have to get used to writing a journal online and see how private i can go with writing things.
Today at Moniques house we were talking about nosebleeds and i realised i had never had the pleasure.
But i may sound like im on crack for a while until i adjust to this whole thing but im sure i will be fine and find this quite amusing.

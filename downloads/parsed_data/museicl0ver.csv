"event","<i>Why risk everything to put a 14-year old in the competition when they could have replaced her with an of-age 16-year old gymnast? Sure, He is a better gymnast than the Chinese gymnasts who were eligible to compete, but with the judges they had at the Olympics, would it really have mattered?</i>

1) I like that last line
2) Read the article. (If you watched any of the women's gymnastics competition then you already know what I'm talking about with my No. 1)

"event","holy fucking shit. 8golds for 8 swims with 8 world records. holy fucking shit. Phelps is the most amazing athlete ever. You can argue the point about anyone else, but NO ONE has done or will probably ever do what Phelps (with the help of his relay team twice) has just done in the past 9 days. I have no more words. I'm not good with words or I'd write more about him but I think what I've said is sufficient."

"event","There are two statues in a park; one of a nude man and one
 of a nude woman.
 They had been facing each other across a pathway for a
 hundred years, when one day an angel comes down from  the sky and, with a single gesture, brings
 the two to life.
  
 The angel tells them, 'As a reward for being so
 patient through a hundred blazing summers and dismal winters,  you have been given life for thirty minutes to do what you've  wished to do the most.'
  
 He looks at her, she looks at him, and they go running
 behind the shrubbery.
  
 The angel waits patiently as the bushes rustle and giggling
 ensues. After fifteen minutes, the two return, out of breath and
 laughing.
  
 The angel tells them, 'Um, you have fifteen minutes
 left, would you care to do it again?'
  
 He asks her 'Shall we?'
  
 She eagerly replies, 'Oh, yes, let's! But
 let's change positions. This time,
 I'll hold the pigeon down and you poop on its
 head.'"

Watch Cat Osterman in her 6'2 Texas glory pitch a shut out to the Australians. The US probably won't sweep this Olympics like they did Athens but they'll get gold for sure."

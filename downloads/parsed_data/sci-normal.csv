"event","She was the prettiest nurse so far. In fact, I looked away right as she came in, so that she wouldn't notice my gaze. Mr. Ghost had obliviously noticed it because he felt like it was the right time to say.
""She is pretty, don't you think darky marky?""
""I refuse to acknowledge you, with your name calling."" I say back, still staring straight down. 
""Oooh, now he is showing off for you."" 
""SHUT UP"" I grumble to him, I wonder if she is finding this funny.
""Mark? I need you to come with me."" 
""Ooooh, looks like someone has a date now..."" taunts Mr. Ghost
""When she says turn your head and cough, give her a kiss."" He adds in as I crawl out of bed. 
I look over at him and give a nice cold stare, but there is just his face smiling back at me. The tile is cold on my feet and I always feel so uncomfortable walking in a gown. Afraid that it is going to fly up or the starchy feel against my skin. It feels like I am wearing a gown made out of a paper bag. I look up at the nurse to give her affirmation that I am ready to follow her and begin to walk with her. She tries to make some small talk.
""So do you enjoy Mr. Troube?""
""Yeah, for the most part, he has his ups and downs.""
""Oh, I wouldn't be able too, he is just so annoying and did you hear he asked Callie to marry him?""
""Yeah, I was there."" 
Poor, Mr. Ghost. I wonder if he knows that he is such a joke to the rest of the staff? I bet you he doesn't. He seems so naive sometimes. 
""So if you don't mind me asking, where are we going?""
""Well, I'm taking you down to a group session for people struggling with depression.""
""What?"" I saw and stop walking. I feel like a kid in the midst of finding out he is really going to the dentist and not his favorite ice cream shop. 
""We need to see if you are getting better, Mark.""
""I don't think putting me with a bunch of crazy people is going to help me. I'm sorry but I don't want to hear about how much people's lives suck. I have enough suck in my own life to deal with, not the shame and guilt of other peoples lives."" Now I'm really upset.
""You still need to go and try it, who knows you might find something out about yourself.""
Yeah, find out that I hate the people in this world even more. That is the only good thing about group. It affirms my hate for the other people in this world. 
I continue to walk with this new nurse. I want to ask her for her name, but with the recent conversation and me acting like a two year old, I decided this isn't the right time. I walk into an empty room filled with a couple people. The chairs are all in a circle with an empty one for me. 
""Hello everyone, sorry to interrupt, this is Mark. He will be joining you today.""
""Hello, Mark."" are scattered from different mouths. It's weird to hear 4 different people say a chorus of your name back to you. 
""Mark you can sit next to, Bob and Will."" says a man in a suit. I'm assuming he is the therapist. He has the look of a therapist. The middle aged, pushed back hair, looking through gold rimmed glasses, and stress lines. Also he has  therapist eyes."

"event","Breakfast was good. My stomach finally would quite down and my body has some fuel to move. Mr. Ghost was escorted out of the room not much after breakfast, so now it's just me in here. I guess this is one of those times that I am supposed to be introspective. I'm supposed to think about why I am here, why I tried to 'sleep' as I called it when I was talking to Mary. Mary, I wonder where she went too. I'm sure she is at home, she doesn't live here, well like I do. So why did I want to kill myself? I don't know. There is never a simple answer for that question. It's always complicated. No it's not. I wanted to die. It's not that complicated. Well I don't know. I guess it could be. It's hard for me to explain. I mean, who I am explain it to anyways. It's just me here. No one to answer to. My parents left me, I don't have any friends. It's just me and myself. I like it that way. That way, I don't have to answer to anyone. I wonder how long they are going to keep me here. Penned up. Saving me from myself. I'm supposed to be getting better. Is this getting better? Look at me I'm talking to myself. I guess thats better, then talking to myself out loud. I'm not that crazy yet. 

I turn around in bed and watch the daylight. I don't really have the energy to get up and move around, so I just lie there. Why did Mr. Ghost have to go? It's so quite around here with out his breathing or annoying question asking. I think I miss him. Ha, I can't believe I just thought that. I miss Mr. Ghost.

I guess, someone must of been paying attention because at that moment he walks about into the room. He actually seems to be bounding into the room. Happy as ever. 

""What are you so happy about?""
""I had a major break through today, in my group session.""
""Oh really? and what was that?""
""I'm a crazy person."" He says with a smile. 
""Well, I could of told you that.""
""But realizing you have a problem is the first step to enlightenment."" He says with a certain sneer. He walks over to the window that I am staring out. 
""It is kind of a gray day isn't it?"" I say to him.
""Gray, now there is a good color. I like gray."" 
I forgot he had a thing with colors. 
""Why do you like gray, it's so depressing...so bland, so boring.""
""But elephants are gray and there is nothing bland or boring about them.""
""How many elephants have you talked too?"" I ask with a smile.
""A lot, I'm a crazy person remember?"" He answers and walks back into his bed.
I should of saw that coming. I would of carried on our conversation more but just then another new nurse walked into our room."

"event","She leered back at me and I just stuck out my tounge, I know, childish, but I think I am allowed to be right now. 
""Hun, you need to be eat'n somethin'"" 
""Ok, what do you have?""
""Well, lemme think here, we got eggs, pancakes, waffles, and toast.""
""I'll take some pancakes, please, just make sure you don't just give me a spoon this time""
""I'll see what I can do for you hun."" 
""thank you, ma'am""
The nurse turns and starts to walk out of the room. 
""Oh, Nurse, what's your name?""
Mr. Ghost blurts out. 
""Oh it's Callie""
She says as she turns around, then turns back to the door and starts to leave again.
""Oh Callie, I think I love you""
Says Mr. Ghost, while staring at me. I turn to him and smile. I think Mr. Ghost is trying to mock me right now. Figures. 
Callie looks taken back by the comment and continues to walk out of the door. 
""Why did you have to go and do that?"" I ask Mr. Ghost.
""It worked so well for you, I thought I might try it."" 
""What do you mean, it worked so well for me?""
""I saw you talking to Mary last night, she came into see you. That usually doesn't happen.""
Either my stomach is hungry or is it just the nerves. Maybe Mr. Ghost was awake while we were talking, how awkward would of that had to been for him? To have to go through that again, but have it being told by someone else... That had to be... I don't know. I feel like I should ask him about what he might of heard, but it isn't my place, is it? I don't know. I try to strain a smile. 
""It's ok, I know what you guys were talking about"" He says as he adverts my gaze to the window. The blinds have been pulled up and it seems like a cloudy day. It looks like it might rain. 
""Oh you do?"" I say with a sullen stutter. 
""You were talking about how much she wants me"" He turns to me with a giant grin. 
It's in that moment that I know, wheither not he had heard what we were talking about it, that it wasn't going to be a problem. 
""Yeah, she told me she had something for balding guys, that takes me out of her league"" I reach up and pull on a tuft of my hair. 
""Well, I don't know if I would call me balding, I would say, I'm getting more... aerodynamic."" 
Ha, aerodynamic? I can just picture Mr. Ghost flying through the air, hospital gown flailing in the wind. Off to go save some kitten stuck in a tree or help old ladies across the street. 
I hear the familiar clatter of the on coming kitchen cart. I sit up in bed, the movement makes me kind of woozy. I need to get some food into my stomach.  
Soon Callie comes through the door, along with another attendee I haven't met yet. It's a male one, with a scruffy beard and shaggy hair. A grim expression is on his face, Mr. Ghost notices this and asks.
""Whats wrong paul buyon, did babe get away?""
Callie chuckles to herself, but Mr. Buyon doesn't seem to impressed. He places a plate in front of me and then places a plastic fork and a plastic knife in front of me. 
""He can't have the knife"" Callie says and reaches and takes it from my plate. 
""I could do just as much damage with a fork, that I could with a knife."" I mutter.
""Good thinking"" says Mr. Buyon and he takes the fork from my plates and puts down a spoon. 
Not this again.
Callie takes a plate and places it in front of Mr. Ghost. He smiles at her.
""Callie, I think you should marry me. I'm really a rich man, who just likes to pretend he is crazy, but seeing your beautiful face, I just need to get out of here. We would never have to work again, come on, Marry me.""
Mr. Ghost has a pleading look on his face, he clasps his hands and moves them back and forth. Callie looks at him and smiles. She holds up her left hand and shines a ring at Mr. Ghost. 
""I'm sorry darling, but I don't think my Billy would very much appreciate that."" 
""Well, he can come along, we will need someone to be our servant.""
He is persistent I'll give Mr. Ghost that. 
Callie laughs, I imagine she is thinking about her husbands reaction to all of this. Or maybe she is laughing at the proposal that was just made.
""Well, I'll talk to him about it tonight and see what he thinks.""
""Ok, remember, no more work.""
He smiles at her and her and Mr. Buyon make their way for the door.
""NO MORE WORK"" blurts out Mr. Ghost. 
Faintly I can hear the laughter of Callie and a soft grunt of Mr. Buyon as he pushes the cart further down the hall. 
Mr. Ghost gets up and walks over to me. 
""You think she is going to say yes?""
""I'm sure that this Billy is an understanding man, so I'm sure by this time tomorrow you will be on your way to India.""
""No, I don't like India, I would rather go to New Jersey.""
What? Is he talking about?
Mr. Ghost looks at my plate.
""Your food looks sad...""
I look down to see a stack of pancakes and a slab of butter and some syrup packets. 
""What are you talking about? it's excited it gets to be eaten, by me!""
""No, this is excitement""
He takes the butter into his hands and splits it into two and places them on the pancake. Then he takes the packets and makes a smile below the two pieces of butter. He just formed a face on my pancakes. 
""Now it's a happy face pancake, I think I'll call him Fred.""
""What you can't name my food, now I feel like I can't eat him. It's a person. Ahh. You're ruining it for me!"" I say while staring at Fred. 
""Enjoy your cannibalism..."" Says Mr. Ghost as he turns around and heads for his bed.
I take my spoon and cut into Fred's face.
""Poor Fred"" says Mr. Ghost."

"event","Night passed its time and my mind wandered, what am I doing here? Its these times at nights, when everyones mind has shut off, that mind keeps going and wondering. Why is it that I always end up here? In a hospital bed, feeling sorry for myself, I should be healthy by now. Why can't I just flip a switch like everyone else? Why can't it just be that easy? I press my mind harder and harder for answers, but the strain just gives me a headache.  I rest back into my stiff hospital bed and once again stare out at the lone street lamp. I can begin to see the sun rising, finally some morning. I can finally talk to people again. 

I hear a rustling next to me and see Mr. Ghost blinking his eyes and staring at me, not with the creepy eyes, but with eyes of endearment. 
""Don't you sleep?"" He said with a yawn. He stretches his arms and makes some kind of grunt.
""Not really, I don't sleep to much and when I did, its most likely because I medicated myself to sleep.""
""Oh I used to do that for years, then I tried yoga and well that pretty much changed my life."" He said  this with a smile and I didn't know if he was serious or not. It gave me hope that even people like Mr. Ghost can have some sort of humor. They make the day lighter.
A nurse came in, checking up on us and seeing what we would like for breakfast. Mr. Ghost pretended he was at some sidewalk cafe in France and spoke some broken French to the Nurse.
""J'ai besoin des oeufs"" 
She smiled at him and told him, she'll put some eggs on for him. She turned to me and I told her I wasn't hungry.
""But sweet'heart, you haven't slept all night... you must be hungry...""
""Not really, I usually eat about one meal a day, it's cheaper""
""But you ain't payin' for this food, hun""
""Oh I'm not"" I tired to put as much sarcasm into each word as possible."

"event","Turning over and over again, trying to get comfortable. How does one learn to pray? I have never really believed in a God too much. I have been to churches before, but it was usually for the warmth and the coffee. Sometimes, just going to cry too. When you cry at church, people really care. It has always been funny to me, if I were hunched over and crying in the streets (which has happened to me times a many) they would walk right by, but now that I am in their church and crying, they want to help. They offer their friendship. I guess the building matters to some. But where do I start? Do I need to address God, I mean, why would even God want to hear from me. I have nothing to offer him. This is where I always run into problems. I can't begin to talk to a person that I don't even know exists and beyond that even cares for me. But I have to remember, this isn't about me, this is about Mr. Ghost. He is the one who needs this, not me. So I close my eyes and fold my hands, I feel like a fool. God, Lord, Savior, Jesus, Big man upstairs, who ever or whatever name you go by, I know that I can't saying, nor am I good enough to really talk to you, but this isn't about me, it's about Mr. Ghost, I mean, ... I can't remember his name now... oh you know who I mean. He has had a hard life, well I know there are probably people with worse lives and you are off helping them, but if you got sometime, He could use some help. I know that I am no one to ask, or even if you are listening, I feel foolish. Do I need to be kneeling for this? I don't even know why I am doing this. Oh I'm sorry. Yes so help Mr. Ghost, thank you. amen. or whatever I say."

"event","""He lived with an abusive alcoholic for a father. He would be constantly spending the families money on alcohol and women, then come home and beat his mother for not having any money to buy food. They would constantly fight and yell, but I guess, he just got used to it. Well whenever it got really bad, his mother would always yell at him to go hide in the underneath the stairs closet space. He was small enough that he would be able to fit and he wouldn't have to worry about his father coming in there after him. One night, before his father returned, his mother told him to start hiding now and no matter what happens that she loved him. He was really to young to understand what was going on, but he hid anyways. Well, this is where all the speculation happens, but his mother tried to kill his father when he got home. She was tired of the abuse and knew that if she didn't try it first, she or her son, would end up dead. Well when the father came home, he wasn't drunk, as usual. His mother tried to attack him with a knife and got one good shot in, but he was the bigger of the two and fought her off. She got knocked off her feet and he raped and stabbed her to death. I know that he had to be able to hear the yelling, but his mother told him to be quiet and he always did what mother told him too. Well, what happens next, is the disturbing part and the most sad. The father in a state of panic and shock of what happened, took the now dead body of his wife and hid it the only place he thought no one would look, in the under the stairs closet. He took the body and shoved it in there, the kid didn't say a word, not even a peep. I guess he knew if he were to say something, he could end up dead, so he just hid in there as his mothers dead body was pushed in there right next to him. Then his father closed the door and moved a chest in front of the opening. The kid had to try to get out, he had to push up against the door, but there was no way, he wasn't strong enough.  Well after about a week of her missing, the police showed up and searched the house. They moved the chest, they opened the door. They found the dead body of his mother and what else they found surprised them. It was her son, white as a ghost and unable to talk. He had been in such a state of shock for so long. The trial made the news and soon enough this little boy was everywhere, on TV's and newspaper. He couldn't understand why, it all reminded him of being in the closet and having to relive it, so eventually he left his foster home and well, ended up on the streets. He came to this hospital about 20 years ago, at the age of 15.  We have tried and tried to put him in a home, but he always wants to come back here. He says he can only stay here. So we have let him. And for the last 6 years I have worked here, I have never seen him take to a person like he has to you. Most people once they find out his story, treat him differently, but you, well you treat him like a friend. So please keep it this way and you can't tell anyone I said anything about it. Please don't...""
""I won't."" Is all I can squeeze out of my throat. I take a look at Mr. Ghost and I see him still staring back. That creepy and eerie stare. What must he have seen in that closet for a week, what must he have gone through. I feel bad now, I feel sorrow, here I am, complaining about my life, my self destructive nature and here is a man, who did nothing, nothing and yet something so horrible has happened to him, that he now sleeps with his eyes open. I don't know if I believe in God, never really gave much thought to it, but right now, I feel like I should pray for some sleep for Mr. Ghost. Would God listen to the prayer of some nonbeliever if it was for a man who has suffered as Mr. Ghost, I don't know. 
""Well, after that upbeat bed time story, I got to get back to my rounds, I'll come check back up on you in a bit."" Mary gets up and leaves. I nod to acknowledge her leaving, but that is about all I can do. 
How could a man have gone through that? I roll over onto my side and look out the shaded window. The yellow glow of the street light and the cars driving by, I begin to think, how my life is nothing compared to the suffering of one person, but yet, Mr. Ghost seems so normal to me, I wish I could talk to him about it, but I also need to treat him the same. I roll over again and sit up. Looking at him straight in the eye, I say. 
""Mr. Ghost, I know you're sleeping and you can't hear me, but I wanted to tell you, well I'm here for you, as a friend and well as your room mate. I'm here for you, I'll be praying for you.""
The last bit sounds so lame and patronizing, but I guess, it gives me comfort, that I am actually trying to help him. Laying back down, I try to think about how I am going to have to learn how to pray."

"event","I watch the spoon dance across the tile and land next to Mr. Ghost. He looks at me quite quizzical and then reaches down for the spoon and walks over. 
""I think you dropped this"" He says dropping back on to my tray. Right into the middle of my salad, mind you. I'm not going to be even begin to touch that salad, God knows whats on that floor and the last time someone cleaned it.
""Yeah, Thanks, I guess its that whole gravity thing again"" I say with a sarcastic sigh, but Mr. Ghost thought this was absolutely hilarious and started laughing out of control. He keels over onto the floor rolling on the ground laughing. Mr. Ghost is such a character, but I can't even begin to smile. He notices that and gets up and goes back to his food. My stomach is still hungry but I don't want to eat the floor salad, so I just roll over and watch the hallway. My eyes get heavy and I begin to drift off to sleep. All I can remember is hearing the chewing from Mr. Ghost  and the soft hum of electricity. 

I stir awake in the middle of the night and move my hand under my head. This usually wouldn't be that big of a deal, but the fact that I can do it means my restraints are gone. I sit up in my bed and look at my wrist, they are a little rough from all of the struggle, but I'm going to be just fine. The room is painted with a cool midnight blue as street lights bleed through the window blinds. The soft glow of LEDs and the same soft hum of electricity have always been comforting when I awake in a hospital. Looking over to Mr. Ghost's bed, I can see him sitting up in bed with his eyes wide open. They look a little hazy but they are staring right at me, or at least in my general direction. 
""Ummm, hello"" I whisper. 
Nothing. Not even a stir, just sitting there staring. The look on his face, I can't really place it. It looks like a mixture of fear, unbelief, and confusion. I try again.
""Hello"" a little louder now, but still nothing. 
""Hello"" I say in a normal voice.
""Hello"" returns a voice, not of Mr. Ghost, but of a female voice, it was Mary's voice. 
I turn towards the doorway and standing in the door way is Mary, with her smile. 
""I'm glad to see you're awake, you hardly touched your food."" 
""I had troubles eating it, but I'll be fine now."" I hold up my unshackled wrist. 
She does her little laugh and begins to make a notion of leaving. I want her to stay so I just blurt out.
""Is he ok?"" I nod to Mr. Ghost. 
""Oh him, hun, he always sleeps like that. Its creepy at first, kind of like that Edgar Allen Poe story, you know, the one with the eye? but after a while, you get used to it. He will be like that to morning"" 
I know the story she is talking about, it is one of my favorites. I want her to stay and talk for it will be hours before I can fall asleep. My brain was awake and the only way to shut it down would be some meds or some Jack Daniels and I don't think I will be able to get either. 
""Can you stay and talk with me for a bit, I don't think I will be falling back asleep tonight."" 
""Sure I can stay for a while, let me go check up on a few other patients and then I'll be back.""
She leaves the doorway and the door slowly closes. I get this fear that she just said that to leave and she isn't coming back. I always worry about that. Whenever someone says they are going to be ""back"". I never believe them. I always think that they are just trying to get away from me, I'm some kind of hindrance.  I begin to feel worse, when I hear Mr. Ghost stirring a bit. I look over and he is still staring back at me. It is incredibly creepy. In fact it chills me right down to the bones. I now can understand what Poe was talking about, but it hasn't drove me that crazy yet. My anxiety keeps raising and raising as each second passes and she isn't back yet. Self-doubt and self harm begins to enter my thoughts. Inadequacy begins to set in. But as soon as my pity party starts, the door is creaked open and Mary slips through the crack. A sigh escapes my lips, but I hope it wasn't loud enough that she could hear it. She smiles and sits in the chair next to me. She is holding a cup of coffee and the smell makes my stomach begin to turn. I still don't know what to say, so I just being to talk. 
""So I bet you're wondering why I am here""
""Not really, I can read your case file""
I'm an idiot. A complete idiot.
""But you can go ahead and talk about it if you want""
""Well the case files are wrong, I'm really the extremely rich king of a small middle east country and I'm in here as part of a protection program.""
""I see, well your highness, I'm so sorry we have treated you so badly""
""Rightfully so, you will be forgiven, you will at least, but Ted, I don't know about him.""
She laughs and I smile. I haven't had a real friend in such a time. Well I guess I can't jump to the conclusion that we are friends. She probably is only doing this out of pity, she is only doing this because I'm such a screw up and she can see it. I mean come on, she can see my files, why would she WANT to spend time with a waste of time like me. 
""So your highness, is there a real reason why you're here.""
""Only if you'll tell me why you're here""
""I'm here because I need work some extra hours to make some ends meet. It's hard being a single mother, to raise a child and to keep a head.""
""It's even harder to be a crazy person."" I say with a smile, but I fear she didn't get that humor. 
""I'm here because I was found with a stomach full of anti depressants and a handle of Jack. I was not really trying to kill myself, I just wanted to sleep. I wanted to escape. See the problem with me, Well not the only problem, but a major one is, that I can't sleep. I don't sleep. I wish I could, but my brain, its hardwire to keep thinking and thinking about things. Then when I want it to be quite, it just keeps going off about how worthless I am. How I am a failure. It's like my parents are living inside my head. I try to drown them out, but I can't. I try to escape, but I can't get away. It's really a nightmare. I can't stand it. I just wish I was a robot and I had a button I could press to shut down.""
I look down at my hands on my laps. I can't make eye contact with her. I know she is judging me, right now she is placing me somewhere on her crazy scale. I can feel it. The judgments, the speculation's, I can feel them. 
""That would suck, I hate my parents and not mention they were overweight, so that would be a heavy load to carry all the time.""
I smile and look over, she smiles back. 
""I've been in and out hospitals my whole life. My parents are rich, made big money in real state and the stocks. So they just keep giving me money. It's like they think that they can buy a cure for whats happening to me. I haven't talked to them since I left when I was 18. The only time I see their name is when they are putting more money into my account. I have tried to talk to them, but I'm just a failure in their eyes, a disgrace, a lost assets. I keep trying to get on my feet, to do something for them, but alas, I'll never be good enough. I'll never be successful, I've been labeled a lost asset and thats all that I am.""
I don't even know why I am saying this stuff, why I am confessing my personal life to this complete stranger. I look down again but out of the corner of my eye, I can see her smile. 
""You know, I think it's good that you are here. I know that I am happy. I haven't seen Mr. Troube this happy in a long time.""
Mr. Troube, oh. Mr. Ghost. 
""I actually have been calling him Mr. Ghost because of his thinness and paleness. I swear if I didn't hear him breathing, I would think he was a ghost.""
She has a light hearted laugh and agrees.
""Mr. Ghost, I like that.""
""What do you mean you haven't see him this happy?""
""Most of this roommates don't pay attention to him, they find him annoying or just to weird to deal with, and Lord knows the staff doesn't like him. I think it is a mixture of fear and well, pity for him. Me myself, I kind of like him.""
I could understand how people could see he was annoying, but that doesn't mean he should be treated any different. I never understood that. To me, he has been the most genuine roommate I have ever had. 
""Can you tell me what he is in here for?"" I ask.
""Well I'm not suppose to, but better you hear it from me, who will tell you the truth and not what they think happened..."""

This has to be a humorous sight because Mr. Ghost has stopped eating and now watching, intently I might add. He laughs as I try to get more the a leaf of lettuce in my mouth and the frustrations on my face. I begin to grab at it, but the restraints still hold my hands to far. Frustrated, I throw my plastic spoon across the floor."

"event","She walked out of the door with a smile.
""You don't love her, do you?"" Mr. Ghost interjects, it seems a defensiveness in his voice. 
""I don't know, maybe? why what is it to you?"" 
""Nothing at all Mark, Marky Mark. Mark the Shark, Stark Mark. Fe fi fo Fark.""
""Stop that""
Now I suddenly regret telling Mr. Ghost my name. Really regret it. 
He seems to have lost his adoration for name calling and slumps back into his bed. He begins to look out the window. I really want to ask him about his comments earlier, but he breaks the silence first. 
""You shouldn't of gotten the salad, green is an ugly color.""
""Well, the stain on your shirt begs to differ"" I point to the jell-o stain on his shirt, he looks down. 
""So it is, such an ugly color."" 
""Isn't green considered the color of living things? Like plants and new grass? shouldn't green be a beautiful color?""
""But green is also the color of mold, decay and eventually death. Have you ever seen a rotting corpse. It's skin a sickly pale green. It almost makes you want to throw up, in fact it does right now, the smell so fragrant in my nose.""
What has he seen? How does he know these things. Mr. Ghost is concerning me now, in fact for the first time, I see his eyes become very pensive and sullen looking. A lone tear runs down the side of his cheek, whatever he is thinking about right now, I can feel it pulling down my heart too.
""You're right, green is an ugly color, so what did you get to eat?""
""The salad""
A faint smile comes across my face and I see the corner of his mouth rise to exposes a little smile. 
Down the hall I can hear the sound and clank of the dinner cart coming. After being around these types of places for a while, you can hear different sounds and know exactly what they are. The sound of the emergency buzzer and the sound of the staff running to help the person. Sounds of parts of the staff laughing at something, sometimes a joke, but sometimes its a person, you can usually sense that in the laugh. The sound of a gurney going by, the moan of its occupant. 
The clank of the dinner cart is right outside of our door and I see two people come in. One is Mary, who looks over to smile at me. The other is a man with a big white bandage on his hand. This must be Ted. I suddenly feel very awkward and I can feel the glance of his eyes. 
""Oh, Ted, he isn't going to bite you again, I told you he is a nice guy, not some kind of animal""
""Yah, Ted, I am sorry""
He kind of grunts and gets the food out of the cart. He walks over and places a tray in front of Mr. Ghost. Mary grabs a tray and brings it over to the table in front of me. She then makes some slack on my restraints, so I can eat effectively. 
""I told them to give you a light dressing, since you're watching your calories and all.""
She smiles again and then gets out a spoon, a plastic one. I pick it up and look at it very quizzically.  She kind of got the expression on my face.
""I know, I tried to get you something else, but any patient who has hand an episode has to have plastic utensils, I'm sorry""
""Don't apologize for the rules, Mary, especially to patient.""
Ted looks at me with a disdain. I try to advert the glaze, but I can still feel him burning a whole into the side of my head. 
""Ted, that is uncalled for, I apologize for Ted too, he isn't the happiest now that you took his lover away from him"" 
I chuckled at the joke, but I feel like Mary, Ted and I were the only ones who got it, poor Mr. Ghost. His face was covered in ranch anyways and his current thoughts were on dismantling this salad. 
Both Ted and Mary get back behind the cart and begin to push it out. 
""We'll be back to pick up the dishes in a bit, I hope you enjoy your meals, the both of you""
""thakney youesws"" Mr. Ghost mumbles with a mouth of lettuces."

"event","There was a slight tug in my stomach, I am hungry. The struggle and fight had wasted what was left of my energy and even though I slept, my body still needed food. 
""Did I sleep through lunch?"" 
This question seemed silly to me, for I could smell lunch on Mr. Ghost breathe. Broiled chicken and steam vegetables. And from the green stain on Mr. Ghost gown, it seems that there was lime jell-o. I like lime jell-o. Damn alarm clock and damn self destructive nature. 
""Yes, but you will be asked about dinner too, I feel like you should ask the man for the rest of his hand for dinner, maybe that and some fava beans?""
""But I doubt they have any nice chianti..""
We both grinned. Mr. Ghost has become quite the entertainer. I shift my weight in the bed and the tug of the restraints begin to dig into my ankles, this is uncomfortable. My headaches and so does the rest of my body, moving my arm over I notice a band aid from the shot. With so many shots into that arm, I feel like I should have a scar by now. Soon enough, the skin will be so callous and think, what are they going to do? 
""Do you dream?""
I shift my head back to see Mr. Ghost, staring intently. He looks like he is looking at something behind me, I turn to see, that he is really staring at nothing.
""I do dream, but what do you dream?""
""I don't sleep enough to dream, it seems like the only time I can crash, is off of alcohol or just being strung out, and of course the medicated sleeps here, so I guess I don't remember if I dream or not, but I guess I do. I don't know, I mean I dream about becoming things, like aspirations, but do I dream when I close my eyes, like sleep dreams, I don't know.""
There is a silence between us, I know that I over analyzed the question, I tend to do that, but I also know that he was wanting me to ask him about his dreams. I don't want to, but like a begging dog, I'm a sucker. 
""What do you dream about?""
""Well sleep dream, I dream about leaving my body and going somewhere else. All I've ever known for the last 10 years, is the off-white color of hospital walls and hallways. The cheap taste of microwaved food and stale water. When I sleep dream, I get to leave this place and visit North Africa, China, the Great Wall, Disneyland. But aspiration dream? I guess, I dream of being normal. So then I could leave this off-white prison.""
I want to pry more into this, but he lies down into his bed and looks away. I think I struck a nerve, or caused him too. He looks like a child, who wants to leave the room, but can't, he is too scared. Understanding has never been one of my best qualities, but it is easy for me to see, that he is scared. The room begins to cool off into a calm quiet. I'm getting sleepy, the lack of food is taking its toll. 
A female nurse enters. She is slightly attractive, 5'5ish brown hair, hazel eyed. She looks worn out, like she has been chasing something all day and has now given up and decided to wait around for it to come home, perhaps a chicken or a cow, I am hungry, I hope they come home soon. 
""What can I do for you, hun?"" she smiles at me, to put me at ease, but I can notice that she is glancing at my restraints and timidly moves out of my reach. 
""I don't suppose you got the keys for these things?"" I try to put forth my most attractive smile, try to be suave, think Humphrey Bogart. 
She nervously laughs and says something about maybe tomorrow, if I am good, they will take them off of me.
""I heard you have quite the nasty bite? Poor Ted, he had to get stitches.""
I hear a loud chuckle come from Mr. Ghost bed and the nurse turns to him and smiles. 
""I didn't mean to bite him so hard, I just wanted some help with a ringing in my head, then they all get aggressive and hold me down and put their hand of my mouth, I guess I just reacted, thats all...will you tell him I am sorry?"" 
""Sure, hun.""
Hearing use the word hun, makes me feel endeared.
""Well, what would you like to eat for dinner?""
""Do I get a menu? do you have any duck or perhaps a nice NY strip?""
She laughs at my humble attempt at humor, I hope she isn't patronizing me, my natural urge is to second guess her, but I stay quiet. 
""No, hun, we got nice breaded chicken or a nice chicken salad?""
So the chicken did come home, my stomach does flips in excitement.
""I'll have the chicken salad, trying to watch those calories.""
I move to pat myself on the stomach, but my wrist are restrained. 
I see her first legitimate smile, I impressed her. She turns to walk out the door and I calmly ask. 
""Excuse me, whats your name?""
""Mary"" yells Mr. Ghost from under his sheets. She laughs again and points to her name tag. Where it clearly says Mary and has a picture of her smiling. It was her fake smile, not the real one, not the one I just got.
""And what is yours?""
I turn to Mr. Ghost to see if he was going to yell it out, but he got out of the sheets and looked to listen. He didn't know my name. I guess that make sense, I never gave it to him. 
""My name is Mark."" 
She smiles and begins to walk for the door.
""Oh and Mary, I think I love you.""
She smiles again, her real one.
""Of course you do."""

"event","""What are you here for?"" quietly rasped a voice has a hand rapped on my forehead. My inital answer was sleep, I want to sleep, but thats not what I am here for, its just want I want to do. 
""I'm here because I am sick""
""You don't look sick...""
""It's not a sickness you can see.""
""Oh well, I hope you get better then.""
I open my eyes and the sharp light feels like finger nails on chalk board between my ears. I wonder how long I slept. I know its the first soild sleep I have had in months, but it was a pure medicated sleep. Nothing to do with me, just a chemical reaction that shut down my brain, finally. None of it I remember of course too, just the fact that I had been sleeping and that some how, I am here. I look across the room to see the face of the voice that so rudely awoken me. A middle age man stares back at me, but is just a blur right now. After straining my eyes, I see he is a thin man, that is balding. His skin looks pail and in his hospital gown, he looks like a ghost. Infact if it wasn't for the fact that I had just talked to him, I would think that I am still sleeping and he was a dream ghost, coming to haunt me for something I did. 
""Good morning"" he says to me now, noticing my eye contact and stares. 
""is it morning?"" I ask as I look to my wrist to notice my watch is gone and is replaced by a medical bracelet.
""Is it good, is the question.""
Touche, Mr. Ghost has a sense of humor, or prehaps is just slightly introspective. I push myself up in the bed and feel a sharp pain in my arm, it must of been where they gave me the last shot. After quickly looking around the room for a clock, I notice nothing out of the ordinary, just a pale, lightly light hospital room. 
""Do you know the time, Mr. Ghost?""
Whoops... ""I mean, well, do you know the time?""
""Time is something that everyone wants more of or at least wanting to know...""
Now he is getting annoying. I suddenly feel very dizzy and lay back down. The sudden movement sends my head into a spin and I begin to hear a slight ringing in my ears. 
""It's 11:30"" He replies ""They are going to be by soon to check up on you and see if you want to eat something for lunch.""
The thought of food makes my stomach tighten, but the thought of hospital food makes me feel sick. Besides, the ringing is getting louder. It is almost like there is an alarm clock in my head with little legs running around in circles. The thought of that makes me chuckle and I guess Mr. Ghost didn't want to feel left out, so he started laughing too. The light was begining to hurt my head so I close my eyes, in hopes that will stop the ringing, but that alarm clock just found a moped and is now going faster. I pull the sheets over my head and hide beneath my pillow. 
""I tried that once, they still found me.""
He really needs to be quiet and let me focus on killing that alarm clock. This pain is stopping me from sleeping. I concentrate on the ringing and soon my fist clench up and I begin to yell silently and muffle myself. What is going on? I begin to punch myself in the head in order to get it to stop. And now, I can't help but yell as I strike myself repediately in the head. This is my self destructive personality. Mr. Ghost thinks this is aboustely a great time to laugh and does so. 
""I tried that too, it won't stop it.""
""Shut up"" I yell at him, I feel bad, it is not his fault that my head is ringing, or maybe it is. Maybe its all thoses stupid comments or maybe its just seeing his stupid face. I don't know what it is, but soon enough, the boys in white show up. 
I have a certian distain for hospital staff. I have been in and out of hospitals for a majority of my life and it always seems the only good thing they ever do for you, is well, getting you jell-o. And they even sometimes manage to screw that up. 
They begin to restrain my arms and yell for the nurse to give me a shot. 
""I don't need a shot, I need the ringing..."" my mouth is suddenly covered with a big white hand that taste like plastic. My obvisious reaction is animal nature and I bite it. The man yells and I feel a strike against my head and a sudden pain in my arm. I look to see a nurse giving me a shot. I want to yell at her too, but then my veins turn to ice and my body goes limp. I always rathered enjoyed this part of a shot, it made me think about what a herion user must feel. I can't keep fighting and my eyes get heavy. There is still a ringing in my head, but that alarm clock's moped is broken and he is now getting tired. The ringing is getting more faint and I can feel myself falling into a sleep. I guess a medicated sleep is better then none."

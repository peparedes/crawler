It REALLY pisses me off.... anyway, point is maybe I have to write in this damn thing more often to get noticed. I don't THINK anyone reads livejournal and if you do you may want to let me know. 

Because I'd like to know who reads my innermost deepest thoughts about absolutely jack shit. 


NOT."

"event","The doorman opened the door as she stepped out of the spotless lobby onto the dirty, dark gray concrete of the sidewalk, carefully making sure the heels of her 4 inch canary yellow pumps didn't get stuck in the cracks of the old and weather beaten path. The interview went well, however she couldn't help but think she could have done better. Perhaps she could have answered the timeless question of ""why do you want to work here"" a little more enthusiastically, and even smiled a bit more. There was only one thing on her mind the entire time the woman with the bad dye job was speaking to her though, and that one thing was the rush that she felt when she was on stage. It was hard settling for a job where she would sit in a tiny cubicle and stare at a screen all day, typing away to the rythym of a dull and monotonous life, while wasting her creativity away."

"event","um no one reads livejournal so i'm going to complain here because no one else wants to hear it. 

my ''friend'' posts bulletins on myspace and talks shit in her answers sometimes and i know that this shit talking is directed at me. (pretty stupid i know, but im pretty lame) and im too chickenshit to confront her about it. i know she is my ''friend'' and thats why she won't just up and say it to my face.... and i also know that she doesn't trust me for shit because of something i didn't even do a LONG time ago. but it makes me so fucking mad that she won't just up and say something. i think the real reason i won't confront her about it (besides the fact that im a scaredy cat) is because i don't want to deal with talking to a wall. because thats exactly what it will be like. she just doesnt get it. 

i dont really have much else to say. just venting to no one."

"event","i don't really know where to begin. im feeling quite neutral about the world this early morning. im not angry and im not happy. i do however have a lot racing through my mind. i do not particularly like the way my life is going, and somedays i sit and think about the past and what i would have done differently. had i not been drunk that night, had i not of met her, had i not sent him that message.... so many things could have been different in my life based on tiny everyday things that i normally wouldn't think twice about. unless it were a night like this.

"event","im laying here, snuggled up in my make-shift blanket, which is a sleeping bag that i had from when i was younger. i didn't have the money to go buy a nice comforter when i moved out of my grandparents house, so ive been using this ever since. it does the same job, and it might even be warmer. my dog jenna lays with me and gives me that extra bit of warmth that i need to keep from shivering. im half hungry. i had a small microwave pizza at my grandparents house after work. the only time i eat is when im at macaroni grill or if and when i stop by to see my grandparents from time to time. they usually always have something there to snack on. my hairs a little bit of a mess, and i could probably use a shower, but for some reason tonight i just want to sit here and do nothing. i thought for a while that i wanted to go out, but i can't seem to get ahold of anyone except the cute boy from work who wants me to come over and watch a movie with him. normally, i would jump at the chance, but something inside me says that it will only be leading him on. i've always said, that im great to like, but terrible to love. and its the brutal truth.

"event","when i was happy....

when i walked towards you after getting off that plane, i felt my body fill with the most sincere joy i could ever imagine. you know you're happy with someone when even coming home from a vacation without them is more exciting than the vacation itself. i remember watching you from the passenger seat the entire way home, and the inside of that truck was my whole world for just a little while. when i watched you speak, i noticed every single detail about your lips and how they moved, wanting nothing more than to kiss you. there were times when i would go to your house and watch you fall asleep while i was in your arms. i remember looking at every inch of your body and not finding one thing wrong. i would notice and love every single tiny freckle. i felt a warmth crawl through me when i looked at you, every single time, the feeling never dulled and the passion we had intensified with each kiss. no one has ever made me feel the way you did when you kissed me. it's like we were built for it.   

when i was missing him...

it was a deception for him to let me come there tonight and see you. i never expected you to be there, and i never would have come had i known you would have been. i know you don't want to see me. but as mad as i was for being tricked, i was so happy. whether its seeing you across a baseball field, wearing those cute pants and that blue jersey, or whether it's seeing your truck at work while driving by, just knowing that you're alive and well is so reassuring to me. you looked so handsome out there, and every little move you made reminded me of the man i miss every day of my life. you know, not a day goes by that i dont wonder where you are. 

someone else wrote this one...

""Do you realize I would stare at the moon all night just to know that you might give it a glance and we might be finally seeing something at the same time?
I want to know what makes you tick, what makes you shine, what makes you love, because I want to be that person.
I want to make you dinner (again)

and wake up in your arms... (again.)""


<lj-cut text=""and now..."">

last night i made an absolute asshole out of myself in front of the man i love. i wanted to write about it, but not anymore. nevermind.

just know that any chance i ever had to bring back the one thing i ever wanted, is now gone."

"event","since i have nothing better to do, i'll write something. not like any of you who read this don't know whats going on in my life anyway... 

ive decided whatever i want to do in life its going to involve writing. sure, i might not write like a champ on the internet, but when im bored, i write. i keep a journal. i actually wouldn't consider it a journal, its more of a letter, a really really long letter, to damon. i started it when we first started dating, and ive kept it even until now, long after we broke up, just telling him about my life. i think its fun to sit in my car in random parking lots, listen to music, watch cars drive by, and write. i read over it the other day, and it made me happy. when im really down, thats all that cheers me up.

and ive been really down lately. mostly because my closest friends are away at college, or busy with boyfriends, or not girls so i cant talk to them about things, or im too lame to call them to hang out. but i dont have anyone here to physically listen to me bitch/get drunk with, and that makes me sad.

some of you know that im hooked on a boy. i'd say more than hooked, probably borderline stalker. but anyway. after damon and i broke up, i met him. and we convinced ourselves we didn't want relationships because i had too much baggage at the time, and he had too much going on in his life. well, turns out, he was the only one that really didn't want a relationship. i fell for him and kept trying to tell myself i was okay just talking to him, and not having him as my own. nope. i can't get him off my mind. we got really close, and he saw what was coming, so he left. he pushed me as far away as he could because he wasn't strong enough to see me and not want to be with me. and i can't let him go. its so cliche to say that someone is ""the last thing you think about when you go to bed, dream about them, and then they're the first thing you think about when you wake up, and you can't stop thinking about them all day long,"" but it is the damn truth. I literally can't go one hour (sometimes it's every 5 minutes, or he doesn't leave my mind at all) without thinking about him. not just thinking about him, him possessing my mind to the point that i can't focus on anything else. he is the most beautiful thing i have ever seen because of who he is, and how he treats his family, and all i want is for someday to have him in my arms again. i had a dream last night that he came back to me. and i woke up happy today for the first time in a long time. 

now if only dreams came true."

"event","well, first and foremost... i HATE men. 

Men treat me like shit, but also, <i>so very well.... </i> it seems though, only the ones i want to treat me well treat my bad, and vice versa.. im only interested in what i can't have lately. hmph. Men also treat my friends bad, which is gay. so this is my official I HATE MEN post. 

Anyway, work goes well. and so does the summer. drunken summer. being back home at my grandparents house isn't all bad... 

And i want to be drunk right now so i'm going to go shower and get on that. Have a great night."

me and my boyfriend broke up and i am now single and loving it. i hang out with whoever i want, i get fucked up whenever and where ever i want, i flirt with anyone i want, and i come home at whatever time i want. its lovely. i have never been so happy in my life, and also never been so sad. (download: james blunt- goodbye my lover) i still work at macaroni grill and its really alot of fun because rod left and we now have aaron and menn who are the best managers ever. i have a job interview monday for a second job selling cell phones and that hopefully will bring in some extra cash. im excited. i lost my schloarship because my grades suck and i only have one class in college (USF) and its terrible. i need to start studying. other than that there isn't much to my life except working and playing."

WRONG! getting fucked up every night is for trash. that is why i am only partying a little. however the more i do the harder it is to wake up for my early ass days at 8am for work at 9. tomorrow i have a delivery in the morning, then i should PROBABLY if i know what is good for me come home and clean, or do something constructive. after dog obedience class i am going to get my first tattoo! <3 yay! i am running out of things to pierce as my job does not allow any other facial piercings and im not about to get my cooter pierced. too painful ~ yikes! 
on the bottom left side of my belly (you know, where everyone gets their tattoos right just north of the panties) it will start... and im getting three stars, small, medium, and large... yellow, aqua blue, and hot pink.... in kind of a > position... with the hot pink at top and biggest, the blue at the point of the > and the smallest yellow one below both, in between them....

Watching every motion
In my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
My love

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
My love

Take my breath away 
Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am unafraid

Take my breath away 
Take my breath away

Watching every motion
In this foolish lovers game 
Haunted by the notion
Somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning 
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
My love"

"event","the decision has finally been made that im leaving. damon put an offer in on a house today and when he goes so do i. i just discovered that now that i am 18 all of the money and all of the tax returns my grandpa has been holding of mine is MINE and i am entitled to it at any time. i thought that i couldnt have it until he died.. but apparently since im a legal adult, it is my money and i can do anything with it i please. this would be so much easier if i were graduated, but NONE of you know how he treats me (my grandfather) not a ONE of you. i tell you we fight, i tell you im mad at him, none of you have the slightest idea of what kind of hell it is in this house. and thats how i like it. it seems nice if you visit, i seem okay when i leave. you have no idea. prepaid legal is 16 dollars a month. thats a lawyer, everything i need involving a lawyer. i dont know what i will do though. go to that lawyer. ask him what i can do. im not trying to toot my own horn, but my family has a ridiculous amount of money. i just dont see it all because its wrapped up in our houses, bank accounts, and a bunch of things i do not understand. well anyway the point is when he dies im going to get a huge sum of money to survive off of. HES NOT DEAD. so im poor. but thats only a myth, apparently some of the money is mine now since its in my name and im 18. he puts accounts in my name. i wish i could make it clear to anyone, even myself. all i know is that there is money there. right now. for my taking. i just dont know how. so im going to go to a lawyer. i can get prepaid legal and get a lawyer, or i can go to the lawyer that my grandpa deals with. because he knows about all the money. and im going to take what is mine, and i am leaving. this all sounds insane. but it probably will work. my fiance has enough money to support the both of us... just for survivial. there wont be any lavish living like there is now. no 150$ purses and probably lower cell phone plans... stuff like that... but we can survive. he put an offer in on a house today... i really wish he would choose a tiny appartment because i think that would help out alot. the consequences are really great. i wont be able to get a third dog because that will be too expensive.. i wont have my own car, we will have to share. unless his mother buys him his truck like she has been promising since his birthday (december).... i could always go back to my age old plan of getting a motorcycle (hey no insurance).... we will struggle like you have never seen struggling.... he can support me until i graduate... and once i graduate im full time working... im trying to get a raise right now in the mean time but for some reason they only seem to pay people who have been there a shorter time than me more =\ i have bills to pay too, with or without moving out... but when i graduate i can serve full time... college will be in there, but st pete college cant be that hard... i wa going to go away, then to usf, and now i decided the cheapest way is to stay at spc... all the money saved for me for college IS mine right? if i just take that... i'll be set... i can leave, i wont have to deal with him anymore. i dont know, what do you think? is it possible for an 18 year old girl, along with one other person, to survive out in the world all alone>?"

he must not know it means everything to a girl to make her his world."

"event","is it bad to be afraid? is it bad to be in fear for your life every moment of the day? is it bad to fall asleep at night, worrying, and not being able to close your eyes? all i feel right now is a piercing fright that will not leave my bones, which it runs deep down into. i feel like i am on the edge of my seat, knowing something is going to happen next but not knowing where to look for whatever is coming. it makes me look twice behind me to make sure theres nothing there, it makes me hide further under my blankets at night. all the clues lead up to me being afraid of something, but that something i can not name. it is not tangible, but i just have a fear. a fear of, perhaps, what is coming. 

when someone is angered by me, they can look at you with the deepest coldest glare you have ever seen. i can picture over and over in my mind, them losing it and killing me. shooting me. strangling me. hitting me in the face. everything goes blank and then i shake it off and there they are, just as they were, just staring straight at me still like nothing had ever happened. because nothing ever did. 

tonight my grandfather looked at me, and then pulled out his gun next to his chair and he shot me right between the eyes. and it all went blank. and i shook it off. and there he was. staring. 

when you are afraid. your chest begins to feel tight, and cold. you break into a clammy sweat, your heart is about to beat out of your chest at any tiny jolt. there is no reason to live in fear when you are a happy person. when you are a well person. there is no reason why a person should make the mistakes she makes to cause her reason to be in fear. 

but its okay to be afraid.

every mistake ive made has been for a reason. because shes right. you could do better. and you will. and to my family, i am a horrible child. you're right. 

and to my friends. im not afraid of you. because no matter how badly some of you may treat me now and then, you dont mean to. its only my insecurities eating me alive. 

maybe thats what im afraid of. it isnt death. but myself."

"event","well im satisfied. im okay with me and sara not being friends right now, and im okay with mike not talking to me, and im okay with failing math because ive done the best i could, and im okay with having to pitch because marcy is really nice. i have other friends. some fairweather friends, and maybe one or two close ones. if sara decides she wants to be my friend, thats fine. if she doesnt, thats fine too. i'll live. yeah i'll be upset now and then... when im depressed... because i love sara, but i'll live. and mike, is better off without me anyway, nuff said. and who cares about math, who needs math in life anyway. ha. yeah.

brad likes me. i like brad. i have my new boyfriend john (according to somebody who loves me out there and talks about me behind my back to christy).... and chris is going to make some time for me soon. im hanging out with megan and natalia friday before i see brad and we'll have fun at the beach. 

i dont cry anymore out of sadness. but out of satisfaction. 

its okay to be satisfied sometimes."

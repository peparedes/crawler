"event","Well Ali reminded me that I haven't updated in a while, and its because I have been really busy. But just so you know Ali it brings me joy when I listen to my messages and the first thing i hear is ""I miss Kris...tin...a"" HAHAHA it makes me soooo happy!!! I know some of you out there know what I am talking about. hehe. So i already have midterms next week, three in one week, and its going to be hell. I just had midterms two weeks ago, so thats what sucks about the quarter system. I guess its ook though, although I really need to study but am updating this thing instead. I am trying to think of some fun things that have happened lately but its hard because days seem to just blend together in college. Halloween was lots of fun. Kimi and I dressed up in ugly 80s clothes hehe. Mine included bright blue spandex pants, leg warmers, a colorful leaotard and an over shirt thing. It was all pretty good and kimi had a really umm... lets say cool sweater suit. hehe it was funny we have a picture but I ma stupid and don't know how to add pictures so if anyone wants to tell me how I can try and post some pictures, because our RA loves her digital camera and gets lots of interesting pitures. I am really glad we have a cool RA, she is actually one of my best friends in the building since we live in the nerd building. By the way today was the Nintendo tournament in our building. Doesn't that just sum it all up? Yeah so anyways...back to Halloween. So we went to a party at a girl from my riding teams house and their parties are really fun. Everyone gets drunk and plays Kings Rule and I always end up drinking a lot hehe which is fun. At one point I managed to ummm borrow this guys fake bloody arm thing and I had a lot of fun with that hehe. Poking people and such. I have been able to make quite a few friends on the riding team which has been fun. Umm then we had an interesting walk back with some guys and I am not going to get into that... but we will just say it was fun. and lets see what elso has been going on umm I have actually gone home a couple of weekends but haven't been able to do much there or see people because I still had homework to do and such. I am looking forward to going home over thanksgiving though. Well i can't really think of anything else but I really will try to update more...hopefully there will be something fun to talk about after this weekend because I am hoping to have a good time but then again sometimes that doesn't happen and all of my riding friends are at a horse show in cal poly but I don't get to show so... we will see.

"event","I am way late on this update I know and I probably still won't say everything because thats a lot but....here goes. Well Kimi and I moved in and I am really thankful she is here because otherwise I would literally have no friends. HEHE. So we accidentally came a day early to school but it all worked out so on Sunday our other roommates moved in. Kaylie is a soccor player and is busy with team stuff a lot, but we really like her and will be partying with her soon for sure. She is always at soccer boy parties so thats always nice. Our other roommat Claudia is also really nice, but we never really hangout with her or see her for that matter because she has some friends here like her ex which seems to be causing her some problems. anyways so we like our roommates, but the rest of our building is another story. Not to be mean bt they are all serious nerds.Ahh they are so annoying. They invaded our room last night, like actually in our room and were talking about genetics and crap and wouldn't leave. So wehave had a hard time making friends, but we hangout with Gracie Marsh and she has a really cool roommate named Emily so they are sot of buddies right now. I also made friends with a girl in our building that also rides horses, and on the night Kimi left me here alone (hehe she went home a day earlier than me) I got drunk with her and two of her friends Viktor and Chris. It was fun, even though they aren'tthe type of people I normally hangout with. So we haven't been doing much and partying just hasn't happened yet, but it will...oh it will. I also joined the equestrian team (hehe) and it is actually more annoying then fun at least so far. Crap horses, lots of cleaning, hundredsof dollars, and I don't even get to show in the show on Saturday which by the way I have to be at at 6:00 tomorrow morning. I am enjoying the whole concept of college life though and I really like most of my classes. Chem and math suck, but my two animal science clases are awesome! I get to play with animals! Next weeks lab in regular animal science is horses...how perfect is that! Then in my animal science swine class (yes pigs) I play with pigs well actually I had to castrate some which wasn't so fun but i get to see the really cute baby pigs so its okay. Unfortunately the hog barn is located 3 miles off campus and that is quite a bike ride when its like a billion degrees and not to mention I got two flat tires and then I borrowed Kimi's bike and gave her bike a flat too all because of my trek to the hog barn. I sadly had to take some pigs to the slaughter house too in that class but thank god I didn't have to be around for the killing. It was sad, but I will admit the guy that works in the meat lab was pretty cute. hehe. what else trying to think...i guessi will update later with some more exciting newslike big college parties...hehe...that is if i ever get my ass to one. Well feel free to comment because thats always fun. its a bit boring around here. See you all later!"

"event","So I move in in exactly a week and suddenly I am dreading it. It seems like so many of my friends hate their schools and I am afraid I am going to have a horrible time. There better be some decent people there because I really need a change. I hate that I can't have a car at Davis because I know I am going to get those sudden urges to leave and I won't be able to. Part of me is excited about meeting new people and living away from home, but then t the same time I am leaving everything that I am used to. I sort of started packing like just blankets and stuff but it made me really sad. Actually what made me really sad was the fact that today was the last day I may ever get to see my horse. He is off to a horse show with another girl in my barn this week (my last week) and he is for sale, so he might sell at the show. For any of you who read this and don't know what its like to own a horse and then have to sell it...well its like selling someone in your family or your dog or something...its horrible. I love my horse so much and I am really going to miss him. Hopefully he will still be around for a while so I can go up to Santa Cruz on the weekends sometimes. But fuck that meens I have to deal with taking the bus or train all the way home which may not sound that bad but to me it is. I am going to feel so trapped. Not to mention I am not looking forward to doing school work again and the pre-vet major sounds impossible. Two animal science classes, calculus, and chemistry all in my first quarter. Ok well now that I have gotten that all out I feel a little better...sorry to lay it all on those of you who actually end up reading this. Maybe I will have a happier update later, who knows maybe all of this worrying I am doing about school will turn out to be no big deal. We will just have to see."

"event","I know I haven't updated for a while, so I will probably forget some things that have happened but lets see...umm My birthday was almost a month ago and Mara, Ali, and Kimi took me out to dinner at Ponchos and it was a lot of fun. Then I hung out with Ali that night at her friends Kelly's apartment for Ali's going away party. We had a lot of fun playing drinking games, shooting Kelly's bebe gun, and wandering around red hill and hanging out with the ambulence guy. I didn't get home until 5:30 and I was so tired though. Then a coulple of days later Laurel came back from Mexico because she got sick so now I have been hanging out with her a lot and its good to have her back. That week my dad and I went river rafting which was soooo much fun because we had a really crazy guide whole let us so all of htese crazy things like get out of the raft and go down the rapids with just our life jackets. It was really fun except for the huge gulp of water I breathed in! Then Lexsea was the first of my best friends to leave. And we hung out before she left and got fake tattoos again! Lexsea we are such dorks! Then about a week ago Ali left for Arizona, and so we hung out the three nights before she left with Laurel too, and we had a good time talking, going to Farmer's market, hanging out at Connor's, and watching movies. Its so weird that everyone is leaving. I have like no friends left! But its been ok. Also my Friend Alison who went to redwood had her going away party this weekend and its weird because we were best friends when we were little and that doesn't seem that long ago, and now she's off to Boston. the only othe thing thats really happened lately is my friend Bev is giving me her 2 year old warmblood mare to work with while I ma at Davis which is going to be really fun. She is a super nice horse so I am really excited. Unfortunately I still have to sell my horse Pippen which is going to be so hard to do, but I know its for the best. I think thats all for now. I will try to update more often if I remember."

"event","I a back from my horse show and i had so much fun! My horse was really good. I got there on tuesday and had a lesson on my horse and he was really lazy, then we went to dinner and had a ton of desserts Yummy!. Then wednesday was the first day of showing an dwent in a 3'3"" warm-up hunter class and Pippen was a little hyper but not bad but we lunged him before our level 2 jumper class just in case. In that class he got really excited and went into jumper mode (a mode i never knew he had) and ended up fourth out of like 45 horses! The next day was pretty uch an equitation day, and i was 8th on the flat out of 33 horses i think which wasn't bad. Then for the weekend i got to do junior hunters which was so much fun! I for some reason have always wanted to show Pippen in that and he was good, but the judging seriously sucked so we got an 8th over fences and 6th under saddle. But then on saturday the other junior hunter( this one is a small) in our barn well his owner got some allergic reaction so i got to show him in the juniors too! HE is a super nice hunter and we were 2nd in the handy pick your own line class and 4th in the regular junior hunter class. I got a really cute picture of him too, so if i figure out how to post pictures i will put it in. 

On Saturday night we were on our way out to dinner in monterey, and my mom was driving my car and we fucking got in a bad accident. My car is so messed up and it might be totaled. It sucked. By the looks of my car it seems like i would have been really hurt, because the passenger door is completely crunched in. but i am fine thankfully and so is my dog who was lying at my feet. 

Anyways i forgot to mention that Michelle Pfifer or however you spell her name was at the horse show too which was kinda cool. Apparently her daughter rides. I was standing right next to her in line for food of course. There are so many famous people t the horse shows because it is such a rich person sport. Thats why you don't see me at the shows a lot! Too expensive, but i have seen Tom Hanks, Joe Montana, Arnold Shwarzeneger, Shannon Dohorty, sam actress from LIfetime, umm... theres definately more.

Anyways so then MOnday was my birthday, but i had to work, but my parents srprised me at work and came for dinner and we got free desserts and stuff. Everyone was really nice. I got a new ribbon watch, a cool new bike and a really cute collar and leash for my dog that is army print with a pink outline. Its really cute. Now i am 18 yay. Friday night me, Mara, Ali, and Kimi (I think thats all for now) are going out to the city for some dinner and fun so that is exciting. 

Tonight I am off to the city to see Cavalia with my mom, BEv, and Dory so that should be fun too. I think that is all for now. Oh an di got a migrane last night and it was no fun, i really don't know why I get them. well ok then i am off to be a lazy ass and watch tv."

"event","Shit i just wrote a whole entry an dthen it dissappeared so here goes to try and recreate it. Lately i have pretty much been riding and working and thats about it. A few nights ago Mara, Ali and I had a movie night and we watched Now and Then and Cluless. We also baked brownies and Funfetti cake! It was amazing! We also had our own private thereapy session where we just talked for a really long time an dit was really good and needed i think. A little over a week ago Laurel left for Mexico for like three months an di am sad shes gone because we have been best friends since we were like ten and its sad that shes gone. We had a fun going away dinner and all of her closest friends came, ashley, mellissa, caroline, jessica, kate, and me hehe i think thats all. Then ashley, laurel and i saw Napoleon Dynamite which was really weird/funny. Two nights ago Ali and i hung out and drove around before going over to garrets house. Ali successfully figured out what the deal is with the ambulence that parks at the bottom of her hill. We went over and talked to the guys in it and they were really nice. Then we went to garrets which as supposed to be a big party, but it lasted only like 30 minutes before it got moved up to the ridge which i hate because you can't see shit. Its always so dark and cold. I didn' have the urge to drink at all because it wasn't that fun an dby 1:30 we were ready to leave. Oh yeah i almost forgot it was horrible, while we were driving to garrets, we saw chase waslking so we stopped to pick him up, and then the car behind us hit a deer and it was so loud. It sounded like bottles breaking an dthe poor deer flew across the street. it made me so depressed. ok then the next day i went and rode my horse an dhe was really good. We did a fun course and yeah pippen was good so i was happy, especially since next week we go to the Pebble Beach Horse show. Three days until i leave yay! I love horse shows i just w9ish they weren't so god damn expensive. If i could i would show like every weekend. anyways so last night i went to the city for dinner and then to see the broadway musical thing Movin' OUt. It was really good and fun and the boys in it were really cute. then when we walked out of the show when it was over there were all of these ploice cars and caution tape and my mom saw a pile of blood so we think someone got shot. Thats the city for you well at least that part of the city. Today i took care of Ali's kitty and guinea pigs and i made friends with the kitty. then i also took care of my friend bev's three dogs, two cats, and parrot. Our miniature pony also lives at her house so i went over there and played with them an dlunged both ponies. then i went home and went on a bike ride with my dad. Then watched tv, ate dinner, blah blah blah and now i am here. tomorrow i go an dride my horse again the last time before he leaves for the show probably on monday. So three days untill i leave for the horse show yay! and 10 days untill my 18th birthday!I don't really know what i am going to do yet but from what ali an di talked about it looks like dressing up and going to the city is a definate possibility! Thats all for now."

"event","Well i haven't updated for a really long time, because i actually sort of forgot i even have this journal thing. Anyways Ali reminded me by writing in my yearbook that i need to update. I can always count on Ali! Finally I am out of Drake FOREVER which is extremely exciting. I just hope i have a fun summer and don't get too bored. So far i haven't done much. Grad night was so much fun though! Me, Kimi, and Ali sang bus songs on the way over...ummm...i have absolutely no idea how to spell this but sumo wrestlers was so much fun...laser tag...henna...and of course watching Ali get hypnotized. I am kind of sad its over because I know I will never see most of those people again. Then on Saturday after Grad night was Courtney Piper's party and then Mara's, and i pretty much ate continuously through both. Yummy! Then the next day was Fiona's party which was also fun. Now I am all rested after sleeping a lot and am ready for a super fun summer. I have to work Monday, Tuesday (damn Chase jk!!), and Wednesday, and then I go to Santa Barbara thurs through Sunday which will hopefully be fun except for my great-grandmothers funeral, which most likely will not be fun. I think i am going to go ride my horse on Wed. too, becasue I haven't ridden him for a while, and i can't go too long without seeing my horse or i'll go crazy. I might have to sell him though because college is sooo expensive and that is going to be really hard. Anyways now that school is over i will try to update more. If anyone gets bored over summer call me becasue i will most likely be bored too."

At least it went away, but i still missed the first half hour of the OC. And yes that is a horrible thing. Hiral recorded it for me though. Yay! it was a good episode. Come on I know you guys all love it too. Tomorrow ia m going to Santa Cruz and I am leaving around 1:00 so i can sleep which will be nice. I have so much fucking homework to do though, and i know i am going to wait till sunday night and then i'll be mad at myself. Oh well. Maybe i'll finally get to go to a college party.
P.S. Ali my mom gave in again, so...you know what that means. God I love grocery shopping with my mom!"

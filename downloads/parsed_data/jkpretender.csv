I really hate it when athletes refer to themselves as warriors and that 'they are going out to battle'! Yes I know it is a figure of speech but they should really use something different. 

This is especailly bothersome consider we have many fine men and women who are truly warriors. Of course I am referring to the soldiers fighting in Iraq and other places around the world.

These athletes are great, don't get me wrong, but if you look at it closely ... they are really grown men and women getting paid to play kids game. Some of them don't even play it well or worse yet, after they get their big contract decide that it is okay not to give full effort. Yes their are a handful of athletes who have truly given it their all when they are playing ... Michael Jordan comes to mind ... but I would never consider him a warrior. Plain and simple warriors should not be used in the context of sports."

Hey I want to know, how do you people about office romances. Dipping in the company pool is usually frowned upon but if you worked in my office you would change your tune!!  

To make matters worse, my biggest crush is on the boss lady herself. Sure she is a bit older than I but man she is one hot lady! Talk about MILF!

Will wait to hear your opinions!

Peace out"

"event","I went hiking on the weekend and it went really badly. A combination of things piled up and I honestly thought I wasn't going to be coming back and it terrified me. I had an ear infection which raised my body temperature drastically, I was exhausted from a week of nearly no sleep... Roughly 6 hours in 7 days. I wound up with heatstroke as a result and couldn't drink enough water to cool down enough. I also found out when I got back and saw a doctor that I'm anaemic which certainly didn't help.

I don't know what I'm trying to say, but it scared the jesus out of me. And now I'm sitting here in tears because it made me aware of how fragile life is. And I thought about things more intensively than I have before and I think I realise now what my problem is and it leaves a profound sadness in my heart and mind.

Only every now and then, for a couple of days at most, I feel whole... Like I know my place in the world and I can feel good about things... Simple things, like watching people react to each other, the way light reflects off an object, the way animals respond to the world around them and it used to make me happy. But now it just leaves me with a profound melancholy, knowing that I feel all these things and thusly feel complete... But I know it won't last, and that in time, I'll go back to feeling nothing but hollowness, anger and bitterness. I feel enough in those days to miss it so much that I come to resent everyone who gets to feel it always.

And I've come to believe that my life is a mistake... A combination of minor errors and flaws that accumulate into a collosal failure. I wasn't made for any of this and I really don't belong anywhere."

"event","Ok, I've been idly thinking and have gone off on a slightly unusual tangent (stops for exclamations of surprise and shock)... It's about vegetarians.

Now, a lot of vegetarians argue for animal rights, amongst other things... One of the chief arguments I've heard vegetarians use for explaining their choice to forgo eating meat is that it takes a large amount of water and land to grow the crops needed to feed cattle. Now this may be true, but it's also covering up their DIRTY LITTLE SECRET. If we were to stop raising animals for food, and start following their way of life, noone would raise the crops, noone would rear the cattle and you'd look at the extinction of these animals probably over the next 50 years.

I base this on the fact that these animals have been domesticated for thousands of years, and any kind of survival instinct would have been bred out of them long ago. They would be fodder for predators and without no investment in their existence, as a species, we'd be inclined to let nature take its course, so to speak. In order to save them, we'd have to grow crops and keep them domesticated... So vegetarians would have a choice to make... Abandon the animals to inevitable extinction or contradict their own argument to save them.

Muahahaha, I've figured you out, you vegetable murdering bastards!"

"event","I'm getting fed up with people, and myself.

It seems my life is some kind of sick cycle comedy wherein I'll want someone I can't have, but the few girls who'd want me, I don't want. It's a bit frustrating to say the least. It's a good thing that feelings are so watered down for me, that I can walk away with nothing more than an echo of regret, not one of those ""In 20 years, i'll still be thinking about her"" kinds of things that you see all the time in movies.

I went out with a girl, Lauren, twice for coffee. She's a nice enough lass, entertaining and has a genuine zest for life. Yet a couple of nights ago, she pledged her love for me (I'm not kidding, she dropped the L-word) and seems to be trying to get me to come around to her way of thinking by repeatedly dogging me with the same questions over and over. I'll re-iterate, I went out with her twice. Now I know I ooze charm and sophistication (cough cough choke) but I must admit this has taken me aback in a most emphatic way. 

It's freaked me out a little bit.

Now on the other hand, funnily enough, there's a girl at work also named Lauren. Now she'd be a good match for me... She's got a sharp tongue, a sick sense of humour and doesn't really take shit from anyone. But I know that this would never happen. 

But to be honest I think my problem is I only want what I can't have. If ever that changed and it actually happened, I'm sure my wants would change with them, and I'd be back at square zero... I don't know how or why I became like this... I think it's just one bad relationship on the back of another and another etc etc... Maybe I've become too cynical about the whole thing... As soon as things work out, I walk away because I don't think they'll last? 

I think it's worth finding out."

In fact, I've been catching myself whistling and grinning at nothing on the drive to work lately. And on the way home I'm not pissed off at traffic, I just crank my iPod and chill right out.

My insomnia has flared up something fierce as of late, hence this post at 3:40am. Usually that brings me right down to the blackness of hell, but it's not really bothering me at all... I've even resumed teaching myself to play the guitar, acoustic this time, not electric.

"event","I did some thinking yesterday about how numb I've been to shit for a long long time, and I figure it's like this. I can feel proper emotion for one day in every few hundred... The rest of the time, I kind of pretend. I try to remember a time I've been a situation like that before I went numb, and I react that way. 

The best way I can think of putting it into words is to say that I feel like Pinnochio, a puppet pretending or wishing he was real. I sometimes get frustrated by it and get a bit snappy with people, but they mistake that for anger directed at them. It's not. It's merely a bi-product of me getting annoyed at not knowing what I'm supposed to act or react like.

Back to the one in a few hundred thing... That one day is like a flood, like all the feelings that I -should- have had come rushing in at once and it's pretty overwhelming. It scares me, because it's so intense that I feel like I could drown. 

So obviously the problem isn't that I have an inability to feel. It's that I can't control when or how much I can feel at any given time... It doesn't come easily, if not naturally. I'm glad my parents raised me the way they did, because when I'm back in that disconnected state of mind, a moral or heartfelt sense of right and wrong doesn't exist. But the way they raised me left with little doubt as to what is and isn't accepted behaviour. Don't steal, lie, cheat etc. And I'm glad they instilled me with that, or I could have gone off the rails hard by now. 

I know I'm not inherently bad. If I was, I wouldn't want this lack of conscience and feeling to go away. I know I'm not inherently good either, because I can't feel what I'm supposed to in order to be that way. So I guess that'd make me inherently neutral in every sense of the word, but with the added benefit of being raised by great parents. 

I think in figuring all this out, I'm not digging away at myself anymore or drinking myself to oblivion because I think that those emotions are real and that it's the only way I can feel them. They're not and it's not... I'm not hurting myself to try and wake myself up. I'm calm, I'm thinking clearly and I feel like I've got a good chance of working it all out and becoming real again. 

And I think that in the end, I'll be okay."

"event","I've been watching Dexter for a while now, since before it came on TV. After doing a marathon of both seasons, I've come to realise that I relate very well to a lot of the things he says that describe how he functions as a human being, or parody thereof.

The most intense comparison I can draw with the character, is one that he draws between himself and pinnochio... A wooden boy, imitating real life. Acting the part in order to be a part of something, to hide the empty shell from plain sight. I feel like that the majority of the time, doing what I think I should do to fit in and get by, not out of any moral or social necessity or principle, but out of sheer practicality... It's easier this way.

The difference is that I occasionally do have a glimpse or an echo of real emotion that springs up. It's usually a sudden intense sadness or a burst of euphoric optimism, which is more of the former than the latter, but they both exist for me. It's almost like I'm a poorly tuned radio, intermittently picking up a signal, but for the most part blaring white noise, hoping not to be noticed.

The character also mentions a ""dark passenger"" that he carries around with him, that taints and corrupts what would have otherwise been noble intent. I realise that while there may be no perfect people, intentions can be and often are perfect and pure. Mine usually aren't... There's always an undertone of malice in every action I take... A deliberate spite that sometimes I'm not entirely sure exists, but for the most part have come to accept as part of my being.

I'm hardly going to go on a rampage or start commiting random acts of vigilanteism... I just felt like sharing the comparisons I've drawn between myself and a character I find to be intriguing. 

I think it's all out of some recent overwhelming desire to be understood, instead of being accepted for what I may or may not be. Having said that, this is one of the more sedate moments where you could tell me I'm crazy and I wouldn't care. You could say anything and I wouldn't feel it. I think it's all come about because I'm tired of acting out the way I think I should, on an intellectual if not emotional level. To quote Brad Pitt in Fight Club, sticking feathers up your butt doesn't make you a chicken. Pretending to feel something, doesn't mean I feel anything... It just means I'm being dishonest to people who I respect, if nothing else."

Ok, I'm back on anti-depressants again. I don't think they've properly kicked in yet, though I'm getting the complete lack of appetite and the dry throat that accompanied them when I was on them when I was 17. Oh well.

I really hope that they calm me down though... This living on edge shit is getting old, as is the recurrant suicidal ideaology. And the lack of sleep. I'm cautiously hopeful this time though, every other time I've been skeptical. I also have to start doing therapy twice a week now instead of fortnightly.

Guess I'm more screwed up and average than I originally thought.

So beat it... Just beat it! o/"

"event","I've had a lot of time to think recently, mostly because I've not been at work in a long time. I've been seeing a psychologist, which I never thought would amount to much and I'm surprised to say that it has somewhat.

I've been thinking a lot of who I am, and who I pretend to be. Not many people have met the real Dave, I don't think I've ever been myself in relationships and most people see me as an arrogant lout. That's the mask I need to put on, because it stops people getting close enough to see how vulnerable I really am. I've never really put much stock in what people think of me, because their judgement, no matter how harsh, could ever be as harsh as the way I see myself. I hate the person I pretend to be, but it comforts me, because I hate the real me even more.

If I could have one thing in the world, it would be the innocence of a child because this world is one great big fucking disappointment to me. I don't find any wonder in anything anymore. It's all been explained away through equations and research... There's no way I can even feel that, not even for a second. It drains me.

The few people that have seen the real me are people I consider to be utterly trustworthy. People who have such integrity that it sometimes scares me, because I can't imagine being that true to myself. Occasionally I open up a bit when I'm drunk, but I still hold back a lot... The only time I'm myself is when I'm by myself. And I keep bottling it all up. I can't sleep at night because I keep myself thinking about how great it would be to be someone else. I put up the facade of Dave because frankly, I can't imagine anyone liking the man behind the mask. I've systematically destroyed most of my relationships and friendships over the years because I've sensed that I'm getting too invested or dependent upon the approval of the person in question. I don't like that and I don't like the feel of needing something.

The only other thing that gives me any sort of sense of companionship or understanding is music. Because it shows that someone else feels similar and is possibly as broken and misfiring as I am. That gives me some sort of comfort, in a very fucked up sense of the word. Misery loves company, I guess.

I don't know what else I can say that I haven't said already. So I sign off, beer in hand, and leave myself at the mercy of what I make of this post, when I read it later on."

"event","I've got a mental health evaluation coming up. My doctor is ""concerned"" about how I deal with emotions on any level, no matter how superficial. He seems to think that I'm becoming increasingly disconnected from the world.

I think he's right. I feel the world through the soles of my feet, barely noticing where or who I'm walking on. There are no mysteries left in the world, and I say that without the arrogance of thinking I've learned all there is to know. I only say it because what I don't really care anymore, about anything. The only moments where I feel remotely normal are brought on by the strangest things and last for all of a few seconds, after which I go back to clinically assassinating the world at large.

They say we've all got a devil on our shoulders. But for me, it's starting to feel like I'm on the shoulder of my devil, not always getting to dictate a clear moral imperative. I've started viewing the value of human life as being cheap... Like a christmas decoration, it's there for show, and only really for the benefit of others. Life has become the mirror in which I see the inhumanities and injustices of man and the strange thing is that I'm not surprised by the feeling of utter contempt. I'm almost eager to embrace it. 

I wish I could be omnipotent. Then this failed experiment, the human condition... It would all change. But I'm not cynical. I just don't give a damn."

Which woke me up to something. I get so angry about inconveniences in my life, and anything that impedes MY progress... Not that I've made any, but hey... The fact that the progress of these people was impeded by death that quite easily could have been mine, has impacted upon me with the subtlety of a brick thrown from a moving car.

The reality of complaining is that you have to be able to point the finger at something or someone else, and the fact is, that I can't do that. Maybe the sum of everything doesn't matter... It doesn't match the result. Because the result is that I'm numb and that's all that matters.

Maybe things will change, maybe they won't. I'm not going to beat myself or anyone else up about something like this. It's a band-aid... Just because it's there, doesn't mean it's to blame for what lurks beneath. There may not even be anything to be blamed... Just one of those things.

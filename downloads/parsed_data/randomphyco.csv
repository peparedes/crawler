"event","Christmas didn't suck.  I could've delt with less dad though.  The rest of my family isn't a pain in the ass, but gee, what's got him so pissy lately?  Since like the 22 he's just been snapping and fuming at me, and then he seems totally fine later.  But he keeps doing that.  I turn up my music in the car so I don't hear him bitching to my mom.  How can she put up with him?  And he only talks about the stuff that has wronged him, his problems, things that involves him. >> I can understand why he would consiter that worth talking about, but come on!  If that's all he ever talks about, why try to talk to him?

He yelled at me last night after I tried to watch tv.  He was still eating, but I had already waited like ten minutes for him to finish and he was the only one eating.  Then today, he made a sandwitch for himself and david.  Dave said he didn't like the sandwitch, and dad started to call him names.  ""Picky little shit"" comes to mind.  I could go on but I'm about ranted out.

I got some nifty stuff for christmas.  Dave got me March of the Penguins.  Mom got me a little penguin plush, and I got a video iPod.  I also got some jewelry and some shirts.  My aunt got me a new saxophone case (yes! I really needed one) and my uncle gave me money. xD I'll probably buy Sims2 with the cash.  Oh, and I also got DDR.  Surprisingly, I don't suck. o:

My mother's parents are special.  My grandpa had me read this article about leading a better life, and it did have some good points in it.  It was about this speaker that came to talk to a group of girls in the town, and it said stuff like you're shooting for looks that aren't real, and showed them pictures of britney spears before and after make-up, and that sort of thing.  It also said this car thing which I didn't understand.  But, it had kind of a pro-christian tone to it, and listed praying and going to church in his five tips for a better life. o.o

At my uncle's house on christmas, he fired up his hot tub.  So that's how I finished my christmas holiday.  Outside, in 40 degree weather, sitting in my uncle's clothes inside a big pot of near-boiling water.  It's a lot better than it sounds, though. xD After that I was really sleepy but couldn't do anything about it, so I was just kinda sitting around... o.o Yep."

"event","For the past three days I've had nightmares.  I can't remember the first two but I remember last nights.  It looked like something out of JTHM.  The way the guy was drawn, anyway.  Yes, drawn, it's my dream so shut up.

This guy is like 30 or 40, ponytail, creepy, sometimes little red dots on his face.  He wore all black.  We were in a room and out the window there was a blank desert scene.  No cactuses or any sort of life, just... ground.  Not even sand.  Well, maybe sand.  No movement though.  He didn't have any lights on, but his computer was on.  It lit up the room with like a blue-ish glow.  It made a glare on his glasses so I couldn't see his eyes.  He was talking about an alien called Charlie.  And how the world is going to be destroyed when Charlie comes.  

Then it cuts to a house, it's all bright and sunny out, you know the kind, and a salesman is trying to get the family to join like this cult of alien thingies, and they do.  I can't remember everything that happened.  But I remember it kept flashing back and forth between the creepy guy in the deserted room in the desert and the blond salesman with shiney teeth recruiting cult members.  And he kept trying to get me to join.  I said no.  My friends and family joined.  I still said no.  I tried to get the creepy guy to help me when it flashed back to him but he wouldn't help, he just smiled at me.  I didn't like it when he smiled.

Then at the very end of the dream, I go back to where the salesman guy is, and he's whimpering and cowering and screaming and stuff.  It's because the sky is all dark and the buildings are on fire and things are falling down.  And his cult is all dressed in identical robes of white and gold and they have these weird helmets but it doesn't seem to be doing a lot against the apocolyse that the ponytail guy said was coming.  I try to talk to the salesman but he's all screamy and crying and stuff, and I'm looking around, wondering what to do... Then I see this girl.  She's like right between being a kid and being a teen, you know the age, and she's got this long blond hair and bright blue eyes and she's kind of anime-y.  And she's looking around like she doesn't know what to do either.  And I just know that she's Charlie, and I have to talk to her.  So I start to run over, but I wake up then.

It's 4 10 in the morning when I woke up.  That dream scared me.  I don't know why my dream catcher has stopped working...  When I tried to close my eyes after that I kept seeing these tenticle thingies that were all black and sprouting up and one of the tenticles was more of a stub and had a mouth.  

Any thoughts?  Anyone?"

Reasons my dad is kinda dumb:

1. he yelled at me for getting a B in japanese
2. he lied about taking us to the white stripes concert
3. he wouldn't let me go to the blood brother concert
4. he wants me to go to bed at 11 but he goes to sleep at 10 so he is not awake to enforce his own rule
5. the other day he offered the victoria's secret catolouge to dave ._.

The tenors did not go to see saw. ): Not enough people wanted to.  I would have pushed the matter but I am terrified of Adam.  I need to give myself a pep talk before saying a sentence to him.  Seriously.  I have nightmares about Adam glaring at me.  I run from him then find a little cottage.  I go into the cottage and find a group of people with scraggly hair giggling around a fire.  I join in, and soon they all pull out samurai swords and shove them into their stomachs and slice until their guts spill out.  Then they giggled some more.  They offered me a sword but I said no thank you.  After they all fell over laughing and started to pass out I left to find a drug dealer.  I had that nightmare a few times.  I never did figure out what it means.  It's stopped, though.  Any ideas what it means? o.o  It is very confusing.

Row dinner was still fun though.  We went to taco bell.  Brian Davis took forever eating his enchiladas so Steven went in Adam's car instead.  I could have gone, but I always ride with B'Nav because I am scared of Adam, as I have already said.  Then we went to Comp USA and considered buying games and Bawls.  I have never had any Bawls. (Bawls is an energy drink with an insane about of caffeine in it, in case you were wondering.)  I should go buy some sometime and give it a try.  I got a two liter of Mountain Dew from row decorations, though, and have been drinking it all day so far.  I used to drink mountain dew back in ada like it was a necessary thing for my survival.  Anyway, after we left comp usa, we went over to a senior percussionist named calvin's house and we jumped on his trampoline.  I had to wait to jump on it until everyone else got off, though.  It was dress up day for the band and I forgot to bring pants other than my marching stuff for that night so I had to be on by myself to hold down my skirt.  They got thirsty jumping and Adam said that someone should go to check to see if his door was open.  So I went.  While I was going to check they were all laughing and I heard someone say, ""Oh yeah, go make it look like the freshman is breaking the law.""  o.o  I don't get it.  Does it matter that I am a freshman?  I don't understand.  His door was locked, though.  I could have tried the back door but didn't want to try to find it.  It was hidden by the bushes. xD

It was very very cold at the football game.  My whole lips, like not just the red part but all around it too, turned purple.  That is probably where I got sick.  xD 

I was ten minutes late to state finals.  No one yelled at me.  That bothers me.  I don't get yelled at when I am bad.  I wish they would yell at me.  It makes me feel like they are just silently mad at me instead.  If they yelled I would know if they were mad.  But I don't know.  Maybe I can just do anything I want and not get in trouble? o.o?

I lit some candles because it smells very bad in here.  Mom got the carpets cleaned.  We are now one of those annoying families that force people to take their shoes off when they come in even for a moment.  Oh well.  The carpets will be dirty again soon.

(That is early for me.  I am speical.)

I got pumpkins today.  We are carving them tomorrow.  I don't know what I want mine to look like though.

Why is everyone doing their homework right now?  They have all of tomorrow morning too.  Maybe they want to sleep in.

I want to be friends with Nirvana Boy.  I don't know his real name but he was wearing a Nirvana shirt today in English class.  I used to call him the Blonde Boy but he got all his hair cut and now he has a buzz cut thing.  He annoyed me at first but he has been really cool the past few days.  If only I could talk to strangers. xD"

"event","I went to the Japanese Club party today.  That was a lot of fun. ^^

I could not make my hair a mohawk. ):  Not enough time or glue.

We watched Cowboy Bebop the Movie.  It was pretty good.  I had no idea who anyone was.  I zoned out during a lot of it then came back and was like... whoa...  what happened o.o  It was pretty special. xD

We watched another movie too where no one had any idea what the movie was about.  At all.  At any point during the movie. xD  There was this guy called Tetsuo or something and he had magical powers and so did these three wrinkly green kids and Tetsuo made this machine thing blow up or something and then a cult decided to worship him and some guy called akira but akira turned out to be a dismembered courpse and then Tetsuo got his arm blown off and he put together a new one out of random machine parts using his magic to construct it in like half a second.  And then the machine and the magic and Tetsuo all blended into a giant mushy machine monster thingy that smushed everyone but then the wrinkly green kids called akira and used magic to put the courpse back together into a ghost somehow. o.o And akira made a giant blue bubble and swooped up Tetsuo and the kids and vanished.  Then the other people were crying and scared and confused, then they all grinned and the movie was over.  Right before the credits ran, a voice said ""Boku wa Tetsuo"" (I am Tetsuo).  So we were all very confused but there was a lot of blood and gore and fire so we all thought the movie was pretty good.

Oh, one more thing about the movie.  At the cult part, there was a scary old woman riding on a cart thing.  She was starting fires. xD
""Let the pure flames take away your unclean heart and body!  Do not fear for the pain of the body, for the flames will clean your heart!"" that was what she was yelling. x)  Doesn't it make you feel warm inside?"

"event","Lately my life has been very full of sarcastic humor. o.o

The other day in band I felt very anxious and sacred for no reason.  I was totally flipping out over nothing.  Eyes wide and kind of twitching anxious/scared.  It was chaotic around me; people werw switching instruments and playing each others and the purcussionists were napping in the shade of their drums and everyone was out of their spot and runing around and shouting and it was blazing sun but not hot and it's always like that at the start of practice but it was really freaking me out this time for some reason. O.O

And then I screwed up baaad at practice. >>  Like a lot.  Like seven large noticeable mistakes.  There are six songs in our show.  You do the math.  Then I sat down outside and was emo for a while until dad picked us up.  Then he yelled at me for not talking to him or making eye contact the whole ride home. o.o  So there were signs that it would be a chaotic practice/after practice and it WAS.

And then this morning I was sad and worried.  And we went outside during science class.  And I was reciving the sound or something...it's such a useless class I don't pay attention... anyway, I had doodled an emo lookin' guy on the section of the worksheet where we were supposed to draw the experiment.  And I was emo while we were doing the experiment. Whoa. xD

So today when I saw a penny on the ground with tails up I was like oh no! and ran away before I was tempted to pick it up.  And then life was good.  Julie called me a name in Spanish but I didn't know what it was.  And I think I'm getting on Prasanthi's nerves.  Oh well.  It's high school.

I finished the book Speak today.  After the first marking period the book gets good.  I liked David.  He was cool.  Melinda and I would have gotten along very well.  Heather made me mad from the beginning. >> Stupid sell out.

And I attacked Julie with a marker today."

I'm sad that I missed a trip to the cemetery.  Oh well.  I can go with you later, Vik. xD
(Everyone that isn't Vik: I told him I would show him the graveyards around Dublin.  Can't remember why.)

We are twenty pages into the book Speak.  I cannot stand the book Speak at the moment.  I can relate to everything so far and I wish I couldn't.  Only I don't have an art class.  I wish I did.  Band is so fucking stressful for me.  I'm so bad at it.  I wasn't friends with any bandies in middle school so now I don't know what to talk about with the ones I am now around for two solid hours every day. >>

I went to the zoo a few days ago. o: It was a lot of fun.  I stayed longer with my brother.  We ate Sabarros and went through the snake house.  David yelled at a small child to be careful around the snakes.  And we went to see birds.  I liked the birds more than Dave did.  He just sort of sat there while two birds sat on my arm.  But it was fun.  Then we saw kangaroos.  Then I started missing my friends a whole lot, so we called mom and told her we were ready to leave.  But then I had a lot of work to do when I got home and couldn't go blow up soda. ): I wish I could have gone.

Julie might take me to Florida with her family on vacation at some point.  Julie is very nice to me.  She is my friend.  But she still reminds me of a skippy puppy sometimes.

I have a peacock postcard.  It's spifftastic.  I was going to send it to Vik but I sort of want it for my door.  o.o  Does he even like peacocks?  I hope so.  They are amazing.  Well, he owes me a letter anyway, so I will keep it for now. xD

"event","Only three weeks left of band.  Steven's right knee is unreliable so I may have to march again this weekend.  That means I would miss my family thing on Saturday.

I saw another recluse spider today.  It's right outside a junior bandie's house.  If its still there tomorrow I'm going to spray it with scorpian killer or something.  There are so many people that run through there all the time that it could bite someone really easily.  And for some reason no one except me ever notices spiders until a few days after they are there.  I hope they see it and recognize it before it can hurt them.  Unless one of the asshats live there.  Then maybe he can get bitten.  But I don't think so.  I don't think I know the guy.  But you never know.

We have to sell cheese and sausage for band.  As well as christmas stuff.  On the cover of the Christmas magazine there are two 6-year-old lesbian angels about to kiss.  It's pretty funny."

It needs to trip and fall on and gouge its eye out on its mouthpiece.

I went too far back on one move the first time we marched through it that day, and it tried to correct me.  Um...  What the hell?  A lot of people didn't make their spots that time and I was avoiding the trumpets so we don't crash into them, asshat.  I know I was back too far, but there is a reason that after a tiny mistake like that the squad leaders say ""Don't talk about it"" becuase it won't happen again and isn't a big problem if it does. >>

And then I was going back to my spot and I passed through the spot right next to it.  And it yelled, ""Liz, where the hell are you going?""  And I said, ""My spot's back there...""  And he looked around and was like ""ooo yeah"" and I was just like oh my god you know that Adam stands next to you and he is a freaking giant how can you forget?! Ugh. >>

1. No longer mad at Dan; turns out it was not his fault that I was ignored.  I was really mad when I wrote that last thing and I'm too lazy to delete it so I'll do this instead.

2. Even when it's by accident, it still hurts me when you ignore me, especially since I specifically asked if that was going to happen.  That specific time didn't bother me so much but this isn't the first time it's happened and that has been fruterating as I don't see you all much as it is.

3. Kazoku means family in Japanese.

4. I know that it's not as big a deal as I made it out to be, so I'm sorry if I caused offense but I was mad.

5. Dispite the various referances stating otherwise, Dan is, in fact, a male.

Thank you for your time.  This has been a public service announcement.  The regular scedual may now continue."

how could you

M: Green is just so superior.
That god damn blue thinks it's an equal of green!
Pfft!

L: well you're going to have to learn to deal you son of a bitch! blue is equal in the eyes of god and me!

M: No, god wants the world to be pure!

L: pure as the deep blue sea
oh!

The ocean is most often a kind of sickly green-gray, actually!

L: no it is not! not when it is pure! as it was when my family went on vacation!
the water was green only near the shore!

M: Oh no!

L: it was greeny-blue farther out, then most definetely blue!

M: It appears we are losing the battle against blue! Noo!

L: you cannot silence justice!
you fiend!

M: Oh, but green is they face of justice!

L: no, gold is the face of justice!
and as we all know
gold and silver are cousins
and silver is a type of fish
that lives in the blue sea!
so blue is the landlord of justice's cousin!

M: Oh, I should've killed that damn silver long ago!

L: now he is far to late, fool! silver is famous now! if you attempted an assasination of one of america's most beloved stars they would surely catch you!

M: Oh my, say it isn't so!
You must know the truth. I hate blue because, well... A BLUE MAN RAPED MY BEST FRIEND, WHO WAS A CHARMING SHADE OF GREEN!

L: what a shock!
this is impossible! ALL BLUES ARE WOMEN! THE GREEN HAVE SET YOU UP!

M: Green would NEVER lie to me!

M: Oh no, those green bastards!

I'm not saying everyone else has a problem with me, but it's like I'm invisible or like a walking potato with an antenne stuck out of my head to everyone except for him and my friends.

I'm getting a little hungry.  Ate dinner at 5 30 'cause I got hungry.  Have had like two oreos since then.  So yeah.  Little hungry.  But 5 hours no food is nothing.  I really should do my english homework soon.  I just reeeally don't want to.

So I sit here.  My feet are cold.  Let me go sock them.

Okay, feet have been sufficently socked. ^^ Now...

I do not have whooping cough and my walking pnemonia is almost gone.  Those are both good pieces of news.

Octoberfest is soon!!! Yay! =D Even though all my friends decided to go to a dance that they are going to have for the next four years instead of go to a German festival with me which I may not be allowed to take anyone again (I am being passive aggressive ^^) and only two of them have real reasons not to come, I still really want to go myself.  Oh, no, three of them have real reasons.  o.o  Yeah.

Who they are you prolly know.  So yep.

Four if you count Kathy who must stay to sport her collar.

Wrote down my name and email.  Went to band; forgot white shirt, had to borrow one of Adam's.  Kate was sick; Adam had to teach Steven all of Kate's positions and stuff in about a half hour so he could march her place.  We walked, about seven minutes, to a free meal, and everyone whined about it.  ""It's so hot.  I'm so tired.  My instrument is too heavy.""  We get free fucking food and it's five minutes away.  Oh gee.  And it's Chipotle!  Then Julie complained that all the burritos had beans on them and I was just like.... yeah... you do that.  I don't care; not my problem.

Marched in game.  Sucked horribly.  Found that I didn't care much about that.  Went home, had ""disscussion"" with my parents, and then called Vik.  We mostly sit in silence on the phone.  That's what's happening right now.  w00t.  Oh, and I took a shower.  Yup.

Vik has been sick all weekend! D:  Mom won't let me go visit him.  She's either cheap or lazy. >(  It's very insulting.  Granted, she doesn't know we hooked up, and I don't intend to tell her.  Not yet, anyway.  Maybe never.  She doesn't need to know.  Well she might.  I don't know.

School tomorrow! NO.  IT WILL NOT BE SO.  >(  School is a horrible thing; designed to make me sad and separate me from those who care about me.  It seems like it, anyway.  Maybe not.  And if I don't go, who will feed the salamander?  Well, this one is for you, Simon the salamander.  

Well, Vik tried to teach me to count to ten in hindi so I could tell what number B'Nav and Adam were at when they count that in marching band, but it turned into a I'll-list-all-the-swear-words-I-know-in-hindi thing.  He knows a lot of them.  I only remember choda.  Chouda is fourteen.  Very useful, I know.  I bet you that I won't be able to pronounce either of those.  I do know the numbers et and teen, which is one and three.  So there you go.  I know four words. xD

I talked to Megan and we talked about dreams and poems.  Megan's cool like that.

I watched Saw at Dan's house.  It was very good.  It was only tense in one part; but always very interesting.  The serial killer was a genius; you didn't know who he was until the end.  It was so great; I loved it.  I loved the cop.  I was very sad when he got sliced.  Then happy when he turned out to be alive.  Then sad again when he was shot.  Then I laughed and laughed with the dolls; I loved the dolls.  I like dolls which is probably why.  I never thought they were creepy; even now when I see 'creepy' dolls I think they are absolutely adorable.  I don't know why.  Perhaps I really do feel a need to take care of everyone.  But there are people I really just want to let die and suffer.  Everyone else I rarely care if they live or die.  Perhaps it's only cool people I care about.  I've always loved dolls.  But yeah, you get it.

I have money in a vase now.  I need a lid for my money vase.  I don't like the idea of an open top on it; though you can't get to the money through the tiny hole at the top.  You have to tip it.

My grandpa is almost completely better!  He drove down here today and can walk without a walker and is getting his tan back and fed squirrels the other day!!!  ^^  I'm so happy that he's getting so much better.  Still not how he used to be, but I'll take this one over the one a few months ago.

I feel very confused.  At school today I just kept thinking, ""This is great, but it can't be my life.  There's no way this can be my life.""  And if you guys lived in my shoes for a few days, you would agree with me.  No one in any of my classes hate me, though I see a few faces that are hard for me to forgive. (Robert Carmono... x_x)  I love to play my instrument(s), but I can't stand the fucking marching, and it seems like Ahbirnav is picking on me specifically.  I know he isn't, but damn it seems like it.  Just because I'm tired and still don't know the drills and stuff very well.  And wow, marching would be sooo much more fun if I had a close friend in it.  But none of this bothered me until Dan called me today and talked about what you guys were doing.

Then my perfect mood between apathy and exaustion snapped and I yelled at Dave, which got me in trouble, then I ate dinner where mom is trying to be all nice and all it's doing is pissing me off, because someone being nice to me is not what is going to fix this, but it's confusing because I don't know what I or anyone else can do to fix it.  Then I went on a bike ride and called Dan back.  He's going to be the Cheat tomorrow, which is cool.

I'm hungry all the time but I never feel like eating now.  Like, I know that's what I'm feeling, but it's like I think it's an illution.

Ooo, I just figured out why I've been so upset... I'm such an idiot.  xD  No wonder.

I rarely, if ever, trust even my dearest friends.  I really haven't tursted them in the past but over the last six months I started trusting you guys a lot, and now I feel like you all don't miss me.  That's why I was upset.  And what makes it worse is that the only thing I have in commen with Jenny right now is that we are riding the same bus.  God, this has been so bloody obvious... I feel dumb. o_o

And no, it's not your fault, this is one of my problems.  You are in no way responsable for my abandonment issues.  I wonder why I feel the need to be reassured that I am loved, or at least liked?  My mother always told me she loved me, but eventually it felt like she was obligated to say it, not that she really felt it.  Perhaps I want to avoid people feeling obligated to like me?  I don't know.  I'm a pretty screwed up person, but wow am I preaching to the chouir."

"event","A true Story. A religion teacher assigned her class an essay on what
makes a good Christian. One student wrote about praying nightly, say no
to abortion, banning gay marriage, and donating money. The other
student wrote about talking to God and allowing people to enjoy their
lives, and supporting gay marriage. The day the teacher was to hand the
papers back, she called up the second student and told him she would
pray for him when he went to hell. The student asked why would he be
going to hell, and why he got an F on his paper. The teacher told him
that Catholisim is against gay marriage. The student looked at her for
a minute, then said aloud, ""I'm gay."" The teacher kicked him out of
class as if he had said fuck or worshiped Satan. A girl in the back of
class who had a boyfriend and was obviously straight got up and left
too.

If you would leave the classroom, repost this. It
doesn't matter if you're straight, bi, or gay. It doesn't matter if
you're Catholic or not. Everyone is a human being and deserves
happiness."

"event","I AM FINALLY HOME.  YAY.  

But ugh, it's so hot in here and I have another cold.  That's what you get with at least six girls and a chaperone living in a small cabin with... limited... showering facilities.

I have a lot to say.  But mostly I missed everyone and I don't feel like typing a lot.  So I won't.

I felt really back for Ahbernov.  His name is taking too long to type and I spelled it wrong anyway so I'm gonna call him B'nav, his nickname, in my LJ.  In one night he had to deal with at least two emotional breakdowns, one from Kate, the other tenor sax, and Jill, one of the altos.  I'll tell you why I hate it later, but one of the creatures there is a horrible piece of shit and needs to die.  It's called Alex.  I'll tell you more later.

I WISH I WAS GOING TO COFFMAN. ;_;  It makes me more sad now than it did all those other years I knew.  I hate knowing that it will be really really hard to make new friends, and I will have almost no time to spend with the few I do make or have.  I do not make good first impressions anywhere.  Ever.  None of the friends I have now liked me when they first met me.  Oh dear, I appear to have made myself emo.  I should stop, but I really don't want to.  It's hard to pull yourself out of a slump.  But I think I will anyway, because this isn't going anywhere.  I'll go make up a song about Chex Mix."

"event","I had a freaky nightmare that I know you'll just love to hear, Meep!  You will love it!  It totally freaked me out though, and I put the light on for about two hours after I woke up.  Okay, I'll tell you all now:

The world has flooded and the remaining humans all live in these strongholds underwater.  So when they need to kill someone through the death penalty or something like that, they just throw them out this hatch and the person drowns.  Bada bing bada boom.

So they're gonna kill this serial killer, and right before he falls into the hatch, he grabs me and drags me in with him, thinking that they'll send something in to get me and have to pull him back up too.  But after a very brief discussion, they decide it would be safer if he dies now, even if someone else has to die with him.

My sister overhears this and decides that this is intolerable and jumps in after me.  (Apparently, in the future, I have a sister.)  So she jumps in and swims over to us, and the serial killer is all pissed off.  He swims over, he had tied me up somehow with rope he magically pulled out of nowhere, and starts littereally ripping her apart limb from limb.  All I could really see was a girl getting vicously attacked, then a lot of bubbles and crap, and then a bloody, oozy, fleshy mass of what was perviously my sister floating in the water.  Well, then he swam back over to me, but that seems sort of obvious, so yeah.

We're near a shipwreak, and he finds this rusty dagger, and slices apart some of the sail to blindfold me.  So now I'm blindfolded, but I can still see glances of what's going on.  I can talk though, and I ask him what he's doing, and then where he's going becuase he's swimming away.  I know he's going over to my sister's remains, but I don't know what he did there.

So then he swims back over to me, and I guess he did this to shut me up or make an example of me or something along those lines, starts stabbing me like, well, a crazed serial killer.  o.o  Yeah.  So I kinda go ""Ah!"" when I realize what's happening but shut up after that little sound for whatever reason.  He keeps this up for a while though, and he's mostly stabbing along my arms, upper torso, and head.  He ties me back to him, and starts swimming back towards the stronghold, when I get one of those weird feelings that you can only get when you are either in a dream or when you've just realized something incredably important about something or someone you care deeply about.

I ask, ""Wait...  You picked something up, didn't you?""

But this guy doesn't talk, duh, so I turn and get one of those sight flashes through my blindfold, and he is carrying something fleshy, and I am looking outragously bloody.  And he is carrying my face, and I look at my face, and it's ripped off, and the only thing keeping my eyeballs from falling out is the blindfold.

And at that moment, I know he's going to use my torn off face as a mask to get into the stronghold.  Then I wake up.

It doesn't sound scary now, but at the time I was really freaked out,  I put the light on for two hours and reviewed my music.

Fin."

"event","Gimme a minute...  It'll come back to me.  (The time is 8:14 now.)


Oh!  It's these dreams I keep having!  (Now it's 8:16)

A few nights ago I had a dream about the charecters from Malcom in the Middle.  The Malcom creature had told his brothers how to curse someone with a snake.  His brothers do it, and find it to be sucessful.  Then they start doing it to him.  Malcom goes to his dad to tell him to stop them, but his dad is hesitant because then, for whatever reason, he would have to tell them about Malcom's big-ass football helmet.  And he doesn't want to do that because then they would be jelous.  Okay, sure, it's a dream.  But I know from experiance that whenever I remember I dream I have then it means something.  So I looked up the things that it meant.

I know that snakes can represent a variety of things, but in the dream they kept trying to bite the Malcom creature.  That represents hidden fears.  A shrine, like the one they had to set up outside his bedroom, means I'm concentrating too much of my energy on one aspect of my life.  A helmet means that I need to keep my thoughts and/or ideas closely gaurded.  And, seeing as everytime they said that, they called it a big-ass football helmet, it must be a big-ass thought or idea.  As far as I can tell, that means that I have a secret fear or a hidden fear that needs to be closely gaurded and am spending too much of my time on it, and the people I tell want to keep it a secret from the people it effects.

The other dream I had was a group of boy scouts climbing a mountain and being very happy about it.  It also involved some sort of video game and me looking very, very goth while playing it.


To see a mountain represents some sort of major obsticle in your life that you need to overcome, and to me, boy scouts are the goodie-two-shoe people that I always want to outdo because they act so nice they are almost not human.  For me to be gothic represents something, I know it, but I can't figure it out.  I think I was partially upset because I either could not or would not climb the mountain.  Maybe the boy scouts went in my place?  I dunno.  The video game represents my ability to control or manipulate others, so maybe I did make the boy scouts climb the mountain for me... It can also mean that I'm trying to escape and not face the problems in my real life.

Tell me what you guys think about this, please.  I also want to know which seems most probable, and any diffrence in interpretations.

Oh, and I remember that the boy scouts were eating cookies.  Cookies mean that I will let trivial little problems bother me, but I think it will mean that I will let other people's problems bother me, because I wasn't the one eating the cookies."

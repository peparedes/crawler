"event","i could sit here not smoking cigarettes for the rest of the day
i could sit here humming to myself
i could sit here biting my fingernails down to blood
and probably be fine
or probably get that kind of crazy that only walking can cure
at the end of me is just nothing
at the end of the glass is a clear circle
an empty house begging to store all your secrets 
a puncture wound that won't shut up

i'll tell you the truth now about why i moved here
at night the city lights up its fog
a sick orange sheet that hovers over all of us
waiting to fall like relief from heat
but never does
i am it the glow inside the shell
the combusting neon inside the tube

a million eyes turned up wavering and wanting to cry
but staying dry shaking like locusts before swarming
look out at the wall you made around yourself
a structure for you to marvel over like the pyramids
a mysterious architecture that is there for no remembered reason
its lines all but invisible when its lit up like that
soaked through with that teary luminescent orange
the light from you trying to escape
a friction burn from one failed attempt scraping against another
until they flare to life smoulder die and darkness
clamps down warm and obliterating over your face

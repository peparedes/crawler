I procceded to inform everyoen i had to pee, I was slightly angery about haveing it sound like a sin i was up to early but thats just because i was tired. So i came up to my room and oh god i played the playsation for a but till i felt my brain was rotted enough. I went on line to relize allt he lazyasses were indeed still asleep. SO i took a 2 hour shower wich impressed myself actuly i mean a 30 minete shower is long for me. but 2 hours hot damn. I relized my parents weren't home and was sad because i was hungery. so i sat ont he chair and watched stuff i had recorded and did laundry. Mom and dad cam ehome with coffee it was plesent i watched the shows and when i was done the normale tv came on and it was muppets singing bible things I had to leave. and i came up stiars to wish Jon a happy birthday. Which means almost all my friendds are 18 now. besides Hope. But I will be 18 soon enough and can buy porn and smoke and a lottery ticket. proubly wont buy porn though gross much. 
Ihave to laugh now because i was relfecting on life in my 2 hour shower. and i used to bitch about how much everyone ealse changed, and how i wasnt close wihtmy fmaily and watned to be. But now. I relize if anyones cahnged its me pulling a complete 180 this year and i mean sure i woudl liek to be closer with my family at times but really i am closer with some peoepl in my family and you know what i am ok with that. I mean i will never tell my family everything i do when they arent around. But i know if i ever relaly needed someoen to tlak to i could go to them. 
the othr day actuly someoen pointed out to me that i cahnged alot and i denied it then they point out everything that i do differntly and holy crap i didnt relize it but they are right. But i am ok wiht it i mean real frineds will deal wiht the cahnges and others will leave me and i dont relaly think i have many fake friends left and so far all my real friends are ok wiht the changes and have been there threw the bad and the good and the hard and the fun. And thats what friends are for. Its sad though i mean i proubly wont see alot of them after high school wich is done in.. 8 months. so scary.
Oh I have tons of art projects done. Gonna post picters excpt not the ugly ones. just to rpove i have some art talent if not alot."

So anyway i mean i automaticly like him till i find a reason to not which is weird because i have never liked anyone of my sisters boy frineds even the ones i just heard about they all just weren't good enough or just i didnt like them. But i mean i havent really found a reason to hate this one and belive me i have tried. And then i mean what if hes the one i will finaly be getting what i want i sappose i mean a brother so ok hes not blood it would be a brother  in law but i mean i have alwasy wanted a brother and i can handle just a brother in law its good enough for me. But then it wont be just the hevey sisters anymore it will be sarah april and jacub or the hevey sisters and the guy. and that doesnt have a cool ring to it. But then heres the big scary thing what if he hates me. I mean i dont think i oculd handle that. i mean i waited so long for a brother or brother in law i dotn hate him i cant find a reason to and then he hates me then i will never have a cool brother or see my sister. all in all i am over thinking baout soemthing i shouldnt and now y mind is wrapp up in the fact there is razor burn all down my leg. and i am gonan really try to stop calling jacub hitler."

went and saw the chainsaw massicure and wanted to thorw up seeing as i am not one to want to see scary movies i wanted to go just because peopel on the bus said it was good...they lie the liitle lier faces. and the fact its based on real life is gross. i mean how horrbale. i mean it happened no where near maine but still how scary. 
When i home todya i also noticed messgaes? HUmm lisen. some lady was all I dont want the cable in the public schools bitch bitch bitch moan moan moan i mean thats nice for her and great she has 3 kids in public school. I think we need it the school currrent events in our schoool are from like 1983 which if you havent relized arent current i think it would be a great teaching guid for english media and history clases. I want a chance of abetter bettter school. i mean our school is about to loose our accradaation if we dont change something and i think one of themaine proublems is we are a small underdated school we dont have nayting nice its rundown all the kids know it and figuer why bother i got to a rundown high school its pointless. there are days i think why bother the school officles arent trying to clean this place up i am doomed to be a small town trash the rest of my life its not worth it. But it is in a way. i mean i can go to coallge in maine then transfere someone nice like colorado.

To ngiht is one of those night si guess I know i should have been in bed long ago seeing as how sick i got. But i knew i needed to do my school then I fel the need to talk to hope and to tell charlotte she was my best frined and everything I usely get liek this about my sister. I usely have jsu sudden urges to need ot tell her I love her and miss her. To just ask for adivce. Other times i get so cought up in liveing at home how it is now i completly forget mys ister ever lived at home and it feels weird i feel like an awful person. 
But i have found how ever corny this is that if i jsut play my jewl cd its ok well abto my sister it was the first cd i ever got that wasnt the lion king or the muppets and i got it because my sister told my mom i woudl like it for chistmas. i remnber the retarded stuff like that. 
I remnber sitting in freshman scince so alone. and getting the huge project and so scared that i was gonan do it alone. But then charlotte asked if i would work wiht her. I remnber hope used to tlak to me in band and i just kidna smiled and said hi but never really knew who it was and it didnt click till  8th grade year gym class. 
I dont knwo i feel like and ass and that i dont tell peoepl how much they mean to me enough i get to wrappe dup in other thigns and i mean to i jsut never get aroudn to it till its to late kinda like my math homeowrk i mean to do it but then i always end up rushed last minete. So i want to trya nd show peoepl i appreacte them more i want peoepl to know i really am glad theya re my friends and my sister my sister my family my family and i actuly want to get my school one on time not rushed. and not jsut saying that becuse writieng the essy tongiht wasnt fun. I really want to try and be better. I mean maybe its just the fact that i dont know where any of this will be in a year. or less I mean i know my sister will be my sister my fmaily my family but my frineds will we still be frineds or will collage be to much of a strech and i dont want colaleg to be were we breka off and people to neer relize how much i appreacted them i guess. your senor year relaly makes you look at life. and much you suck at it. 
I did have a good day though I got my inter liebary loan books mr.hedstrom said hi charlottes face was funyn in latin when the techer was being stuiped. and his stick or fat figuers were so funny i coudlnt keep it in anymore. Mrs.decker was nice today and so wasnt mrs martin she actuly completly understood why everyone fell asleep in class today. 
I also got glitter and stuff so i can do soem art projects. 

the end of work was fun. I even got a band aid from guy the emt its tradtion we cant have a funtown year wiht out him haveing to bange up my sister or I. I am glad its done so i can focuse on friends and school and collage and family and stuff but i am sad becuse there were some peoepl but i figuer all the important peoepl i willkeep in contact with."

And happy little kids are better then asshole teens. So that was exciting and it felt like every emplyee who wasnt working was in the park. I also got a really weird message on my phone from some weird guy? or maybe a deep voiced female. It was kidna odd. I figuer the voice mail pick up would give away they had the wroung number but maybe not. 
I then got picked up by mother and we went and ate food! well i did she ate the fish dad caught. And we went to the air port to see jekka because I wanted to. We sat in the place were your car cant be unattended for an hour and watched the securty dude ticket and tow a car. then we moved the garge becuse i was cold. and waited for jekka. She came off the plane we said hello hug the usle. THen i remnbered i needed night hours so i snagged the keys and got ready to leave the airport on the way out i was still in work wear. and the lady takeing our money talked ot me abotu hwo she worked there last year and wanted to know all about how the park was. but thats ok becuse she was old and we all know old ladys are cute and nice. I have abad habit of not remnbering t turn on my head lights or turnign them off. so i didnt turn my actule headlights on till somewhere on a road after wondering why i couldnt see anything. and I also relized i coudlnt tell if the green was an arrow or a green thign for me so i went thtrew it anyway! I think i might start wearing my glasses when i drive in citys. 
I also got a call form some guy who got it from some friedn who knew a friend who knew me who had my cell phone number? and called and asked me i i woudl ask sarah out offor him. Saddly he didnt leave a name or numbe ri recognize so i cant call and inform him hes a retard."

I have been in a mood for the past few weeks not really describable just everything all in one. vary icky moood. Just the relization that collage is soon and high school is over soon and just other thigns about myself. Theres so much i want to fix or do and not enough time left. I mean there are relizations i made that take prioty over otehr things like the fact my relationshipo with my family is really kidna rocky i mean its gotten better but i want to be closer and more open like to the point where if i really needed someone to call i wouldnt feel weird or scared to call one of them i mean i will never be as close with my aunt or uncle as sarah is i just want to make a better closeness with my entire family as a whole before I leave for collage. I also want to be more open i mean i have worked on that alot but i still hold alot of thigns or dont act on thigns because i am to scared of what could happen or what might be or others feelings.
I also want to make my friendships with certin people stronger. I also want better time mangment and work harder.

I talked to my sister last night which helped alot in gettign out of my lazy gross feelings i cried when we hung up for really no reason just cried.

You'll never know what I'm capable of
Because I hold it all inside
You'll never know what I'm capable of
I'm not quite sure myself
I hold it all back
Afraid to show my true potential
This courage I always seem to lack"

"event","First, I just made and am eating some vegan latkes, which turned out to be incredibly delicious, and don't really have much to them, so definitely a keeper!  Second, mom bought easter chocolate (not much, and for the family rather than me), and said she couldn't find anything without milk in it, but there was chocolate covered almonds with ""just a little milk in them"" (read: milk chocolate covered almonds) and a couple of Kinder Surprises for the bird.  Now THAT was fun: I gave mom the chocolate and put together the toy, under the watchful and eager eye of Bird, who upon receiving it spent ten minutes sitting on my knee on one foot, the other wrapped around his new sailboat as his beak persistently gnawed at it from all angles until he had finally taken it all apart again.  The nice thing about Kinder Surprise toys is when he had decimated the boat, I put all the pieces back together and he started all over again.  Fun for the whole family!!!  ~lol~

Third, mom and I had a bit of an argument yesterday - I'm writing my take home exam (read: final paper) on the issues with development work glomming women and children into one category for health interventions, and the problems that ends up causing for societal roles of women, specifically that the increased focus on women's roles as reproducers and childrearers undermines attempts to improve gender equity in developing countries.  There's a lot more points and details in there, but I already have to write it once for the paper, I'm not going to recap it all here.  Anyways, I asked mom to give me a bit of an argument for comprehensive services for women and children from a more medical viewpoint, seeing as she's part of that system, and given I stand ideologically far more with gender equity in the long term through structural and societal changes than with gender needs in the short term related to health of women and children individually.  And we argued.  I left after it stopped being productive for my paper and before I got seriously affronted.  I had a nice chat about it with a friend of mine over dinner afterwards, and generally about strange things moms believe in despite generally left-leaning values.  And today, mom apologized - well, sort of.  She said she thought about it last night and realized the other side of the story and what I was trying to say, like it sunk in, and we had a reconciliatory chat today (aided by the paper I'm using that looked at a microfinance intervention for women and the huge impact it made reducing intimate partner violence).  So all is well again, though I'm again surprised that my ideology is not middle-of-the-road but is actually quite left-leaning.  Says the vegan ""professional"" woman who refuses to have kids or believe she needs a relationship with a man (or woman) in order to have a fulfilling life.  What, not everybody thinks that way?!?"

"event","I don't know if I mentioned it, but for my 25th birthday I went vegan.  I've become vegan a number of times over the past five years, but something about tying it into an important event like my 25th birthday really made the difference.  It's been lots of months since then and I'm comfy with it now.  Cheese looks a bit gross, which is a wonderful change from looking way too appetizing.  I'm a little nervous about going away this summer travelling, but between Happycow.net (veggie/vegan restaurant directory) and staying in places with a kitchen so I can make my own meals, I think I'll be fine.  

I get back just in time for my 26th b-day, and am wondering if I shouldn't go raw for it.  I mean, I've had such success with the b-day ""present to myself"" of being vegan, that surely tying raw to a b-day will also be mostly if not totally successful.  Part of me worries about pushing too far, worried I will slip back, but I will have been vegan for a year at that point, and just how long was I expecting to wait anyways?  How long will I be worried about slipping back?  And am I just excusing myself from the problems I fear I will face going raw, after so long of vegan success that I'm becoming rather proud of myself (still working on social situations, but waaay better!)?  On the other hand I drive myself crazy knowing I'm not doing my body any favours anytime I eat wheat or sushi or soy mochas?  I was never particularly good at finding a good balance or slowly moving towards something; if I try and slowly change over to raw I'm afraid I'll never make it.  And that's disappointing especially now, when I know people personally who have already made it over and are living happy healthy fulfilling lives secure and pleased with their eating habits.  Isn't that what I went away for last year, at least part of what I went away for?  To meet those people, to get a fresh start, to learn that I can eat whole fresh ripe raw organic fruits and veggies, to the exclusion of everything else?  And how do I get back there - wait that's an easy question, I know how, I've done it before and felt better for it, and I know why as well - the question really is WHEN?  When am I ready to do it again, and ready to keep it up?  Or is it enough just to start, and not worry about maintenance, just one meal at a time?

I just read a little something about Lillian Muller, she's been raw since she was 27 and is gorgeous at 57; Doug went raw at 25 and is incredibly healthy at 56, and I'm about that age and know I'd better get a move on.  What am I waiting for?

OK, then I'd better get some more work done here then I'll go out and buy some bananas for lunch... never too early to start..."

"event","Or really, the inability to taste everything, at least not all at once.  Sad, really.  I like to do everything at once, it keeps me happy and hopping.  Other times I like to do nothing at all, but it seems to me I've had a lot of that lately, and I'm almost ready to move on to doing everything again.  Not that I really can - I'm entering exam season which makes my time outside of studying somewhat limited for a few weeks, and then I'm going away for three months so right now is not really a good time to start anything new.  Also, there is that evil and annoying problem called MONEY.  I hate worrying about money.  My life goal is not to be rich, but to be able to do what I would like to do, whatever that happens to be, while having at least the illusion of security that comes with a paycheque.  I'm willing to compromise... but sometimes that takes the form of never getting around to doing something that I feel would be tremendously positive for me as an experience.

Take acting classes, for example.  Two years ago now I audited an acting class - basically I just showed up and sat in the back corner watching the process, and joined in the cold script readings at the end.  It was meaningful, moving, inspiring, terrifying, and very very honest, intimate and vulnerable.  And I always meant to go back... Two years later I haven't yet, but I think I'm getting closer, coming out of my shell and feeling the need for personal challenge more and more.  Probably since my teacher left the continent I have not had enough boundary-pushing for my taste, though I think school has helped push me in terms of presentations and speaking up/leading group work.  But since my JD marathon (which I'm still on), I have continually been reminded that I want to go back and take those classes, even just for a year or so, really to work on my self-consciousness, image, and all the barriers and boundaries I put up around myself that say I am a certain way and I cannot and will not be any different.  And the idea of taking those classes is still terrifying, and I think it will take quite an effort just to go to them, at least for a while.  But, like a good exposure therapist, I know that to get over those fears it will be necessary to keep going to them until I can be in the situation without feeling anxious sensations, or long enough that those anxious sensations pass.  Goodness knows I was like that with singing - I used to come between 15 to 30 minutes late for lessons, not to mention calling in sick unnecessarily, because I was so nervous about going and singing and working on those high notes... now I LOVE it, I just love it, and can't bear to stop.  Acting I think will be the same way, something that once I have a few years of exposure I will be so in love with the process that I won't be able to bear giving it up... not to mention the kind of person that I could become.  Not a famous actor, of course; I'm far too private a person to want to be a celebrity, but I will have a different personality and different outlook and different boundaries of self, hopefully a good long way further from what I have now.  But right now, the thing that's holding me back, or at least my excuse for holding back, is money.  I don't have enough of it to justify spending it on acting lessons.  Fortunately for me, I don't have to worry about this till I get back from my trip, at which point I will find out just how much I have spent in those three months and how much school will cost me in the fall, and then I can reevaluate if I have the money for lessons or not.  Alternatively, I can join the chorus of an amateur opera company in the fall instead, which will be very good for me, but I'm not sure when I'll be ready for something like that, nor the amount of time and energy it will require from me during the school year.  I have a sneaking suspicion I should learn a whole lot more Italian than none before I agree to memorizing a great many operas... well if I'm lucky they will choose one in German and then I'll be ok :)

Yes, I know I ramble, but that's what the blog is for... basically getting everything that was on my mind on to paper so it doesn't keep flitting around my head like a butterfly or flea, depending on what kind of thought it is.  And speaking of random thoughts, a few nights ago I had a dream I was in Germany and talking to people, but when I woke up I couldn't remember if they were talking in German or English.  I had looked forwards to one day dreaming in another language, but its funny that I don't remember, and now I can't 'look back on the night I first dreamed in German' because I'm not sure if its happened yet!

Oddly enough, we have four Indian musicians kind of randomly staying with us for four nights, in our under-construction house... I don't really know what to think, but I know most of that time I won't be home anyways as I'll be at work (like today and tomorrow) or school (Friday) so won't do a lot of interacting... I'm not really sure I want to, I'm in a ""leave me alone"" mode involving homework, tv, headphones and late nights, and don't really like being disturbed.  Sometimes basic socializing feels like a disturbance... usually when it involves other people in my house :P

Can't wait to hear back from the french guys telling me where I'll be staying in QC, I found some good flights that I can get cheap on air miles but don't know if I need to fly into Montreal or Quebec City, so have to put off booking anything till they get back to me.  Sigh..."

"event","Amazing!  Two years since my last post!

Well, interesting things have happened in two years.  First, I went on a 26-day water fast last spring, which was a fascinating experience; I actually found handling the associated emotions more difficult than the physical weakness from lack of food.  And for a long time after, too - it took about six  months (during three of which I saw a psychiatrist) to get over the churned up mess of emotions that were uncovered during the process.  Of course, now I feel way lighter than I did before, I assume because I'm not carrying around so much past baggage.

Then I got into a degree program, so am just finishing the first year of my Masters.  Fun stuff!  Very cool people, part-time degree so I'm not drowning in homework, and a good excuse to only work half time (though of course most of the money I make seems to go into paying for school, but it does mean a nice tax return).  Plus now I feel like I'm getting somewhere, reaching into the future.  

Or at least I did, till a couple of weeks ago, after finishing two major papers, at which point I took a break.  I needed it, I think, but the problem is I'm still ON it.  Finals are approaching, and I feel like I'm just doing what I need to get by, especially at school, instead of getting the most I can out of it.  And my break consists of a Johnny Depp marathon, which started with Sweeney Todd and then went all the way back to 21 Jump Street... The only other actor I've done this for is David Tennant (and I still haven't see ""Takin' Over the Asylum"" yet), but Johnny Depp is posing much more of a problem for me, since he's done <i>so much stuff</i>!

I dunno what to do about this laziness, I mean, it's not eating too much into what I need to do - work as usual is a mix of overefficiency and slacking off, evening out into getting what I'm expected to do done, and all my schoolwork does get completed in the end - but it's certainly eating into what I <i> could </i> do, like prepare for finals or work on my French or practice singing or spend more time with friends and fellow students... maybe it's something I should just leave and assume it will blow over when I've made it through a few more movies.  Or maybe it's just related to stress coping for school and finals, or taking my mind off my trip this summer (which I'm looking forwards to intensely, but is going to be rather outside of my comfort zone, as are many things in life).  Or maybe it's a product of a poor sleeping schedule - I should probably go to bed before 1am and thus be able to get up and do things in the morning, rather than sleeping in and making excuses.  I'm just not sure.  I have a feeling I'm wasting my time, but if it's enjoyable time wasting and not too disruptive to the things I HAVE to do (school, work), then isn't it ok?  Or is avoidance of social time because I'd rather watch TV than go out to dinner with friends also a form of functional impairment?"

"event","So life's interesting.  We went to see my teacher this weekend, and it was all good till a little bit at the end when I was asked not to sing so high when we do zikir, as it was distracting to a few people.  My teacher apparently thinks it's ok ""if that's how she can join in,"" but I didn't mean to be disruptive... I will not sing so high next time.  Of course that means I also won't be able to sing very loud as my voice simply doesn't go low enough to hit the notes we would sing, but that may also be a good thing, what with zikirs being group projects not individual ones.  Course, I can hear my ego whining and complaining, first hurt that it can't show off, then rebelling and, pouting, declaring that it won't sing at all... yea so my ego is immature, what can I say.

I may be working less hours than originally planned; I was going to make up for the hours I missed this summer by working four days a week, but I don't think I can do that and keep my sanity.  Argh!  Annoying a bit because I still need the money, but good as I would rather not go insane and/or frustrated at work.  Three days a week is so perfectly handleable it's wonderful.  Four not so much so!  Does that make me lazy or a slacker, I hope not...

I'm still worried about finding work in the spring.  *shivers nervously*.  There's something very scary about giving up my job, especially when I owe money to the bank and have some bills to pay yet (car being the most substantial one, which will be done next August).  I kind of wish I could have left when I was on more solid financial footing, but it's not something I can do anything about now... even now I'm having a hard time saving money to pay off debts, as I keep getting distracted by things I'm doing here, like school and classes and things of the sort.  Anyways, I'm sure I'll find something when I'm looking for something, I just don't know what that something is, which scares me just a little...

I feel a bit stuck right now, which is a bit odd, I think it's related to the fact I'm still where I am despite all sorts of plans and big decisions that I'm making and that are going on around me.  I still work on M/W/F, I still live at home, I still eat badly especially on work days, I still am tired in the mornings and feel like just staying home and watching TV sometimes.  And yet all these things are being changed around me, like leaving work and having a boyfriend and going back to school finally and going to Central America for two months and things of the sort!  I mean, aren't those life-changing enough?  Why is it my life doesn't feel like it's changing?  Maybe each individual moment isn't that different, or perhaps it's because I'm at work right now, or perhaps it's because I'm tired, having spent the weekend away and last night at my boyfriend's house.  And so the world doesn't seem different, it seems like the same tired old self it's always been.  Which is not the right feeling for me now...

Well I leave for NC in two days if that makes me feel better :)  Shakes up my world a bit?  Maybe not as much as Central America will next spring... did I mention how happy I am that I will be in the sunshine while here it's cold, grey, and damp?  For two whole months!  And I can even learn some Spanish while I'm down there and feel like I'm doing something worthwhile :)  A couple of other things happen along the way that make regular life a bit exciting, including weekends with my teacher, NC, maybe going to Edmonton, a few Buddhist meditation retreats, dance team performances, and sema offerings to the public.  Not to mention schoolwork and the fun that comes with learning...  and the fabulous company of that other half of me :) Hooray!

So is it free time that I'm craving or more meaningful things to do?  Or just some sort of more obvious outcome of these changes that I've made and am making, so that the effort of the decisions doesn't feel wasted and I don't feel so stuck?"

"event","Someone said to me the other day, ""One of the things I really like about you is you never let yourself be held down.""  It was meant metaphorically in case anyone is literal-minded and imagining a tussle in the corridors, but it was meaningful... if not... well let's just say my self-image is having a hard time keeping up with my personality!  ~lol~  

So, re: work, I have given my notice; re: play, I'm planning my vacation.

Funnily enough I did talk to my supervisor at work and officially gave her the heads up, i.e. ""notice"" that I would be leaving.  Except that instead of two weeks notice I gave her four months notice!  And yet what did she say, she said that she wanted me to put it off even longer, and was trying to convince me to stay on for fewer hours, I think anything to keep a grip on me... but as I've got a trip to Central America in January through, well at least through mid-February, it kind of nixed that temptation.  Which is a good thing and really somewhat in my plan; I don't want to be tempted to stay longer now that I've finally gotten up the courage to leave, and I know that a source of income, a job I know I can do, and the fear of uncertainty when it comes to finding a new job, along with the desire to leave my work in as good a situation as possible would be too much for me to resist.  But by leaving the country, it's like a true deadline...

More things abound.  I wanted to take a few classes this fall and I got my wish, I'm now enrolled in a German course on-campus, a Kinesiology course by distance education, and a Spanish course by community centre.  Hurrah!  Mind you of course that could get a bit on the busy side... We'll see how it goes!

Working four days a week now instead of three to make up for the ""missed"" days this summer; it's in heavy quotes and I don't want to explain why right now...

Also always looking to the future and what I want to do next - course planning and trip planning!  I was hoping to do a EU tour in summer 09 but I may have to put it off for a year or two to save up some more money first... Also one of the two universities I go to (yea don't ask why I'm at two) has ""summer term exchanges"" so I can take just a summer off Vancouver and live and study somewhere else in the world without taking a whole year off (as I would have to at my original university).  Hurrah!

Course I'm torn, as I always am, about working full-time vs. part-time.  Full-time means I could save up a bunch of money and then leave the country to spend it.  Part-time means I could save up less money but have more time and energy to do things in the city on an ongoing basis, like classes and things.  Hard to choose, maybe I can get something not full-time nor half-time but instead something inbetween?  Or two part-time things so I don't get bored by doing the same thing all the time?

Aiyaa the decisions to be made.  But it's all in good fun!"

"event","Sort of like spring cleaning, but on a much more massive scale.

So I have some time off this summer, and I'm going to do a massive cleaning.  I seem to have held on to a lot of old stuff over the years, not just physical.  Actually it seems to me that most of it is electronic!  It's amazing how many years I will keep emails for :P  I think I just haven't gotten around to going through them and throwing them away...

So as I have only two days left of work till summer holidays, I've taken upon myself the task of cleaning up my work emails as well as my computer info.  I have so many old documents on here that I don't really need - especially personal ones!  Time to go through and throw away all this stuff...

Mind you I've just spent the past two hours going through and deleting old emails from work (and occasionally sending some on to my personal email address for safekeeping in their proper place, which means sometime I gotta go through the ones at home as well), and now I'm going to see if I can go through old files on here - word docs and pdfs, mostly - and get rid of most of those as well.  Phew!  

Though what's interesting with the ones that are more personal, is it's a very bizarre reminder of the psyche-states I was in at the time, not to mention physical states!  Going through old journal entries of scuba diving, for instance, was absolutely fascinating, and I've realized just how much I've changed since those days... but also it seems to me that many of those things that I was going through or whatever, they were too much or too intense for me to handle at the time, so those emails and documents and plans and experiences and everything just went on paper and were tucked away to be brought out and processed at a later date... a later date being very close to now!

So as I go through these things I'm also bringing up memories still charged with emotion or feelings of elation or rejection or just lots to think about that I simply didn't have time to think about at the time.  And now, now I'm going back through my life, the past five years of my life at least, and trying to discover just what exactly happened!  And what I have done and how that's affected me and whether those goals I gave myself about four years ago now have been accomplished and if they are still the goals I'm interested in.  And then what my new path from here is and my new goals and plans of action for those goals.

Interesting prospect for the summer months, eh?  Sitting on a blanket in the backyard sipping fresh juice with ice and musing about life...  Nothing like blue sky and sunshine to help muse about life :)"

"event","I wanna go wwoofing!  Hurrah!

Except for that I'm in debt and shouldn't abandon my job and run off to a foreign country for several months.

Damn.

Well, I'll be at least a little bit (read: a lot more than I want to be) responsible, and pay off the debt first... but then I'll go wwoofing!  With raw fooders in Costa Rica or France!  Free stay, free food, free exercise (read: hard work), free fresh air, and free language practice... what more could I ask for?

Except I don't think I can take three months off work and still come back to it.  Well, I wanted to move into something new and different anyways, and preferrably not downtown, so perhaps that is it.  Dig myself out of debt, and then move right along with a bright new life.

Speaking of which, I spent this morning looking at my entire year's worth of visa purchases, to find out what exactly I spent my money on!  There were three plane tickets on there (Chapel Hill, Thailand, and within Laos; the one to Calgary was on my previous card), which didn't help, as well as a piercing and a tattoo.  Other than that, this year I went to the spa and hairdresser for the first time in my life, and ended up spending $2,750 on various treatments ($1,200 for laser hair removal, and $350 for a tattoo, but the rest is just shocking!).  Not to mention the almost $3000 I spent on clothing, shoes, accessories, and cosmetics (including sunscreen).  Keep in mind that's over a whole year, but it's still, well I wince at the numbers, let's just say that!  I keep thinking ""that can't be right,"" but then there are the numbers staring back at me... 

What's really interesting to me actually looking at my nice sheet of paper, is the differences in numbers over the months.  For instance, in August I bought rather a lot of clothes, and September comparably little.  In October I spent a lot of money on hair and tattoo, in November I spent a lot on clothes, and December and January I spent pretty much nothing on anything.  February was a stress-related ebay shopping spree, and March was a pre-Thailand hair removal plan.  April I didn't spend a single penny on clothes or treatments, and in May I only went shopping once and spent about $75.  Which suggests to me: that in August I was in total stress and despair about my neck issue and tried to make myself feel better by buying stuff; that in October and November I was stressed again, and December and January I hid indoors while it was cold and wet out (my version of hibernation).  Then in February I was working more and stressing about Thailand and tried to make myself feel better using ebay (it didn't really work, incidentally, but it helps a bit), and April I spent mostly in Laos and totally relaxed chilling afterwards, which lasted at least halfway through May.  The rest of May was kept in check by my money issues which have made me far more attentive to where and how I spend... 

It's frustrating to deal with money issues, especially when 1) I'm about to go on an unpaid vacation to ""relax"", and 2) it requires a lot more patience than I have.  For instance, I can expect to pay off all my debts by about September or October of 2008, with a little bit of thriftiness but without penny-pinching, or I can decide to work more hours and therefore pay it off faster (I currently work part-time).  Of course that would require more effort and less stress-free easy living on my part, which is what usually leads to overspending and general irresponsibility on my part as I struggle to live within small walls.  I was never meant to live in a box...  no space for my wings!"

"event","Maybe that's a strange title for an entry, but it's an apt title, so it stands.

Yes, I'm afraid of exercise.

Says the girl who did two dance classes yesterday (both high energy) and has a yoga addiction.

But it seems to me that though once upon a time I was a bit of a gym rat and an athletic overachiever (well, attempted athletic overachiever), now I have become a bit of a weakling... and I simply don't have the motivation I once had to do something about it.

I suppose then that ""doing something about it"" has little to do with buying gear or taking up new hobbies (erk!) or teaching myself how to exercise, but instead has to do with getting the motivation to exercise back again.  So what would that motivation be?  What would pull me out of my oh-so-comfortable lying in the sun reading or just melting and eating salads and fruit on a blanket in the grass, into getting up and running or biking or swimming or dancing (more) or doing pilates or doing yoga (more) or taking a martial arts class or lifting weights or whatever?

I mean part of it is that we're getting the first real dose of sunshine for the summer right about now.  It's 25 degrees and sunny, with not a cloud in the sky and the trees are bursting with bright spring green.  I can finally sit outside with a tank top and shorts and start a base tan so I don't burn later on (otherwise known as synthesizing large amounts of vitamin D!).  And so I just, well, I really like to just sit in the sunshine!  Not drive anywhere or go indoors to work out or anything - even running in the woods is a bit iffy cause it's in the shade.  I think once the novelty of the sunshine wears off I'll be ready and willing to do something a little more than loll about in it (I hope!).

Also, I have the feeling that I only have so much motivation to go around, and I can choose what to spend it on.  Right now I'm focusing so much on dietary changes (and for sure, those changes require a great bit of motivation!) that I don't know if I have the motivation left to throw at exercise!  I know exercise and nutrition go ""hand in hand"" at least in the public eye, but I can only change one of them at a time (I think) especially if they happen to be big changes!  I also think my body is reacting to different food types and decreased caloric density of foods (i.e. more water- and fibre-rich fruit n veggies) that it's doing some adjusting to get used to the new eating plan.  Which means less energy for exercising and less motivation available for exercising - so it simply doesn't get done!  Again, I'm no couch potato, but I certainly want to be getting more exercise than I am, for two major reasons: one is cardiovascular, I simply want to be able to keep up in my dance classes.  The second is muscular, partly I simply don't like being weak, and partly I like the look of muscles, and partly I want to make sure as I change my eating habits that I don't let my body get rid of too much muscle tissue!

So a friend of mine calls me up today and asks me to go on a bike ride with him next week - already I would lag a bit even when I was in shape, but he is endlessly patient with me.  So it would be the first bike ride of the summer, hurrah!  Except I have hardly been on my bike at all this year (I got it out and pumped up the tires and went for a bit of a ride once or twice, but that's it), and I'm <i>definitely</i> not ready to pedal over a hundred kilometers!  I think I'm going to have to beg out or make it shorter, but on the other hand it can be a great push for me to work on my biking.  Distance, speed, etc... But I don't think I'd be ready for it even if I biked every day from now till then.  Which is pretty much what I'm thinking of doing!  So yes, it's fantastic motivation for me.  And I need that motivation!  But I think it may simply be too much...

OK me, time to get in shape :)  I don't know about that bike ride but I'll definitely be on my bike to work up to it when we do get around to doing it.  And I will keep at my dance classes, and work at running until I can make it for more than ten minutes without having to stop (I'm starting slow, ok?!), and find a way to build some muscle too while I'm at it.  Gotta make it a priority; the sun will be here all summer (more and more so as it goes on!), and it's time to get up off of that beach blanket and into some movement... even if that means putting food issues on the backburner!  Mind you, I learned something from my singing class the other day, where I was asked to walk around and sit and stand up WHILE singing, when I realized that distracting myself from singing was actually making my voice sound <i>better</i> than when I just stood there and focused on it!  Maybe food is the same way?  Maybe the best way of not reaching for a slice of pizza is to go swimming???"

"event","OK, now tell me truthfully: how much school is too much school?

So.  I have a BA in Psychology and English.
Next year I'm working on an undergraduate certificate in Health and Fitness.
The following year I want to do a MSc in Population and Public Health.
Two years after that I want to do a Ma in Counselling Psychology.
In the meantime I'd like to continue taking undergraduate courses in Nutrition as well as possibly get a second Bachelor's degree, though I don't know what in yet; I'm thinking French and Religious Studies right now.

Is that too much school?  That takes me pretty much till 2013, and then I may want to do a Bachelor of Fine Arts in contemporary dance, but that may just be a dream not a reality!  

I mean, as long as I can work and make some money in that time, what stops me from going to school till I'm 80 years old (and later)?  And why would I want to work and make money anyways: status and prestige?  the idea of wealth?  I mean, really, am I looking for either and why?  The only reason I want money is so that I can live, learn, and travel.  And I don't really need much money to do that!  And the only reason I want prestige... oh no wait, that can't end in a positive statement, so perhaps I'll let it slide.

But seriously, can't I do part-time work and part-time studies for the rest of my life?  Why do I have this strange idea in my head that when I get to age 30 I have to be finished schooling and settled down in what I want to do?  How can I <i>possibly</i> think that way when I'm surrounded by people who really don't do that, who spend their whole lives living and learning and changing and never finally <i>become</i> who they're meant to become and then just stay that way.  Hell, I don't even believe that's possible!  Is it ever possible to stop changing and growing, or is the stagnation of changelessness a form of death and decay?"

"event","Oh goodness, the idea of labels.  I'd be surprised if I hadn't already touched on this one... labels.  I don't like them.  They put people in boxes, and boxes have walls and floors and ceilings and are generally restrictive.

On the other hand, labels can be positive.  Not just to tell people who you are or what you do with the least amount of time and effort (for instance I can say ""I'm a vegetarian"" or ""I'm a dancer,"" and now anyone who's reading this is probably seeing a younger slim athletic female who has both drive and a laid-back/fun-loving quality).  Our brains are programmed to categorize, after all, so that's what we do.

So is my dislike of labels really a dislike of being boxed in?  And is it ok to box myself in, as in choose my ""lines which I do not cross,"" versus being boxed in by someone else?  And does it matter really when other people box me in, or do I have to believe them to make it matter?  Or does it matter who they are and how close they are to me?

One of the things I think when I think of calling myself a ""raw foodist"" is that I don't know if I'd be pretending.  As it were.  I mean, if I call myself one, then I will feel as if there is external pressure and eyes on me when (if) I eat cooked food!  Versus only internal pressure and guilt.  And yet... isn't that the point?  To a certain extent?  To use that external drive to help lend mmph to my internal drive and help me keep away from cooked foods?  

I was just reading a ""raw food"" site which was defining a ""raw fooder"" as someone who eats 75% or more of their foods in an uncooked state.  Which was shocking to me, I forgot that that was once the cutoff I gave to myself even!  Where I had said, ""if I can get to 75% of my food raw, then I will call myself a raw fooder.""  And yet here I am now, not considering myself a raw fooder because yesterday I had a cookie!

Now, mind you if it were vegetarian, I'd say yes, I don't get to eat meat on occasion and call myself a vegetarian.  Nor do I call myself a vegan, as I occasionally do have dairy products, and I'd want to make sure I don't have dairy products and I haven't for a while before I make any sort of statement of veganism.

Alas, the story ends here, as it's time to leave."

"event","So.  I've gone on my raw obsession, filled my head with new healthy-eating beliefs, and changed my habits and diet to correspond to that, enough so that it's all downhill from here.  Transitional symptoms, fatigue, and random inexplicable symptoms have passed and I've decided that whole fresh ripe raw organic fruits and vegetables are the best food for me and no supplements or herbal remedies or fantastic new superfoods can ever be as good for me as the foods that nature designed for me to eat, or I should say, that nature designed me to eat.

So you'd think that'd be it.  Done.  The change is the difficult part, the maintenance much easier.  And yet...

Well, the ""and yet"" is really quite simple, and has nothing to do with nutrition.  The ""and yet"" is the fact that I have an obsessive temperament, i.e. I really get excited about things.  So when I get all food obsessed and read all the books and search for all the articles and do all the logical thinking and then make my plans and design meals and then feel all proud for having accomplished something, I enjoy it.  I enjoy discovering and changing and working to become a better person, a healthier person, a wiser person and a happier person, not to mention nicer to other people.  

So if I'm done with my food changes, or at least I'm at the point at which it's far better to just not think about them rather than being obsessed with food all day - because regardless of whether the food is healthy or not, the obsession certainly isn't - well, then what?  I have to think about SOMETHING...

So this morning I made my breakfast lunch and dinner in one fell swoop (I'm out all day today), and then I looked around for some reading to do on the bus.  And I cast about looking and looking, quite possibly spending more time looking for something to read than I had preparing my meals, and finally just grabbed a little book on nutrition so I could head out the door.  And then I got to work and I wanted to write, and all I had to write about was food.  Except I had nothing new to write on it; anything I wrote seemed to be going backwards!  And I realized with shock, that I was coming out of a food obsession and had nothing in particular I was going into!  

Of course it's always lovely to get over an obsession and take a step back and reevaluate life.  It's pretty much like breaking up with someone - suddenly you have all this free time as something that has probably been becoming a negative influence overall (hence the breakup) has ended, and now you have all this energy to turn to all the positive things in your life, if only you could remember what they were!  Wait, what did I like doing again?

And it's in this brief surfacing in between obsessions when you both have the ability to direct your life for the next round of interests, and you have the opportunity to find another way to live without obsessing.  Well, theoretically!  I get the sneaking suspicion that if I could give up obsessing about things and just enjoy them instead, I would be a happier person overall.  But I also know that right now, I enjoy doing things.  Doing things and learning things and getting better at things and becoming a different person because of that.  Maybe I could find some balance in my life by, well, balancing my life - relaxing, spending more time with friends, and just wandering around and doing things that I enjoy.  But wouldn't I be more successful if I, say, trained for a triathlon?  And yet last time I tried <i>that</i> I ended up with a knee injury from overuse (did I mention I get obsessive?).  And is that really success, or is that just adding to my collection of stories that makes up my life?  And does that collection of stories tie me down or free me up?  

And what if I decide to not be obsessed with anything but instead to try this whole ""balanced and relaxed"" thing, am I likely to have a balanced and relaxed life really or will I just fall back into one of my old obsessions?  Some of these would be OK but I certainly don't want to fall back into food obsession, not if I want to make this change permanent.  Overthinking it once it's a habit makes me more likely to degenerate than to maintain my healthy habits!  

Perhaps I will try balance for a while, with a slight obsession towards meditation and yoga.  That way I'm obsessed with the search for obsessionlessness.  I wonder if that will work?"

"event","And again... but this time there's something set in stone.  i.e., I just paid my deposit for Dr. Doug Graham's fasting retreat this coming January!  Yes that's 8 months away from now, but to me, that's a serious thing.  A committment.  Something outside of my choice at this point - decision made already, even though it's in the future (and somewhat far in the future!).  Only thing to do now is prepare for it...

That's true of so many things in my life, isn't it?  Isn't that a common practice of mine, to sign up for something I don't feel at all prepared for, and then the drive to prepare for it mixes with the initial drive to excel at it and becomes a force that is enough to move me forwards (sometimes at a tremendous pace)?  

But there we are.  I'm going to do a six-week retreat, involving three weeks of fasting and three weeks of ""refeeding"" the proper way.  All in the presence of my favourite nutritionist, several helpful naturopathic interns, and a limited group (12 total) of fasters, in the wonderful wilderness of Costa Rica.  And they organize everything for me, so that all I need to do is show up at the airport in San Jose, and everything else is sorted, down to transportation, sightseeing, accomodation, and meals (or not meals, as the case may be!).  And, I don't have to explain my eating habits to anyone, not fellow travellers nor locals, nor do I have to feel guilty about eating the way I'd like to nor do I even have the opportunity to eat the way I wouldn't like to!  Finally, peer pressure working FOR me!

I'm still very nervous about it - for the umpteenth time I will say, as Ali says, I'm afraid of my BEGINNINGS not my ENDINGS!  And I get the feeling that this will be life-changing - in fact, I'm sure it will be, and if it isn't I will be disappointed indeed!  But things that are life-changing cause life-stress.  All change produces some stress I believe as we move away from a state of homeostasis into the state of change and fluctuation before we settle on a new homeostasis.  Change is uncomfortable and unfamiliar and we tend to like to fall back upon what we know and are used to and habituated to.  Habits are hard to end and hard to create... but then again, they are very easy to maintain!  Such is the function of a habit.  The change is difficult, the maintenance easy...

Again I go back in my mind to when I became a vegetarian and how much effort and thought and reading and planning and learning it took for me to move myself towards the decision to go vegetarian... and then the decision was momentary.  The straw that breaks the camel's back, or more pleasantly put, reaching the top of a mountain pass... And yet after the decision was made there was also a lot of effort and thought and reading and planning and learning involved in making and maintaining that change.  The habit of eating meat had to be broken and the habit of not eating meat had to be created.  But now, something like five years later, it's a total no-brainer for me!  I haven't had a meat craving since that first year (with the possible exception of wanting turkey at Thanksgiving/Christmas, which lasted about three years and had more to do with comfort and family and holidays than it did with actual food), and I have no desire to eat meat now; in fact I don't really think of it as food, and often forget that other people eat it, which makes restaurant menus a bit shocking to me :)  Seriously!

And even cheese and eggs, I don't see those as food so much - even though I still eat a bit of both!  It seems to me like plastic or something bizarre, not food - it doesn't even really look like food, just slab squares of white bendy stuff, or rubbery white-yellow circles!  And yet I still have such attraction to the taste or feel in my mouth or the opioids that are present in dairy products or simply the excess salt that they/I add, that I still eat them on occasion!  Yeuck!

But maybe it still feels like a radical change to me, to eat only raw fruits and veggies, with a few nuts and seeds thrown in?  It certainly seems less radical to me now than it did at first (when I insisted that grains MUST be an important staple in an overall diet), and certainly less radical than it would have if I had heard of it before I went veggie... but now it sort of seems normal, and everything else seems weird and un-food-like.  

But though it seems normal on an intellectual level, and though everything else seems weird and un-food-like, my body still wants something heavy at least once a day!  I can only assume this means I'm undereating on fruit, which is likely the case anyways, but it gets frustrating because it becomes a ""battle of wills"" once a day between 10am-4pm.  Breakfast is fine with juices and some fruit, dinner at home is easy as I try and eat lightly, but lunchtime... I put off that feeling with a big salad with fruit and some avocado, but then about an hour or two later I get that feeling again, that ""empty stomach"" hunger, and that feeling that I want to shovel heavy food into my stomach (such as lentil curry on rice) just to fill in the pit that I feel!  Nothing to do with energy, just a discomforting ""hunger"" of emptiness...

Alas I could talk about this all day, but it's time to go to a yoga class - perhaps it will be distracting, I can only hope!  Though I have to say that ""fresh frozen"" green soybeans have just succeeded in filling that pit without being too exhausting to eat (I had some vegan pizza this morning - like two little slices - and had to lie down for 20 minutes after and was tired for a while after that, quick response!), and without falling into my category of ""non-foods""... note for next time, good trick :)

And now, to wander off physically rather than just mentally."

"event","Another trip down food restriction lane.  

Only this time I'm being far more kind to myself and allowing slip-ups and transitions and all that to happen, over time, without feeling guilty and beating myself up about it or feeling hopeless and giving up on it.  Two paths that have never led anywhere productive.

I think it started when I went to a weekend by my sufi teacher, the first one I went to this year.  Something in either his teachings or my interactions with people or my particular interaction with one dear Sheikh gave me a huge boost of energy and an intense desire to get out of the rut I have been falling into over the last few months especially, but over the last year to be honest.  

The solution?  Eat better.  

You are what you eat, and all that, right?  So I decided that the chocolate and cheese and cream and wheat and sugar and lentil curry on rice and MSG-laden noodles and salt and all that other junk that I had been putting in my body simply had to go.  

First thing I did, was suddenly decide to spend one day eating only grapes (and water), from the minute I woke up to the minute I went to sleep.  This went surprisingly well and I was feeling very proud of myself, if suffering a rather severe caffeine headache, and generally being very tired throughout the day.  I had meetings at work from 10am-2pm, which I suppose was a good thing as it took my mind off eating, plus a lot of it was sitting and listening, which was easier at that point than trying to analyze RCT methodology *crossed-eyes*.  Course it had to be that day that my boss found out she had been awarded the CRC, and we all went out for drinks on-the-house, and may I just point out here that a martini and a glass of champagne are really not what you want to put in a stomach that has been empty all day.  Fortunately I seem to have had some control over myself (despite not walking quite straight), and nobody seemed to notice how drunk I really was...

From then on it's been totally vegan, with a little something heavier for breakfast (my favourites now are a bean and veggie burrito (vegan, organic), and tortilla soup (also vegan, organic)), and then the rest of the day have fresh fruits and veggies only, with minimal fat and as much greenery as I can stand to eat.  Except for Sunday, when all I had was Maple Lemonade (a version of the Master Cleanse for those of us who can't handle the heat of cayenne!), which was a lot of water and very little anything else.  

Suffice to say I'm a little wonky today, though less so than I expected... Somehow I've muddled through this past week of bizarre eating patterns without anyone noticing very much, and without sitting around doing nothing; in fact, I whirled at and helped run a workshop at a conference this weekend, as well as doing an audition for a dance team which was hilarious and fun, and they say for sure I'll get in.  Which was surprising as there was 45 minutes to learn a choreography and dance it for the judges, and I showed up a good 25 minutes late!  ~oops~!

Anyways on the plus side I think I've finally gotten rid of that ugly bloating around my midsection that no one but me seems to see, but that doesn't stop me wanting to eat vegan, and as raw as possible (I won't be picky this time round - take two!).  The question becomes, how do I do it and eat enough to thrive on (rather than just survive), and how do I still fit into normal society?  The first question is a funny one, cause I just spent the last few months trying to not eat quite so much cause I was gaining more weight and feeling more lethargic than I like.  And now suddenly I need to eat more, a whole lot more, except of none of the things I was eating before.  Fresh raw local organic apples yes, lentil curry no.  Hmmm...  The second is an anxiety-producing one.  It's easy enough to feed a vegetarian in this city, we're very veggie friendly, you can even get a veggie meal (usually some sorta pasta) at a steak house.  Vegan is a little more challenging, though not unmanageable.  Raw vegan is outta the question.  Well maybe a fruit/salad bar.  Since I'm not too picky I could probably get by at any restaurant that has salad, I can certainly order it without meat or dairy.  And I wouldn't get tired of it, but would the people I eat with get tired of it?  And, am I crazy for worrying about it?  

I guess it's the usual problem, though, that I want to be seen as (a) not too much of a hassle, and (b) not too much of a weirdo.  The second one is laughable at this point, I don't know many people who think I'm normal.  But I have to be willing to be weird and not mind people seeing me that way.  I guess I could come out of the vegan closet, as it were, and as I'm not really a complete raw foodist and I'm willing to compromise on it, I'll just not mention the rest.  Mind you it's been, what, six days now that I haven't eaten dairy products or eggs?  (OMG it's already been six days since I started this, how weird!).  So I guess maybe I'll hold off on that pronouncement until I'm sure.  I would say wait a month, but by then I'll be in Thailand, and I have no idea what the food will be like or what I'll eat!  So I will wait till a couple of weeks after I get back from Thailand, when I've re-landed here and got myself on some sort of established pattern.

And now the deep psychological underpinnings of me.  Why is it that I want to be seen as ""not that weird""?  And is it even true?  Wouldn't it be better in a way to make myself weird in a very concrete and certain way, so that people get some sort of a handle on me, psychologically, and can type me as they will, which is far less threatening to them than to have someone who is in constant flux and/or is quiet about everything they do?  I mean, seriously now, I spent a good chunk of my life studying psychology, formally and informally; people are fascinating creatures!  But it's true that people are far more threatened by the unknown than they are by the known, regardless of how weird the known may be.  In a way, wouldn't it be easier all around if I could construct a good solid facade for people to see and understand, even if it is weird?

And now the practical issues to face: hunger and energy level.  Oh, and comfort, of course!  Like right now I had a large and delicious salad with half an avocado and two fresh oranges chopped on top (no other dressing than that!).  And I was happy and satisfied for an hour or so, now I'm hungry and want my lentil curry.  Well no I don't, really, I just want the IDEA of lentil curry, probably because I can't have it.  Which is weird, on so many levels.  I get so worked up about preparing for things, I think is the problem, and this evening I plan to do a number of dance classes which will be awesome and fun and four hours long.  And so I'm sitting here thinking, maybe I should stock up on food fuel before going, so that I can last through those four hours?  And I've already had my smoothie and my salad, now all I have left is a half a green drink, three apples, and a banana.  Which is probably enough food energy to get me through four hours of dance classes, come to think of it, and yet I'm still sitting here wanting lentil curry.  Except only sort of.  A cookie would do too, I think...  I wonder what this actually is, is it some sort of attempt at self-sabotage, or a part of me that rebels against all rules, or a need for comfort and security found through food, or simply a passing craving?  Is it a valid reason to go eat lentil curry (which isn't that bad, incidentally, it's just the rice and bread that go with it that pretty much knock me out for a few hours after eating it), or is it a good sign that I should NOT eat it and gain the feeling of self-control from that?  And is it self-control really, or self-denial, and where is that line drawn?  And, always in eyesight, how do I make sure that this is (a) physically healthy, i.e., enough food energy and nutrients to thrive on and do everything I want to do, rather than disordered eating patterns, and (b) mentally/emotionally healthy, not using food for comfort nor the deprival of food as some sort of matter of pride or self-punishment or leading to a life-obscuring obsession?

This is what you get when a psychologist tackles anything in this world... way too much overthinking of the simplest of things!  I would go on and on and on here, picking apart my brain until there was nothing left to look at, but I would drive everyone (including myself) crazy!  So here I'll stop, and I will certainly be surprised if anyone made it this far :)"

"event","Well ok so it happened a little like this.

I was looking around for different interesting things to get involved with during my winter break wonderings, you know, the kind of wonderings that happen when it's cold and icky out and you're indoors online and wandering through cyberspace with a good cup of tea and an active imagination.  Not to mention the whole bit about January 1st coming up, and a whole new year with new horizons upon you.  And you're sitting there wondering what you did in the past year and what you can do in the new year to make you a better person, or get closer to your goals, or follow the next step in an endlessly winding path leading who-knows-where.  Which is usually how I manage to go through life, and why my life has been so seemingly random, though when looked back upon each step seemed reasonable at the time (but how do you explain to someone the totally normal and reasonable way you took up underwater hockey?).  Martin Luther King Jr. had something to say about that, you don't need to see the whole staircase, you just need to take the first step.  Course it would be nice to know where the staircase <i>led</i>...

Anyways I digress and lost the thread of that last paragraph, so I'll start a new one and see if I can stay on some sort of topic.  

Right, well anyways, in these wanderings I did a bit of asking questions, and sometimes I would even get back answers.  One answer was from a singing teacher who is now turning me into an opera singer (soprano, no less!  and me with my low voice), and the other is from an acting studio.  Which I audited a class from and loved it, and loved the instructor/facilitator.  And apparently he liked me and sees potential and wants me to come back.  Maybe has something to do with a poem I wrote on the way home from class and sent to him, which he was quite thrilled with, and printed it out and posted it for everybody to see (notwithstanding the mistake I made in the last few lines, though I had to read it about 10 times before I realized I had accidentally reversed two important words; I think it's one of those cases where the mind knows what is meant so it automatically reads it the right way even though it's written wrong).  And I would love love LOVE to spend more time in his class, I've never met anyone more open, honest, and naked than he is.  So much so that I felt like I should look the other way to cover what he was unwilling to cover.  ""As human beings we want to be understood, but in order to be understood we have to live openly.""  And I love it and I want to be able to dig that deeply in myself and live that openly to everyone else and be that honest with myself and the people I care about and the world in general.  And I get the feeling he can help with that, and that he can help me find strength even while showing weakness (i.e. emotionality, which is perhaps inherently vulnerable).  And find that core of self that is under even emotion, that if I was only willing to express and feel and live emotion I could realize that that too, like my mind, isn't who I really am but is just a layer on top of who I am that is there in order to interface with the world around me... whereas now I think that emotion IS the raw me underneath it all, simply because I hide it so deeply within myself.  

OK, this is obviously a ramble-y day, but I seem to be getting to the bottom of something important.

The problem being, to get back to the boring and intellectual level, is that I don't really have time for it right now.  My schedule's kinda insanely full already, and I'm also going to Thailand and Laos for three weeks in March, and in the meantime have extra work to get done at work first so that I can take the vacation time (as well as not feeling guilty about leaving my coworkers short-staffed).  So I'm working with the program coordinator to figure out when I can start the program and how this will all fit together.  I promised her that I have her booked already into Tuesday evenings come September (she laughed but appreciatively) so in the meantime it's simply a matter of how much schedule-shuffling I can do before I go insane or drop other responsibilities.  And how quickly I can start this acting workshop without distressing the other students involved (i.e. I'm really going to be there-and-not-there for a while, making homework and scene work with partners rather difficult!).

Oh I did like that emotional and under-emotional level of thinking better, it was so much more interesting!  Alas, alack...  I think I've lost that *mmph* that got me there so I'm stuck on this intellectual plane once more.

Though it's funny I did originally get into this acting thing simply to help find a way for me to learn to dance in front of someone.  Like, anyone!  I'm terrified when it comes to people watching me...  So I thought maybe I would tackle that head-on, as trying to simply improve at dancing has not helped my self-consciousness about it as much as I would have liked it to.  This also led, of course, from kinda randomly being asked to help host a talk-show by a producer who's a sufi and a sort of friend of the family...  My teacher (my teacher's English voice, at least) said he thought it was a good idea, and so I threw myself into it without hesitation (I wish I could say that with total honesty).  And then thought about acting lessons, and now my producer wants me to act in a movie he is making...  oh there are so many complications with that one though that I'm not even going to talk about it or expect anything from it!

Alhamdullillah for all these opportunities.  God really is great!  ~lol~  May everyone be as blessed as I have been, or even more so, if they can stand it :)"

"event","Interesting things are afoot, and interesting changes are at hand.

Here's where I get to be annoyingly vague :)  Something that had been building for a while and taking up increasing amounts of my thought and energy reached a peak last night and is now coasting downhill, as I understand a little more where I fit, and I can take the intensity away from it.  In the process I'm seeing my life a little more from my own standpoint and not from someone else's, and the things I do I can do for myself without having to consider what someone else would think - at least not as much as I was beginning to.  Yea, so I'm passionate and obsessive sometimes, it's what gets me into trouble as well as beautiful places.  'S all good.

Anyways in the process two things have happened: 1) I'm proud of myself for making some sort of move and more clearly expressing what I want, regardless of whether I get it or not, cause I'm really bad at that.  2) I suddenly have all this extra released energy that had been going into thinking too much, chiding myself for my inhibitions, and steeling myself to try and make some sort of move or sign or show what I feel.

Vagueness over.  Now on to the ""where to go from here"" portion of the show, which is much more fascinating to me.  

For instance, for the last few days I have been not hungry.  Not for junk food, not for good food, not really for anything, and not even enjoying a good cup of tea like I used to (mind you that may be because I had an exposed nerve where part of my tooth fell out and I couldn't drink anything hot or cold for the last five days).  It's very bizarre but I think I'll take this chance to do something about my dismal eating patterns, leading to fatigue, disgust at myself, and rather more fat around my middle than I like.  ~lol~  I did not say I WAS fat, btw, in case anyone who knows me is reading this and is snickering right now...  But it's true, and now I'm back in pursuit of that 6-pack :D  Nothing like a little goal to motivate and move me... Also I sort of randomly signed up to do a contemporary jazz show at my school (yes I know I don't go to school, but that's irrelevant), with very little training and only a little over a month before the show (~gaack!~).  And yet honestly I'm far more excited than I am nervous.  Give me time, I'll get all worked up about it :P  

I don't think I have much else to say, or by that I mean I have not much else that I need to write out of my head.  So that's all for now, folks."

"event","Oh my goodness gracious me, I'm confused and unsure.

How's that for an introduction?  ~lol~  Oh well it's true though.  I have a very basic idea of what I want, in a vague sense, and it vaguely seems to be coming about the way I want it to, but there's nothing concrete going on.  No plans are cemented, instead lots of things are floating in the air.  Good ideas, you know, but definitely vague.  And it's hard to tell anyone what I'm doing if I don't know - I can only guess or say what I want to do.  And every day (or few days anyways) the ""Plan A"" changes.  Alas...

What I DO know for sure is it's time for a change.  I just haven't figured out how MUCH of a change I'm looking for.  Do I need to get outta this city, or will that be more distressing than relaxing?  Do I need a job or am I willing to take out a loan and go into debt to pursue university studies?  Or perhaps I will kick around the city, taking a year to dance and do the things I love to do, with a side job to make enough to get by on?  Or perhaps I will find a more intense job where I can save up to go back to school so I won't have to worry about going into debt?  Maybe I will work on a degree or certificate program here?  A few things call out to me like this certificate in health and fitness taught here, or doing a yoga teacher training program, or just a personal trainer program?  Things such as this which are short-term and have the possibility of preparing me for something - though who knows what.  Or maybe I need something totally different, like going off to teach English in some remote corner of the world?

I'm leaning towards spending the next year here, with an hourly very-part-time-job somewhere, while doing that certificate on the side and trying to save up some money to do a more serious degree the following year.  And of course pursuing my interests like dancing and other physical pursuits.  I wonder how feasible that is?

What I DO know is that by the time I leave here I will have paid off my credit card (it's amazing how much I used to spend, and how much easier it is NOT to spend when there's an end-point to my income!), and have a bit of money tucked away to get me through the summer and then a bit, but not much more than that.  Which means come September I need another job or a loan.  

And no, I'm not keeping the job I have now past June, of THAT I'm sure - in my mind the end of June is a very, very concrete date for me...  Though of course if I think it through logically, it doesn't make any sense.  I work part-time and make a decent income, what's wrong with that?  And yet to me there seems to be something wrong... of course logically the best thing to do would be to keep my job until I knew exactly where I was going instead - either to a degree (which would be hard to maintain a job during), or to another similar job with good pay, or something of the sort.  Cause if I'm going to be kicking around the city for at least another year then I could definitely use the income...  *gaack* though, it's this same feeling that has me staying in this job despite the issues and frustrations and the sheer number of years I've worked here (quite enough years, thank you - four-and-a-half now, and I'm not actually all that old!!!).  And I know that part of it is I NEED to move on to something else, somehow I need to, even if it was the same type of work somewhere else somehow that would be better, just for a change.  It's the stagnation that gets to me, I think... and it's annoying cause I love working here and my coworkers and my head supervisor and everyone is so friendly and accomodating, at least to a certain point...  Yet I HAVE to move on, or I'll go insane.  It's a bit frustrating to know that, as I know that I would have to go out and find another job, and it may be the same kind of job or worse, with less pay and fewer benefits... *argh*...

OK see where the frustration and distress comes in, because I know I have to stop what I'm doing now, but I don't know what I should start to do instead.  And those loose ends are hard to deal with :S"

"event","I've come across a new strange phenomenon in my psyche.  It seems that I'm so used to being tired, that I believe I'm tired even when I'm not.  I think it comes from being tired non-stop for a year or so.  I developed all sorts of ways to deal with it: caffeine, sugar, napping whenever I had a chance, and jumping on the chance to stay home and sleep in or even get to bed early.  

But then came winter holidays, and I slept.  I slept a lot.  I stayed indoors and slept and lay around in bed in those not-quite-ready-to-get-up-yet moods.  I even watched TV and played video games with my brother (back from university for the holidays).  And ate and read and did crossword puzzles, and then went back to sleep.  I slept so much that I finally even got rid of the seemingly-permanent dark circles under my eyes!

And now it's January, and I'm back at work, and hard at play.  That is, what I do for fun takes up rather a lot of time and energy and effort, more so than working does.  And yes my schedule looks a little insane to the point of nervous-breakdown-time, but I have a lot more free time than it appears at first glance; yesterday, for instance, I slept in till noon, played computer games till 4:30, drove to a 1.5 hr dance class, drove home, and then went back to eating and sitting around doing nothing for an hour and then went to bed early.  I was awake for all of nine hours yesterday...  And yet this morning I'm all like, I hope I have time for a nap before I have to do a million things this evening.  I've been reminding myself all day long that I actually had a really good night's sleep last night and am quite awake and alert and functional, and really don't need to catch any sleep before anything.  Same goes with time off: I still am trying to make extra space in my schedule for down-time, and yet there IS space for it, I HAVE been taking lots and lots of down-time to the point it's getting boring, and I ENJOY doing the things that take me outside of the home.  Even if it's work :P

So I dunno how best to deal with myself, I sound irrational and like I'm finding excuses to be lazy.  Now I don't REALLY want to be lazy, overall; I enjoy doing lots of different things, key word being ""enjoy"".  The only time I get a little overwhelmed is when I end up running from one thing to another too quickly, or try and do more things than I have energy for.  And it's odd cause I'm the one who decided to do the things I'm doing, there's no sense in saying I've been pressured into it, it really is my choice... so why is it I feel obligated to go and do things when I'm not, and then complain about how busy I am?  I mean, the least I should do is NOT COMPLAIN!!!  ~lol~

Part of it I think is also the dark winter months.  Something about dark cold wet winter months just makes me want to stay indoors with a cup of tea and a good book/TV show/video game.  (Alas, if it were only a good book, at least I would feel as if I accomplished something!)  And that's all well and good, because in the summertime I usually feel like going out and doing more things, so it balances out.  Especially so as I plan to be taking a few months of summer off work (unpaid vacation, woo hoo!), so I'll have the extra time to, well, sleep in and do things and still relax.  

In the meantime, I'm not that busy yet, but I'm getting there - January starts a bit slow, different activities start up at different times, and some organizing had to be done first anyways.  I think I'm more excited than anything else, there are some new things in the spring line-up, as it were, and it's always exciting to be doing new things.  As well as trying to maintain or continue to grow in the things I was doing before.  Inshallah (god willing).

And yes, one of the ""new years resolutions"" as it were (January resolutions, at least, as I can't resolve for a whole year even if I wanted to), is to get more sleep.  So far so good..."

"event","I spent a good long time with a friend of mine last night watching dance videos and discussing the old, middle-aged, and new forms of dance, while attempting to critique a dance style that has no form.  How can you critique a freestyle anyways, aren't you critiquing the PERSON not the DANCE?  Oh well, nevermind.  Suffice to say, these days dancing is like an expression of your own life - like you take everything you've ever learned and experienced and channel it into movement.  Which sort of opens up the world to whatever you want to do - there's no requirement to excel in any particular dance form, or need to stick to one thing long enough to learn it thoroughly.  Not that either of these are bad, it's just that now it's not actually NECESSARY, if that makes any sense.  I.e., anything goes, as long as you're feeling the music and other people are feeling you.  

This is a very cool concept to me, cause I have a terrible habit of getting deeply enmeshed in something (usually sufficiently bizarre: scuba diving, freediving, underwater hockey, whirling, traditional persian music, breaking, rock climbing, oh I can't even think what else) and have this huge motivational push to get better at it, and then it slowly fades away and I move on to the next thing.  Incidentally, I've always thought of this as a terrible personality trait and have fought to stay motivated in a number of areas, with varying degrees of success.  But now, NOW it seems that I can learn something with all the passion that I want and then move on without feeling guilty for leaving it behind.  Is that awesome or what?!  It's like suddenly it's OK to be unable to finish things!!!

~lol~ ok perhaps I shouldn't go quite that far.  But it IS reassuring and it reminds me as well that all aspects of life show up in all other aspects of life, as it were.  The trance of whirling shows up in my dancing.  My dancing shows up in my climbing.  My climbing even seems to show up in the way I walk.  And everything somehow shows up in my character/personality.  

And what about the new things?  The acting, the new forms of dance, the opera singing?  (Did I mention opera singing?  I'm still working on finding a good teacher...)  How will that impact my entire being, and how will it show up in the other aspects of my life?  Most importantly is to remember: everything I do is improving everything I do.

"event","OMG, what am I doing?!  Reinventing myself again.  

I'm looking into acting schools!!!

OK, two things.  One, I mean something like a part-time class that would do basics for beginners, though I think I'd like to do it through an actual school, not a community centre; which leads to Two, I have a bad history with drama... terrified of it.  Forget stage fright, when I was in grade 8/9 (the last time anyone tried to get me to act) I was scared of talking, period.  Like, anywhere.  Oy.  Fortunately my drama teacher was very very kind and forgiving.  I actually don't know how I passed that class, or did I manage to trade it for art, I'm not sure?  Long time ago.  I just know that that class was THE scariest thing in the world for me...

Yea, so I'm scared of stages, presentations, being in front of people, videocameras, and microphones.  Great start, eh?!

Well, we'll see how it goes.  Somehow I've ended up agreeing to be the guest-speaker on a television show this weekend, something to do with alternatives to crystal meth and other drugs for young people, the host guy (a friend, sort of) wants me to talk about whirling.  Yea, really have no idea how that will go.  But I will be in the studio Sunday afternoon anyways, hair/make-up, three cameras, two changes of clothes (just in case), etc. etc. etc...

I blame this all on David Tennant, you know.  I'm just so totally impressed with the expressiveness (and insanity) in his acting, I've even taken to attempting to mimic his facial expressions, except I'm not entirely sure I have the muscles to do it :S  ~lol~.  I want a little more of that hyperactive overexpressiveness in my life, is all!  And if it takes acting lessons to let that part of me out, then so be it.

Oh yes, and I'm applying to do a Masters degree in English somewhere in the British Isles or whatever you call the whole group of islands... I'd really like to do it in Dublin, that would be totally sweet.  And, one year programs!!!  Hooray for Europe!"

"event","Even just a little bit forwards would work, honestly, but it'd be nice to look REALLY forwards - like, ten years.  Fifteen years.  Twenty years.

A good friend pointed out that in ten to fifteen years I will be ""at my prime"".  As opposed to how I usually look at things, which is that THIS is the prime of my life RIGHT NOW and the older I get the more I fall apart and get wrinkly and less healthy etc.  I suppose I have a while yet before I fall apart physically... assuming I take care o myself, of course.  

So yea, ten years... I have honestly not even looked as far ahead as next spring.  I don't know what I want!  I don't know if I ever did but I did at least have dreams of what I wanted, once... 

What do I want to be able to do in ten years?
1. definitely to learn at least one other language - fluently
2. some sort of Masters or PhD
3. have a job I enjoy (I'm lucky to have this now, but it's not a permanent check-mark!)
4. be in good health
5. travel/have travelled

"event","So I don't know how this happened, it's a little strange.  But more and more even as I'm able to dance ""hip hop"" now (yes I mean the original, locking and popping, but also a variety of other similar styles), I want to branch into something else.  Something maybe more graceful and yet powerful... something with a huge emotional feeling to it... and so where do I end up?  Trying to figure out how to get myself into postmodern/contemporary dancing.  Which to a great extent means that I have to go back to the roots, trace the original evolution of the dance in order to understand it myself.  I.E., I'm going to take up ballet.

Isn't that weird, to think I started with breaking and ended up here!  But I'd better take this slow... and not lose the hip hop side of things.  Too many times I've gone to explore a new area and lost what I had learned in an old one... and it's SO hard to go back, having to re-learn everything!  I'm definitely finding that now with some of the dancing I'm doing, and I don't want it to happen to this strange and amorphosly-defined thing called ""hip hop""!"

"event","Yea so this is interesting.  I've been taking more yoga since my leg has been acting up again - old injury - to try and stretch and strengthen it so I don't hurt myself again.  And it's a lot more fun than I remember it being before!  When I used to do it (we're talking a few months ago, but never regularly) as soon as I started releasing the tension in my body I would, like, fall asleep.  Or really really want to fall asleep, rather than doing yoga.  So it was always a chore to get myself to do the exercises and poses when all I really wanted to do was sleep!  Course if I were really into yoga, I would say if that's what my body needed, then that's what I should do, just lie down and take a nap :)

Anyways, the past few weeks I have NOT felt like that, which I can only assume is because I've been getting enough sleep!  Of course it never actually FEELS like enough, but it's a lot more than I used to get, and I'm a lot less stressed out than I used to be.  Which is very cool.  And allows yoga to work in a different way than just stress-relief... it actually does something more to me.  Like, trance-state much.  I mean the kinda trance state where you open your eyes after a few breaths in a pose and you don't know where you are.  The room looks unreal, the air is swirling somehow, voices seem so very long and drawn out (this could be naturally how the teachers speak in class, however).  Somehow each breath/minute/moment seems like so long, and yet the whole class is over quickly (much more quickly than when I was struggling not to fall asleep!).  

So yea - visual auditory and temporal distortions much?  Is this normal for yoga?  I guess it's normal for a spiritual practice, or at least, to me it seems that way.  Maybe other people are more normal in their practices, like reach inner peace or whatever... sometimes I find inner peace but there's something else there for sure!  Which is very odd, but also very cool, but also... making me want drugs.  ~lol~ or maybe I shouldn't laugh?  I mean that's not cool, but on the other hand, it means I'm reaching the same states I used to get in using drugs through healthy means?  I mean, a drug can't really *produce* a state, it can only trigger your body to go into a state it was already capable of - simply changing the levels of neurotransmitters already present in the brain.  So is it so surprising that it's possible to get to those states through a practice?  Or maybe it's that my body is detoxing itself of the drugs I used to use.  Perhaps the yoga practice opens up energy flows and allows the cells to breathe and rid themselves of the waste of years of abuse (any kind of abuse, not simply pharmacological), and in the process release toxins that mimic previous drug-induced states?  God knows I've done enough acid in my life I could be detoxing from it for years... 

Interesting.  Well fortunately for me I have no idea where to get drugs these days, which keeps me outta trouble (or possibly just in different trouble).  And I DO know where to get yoga so I guess I will be doing that instead.  Probably better overall.  Though I think I have an addiction going on... I really want to spend all or most of my time at the studio, and keep wanting to take class there, even after I just finished class there... it's quite the atmosphere and experience!!!"

"event","There is, incidentally, four more days of fasting in this Ramadan; on Sunday it will be OK to eat during the day again.  Weird!  

Not that I've done particularly well this Ramadan; the first week-and-a-half was awesome, then I came home from vacation and allowed myself to drink water to try and maintain some normalacy, but it quickly became tea as well, and then all liquids.  Alas.  A few days I broke fast a bit early, and I was sick for a bit so had a day of not fasting then too.  But actually come to think of it, overall that's pretty good for a first try, a whole month, and attempting to maintain activity levels!

Anyways, on Sunday I'll be able to eat during the day, and it will be weird!  ~lol~  I want to do it right though (whatever ""right"" means really); there has been so much self-discipline built up in this month that I didn't recognize because of the whole not-being-perfect thing, and I don't want to go back to the willy-nilly eating habits that I had developed when my work moved downtown.  I want more fresh fruits and simple meals, good thick veggie stew, root veggies for the winter months, and greenery to keep my body healthy... and lots and lots and lots of liquids.  Is that too much to ask?!  Anyways I will try and plan out a decent food plan for Sunday onwards, and make sure my fridge is well-stocked with fruit.

I went to the gym today to a yoga class and then a few little extras for me, and forgot how much I like the gym; I was a happy gym rat once!!!  ~lol~  Maybe that's where I should look for a little family, as that's where I'm happy?  I could do that at the gym at my old school cause people were my age and the guys were approachable :D  But at this gym it's a little more individual I think, less community, cause people come from all different backgrounds and are therefore less likely to have things in common.  But I really enjoy going and I will go more often... and in the new year (or whenever I take my braids out) I will go swimming there and work on my freediving, which I miss dearly.  Maybe I'll get to do my triathlon next summer; I had to put it off this year because of my knee/leg injury...

And... it's ok to want to be healthy!!!  ~lol~  funny that I feel I have to say that.  But I was having dinner yesterday and was accused of being healthy because I'm a veggie, and I felt I should defend myself.  WTF, that makes no sense eh?  I used to be happy to be healthy and work really hard to be as healthy as I could get and help my body reach its potential.  What's wrong with that???"

"event","Perhaps self-understanding is too broad, general, and overarching a statement - what I really meant was I got to know myself a little better.  And got to know him a little better.  And got to know our interactions a little better.

It was very interesting, you know, partly to see just what he thinks of me and just what I think of him and just how I react to him in conversation.  For instance, as the meal went on I found myself talking more about the crazier things, perhaps as a need for a little more recognition of me as a person.  Sometimes it feels to me that I'm not really taken as a whole person, and the things I have done or am doing are kinda put aside.  I mean I do that myself, but then I respect myself as a whole person having done all the things I've done.  Whereas to some extent I wonder how much of my story ended up in his brain by  the end of the meal.  Having said that, he was tired and sounded somewhat sick... and of course is forgiven, I'm not one to hold a grudge.

I do find it interesting that, well I notice that if I mention that I'm doing something or with friends or whatever, he turns off as if he expects me to be a total loner and is disappointed when he hears otherwise (or he just refuses to hear otherwise?).  Whereas during dinner he spent a good deal of time complaining about how people always want to hang out with him and he really needs his own time.  I can understand the latter, I have the same problem myself, doing too many things and people inviting me many places... but somehow it's not ok for me to be like that, or that's what it feels like he's saying.  As if he's trying to impress me with how popular and wanted he is, but doesn't want me to be so.  Is that fair?  I'm not sure.  Reminds me of that middle-aged guy who tried to pick me up by insulting my intelligence... ok actually he said I must be really smart, but he was still smarter than me.  Ummmmmm.....

What else was there, I'm trying to think.  Oh yes, luke-warm meets fiery.  Sometimes lukewarm personalities drive me nuts.  Ok, a lot of times luke-warm personalities drive me nuts.  You can't just sort of exist, ya know, where's the fun in that?  You gotta have something you LOVE and are PASSIONATE about!  A motivation that drives you forwards!  Not like, ""well I do this cause I seem to be good at it, so *shrugs*,"" or ""yeah I guess I'm happy.""  That's what I think drove me crazy with my ex, he wouldn't have anything he was passionate about, and I tend to have a lot of things I'm passionate about and personally think passion and love for things is the only thing really worth living for.  OK perhaps I exaggerate, or perhaps I just have a very expansive view of the word passion.  But for me... I need FIRE!"

"event","Actually ok, the money issues mostly stemmed from the amount of travelling I did this summer (two separate trips).  But I still have some issues left over from that, the kind where my credit card isn't paid off.  Perhaps to some people that doesn't seem like a big deal but it is to me!  I like having a clean slate of sorts, by being out-of-debt.  Where the money that comes in is MINE, not just a little bit of payment to a bigger bill.  And it's not like I owe a LOT of money, just a little, but still...  frustrating!  

Which means as I am now working part-time, I can't take for granted that my paycheck will cover what I owe.  Not that it always did when I worked full-time, but that's cause I don't pay any attention to how much I spend!  For a long time it didn't matter because I really did have more money than I knew what to do with - so I started doing silly things with it, like become an ebay-aholic and getting monthly memberships to things I don't use.  

But now it's time to reign it in a bit.  No more random piercings or tattoos.  (Last tattoo was $375!).  No more ebay (gaaack!).  No more shopping for things I don't need - I already have too much stuff, especially clothes, so I should be looking to get RID of things not add more."

"event","I had a wonderful long weekend and am really enjoying my part-time work... until I had a meeting today with my supervisor/teammate.  She's got some issues with actually preparing for meetings so she will instead of READING my emails with the important info she had asked for beforehand, she'll print them out while I sit waiting for her and then reads them out - out loud - in front of me, and asks me questions she can and sometimes does answer for herself.  *sigh*.  A little frustrating, though I'm sure it's no worse waste of time than writing this entry... ok actually this is good therapy and I'm sure I will be more clear-headed and hard-working afterwards!  

Also I STILL feel hemmed in somehow; this year perhaps since the move(s) or perhaps since she came on board I've been feeling more and more watched-over and slow-thinking and less and less independently-working and hard-working.  I definitely get less productive when my work is questioned or my time is spent in a way I consider wasteful.  Or when I'm given a job I really don't want to do - like definitely this past year I have been intensely involved in training other people how to do things.  Both my supervisor (she's caught on, finally!), as well as my lower-level coworker (who hasn't; he drives me nuts cause he won't think for himself but will instead always be asking me questions, though he's not supposed to ask me anything as I'm NOT his supervisor!).  Drives me nuts.  And now they want me to train up a new research assistant who will be working here the other part of the part-time that I'm working.  

You know, work isn't as nice as it used to be.  I don't know why that is exactly - maybe it's because since I started working full-time it's been encroaching on other areas of my life or just involving me in higher-level decision-making and writing and supervising/training esp. which I don't really want to do... Some days I just like coming in to a pile of articles to assess (read and critique) and quietly working away on them until I'm done for the day, and not actually TALKING to anyone.  Or maybe it's just I've been working here for a long time and I'm not as into it as I once was.  Problem being partly I know I'm treated REALLY well here (good pay and relaxed atmosphere, for the most part), I love my coworkers (for the most part), and the topics themselves are fascinating... and did I mention I'm paid well?  ~lol~.  But I used to enjoy coming to work and now I just enjoy the time spent AWAY from work... why is that?  Is it cause I feel over-watched so I slack off cause I can't concentrate so I feel guilty when I'm here so I just want to be somewhere else?  Or is it cause work genuinely doesn't hold the magic that it used to?  The last-minute questions where we need an answer in 48 hours, can you do it?  And now instead we have three months to answer a question and we're constantly pushing the deadline back...  endlessly editing both the papers that we write and the templates that we put them in.  Wasn't this once about the information and the answers, not about perfecting a writing style? 

I dunno what to do about it exactly; I definitely feel better working here part-time, though my plan of working more from home (which I solidified with the boss) has been cut down rather unexpectedly today by my supervisor just in case they maybe need me in the office to answer someone's question who shouldn't be asking me questions anyways cause I'M not their supervisor and have insisted on NOT having that position... *rant, rant*.  On the plus side I've reminded my supervisor that I'm taking July and August off as unpaid vacation (I've told her quite a few times already, and my boss as well, but it keeps slipping my supervisor's mind), which she claims never to have heard before, and I said I'd keep reminding her :)  So that's cool, I'll have a few months of summer off and perhaps will go to Turkey for the 40 day sema... then again, I'm having other issues with Sema and mother... perhaps I'm just having issues with responsibilities that I've taken on that I don't necessarily want.  Why have I committed to doing the Sema again?  Cause I don't know if I really want to; the formality of it kills my spirit in a way (though I've certainly found my spirit some of the time), and the ""every Wednesday"" thing feels like another noose or rein upon myself... weird I know as I chose it, and I love to whirl, but something about that rigidity is really getting to me.  Argh.  

Maybe I will chill out over time - I certainly found some time to chill over the long weekend.  I think I'll be able to work from home more than I've just been told, and I think working from work won't be as bad anyways since it's only three days a week.  Also, my lower-level coworker who works in the same office as me (hence the constant dumb questions - excuse me for venting) is now in only two of the days that I am, so he HAS to find another person to go to with his questions, or learn to figure them out himself.  So I think I won't be as frustrated overall after a few weeks of this part-time stuff, and if I can extract myself a little more from the opinion/decision process (otherwise I get all worked up!) then life may be a little less stressful for me.  I'll try and think of myself as an expert advisor or something where they can ask me for my advice and I'll give it, and they can do what they want with it.  Again, I think I'll be a little more relaxed that way!

Tomorrow is off again, and seriously off too - I have a Mathnawi class in the evening but that's it.  I may do some things like a dance class or rock climbing or yoga or the gym or something, but only if I really want to... depends on how my tattoo feels, I'm not supposed to have any ""friction"" on it according to my artist :)  Kinda hurts cause I got it yesterday n took the bandage off this morning n washed off the goopy stuff on it, which involved a bit of rubbing/touching, which made it hurt.  Alas.  

It's still Ramadan but I'm skipping today as we have a lunch meeting, or just a lunch anyways.  Not being rude by refusing to eat.  But now I feel undisciplined.  There has GOT to be a middle-ground here!"

"event","Today I went to my local tattoo/piercing parlour and designed a new tattoo for myself.  A beautiful big rose on a bed of leaves and two smaller roses connected with curling vine tendrils.  They say they can make it VERY realistic so that makes me VERY happy :)  So excited about it!  Prob will run me around $300, and will take about two hours to do.  And will hurt like hell, most likely!  But it makes me happy.  got an appointment for the week after I come back from vacation.  Dunno if I'll feel like dancin that evening tho  :|  Maybe too much pain, and rubbing on it would be bad idea!  Don't want to injure it, if ya know what I'm sayin!  ~haha~ I'LL heal just fine but I don't want the tattoo hurt ;)  Anyways I'm super-stoked about it though already a little nervous in a way.  

That's funny it reminds me of when I was in hospital every morning for a week and they kept putting IV needles in me to pump me full of antibiotics.  And I don't mind needles much but as time went on and they put more and more in me I'd have more and more issues.  And one of the nurses rolled her eyes at me and said ""you're a heavy-metal girl, this shouldn't bother you!""  ~lol~ commenting on my piercings I suppose.  Anyways YES I used to like needles rather a lot as they were associated with good feelings (no more details necessary), and YES I have seven piercings and three tattoos, but I'm STILL needle-shy :)  ~haha~ it's the anticipation that gets to me ya know nerves and all!  

Anyways I'm very excited and it will also help me with the whole possible intrigue happening when I get back.  I'm leavin some drama behind as I go and I dunno if it'll be there when I get back.  Maybe not?  It's been much less dramatic this past week or two and I definitely feel much better after this last weekend - I think I had a detox of the drama that was left in my head even after the real drama had dealt with itself.  Actually ok the drama was probably ALL in my head ~lol~ but it certainly SEEMED real at the time!  Maybe I was just bored ;)  ~haha~ boredom is a major contributer to serious dramatic intrigue, as boredom is dangerous and deadly and serious dramatic intrigue is just frustrating, so given the choice between the two drama is what I end up taking.  ~lol~ gotta find a different way to get my kicks ;)  

Speakin o which I think I gotta do me some ""homework"" for hip hop history!  Cause I like to think that I have the knowledge that goes with the dance when really I only have bits and pieces that I'm given by people I care about... maybe a good book will help me :)  Or internet resources...

On that note I'm off, time to go home, pig out (er, I was gonna eat somethin healthy but feel more like a cinnamin bun... maybe I will pick up strawberries n peaches on way home and eat those instead they're yummier really?!  But in few days I'll be gone anyways n eating will be all screwed up royally by different place n family n Ramadan too!), and get myself on Messenger to talk to some friends about some things, apparently.  Too lazy to go dancing tonight, maybe it's the ""food"" I'm eating (I doubt a chocolate croissant and coffee count as food really) or maybe it's the chillin out after the weekend of mind-erasing sohbet but I'm feelin lazy in a good way, like I wanna sit around and watch TV but will be happy while doing it.  Maybe I'll clean my room.  Probably a good thing if I'm gonna be gone for a while, especially if I want someone to feed the animals!!!

I like it I like it, and I feel much much much more settled and less generally panicked than before!

"event","Alas, I think I'm workin my body too hard again.  It starts to complain after a while, you know, and understandably so.  I give it lots of exercise and little rest.  And when I get lots of exercise I don't eat as much.  Weird, I know - I think it has to do with emotional eating, ya know, like instead of emotional eating I do emotional exercise so I don't need emotional eating.  Course sometimes to land at the end of the day I need something a little heavier otherwise I'd never be able to sleep.  Finally realizing that now and so am eating something more substantial than fruit when I come home and have a nice big cup of chamomile tea with milk and sugar, along with the large amounts of water that I need to replenish my poor dehydrated body.

Argh, now I'm just thinkin tired.  ~haha~  Not quite tired enough to have a nap I think, but kinda almost.  I went to a dance class at lunch today and was like... argh my muscles hurt!!!  Monday is my ""day off"" - i.e. I don't go dancing in the streets for four hours.  Instead I take a dance class at lunch, and another in the evening, and today I may drop by the climbing gym for about 30 mins too before heading home to zikir and then a SHOWER, or hopefully the other way around.  I guess that's not really a day off, is it?  Hmm I should re-think that.  Doh, I don't really have time to ""rest""!  Maybe... how about Thursday?  I could take a yoga class or something, or maybe just have a nap in the evening before my study class.  Yes, that sounds like a rest day.  And at lunch I can find a sunny spot and lie down.  YES!  I'm learning!  How cool is that???

Of course then the problem I run into is that if I'm not over-obsessive about dancing, then what AM I over-obsessive about?  It seems to me that either I'm obsessive or I'm lazy... but then maybe I just haven't given myself a chance to see if I can lead some sort of balanced life.  Instead I wait to see if my schedule will deal with itself (sometimes that works, and it certainly will get better as of October when I start working part-time instead of full-time!

Except that I just wrote a schedule for myself, and it's full, and then some.  Alas.  Perhaps I don't need a whole DAY of rest if I learn to rest in the breaks during the day???  Argh this reasoning and excuse may make sense to the brain but perhaps not so much so to the body.

Now if you'll exvuse me, I have a couple of dance classes to go to... this issues is obviously not yet resolved!  Must... not... injure... self..."

"event","I ate noodle soup and some chow mein and broccoli, and now I'm depressed.  How did that happen?  I'm outta energy and sad and just want to go home and cry or nap or preferrably both.  

Odd.

I was happy enough before that, maybe getting a little bit run down but not really... went dancing at lunch and met some Tibetan monks (shaved heads and orange-and-red robes) which I thought was extremely amusing... came back and even got a little more work done (I'm slow here!)... then debated on whether or not to skip outta work early and go to a House dance class.  But as I got here at 10am, I thought leaving at 4pm was probably a bit too much.  So instead I stuck it out and ATE and watched a South Park (I know I know, real productive!).  And now all I wanna do is cry and sleep.  What the hell?

So ya I assume it's somethin in the soup or the noodles that did it.  Cause right after I just don't feel so good.  And now I can't tell what to do about it - am I better off giving into this feeling and going home and sleeping?  Or fighting it off by heading out dancing?  I won't enjoy the dancing as much but it will probably be really good for me - don'tcha think?  Then again I really don't want to dance on a stomach this full :S  

Sigh.  Maybe today I will just go home.  Or maybe I will have a nap here and see how I feel... yes that's probably best.  I'll curl up in the corner of my office and take a little nap, and when I wake up I'll have enough time to either go dancing or go whirling.

"event","A friend and I were talking last night about relationships.  Well, actually we were talking about a lot of things, but I thought it was a good intro to what's on my mind.  One of the things we were talking about is unpredictable people.  The kind where some days they're awesome loving friendly people, and other days, they're assholes.  Everyone's like that to some extent, of course, but these people are so RADICALLY different from day-to-day that they keep you constantly guessing, constantly trying to figure out where you stand with them.  The more unpredictable they are, the more you obsess about them.  

Much like rats.

OK, maybe that needs a little more explanation.  The conversation kinda led here: ""They've done these experiments in rats, and what they find is the more unpredictable the rewards/punishments given, the more the rats become obsessive, trying to figure out why - WHY - did they get the reward/punishment and how they can get/not get it again.  Same thing with dogs, really - beat them half the time, and they just LOVE you.""

But I don't want to be a furry wite rat (most of the time, anyways), and I DEFINITELY don't want to be a beaten dog.  But I can sorta see how that's working in my life, turning me into a rat, as it were.  Half the time I'm like ""ooo he likes me, he's so sweet and nice"" and the other half the time I feel almost verbally/emotionally abused.  Course it's not really THAT bad, I exaggerate and am kinda sensitive as well, but still... it's not really that good for my psyche!  But I can see what that does to me as well - I think to myself, well if he can hurt me with a few words, then I MUST really like him cause I care about what he thinks.""

If that's not the dumbest thing ever, then... no nevermind I'm sure there are dumber things out there.  But it's still really dumb.  ""Wow I must care about someone cause he's mean to me and it hurts.""  And therefore... what, I should spend more time with him?!  I would LOL but it's too sad (sad in a disappointing/depressing/pitying way) and also that sometimes actually happens to people.  And I also exaggerate, but that really helps me to see what's going on.

So what to do about this person, I don't know.  I like him when he's nice, I really do.  He is also one of my beloved teachers (anybody reading up to this point should probably know how I feel about teachers), which gives him special status and meaning to me.  Mind you, I've certainly had strange issues with teachers before.  One memorable one finally went to visit his parents in New Zealand so will be away for a few months, which lets me sort out my life before he returns (assuming he will, which I do assume).  He had issues, pretty much with everybody.  Somehow he didn't have issues with me, and therefore I became his ally everywhere, even though half the time I didn't really agree with him (just didn't actively disagree).  Mind you we went through a relationship crisis when I told him I was too young for him (i.e. I didn't want a physical relationship), and many issues spanning many months arose from that.  Hmm, actually come to think of it, that WAS a period of emotional uproar; all the problems of a relationship without the sex.  Damn.  Maybe I should try going out with someone more boring, but then they would be, you know, boring!!!

Where was I.  Oh yah trying to figure out what to do.  Or actually, scribbling all my problems (large and VERY small) down on paper so I can get them outta my head.  It actually helps an amazing amount.  

Well I have to say as interesting as a nicely-screwed-up-unpredictable relationship would be, life really is already interesting.  Really it is.  And it has the potential to become even more interesting in all sorts of GOOD ways.  So why would I want to go chasing after the bad kind of interesting?  I mean, really, it's kinda dumb.

Fortunately for me, there is going to be an ending to the chaos - at least for a while.  Or I should say, I get to run away from the chaos for a bit.  I ran INTO the chaos when I went to that camp, and I will run AWAY from the chaos by going on a bit of a retreat.  As in, two weeks on the other side of the continent with a wonderful community of dervishes who are very kind caring and gently sweet.  Where I can think about something other than dancing and boys.  Or, hopefully anyways!  

Actually September is going to be a bit wonky all over.  It's Labour Day weekend this weekend (hey long weekend, I forgot!  Cool!) and there are two club nights and a couple of good long days at Robson Square planned for me... and the next week, school's in session!  I only have one class (though it should be very interesting - a 400-level Philosophy course on Environmental Ethics, by distance ed too), but there are lots of clubs and things that will be starting up... mind you many don't really get going until September, but still.  It'll be nice to be part of student life again, they're just more chilled, more intelligent (often in totally useless ways), and more laid back than the slightly more pretentious and less friendly outside world.  And practice sessions will start up on campus so I can have a good time practicing breakin without a million awesome breakers lookin on.  Just like five awesome breakers lookin on instead...  Hmm.  Well they dim the lights and people are friendly anyways.  Also, the dance classes tend to have easier choreography and less amazing students (yay!), and... well I just like it there!

And then I have a Baba weekend, and then go on ""retreat"" for two weeks, and then come back and it's Ramadan for three weeks after that as well.  So Sept/Oct will be a movement back to my roots and a re-discovering of my spiritual side, as it were... and basically make me less stressed out and more relaxed/fun/laid back.  Or at least that's the hope!  

I really feel that over this summer I've been striving to be someone I'm not.  Which is actually kinda cool cause then I actually improve at things and can be proud of myself (though I don't usually bother!).  But it also means I feel like I've been hanging out with people above my status, hanging off coat-tails as it were.  And trying really hard to be ""cool"".  And I don't know how true that is, but it DOES feel like I've been less comfortable being me, which sucks and is honestly just not acceptable.  I really have to like being me!  It's like a requirement for happiness.

Anyways I ramble, as usual, which is the point of this blog, but I DID want to say that I have really really really enjoyed my summer and learned a lot and changed A LOT and it will be interesting going back to school (not that I'm really in school, but still) and seeing just how far I have come from when I left it in March.  T'will be fascinating, I'm sure..."

"event","The more I dance this way, the more I love it.  I love it when I see it, I love it when I learn it, I love it when I try and do it myself in my room.  I love that expression of energy, I love that feeling of the pure anger comin up and bein OK, in fact necessary to the dance.  Not ugly anger, not directed anger, just... anger.  Maybe it's therapeutic; I've never been terribly good at expressing anger.  Maybe it's just a nice change.  

One thing I've definitely noticed is I MUCH prefer being angry to being frustrated.  I never really realized how much difference there is between those two, until I started a little krumping (I won't say I krump, I'm not really good at the dance, I'm just really really really into the feeling of it), and felt what anger proper feels like.  I usually live in a state of some frustration (manifesting as stress).  Frustration is an interesting feeling because it makes everything more complicated than it has to be.  As if it escalates itself; first you're thinking of all the things you have to do today, and then you start thinking about all the things you have to do tomorrow, and then you start thinking of all the things you can't do that you want to do, and then you start thinking that you can't handle anything anymore, just too much pressure, and resentful at others and yourself for being so demanding, and just wanting to watch South Park and eat potato chips.  Whereas pure anger is purifying.  It is straightforward and direct, and doesn't mess around; it makes everything simpler, and does away with all the fluffy stuff on top or the ""what ifs,"" and gets straight to the facts.  When I'm actually mad about something (perhaps when my frustration reaches a breaking point where I finally get angry and am therefore willing to DO something about it), I want to deal with that something.  Not deal with all the possible things around it - hurt feelings (others or mine) or being rude or whatever.  

Actually, when I learn about krumping it seems to me like it's very competitive after all, and rudely competative at that.  But sessions... they seem to me to be all about a lot of people expressing a lot of energy in a really active way.  And I want that.  Where do I find that???  L.A., it seems...  Damn.  Well I wanted to go anyways for SugaPop, but I don't really know how much I can do both at once.  And what do I do in the meantime?  There are very very very few people who krump around here, despite having four workshops taught by the Krump Kings.  I don't really know where all their students ended up.  Well OK one of them is my dance teacher, and I do really like his style; he taught a bit of it today.  But he doesn't feel he knows enough about it himself to teach more than a bit of it.  Apparently a friend of his (who I don't really know) went to LA for a while and earned some respect, but with a slightly different style that I don't know about nor have seen so I can't comment.  (I like the rough, rugged, aggressive stuff... pure anger, ya know?  I get enough of tricks and goofiness and girliness through other styles of dance, thanks very much!)  And apparently no one practices it.  I mean, come on, SOMEONE must.  I have a ""friend"" I pop with who occasionally does a bit of krumping in circles at clubs, but more for fun and to mix things up (he likes to play).  But there are no circles or sessions or families here.  How amazingly sad.  

So when I came out of class today I had the energy to just go and do it - to post around about krumping sessions and see who shows up, where to meet, what to learn, how to practice.  Amazing what happens when that spark is lit in me!  A little over-eneregetic, maybe.  I even was extra-short and clear at work about what we were doing, when I got back from class.  After a while I decided I should knock this new-found clarity and energy out cause I just couldn't settle down, so I ate curry with rice and bread and I think I'm almost normal now (if full!).  Gotta keep remembering how much food affects me, my energy, my emotions, my psychology, my mind-state.  

Distracted rambling at this point.  Gotta go catch a bus."

"event","You know, I'm sitting here thinking of ways I can ""improve"" especially in dancing... but oddly enough, not improve AT dancing so much as improve as a dancer.  Or, perhaps, grow as a dancer.  Which is probably a soft and polite way of saying, I think I'm trying to prove myself in a region I'm not sure I care enough about.

That's also easy to misinterpret... it's not that I don't care about dancing - I totally totally do.  It's just, I mean why would I want to make a name for myself in the dance realm?  I REALLY don't want to dance as a career, and anyways, I LIKE my career, it's fun.  But somehow it feels like I'm pushing myself into taking it more seriously, into working hard at it and improving and learning to dance in front of others and then in front of an audience and then in front of the WORLD!!!  As it were.  

Perhaps I'm being pushed?  Are there other people who are trying to get me into it?  I don't think so... but then, I know I treat my dance teachers differently than most would.  I mean, they're hand-picked, as it were, people I really care for both personally and of course dance-wise... people who have the FEEL that I want, as well as the style... but these people of course are teachers and performers, and the closer I get to them, the more I feel like that's where I want to go or what I want to do.  Which is a bit silly because of course I DON'T want to perform, not really... do I?  I'll get back to that.  I don't really know if these people are pushing me in any way shape or form... I mean, I know they push me to be better and to be a good dancer, but I don't REALLY know if they're pushing me to perform or anything... Both teachers have dance crews, and I could theoretically someday join them... but... WHY???  I mean, I would learn a LOT.  And I would get better FAST.  But would it be fun or would it be panicky-scared kinda learning?  And do I want anything to do with that?  

And I'm sure that these wonderful nice people are not really pushing me anywhere.  It's just that I'm extra-sensitive to these things.  In fact, I'm probably just too sensitive in general.  But I'll leave that for another blog.  As is, what is interesting is two things.  One is, I look up to and respect these people as I have put myself under them as ""student"" which somehow means far more to me than showing up to a class now and then (I'll get back to that in the fall when I take more classes I don't care as much about, but these people and their classes... I'm a regular, bordering on stalker LOL).  Which means when they have the least bit of encouragement, frustration, enjoyment, etc. I see it, feel it, and am affected by it.  Far more than I think I ever was by a boyfriend, LOL, that's funny come to think of it... And anyways, on the other hand, when I get frustrated - either with them, which occasionally happens, or more commonly with myself - then I start thirsting more to prove myself, to myself or to them.  Which means... when I'm happy with them I want to get better, and when I'm not happy with them I want to get better, and when I'm not happy with myself I want to get better (or sometimes just quit everything and go back to what I know - scuba and freediving, why did I give that up anyways?).  And so all of the above makes me think... I should practice more, I should freestyle more, I should club more, I should get used to dancing in a circle, I should get used to dancing with a partner, I should get used to dancing on stage, maybe I should even get used to teaching a little something to someone.  

Except for the whole part about me which is like, dancing is fun, I do it for fun.  I have to keep reminding myself of that... why is that?  I shouldn't have to REMIND myself that dancing is fun, should I?  Shouldn't I just KNOW it every time I dance???  Damn, probably a bad sign.  So why would I make it even HARDER to remember that by doing something like, I dunno, dancing on stage?  Isn't that even worse than trying to practice between classes???  I mean, it's one of those things where I KNOW that, if I ever get there (not to get ahead of myself!), for days and days beforehand I'll be stressing out and wondering... WHY am I doing this again?!?!  LOL like where I am before playing music on Sunday nights.  Though I'm sure if I play enough I'll stop stressing so much and just have fun... cause it IS fun.  But in the meantime, very very very very very stressful!!!  Even just thinking about it now, thinking I should be practicing (except that my drum is LOUD and it's 1am), and groaning being like ""I don't REALLY want to practice""... why is it I keep turning things that are fun into things I stress out about???

Speaking of which, I just re-joined an old studio I used to frequent... it's funny that I dance, right, and I keep thinking ""one day I'll be good at it and dance on stage,"" and really I HAVE, I just keep forgetting!  Cause once upon a time, when I was just starting to learn to dance, I was a happy student of pole dancing!  Yes yes yes, I know, weird much, and NO I've never taken my clothes off in public - except at a nude beach, or the hot tub in that campground, or... well anyways - especially not to music, and certainly not to tips ;)  I was just a student, I just wanted to have fun.  I didn't really tell anyone, except for a girl I used to b-girl with, and then my breakin teachers found out... oh yah that's funny I guess they know too.  And I have a nice pic on myspace of me upside-down on a pole at a club.  So perhaps I'm not as good at hiding it as I used to be?!?!  Haha!  Anyways, where was I... oh yes, so I started learning pole dancing just when it was starting out in my city.  I joined both studios (there's three now but I've not heard good things about upper-level teaching in the third, I won't say more than that), and learned SO much so fast... I've always had a relatively strong body and arms, so compared to most of the girls I could do a lot of crazy moves.  In the process I managed to do... one competition (self-made choreography to a song, in a club, on a stage), one photo in the local paper (under a false name), one night of background entertaining at a really big party (four sets of 20mins, OUCH!), and one modelling show of fantasy clothing that my pole teacher was putting out, at a big party at a casino.  And of course there was also impromptu dancing (as in, free pole time!  But on a stage) at a mud wrestling competition as well as a club/bar not that long ago!  Er... did I say I had no show experience?  No experience dancing on stage?  Was I lying, or did I just forget?!?!  LOL how could I forget all that?!

Anyways I re-joined the studio I used to go to after going to see strippers for a friend's b-day.  Or more accurately, eating all-you-can-eat sushi (thank god I was late otherwise I would have eaten way too much!) and fresh-homemade cheesecake, then going to a very interesting clothing store and trying on the widest selection of barely-there clothing I have ever seen, then going to a strip club and having an interesting chat with a very friendly drunk guy who was explaining to us that he really didn't smoke but he was going to pretend he did in order to impress us - course thefact he told us sorta gave it away, but he was nice enough - as well as having the DJ mistakenly identify me and a friend as celebrating our lesbian wedding.  Hmm, come to think of it, that was an interesting night!!!  But it reminded me how much fun pole-dancing is, so I joined back up, and she remembered me (a year and a half later!) as a ""pole star"" (like a porn star???) and welcomed me back with wide (feminine, well-sculpted, muscular) arms.  And everyone is friendly and I'm GOOD at this dance (even though it's been a while) and it just feels right!

I'm digressing so majorly right now that I'm a little skeptical of my ability - or willingness - to get back on topic.  On the other hand I just reassured myself quite a bit.  I HAVE been on stage (wearing the flimsiest of clothing and spending a lot of time upside-down), I CAN dance (in A style, anyways), and it really is quite a bit of fun!!!

So where does that leave me?  Nowhere different really than when I started this email, at least not physically... but mentally I DO feel better.  I have made no resolutions nor have I decided what opportunity to chase down... things will happen in time if they're meant to.  I'll keep dancing, taking classes, and practicing.  I'll take my opportunities as they arise; they're likely to in the pole-dancing world, where I'm apparently known and loved, as odd as that is!  So if I was looking for recognition and acceptance, I can find it there.  If opportunities arise in other dances and other aspects of my life, so be it, I will follow them wherever they lead... and somehow learn to balance work with fun (thank god for part-time!  My job is awesome!) and see what happens WHEN it happens, rather than trying to make any decisions ahead of time.  Cause it seems to me that Some One Up There is really trying to get it in my head that I should be following HIS path not trying to blunder around on my own with a map I can't read and too many ideas of where I'm trying to get to!

This does still mean that I will take some time off next summer.  I'm planning on taking two months unpaid vacation... with too many ideas of what to do with that time.  Originally I wanted to go to Turkey and chill in Istanbul learning Turkish and loving the city.  Then I wanted to do that during the week and tour with a dj/band on the weekends to whatever country they were flying to.  Then I wanted to go to LA and learn poppin, lockin, and whackin from some of the originators, and it would be very cool if I could learn krumpin from the original krumpers as well, though I'm a little nervous about rollin on their side of the tracks, as it were, as dumb as I feel saying that.  And I'd definitely love to head to New York and dance at classes, in clubs, and on the streets.  And also go back to Calgary to that wonderful dance camp.  And of course there's dance camps here I'd like to take as well, as the summer schools are actually filled with wonderful teachers flown in from everywhere!  So as far as I can see... it will either be a sufi or a dancing summer next summer, and I don't know which yet, but fortunately at this point it doesn't matter.  All I need to have is the time off work and enough money to do what I want to do (note to self: save!).  And I should just really let go of the overpowering desire to make a decision and then plan everything!  I usually get so antsy if I don't make a decision, pretty much any decision but the bigger the decision the more antsy I get!  So this is my nice training to be patient and wait and watch/listen for the signs that will show me which way I need to go... rather than getting all hyper-organized or getting too psychological (I should do this to get over this fear, or doing this will make me this kind of person).  

Also... really got to lose the drama :S  LOL!  It seems to me that I LIKE being dramatic and I think it makes life more interesting... when really it just makes it more stressful!  Time to chill out...  Yes I KNOW it feels good in a strange way to be able to say, I've been in the hospital most of the week and they want to cut my neck open, but I'd honestly rather just get better and NOT be cut open :|  Yuck!  Anyways half the time I just get all martyr-y and don't tell anyone, just suffer in silence with pride that ""they don't know what I've been through...""  Yes yes I know I'm messed up psychologically, but at least I DO know that and can see it and hopefully someday can rid myself of it, rather than just knowing about it and trying to dampen down the effect it has on my life.  Speaking of which... daydreaming again, gotta stop that, it's never really as pleasant as it seems!  Especially if it involves people I actually talk to, as then I just get all confused when life doesn't follow daydream, as it were.  Better off just being as present as possible and enjoying the moment... which is one thing I learned from dealing with doctors (of all kinds!), is that I get into a happy state of being fully present around them so I can answer their questions as accurately as possible and learn as much as I can.  I should do that ALL the time, not just in hospitals!!!

And that's enough of this rambling, I gotta sign out and get some sleep.  Working from home tomorrow, that'll be nice, no commute!!!  I really do want to get some work DONE as well, it's frustrating when I don't.  I'll work here tomorrow and then plan on going in on Thursday - Friday I have to take off early for a dance class, a doctor's appointment, and then two more dance classes, oh and a zikir, and then a club later (most likely)... hmm I know I really should take it easy, right?  Oh well I will chill for two days and then see where I'm at!

That's all for now, folks!"

"event","I don't think I'm passionate enough.  Or emotional enough.  Actually a lot of the time I think I'm TOO emotional, which is why I try to be even less emotional than I am.  Which is dumb, cause I'm just not emotional enough as it is.

Not that I want to be, like, a high-strung basket-case, but I DO want some more passion in my life... and I don't mean physical passion (though I'm certainly not against that), I just mean PASSION passion.  The kind where you FEEL things deeply.  The kind where you aren't afraid to LOVE or fear rejection, humiliation, whatever.  The kind where you are, well, HUMAN!  To the greatest possible extent.

How do I become human, I wonder?  It has nothing to do with what clothes I wear, or hairstyle, or whether or not I keep up on the latest gossip.  Being human is about feeling, and also about relationships.  Again, still not thinking sex y'all... I mean like any form of communication between people.  It's this connection that really makes me FEEL, ya know?  Sometimes happy sometimes sad sometimes angry... but definitely a feeling!

Time to ponder that as I run off... gotta go to my next interesting thing :)"

"event","On another note, I'm very confused about friends and what to do about them - I have friends, and that's cool, but what do I do with people who aren't quite friends yet?  There's always a confused time in which you're not sure where things are going or whether or not you really want that person to know you or how much time and energy you're willing to spend on someone, or a group of someones.  But then maybe just I think that, cause I think too much.  But I wonder how much I should be friendly and become a friend, or if that's too pushy and I should chill out and be an aquaintance or let ""friends"" develop naturally, or maybe that makes it look like I don't care... tough tough call.  Of course when you add in the fact that I have my nice walls against most boys getting too close (stops me from having to refuse them later, but is built so solidly these days that I just don't end up staying friends with them, nor letting the ones I WANT to get close get close), plus that I really am still shy, especially in groups, then I run the risk of never ever making friends.

OK so the likelihood of that is really quite small, isn't it?  Well I certainly hope so.  There are definitely nice people out there who I end up being friends with because they're just so consistently nice to me that they break through all my barriers (defences and shyness) and then we get along just fine.  But honestly... why do I make it so hard?  Shouldn't I be easier to be friends with?  I keep wondering if I would be MORE friendly if I had a boyfriend (or girlfriend, which at this point I'm seriously considering, but possibly for the wrong reasons), cause then I have an automatic excuse not to go out with someone.

Wow I didn't realize how much of my defensive psychology seems to be geared towards not going out with people.  LOL!  Craziness.  

The theory goes, if I HAVE a boyfriend/girlfriend/significant-other, then I can just drop that word ""boyfriend"" and then not have to worry about expectations of other boys.  Course last time I did that it really didn't work so well, and I ended up with a bit of a stalker despite my boyfriend.  Hmm, actually I may have an important point there... but I may just ignore it cause the point of this entry is to convince myself to be MORE friendly, not more cautious.  Anyways.  There's got to be a better way of dealing with things, though I suppose if I get desperate for a bf/gf there are people I can call to remedy that.  Which is very cool, but probably definitely very much the WRONG reasons for getting into a relationship!!!

OK that's enough rambling cause I really am starting to wander all over the place, at least in my brain.  I think the antibiotics or perhaps the whole medical ordeal I'm undergoing is just making me a bit more sensitive and emotional than I should be / usually am.  Then again maybe it's time to be more emotional rather than cool and laid-back.  Then again, I think if I were just healthy I would be able to cope with things much better and BE more friendly as I would be less self-conscious.  But hey, whatever.

On another note, I'm not terribly sure writing emotional emails to almost-sorta-friends is a good thing to do.  I should keep reminding myself of that until I learn, I suppose.  I've already written one emotional email, and I'm sorely tempted to write more, but will keep myself in check - next time I feel that emotional, I should run it by a friend before sending it out to the world!  Friends are a wonderful resource to help make sure you don't say what you will later regret.  Thank God I have some close friends that I can ask for advice!!!

Rambling done.  I'm out."

"event","Wow, I just glanced at my last entry and I seemed so relaxed and upbeat!  Things have changed a bit since then... since that very evening, actually.

So, I have a gross thing on my neck.  An ""abcess"", which is basically a lump that's not supposed to be there.  They've decided it's an infected cyst (which I could have - and did - tell them when I first went in over two weeks ago now), and they've explained (over and over and over again) that once they get the right antibiotics then the thing will settle right down and be gone.  

They said that the first time I saw them two weeks ago, and gave me a week's supply of Keflex.  When that didn't work, they took a culture, and then gave me a week's supply of Cipro.  Then my family doctor took a look and she decided it was worth looking at more closely, so sent me to the Emergency room of a hospital close by.  They looked at it a bunch, and poked and prodded at it until it really really hurt and was all red and inflamed, and then decided I should be on intravenous antibiotics (Anceph).  They stuck a needle in me and gave me a good dose, then sent me home with the needle still in my hand which was PAINFUL and very difficult to type with (let alone drive home!).  The next day they had me in for more antibiotics (I made them take the needle out this time) and also an ultra-sound-assisted aspiration.  I.e. a different doctor poked and prodded at me, took pictures of the inside of my neck, froze me up with that stuff they put on teeth that need to be drilled, and then stuck a big needle in me and took out some gross stuff - and made another culture.  It didn't look any different after that, and they sent me home.

Then the next day they gave me more antibiotics and were upset when I didn't have a nice needle in me for them, and equally upset that I didn't want a needle left in me.  Eww, gross.  After a nice big dose of intravenous Anceph they made me wait around for an hour and then sent me in a big rush down to another hospital to see an Ear-Nose-Throat specialist.  My sister asked me to pick her up on the way over (she's been VERY kind and helping drive me around and waiting in the waiting room with me!), so we both ran over to the Emergency of the other hospital, signed in, and then waited.  And waited and waited (hence the name of the room, I suppose), for almost an hour.  We were running out of card games to play!  We also thought the ENT would go in with a knife and cut me open and drain all the gross stuff out of me... but the resident I eventually saw, in various very short chunks of time in between getting paged by Emergency, for emergencies no doubt, as well as running to check with his supervisor about treatment options - we were in the room for almost two hours but only got to see him for around 15 minutes of that - he told us that it was really better to wait for the culture from Wednesday to show some results, as cutting it open may complicate things later on.  Fortunately he got me set up with an appointment next week, and said at that point if it wasn't better they'd cut it open and scrape out the insides and pack me full of sterile gauze and leave a piece of it hanging out, so that if the pus tries to fill it up again it will just automatically drain out.  Cause keeping a wound open is always a good idea???

So today I ask about the culture, as my treatment options seem so dependent on it.  Turns out the one from Wednesday isn't growing ANYTHING.  Now THAT worried me as, if it wasn't bacterial than there were major questions to be asked... but he reassured me that it was probably just that they had given me such high doses of antibiotics that it wasn't going to grow anything.  Which is nice and all, but if the antibiotics are killing the bacteria they have tried to culture, why aren't they killing the ones in my neck???  So I asked about that culture-gone-AWOL, the one they did at a walk-in clinic on Sunday and the results are mysteriously not turning up anywhere... they phoned the lab and finally found them, the results aren't in because though they did find one bacteria (a form of Staph), it was also showing signs of two anaerobic bacteria that they couldn't identify so they're re-culturing it and now we have to wait again.  Fortunately they switched me from Anceph to something that covers the form of Staph they found, so at least one of the three bugs growing in me is now being adequately targeted.  

SO frustrating.  They want to leave an IV needle in me as well and I said they couldn't today, but tomorrow they can if they want.  I don't want to dance today with an iv needle in my arm, but tomorrow is mostly hanging out with some friends (a birthday party!) and I can always cover it up with a shirt or something.  And of course I can show off my nice new fashion accessory (like a very early-version of cybernetics and robot-human hybrids) to everyone tomorrow and get lots of sympathy, which is the only positive thing about an epic story like this one has become."

"event","OK!  I started a new entry cause this one's upbeat and focused!  Same topic, really, about how to reduce stress or more accurately to improve on my ability to handle stress.  Plus self-discipline (i.e. having such control over myself) will help me feel positive and take my mind off the crazy things in my life I feel I have very little control over.  Hmm, that sounds like the psychology of an anorexic, that's problematic... but I have no desire to be scary-thin, I just want to be HEALTHY, as healthy as humanly possible (including psychologically, which means far more moderation than it sounds like I'm doing!)

So here goes another attempt at raw food.  Mmm raw food.  Perfect time for it, it's summer and all the yummy fresh local fruit is out!  And I'm not aiming for 100% this time, cause I'll fail and feel bad, so instead I'll just go for AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE just raw fruits and veggies with a bit of cooked veggies thrown in for filling and in case I get too emotionally rampant.  Potatoes seem to fix that.  And I GOT to stay away from the dairy!  I mean, I have to anyways cause of this bloody antibiotic I'm on, but I also hate it when I eat it, but still eat it out of pure pleasure in the mouth and strangely the desire to eat something that is ""forbidden"" actually makes it more enjoyable.  Dammit.

Anyways we will see what happens, if I can do mostly raw for the rest of the week then I will take the next week as it comes (have a good friend from out-of-town visiting so there may be eating of junk foods), and the next week after that, etc... I know once I pass a certain point I will stop saying ""it's impossible for me because_____"" and I'll just get used to doing it.  It's always the excuses I make for myself that bring me down... like last night I was so frustrated waiting for and having to go on another antibiotic that I ended up buying a bag of cookies with it, and they're not even THAT good, but I ate them anyways, and then felt dumb about it, and I don't know what to do with the rest of them (eat or give away?).  

Wow I'm vaguely embarrassed that I have such normal problems LOL.  Used to be that I didn't have a problem with food - i.e. I didn't care about it at all.  Didn't like to eat it really, got no pleasure from it really, just had to do it to stay alive so I ate only under protest.  Then I developed friends who liked to go out and eat, and I went out and ate with them... and learned to cook... and gained weight, so true to form I read everything I could get my hands on and learned to cook healthily... then went vegan and dropped to a normal weight VERY quickly... then slipped back to lacto-ovo-vegetarian and have been attempting to improve my diet - sometimes successfully, sometimes not - ever since.  I'm much healthier now I think than I was, certainly before I went vegetarian... but the amount of thought I put into my food and therefore the stress around it may or may not be healthier on the whole than stress-free junk food???

I'm being too hard on myself.  Well, there's a surprise.  Here's a nice affirmation for me: every day in every way I'm getting better and better.  And when that doesn't work, there's always a philosophical rambling I can wander into, wondering what ""better"" really means anyways, and why we work so hard to get there, even if we never really CAN get there...

I started this entry saying I'd be focused.  How interesting where it ended up."

"event","So this is how it happened: I went to my massage therapist, who was doing maintenance on my injured leg (I wanted to show it love after two weeks straight just dancing dancing dancing!), and saw the nice big gross lump on my neck (result of a bacterial infection that I'm now on a SECOND antibiotic for as the first didn't work), and he suggested I go see a particular naturopath about it... who isn't taking new patients for almost a whole other year!  So instead I agreed to go see one of the other naturopaths in the same office practice thing.  

I should point out here that my work's extended health care covers $500 worth of expenses for chiropractice (sp?), acupuncture, naturopathy, massage therapy (with a doctor's note which I have), etc., that's $500 EACH, so I'm more than willing to spend their money and learn something about taking better care of myself while I'm at it.  It's actually quite a sweet package!  

Anyways so I am filling out a very long intake form for the naturopath, and it's amazing, answering all these questions about symptoms that I could have ""rarely"" ""occasionally"" ""often"" or ""frequently"", I'm really thinking that I'm a lot more sickly than I had previously believed!  Which is why I'm writing this... am I really sickly and just hadn't really thought about it before, or does answering 30mins worth of vague questions about minor symptoms prime me to think that, wow I didn't know I had so many problems!!!  I mean, yes I have a hard time getting up in the morning for work (wow, eight points against me!), and yes sometimes I have trouble concentrating or feel restless, and yes I get tired and cranky when I skip a few meals, but does that mean I actually have a health problem?  Doesn't everyone have those problems, they seem common enough?  Does that mean they're actually just part of being human, or is the status quo for health these days so low that we take a diseased and fatigued state as normal healthy functioning?

I  mean, what I really want to know I suppose, is will they actually be able to HELP with that.  Like, honestly if they can do something about getting me out of bed on time in the morning, I'm all for it!  Or if they can make me less easily frustrated or more emotionally stable or whatever.  (Mind you I didn't know I was emotionally unstable before I started filling out this form, but now I'm thinking it may be a problem :| ).  Even if everyone else in the world is grumpy in the morning, if I don't HAVE to be, then I'm certainly pleased about that!

Mind you, I know there's a lot of things I can do already that will sort out some of my issues.  Like last night I had a bit of an emotional release when I realized during zikir just how blessed I was to have such a big loving family of spiritual questers like myself who I know are truer friends than you would find pretty much anywhere and who even if I hardly know them I could call them up if I were in trouble or really needed to talk... that is just such a beautiful thing!  So I was overwhelmed by that and just cried my little heart out in joy for the blessings and apologies for ever forgetting how blessed I am... and after that decided that large amounts of dessert would really help me settle emotionally.  So, chocolate, cake, and cheese dip-and-chips later... well, the last few days of good eating were sort of overcome :|  So obviously to me that means I need to release emotionally more often (therefore less intensely when it happens), and NOT turn to food afterwards, even if it is put in front of me.  I should have stuck with the fresh mint tea, honestly!

So where was I, oh yes, I sort of have issues seeing the point in going to see yet another person who will tell me yet another way to improve (I get this all the time, be it ""practice music more"" ""dance more, with someone there to watch"" ""meditate more"" ""stretch more"" ""relax more"" ""study more"" or whatever!), even though I have lots of ways I can improve that are stored up in my head just waiting to be used!  Perhaps I should focus on what I can change now, rather than finding even more things I can change?  Especially as I may be likely to run up against ideological differences, the more people I go to for advice?  But then again, maybe it WILL jump-start my health, or perhaps it will be the last push I need to do something about it (whatever it is) and change, or perhaps I will learn something vastly new and different.  And anyways, it IS free :D  So not really complaining!

But what I am wondering about is how healthy I really am?  I started wondering that... well as my injury hasn't fully healed yet (very much better though, thanks for asking!), and as I have a bacterial infection (and writing out my history, it's one of quite a few I've had, though it's the first since I started caring about health a few years ago now), and as I really am tired cranky and stressed out... but HONESTLY... it's mostly just stress-related.  ""Just"", LOL.  OK but my theory is this: I should be able to handle a certain amount of stress.  If I want to handle more stress, it just means I need to also take better care of myself.  Rather than reaching an unbalanced breaking point."

"event","So... do I plan and schedule my life to the extreme, taking up all my free time doing activities that I have decided will better myself in whatever way I choose to better myself?  Or do I learn to HAVE free time and chill out a little, de-stress and have fun?  

You'd think there would be a middle ground?

But no, apparently for me it is, as usual, all or nothing.  Perhaps my plan will involve learning to relax - is that possible to plan?  To plan for free time?  It just seems to me that I do a lot of stuff, so much so that when I have a day where I'm not doing stuff then I don't want to do ANYTHING just for a change.  So days off are not chillin with friends or going to the beach or playing music or whatever, instead they are SERIOUS days off where I try my very hardest to do absolutely nothing (i.e. sleep a lot and watch movies or read already-read books or muck about online).  Which is honestly kinda dumb cause I'm sure I'd enjoy the day much more if I DID chill with friends or go to the beach or play music or whatever.  And then I get a strange dichotomy of really intensely busy periods where I wish I had time to chill and/or practice what I learn, and in-between harsh chill times where I do NOTHING as an attempt to counter-act the busyness.  

For instance, right now I could be at a dance class... or a yoga class... or go for a bike ride... or walk in the woods... or go to the beach.  But I'm sitting indoors typing out my heart on a computer.  Granted, that is actually therapeutic, but before this I was ready to watch South Park episodes online with a bag of potato chips.  Good thing I don't actually HAVE a bag of potato chips here otherwise I might have.  OK, change the subject quick, before I get any ideas!

Where was I.  Oh yes, well I'm thinking about where my life wants to go, for the simple reason that I have a thing for a boy who's not returning the thing and therefore I'm like, pssht whatever I have better things to do.  Now I have to actually FIND better things to do to prove it :)  I'm not actually quite that shallow (at least I don't think so), but there is certainly a level of frustration there that I suppose I should take as a sensitivity to rejection... then again it did fuel a quick-but-intense dance session on my own channelling all those frustrated/angry feelings (much better than feeling rejected LOL) into something that was almost a krump but way more random and not half as good-looking :)  But give me a break, it was a first attempt to really feel it, and I DID really feel it even if the movements were not at all pretty :)  So maybe I should feel frustrated and angry more often, as it obvously unleashes some larger dance styles and rids me of my over-over-over-self-consciousness... hmm channelling emotion, good point, will work on that.

Along with everything else I need (I should say want!) to work on.  Like dancing with a partner.  

OMG they have touch contact improv here!  LOL that seems random I know but it's really not - I was intro'd to touch contact improv by a dear friend who teaches it in the States, we had a session after zikir he on one side and his twin brother (lol not related but they look alike sound alike both are architects and both whirl) on the other side and WOW that was crazy I loved it!  Very sensual and yet not sexual, if that makes any sense.  Anyways, I'm super excited about it, and I think I can drop in on the class, though he did warn me that some touch contact improv groups get a little, well, orgy-ish or gropey.  We'll see what happens I suppose.

Er ok anyways I wanna get into some different dance styles to improve the ones that I actually care about (lol sounds funny), which is a bit silly cause if I really did care about them wouldn't I work on them more instead of spending the time going to other classes?  Odd.  But anyways I DO want to try different styles and I'm excited to think I will have some more free time come the fall to do so (switching from full-time to part-time work!!!).  

My mind just went a different direction so I will start a new paragraph.  Motivation is a funny thing.  See for me there seems to be two main motivations to do something (and work at getting better at it).  One is the love of the person who does it - I have a tremendous respect and love and attachment to all the people who are my teachers.  Not just who teach me something, but who I TAKE ON as teachers - for instance I have a few dance teachers who I love to learn from and I take all the classes I can by them - not cause I'm a stalker (I hope not anyways!) but because I love the way they dance I love their attitude towards it and towards their students and I totally respect them as people as well as their opinions.  The other motivation I have is... pure frustration.  Usually it's people-frustration - I'll be upset at someone who I dance with (who usually dances better than me but maybe I keep hanging out with the good dancers - how else am I supposed to improve?), and that will make me really really really work on my dancing because I can't stand that someone I can't stand is better than me at something I care about.  Fortunately that motivation is short-lived (usually!), cause it's not really a HEALTHY motivation, if you know what I mean!  I'd much rather learn from respect than from disgust :|  But sometimes it can be a good jump-start to things when they get a bit stagnant (i.e. I don't try hard enough!).

So right now I'm in a mix of the two, I have the interesting position of being frustrated with someone I learn from and care about.  Which means I want to get better out of love for him, and I want to get better out of spite for him.  For me... well for me I just want to dance :)  What is dancing ""better"" or ""worse"" anyways?  A feeling is a feeling.  Dancing for yourself, it doesn't matter what it looks like.  Dancing as a form of communication with others, as a form of sharing with others, as a form of community, well of course it's going to be for with and from other people!  

Phew, had to take a creatively-inspired break and write a piece of that on myspace for everyone to see - much more polished than here, of course!  

Which pretty much tapped me out.  It's a good process me thinking that out... and I always think better on ""paper"" (except electronic paper not only wastes less trees, it also is less likely to get lost (knock on wood) and may actually be read by someone I care about at some point!).  I of course have only a vague idea of who I dance for, I can name a few people and also say I love being part of a small community - which I'm not now, in a strange way, in great part because I'm still nervous dancing in front of people!  Dammit... that will soon be remedied (or, soon be worked on until I finally am not so frightened of people!!!)

S'all I got for now...  more next time I feel so inspired :)"

"event","My whirling teacher wants me to train to go on tour next summer with a band/dj.  ""Every weekend a different country"".  What would be interesting as well is as the band/dj is based in Istanbul, it would be easiest if I just LIVED in Istanbul for a few months and flew around from there.  Which ties in with my desire to live there for 6-8 weeks to learn Turkish and immerse myself in the culture some more.  Interesting how these things line up... and I already planned on taking a few months unpaid vacation next summer as well.  Sweet!

Of course this originally came up because he's doing a show in Germany this weekend and put his back out.  Fortunately his doctor said he'd be alright to perform, otherwise he was going to ask ME to fly to Germany (on three days notice, after just coming back from out-of-town)and perform in front of thousands of people.  Mind you, with turning it usually doesn't matter who I'm in front of as long as I'm really whirling - the only One watching is God, and the only one I really whirl for is God, and that I can do.  

I was wondering how on earth I was going to make time for the training it'll take to get ready to do performance turning, when my Iranian music teacher called and said he's going to New Zealand for three months to be with his family, in about a week.  So that answers that question!  He set me up with a friend of his (and aquaintance/friend of mine) and we're going to jam at a restaurant on Sunday nights now.  Sweet!  Much less pressure to be ""the best tambour student in North America"" now (his words, not mine!), and a lot more opportunity to listen and have fun and learn by doing.  Plus it's way easier to play drum than tambour anyways so I get less nervous about it!

In other news, after being away at a two-week-long dance camp, I have lots of new skills to practice and things to learn and a desire/motivation to work at it and excel after seeing so many good dancers and even more importantly seeing people be so happy when they dance!  I'm happy dancing as long as no one's watching LOL I have to fix that: ""There's no such thing as a shy dancer.  You can be shy OR you can be a dancer.  Take your pick.""  Also, spent more time hangin with an AWESOME guy and crazy dancer who I take lessons from in Vancouver but haven't really gotten into the lessons enough - I mean, I've been way into the poppin scene so working on that going to classes taking home the ideas and going to clubs to see if it makes it into my dancing.  Which means all the house and whacking and the bit of krumping etc. that he teaches has been slowly infiltrating my body but not on purpose, as it were.  Now that I've been with him more, seen him dance more, taken more of his classes, I really want to work on it... when he gets back into Van and starts teaching again I think I'm going to videotape his routines and actually work on them at home.  I'm going back now and re-learning Pete's routines from these past few weeks and there's a lot of crazy stuff in there!!!  Anyways we will see where that takes me who knows... there are two awesome crews in Vancouver that I could be a part of if I wanted - the poppin crew and the freestyle/house-y crew, each headed by one of my dance teachers.  I have to learn to freestyle in public first though!!!

Who does that make me, I wonder...  It seems to me that all these things are working towards making me less stage-fright-ish, less shy, more outgoing and less self-conscious.  And friendlier and more open too as the people involved are super-friendly.  Also I get a taste of the world and perhaps a little taste of fame - will my name be known?  It is in the scuba world (even now, and I haven't dove in years, people are still talking about me!!!), was a bit in the freediving world (though I think the bathing suit helped LOL), definitely is in the sufi world (whirler, singer, drummer, tambour player, listener, general server), and perhaps will be sometime soon in this dance world - as soon as I get over my shyness and FEAR of becoming known... two drives going head-to-head, the desire to be known and the desire to be invisible.  My Dear One seems to be pushing me away from that shy invisible me, and I do love Him, so I follow, and I suppose will have to give in to whatever person I end up becoming because of it!  He does set this all up for me, ya know, there is no way I could PLAN my crazy life...

Of course now I want to push that being in front of people more... I think I want to take acting lessons in the fall, my university does a bit of a non-credit course for fun in beginners acting, I think it would be good for me.  I'd also LOVE to take voice lessons too, to help my sufi world in singing and also to turn my speaking voice into something more melodic and enjoyable (at least for my ears!).  I wonder if I have time for it?  I suppose I'll know if I'm supposed to do that now because it'll either be easy to get to and fit in my schedule and be relatively inexpensive, or it won't, and then it will be obvious that I'm not supposed to do it.  See how I follow this path of mine... no such thing as coincidence, so if it looks like coincidence, it's something that's meant to happen :)

Where does it all lead, I dunno, to the grave eventually and union with my Beloved, and what else really matters?"

"event","Way too much going on in my head.  In a nice period of quick transition I think, I feel like a much different person than I did just a few weeks ago.  Flew out to a dance camp for two full weeks and something in the dancing and the movement and the partying (drinking, talking, dancing, etc.) and the interesting things that happened to my own dancing in clubs was just, well, different and life-changing.  I sorta knew it would be but it's interesting how things go.  Now I just watched Rize which btw is an awesome movie though it took a bit to figure out what they were talking about re: dancing clowns, but I suppose it's just not part of my culture... anyways made me feel like I had energy that I wanted to channel that way, like angry and frustrated and etc. energy that just doesn't get let out otherwise.  I want to learn a bit more of it, then just DANCE it and ride that energy into a trance like riding the whirl into a trance... I wanna feel that anger and the power that comes from it the rawness of spirit and the shedding of outer forms of beauty or discomfort or whatever and just THROW it.  Alas I come a little too late the krumpers have taught classes here several times and I never went, never felt into it enough.  Such is life, I know these things are meant to be.  

In the meantime I'm back into the fashion game, I wanted to change it up some and wear less black and more interesting things but instead I've chosen black interesting things :)  Ebay again, it's amazing the stuff you come up with when you search ""DIY"" (do it yourself).  One-of-a-kind, indeed!  Half the stuff is more about giving me ideas than about buying anything, but we will see.  Have to admit though still my fashion sense is with the punk/goth side of the world.  I have exquisite taste when it comes to vinyl corsets and baggy black pants, not to mention mini skirts, but outside of red black and white I'm a little lost.  Ok I can do extreme casual as well with faded greens and beige/khakis, but that's really where I fell OUT of fashion into.  I tell ya, if I actually just gave in and went back to being punk/goth I would be very well-dressed!  We'll see what happens... I'm afraid my personality simply doesn't match that look.  Mind you, I can always make it my own :)

So tomorrow I will be off biking around I think, I have to keep myself in shape after that ""boot camp"" got me beach-ready, and I need some fabric paint as well as maybe a dance class or yoga class or both... and also a good night sleep, so I'll sign off now."

It's cool cause, well I can't help it it's how I am, but I also enjoy it, and in my head it's all tied together and follows from each other and just seems like THE thing to do right now, whatever it happens to be.

"event","This spring/summer I've had too many things I've done to my body - piercings, tattoos, you name it.  That's quite enough of that!  With the exception of my first waxing experience in a salon next week (well, that's the plan anyways), I really am done with all this stuff and will let my body get used to it's changes.  It's been very kind to put up with me all this time...

The waxing, incidentally, is cause I'm going away on vacation for two weeks, and there's no way I'm shaving all that time, and I'm likely not going to always be wearing pants.  Unfortunately (or fortunately, or coincidentally anyways) the place I want to get my waxing done is doing a sale where it's actually cheaper to do a full leg and brazilian than it is to do a full leg and bikini (which I originally wanted).  So, I'm going to be kind of bare this summer :|  On the plus side, it will help show off one of my piercings (assuming I head to a nude beach), and I could actually get away with wearing the bathing suits suggested to me by a guy friend of mine, who is very into women's fashions especially lingere, whereas most of the guys I know would say they could care less about it, which doesn't actually make them more masculine as I've realized that women's fashions are a very normal thing for guys to like, especially when it involves skimpy clothing.  Run-on sentence, but the I think I got my point across.

So AFTER that I will... well go to a beach with some friends and hang out.  LOL actually that would drive me nuts after a while, I can't stand to do nothing for long... but for a day or two, yah totally.  After that... 

After that I'm going to see if I can re-negotiate work for the fall.  I've never been as tired, stressed out, or sick as I have been this past year.  Now, I was taking some classes at school, going on a trip to Turkey, and my job physically moved offices twice, ending up much further away from home and downtown in the end, which is trafficky and polluted and a long long bus ride, but on the plus side is close to EVERYTHING.  So, yah it's been a stressful year.  But I want to relax.  I don't mean I want to do nothing or hang around watching TV or whatever (though that does help with the whole relaxing thing), but I DO want some breathing room!  I mean, I don't need the money I'm making, unless I make it, in which case I seem to find ways to spend it... but I would rather have more sleep and more free time to learn what I want to learn, than to make money I spend on silly things.  Seriously.  So if I can manage to negotiate part-time for the fall, then I will be an extraordinarily happy person.  I can do afternoons at work and take the mornings for myself: wake up a little later, cup of tea and a slow breakfast, shower, maybe even bike to work for once!  Rather than now, hitting the snooze button till the last possible minute, then running around throwing things in my bag and rushing off to the bus stop with no food or drink, trying desperately not to miss the bus as the next one is 30 mins later... bloody bus... anyways.  See how the first one was so much more relaxing?  I got a bit of that today as I took work home last night and did it this morning - got up a little later, had breakfast, drank tea and assessed articles for methodological rigour with my lizard crawling all over me.  Now THAT is a good way to work :)

Totally rambling now.  I guess this is the place to do that."

I've done enough against it, now I will be trying to do things FOR it to make up for things and put our relationship back on solid ground.  Yes I do realize I just personified my body into a whole other being, but it kind of is in a way, just as my mind is, and my spirit is.  I assume that my consciousness operates on the spirit level, and uses my mind to think and communicate in a way that others can understand (well, theoretically), and uses my body to travel in.

"event","So I do some crazy things in my life, I admit it.  Sometimes things that only I consider crazy, and sometimes things that everybody considers crazy, and sometimes things that are crazy - though the third is actually much less common than people realize.  The term ""crazy"" is often used as a stronger term for ""weird,"" which is of course entirely socially constructed and therefore different with each culture.  Except for some things, which are truly crazy across cultures.  And of course now I can't think of an example, because for each example I can think of I can also think of an exception where that wouldn't be considered crazy, so I'll just have to let you think of your OWN examples.  

Suffice to say, I'm not truly crazy, though I am flattered when people call me so.  Why?  I suppose it's because then I feel different.  And I associate different with standing out, and being a real person.  Rather than being a person who is trying to be like all the other people.

Which is of course a fascinating thought - I mean, what is the difference between someone who is desperately trying to change themselves to be ""normal"" in order to fit in with the rest of society, vs. someone who is desperately trying to change themselves to be ""weird"" in order to stand out from the rest of society?  These are extreme cases, to be sure, but hopefully they can illustrate my point... the point continues to say, that if the person is desperate to be a different person, then they probably won't be cool regardless of if they're trying to be normal OR weird.  Or at least, I knew a person way back in high school who tried really hard to be cool, by trying really hard to be weird, but honestly it was just sad.  I've also seen people so driven to be normal and fit in that no one really accepts them.  So perhaps it has nothing to do with whether you want to be normal or weird and a lot more to do with how hard you try for it and probably more importantly how much you like yourself as you are.

But I think I've totally digressed.  It was an important digression, because it helps me see where I fall in my newly-constructed little scheme of things.  I fall somewhere like this: wanting to fit in with people, but also stand out within whatever group I'm a part of (while still being part of a group - or three), but also liking myself, though shy.  

Does that mean I fall in all the supposedly-discreet categories I just constructed?  Cause, damn.  Well, obviously I suppose the categories have possible overlaps, as in they are not mutually exclusive nor opposite, though they appear to be opposite based on their labels/descriptions.  Hmm.  Now I'm getting too philosophical I believe, and unnecessarily so.

All I was meaning to say when I started this entry, was to do with the support, reactance, and/or pressure of people on things that other people do.  To illustrate my point, I will take myself as an example: me, my actions, and my friends and family's response to those actions.  I point no fingers and lay no blame, I'm merely finding this to be a fascinating exercise.

I have a friend who is extraordinarily supportive of the strangest societally-questionable acts.  Not unethical or anything, just, well fringe-group type actions.  She and I have the most wonderful conversations about things that most people would never consider.  For instance, because of one of our conversations, I ended up getting a vertical clit hood piercing (which I'm now very proud of).  I probably wouldn't have dared if I hadn't talked to her about it - both because of the pain involved but also because I wasn't sure what the next guy to get in my pants would think about it.  Now instead I think, screw you if you can't deal with it you don't deserve me.  Which is a bit strong, but I did have a strong worry about it and whether or not it would be accepted, so I had to react strongly against my own biases.  That same friend has given me all sorts of interesting ideas on how to reinvent my wardrobe for the summer, including the possibility of learning to wear spike heels around the city.  I may decide to sit that one out, however, as I am too nervous about the possibility of injury.

I have another friend who chases after the big experiences - travel, strange sexual experiences, huge ideas, global thinking.  She makes me want to wander the world, and get myself into graduate school, because big ideas intrigue me.  But this big-picture person with wonderful ideals about society and feminism and how things should be, which I generally totally agree with, therefore has some difficulty with the side of me that is vain and superficial.  I admit I have a side that's vain and superficial, just as I have a side that is extraordinarily philosophical and a side that is so spiritual that sometimes it feels like it annihilates all other aspects of myself.  Anyways, this wonderful girl gets all flustered and confused when I allow the vain aspects of myself to come out to play.  Yes I'm a big-picture thinker, and I do believe in making my own decisions rather than having society make decisions for me, but sometimes my decisions end up the same as the ones people generally associate with societally-overrun people.  Being a steadfast individual doesn't mean I can't do those things that people who are societally-overrun do; in fact it is far better to not be affected by societal pressure than to either give in to it OR react against it.

I have another friend who has a stable life and we do a lot of talking (and biking).  He's awesome to talk to, partly because he doesn't get pissed off when I make my forceful statements.  I don't know why I make forceful statements sometimes, it just seems so right sometimes, and seems only to happen when it's supposed to, as in where it will do good, so I just let them out when they want out and it seems appropriate.  He's also awesome in that he's good motivation for a serious amount of exercise, which I don't get from other people as others are always like, ""wow you're fit"" rather than ""we gotta get out and do something active!""  Don't get me wrong I like it that way, as long as I actually AM fit, which I'm not right now, which sucks.  But that's my personal view of myself anyways, which is different than other people's.  Anyways he's been around me long enough that he generally accepts that I do weird things, but also shows just the right amount of surprise to keep my ego happy with whatever I'm doing :)  (Is that a good thing?!?).  He also makes me think about how well my actions and my words go together, which is often less well than I think/hope.  But the vanity is again shuffled into the background - I can't seem to be accepted as both vain AND intelligent.  They're not mutually exclusive, you know!  

I spent a bit of my youth only caring about what I looked like, not what I did.  I spent a good deal of the rest of my life not caring about what I looked like in favour of caring about thoughts and actions.  Then I realized that they weren't mutually exclusive, in fact, they were mutually enhancing.  Actions could be made more or less obvious by looks, and looks could help actions both in effect and in functionality.  These days, I try and do both.  I still have far more action and thought in me than I have looks and fashion sense, hence the focus these days on trying to bring my look up-to-speed with my actions.  

Does this really constitute vanity?  I'm still stuck on this subject, I see, but it's obviously bothering me.  I don't want to be a vain person, yet I am by my own definition, the problem being that my definition of vanity is a bit, well dumb, and more to the point, over-overarching.  Not everything is vanity, or possibly vanity is not so bad as we make it out to be.  I think I've written on this already though, so I'll try and stop before I begin to rant again.

I started this entry with the idea of social pressure.  So I'll go back to it, related to friends and family.  What I just did was flying in the face of a whole lot of social pressure NOT to do it, vs. social pressure TO do it, which is usually considered to be the case.  Also, I like to think that at this point of my life I am more free from social pressures to do anything in particular than I have been at any time before this in my life.  Perhaps this is just an age thing, or perhaps it has to do with higher education, or perhaps it has been the breaking of boundaries or whatever.  I don't really know.  But I think I'm the least under societal control now than I have ever been in the past.  

I don't know where I'm going with this any longer so I will stop there...  And also say that all my friends are wonderful, in case any of you felt maligned by my comments.  I'm lucky to have you all.

Yes, I've totally lost track of my train of thought!"

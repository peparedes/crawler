Yeahh.

I haven`t been on here in ten million years, sorry.
Not like anyone actually reads this shit anyways. xD

School`s shitty, but when`s it not?
My classes suck.
Besides for third period.
Which is Psychology.
It`s really fun, and Mr. Walker is pretty cool.

Mm, yeah.
Erica`s coming over tonight.
So, you know..
haha

What an amazing update.

So things have been better than they have in a long time lately.
-Nobody to tie me down
-No gay ass friends to deal with
-No bad grades

I like it..

Progress reports came out. I`m on top of that shit, man.
Geometry- 92%
Marine Bio- 97%
World History- 105%
Dance- We haven`t gotten it yet, but I know I have an A.

I`m all out with the old, in with the new, and I`m really focusing on the things I care about, and not on things that don`t matter anymore.

Props for me.

Leave me comments. Bitch.

girl died in 1933 by a homicidal murderer. He buried her in the ground when she was still alive. The murdered chanted, ""Toma sota balcu"" as he buried her. Now that you have read the chant, you will meet this little girl. In the middle of the night she will be on your ceiling. She will suffocate you like she was suffocated. If you post this, she will not bother you. Your kindness will be rewarded. 

I got back from the wrestling match a little while ago. Another royal ass-whooping, might I add. I thought we were gonna suck this season, but I was wrong. Hopefully we'll go undefeated again. That would be awesome =]

Homework sucks big hairy man ass. lmao Erica.

Mmm. Taste of Chaos Tour is comming up soon, and I have nobody to go with. And I'm not about to go with Nick. So hit me up if you wanna come.

Rotary was on Friday and Saturday. I got out of school all day Friday which was cool. They had me running a table the whole day though so that kinda sucked. But Oh well, it was fun. haha

Saturday I was in the JV room filling out 354351354684 million bracket sheets. I swear, I'm never writing again. Then I ran a table during finals, and I ended up going to the walk in movie for like 30 minutes.

Yesterday I went to the lovely Erica's house and chilled. We had fun. hehe. Omg, I almost pissed my pants at dinner, I was laughing so hard. Her dad knocked over his beer and he's like ""oh damn"" so he picks it up and knocks it over again! Then he's all like 'I meant to do it that time..' lmfao he's too funny.

Today I'm just chillen... I wanna see JJ. My mom said he came over twice this weekend, but I wasnt home. =/

That's about it. Payce out.

A lot of stuff's been thrown at me, and I don`t exactly know how to handle it all.

Finals are soon. Like in a few days soon. 

Spanish... I have a 67% in it.. Which is gay cause I have a million zeros, most of which I did my work and actually turned it in, but the teacher just lost it. She does that a lot...

Home life is always hectic around the holidays. >_<

I feel distant from everybody. Like I don`t belong..

Could just be me.

I need to clean my room, and get Christmas presents for Erica and Renee soon.

hm. I just don`t know. I have this feeling inside of me.. like something's missing.. I`m empty. I get that a lot around this time of year. I think I have that seasonal Depression Disorder thing maybe?

Leave one. Or two.

Look at me, you can tell
By the way I move and do my hair
Do you think that it's me or it's not me?
I don't even care
I'm alive
I don't smell
I'm the cleanest I have ever been.
I feel big, I feel tall, I feel dry (dry)

[Chorus:]
Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake [x4]
Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake [x4]

Do I drink? Do I date?
I've got perfect placement all my ink
Satisfied, in your eyes
I'm the biggest fan I've got right now
I made sure, that I look how I wanted to look
The people around me, the people surround me
I feel big, I feel tall, I feel dry (dry)

My stomach hurts now, and all tied off in lace
I pray, I beg for anything, to hit me in the face
and this sicknes isn't me, I pray to fall from grace

And I'm telling you I'm a fake [x4]
And I'm telling you I'm...

Any 3 no matter how personal, dirty, private or random. I have to answer them honestly. In turn you have to post this message in your own journal and you have to answer the questions that are asked to you.
I stole this from Chelsea =)

Hmm, today went by so fast! It was a bad day though, idk why.

First period we had this wicked huge test, that I had no Idea about, I hadnt even looked at the chapter, so that sucked. 

Second, we got this new girl from London. She has the accent and everything, she's so cute! I wish I talked like that.

In third, were playing soccer. I've realized that the only two things that make me happy are soccer and my friends, <333 so that was pretty neat. I shot on goal, and my shoe went flying off! haha good times. 

Fourth was gay, as always. I actually sat there and took notes like a good girl, instead of sleeping. Were studying the evironment/evolution, like we did in Mr. Honigman's class. It was cool. I think I might wanna do something along those lines when I grow up, but I'm not sure.

I'm thinking about making a new LJ, a friends only one, cause I'm sick of people I dont even know posting in here, and not telling me who they are. 

I hate people. I really do. 

Saturday night was the shiznit, I'll never forget it. I love my two *bestfriends* more than anybody in the entire world and that will never change. Thanks for showing me how to have fun again. I love you girlies. ;) <33333*

mmm, that's about it. 
Leave a comment for your favorite bitch! =P"

I had a game this morning. We tied, 1-1, I scored... it's all good =D Thank God were getting better.

The baseball field was... interesting. lol. Man, everybody thinks that there's something like going on, it's pretty funny. Chelsea prolly knows what I'm talking about. haha

"event","The Taking Back Sunday concert was so kick ass last nite. 
I didnt get home till like 1, but I dont care cause I had fun.
Well I had fun till I got out of the pit.
One of the security guards totally called me baby and grabbed my ass!
I was like ""Oh fuck no!"" and i slapped him, and ran away so he wouldnt kick me out. lol
And some OLDDDD guy was there, he was so drunk and he was following me around -- thank God I found my dad. haha
I lost Erica on the first song, as always, but me and renee actually were together most of the time.
And I'm bruised all on my left arm from some asshole consistantly punching it until I decided that my fist should be in his face.
Fall Out Boy is now my second favorite band
and I fell in love with Adam alllll over again.
I saw a lot of kids from school there.
Good times.
I told MaryLynn that the next concert that I go to, she has to come and mosh with me.
Should be fun.
And Meagan, my dad had my camera the whole time, so I didnt get any pictures of the lovely Adam!
I'm so sorry!
But you're still my lover! =D

My ankle's doing better, but I'm not gonna play in my game on Wednesday, just in case. I dont wanna totally blow it out, and then be out for the rest of the season. That would suck soooo bad. =(

I woke up at like 7, and went down to the soccer fields, and found out it was picture day. I looked lke shit, but oh well. I played my game, and things were going well, when this girl comes straight at me and steps on my fucking ankle. Dude it hurt soooo bad. And the ref was a dumbass and didnt even stop the play. I was so pissed. And it was the first time I ever cried when I got hurt during a game. I swear, I thought my foot was like gonna fall off. haha. But thank god it's fine now. But we ended up losing our game 5-1 which made me sooo mad. Our team sucks man. -_-

I ended up falling asleep for the rest of the afternoon (Morgan, that's why I didnt call you. I'm sooo sorry! I love you, and were chilling next weekend no matter what! =D) When I woke up I had to beg my mom to let me go to the show. She finally gave in. =)

It kicked soo much ass! It was the first time I went to a show, and I have to say...
Maddox has a kick ass screamer. I liked them a LOT.
And My Getaway is sooo awesome. Russo is the most gorgeous boy alive. He reminds me a lot of Adam from TBS, like the way he walked around the stage, and the ways he positioned himself when he sung. Veryyy good.

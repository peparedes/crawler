I like them though.<BR><BR></P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Don't read this, please.""> </P>
<P>I've been thinking about a ton of stuff recently. I talked a lot with some of my family when they were over today. About my uncle's wedding, relationships of people in my family. It was weird/cool.</P>
<P>I never realized how much I am appreciated. That probably sounds terribly conceited but it made me really happy just to hear little things&nbsp;people had to say.&nbsp;I know I probably don't make half the people who I really appreciate feel appreciated. I'm bad at that.</P>
<P>Have you ever had one of those people in your life who you thought was the greatest person you could ever meet? Someone you loved, who&nbsp;you really looked up to. I don't know exactly what I'm getting at. I've lost a lot of respect for that person in my life recently.&nbsp;Not so much respect but I don't really look up to them anymore.&nbsp;I don't think people realize how much they affect other people, that or they don't care. I had a really hard time talking about this tonight, like on the verge of tears. I don't understand myself. This is stupid.</P>

And you know your best friend? I don't know if I really have a best friend. Things are weird. I feel like I don't have that person to call at three in the morning just to talk to because it's been a bad week. There are tons of people who I would love to hear from at three in the morning. I wouldn't feel comfortable calling someone to tell them my problems. I don't doubt that there are a handful of people that I could call if I needed someone to talk to but I wouldn't. There's something wrong with me. Why am I even writing this? Seriously.
<P>Today was pretty cool. I got to talk to some really great people.</P>
<P>Yesterday was a lot of fun. We should do that again sometime.</P>
<P>I'm hanging out with EVERYONE this summer. It will be the best.</P>
<P>It has been decided that I should shut up forever.</P>

<P>So this weekend was pretty cool. </P>
<P><STRONG>Friday. </STRONG>Stef spent the night. She is awesome.&nbsp;I love her. </P>
<P><STRONG>Saturday. </STRONG>Not a whole lot in the day. Went to my aunt's house for my grandma's birthday. My aunt is the best cook in the whole world, oh man. My other aunt and her friend were there and they're really funny, cool people.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sunday. </STRONG>So I'm sleeping and all of a sudden Codi is in my room making rooster noises? haha yeah. Then we went to church. Later on I went over to Karen's so we could ""do our math project""...yeah we got tons done. I love Karen. Then I went home and went on a walk with Codi and we saw Kristina by the park. Cool people. </P>
<P>Codi, I will get you back. No truces. </P>
<P>Then I went back to Codi's and there were Tornado warnings and stuff so we were in the basement and what not hahaha. But the sky looked so wonderful. I took some pictures a while afterwards. They're boring so don't look.</P>
<P>Hope everyone had an&nbsp;good weekend.</P>
<P>Oh yeah and the lake is flooded! That blows. If it doesn't drain quickly my summer is ruined. Apparently the pier is near floating away and the bonfire pit has drowned. Unfortunate.</P>

<P>You know those people who you can just sit there and laugh with for hours about nothing? I love those people.</P>
<P>And those people who you can have the best serious conversation with.</P>
<P>What about those people who you never got a chance to know? </P>
<P>I've been thinking a lot recently about the people in your lives and how they got there. What if we met someone at a different time in our lives, or never at all. Why is it that we meet the people we meet? What if one of us never took the initiative? I was just thinking about how our lives could be so different based on who we are friends with. Your close group of friends, in a sense, represents all that you are. If that group was different, you would be different. Just something to think about, I guess.</P>

"event","<P>I know, it's annoying how much I update. But I have something to say.</P>
<P>Yesterday I was informed that my mother thinks I look like Lindsay Lohan. Cool? I don't know.</P>
<P>All I know is that I saw Lindsay Lohan hosted Saturday Night Live tonight (last night now, I suppose.) and I guess sex does sell. I mean I just found it very unusual&nbsp;that she's on there, wearing such revealing clothing (sounds weird of me to say). Plus the fact that she isn't even ""legal""...she's still 17. It's like some bizarre statement she's making without realizing it...""I have a nice body so I'm not going to wear clothes."" I don't know if anyone watched it I just found it very unfortunate. Whatever...she does what she wants.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So, basically I'm really stupid. This was a pointless entry. </P>

"event","<P>You know what I <STRONG>really</STRONG>&nbsp;don't like? When people think that they know and they don't. Does anybody <EM>really</EM> know all of the things that I am thinking? Does anybody <EM>really</EM> know what is good for me? I mean there are obvious physical needs that any person can point out. Nobody can tell me that they know or that they're only trying to help me because who would know what is better for me other than myself? </P>
<P>Why would someone tell me that nothing <EM>really</EM> matters now. It won't mean anything in 5 or 6 years. Yes it will. I will always have memories of today and this year. It doesn't make sense if only the future matters. The future isn't something that will come and be here because it's always the future. For someone to say that it would mean that nothing matters. Unless they mean the only thing that matters is when I die. It's hard for me to sit there and listen to this and not say something. If nothing now will matter in 5 or 6 years what will ever matter?</P>
<P>Don't pretend like you care or you want to talk to me if you don't because I don't want to talk to you either.</P>

"event","<P>So, I'm officially on lockdown now. Darn Geometry. What do I need that for? Seriously? <BR>Yes, so I have been told that I am inconsiderate and make poor choices. And you know what? I couldn't put up an arguement...I <STRONG>am</STRONG> inconsiderate and I <STRONG>do</STRONG> make poor choices. Maybe I should work on that.</P>
<P><STRONG>Today.<BR></STRONG>Cleaned most of my room. Then went over to Stef's around 3:30. Hung out for a bit. Then went over to Alisha's. We rented School of Rock, Orange County, and Virgin Suicides. We only got to watch School of Rock and Orange County. <BR>""Sean, you're my same height. That is neat!"" oh man.<BR>Then my mom picked me up only after first driving to Alisha's mom's house and supposedly calling me several times. My phone never rang once. Of course this is my fault because I should have known she was coming even though she said she would call. And I should have specified whose house I was at. Yeah...so I suck at life.</P>
<P>I have yet to finish cleaning my room or finish reading Fahrenheit 451. Damn that Mr. Simon.</P>
<P>My mother tells me Karen called. Of course I wasn't home. Man, I miss her. I wish I was there to catch the call.</P>
<P>I really need summer to get here. I can't wait. I want to go to The Lake a lot more this year. Even though we went a lot last year. This year will be more fun.</P>
<P>Contrary to popular belief squirt and orange juice <STRONG>do</STRONG> taste good together. Oh man. Had a wonderful time with Katie and Jess yesterday. Guys, we need better tools.<BR>""Hey, is this Jessica? Kaley, I'm on the phone with Jessica!!""<BR>""No, Mom. She's still a dyke."" who says that?!? hahaha. </P>
<P>Well I better get reading/cleaning. I decided I'm not going to go to sleep tonight. I don't want to. You can't make me. </P>
<P>You know I was thinking about that. You can't <EM>make</EM> someone go to sleep. Unless of course you drug them or something...</P>

"event","<P>Alright, so for the past few days we've been fixing up the boat house. Which was a total dump when we started. It looks pretty good compared to what it did before. The color scheme is totally screwed up but I think once we get some furniture in there and all set up it will look pretty cool. Hopefully I'll be able to have friends up here a lot this summer. That should be fun. There is something about The Lake that I can't quite explain. I love it up here so much and I don't even know why. It's some old house with&nbsp;some rooms and a boat house. There's nothing too it. It's just so great how you can have&nbsp;that no worries attitude up here...I don't know. I make no sense.&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'm seriously questioning who my friends are right about now. I mean some people you're just like wow...they are awesome and other people cause a lot of trouble and I'm sorry to say it's almost not worth it. The positives have to outway the negatives, I guess. </P>
<P>Jealousy is a terrible thing. Why would someone purposely try to make someone jealous? Why is everyone so jealous? Including myself. I'm a terrible person.</P>
<P>I hope everyone is having an awesome spring break.<BR>There are a lot of people I have yet to hang out with.</P>
<P>I don't know what to think about you. </P>

It wasn't a bad monday, but it wasn't a good monday. haha I was in an extremely weird mood today..I guess since I say that oh so often that would mean that I'm always in a weird mood. Which would in turn mean that I am just weird. Yes? Well this weekend was pretty awesome, I must say.</P>
<P><STRONG>Friday. </STRONG>Alright. Went to school...obviously but had that weird breakfast thing for that club I'm in. It wasn't horrible but I did look like a complete idiot. Of course the people I was supposed to escort to the stage did not cooperate..but Megan's and Codi's did quite nicely. Yeah. So after school went home then went to the movies to see Starsky and Hutch with Codi, Tyler, Megan, Shelbi, and Doug. It was pretty good. Really funny. Ah yes. That's pretty much it.</P>
<P><STRONG>Saturday. </STRONG>Didn't do much of anything. Slept a lot. Twas wonderful. I slept in until like 2. Oh man do I love the weekend.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sunday. </STRONG>Best day of the weekend. Best day of the week. I woke up and went to church..the usual. Then came home and got ready to go Downtown Naperville with Jeffrey. It was really cool but we definitely picked the coldest day to go. Oh man. It was pretty cool, we ate at Noodles and then got ice cream at Cold Stone. Awesome? I think so. We took lots of pictures...well Jeff did. I'm not a ""picture taker"" haha. Then after went back to Jeff's and hung out for a little while. It was a lot of fun. =)</P>
<P><STRONG>Today. Monday. </STRONG>Yes, today was cool...I guess. I have about a million tests this week though. That's no fun. I was in a weird mood today...as mentioned early. Yeah. After school I went home with Stef and then Lauren came over a little bit later. It was a lot of fun. haha ""You get the shirt and I'll make a blockade."" haha wow. I need..something..help, medication..yeah. Then I had to come home for dinner.</P>

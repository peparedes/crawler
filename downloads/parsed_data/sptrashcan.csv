"event","At work, I am currently seated in a lab with the rest of my project team - all men about my age.  Today, the subject of significant others and their mysterious ways came up in conversation.  As I listened, I was surprised and more than a little dismayed at the degree to which these men viewed their female life partners as opponents in a game of trickery and manipulation that both sides played to their own ends, rather than as friends and fellow human beings.  I volunteered that in the hypothetical case that I was asked a question with difficult emotional ramifications by my significant other, I would answer honestly on the basis that I was not interested in the kind of person who sees conversation as a place to lay traps.  I was told that if I rejected all potential partners who did not behave this way, I'd be left with nothing but men.

I have my doubts about that one.  But then, everything I know about women was learned through the naive method of talking with them like they were human beings, and listening to what they said to me and to each other and to anyone who would listen.  If this limits my pool of potential partners to women who want to treat me, and to be treated in turn, as friends and equals, I think I can live with that."

"event","The above aphorism should be familiar to anyone who has studied software engineering.  Less pithily, it expresses the idea that software should be written to allow a great deal of latitude in the format of its input (so that it can be easily connected to the output of other software), but be precise in the format of its output (so that it is easy to write other software that accepts that output).  That's good advice for creating useful software.

It's not just good advice for software though.  Consider it phrased in another way: be strict toward yourself, and lenient toward others.  Or: hold yourself to a high standard, but do not judge others by your standard.  As codes to live by go, it has merit."

Sadly, Zack Snyder wants to be a Serious Film Maker.  And because Zack Snyder reads and loves a lot of comics, he knows that the way to make your story a Serious Story is to add a big old pile of rape.  So the fun shooty bits are actually packed into two levels of frame story: one about a girl who is sent to an insane asylum after accidentally shooting her sister while trying to stop her father from raping her, and then another one in which the girl escapes from the harsh reality of being about to be lobotomized into a fantasy where instead she has been sold to a brothel and is about to be forcibly deflowered, because that is <i>so much better</i>.  Maybe I don't know for imagination, but generally when I try to fantasize myself out of an unpleasant situation I usually also try to fantasize myself into a <i>less unpleasant situation</i>.  Which brings up the question of just whose fantasy this is anyway, but I digress.

Anyway, if you want to see the fun movie that is embedded like the gooey filling of a Serious Rape Movie pie, I recommend waiting for the DVD and then making judicious use of chapter skip.  Because the inner fantasy sequences where the asylum inmates are the pretty girl commando squad?  Those are great.

Now, I may just not be getting it, and I might be missing the point.  Perhaps the whole point of the horribly depressing framing story is to make me question my enjoyment of the light frothy fantasy center, and by emphasizing the (totally exploitative) fun bits and denigrating the Serious Movie Parts, I'm missing the point.

That's something I think I can live with."

I first encountered his work in my college days, whilst browsing the internet at previously unimaginable speeds.  I think it was the Japanese publishing giant Kodansha's website where I stumbled over a preview of his comic NOiSE.  The lines were dark and rough, with pale shapes rising out of a boil of black scribbles.  The environments were complex (Nihei is an architect by training) and foreboding, whether oppressively sterile or oppressively filthy.  Humans looked alien, and technology looked disturbingly human.  I was hooked.

Since then I've collected BLAME!, his grim picaresque about a wanderer on a mission he barely understands in a city of unimaginable scale and profound indifference to its human and posthuman inhabitants; and Biomega, a zombie apocalypse story that turns into something more (and weirder).  I like Nihei's visual style, his incredible environments, his largely silent storytelling, his talent for depicting destruction on an epic scale, and his bizarre vision of the future of man and machine.

"event","So, now that it is not late at night, let me come back to it: the difference between building a world for one story versus many, or why I don't generally like media property tie-in RPGs.

When writing a story, it is not only acceptable but frequently beneficial that the world that character inhabits be constructed around them.  This does not mean that the character is necessarily equipped with the right skills and disposition for that world, but it does mean that the world can be a certain way for the sole reason that it throws a character's personality into sharper relief.  Is a character particularly brave, or particularly cowardly?  Either way, a world full of danger forces that character to make more interesting decisions than one that is relatively safe.  But why is the world dangerous?  That does not necessarily require explanation in the context of a particular character's story if the character is not going to confront those reasons in the course of that story, and if they are, then that reason can also be shaped to match the character.

Furthermore, it is neither necessary nor beneficial, when telling a story about a particular character or group of characters, to delve too deeply into matters that do not immediately affect them.  Where do the pirates come from?  How fast is the spaceship?  Who tills the fields outside the town?  Why do the cave worms glow?  These are all reasonable questions to ask, but if their answers are completely irrelevant to the main thrust of the plot, then a good editor will recommend that they go unanswered.

Thus, a world built for one story has two major flaws when anyone tries to tell more stories in that world: first, the world was built to fit a particular character and may not offer interesting opportunities for other characters, and second, the world may be poorly defined outside the domain that the originating story passed through.  These are not insurmountable, of course.  While some settings are extremely idiosyncratically adapted toward a particular character, especially when that character's arc involves changing the nature of that world fundamentally, others are robust enough to offer opportunities for other passings.  And each successive pass will (indeed, must) fill in more of the blank space on the map, until the details are firmly set enough that one can rely on canon to answer most questions that come up.  Of course, at this point it may become hard to tell <i>new</i> stories in that world, but that's a separate issue.

There is a third issue particular to attempting to adapt a world that has already been used to tell many good stories with compelling characters into a roleplaying game: the existing stories are so compelling that players and GMs gravitate toward reenacting the stories as written, with characters modeled after the characters as written, and end up creating poor copies.  Of course, original characters and plotlines can be just as poor, but it tends to stand out more when the originals are right there for comparison."

- It looks like the nearest open-enrollment amateur band/orchestra is about thirty-odd miles away and practices Monday evenings.  That might almost be doable.

- I am not currently happy with the state of my physique.  Between the fact that I can no longer pull up my own body weight with my arms (an important capability in a number of unlikely but critical situations), and the fact that the last time I tried to run any significant distance I pulled a muscle in my back, I think I could use a little strength training.

"event","In junior high and high school, I played horns in my school bands.  During junior high I mostly played the trumpet, but in high school I got braces which made the small trumpet mouthpiece and tight embouchure uncomfortable, so I switched to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baritone_horn"">baritone horn</a>.  I played in both concert and marching band, where there was a distinction, and with six years of practice and instruction I became reasonably skillful.  But after high school, I stopped playing - college band was too competitive, I felt, and would take away time from studies.  In the end, lots of other things took time away from studies instead, but that's neither here nor there.

In retrospect, I found evidence that indicated the truth of something that I later learned from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_%28book%29"">other sources</a>, and I'm just now beginning to put the picture together.  What makes someone ""talented"" is somewhat influenced by inborn skills and abilities, but is much more influenced by <i>enjoyment</i>.  It takes a lot of time practicing to get good at something, and in order to have the will to put in that time it really helps to <i>enjoy what you're doing</i>.  Note that this is critically distinct from a desire to be good at something - you have to want to do it, and to keep coming back to it, whether you're good at it or not.  My memories may be tinted rosy by time, but I believe I did actually enjoy causing music to come out of that horn for its own sake - it's a lovely, deep, mellow, brassy sound and I still like hearing it - even when it was difficult.

Because of that, I found another thing to enjoy as my skill improved: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29"">flow</a>.  To me, flow is the feeling one gets when a skill is practiced enough that execution occurs faster than conscious decisions: you do it faster than you could if you were thinking about doing it.  I've encountered it in other contexts - reading, typing, sometimes writing, sometimes mathematics or programming.  Some video games are good at training the player toward flow: Dance Dance Revolution comes to mind, but there are others.  I think that the flow level of skill is in some sense a phase change in how one approaches an activity.  It is like a black belt in karate - it indicates, not mastery, but a level of practice such that the student need not focus on getting each element right and can start focusing on higher levels of the craft - in martial arts, tactics and psychology; in music, expression and improvisation.

I think I'd like to give the baritone horn another go.  I'll need to find one, of course, and some beginner's guides.  I hope I can find some that provide as smooth a ramp-up toward flow as DDR did.  Methodology can make a big difference in making practice enjoyable.  By structuring drills on the fundamentals as achievements in their own right, they reduce the frustrating period where the student (that is, me.  I am talking about me.) wonders whether their effort will ever produce anything worthwhile.  Hopefully at least some of my skill will still be with me.

After that, of course, I'll have to find some people to play with.  Ah, the tricky bit..."

This apparently underread classic book of essays by Fred Brooks on programming and software engineering was required reading in the University of Michigan's Computer Science program, and I'm glad it was.  The titular essay has this central point: <blockquote>Adding more engineers to a late software project makes it later.</blockquote>  The reason is simple: it takes the time of engineers who are experienced with the project to bring other engineers up to speed, and while they are doing so they aren't working on the project.  There are other issues of scale as well: more engineers means more management, larger facilities that require their own staff, more equipment, better coordination that takes up more time, and so on.  And yet, 35 years after the lesson was learned and the essay was written, people still try to add more engineers to a software project without adjusting the schedule.  Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it."

"event","This week I have been on travel for business, in Baltimore, MD.  Today, since I have never been, I went with my coworkers to Washington, DC, which is about an hour away.  As we did not have much time in the day - one of my coworkers had his wife along, and she needed to be at the airport that evening - we took a quick drive around the National Mall area and then parked near the Jefferson Memorial and took a walk around the area.  I got brief glimpses of many famous buildings, including the Library of Congress (a place with all the books! all of them!).  I was amused by the use of the fasces motif in several statues and decorations, a design element that, like so many other good things, was deeply stained by their misuse by autocrats.

We then parked and got a good look at the Jefferson, Lincoln, Roosevelt, and World War II memorials.

The Jefferson memorial stands well for itself.  Even keeping in mind how Jefferson often failed to live up to his own ideals about universal liberty, entrenched as he was in a deeply unequal society, his words still stand as an arrow pointing toward the path that he could not himself walk.  The museum area in the base of the monument, by avoiding any mention of these contradictions between his words and his life, seemed to me to lessen rather than enlarge the man who was capable of seeing further than he could reach.  I found the keystone laid by FDR touching, and the marble drinking fountain carved into the wall of one hallway sublimely ridiculous.

From there we walked along the side of the river toward the Lincoln Memorial.  The water was half covered with ice and a large flock of seagulls were sitting on the ice sheet, along with a few ducks.  As we walked we happened on the Franklin Roosevelt memorial.

The Franklin Roosevelt memorial is architecturally understated, never more than a story tall, but long and complex.  I was very happy to see a statue of Eleanor Roosevelt included, as she was a formidable character in her own right, a strong-willed woman who wasn't afraid to stir controversy.  Franklin Roosevelt himself is depicted in the posture of his fireside chats with the nation: seated, his cloak over his shoulders and his dog at his feet, an honest depiction of a man who could barely walk.  I was deeply moved by two quotations inscribed on the winding walls:

<blockquote>I have seen war. 

I have seen war on land and sea. I have seen blood running from the wounded. [...] I have seen children starving. I have seen the agony of mothers and wives. 

I hate war.</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.</blockquote>

I can only hope that these sentiments find their way into the hearts of more people.

From there we proceeded to the Lincoln Memorial.  It is, if anything, even more impressive in person than in its many depictions.  There sits the man himself, warts and all, looking deeply tired.  I noticed that his chair is also decorated with the fasces symbol, appropriate to his struggle.  On one wall is his second inaugural address and on the other is the famous Gettysburg Address, a speech so shockingly brief by the standards of his day that his audience could scarcely believe it.  There is some irony that the speech and the man are so richly memorialized when his hope was rather that the men who died and the cause they died for would be better remembered.  Therefore I took a little time to consider those men and that cause.

The view from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial is quite incredible.  I expect it is one of the more frequently photographed views.  Is the work of an architect to create vantages from which people want to take pictures?  I took a few.

We walked alongside the reflecting pool toward the National Monument and thus ended at the World War II Memorial.  Unlike the others, I found this one more than a little disquieting, and not for the reasons that I think were intended.  The circle of pillars and wreaths, one for each state, seemed to me a rote recitation.  The curved wall of gold stars, each one representing a hundred dead American soldiers, seemed indecorously gaudy and yet also too small, comparing poorly to the mute black wall of names of the Vietnam War Memorial, almost as if they were a series of medals of bravery on the nation's chest - never minding the much greater cost in blood in Europe, Russia, and the Pacific.  The inscriptions and decorations seemed to me to celebrate war, warriors, and victory, a great big pat on the back for a job well done, and made a sickening contrast to Roosevelt's declaration of hatred for war.  Perhaps my politics color my thoughts in hindsight: the memorial was commissioned by George W. Bush.  Still, I did not like it and I was glad to leave.

We walked back along the shore in beautiful cool weather, picked up the car, and left the DC area for a late lunch/early dinner.  Our destination was the Rosa Mexicano, a fancy Mexicanish restaurant that turned out to be located in a heavily planned development called the National Harbor.  The food was quite good but the setting was so thoroughly and clearly designed from the ground up that it was downright creepy, especially in contrast to the beautiful but decidedly uncoordinated heart of DC and the messy old streets of downtown Baltimore where we'd previously wandered.  I was happy to leave there as well.

I dozed on the car trip back to the airport, and then to the hotel where I said goodbye to my coworkers who wanted to go see the Super Bowl.  For the rest of the evening, I plan to browse the internet a while and then go to bed early; I have an early start back at work tomorrow.  I expect to have more to say tomorrow evening."

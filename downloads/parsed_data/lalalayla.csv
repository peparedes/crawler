"event","<p>Ya know when something major happens and instead of dealing with that, you focus all of your turmoil on something insignificant. &nbsp;Yeah, so this post <a href=""http://www.sunnyskyz.com/blog/526/All-Kids-Have-Picky-Eating-Habits-But-These-32-Toddlers-Take-The-Cake"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sunnyskyz.com/blog/526/All-Kids-Have-Picky-Eating-Habits-But-These-32-Toddlers-Take-The-Cake</a>  has PISSED ME OFF! &nbsp;That, and doing grades, and worring about the downfall of human civilization, how education is broken, corporations rule the world and realizing I&#39;m old....

The thing is with the post is I put myself in my grandma&#39;s shoes when I read that. &nbsp;And instead of funny, it just seemed so sad and tragic. &nbsp;DON&#39;T get me wrong, I&#39;m guilty of pandering to my 4 yr. old when she wanted to only eat blue things. &nbsp;I am no better than the parents in this meme. &nbsp;But the thing is, I&#39;m also a high school teacher and have to deal with your lovely child who&#39;s been catered to and helicoptered over his/her whole life. &nbsp;S/he&#39;s been told how perfect and special and wonderful s/he is their entire life. &nbsp;S/He&#39;s come to expect mommy/daddy to work tirelessly every moment of every day to ensure that they have s/he has every moment planned and filled with entertainment and gogurt. &nbsp;&quot;Will there be snacks?&quot; is the first things HS students ask when deciding if/which club meeting to attend. &nbsp;Not the content, or what it&#39;s doing, or even who&#39;s in the club. &nbsp;Just, is there food? &nbsp;And if not the student scoffs and leaves. &nbsp;My generation are some of the shittiest and best parents yet. &nbsp;Some of us are great, raising kids without the violence or prejudice many of us were raised with. &nbsp;And bullying, nothing like when I was a kid. &nbsp;I still remember in Jr. High, SN making so much fun of my pizza face and telling me infront of band class how ugly I was and that no one really likes me they just feel bad for me because I had so many zits that she&#39;d be old by the time she counted them all. &nbsp;Everyone laughed and that was that. &nbsp;Yes I realize the cliche of a pimpled faced band geek, but I own that baby, flute fah LYFE! &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Mr. Silvey did nothing, just told her to sit down. &nbsp;Now a days, there&#39;d be interventions and conferences and such, possibly a 504 or a behavior contract. &nbsp;Kids today hide their bullying on the anonoymous feeling interwebs. &nbsp;Never-the-less, it&#39;s nowhere as evident in the classroom as it was in the 80&#39;s.  

If my brother got in trouble, my mom didn&#39;t even want to HEAR his side, to her it didn&#39;t matter - you don&#39;t fuck with the teacher. &nbsp;Whatever the teacher says is law. &nbsp;Now.... hubby who teaches COLLEGE get&#39;s parents calling him pleading their student&#39;s cases. &nbsp;It&#39;s the opposite swing of the pendulum. &nbsp;So many of us are now parents who are frought with anxiety about being the BEST parent most loved by their children. &nbsp;I remember my grandma feeding me fish, even though I&#39;m allergic because she thought I might have outgrown it. &nbsp;Some will read that and gasp in horror, others will give a little snort. &nbsp;And that my friend is the difference between parents of my generation. &nbsp;Now I&#39;m not advocating putting your children in anaphatic shock, but that lady (my gma) grew up with 15 brothers and sisters. &nbsp;She got married and didn&#39;t tell her parents, just went on like everything was normal until they read it in the paper. &nbsp;She spent her entire &nbsp;pregnancy and gave birth to her first child all by her self while her hubby was off fixing planes in Africa during WWII. &nbsp;She was an actual Rosie the Rivitor. &nbsp;She was fire and grit and determination. &nbsp;She was intelligence beyond compare and filled with loyalty and love for her family, always seeing the good in things. &nbsp;She wasn&#39;t just a survivor, she thrived. &nbsp;She believed in the good in people. &nbsp;She grew up in a different time so it made total sense to her that I could have outgrown the allergy. &nbsp;(fyi I didn&#39;t hehe) &nbsp;But the thing is, your child didn&#39;t do shit all semester and so please stop trying to blame me and make me change the grade because your lovely child is perfect. &nbsp;Make them do their homework! &nbsp;Get on their ass! &nbsp;Take their freaking phone away. &nbsp;Spend your energy being a good parent and not a shitty one who tries to blame the teacher for &quot;not liking your kid.&quot; &nbsp;I have NEVER EVER EVER failed a kid because I didn&#39;t like them. &nbsp;Nor do I know of a teacher who has. &nbsp;Does it exist, I&#39;m sure it does somewhere. &nbsp;Just like with every job, there are good doctors and shitty doctors, but you can&#39;t assume that becuase you&#39;ve had one shitty doctor that all doctors suck. &nbsp;It&#39;s the same damn thing with teaching. &nbsp;We&#39;re doing the best we fucking can. &nbsp;We WANT your child to be successful. &nbsp;We get so freaking excited when your lovely kid does well. &nbsp;Even after they&#39;ve called us a fucking whore. &nbsp;Just like you love your child even after they say that to you. &nbsp;It&#39;s in our nature. &nbsp;Damn it to Hell I wish it wasn&#39;t, but it is. &nbsp;So please trust me, your lovely kid needs you to stop picking the breading off of every single piece of chicken nuggets EVER SINGLE TIME just to get him to eat something. &nbsp;Let him &quot;starve&quot; for dinner, let him throw that tantrum and throw his ass in his room until he decides to be human. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because we don&#39;t need a shitty generation of self-entitled, narcissictic, pseudo-adults who don&#39;t know how to be human.  

Also, my grandma died
and left me a journal of her &quot;life lessons&quot; and memories
and my car died and left me nothing
but I have a new nephew Jayden who is perfect
and I taught my other nephew Wyatt how to do some ballet
Life is funny

"event","So I just found out that I&#39;m diabetic. &nbsp;It&#39;s no surprise, looking in the mirror I know I&#39;m not &quot;me&quot;. &nbsp;I haven&#39;t been for years. &nbsp;And for years, I&#39;ve gone back and forth losing the same 10lbs, but nothing more. &nbsp;I&#39;ve known that what I eat is horrible, not so much the quantity, but the quality. &nbsp;And I&#39;ve always told myself that if I just buckled down, I&#39;d lose the weight and once (fill in the blank) is over, then I&#39;ll really hit it hard. &nbsp;Only there was always something else. &nbsp;Some other holiday or event or work stress. &nbsp;And so here i sit, fat and sick. &nbsp;My brain is telling me that this is a blessing in disguise. &nbsp;I&#39;m now forced to eat real food and take care of myself, but emotionally I&#39;m in a panic. &nbsp;I can&#39;t stop crying. &nbsp;I can&#39;t cry around my family because they&#39;re already worried and again.... my brain knows I&#39;ll be okay. &nbsp;But all of a sudden I&#39;m forced to deal with my relationship with food. &nbsp;When I was young and thin and a dancer, I ate what I wanted when I wanted and never thought twice. &nbsp;Food wasn&#39;t a source of joy or pain.... it was simply food. &nbsp;But now, I realize how much I try to get joy from food. &nbsp;How I use it as my reward for dealing with the stresses of being a HS teacher, a mother to a teenager, a wife. &nbsp;It sounds horrible, but one of my first thoughts was, &quot;how can I be happy if I can&#39;t eat anything &#39;good?&quot; &nbsp;I imagined coming home and having to prepare something that simply isn&#39;t as awesome as junky, sweet, fattening food and it overwhelmed me. &nbsp;Yet ANOTHER thing I have to worry about/do. &nbsp;For many this would make no sense. &nbsp;Even to my brain I know it&#39;s illogical, but to the emotional, irrational part of me, it strikes fear down to my core. &nbsp;Again, don&#39;t get me wrong, in the scheme of the world I know it&#39;s not a big deal, but in terms of self-reflection, it&#39;s a huge deal. &nbsp;How did I get to this point of using food as a way to feel &quot;happy&quot;? &nbsp;The change was so gradual I couldn&#39;t pinpoint its inception and I never really put a face on it until this moment. &nbsp;Tomorrow I will be fine, I&#39;ll adjust and make changes that will be better for my health. &nbsp;But right now, in this moment, I can&#39;t visualize it. &nbsp;I feel like a 2 yr old who just lost their blankie. &nbsp;And I&#39;m angry and scared, but without anyone other than myself to direct it towards. &nbsp;Which just sucks."

"event","My stupid pneumonia cough is back so I downed some cough syurp with codine in it and I feel the effects kicking in, but i'm in the mood to write after reading oodles of blogs from people who are in the process of becoming doctors. &nbsp;My two cents are to be thrown in.
Why am I reading such blogs? &nbsp;Because my district screwed me. &nbsp;Like bff says, &quot;in education you know every district will screw you, granted each will screw you in a unique way, but they will screw you none-the-less&quot; &nbsp;My district chose to do so in the form of not granting me the agreeded contract after my certification went through so I get paid as a sub instead of a teacher even though I'm doing the work of a teacher. &nbsp;

So of course I sigh and try to find out the greater lesson in it all. &nbsp;I found it ironic how i had finally come to terms with being a teacher. &nbsp;I reluctantly took the job after swearing off teaching and amazingly found that i did like teaching, i was actually good at it. &nbsp;One good thing is that it renewed my faith in both myself and my ability to be a successful teacher. &nbsp;So there I was finally at peace with that part of my life, finally saying, &quot;ya know.... I COULD do this for the rest of my life.&quot; &nbsp;Then BAM, I get screwed. &nbsp;So I'm trying to acertain what exatally I'm to do about this, what is the lesson? &nbsp;Is the universe telling me to fight to be a teacher, or is it giving me a chance to leave education without feeling like a failure. &nbsp;Then hubby pointed out that the universe was not in fact trying to get me but rather giving me multiple options all of which are &quot;right&quot; it's just a matter of what I want to choose to do. &nbsp;This got me thinking. &nbsp;What do i really WANT to do. &nbsp;Well shit, that's a hard thing to decide. &nbsp;I kept finding myself with a cup full of &quot;if's and's &amp; buts&quot; so I tried to eliminate all variables except what i actually desired to do. &nbsp;I looked at it through the lens of if $ and time weren't an issue what would I do. &nbsp;Without hesitation I knew, I'd be a doctor.

When I first started college that was my plan, but i thought I could never afford it, it took too long, and I wasn't smart enough. &nbsp;I quit. &nbsp;I went the &quot;easy&quot; route and it's always been there. &nbsp;

The thing is, I would be a kickass doctor. &nbsp;Under pressure and in &quot;gross&quot; situations i totally hold my shit together and am a calming force. &nbsp;Here's the thing too, I'm a woman who comes from a poor family. &nbsp;I know what it's like to be pushed to the sidelines. &nbsp;There this definate class distinction (usually) between physicians and patients and I want to bridge that gap. &nbsp;"

"event","&nbsp;I finally created some playlists on my iphone. &nbsp;I know I know. &nbsp;I always have a hard time making playlists, too much to choose from. &nbsp;For me it's a little like grocery shopping on an empty stomach, you come home with WAY too much food. &nbsp;I have a hard time putting my music into categories. &nbsp;So far here are my playlists: &nbsp;&quot;Emo days&quot; &nbsp;for well, all my tourtured artist stuff. &nbsp;&quot;Gimme a beat&quot; &nbsp;for my awesome 80's stuff, &quot;Rock me like a hurricane&quot; &nbsp;for my hard stuff, &quot;Sing it gurilll&quot; for my chick rock , &quot;Bunny gangstah&quot; for rap/hip-hop and &quot;Oi Oi Oi&quot; for my punk stuff. &nbsp;Oh and &quot;grandpa music&quot; for my bluegrass coolness. &nbsp;Jensen has like 5000 playlists, too intimidating for me. &nbsp;Too many decisions to make. &nbsp;I hate having too many things to choose from, sometimes it paralyses me - too many &quot;what-if's&quot; &nbsp;This is indicative of something bigger, I'm just not sure what yet.

Personal Evolution has been weighing on my mind. &nbsp;Boo's growing up. &nbsp;I know parents always say that, but she really is. &nbsp;She's going to be in jr. high next year. &nbsp;She's already off spending the night at friends and doing all sorts of wonderful things without me. &nbsp;It's such a double edged sword. &nbsp;I love that we moved out here and she took too it so well. &nbsp;She's blossomed so much, but at the same time I have to continuously confront the reality of the situation - she is growing up and on. &nbsp;I've done my job well, but I don't know how parents do it - I don't know how they watch their babies go off in a car - driving - or away to college - or off on some far away adventure. &nbsp;For so long it was just her and I. &nbsp;And even when hubby came in, i've given so much of myself to that role of &quot;mom&quot; that I forget what it was like without that. &nbsp;And now, as she's growing away on her own I'm finding that I need to re-define myself. &nbsp;Remember who I was, who I am aside from being &quot;mom.&quot; &nbsp;I have to find a way to not get depressed when she spends the night at a friends house ya know. &nbsp;It's just crazy how in truth, we need our children so much more than they need us. &nbsp;Hopefully she'll go to Berkeley or Santa Clara and not live far away :)"

"event","&nbsp;I've been rolling around this post in my head for weeks. &nbsp;More like I've been rolling around my feeling about my current job and have come up with some startling conclusions.

First a brief update. &nbsp;I swore off teaching. &nbsp;Like big time. &nbsp;I looked for teaching jobs out here in CA, but wasn't disappointed when none landed in my lap. &nbsp;Instead I ended up doing temp work as a receptionist and loved every damn minute of it. &nbsp;I was so grateful for being out of education and working elsewhere made that ever more clear. &nbsp;I could see all the faults and cracks and recite the many reasons I hated teaching, how it sucked the life out of me. &nbsp;My new job loved me. &nbsp;I was amazing and could do no wrong. &nbsp;It was so damn nice to have someone tell me I was doing a good job, to come home and have NOTHING to work on. &nbsp;Things were........ &quot;good.&quot; &nbsp;

Then I met A. at my daughters back to school night. &nbsp;Her son is in boo's class. &nbsp;A. is a VP at a middle school and we hit it off right away, 2 weeks later I find myself standing in front of a class of students. &nbsp;The one place I swore I'd never be. &nbsp;Whaaaaaaaatttt??

I now teach Environmental Science and US History to 11/12th graders and um...... I freaking like it. &nbsp;DAMN IT!! &nbsp;I'm actually not being sarcastic here for once. &nbsp;I hate teaching! &nbsp;It DOES suck the life out of you. &nbsp;The only way to really do it well is to totally throw yourself into it. &nbsp;The kids are bastards and fuck with you just because, and then think you're the greatest, and then do stupid ass shit, never-ending grading, ever changing curriculum expectations, too many kids in a class, screwy parents, not enough money, a million other things. &nbsp;Teaching is going to be the death of me. &nbsp;It's thankless and no matter what you do there's 100 more things you need to get done. &nbsp;I don't want it to be my thing. &nbsp;I want something else to be my &quot;thing.&quot; &nbsp;Something that rewards a job well done, that is logical and orderly. &nbsp;But..... it's not to be. &nbsp;Some part of me seeks out that chaos and I have to admit, not having it at the other job was freaking BOOORRRRIIINNNNGGGG!!! &nbsp;Every day was the same. &nbsp;There were no challenges, nothing pushing my creativity. &nbsp;Just day in and day out. &nbsp;I found myself getting so restless. &nbsp;At first I couldn't figure out why. &nbsp;Then it started to dawn on me, a part of me was missing teaching. &nbsp;I refused to admit it for a while. &nbsp;But the universe is unforgiving when trying to teach you a lesson and of course began to throw all sorts of educational things at me. &nbsp;

The first few days were hell and each day I was sure it was going to be my last and i wasn't going to come back. &nbsp;The kids SUCKED! &nbsp;That's another post though, but then - there was that moment when I was up there all excited because I was teaching them about state vs. federal rights and they were all in the discussion and coming up with awesome comments and questions and I was flying high. &nbsp;Now if this was a movie staring a hard nosed teacher determined to not give up on the inner city kids there would be a segway showing one of them faced with &nbsp;the opportunity to commit a drive bye or something and they'd reflect on my words of wisdom and turn away from it. &nbsp;But it's not that movie and sure enough the very next day they were bastards again. &nbsp;Kids are so fickle. &nbsp;But it reminded me of that feeling I lost for years.... that feeling you get when they're actually LISTENING to you, and you're talking about something that you feel is totally important and you're showing them WHY it's important and they GET IT! &nbsp;I have to admit, teaching elementary school did not give me many of those moments. &nbsp;In fact, it robbed me of all my self confidence. &nbsp;I still haven't sorted out how much of that came from teaching in Louisiana, and how much of it was from teaching elem. school. &nbsp;Regardless, teaching HS again is much better than elem. &nbsp;I don't want to like it, but I'm beginning to see that I will probably always crave it. &nbsp;Damn."

"event","At this moment I'm sitting at a makeshift desk surrounded by uhaul boxes and cheap plastic bins which are filled with the contents of my life. &nbsp;In 5 days said boxes will be loaded on a uhaul and we'll be on our way to our new home on the other side of the country. &nbsp;I'm awash with so many different conflicting yet equally strong feelings that I have no idea where to begin.

I've had a few &quot;major moves&quot; in my life. &nbsp;The obligitory &quot;off to college&quot; move, though major, I always knew it was temporary. &nbsp;A means to an end. &nbsp;The move back to havasu felt that way as well. &nbsp;The first BIG move was to North Carolina where I packed up what little I owned and treked into the unknown. &nbsp;BFF and I arrived at the house (which I had no idea what to expect) and both started to cry - the boy had come through and I was going to live in a decent house! &nbsp;I lived there for 4 years, 3 3/4 years longer than the relationship which led me there. &nbsp;

Next major moved happened in a whirlwind, split second decision which landed me in podunk Louisiana next door to my soon to be ex-boyfriends parents. &nbsp;That moved happened so fast that I didn't really have too much time to worry about it, and work started the next day so it was months until I was able to actually process it all. &nbsp;4 years later, husband, daughter and I are about to embark to California. &nbsp;This move is markedly different in that we both want to go, it's been planned for ages, etc etc. &nbsp;Instead of leaving an old life and beginning a new, it's more of a continuation of our family. &nbsp;It's the reaching of a goal we'd set together - which was to one day move closer to family and friends whom all live in the West. &nbsp;

Despite all this, I'm finding myself a bit scared and overwhelmed. &nbsp;What if it sucks. &nbsp;Plain and simple. &nbsp;I don't think it will, but what if it does. &nbsp;On top of that, I've been in a bit of a social isolation mood out here. &nbsp;The people are different than me, sooo different. &nbsp;I'm surrounded by people who still refer to others as &quot;he black ya know&quot; in whispered tones. &nbsp;Where to not eat crawfish with ever other meal is a bit sacraligeous. &nbsp;There's a famous book out here (forgive me if I already mentioned it) &quot;Who's your mama, are you catholic, and can you make a rou&quot; &nbsp;That's pretty much what people ask you upon meeting from one degree to another. &nbsp;Who's your kin, who do you know. &nbsp;I digress, but let's just say that this place though interesting, to me will be chalked up as a bit of a participant observation in my unwritten sociology book :) &nbsp;

It's easy to say I had few good friends out here, and while in NC, though I had more friends, it was hard to maintain them in a military town which transfered people in and out with the drop of a hat. &nbsp;Needless to say I'm going on almost 8 years without having what I would consider &quot;proper&quot; friends. &nbsp;This of course not counting friends from before the moves. &nbsp;And here I am about to enter a place where I should be able to actually make real friends and I find myself feeling a bit like a freshman about to enter high school for the first time. &nbsp;I'm a bit afraid that I'm too out of practice to make any real friends. &nbsp;Plus I'm a bit negative, and not really very cool, and oddly enough really shy. &nbsp;

I guess what I'm looking for is to round out my life. &nbsp;I'm blessed that this is the stage of my life I find myself in. &nbsp;But I am overwhelmed at the thought. &nbsp;"

"event","&nbsp;I quit my job
yep - for the first time since I was like 14 I quit a job without either moving or having a different/better job to go to. &nbsp;I'd go into the why's - but it'd take too long and I'm simply over it by now. &nbsp;Let's just say it was a bad situation and I finally stood up for myself which was SCARY AS HELL at the time, but now - I feel empowered! &nbsp;Thank god for my hubby and bff - they totally had my back. &nbsp;There's just something about your peeps being there for you that can make everything all good again. &nbsp;Through this I've realized how much I've been holding myself back. &nbsp;For example - me going back to school. &nbsp;Everyone's always told me i needed to go to grad school but I'd always come up with some excuse as to why I couldn't do it and the truth of the matter was that I was scared. &nbsp;Scared I wasn't smart enough to hack it. &nbsp;Scared that I wouldn't be able to get in or if I did I wouldn't be able to come up with something &quot;new and original.&quot; &nbsp;But it all boiled down to the same thing. &nbsp;Scared. &nbsp;It's funny, I'd go to medical school before I'd go get my ph.d in something like history or soc. &nbsp;To me that stuff is easy. &nbsp;Sure you have to memorize a lot of crap, but memorizing is a hell of a lot easier than unique abstract thinking. &nbsp;I mean, what if I couldn't come up with anything good. &nbsp;But after a lot of soul searching I finally realized that getting a ph.d was what I REALLY want to do. &nbsp;And ya know what, I might flunk out, I might reach a plateau and never overcome it, but at least I will have tried and if I don't, it's always going to hang over my head. &nbsp;I think about bella and the advice that I'd give her in the same situation &quot;go for your dreams&quot; and if I don't set that example for her, where's she gonna get it? &nbsp;Anyway, so that's the plan :)

In the mean time I've taken an awesome vacay to Oregon and had a very strange encounter with a bag full of dildo's and a crazy friend of a friend which made me appreciate the fact that I've grown up. &nbsp;It's amazing when you see people who are stuck in the same drama as they were 10 years ago and don't understand why things are the way they are. &nbsp;I just ran into that with my ex who's broken up with his latest gfriend. &nbsp;I was actually hoping that would work out for him, but sure enough - same ole same ole. &nbsp;I can pretty much say that about most of my ex's which in hindsight makes me realize that it wasn't ALL me. &nbsp;But it's interesting to look at bff and I. &nbsp;I mean, statistically we had everything going against us. &nbsp;We were the after school special that you'd watch...... uh ..... after school. &nbsp;And yet, we've both come so far. &nbsp;She's grown with every relationship and experience. &nbsp;She went for her dream and now has a MA to show for it. &nbsp;She moved to the place she always wanted to, is responsible and amazing and well, frankly turned out pretty damn well. &nbsp;I'd say the same (for the most part) about myself. &nbsp;Yet we both had to put up with crazy alcoholics, abuse, poverty - you name it. &nbsp;But I look at my ex and the friend of a friend - both come from normal, loving middle class families and yet they can't seem to escape their own dysfunctions. &nbsp;I'm sounding judgemental and I don't want to. &nbsp;Instead what I took from it all was a sense of gratefullness about my own life. &nbsp;I believe that a lot of it was luck. &nbsp;I couldn't tell you why I'm where I am. &nbsp;I never thought I would be. &nbsp;To ramble on even more about this, my mom complimented me yesterday about what a good parent I was (which was funny to me cuz bella was being a brat). &nbsp;I just didn't know what to say to it - I've talked about this before - there was little &quot;planning&quot; that went into the raising of my daughter, it was more a feeling of survival, and yet......she rocks. &nbsp;Again, I'm grateful as hell.

But back to portland - bff's friends are amazing! &nbsp;We had so much fun, but to me one of the highlights was Powell's books! &nbsp;OMG I could live there! &nbsp;We spent 4 hrs. there and I feel like I barely scratched the surface. &nbsp;After checking out about 25lbs of books I realized I bought the majority for bella hahaha. &nbsp;But she's in heaven! &nbsp;Her big thing is historical fiction so I got her all sortsa books in that genre. &nbsp;I love that she's a reader! &nbsp;Spending time with bff was just amazing. &nbsp;I have to live close to her. &nbsp;She's such a part of me. &nbsp;I truly believe that few people have the type of friendship that we have. &nbsp;I was awesome telling stories of us growing up. &nbsp;We realized that at one time or another we each saved each other. &nbsp;I've known her for 20 years now. &nbsp;Crazy huh! &nbsp;No matter where we are or what we're going through - it seems like not a day has passed since we last saw each other. &nbsp;I'm totally looking forward to living within driving distance of her.

And now my folks are out for a visit. &nbsp;We're doing all the touristie things and having a blast. &nbsp;I actually went &quot;antiquing&quot; today. &nbsp;Never done that before. &nbsp;Well, unless you count thrift stores :) &nbsp;I had SO MUCH FUN!! &nbsp;I never knew I'd like that! &nbsp;It makes sense though, the history nut in me. &nbsp;It was a bummer though because I couldn't justify getting anything since we're moving soon. &nbsp;But I'm definatly going to drag Jensen to that :) &nbsp;

So I have about a week left of &quot;vacation&quot; and then it's nose to the grindstone to get things together for the move - mainly a job! &nbsp;I've realized I just don't want to teach for a while so I think I'm going to be looking for something else. &nbsp;I don't think people realize how degrading teaching can be. &nbsp;Not always, I mean I've been in situations where it wasn't, but people are so critical, administration is so critical, and the public in general. &nbsp;It's always about what you're not doing or how you're doing it wrong, yet no one will tell you a &quot;right&quot; way to do things. &nbsp;There's a million different teaching philosophies and so many of them conflict. &nbsp;You're told that EVERY CHILD must pass a test, but they won't tell you what's on the test, but if EVERY KID doesn't not just pass, but do exceptionally well then you must be doing something wrong. &nbsp;No one tells a dr. that EVERY PATIENT must survive cancer and if they don't the dr. is doing something wrong. &nbsp;It's sad, but you can always recognize a teacher by their haggard look and teacher clothes. &nbsp;Every teacher I know has put on weight, has health problems and is just generally a stressed out nightmare. &nbsp;That just shouldn't happen. &nbsp;Teachers should be respected and honored. &nbsp;You may deal with your one crazy child, they deal with 30 - all day long. &nbsp;And I LOVE my kid, she's an amazing child, but all day 30 of them, they have enough to deal with with that alone, but then you add everything else on top of it and it's no wonder they're haggard and exhausted. &nbsp;No matter how much you love your job, when it beats the hell out of you day in and day out you begin to wonder. &nbsp;Teachers rarely stick up for themselves either. &nbsp;We're &quot;in it for the kids&quot; so we put up with all the other crap because we think we have to. &nbsp;We lose our voice and allow ourselves to be treated poorly because often we don't know any better and if we do, we feel that our one voice won't make a difference. &nbsp;There's an established hierarchy of power that exists in education that's so difficult to change. &nbsp;Everyone's afraid .... afraid a parent will complain, afraid test scores will suck, afraid that they'll be laid off as so many teachers are, afraid if they complain they'll be put in a worse situation, given more students in a class, forced to teach something you don't want. &nbsp;So instead we bite our tongues and bide our time hoping that we'll be able to get the smaller class, teaching the content we want, making the parents happy enough that they don't pick apart everything you do. &nbsp;It's a shame because in the end things become so watered down that kids aren't benefitting at all. &nbsp;I would say it's much better at a high school level, but it does still exist there. &nbsp;

Wow, that was cathartic :)"

"event","&nbsp;I'm bored. &nbsp;I hate to say that since I don't have to work due to my inability to safely roll a cart with a tv, but I have to admit... I'm bored. &nbsp;If I had some decent drugs it might make my time off rather interesting, but sadly, nothing more than hyped up asprin. &nbsp;So what have I been doing you might ask..... playing a whole lot of free cell, reading blog posts from my friend written by her &quot;cat&quot; who's a Canadian transplant, and watching a shit load of HGTV and DIY network. &nbsp;Normally that would be awesome, but it makes me want to build things which is sorta a problem since 1) I'm a gimp at the moment and 2) I don't have any tools. &nbsp;But ohhh do I have plans hahaha. &nbsp;I've already made my Christmas list:
1) nail gun - that's just GOT to be fun to use!! &nbsp;Hell I think I could build an entire house with just a nail gun and some tunes. &nbsp;
2) jig saw - every show I watch they need a jig saw somehow somewhere.
3) &nbsp;wood glue - why, because with wood glue you can fix anything, it's the equivalent of duct tape it seems
4) a house in which to do all of my projects

So then of course I begin thinking about how cool it'd be to become a contractor. &nbsp;Granted I hate mornings, and am a bit of a wimp physically, but in my mind that wouldn't be a problem. &nbsp;I'd be this super talented chica who could fix anything. &nbsp;An then I dream about going back to school to &quot;learn the trade&quot; &nbsp;which ones? &nbsp;all of them. &nbsp;Except I'm not really sure where one would go to learn things. &nbsp;I mean is there like an &quot;intro to construction&quot; class? &nbsp;I'd need something basic ie: &nbsp;this is a hammer and the differences between flathead and phillips head screwdrivers. &nbsp;It's funny, I grew up around construction but never seemed to learn much - though I can tile like a mofo. &nbsp;My grandpa was a builder and even to this day at the ripe ole age of 85 he helps family members do additions and build homes etc. &nbsp;My mom continued on in an unofficial mannor, usually involving weekend projects that required us to get up at some ungodly hr. &nbsp;Our house is rather impressive now - all done by her and the family. &nbsp;I really think i'd like to take a class to learn more, just not sure where to start. &nbsp;Plus not having a home of my own to work on sorta takes all the fun out of it.

This time off has given me the luxury of daydreaming again though and that's rather nice. &nbsp;It seems like the latest thing, coming up with some list of things you want to do before you die - so I've been mentally creating some of my own. &nbsp;See hubby should be done with his ph.d. in about a year and our deal is when he's done and teaching somewhere I get to go back to school. &nbsp;I have to say, the though both excites and scares the hell out of me. &nbsp;It's like I have a chance of a do-over and that's sooooo rare to have. &nbsp;I never thought I'd be in that position. &nbsp;Before the thoughts of going back to school entailed figuring out how to support myself AND mini-me while going to school. &nbsp;No easy task I assure you, but now, that's a real possibility and I don't want to waste it! &nbsp;I never went into medicine because I thought I wasn't smart enough, I'm still not too sure I am, but maybe I should just try? &nbsp;I don't know. &nbsp;I don't want to let anyone down ya know. &nbsp;All I know is that I want out of education. &nbsp;Sure, I can do it till retirement, but i just ....... it just literally sucks the life out of you. &nbsp;I want to help people, I'm all idealistic and crap where I want my life to somehow contribute to some cosmic greater good, but I know that every career has its down sides and I want to find one that I enjoy going to every day. &nbsp;One where I can see my &quot;work&quot; if that makes sense. &nbsp;Maybe building things would be a good path. &nbsp;And then this other side of me thinks about finding a job where I put in my 8hrs. a day, go home and not have to think about it again till the next day. &nbsp;That's what I loved about being a secretary - it was easy for me, I'm an organizational bitch! &nbsp;Maybe I should go into human resources or something and get an office job where I don't have to worry about anything. &nbsp;But would that be giving up somehow? &nbsp;Then I think of dentistry - please refrain from laughing! &nbsp;It's in the medical field, but doesn't require 10 years of schooling. &nbsp;Hmmm decisions decisions.

Other things on my list: &nbsp;
-do the &quot;3 days for a cure&quot; breast cancer walk
-travel to another country
-volunteer
-make my own furniture
I'm sure there's more, but my foot is throbbing and it's a bitch to type and elevate at the same time.

"event","&nbsp;So yesterday at work I somehow managed to drop a tv on my foot. &nbsp;I'm really not exactally sure how I did it, I think it caught on the door frame, but to be honest with you, one moment I was pulling it on the cart and the next moment I was sitting on it holding my foot thinking, &quot;fuck fuck fuck&quot; and &quot;owwwwww&quot;. &nbsp;I'm all cold yet sweaty at the same time and feel like i'm going to vomit. &nbsp;My next thought was &quot;what to do&quot;, do I shake it off, not sure I could and then when I tried to step on it I realized i couldn't. &nbsp;So I decide to hop to the next classroom. &nbsp;In order to do so I had to push the tv out of the way since it was in the doorway. &nbsp;Long story short, I ended up getting yelled at because I moved the tv and so R. my sorta boss who happened at my school couldn't &quot;reconstruct&quot; what happened. &nbsp;Even though he just happened to be there and it's nowhere in his job description - i mean he fixes computers - he was there for our printer?? wtf - but he's a rather arrogent kinda guy who likes to think that he's far superior to everyone. &nbsp;So he starts grilling me which on one hand I'd totally understand it if it was the principal, trying to find out what was going on - but she was rather cool about it. &nbsp;It was that it was him and he doesn't even work there and I was cranky and in pain. &nbsp;My first thought was not liability but rather, &quot;ouch ouch ouch.&quot; &nbsp;I was so pissed. &nbsp;Here I was in &nbsp;a shit load of pain but trying to be all cool and not cry or anything and he's like, &quot;so what angle do you think you were coming through the door at&quot; &nbsp;Finally one of the teachers was like, &quot;dude... you're not sherlock holmes, let her go the the hospital&quot; &nbsp;hehehe Kelly freaking rocks. &nbsp;I realize this is all jumbly, but that's what vicoden will do to you. &nbsp;I'm soooo not looking foreward to working tomorrow with the boot on. &nbsp;It totally hurts my hip having to walk all crazy. &nbsp;Sigh."

"event","&nbsp;So I thought I'd be all bad ass and work out today. &nbsp;Yeah I know, what was I thinking. &nbsp;Here's the scene: &nbsp;Me in my &quot;livingroom/kitchen/super cramped area&quot; &nbsp;filled with parts of bella's social studies project remains. &nbsp;I fire up the wii and put in my new biggest loser game. &nbsp;I'm all pumped up. &nbsp;I step on the balance board to calculate my weight - oh wait, i should take off my shoes and jacket so it'll be accurate.... gulp, that can't be right.....184 holy crap. &nbsp;Okay, okay, not a problem, I mean i AM working out so it'll go down right? &nbsp;Sigh. &nbsp;Focus nikki, focus. &nbsp;Alright, I do one of the challenges to see where I'm at. &nbsp;I choose what I think will be a decent challenge and get going. &nbsp;5 minutes of a football run, that shouldn't be too bad. &nbsp;OMG IT WAS SOOOO TO BAD!! &nbsp;But wait, it didn't stop there, that was just round ONE!! &nbsp;Hmmm, I wonder how many rounds there are, it doesn't say, but I can't stop now cuz if I do it'll mess up my score. &nbsp;So I start the second round, damn my remote just fell out of my pockets. &nbsp;Okay, I'll take a quick break and change into better pants.... now back for round 3. &nbsp;Ohhh, I'm tired - maybe this is the last round. &nbsp;I sit down and rest, but it's starting again so instead of running I just wiggle the remote - but I gotta wiggle it really really fast which is tiring in itself but it must be over soon right? &nbsp;And how come I'm still in 5th place with cheating?!! &nbsp;Okay, round 4 (continue wiggling)..... skip ahead to the final round ROUND 8!!!!! &nbsp;and I'm exhausted and all I did was sit and shake the remote up and down really fast so it thought I was running. &nbsp;UGGGGHHHHH!!! &nbsp;I get tired cheating at wii exercise. &nbsp;That's definatly NOT a good sign, but in all fairness, moving your arms up and down really fast for 40 minutes should count for exercise I think :)

I rested some more and did some super light yoga with the game. &nbsp;And now I'm sore. &nbsp;This is going to be a loooonnnngggg journey. &nbsp;

For some reason I've always wanted to be a runner. &nbsp;Which is weird since i really hate to run. &nbsp;Tomorrow I start my &quot;couch to 5k&quot; program which claims to get non-runners to the point of being able to run a 5k. &nbsp;It alternates with walking and jogging starting out really slow. &nbsp;walk for 90 sec. run for 60 etc. etc. for a total of 20 minutes. &nbsp;I wasn't scared at first, but after my wii fiasco I'm afraid someone will find me on the side of the road dead from a heart attack after 10 sec. of jogging. &nbsp;If anyone can die from running it will be me. &nbsp;

Friday we had a snow day. &nbsp;Here in Louisiana. &nbsp;I couldn't believe it! &nbsp;Especially when it didn't actually snow. &nbsp;Then tonight I found out that school is also closed monday due to low water pressure. &nbsp;I actually found this out by accident on facebook. &nbsp;Crazy how the world works. &nbsp;See I always forget to charge my phone so it's in the depths of my purse, silent and dead hence I didn't get a phone call from the parish. &nbsp;Well, I did, but I didn't hear it. &nbsp;Anyway, put bella to be and was messing around on fb and I see that one of my coworkers posts there's no school tomorrow so I check it out and sure enough, no school. &nbsp;The parish is &quot;running low&quot; on water and so the water will be turned off tonight at 10pm. &nbsp;But no one knows when it'll be turned back on. &nbsp;No water = no school. &nbsp;Now, the no school part is great, but the no water part sucks. &nbsp;I'm not sure why we're low since we've had so much rain it's been flooding like crazy here. &nbsp;Not to mention we're right along the mississippi. &nbsp;There's no mention if something's broken and they've got to turn off the water to fix it or what the deal is, but no one in the whole parish will have water as of 10pm tonight. &nbsp;Oh the joys of living in backwoods LA."

"event","&nbsp;So tonight bella is at a hornet's game with jensen. &nbsp;She was able to get cheap tickets cuz she's in 4-H and they had some sorta special thing. &nbsp;Jensen being a basketball fan he was stoked as was bella. &nbsp;I on the other hand wasn't looking foreward to spending a night after work in a loud stadium blah blah so i decided it was to be &quot;their&quot; night (when in reality it was a &quot;mom is free from everyone&quot; night). &nbsp;I love my family deeply, but oh how I'm loving tonight. &nbsp;I went and did the girlie mani-pedi, caught up on Lost and talked with my best bud for hrs. &nbsp;Which is sorta where this post is coming from. &nbsp;

It's odd when you get old. &nbsp;I'm reflecting on all the random tangents our conversation took and how in so many ways though we're talking about the economy and the state of education today we're still talking about the same things that we did 20 years ago..... people who suck, yearning to find people who don't suck, relationships, where we're living and where we want to go, boys and pets (no, not that the boys are our pets but they both came up in the same conversation haha). &nbsp;Even now we &quot;talk&quot; like we did in H.S. in that we can finish each others sentences and jump from one topic to the other in some sort of seamless dance. &nbsp;We'd get teased about how we talked. &nbsp;Here's an example:
Me: &quot;omg did you hear&quot;
Her: &nbsp;&quot;yeah I know!&quot;
Me: &nbsp;&quot;it's like that thing&quot;
Her: &nbsp;&quot;totally, and then it's like&quot;
Me: &nbsp;&quot;I KNOW! &nbsp;why is that&quot;
Her: &quot;totally&quot;
and that would litterally be our conversation, the thing is .... we knew exactally what the other was talking about and were able to interpert it and analyze it the same way...without word. &nbsp;I can't remember who it was, but one of our classmates said it was like we read each others mind. &nbsp;We still do that even now.

I love my best friend. &nbsp;No matter where we are, we're going through the same thing. &nbsp;We get each other. &nbsp;You know those friends you have who have your back first and ask questions later.... that's her. &nbsp;If someone needed to be offed, she'd do it. &nbsp;Okay, not really but it's one of those things where the bond is there that even if the friend is wrong, they're your friend first. &nbsp;I'm not sure if I'm making sense. &nbsp;We're the ying to the others yang. &nbsp;I'm a hypochondriac, she's deathly afraid of doctors. &nbsp;I'm an organization freak, she's.... um.... not haha. &nbsp;When she's down and avoiding phone calls I know how to drag her out to be social. &nbsp;When&nbsp;i'm going through craziness in my life she knows how to calm me down. &nbsp;We bitch about our parents, siblings, ex's, currents, together and it's all good. &nbsp;She remembers things for me and I find things for her. &nbsp;I miss her. &nbsp;I miss living in the same town as her sooo much. &nbsp;

It just gets me thinking about how important those friendships are. &nbsp;How rare they are and how grateful I am to have her in my life. &nbsp;I think some people go through life without having that. &nbsp;In more ways than one I think we've saved each others lives, and in more ways than one I think we've added a spark to each others lives. &nbsp;And for that, I'm eternally grateful. &nbsp;And someday, we will fly off to Europe on a whim, and as soon as she starts that writing commune in Mexico I'll be the first in line....even though I don't write haha

Here's to good friends"

"event","<p>Tonight bella said I was a ""supermom""&nbsp; it made me smile :)&nbsp; It's so hard for me to give myself any credit when it comes to raising her, like I said before.... she just sorta turned out the way she is - i'm not exactally sure how but i never gave it much thought - raising her that is.&nbsp; What I mean by that is there are many a parent out there that gives raising their kids THOUGHT.&nbsp; Most everything they do is a conscious effort.&nbsp; They analyze the overall GOOD of allowing their child to read a certain book or watch a program.&nbsp; They make sure to have them involved in the RIGHT activities.&nbsp; They play classical music while their child is in the womb.&nbsp; They make sure that veggies are eaten and that dinner is had at a table and at a set time.&nbsp; They spend money on baby einstein stuff and plan ""craft time"" with the kids and all that junk.&nbsp; They debate on the proper phrasing of things making sure to correct in a positive ""It would be a better choice to share with your brother instead of hitting him with your toy""&nbsp; rather than the ""what the hell is wrong with you stop hitting your brother in the head with your toy.""&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;Don't get me wrong, I'm not bagging on that.&nbsp; I wanted to be that parent, it just didn't turn out that way.&nbsp; I tell my child she's annoying me.&nbsp; She lives on microwavable food, and as long as she's not bugging me I don't care what she watches.&nbsp; I will admit to playing classical music to her as a baby when she went to sleep.&nbsp; Maybe that was the thing which made her how she is now hahaha.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;It's just being a mom is tiring business.&nbsp; They talk to you ALL THE TIME.&nbsp; You rarely get to pee without having a voice on the other side of the door asking you for something.&nbsp; They argue over if they should be allowed to dye their hair and if so at what age.&nbsp; No matter what age you say, they've got to try to negotiate down to something younger.&nbsp; Everything is ""why...why... or why not...""&nbsp; Then you have to feed them.&nbsp; And you should probablly let them do things like play and do stuff like gymnastics or soccer or whatever all of which require time taking them here or there.&nbsp; Tiring.&nbsp; And then there's the homework.&nbsp; Lord help me.&nbsp; Last minute projects where you have to run to the store and get eggs to hardboil so they can compare it to regular eggs.&nbsp; At 8pm at night.&nbsp; Oh yeah, don't forget to get cookies and candy for the party on thursday.&nbsp; Oh and while your at it i need to buy a shirt for the mini-olympics at school so i'm not the only one wearing the uniform.&nbsp; oh and watch me do a one handed cartwheel....wait, that wasn't good, let me do another.....hang on one more........&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;Yes yes yes I'm off on a total tangent that makes sense only in the world of Nikki.&nbsp; But see, that's what I mean, that's my daily life - lost on a rollercoaster of exhaustion in which i'm so busy trying to survive the moment that I don't have time to give THOUGHT to how i'm raising her.&nbsp; Instead I'm just trying to get her to go to bed at a decent hr.&nbsp; People tell me I'm a great parent and I just don't see it.&nbsp; Instead I see that I have an amazing kid.&nbsp; An annoying, talkative, argumentative, too smart for her own good kid.&nbsp; And I love everything about her.&nbsp; That's what makes it worth it.&nbsp; It's not to be called a super mom.&nbsp; It's because even though she wears me out on a daily basis, she's the coolest person I've ever met.&nbsp; She lights the world on fire and I'm happy just to know her.&nbsp; So when she called me supermom tonight........ it was the best compliment I've ever recieved.&nbsp; </p>"

"event","I called in sick today because, well I'm sick.&nbsp; Normally I hate wasting sick&nbsp;days when I'm ill because what's the fun of staying home if you can't actually ENJOY it.&nbsp; But having fought this cold for what feels like months I finally broke down and allowed myself to sleep until bella came home at 3:30.&nbsp; The drawback is that it's now 11:30pm and I have to go to work tomorrow buy my brain/body thinks it's wakie time.&nbsp; So I'm left with the inability to sleep and random thoughts roaming my brain.

We're going to get married on a yacht off of Newport Beach most likely.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;funny, I was never one of those girls that ""played married"" or planned out her wedding by the ripe age of 9.&nbsp; The first marriage was meant to be cliche hence the drive thru&nbsp;wedding chapple in Vegas.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Johnny talked marriage I was excited, but couldn't conceptualize it probably because somewhere in the back of my brain I knew that things&nbsp;just weren't right, but oh did I fight that one for a few years.&nbsp; Fast foreward to now.&nbsp; We knew we wanted to get married out west since both of our families were from that area.&nbsp; We both knew we wanted an outside wedding as well and that was about as far as I got.

To me, most weddings suck&nbsp;considering the amount of money people put into them.&nbsp; There's always the fake fancy food and matching chair covers and useless party favors on the table.&nbsp; A pretend paparazzi floating about hoping to take the perfect pics.&nbsp; The ceremony is usually no better.&nbsp; Alright, we all sit there and wait till the bride comes down the isle.&nbsp; Usually you can't here what the guys's saying but there are a few i do's and it's off to the previously mentioned party.&nbsp; There are flowers that will&nbsp;soon die&nbsp;decorating every possible place and the colors are always something bland.&nbsp; People don't start dancing until they're drunk and you're filled in a room that is composed of mostly strangers and relatives that no one has seen in years but are somehow obligated to come.&nbsp; This is through the eyes of&nbsp; the average guest.&nbsp; And to think that they spent $150 per person for this event.&nbsp; I know I know, the people in the wedding, those who are celebrating their new lives are loving every minute of it and truely that's what's important.&nbsp; But often I wonder how much of the&nbsp;wedding comes from our complete socialization into how a wedding is SUPPOSE to be.&nbsp; There's an&nbsp;entire industry dedicated to showing you how you should do your wedding.&nbsp; And I wonder how many people would enjoy going to their own wedding if they were merely a guest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

My first concern in planning my wedding was the reception site because i don't care how many flowers and sashes you put around something if the place has a dorky moose head hanging from&nbsp;the wall it's just not going to work.&nbsp; I love 2 things aesthetically, color and nature.&nbsp; Color as in Picasso's Woman in Front of&nbsp;A Mirror and nature as in well.........nature.&nbsp; It's hard to really have either of those two things at a reception short of cover the walls of a reception hall in lots of fabric and, well,&nbsp;most places don't seem to be fly with that.&nbsp; And then there's the question of flowers, what to put where without spending a million dollars.&nbsp; Does anyone have any IDEA how much it costs to have flowers everywhere for a wedding........flowers, the ones that are going to die in a week, the thing that I never have around my house at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So it becomes overwhelming because you begin to feel like you've got to conform to some sorta mold.&nbsp; It's like when you're pregnant and strangers come up to you in the store and touch your belly and tell you&nbsp;techniques on brest-feeding.&nbsp; Except now they touch the ring and tell you the name of a good photographer.&nbsp; And you begin to think if people would talk if you chose fake flowers, if there'd be a scandal at the water cooler if you decided to not put foil embossment on your wedding invitations.&nbsp; It's retarded because everyone gets sucked into it.&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the end they all look the same!&nbsp; After&nbsp;untold hours of the bride agonizing over which shade of green to include in the place settings ..........it still looks the same as every other wedding.&nbsp; All that stress, all the arguments the couple probablly had&nbsp;over who to sit where, was really all for naught.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I know this, and yet I'm about to embark upon the hellish journey of becoming ""one of them.""&nbsp; So I'm trying to not fall into that wedding planning trap of insanity.&nbsp; I want something that's fun and something that's us.&nbsp; Screw place cards people sit where you want.&nbsp; Decorations, we're on a freaking boat, look outside :)&nbsp; Food, serve yourself but before you do, let's load up on the drinks and turn the music up.&nbsp; That's my idea of a good time.&nbsp; Oh and the yacht has a poker table - I don't play poker, but I would at my wedding.&nbsp; Hell I'd be the freaking dealer - just give me one of those hats.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; because it looks like fun and I've never been to a wedding where people played poker.&nbsp; And I was thinking on the 3rd deck of having a kids room with cool games and such for them to play with.&nbsp; That way the parents could have fun as well as the kids.&nbsp; I always hated being a kid at a wedding.&nbsp; I had to get all dressed up and couldn't have any fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I'll even rent a salsa dancer to give us all lessons, that would be fun for me hehehe.&nbsp; I've always wanted to learn to salsa dance and it'd get people up off their chairs.&nbsp; So I'm open to ideas and suggestions.&nbsp; Things you've always wanted to see at a wedding or ways to&nbsp;make a wedding better.&nbsp; I'm set on the yacht though :)&nbsp;It can hold up to 150 people and has 3 stories.&nbsp; It'll be in the summer, sunset,&nbsp;trolling alongside the beach.

let's get this party started :)&nbsp;"

"event","Today Bella had her 1st soccer game.&nbsp; She hadn't practiced with the team because their only practice was during my birthday party so we didn't really know what to expect.&nbsp; The last two years she played she was on a co-ed team, but now that she moved up in age group she's now on an all girls team.&nbsp; They're freaking HILARIOUS!!&nbsp; OMG her goalie does this cool little dance of glory when she catches the ball - totally reminds me of bella.&nbsp; They're probablly the worst soccer team I've EVER seen but she had a total blast hahahaha.&nbsp; And she's actually the star player which just cracks me up.&nbsp; It was awesome.<br /><br />Jensen came to the game.&nbsp; I've noticed something when I'm with him, people of other races are.......different.&nbsp; We were sitting there and there was this black couple next to us and they were all super chatty and joking around with us.&nbsp; If it was just me, that wouldn't have happened.&nbsp; Things like that happen everywhere.&nbsp; At first I thought it was because he's just one of those really nice guys that says hi to people and such, but then I realized I was getting a small glimpse into another world that I don't see being white.&nbsp; That uncertainty of race relations that exist still to the day.&nbsp; Especially here in the south.&nbsp; Kate wrote a great piece about being in NC and how the neighbor kids said she wasn't like other white people because she laughs a lot.&nbsp; It's late at night so this isn't all coming out right and coherent so forgive my writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh and I've been drinking.<br /><br />Growing up in AZ we had Tyrone, THE black kid who had the misfortune of having a ""black"" name to add to the fact that he was THE black kid.&nbsp; Asian, the closest thing we had at that time was Jenny Jeung but she wasn't asian, just had an asian last name.&nbsp; Latino, well yeah, but that was so common I guess I didn't really see latino's as another ""race"".&nbsp; Then I moved to NC and at first I was just amazed, watching in awe how there were black people here........wow.........awesome!&nbsp; I'll never forget at one of the first faculty meetings the eng. teacher was telling us about something and to see her if we had any questions.&nbsp; Her last name was the same as another teacher so she said, ""I'm the light skin black, she's the dark skin one.""&nbsp; and I almost fell out my seat.........she called HERSELF a label based on race........ I thought you weren't suppose to do that - I thought we were to be color blind and never refer to people by the color of their skin.&nbsp; Living in AZ does that to you.&nbsp; It's hard to explain.&nbsp; But sure enough, as I spent more time there I realized that race wasn't seen as a deurogatory thing - to define someone by their race.&nbsp; It's funny, when I go back to AZ now I feel like I need sunglasses, everyone's so white.... and it's so weird to see that.&nbsp; So abnormal.&nbsp; I love living out this way because of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The south is weird when it comes to race.&nbsp; It's not the lynching stereotype that you'd think.&nbsp; AZ was FAR FAR FAR more racists than out here for sure.&nbsp; But there's still that weird history that comes with it.&nbsp; Some sort of unwritten rules that I haven't had the chance to read the maual on yet.&nbsp; So sitting at a soccer game, having this couple chat up with us wasn't common.&nbsp; And it all fell together.&nbsp; Jensen is Korean - they see that he's a minority too and there's some sort of comoratery in that.&nbsp; <br /><br /><img alt=""soccer chick"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v230/ninja_nikki/l_7c5e7d692b74cc8a23f6ce1b3ce94eb1.jpg"" /><br />Something that relaxes other minorities enough that conversations flow easily.&nbsp; It was awesome.&nbsp; No matter how I try to understand, I'm not a minority and as such I'm aproached with hesitation until it can be decided how I am.&nbsp; Hundreds of years of slavery, segregation, and racism setting up certain rules and procedures on interaction.&nbsp; I didn't really notice that until today.&nbsp; It was interesting.&nbsp; I'd write more about that, but my brain really isn't working right now.&nbsp; So instead of writing I'll just put another picture.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v230/ninja_nikki/015.jpg"" /><br /><br />&nbsp;"

"event","<p>I love Louisiana.&nbsp; I love where I live - 1/2 hr. from Baton Rouge one way and 1/2 hr from New Orleans the other.&nbsp; Two totally different cities but both indescribably cool.<br /><br />I've been going to LA for 3 yrs. now - each time spending time in both cities.&nbsp; I love NO so much.&nbsp; I can't describe the intense flavors of culture there.&nbsp; It's always been a unique city - politically and socially.&nbsp; It's unlike any city I've been to.&nbsp; I loved spending time down there not just in the French Qtr., but everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />And then Katrina hit.&nbsp; I cried my eyes out watching what happened the days after the hurricane.&nbsp; Watching a mother with a baby who's dying of dehydration.&nbsp; The disbelief.&nbsp; It angered me so deeply how the poor were simply left to die almost.&nbsp; Hearing people bitch about how these people should've just left blah blah which anyone with a brain knows that's just bullshit.&nbsp; The sociological commentary afterwards sums it up - my feelings aren't unique about this so I won't bother reiterating what so many others have said.<br /><br />But what angers me more is the aftermath.&nbsp; It broke my heart to see it.&nbsp; Such beauty destroyed.&nbsp; Even today it looks like a war zone. I've never in my life seen anything like it.&nbsp; Streets and streets of gutted houses.&nbsp; Abandoned buildings which have now been overtaken by those who've been left homeless as a result.&nbsp; I can't even describe it.&nbsp; What's worse is every night watching the news - the violence - the looting still goes on every day.&nbsp; So many people are dying there - killing each other.&nbsp; People are having a hell of a time re-building because of looting.&nbsp; And then the world becomes crazy to me.&nbsp; The self-destructiveness of it all.&nbsp; Instead of tragedy bringing people closer it's turned everyone against each other.&nbsp; There are no jobs.&nbsp; There are no houses for those displaced.&nbsp; There is little that people can do to pull themselves outta their desperation.&nbsp; Few hospitals, schools are extremely overcrowed since a lot of them haven't opened yet.&nbsp; Businesses aren't coming back.&nbsp; Insurance is through the roof.&nbsp; Prices are insane.&nbsp; People have given up.&nbsp; And it leaves me so.........upset/sad.&nbsp; Still neglected.&nbsp; Still left to die in a sense.&nbsp; Those with money can and did leave.&nbsp; And I wonder what's going to happen to this beautiful, unique city.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Where did this come from?&nbsp; I was sitting outside reading and I saw a storm come rolling in.&nbsp; You could smell it in the air.&nbsp; Us desert rats have an uncanny ability to smell the rain long before it arrives, perhaps because rain was such a luxury out there.&nbsp; I remember as a child sitting outside during monsoon season.&nbsp; Feeling the electricity in the air.&nbsp; The hot rain as it poured down in big droplets.&nbsp; Crazy wind.&nbsp; I felt myself wrapped around the storm and for some reason it was so..........comforting.<br /><br />But after living here even the little bit I have, storms have become......different.&nbsp; Ominous as the winds begin to blow through the trees.&nbsp; Angry nature.&nbsp; Not that I'm afraid of a hurricane or anything like that,&nbsp; but ........it's different now and I wonder if I'll ever feel that awe of an oncoming storm like I use to.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I miss the desert storms.&nbsp; That celebration of much needed rain.&nbsp; The beauty of it whirling around you.<br /></p>"

"event","KT wrote a piece in which I was in it.&nbsp; It dealt with the chaos that was the birth of mini-me.&nbsp; It was beautiful.&nbsp; At the end there was a comment about how despite our collective fucked up upbringings that mini-me was going to know she was loved.&nbsp; No matter what.

Tonight she and I had movie night.&nbsp; Godbless vacations, I find I actually have time to enjoy things such as movie night :)&nbsp; So we got in our pj's, climbed into my bed and ate endless amounts of popcorn while watching movies.&nbsp; It was a perfect moment.&nbsp; Her and I chatting, cuddling, laughing all of that good stuff.&nbsp; Perfect.&nbsp; And when she fell asleep I just sat looking at her and I realized something amazing.&nbsp; She knows she's loved.&nbsp; I've succeeded somehow, some way.&nbsp; She knows.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I was reminded of moments growing up.&nbsp; My mom is an amazing lady.&nbsp; She pulled us outta hell through sheer might.&nbsp; She beat the odds and because of that I'm here and the person that I am today.&nbsp; But unfortunatlly that came at a cost.&nbsp; She was so busy keeping us safe, putting food on our table etc. that she had so little left.&nbsp; And I think a part of her feared that if she relaxed a bit, if she showed emotion she'd crack and not be able to save us from another statistic.&nbsp; I remember the nightmares, some of which still haunt me when I close my eyes.&nbsp; Hell, my life was a nightmare, but it was the worst at night.&nbsp; All I wanted was my mom's arms around me, hugs, reassuring words that only a mother can give in times like that (note:&nbsp; a father can do this as well of course, but there wasn't one able to do that for me).&nbsp; But I never got those hugs or words.&nbsp; When the nightmares were especially bad I'd BEG to sleep in her bed to no avail, so back to my prison I went.&nbsp; I don't hold it against her, she did what she needed to do to survive and I truely believe without that armor of steel she was encased with we wouldn't have survived.&nbsp; But it made it tough to love so to speak.&nbsp; To hug, for sooooooooooo long it was offensive to me in a way to be hugged.&nbsp; Awkward.&nbsp;&nbsp;

And then came mini-me.&nbsp; And I couldn't help but hug her and hold her tight.&nbsp; If there was one thing I wanted it was for her to know she's loved.&nbsp; To feel safe, to be able to have me, to have my heart and know that she was the most important thing in the world to me.&nbsp; Tonight I saw that she knew.&nbsp; That I was successful.&nbsp; And I felt blessed beyond belief.

A few weeks ago she came home and told me about her friend Brianna.&nbsp; She was shocked because Brianna said she hated her life.&nbsp; Bella just couldn't comprehend that concept..........hating one's life.&nbsp; I wanted to cry - I remember being her age and wishing that my nightmare was over even if it meant death.&nbsp; And yet here was mini-me telling me how she felt so bad for Brianna.&nbsp; Bella tells me how much she loves her life.&nbsp; All the people that love her - she felt fortunate.&nbsp; She tells me that I'm the best mom that ever lived.&nbsp; That she knows I love her more than anything in the world.&nbsp; I almost cried.&nbsp; The next day she told me she talked to Brianna and she thinks she cheered her up.&nbsp; She told Brianna how Johnny had been in the hospital a few times and how much it scared her and that it was okay to be scared and if she ever wanted a hug, she was there to give her a hug.&nbsp; Bella's 7 years old.&nbsp; I don't know how she turned out so amazing.&nbsp; I'm in constant awe of her capacity to love life and care so much about others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

So here I sit with mini-me crashed in my bed and I can't help but feel like the luckiest human being in the history of the world"

"event","For the last yr. my life has been unusual, uncommon, unpredictable.&nbsp; It's hard to explain.&nbsp; Especially lately.&nbsp; I feel as though I've lost my creativity somewhere along the lines and I don't know if it's because of events and the general feeling of ""lost self"" or the meds.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, my meds have helped me in ways I can't begin to articulate, but oddly there's a sense of loss there.&nbsp; I read old pre-med posts and I am amazed at my words.&nbsp; Yet now, I do feel a bit dulled.&nbsp; The creative juices don't seem to flow like they use to.&nbsp; If only you could harness the creativity of being bi-polar and lose all the rest hehehe.&nbsp; Sigh

But the events of the last year have sorta forced me to see myself more clearly than I have in a long time.&nbsp; I think it also has to do with living alone.&nbsp; Maybe it's just that I'm on vacation giving me the permission to be reflective and not feel guilty about neglecitng evil lesson plans.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; But I'm sure that has to do with why I'm processing so many thing finally.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I've always lost myself in men.&nbsp; The classic scene.... independent girl meets boy, boy is cool, 3 yrs. later girl wakes up in a foreign place kicking herself for letting it happen again.&nbsp; Okay, maybe it's not classic, but for me it is.&nbsp; I'm just being honest.&nbsp; It's hard for people to admit their faults besides the forgivable ones like, ""i snore"" etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I could pull some freud outta my ass and explain it using terms from my childhood and fucked up dad and wanting to be loved, abandonment issues, blah blah.&nbsp; Which I'm sure all plays a role, but the plain and simple fact is i'm 31 years old and that's just an excuse to justify bad habits of mine.&nbsp; The simple fact is for whatever reason I feel I should give all of me to the person I love to prove to them that my love is true.&nbsp; I try to be the ""perfect""&nbsp; fill in the blank.&nbsp; I struggle and cling and claw and drag love out in an attempt to believe that it actually exists all the while expecting to be dissapointed.&nbsp; As if ""love"" is the only thing that matters, being with someone is the only way to give life meaning.&nbsp; Which is bullshit I know, but knowing and doing are always two seperate things and marring the two always seemed damn near impossible for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

But I feel like I'm ready to let that go.&nbsp; Acceptence that I'm never going to get the reassurance I need.&nbsp; That's not said in a negative, defeatist way.&nbsp; More from the positive angle that I see what I expect will never be enough for me.&nbsp; That I have to learn to accept that in order to lose that perception.&nbsp; Not that no one will ever love me enough, but rather that I would always want more, always be uncertain, always look for the darkside of it all and in doing so I force it out fufilling my prophecy so to speak.

I wonder the thoughts of others, the fears they experience in regards to love and relationships.&nbsp; The true ups and downs not the vague, ""it's hard so you just have to work through the tough times.""&nbsp; We're so vague when it comes to the actual experience of relationships.,&nbsp; That uncertainty, those insecurities, fears.&nbsp; The things that cross your mind in the midst of an argument.&nbsp; What you think when you go to bed.&nbsp; How you feel when you see them at random times, doing mundane things.,&nbsp; The figurative and the literal perceptions fo a relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

So I'm back to finding myself again.&nbsp; That's so cliche, ""finding myself""&nbsp; I regret writing it - I'm back to remembering to live my life again.&nbsp; To read my books.&nbsp; To argue about&nbsp; the inequities between policy and practice of special education and inclusion.&nbsp; Downloading music, painting my place how I want.&nbsp; watching movies.&nbsp; sleeping late.&nbsp; All those things that I manage to take from myself of my own accord.&nbsp;&nbsp;

There's really no ending to this post as there's not a conclusion to my thoughts, my search, my life"

But it didn't work.&nbsp; I was so sensitive about everything that all I could do was argue with him.&nbsp; </p><p>So I started dating.&nbsp; It was weird and not right and didn't last long at all.&nbsp; I missed him more than I could handle.&nbsp; Talking to him every night when he called bella just broke me apart.&nbsp; So I told him I was willing to try again.&nbsp; Then it was he that was distant.&nbsp; And for the first time with him I felt like it was I who was begging him to come back.&nbsp; and it was so humiliating.&nbsp; But nothing had changed.&nbsp; He wanted me in his life, but on his terms.&nbsp; We went to DC to snowboard, it was amazing, just like old times, but once home....back to our dance of uncertainty.&nbsp; Interperting words.&nbsp; Hypersensitivity on both sides.&nbsp; </p><p>I felt a million miles away from him and it hurt so much.&nbsp; He kept me at arms length.&nbsp; And it killed me.&nbsp; But we were ""trying.""&nbsp; I felt so lost, but he kept trying to reassure me, but i sensed his heart wasn't in it.&nbsp; But his words kept coming.&nbsp; What to believe.&nbsp; What do I want.&nbsp; I was lost in confusion.&nbsp; Then the last conversation we had when I asked him if he missed ME he answered, ""sure I miss you guys.""&nbsp; so i laughed my, ""jerk"" laugh and he said, ""what wasn't that the right answer?""&nbsp; Knowing that we didn't have time to talk since his 10 min. was almost up I said, ""it's fine, we miss you too.""&nbsp; And then he was gone.&nbsp; </p><p>Today, the mail came.&nbsp; Bella got two letters from him.&nbsp; I got nothing.&nbsp; He's never said that it's over.&nbsp; He's said he wasn't sure, that things are so hard because of him.&nbsp; That he knows he's hurting me and he hates it.&nbsp; But when I question if we should even try he says we should.&nbsp; He ALWAYS says we should. But then it's at arms length.&nbsp; And he pulls further and further away.&nbsp; He didn't write me for a reason.&nbsp; I know that about him.&nbsp; He's gone and he doesn't know how to say it.&nbsp; And it hurts</p><p>And at times I feel so angry at him.&nbsp; At what he took from me ya know.&nbsp; Like he stole something important.&nbsp; How I'll never cuddle/watch tv with him.&nbsp; Or fall asleep as he rubs my back.&nbsp; How we'll never go snowboarding or laugh at silly things bella did.&nbsp; He was my best friend (besides kt of course haha) and he stole my best friend from me.&nbsp; And now that friend is forever gone.&nbsp; It'll never be like it was.&nbsp; And I don't care that things will get better, and that we'll end up friends, and that maybe it wasn't meant to be, and someday...blah blah blah.&nbsp; Fuck that.&nbsp; He stole my best friend.&nbsp; He stole my future fond memories of him and I.&nbsp; He hurt me.&nbsp; And I'm SOOOOOOOOOOO tired of this re-run.&nbsp; I want my family back.&nbsp; I want my old Johnny back.&nbsp; I want my best friend back.&nbsp; And fuck him for taking that all away from me.</p><p>so that's the story</p>"

"event","<p>Reason # 713 why I'm an airhead.</p><p>Driving home the other day there was a sign on the side of the road in front of a house.&nbsp; It read:</p><p>Slow Death in Family</p><p>So I think to myself, dude, that's mean - just because the person is dying slowly is no reason to tell everyone about it.&nbsp; I mean, what if they get better?&nbsp; Isn't it gruesome to focus so much on the dying part instead of their life?&nbsp; Hmmmmm i wonder if Hospice is involved with helping the person die with dignity........ I wonder if that's considered dignified - stating, admiting to the world the fact that yes, yes world, I am going to die and it's okay to die.&nbsp; Would I want to have a sign when I'm dying that says this to the world? I wonder if I'm going to know when I'm dying or if it's going to be quick and unexpected.&nbsp; I wonder which is better.&nbsp; Hmmm, I don't think I'd want to be super old and drag out dying especially if it's going to be painful.&nbsp; I hope it's not painful, maybe quick is better, but if it's quick then I'll be unjprepared, there will be things I'll be in the middle of, my house would probablly be a huge mess and wouldn't THAT be embarassing - having loved ones have to clean up my mess because I had to go and die before I did laundry.&nbsp; Oh and then people are going to go through my stuff and I won't have had time to destroy any embarassing or incriminating things.&nbsp; Maybe I should find a better place to hide my vibrator.&nbsp; Do I still have those hard copies of naked pics of me?&nbsp; I should probablly lose those.&nbsp; Would my mom get pissed at me for writing mean things in my journal about her if I was dead or would the tradgedy of my death overshadow any angry scribblings in my diary.&nbsp; Maybe I should say ""sorry"" to her in case I die.&nbsp; I wonder if all my friends know how much I like them cuz it's not something you really say to someone and then bam you might die and they'll be all, ""oh, well, Nikki was just a friend of mine."" and that'd suck cuz all my friends totally kick massive ass so maybe dying slowly would be better cuz then I could tell them they rocked and hide all my shit.&nbsp; But when is it that point where you're all, ""I love you man."" Cuz you can't say it too early then you're still hanging on and they're visiting you in the hospital and you say, ""I love you man"" and they're like, ""dude, I know, you've been saying that for the last 3 yrs. since you've been in the hospital."" So the timing's got to be right.....hmmm tough call.</p><p>Then Johnny comes home and mentions how considerate he thought the signs were - alerting everyone that someone had died, that there'd be a lot of cars there etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</p><p>Slow..................... death in family</p><p>duh</p><p>So anyway, incase I die early or hang on for 50 yrs. in the hospital ........ i love you all man!!!!!&nbsp; and hopefully you'll all still love me too - despite my airheadedness.</p><p>:)</p>"

"event","I'm playing hookie right now.  I should be sitting in on a staff development about using interactive notebook skillbuilders, but I figured I already got all the free crap so why come back after lunch just to watch an overly excited ex-tearch profess to you the benefits of gluing your notes into a notebook.  No ma'am, in fact it will NOT change my life.

So instead I'm (for the first time in maybe MONTHS) sitting ALONE in my house with little i NEED to do right this second.  Sure sure there are quizes to grade and I never did get to those kids books they made on how a bill becomes a law, but mini-me seems to like them so everyone gets an A.  Not really.  But one thing I was made even more aware of today was the general ignorance and apathy of most of my students.  I wish it was just me.  I wish I could chock it up to me being a shitty teacher and then not feel so worried about the future of our world.  Unfortunatlly that's not the case.  

But really, that's not the purpose of this post.  Really there is no purpose to it other than I realized I hadn't written in years and I actually have a free second of time.

Yesterday was the oktoberfest/carnival here in town.  We spent hours watching bella go on the kiddie rides, Johnny taking the scary ones and me just basking in the glow of ""family.""  It's something I've never really known or experienced first hand.  Not a normal one at least.  I've spent most of my whole life in one way or another attmepting to piece together a somewhat functional version of ""family"" yet I always felt for the most part I was largely falling short.  I stopped believing that I would ever really know that feeling.  It was as remote to me as the girl getting a new car on her 16th birthday.  And then one day I find myself on the tilt-a-whirl with mini-me scrunched in between us laughing uncontrollablly as we're whirling around at speeds much faster than I thought tilt-a-whirls go.  My eyes squeezed shut at the first sign of dangerous speeds fearing that mini me will for sure freak out and maybe even go flying out of the ride......until suddenly my fear was pierced with their laughter.  It actually forced me to open my eyes and relax my muscles, it's just the three of us......on a tilt-a-whirl.....laughing crazily.   Everything in the world, in that moment was perfect.  The pure joy on Johnny and Bella's faces was pricesless.  As our cart swung around and around at dangerous speeds there we were clinging on to each other sharing the excitment and laughter together.  Nothing else mattered.  There were no worries.  It was all as it should be.  THIS is what it means to be a family.  THIS is what is good, the true meat of life.  THIS is what you live for, these moments, these bonds.  Creating you very own family and watching it work like an artist finally seeing his work come to fruition.  

Later that night bella was exhausted but professed how this was the best day of her life ever.  I had to agree.  She kept putting off going to bed and came into the bedroom where Johnny and I were crashed on the bed waiting to get our next wind to be able to study and do grades etc.  She wiggled her way inbetween us on the bed, one arm over Johnny, one leg over me - taking up too much space but making sure we're both close and within a minute she fell asleep.  There were were, Johnny, bella, kitty and I all squished together haphazardly across the bed.  A family."

"event","I'm just going to vent here because I won't say it to anyone in person unfortunatlly.  Well, maybe it's not unfortunate - saying something wouldn't solve any problem it would just irritate those involved more.  It doesn't matter.  Nothing will be said so i'm going to bitch for a moment. 
 
Fuck josh.  Yeah, dramatic start already.  At least I'm not leaving the reader guessing as to what the purpose of my story is.  Shit, i've been a teacher too long, and I'm not even an eng. teacher!!  Anyway, back to the rant.... he's such an ass.  We break up, but I still let him store himself, his kids, and his crap at my house (the humans were only there on the weekends).   I did this for about 5 months after he left me (the second time I might add) while he was going through OBT and all that military crap.  I was his storage shed - because we'd known each other for 15 yrs. and I'm a pushover.  Then when he was in ranger school i was still his storage shed.  
When he left for that, I told him he couldn't stay with me when he got back.  I told him that MANY times.  I explained that Johnny would be back and that things would be different etc etc.  We even sat down and ""figured out"" what all was going to happen.  Then he gets back and tells me he's staying with me.  I say, fine, only for a few days and no kids.  It's too many people with Johnny, Bella and I.  Oh yeah, the bf is pretty much moved out of his apt. into my house.  Which is awesome for me.  Awkward for Josh.  ""Hey kids, you're going to stay with me while I'm crashing at my ex-girlfriend and her psudo fiance's house.""  Yeah THAT'S healthy and in NO way a Jerry Springer episode.  WHY would he want to stay with us.  WHY would he want to bring his kids over.  But he did both.  Even though I told him no.  And his boys destroyed my house, ate my food, and broke impt. things.  The thing is, I really like his kids.  What I don't like is how he lets them destroy my home, ignore my routines and disrespect everything etc etc.  

We're getting a hurricane sorta here.  So I go around the house to pick up random things (lawn chairs etc) anything that could become a projectile in wind stronger than 30mph.  So as I go around to the back of the house I found Bella's golf club.  We've been golfing.  Lame I know, but I find it oddly addicting much in the same way solitaire is.  You will play for 15 hrs. just to win one game.  With golf (we've been at the driving range) you will hit 1000 balls just to hit that one really sweet shot that goes really far.  The little kid comes out and you exclaim, ""dude, did you SEE how far that went!!""  Anyway, so bella's been going too and actually is good at it.  She loves it prob. because she's able to do a ""grown up "" thing I guess.  So Johnny got her a pretty decent club that was her size.  It's become one of her cherished possessions.  Granted she's five so in a week she could forget all about it, but she's had it a month and still fawns all over it.  We'll go out on the lawn an putt.  We talked about proper  club ""techniques"" such as.... don't swing it in the house, no hitting things with it, no using it on anything other than grass etc etc.  Which she took in with great concentration, repeting back to me all the things she's NOT going to do with the club cuz it's ""special"".  Long story short, for the moment this thing is impt to her and she's been taking very good care of it.  

The reason I tell this story is because the day after the boys stayed here (that night and the next day) bella comes to me concerned because her club wasn't in her closet and she wanted to play golf.  Thinking she was coming around to mistreating it I scolded her for putting it somewhere it didn't belong.  We combed the house, nothing.  hmmmmmmmm.  So now she's REALLY upset.  I tell her that I'll check Johnny's golf bag because it's prob. in there from the last time we golfed.  The next day I checked, no such luck.  So today, when I'm making my journey around the house I see her club in the back yard.  I pick it up and am pissed at her thinking she must've taken it out back and left it there.  As I pick it up I notice the head is all chipped to hell and somewhat bent now.  Hmmmmmmm.  Okay..... so she took it out back and what banged it all over the ground and the house??  huh.  Not really like bella.  She's a wee one and i'm not sure she'd have the strength for that.  But maybe so.  

Then it hits me.  She's afraid of the backyard.  Last time she went back there was the beginning of summer.  The grass is a lot taller out there, there's no backdoor so she'd have to walk all around by herself and there's usually bugs which freak her out.  Then I add it all up.  I goes missing after the boys were here - she never played with them (the boys while they were here) since they were only here late at night on one occasion, but we left early in the morning and they (the little one all day) stayed here.  The little one is use to coming into bella's room, her closet, etc etc.  He's also very strong, and he's also a fan of random destruction.  Just to make sure - to see if bella would admit breaking it or at the very least look somewhat guilty (she can't hide guilt well) I take the club in and tell bella I found it.  She's sooooooo excited - I hand it to her and she sees the destruction and starts crying, ""what happened to it, it's broken!!"" I told her someone must've hit it on the cement or on something hard.  She's crying. So either she's an amazing liar and able to cry on command, or she broke it without knowing she broke it, orrrrrrrrr Josh's little one broke it.  Unfortunatlly I'm guessing it's the latter.  Especially because Josh has a tendency of not watching them when he's busy doing something and they have a tendency to destroy.  And I'm sitting here thinking ""SEE...SEE!!!!! This is why i didn't want them over here asshole.""  But I know the little one is just a kid and doesn't know any better.  I also know that Josh needs to learn to watch them and control their behavior.  And even that is could be possible bella overcame her fear, went out back and beat the shit outta the club.  I also understand that my anger and frustration is about more than the club. That I'm getting to worked up over this because to me it's symbolic.  It's not about the club.  It's about Josh being careless/unaware (like the always is) and that action resulted in damage to the club (representing my life/happiness).  As if he's trying to destroy the happiness I now have without him due to his carelessness.  I know it's not THAT symbolic.  I KNOW he's not trying to ""destroy my happiness""  but damnit, i'm being selfish here and i can be pissy and symbolic if I want.  For somereason today it means more to me than a damaged golf club johnny gave bella.  To me right now it's another show of disrespect on his part towards my life now.  Grrrrrrrrrrr

I'm bitch because I had a shitty day.  Today there was a class assembly.  All the 10th and 9th grds were in the gym.  I have all 10th grd. so I was there too.  The got to hear exciting things like, ""Dresscode and you."" etc.  So I'm sitting there and Ms. R. the Vice P. is speaking.  I'm in the front row writing down some of the dates and room numbers of things she's talking about.  Right in the middle of that I hear, ""Ms. NELSON!!!  I don't appreciate people sleeping while I'm talking, I just don't TOLERATE that.  That's got to stop and it's got to stop right NOW.  You just don't sleep in my meetings""  This was said mid-sentance.  I sat there stunned.  Shocked.  Did that just happen??  Did she, my vp, a supposed ""professional educator"" who's always talking about staff unity and happiness, just SCOLD me and accuse me of sleeping during an assembly in front of ALL THE STUDENTS I TEACH?  My coworkers??  The entire 9th and 10th grade classes?  WTF?!!  I felt all my blood settling in my face and I actually had to sit there and fight the tears.  TEARS>!!  Oh HELL NO I'm not going to cry in front of all these people especially because SHE WAS WRONG??!!  I so was not sleeping.  Anyone who knows me knows I wouldn't do that.  When it comes to work I'm a nerd.  I'm a goodie goodie.  Sure I'm no angel, but at the same time i'd NEVER do that.  So I stop taking notes on her thing and just sit there steaming.  Thinking about how I was going to quit and sub. for the year.  etc etc.  She finishes and I get right up in the middle of the gym and follow her ass outside.  I had my speach all prepared about how unprofessional that was and she of all people should know I wouldn't do that and even if i was SNORING everyone knows that if you call someone out like that it's just going to cause retaliation not solve the problem.  How now she'd underminded my authority to my students for the rest of the year etc etc.  All sortsa badass shit that I was going to say.  I got about half of it out and got emotional a bit.  No crying, just so angry I actually couldn't TALK!!  She kept saying, ""I don't understand, I don't know what you're talking about etc.""  So I repeated everything step by step to which she said, ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I wasn't telling YOU to stop sleeping I was telling you to get the kid seated behind you to stop sleeping.""  She spent about 2 min. trying to assure me that I had mis heard her (even though all of my homeroom kids sitting next to me started snickering and whispering, ""ohhhhhhhh Ms. Nelson got busted hahahaha.""  Now I know she truely believes she said it to get me to wake a kid up.  The prob. is she's always going so fast in so many directions that a lot of times she doesn't pay attention to people, herself, what she's ACTUALLY saying etc.  I left wondering if I did mishear her.  Until 4 other teachers came up to me throughout the day saying, ""omg what was THAT about"" etc etc offereing their sympathies to me and their shock that she'd say something like that in front of all the kids and how they saw me and SAW i wasn't sleeping etc.  

So here I sit.  Pissed.  Humiliated unintentionally and just frustrated as all hell.  For the 1st time in over a month i'd actually KILL for a smoke.  And the worst part is there's nothing that can be done about any of it.  I'm not going to have ms. r get on the intercom and clairify the situation.  How lame is that come on.  that makes me look even WORSE.  I'm not going to bitch to josh how his kids broke something impt to bella given to her by johnny and how i told him not to bring them and how to me that represents him disrespecting what I have no etc.  He'd just say his kids didn't do it and even if he said they did he's sorry, it still makes me petty.  So instead I sit here. Pissed.  Wanting to smoke.  Irritated.  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

Okay I'm done.  Sorry for wasting anyone's time :)"

I sit here on the eve of another school year.  Another notch in the belt.  Another 9+ months filled with annoying kids who want you to love them so much that they tell you to fuck off just to see if you'll stay.  With parents who are sure that their drooler is filled with only goodness and intellect.  With administration who think that it's enough to equip the staff only with a copy of ""Who moved my cheese"" and then spend the rest of the school year MIA.  I'm venting.  I'm disgruntaled.  I read once that a majority of teachers leave education around the 5th yr.  This is my 5th yr.  or is it my 6th.  I don't remember anymore.  

I feel as though I've been in a car speeding ahead at 200 mph only to hit the breaks suddenly.  That feeling that you left your stomach and lungs somewhere about 3 minutes back in time.  This was by far the best summer of my entire life.  I really think that's true.  I was writting my aunt telling her about our trips to Chicago and Savannah and New Orleans and Florida etc etc.  and it really sounded like I was living someone else's life.  And now I get to go back to ""reality"" so to speak which in a way is a welcomed event because it's something I can depend on.  I'm not too familiar with ""happiness"" so to speak.  Not that I'm a horribly depressed person.  I just always wait for the other shoe to drop.  It seems like things have been too good to be true.  

Ah well.  Hopefully it will pass quickly."

"event","That's right 17.  I wonder what their catch phrase will be.  ours went something like, ""The class to be is 93""  Yeah, we were creative.

Nothing rhymes with seventeen.  

""We're keen on 17""  

Except I can't see usage of the word ""keen"" making a comeback anytime soon.  Maybe they'll have to invent some new slang term.  

oh oh oh!!
""Class of 17, you know what I mean""  

And yes yes yes, I am trying to distract myself from the ever present fact that my daughter just expereineced her first graduation and I did indeed blubber like a baby.  So many different directions I could take this post.  So many different directions the thoughts in my head are running.  For example

About 5 and 1/2 yrs. ago I was in the bathroom looking at a pink little stick thinking, ""wait, is it one line or two lines that's good, huh, maybe this is a misprint.""  Holy fuck here come the waterworks.  Even as I sit here typing this I'm there in my mind.  In that other life of mine.  I remember leaving it sitting on the back of the toilet so I could come check it again to make sure just in case it's wrong.  And there she was.  My little bellaboo.  Swimming around in my uterus.  Okay, not really swimming around there but just chilling.  Cells dividing, genes creating that crazy hair, the silly laugh, that insane brain and vocabulary which allows a four year old to say things while watching Shrek like, ""mom, in our society donkies don't talk do they.""  Yeah folks, in our SOCIETY.  Mom's Soc. degree is rubbing off hahaha.  But she was there.  My flesh creating her flesh.  Out of me she came.  And I swear to GOD!! I was only a year ago.  Somehow someone screwed with the space time continum.  It wasn't 5 yrs. ago?!!!

And 5 yrs. from now, she'll be 10.  TEN!!  Then 15 then TWENTY.  All in  3 years ""mommy"" time.  MY BABY!!  In 13 SHORT years I'll be sitting at her highschool graduation.  I'll be looking around at the other parents and we'll all be giving ourselves this same astonished expression wondering how the hell did we end up here when last month we were sitting at our childs pre-school graduation.  As a HS teacher I see that look on the parents faces every year at graduation.  Most think it's astonishment that their kid ACTUALLY graduated, but I suspect a different cause.  I suspect they're looking at all the kids, freshly scrubbed and ready to conqueror the world and they're remembering how  they swear LAST YEAR they graduated and Shannon Nanney sat right next to them and DeAnna Powell mooned everyone wearing a purple thong (school colors) and put a big 9 on one but cheek and a 3 on the other.  How Leighton Dwinells sung a bad country song.  How hot it was sitting on the field in June in the Arizona desert................ and that look of disbelief is that this is THEIR CHILD'S graduation.  Never before has 13 years seemed like such a short ammt. of time.  
     
I will be 41 years old.  Bella will be 17.

I feel like singing the Lion King's ""The Circle of Life"" hahahaha  Okay, i'll stop now.  I need to go cuddle my baby.  My ""Lean, mean class of 17""  Holy crap did I actually say that?!  hahaha"

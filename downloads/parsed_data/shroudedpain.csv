This past week has been boring. Theres nothing to do anymore. I feel like everything in life has just become trivial. it seems like theres a big picture now, yet I just have to place all the peices together to see it. Im only a fucking kid. I dont want ot do this. I dont feel like Im ready to gorw up, and face reality. I am scared to face what is in the future for me. I am afraid to see what LIFE is to become within the realm of what I am now liveing. I want ot be home for good. I am tired of liveing in two houses with no real home. I want a life that I can life for myself. I feel that I am liveing out things for everyone else. I just wish I could say ""fuck you all"" and go out on my own.

Well, in short, Im home. I have nothing to do, and it feels good to be able to relax. Its really something that I havnt done in a long time. I just need some time to myself to gather what is left of my shattered childhood, and see what I can do with it before I am called to a point in life where it will have to count.

Admittedly, there is strong energies that come from both sides of our family, but my mothers being Wiccian has (what I think) a very strong influence on everything that I and Tywyn are about. 

Wow. this is just so amazing.........I have a lot of work to do. as for now, I have a book to get!

P.S. Tywyn, is it just me, or when Father starts talking about boats, and the ocean life, does it seem like his eyes get blood-shot, and pop out a little bit. (Kinda like the Gym teacher in Daria) that and it looks like he starts foaming at the mouth......

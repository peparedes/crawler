"event","when was the last time i updated? sheesh nearly six months ago. i'm a bad friend, for real. 
i should have more updating time now though since all i do all day is sit in front of a computer. but really, i'm not complaining. i love my little world of computers. i also love the treasure trove of office supplies and endless fridge of beverages. ahhh corporate life, how i love thee. well so let me see. what's new? besides everything. 
1. i live in the USA. more specifically, New York. most specifically, on the same street as the cosbys. well, the same street that the outside of their apartment was filmed all the time. and some movie too. i live in the west village and it's amazing. it's actually a lot like notting hill. and there is a GREAT bar across from our house. called Little Branch. 
2. i work at FactSet. It's fun. I do financial consulting, which is code for ""play with computers all day"". it's cool though. 
3. i go to the movies with ali all the time. actually he's waiting outside my office right now so we can go see bond. (james bond.) 

yes

more later. and by later i mean soon and not in six months. 

ps. when you are trying to spell something to someone over the phone and you have to think of a word that begins with V... the one you're looking for is VICTOR. yes. VICTOR. (not vicodin. shit.)"

"event","so i'm pretty boring as of late. being quite active though. lots of bicycling around sweltering london and we did go to the park and see lots of deer which i really liked. we also went on a boat in the middle of hyde park in the serpentine and ali insisted on rowing. which of course i didn't mind too much. 

ive started uploading some of my pictures from various things onto a website called flickr. if you want to see them go to www.flickr.com, click on ""browse popular tags"" and then click the people tab in the search field and type in kerrin_beth. 

i dont know why it's so complicated. if anyone knows a good (better) online photo album service, tell me . actually i bet ERIC knows a good one.....

anyway, coming back home soon 
i'll get more funny soon

"event","seriously. 
i'm just lazy and busy and have loads on my mind. 
yes yes i'm STILL in london, but i'm moving home soon.
i'm going to grow up and get a real job and ali is going to come with me and try to find something fun to do in new york. that should be fun. 
first we're going on a holiday to tenerife and then home to boston for matt's engagement party and alana's wedding. 

yeah one of my best friends is getting married. that's not scary or anything (:: jumps off cliff ::) 

what else. i go to school and take business classes and still bartend a lot. but besides that i've gotten very very lazy. it's funny how when you are shit broke you find yourself sitting at home ALL THE TIME. it makes me SO lazy. i mean i know i could do something meaningful like go to the park and walk around but (of course) the weather here is always shitty so that's not exactly enticing. and i could go to the museum. i could. but it's far. so i always just resign myself to sitting home and watching (yes, it's REALLY addictive) Big Brother. seriously how sad is that! to be fair though i still work 40 hours a week and i'm at school for an extra 12 so i'm really tired by the time it gets to my days off. it's just kind of a shame though. if the weather is nice soon... (it seems like it will never stop raining) 

it's nice when ali and i both have the day off though, we manage to find something entertaining to do. 

i saw orlando bloom at the pub we live above. 

he is short but VERY handsome. 

it was in this star sighting that i learned... i am star struck. hardcore. 

i'm also addicted to the UK version of US Weekly (but SO much trashier) - ""Heat"" 
as in cover-to-cover addicted. ouch. 

i cussed out the dude at amex a few weeks ago and now i can't send any money home. oops.

"event","it's so funny the way that ""home"" is changing all the time. 
for the first time, i got on the plane in heathrow and as it was taking off (actually, it was on the heathrow express train to the airport that i first noted this but this was before i was delayed for 2 hours on said train due to a ""fatality"" on the tracks. which kind of diverted my attention as you might imagine) i felt like i was leaving home and going.. well somewhere else that was not home. 

i've been absorbing family time like it's going out of style. which is funny for me because usually whenever i come home i disappear night after night with various friends and hardly catch up with the family at all. but there is a wedding afoot and thus lots of events and family time
no surprise completely filled with too much alcohol, but what's better to bring a crazy family together? 

my dad's got these new polo shirts that have the little polo horse in the corner, but the polo horse is like 200% bigger than normal. 
i find this so appropriate and fitting that i can't help but smile whenever i think of it
  
and poor dad got his teeth bleached right before coming to the big dinner in new haven and so couldn't eat or drink anything not white. this is my dad who loves red wine (hates white) loves red meat (hates fish) etc etc, so it was kind of sad. but he was a trooper. until the end when he and my brother ordered 20 year old tawny port and then joan ordered him to drink it with a straw as to not fuck up his very pricey teeth. of course my dad was like ""i am not drinking it with a straw"" until my brother flagged the waiter over ""can i have another straw please?"" - nothing like solidarity in numbers. it was touching. 

then today at the engagement party everyone was wearing nametags, ie. ""Kerri - sister of the groom"" and the like and matt's said ""Matt  (i am in love with susan)"" which i thought was the cutest thing. 

ali is coming up in a week - should be fun, a little nervewracking, but fun nonetheless.

so i'm 24. rubbish. mid-twenties. but my birthday was really really nice. 

ali brought me champagne and roses and cooked me breakfast in bed. 
then we went to the science museum (underwhelming) 
and high tea at the dorchester (amazing. and saw a celebrity from this car tv show that we watch all the time and i nearly went epileptic) 
and milk & honey, rupert's bar, and floridita (which was JUST like a south beach bar right smack in the middle of london. awesome) 

then we were drunk so we went to burger king and home. 

has anyone who isn't in the UK heard of a band called boyzone? because i don't think so. or at least i didn't. but i was watching ""top 20 boyband videos"" (i know) and in at number THREE was this video by this band and i honestly thought it was a joke. like one dude had this eyebrow that looked like he slept on a razor and had a bad dream. and then this other guy was all solemn and sounding all nasal and operatic at the same time. what? ew. i find it really hard to believe that people find this band talented. same with ""girls aloud"" which is just hot girls in skimpy outfits that can't even pretend to sing well (make britney look respectable...)

"event","just a snapshot of my life at the moment: 
- i take a suitcase with me to work about once a week, stuffed to the brim with dirty clothes so that i can do my laundry at the bar. 
- i have funky hair. like creatively funky hair to the point that the vidal sassoon guy that cuts it (every MONTH) is forever parading me in front of his collegues. like to the point that if i don't do it correctly (it doesnt take much effort, but still) it looks like i got wasted and got intimate with a big pair of scissors
- i cooked, from scratch, a whole meal of sausages and mashed potatoes (""bangers and mash"") and steamed green vegetables and gravy for my boyfriend. let me repeat - *i* cooked. (i don't cook) 
- i have had 3 exams in the past week all of which have involved me cramming to death at the last minute and surprisingly doing quite well. until today when i show up for my exam and the instructor says my exam was actually on tuesday and i have missed it. oh wicked. 
- i have seen factotum (fell asleep, big time. i'm sorry. i was just really tired and it wasn't stimulating and i dont like matt dillon), narnia, harry potter, broken flowers all in the past month or so. since when do i go to the movies all the time? oh yeah, since it's 2 for 1 on wednesdays. that's when 
- andy has returned to mook which in practicality is fine and means i get to actually spend a morning with my boyfriend (before either he or i had to open every day so no such luck) but in theory is making ali a very grumpy boy and subsequently kerri very on edge. 
- dad has sent me a new light box for hanukkah, but this light box is like no other. it seriously is massive. it reminds me of the monolith from 2001 a space odyssey. when you turn it on, if you're in another room, you just see this REALLY EERIE GLOW coming from the front room -- like some UFO or something has landed and is shooting out its high beams. i kid you not. (thanks dad)
- i've been thinking lately how i havent seen or talked to people in forever. like people that when i was in the states, i would see and talk to or email with at least once or twice a week. it's making me a little sad. to me it just feels like i'm in england for a little while, but then i look back and it's been like a year and a half. but i'm coming home soon. for vacation at least. 
- finally getting wifi in ali's flat so i'll have at least some sort of regular interaction with the internet instead of having to use the unreasonably restricted computers at school. 
- las vegas season 2 is not as good as season 1, i dont think. but i've finally managed to get ali addicted to it (he was resisting before) so now i can watch it at my leisure
- i've become one of those people who takes irrational amounts of vitamins. really. the idea was to prevent getting sick but it failed. but im convinced it's healthy anyway (right?) so i'm taking multivitamins, evening primrose oil, cod liver oil, vitamin c + iron, vitamin e and echinacea.  
- you'd never guess by looking at me, though. i quit smoking so on top of being sick i have that terrible cough that produces all sorts of creepy blackness. it's also come at just the right time because i get to be that girl in the 3 hour exam room that is coughing and sniffling and sneezing to the almost audible eye rolls of everyone around me. this one girl sitting at about eleven o clock in relation to me made a point of adjusting her seat and turning to me to glare and pointedly roll her eyes in my direction after i had a particularly juicy coughing fit. i seriously looked at her and was like ""dude. clearly i'm doing this to upset YOU""
but then her cell phone went off and my dick professor made her ""apologise to the class, this instant!"" for disturbing everyone. ha ha. 
- as soon as i finish my exam this afternoon (if i can even take it, that is) i'm going to start reading memoirs of a geisha because believe it or not i have never read it and am dying to see the movie. 
- i'm now one of those people that sets their phone as their alarm clock. i kind of swore i'd never be. no particular reason, it just bugged me. but oh well. 
- i really enjoy drinking shandies at night. i bought a big thing of lemonade (read: sprite, but lemony-er) so i can mix with the random bottles of tiger that live in our fridge. mmm. 
- ali got unbelievably wasted the other night, threw up everywhere, and passed out on the bathroom floor. no really, guys, he's 27. really. i swear. and spent the entirety of the day prior to that playing nintendo ds. 27. cute though. 

ok. im going to wheel my shit back to work and do my laundry and try to study for this exam that i may not even be able to take because i misread the exam schedule. 
merry xmas :)"

and don't you just know it... in the past few days about 6 people have commented on how ""run down"" ""sickly"" and ""really worn out"" i look. wicked!

change is in the air, though. good change. really. 

i am trying to teach myself how to cook. for real this time. i made a maple pecan pie that was actually quite nice! except ali's oven is so fucked that even though i cooked it for two hours it didn't cook all the way through and had to bring it to work to cook properly. my next venture is sausages and mash. i bought the jamie oliver book. it's enthralling. everyone at work is kind of giggling at my attempts to be domestic. probably because i am so aggressively anti-domestic. 

i did, however, have ali's flat cleaned. (note: i said ""had it cleaned"" and not ""cleaned it myself"" - one can only be so domestic) - PRICELESS. the place was a dump prior to the cleaning. as in, can't walk around barefoot. but now it's nice. yay.

note to everyone who isn't me: dating your boss is a bad idea because you feel obligated to pick up everyone's slack when normally you would just say ""not it."" and move on with your regularly scheduled programming.  
boo
but anyway 
last night was the night of the living assholes. it was great. i blatantly called some dude an asshole, his friend then complained to the other girl who was working, who said ""she most certainly did not call him an asshole!"" (she hadn't heard) to which i turned around and retorted ""Oh yes i did. he's an ASS HOLE"" 
it was great. 
i was laughing my ass off. 

then there was this AMAZINGLY terrible woman who was just the worst customer ever. I had to remain in control (ie. *not* tell her to take her mojito and shove it somewhere nasty) because ali was right next to me on the bar, but when she walked away even he said ""i would have told her to get fucked LONG ago."" it was kind of amusing but overall, RIDICULOUS

then some guy tried to push his way in after close and ali and the doorman physically forced him out, saying ""dude, we're closed, man, i'm sorry"" to which he responded ""I'M A FUCKING GIRL!!!!!!"" 

whoops

but then he/she got arrested by some random passing-by cops so all was cool. woo. 

today we had an excruciating staff meeting, but then i treated myself to a VERY MUCH NEEDED facial. MMMmmmm. facial. 

seriously fell asleep on the table. hadnt had a facial in about 2 years. felt great. 

now am packing up my room, woo

by the way, how great is grey's anatomy? i think i cry every episode. and the oc has become totally rubbish. and i'm addicted to nip/tuck. 

OH and i tried to download some episodes of all american dad because ali really likes it, but only searched ""american dad"" and it randomly ended up downloading about 9 different varieties of porn (japanese anime porn, amateur gang-bang porn, soundless creepily possessed people just downright having sex porn)

"event","ali and i went to this koto-esque restaurant yesterday called benihana. it's an american chain that i had heard of (i think in some trashy novel of some sort, actually) but i recently discovered that it had branched out to london. ali is a particularly picky eater and was subsequently quite skeptical but figuring that since previous picky-eating boyfriend was massive koto fan, chances were good that ali would approve. 

overall, it was yummy and satisfied my craving. ali seemed to like everything for the most part with only a few exceptions (ie. california roll, the eating of which precipitated an ever-so-lovely ""kerrin, i believe i just wretched"" comment). I think we were so tired that we were giddy. ali pushed me off of my chair which caught me by surprise and made me flail my arms and cause a HUGE scene. this made me giggle maniacally and made him really embarrassed that everyone saw him push his girlfriend, so he started trying to cover, saying ""Kerrin, you're not supposed to lean so far back on your chair!"" which made me laugh even more. I'm pretty sure the entire staff wanted us gone. 

The funny thing about this restaurant is that it looks really nice, and the food is really expensive, but the menus are literally laminated plastic sheets circa Denny's 1988. hmm. one feels a little out of place ordering chateaubriand from a glorified placemat. you know? 

It was also unsettlingly cold yesterday so by the end of the day i had accumulated the following: 
tee shirt
jeans
sneakers
zip up sweatshirt
coat
winter hat (brown and hot pink with ""nigel"" written on side) 
fingerless gloves
purse
backpack full of laundry (ali's)

which, if you add all together, makes ==> HOMELESS LOOKING KERRI

we decided to walk home to ali's from the restaurant since it was on king's road. King's Road is a relatively busy street - lots of pubs and bars and shops and whatnot and a pretty posh area of london. ali thought it would be fun to walk about 10 paces in front of me and sporadically turn around and yell ""STOP FOLLOWING ME, TRAMP!"" 

needless to say i was laughing so hard that i actually did look homeless and crazy. 

ha ha. 

today i unfortunately slept until it was already dark out, but that gave me the chance to go out with vish. we went to tk maxx (london's version of tj maxx) and hmv and out for coffee. fingers crossed, we're going to move into a flat on portobello road at the end of the month. woo! went out to dinner with becca and then came home and took a bubble bath. 

mmm.

mmph. 
been working loads, not leaving enough time to clean my room, which i think has developed a social life more extensive than mine considering every time i enter it, it looks like some unknown force has thrown quite the hoppin party. 
saturday night i had a proper night out - mook, soho,cherry jam, house party. much fun. kind of a throwback to the typical nights out i had this summer -- andy finding a girl to sleep with and me having to avert my eyes such not to feel FORCED to tell his pseudo girlfriend who is home thinking about him, ali being inexplicably angry with me for the duration of the night (and me convincing myself that the most effective way to deal with this is to call him about six times whilst being drunk), and ending up in my bed at 7 in the morning, too wired to sleep, too smoked out to smoke a cigarette, etc etc. 
kind of glad summer is over. looked like death incarnate on sunday. 
My friend richard had a similarly heavy night on saturday so we smoked a big fat joint together sunday night which was nice and much needed. 

home seems to be a disaster. every time i look at cnn.com (because my flat is too ghetto to get any tv at all, oops) some other place in the states is in the process of getting destroyed. karma, you know? still doesn't stop me from missing it though.

what is new 
i went to the new location of the sotheby's institute today. as in, my school moved between last year's class and this year's. 
okay
whereas it used to be in the most run-down inadequate location for a school with no internet capability, no real library, no ventilation, like 2 classrooms, etc. it is now in this unbelievably posh row of buildings. slowly i am beginning to see where all the money i paid for this course has gone. seriously! there is a starbucks in the new school! 
not fair

my friends gozde and alex are getting married at the end of the month. my first real peers' wedding! crazy. 

i cleaned my room today and watched ali g. also RAN AROUND THE CITY trying to get shit sorted for new school, old school, visa, nat'l insurance, etc. 

ooh got to go to ""pages"" the bar supply store. 
that was fun 
office supply fetish = fun, bar supply fetish = orgasmic

in the states, go to ""sur la table"" and into the bar section. it's amazing. at least the one in nyc was (i think the one in chestnut hill is actually good too) unfortunately i got a massive ticket outside of it. boo

"event","work, life, everything has changed in the past week. 
i've been so overwhelmed with *everything* that i find myself losing my shit like every 10 minutes. but i actually feel almost normalized in the midst of all this. today was my first day off that i've had since i've been home and i spent it relaxing to the max. ali matt and i made breakfast and watched school of rock this morning. then i played ""the sims"" (apparently i'm ""retardedly rubbish"" at video games. whatever. put me in front of an old school nintendo and the ""contra"" cartridge and you will be singing a different tune, my friend), took a ridiculous nap until 7pm and then went grocery shopping, hung out with the flatmates (and watched the OC) and have just been chilling out. 
so what's been going on. well work is fucked. turns out andy got suspended but not fired, so when he came back to work, matt (the head bar) promptly quit, and i got promoted to head bar. so things are a little on edge these days. ali DESPISES andy and is thus constantly stressed out about leaving him alone at the bar. Matt moved in with ali for a few weeks until he moves back to corsica or australia - that's been fun because the three of us hang out and it's like a constant fun time. 
i'm having tons of issues with my school and my visa. i have to make like eight hundred phone calls a day and it's really stressing me out. in fact everything's kind of turned on its head. usually i'm all stressed out about ali and everything is just cruising along. now it's the reverse. 

there was also a little while where i thought i was going to get to ride ali's vespa for a year. 

oooooo

i heart vespa. 

i also bought krispy kreme donuts today. yummmmm"

"event","wow, new york was amazing. 
many pitfalls, but absolutely an unbelievable vacation of sorts. 
didn't end up getting into the city until 330a on thursday night (due to traffic, ali being stuck in customs and my driving incapabilities) but the hotel we stayed in (dream hotel on w55th and broadway) was AMAZING. all blue-lit and techno-cool and whatnot
did some touristy stuff on friday; went to times square and empire state building. then did a few different restaurants and bars that evening... highlights being the bar in the Waldorf and Tao - yum. also went to the underbar in the W in union square which was cool but drinks were poor, tried to go to sugarcane but it was privately booked and went to the ava lounge on top of our hotel but it was pretty dead 
saturday we went to balthazar (one of my favorite restaurants) for brunch and then we walked around soho for awhile. we decided that we're probably going to open in soho (doesnt everyone say that) because it makes the most sense for the kind of bar we want. really kind of feasible considering the bars that are there now - we went to the bar in the soho grand and then spent a really long time at the church lounge in the tribeca grand which was AMAZING. then had kind of a catastrophe trying to get into the flat we were supposed to stay in but it worked out okay in the end. sunday we met with brad's brother at The Falls on Lafayette and Spring then to dos caminos tequila bar in soho and the thom bar in 60 thompson hotel. very cool. it's kind of hard to recall all of this because as you can imagine, much of many of the days was spent in a drunken haze. fun though. the highlight of the trip was going to milk and honey on sunday night. it was amazing. the drinks were perfect, the service was impeccable. they even had kiehl's products in the bathrooms :) 
then it was 9/11 so we drove down to ground zero and walked around there for a little bit (at 230am) - drove back up and got some hotdogs in greenwich village and then went to bed. monday we went back to balthazar and then it was so traffic-y that we had to go right to the train station to send ali on his train to the airport. 
really an AMAZING time.

"event","home has reached its peak comfort again - i've managed to see many of my friends (although not all yet, boo)  and i've found new haunts and gotten a bunch done. mistake me not, i still haven't touched my dissertation. oh, Shit. 

i managed to go to the capital grille (my mum works there) three nights in a row. first with larry and meeting lavinia there, then meeting alana there for drinks, then taking kekane there for drinks. the cute waiter teased me that i was stalking him. ha ha. 

had my meeting with Fernwood and things seem to be pointing towards new york with them. which is cool. but they still haven't given me a number so i don't really know what kind of likelihood exists that i'm actually going to be working for them. 

went out for dinner with dad and had a good chat with him about career choices and whatnot. also got to check out the PIMPED OUT hummer. seriously. he juiced up the sound system, put some sort of video camera in so when he puts it in reverse he can see what's going on behind him, it has a DVD player in the monitor on the console, it's just unreasonably tricked out. it also gets something like 10.6 miles per gallon. glug, glug, glug. no comment. at least it makes him happy. if you're going to be a gun-toting republican, at least have a RIDICULOUS gas-guzzling automobile on top of it.

spent some time catching up with kekane. he lives in a GORGEOUS place in Brighton and it really seems like he's settling in. I even got to reacquaint myself with Pierre! Lovely reunion. We baked up and watched Winged Migration. and he told me about his cooking prowess. jealousy has no boundary. 

yesterday I chatted with ali a bit and he seems really excited to come visit. i've managed to sort out and select all the bars we're going to and it should be realllly fun. yay. 

took the train down to new haven last night to see matt & susan and stay over here and pick up the car and whatnot. they seriously have an amazing place. i guess i still consider people their age (26ish) to be ""young"" and thus living kind of like me, but honestly, they live like proper adults! it's kind of scary that my big brother is hardcore an adult. mmph. i've never seen so much coffeemate in my life. 

we ordered pizza from the oldest pizza restaurant in the states. cool. 

today is very busy. drive back to boston, do about a million errands, call a million people, pick ali up at the airport and then drive to nyc. in about 16 hours though, i should be sipping my first cocktail. yummmmmm"

people in the states make fun of me for my ""british"" accent
i've worked really hard to not acquire the british twang. and i dont sound british, i know i don't. i think people just expect me to have the accent so look for reasons to point and laugh. 
however
i have acquired an interesting language idiosyncrasy. 
in french when you speak about yourself, for emphasis you say, ""Moi, je fais xyz.."" so my friend Matt from Corsica translates that exactly when he speaks English ""Me, I can't eat *anything* in the morning or else I spend entire day on toilet"" 
and I'm probably the only person that recognizes this little translation thing. even funnier, i find myself doing it. but only when flustered and excited.

"event","went to foxwoods with mum and larry. 
i love foxwoods
living in notting hill, it's rare that i feel like an attractive member of the fairer sex. seriously, everyone in notting hill is a ""fit bird""
but at foxwoods, the majority of the population is overweight and underattractive. so by default, i must look pretty appetizing! maybe more importantly, i was a young girl roaming the casino on her own. regardless, it was nice. i like gambling, too. i pretty much camped out at one table on friday night and another table saturday during the day. 
of course, both times, i managed to snag an incredibly cute dealer. 
today's dealer was REALLY cute and sociable and friendly, and well, i have a thing for blackjack dealers. he was a relief dealer, so essentially he covered all the permanent dealers' breaks, so he dealt my table 20 minutes out of every hour. it was cute. he kept sending the pit boss over to tell me to stay at the table and wait for him while he was working at the other tables. cute. crush. so before i left i gave him my number. something i dont really do, but he knew i lived in london, i figured it couldn't hurt. he actually called me tonight and we chatted for quite awhile. 
it's really funny 
he's just like bryan. 
really light and easygoing and social at his job 
and really introspective and one-on-one in private (i guess it makes sense) 
and most interestingly, rough around the edges, pretty hardcore. 

it's funny. i must be really naive. even though i'm clearly less so than i was before moving away, i've got to be missing some crucial interpretive link that sends a message to my brain that says ""yo. you haven't a clue on earth how to relate to this guy's life""
seriously
i mean i've had my share of eclectic friends so I kind of pride myself on my ability to have a productive conversation with pretty much anyone, but jeez. 10 minutes into our conversation he's talking about his friends bringing guns out to a club, how he's friends with all these strippers, how he dropped out of high school and passed his GED instead, and then (drumroll) about his son. okay. my dad has some guns that he COLLECTS. you're more likely to see me associated with a paint stripper than a female one. we won't touch the education one because i'm a little bitter towards the education system these days, but okay you have a child. 
regardless though we had a great conversation. as much as i constantly rant and rave about how i hate people, i actually really enjoy meeting, genuinely meeting and getting to know (beyond superficially) new people. so that was that
lots loads of cash at foxwoods, too busy batting my eyelashes. but on the plus side, i earned loads of ""wampum points"" which are these points you get that when they add up you get free food and rooms and stuff. i guess the pit boss can award you more points than you rightfully should earn if he feels as though you are bringing ""profit"" to the table and making people want to play there and stay there. and so the dude hooked me UP. free trip to foxwoods! 
another plus to the day was that i brought my godforsaken fucking broken ipod to the mac store and found out that my warranty had run out like a week ago (not cool) and that they don't so much fix ipods as they do just replace them, and if they break out of warranty, you're just shit out of luck. awesome. but anyway the guy was really nice and managed to grandfather me under the warranty and give me a brand new ipod!!! kind of sad about losing all my music, but can regain most of it off my computer and plus, new functional ipod. supercool. 

okay any suggestions for good 80s songs to download? i'm getting delirious so off to bed. 

ps. funny line for the night. i was telling my mum about this blackjack guy (his name is laau) and how he's kind of rough but kind of cool and writing screenplays and making movies and whatnot: 
me: yeah, i mean he's a proper filmmaker it seems
mum: sure... an *ADULT* filmmaker?

ah mum, always assuming the best for her daughter."

"event","i'm sad because i havent posted in ages (honestly havent had time) and thus i don't even remember all of the RIDICULOUS crazy shit that i've done in the past month and a half. needless to say my life has been really crazy and really really fun as of late. 
i live on kensington high street in an amazing flat with a bunch of really cool people
i've been working full time at mook which has been minorly stressful but mostly lots of fun. we hired all sorts of new people that i've been helping to train up and whatnot so that's been cool. 
there have been LOADS of crazy parties - petros and asta's leaving party,ali's birthday, marc's leaving & andy's birthday, staff football party - it seems that every week we're all getting together and getting wasted. 
of course that leads to incestuous mook family, but what else is new
becca hoffman-greenwald, lavinia, and chris all came to visit me (one right after the next) which was fun for a few weeks albeit a little crazier than normal. 
my once-sporadic and casual relationship with ali has kind of stepped up a bit such that i now stay there more often than at my flat. which is a funny kind of thing that seems to work out quite well, as long as it remains unspoken. we close the bar, we leave together under the auspices of him taking me home on the bike, and then we just go back to his flat and fall asleep watching movies. i actually really enjoy the time i spend with him. we watched a documentary on fish a few weeks ago. 
he's flying out to boston and we're going out to new york next weekend to properly research some bars and talk to some people about potentially opening a bar together. i'd open a sick ass bar. 
last weekend was notting hill carnival. absolutely ridiculous. i've never seen so many people drunk at the same time (no, not even at green key) - i'll have some pictures to upload, but it was just CRAZY. all of us worked loads of hours, we were all tropical-attired out, WASTED, and had a ridiculously great time (until the police blocked all the public from our bar's entrance because of ""congestion"" - yeah - the police brutally FUCKED us last weekend. boo) 
marc went back to australia which made me sad - it's funny, i'm now one of the oldest members of the bar; karolina and ali are the only people that have been there longer. crazy. 
me and my new roommate karen (american!) caught a mouse in our kitchen the other day. i am not good with mice. cf. my room sophomore year in college. 
now i am back in the states for a week or so. we are going to foxwoods in a few minutes (yay gambling) and the weather is spectacular, and nothing (nothing) warms my heart more than seeing the boston skyline as we arrive into logan. 
but to be honest, home doesn't feel like home anymore. i'm really excited to see my friends like josh, lavinia, kekane, bradford and alana and that will be amazing, but it's not like i actually live here - and i only say that because it makes me want to actually move back even less. i have that job interview thing on tuesday which will maybe make it a lot more attractive, but i dont know. it's the first time i've come back that i've actually thought ""i miss london""
my parents (all four of them) keep tossing around the idea of moving to florida. i walked around bloomingdales yesterday and almost vomited from the kinds of people that live in my city. 
BUT 
there are countless amenities back here in the states that i have missed so terribly. modern washers and dryers, for examples. oh the luxury of fabric softener! seriously i went into the legal seafood's restroom (mmmm legal seafoods) and there was an automatic toilet flusher, automatic toilet seat cover, automatic water faucet, automatic SOAP DISPENSER and automatic hand dryer (both air and towels were available)
what the fuck
even the electric brasserie in london has manual faucets. 
have americans become too lazy to pump their own hand soap? 
not that i'm complaining i was just entirely taken aback. 

and let me just say, it is AMAZING to come home to a place where there is ALWAYS food in the house. seriously. at my flat, since i'm never there i eat dry cereal, all the time. it's honestly the only food product around. here there is fruit, there is popcorn, a full bar, it's like heaven. 
yum. 

alright my parents are getting antsy, time to go to foxwoods. wish me luck, blow on some dice for me."

he's an actor, he used to be on Hollyoaks, which is this soap opera type program here.  
sadly he has a model girlfriend. as in, a girlfriend who is a MODEL. 
ouch
of course he's so hot that his FIRST night some chick gave him her number. 
(actually it was funny. her friend came up to him and was like ""here's my friend's number, she says you should call her"" and he goes ""you should tell your friend that she's really fucking fit."" i thought that was awesome) 
what's great about this guy is that when he was on TV he played a gay guy, so he can like slip into FLAGRANT homosexual at the drop of a hat. it's ridiculous, especially because he's a relatively masculine, chill dude. this of course probably contributes to why i think he's so cool.

my amazing flat in notting hill fell through. 
not cool. 
we went into the real estate agent 2 days before we were supposed to move in to give her the final paperwork and money, and she is like ""i just received an email that your flat is being repossessed and your landlord is being sued. you can't move in"" 
fucking hell
i guess he hadn't paid any bills on it, ever, and wasn't even legally allowed to rent it, etc etc etc. 
all sorts of badness (then the sketchy landlord tried to track us down at mook and try to swing us moving in under the table. not so much cool) 
we were trying to figure out if we could just kind of move in and do it super sketchily, but then we realized that we could come home one day and find our door locked and us evicted, and lose all of our stuff. nope. not happening. 
so i've been FRANTICALLY trying to find somewhere to live. there is this other AMAZING flat that is right across the street from mook that *might* work out for us - this landlord is just being super choosy about who he wants to move in, so it's a little up in the air. we'll find out tomorrow. 
otherwise i went to go see a room yesterday in a flat that is right on high street kensington - it's AMAZING. the flat is huge and has a huge lounge and the other people living there seem REALLY cool. so if the notting hill flat doesn't work out, HOPEFULLY that room will. it's a little further away (and unlike the notting hill flat, my boss doesn't conveniently park his bike RIGHT outside of it...) but it's still an excellent location, and it would be easier to bail out of if i move back to the states in november. 

in any event, housing crisis. especially since i've been crashing at amanda and caroline's now for a very long time (evne though i'm paying) and it's wearing thin on all of us. 

what else. i got asked if i were peruvian today. interesting. 

i also met a really, really cool guy at the bar tonight. australian. 

nothing much else to report, i guess. weather's been gorgeous, tube is still fucked, i am addicted to bloody marys

"event","I guess I'm due for a real update. A hell of a lot has happened in the past few weeks. It's been one of those times where when I've had a few free minutes, I've tried to start writing a post, but never quite got it done. I now have just a few minutes so I'll bullet-point it up. 
* I found an awesome, awesome flat with Andy from the bar. It's literally ON notting hill gate, I will only have to fall out of bed to get to work. It was really great how we found it, too. One day he was just like ""let's find a flat together"" so we just went to all the estate agents and looked at all the available flats upstairs at mook. We found this one that was right next door and we went back to the estate agent to see if we could set up a viewing. she was kind of just like ""oh, it's right across the street, we'll just go now"" so we went over and looked at it and it was HUGE. and we just took it. Matt from the bar is going to live with us as well, as is his friend Dave and his girlfriend. Should be interesting. an american, two australians, a corsican and a brit. fun. i'm actually really excited to have my own flat for once. we move wednesday
* I've gone out on about a million dates this past week. Apparently when it rains, it pours. Had a ridiculously memorable Monday two weeks ago (one of those nights that i'll remember for the rest of my life, even though some of it is fairly spotty) - went out with Andy and two friends of his and got SMASHED at the Lonsdale. ended up ""snogging"" this guy Tom, who i had met before at Trailer Happiness, the bar he manages. did this in front of EVERYONE (ie. tons of people i know) including Ali (my boss who i have crushed on forever) which ended up causing all sorts of funny drama. Then a few days later went out with Tom again to Milk & Honey, this super posh throwback 20's styled speakeasy bar. SUPER cool. Private members bar that Tom could get into because he's the manager of a bar in the same company. Needless to say, i was impressed. A few days later I went out with this other guy, Steve, who I'd met a few times - he's the manager of ANOTHER bar (me and MANAGERS. as my friend marc says, ""bella, you need to get that shit SORTED before you get into the professional world"") - all in all, upshot - it's fun to be single. it's fun to go out on dates. 
* I quit my shitty-ass job at the Arts Council. I essentially stopped going. My advisor was like ""wtf"" I was like ""hmm. data entry and cold calling. NOT SO MUCH. peace."" so now i'm kind of just bartending (i'm pretty much full time now) and getting myself sorted and writing my dissertation. In real life, I've decided I might want to stay here for a few years and see if I can't manage a bar. I also really want a Vespa. But lots of things need to fall into place for that to happen.
what else. 
i just got off the phone with this guy from Fernwood, which is really exciting because now i actually might have a reason to come back to the states. hmmmmm. 
* lenny kravitz and alicia silverstone both came into the bar last week. ooo.

yesterday we walked all around notting hill and went boutique-hopping. made our way to tom's deli which was Ridiculously yummy. then wandered around more and I had a dissertation meeting (work? what?) at london bridge so we made the super long tube journey that a way. then we went to bond/oxford street for awhile, home to shower and change, smoked a bit with caroline and then trekked off in search of food. got lost and ended up at gourmet burger kitchen which was supremely satisfying but i am still unbelievably full from it. we had lofty goals of going to the lonsdale and trailer but it was too late at this point, so we went to mook and had a drink, went to the gate (reggae night, not so much) went to the blag (super hot and sketchy weird people there), then back to mook and home. fairly uneventful, but fun. 

the night before we really went barhopping because it was maya's birthday so we wanted to go all out. we met marc at apartment 195 where they need to BUZZ YOU IN to go inside. all women bartenders and really cool atmosphere. then we went to cafe bodegas and used our staff voucher thing to get 50% off really good tapas. yum. then we went across town to soho, which i had never seen at night. this area of london is like the big cafe/bar gay part of london; in actuality it reminded me of greenwich village, a LOT. it was a tuesday night and super busy so very very fun. we went to lab, which is this bar that has AMAZING cocktails and hung out there for awhile. then we tubed to notting hill gate and tried to get to the lonsdale before close by taking a cab, but they were serving last drinks when we got there, so no cocktails. so we walked back to mook and went to the gate (which was american hip hop, which i have sorely missed to be honest) then we sat at mook, managed to get in trouble (yes!) bought some beer and sat by the church for awhile. we took marc's bus back to his and ali's flat and hung out there waiting for our cab (read: passed out on his couch we were so tired) 

the end

today we have a champagne training at 2 and i have to work at 6. so maybe we'll go beer garden hopping in between that time.

some of us, we have to work hard
just to get our little part
and maybe your glamour's not in Boston
but my friends are fucking awesome
and we'll keep on doing our best
even though our lives are a mess

and we go
will this check support this tour?
will this tour lose my job?
without my job where's the rent?
should we all just call it quits?
the dinner dates sure cost a lot
when 28 bucks is all you got
and your life is at a stop
and all your dreams are all self-taught

and this is the difference between our lives
no wonder tonight you feel alright

"event","i love summer because my days always just seem more relaxed, no matter what i'm doing. last summer was probably unsurmountable in terms of relaxing, fun, debauchery, but this summer is great because... who else spends their summer like this? well, lots of people, but who else in my sphere of reference does? 

yesterday was great. i was supposed to work at the arts council, but i emailed and made up some excuse about joan being in town and said i'd come in today (im here now) instead. i slept in late and met andy (also known as ""burger"" because he finds the american pronunciation of burger really amusing) at the tube station to hang out. he was buying dvds at virgin and in addition to layer cake and dodgeball i convinced him to buy chasing amy (the thing about the british is that they haven't seen SO MANY THINGS - like he'd never heard of ""married with children"" or of any of the chasing amy, mallrats, etc series. wow)

he was super hungover so we went to a pub (""the cock"") and got greasy pub food. then we went to waitrose and back to my flat and watched anchorman. great film. but terrible quality on my laptop. then he had to go to mook for a mtg (because all the tills have been under for the past month) and i went shopping. sadly i found nothing because urban outfitters is insanely expensive and has NOTHING compared to the states' stores. then i went to a dept store and tried to find lingerie and another bathingsuit, but to no avail. then i tried to find a necklace and/or a replacement tongue piercing, again to no avail. frustrated, i went to mook to work at 6

of course as soon as i get there i have to make about 10 smoothies (read: worst item on our drink menu, essentially fruit puree, ice, sugar syrup and milk. EW)
then the bar is dead all night, which is okay because i'm in a really lazy mood. we close and go home. marc comes and crashes at my flat since both caroline and amanda are away. we smoke a little, watch risky business and order pizza. 

i had forgotten what a ridiculously good movie risky business is. tom cruise looks embarrassingly geeky for the first half of it, but it's so well done! but it is way more graphic than i remember. i think there may be a number of different versions of it. hmm. 

all in all a good night. risky business probably the highlight of it, but hey, could be worse. 

my ears are still popping from being sick, and getting on a plane in 2 days is NOT going to remedy this situation. boo. 

if anyone has constructive hints for barcelona, comment me."

Sardinia was absolutely beautiful. 
It happened after the most hectic week(s) ever but it seriously was the most cleansing thing ever. 
what sucks is that i was really sick the whole time. boo. 
it seemed like it was going to suck at first because when i arrived at the Alghero airport (read: one room) there were three major problems: 
a) I was so sick and had such a high fever that i was literally delirious. 
b) maya, who has been traveling around italy for the past two weeks and who i was spending this whole vacation with, was NOT THERE
and then ultimately
c) I speak not one word of italian

so here i am like FUCK. im in this tiny little town on an italian island. i dont know what hotel we're staying at, i have no way of getting in contact with her, and i have no way of communicating any of this to anyone. plus i feel like i am going to DIE

i wander over to the tourist desk and feeling like the WORST STEREOTYPE OF AN AMERICAN EVER say ""i'm sorry but do you speak english?"" luckily she does and helps me out and gives me a whole thing of hotel info and stuff. it's 930 pm now (my flight got in at 830) and all things in the airport close at 10, so i figure i'll give maya till 10 and then just go to a random hotel 
luckily maya shows up
never been so happy to see someone in my whole life

then the trip was just bliss. honestly, we just laid out on the beach and wandered around the old city and ate amazing gelato and other food and wine and just relaxed. one night we just sat on our terrace (yes our hotel room had a terrace that looked over the beach) and split a bottle of wine and just chatted about life all night. it was awesome.
i needed it so badly. 

last night at work everyone was like ""wow, you look so happy and you seem so pleasant"" (which is a huge deal considering what a MESS i had been beforehand) 

anyway

last night at work was fun regardless of my beachy happiness. the DJ was awesome (even though the volume levels were fucked) and we ended up just chilling out and making cocktails until about 4 in the morning. we all had these other lofty goals of going out (there was a party and a bar in our thoughts) but sean from the lonsdale (who is really fucking cool) just came over, we got KFC (what) and it ended up just being 4am suddenly. 

today i slept in real late, made coffee (from italy in an italian percolator, yum), watched the OC and some west wing and went to work. 

woo

i'm in such a good place now though. all this shit that was eating me up is all gone and i have so much to look forward to. i go to barcelona with joan on thursday, john dominguez is flying in tuesday, maya's coming in on the 21st, there's an AWESOME concert i want to go to on the 30th, etc. 

and lavinia is going to come visit sometime in july :-)

fat
yay

come to london and visit me, everyone.

"event","this is from eric. i love my music memories so i appreciate this kind of stuff. bear with. 

Step 1: Open your MP3 player.
Step 2: Put all of your music on random.
Step 3: Write down the first 10 songs it plays, no matter how embarrassing.
Step 4: Add what each song makes you think of after you type the list of songs.

1. Soul Coughing - Lazy Bones
Hanging out with Bryan, listening to music in his bed. smoking cigarette after cigarette, all songs on random. And the mike doughty concert with lavinia and bryan and julio. 

2. Black Eyed Peas - Hands Up
I've never listened to this song on purpose. It's one that comes up on my hip-hop/gym shuffle. so i guess it reminds me of the sweaty smell of the gym and dying for the beats to go just a little bit faster so that my running goes by quicker...

3. The Postal Service - This Place is a Prison
I used to listen to this entire album from beginning to end. 

4. The Avalanches - Since I Left You 
Mook before the DJ gets there... the kind of music Ali plays that I pretend to hate but really groove along to quite nicely. Cranberry juice and limes. Stupid crushes on my bosses. 

5. Annie Lennox - Pavement Cracks
Senior year at dartmouth, I really liked this song. It reminds me of our apartment. Of my room in its final arrangement. Of trying to convince Brad that it was a worthy song (but failing) - she really has a sweet voice though, and it gets all badass (or as badass as an annie lennox song can get...) towards the end. Another empowering song. 

6. The Killers - Smile Like You Mean It
Oh god. This song has London written all over it. Oxford Street, walking home after the gym, riding on the bus, trying not to miss my boyfriend too much, mouthing along to all the lyrics. Bryan. My mini-obsession with the Killers. Walking through Portobello market, too cool by myself and with my ipod. 

7. Joshua Radin - Closer
I got Joshua Radin off of too many episodes of Scrubs. He's amazing. All his songs make me cry. This one in particular. When I first heard it, it made me smile, a lot. I couldn't wait to go home so I could have Bryan listen to it. Then we were having a big (which turned out to be THE) fight and we were in the car and I said ""i just want you to hear this song"" and I played this song and for the first time it made me really, really sad. Funny how music does that. 

8. Mary J Blige - Real Love
7th or 8th grade is what first comes to mind. But then is the WICKED mike doughty cover of this song.I still know every word, how great is that. 

9. Tripping Daisy - I Got a Girl 
I heard this song for the first time on the Real World season that had Puck (was that like the 3rd season or something?) WAY long time ago regardless. I fell in love with this song, though. I remember they played it when he dyed his hair blue. Actually I think that was a different song. I think it was Pavement - Cut Your Hair. But this song I definitely got from that same episode. Weird. 

10. Muse - Endlessly
Sex."

Well that's how it's been with my journal. every day it kind of stares at me. ""Update me!"" but so much has happened - i went home for a few weeks, i broke up with the boyfriend, i had some job interviews, i went up to dartmouth, i met alana's new boyfriend, i met brad's boyfriend, i kissed a bunch of my old boyfriends, etc etc. but let's just let that be that and move on. 
now
i am back in london 
this past week has been kind of a mess because i'm in this weird transition phase because im moving out of the flat in a week, but i've just gotten back from vacation. so it's kind of a waste for me to fully unpack because i'm just going to pack again in no time, so i've just been living in proper squalor for the past week or so. 
i finally bought the west wing, so that has been taking up lots of my time, as has online poker and drinking. 
lots
of 
drinking. 
not like ""oh let's go chug 9 pints."" no way. 
i've become a bar snob by association. 
my ""oz"" (that's slang for ""australian"") friend marc who works with me at mook has become the real proper bar snob. he's made friends with all the bartenders at trailer happiness (ridiculously cool bar on portobello road) and lonsdale (consistently in the top ten bars of london) and so since i've been back, it's been ""let's go get a drink at [this ridiculously expensive but awesome bar]"". last night, for example, i went to go meet marc for a drink after his shift at mook because he got stood up by a girl earlier that day 
we ended up walking down to the lonsdale where we met sean (a cool guy named sean? never.) who ended up hooking us up in a major way. i had a watermelon martini (unbelievably girly but SO TASTY), a straight up angostura 1919 daiquiri (smooth and vanilla-y), a fruity vodka concoction, and a salad. marc had a straight up rum shot, a pirate xo treacle, a straight up margarita made with some tequila that even i didnt find repulsive, and a tequila shot. our bill should have been somewhere in the 150 pound range. no joke. we got charged 35 pounds. WHAT
so wasted as all sin we stumbled back to mook where we met up with caroline and abe (her friend visiting from VA) and amanda and her boyfriend warren. our boss (who i continue to crush on hard) gave us a hard time about our drinks (the irony of going to your OWN BAR and getting haggled for money after being at someone else's bar and getting comped 2/3 of our bill was not lost on us) and then we all went back and smoked a bit at our flat. 
then cute bartender sean from the lonsdale and a waitress from there came over as well and brought a bottle of vodka of which i was not keen on at all, but a good time was had by all. 
i have managed to be NOT PRODUCTIVE AT ALL 
which is a sin 
but really, i have two projects left before the summer starts. 
i have 2 more days before i find out if i'm actually going to be living here for the summer or going back to boston to work at fernwood. 
i have one more week before i move out of this flat
can you blame me for drowning my sorrows in expensive spirits and sleeping until 3pm every day?
not really.

i'm going to sardinia with maya on the 7th.

But then again, who would read it? Furthermore who would pay to advertise in it? thus, maybe not. but i'm getting really frustrated with the art world. everything can't be groundbreaking. some of it has to be crap. at least in music magazines they give ashlee simpson one star. you know? give the guy who wanted to paint only in black and only with his toes one fucking star for christ's sake. 
- i'm a terrible elitist when it comes to art. i have to be embarrassed about it at school, but it's true. i DON'T think that everyone deserves to be a successful artist. i just don't. come on. aesthetic darwinism. seriously, i'm getting sick and tired of listening to people tell me that ""contemporary art is crap"" - i'm not sick of it because i disagree, i'm sick of it because all of the good stuff is being diluted out by CRAP that no one can afford (literally) to point out as CRAP. and what results is that there are people who don't spend all their time around art but once in a blue moon, yeah, they go to a museum/gallery. and 9 times out of 10, they don't see the stuff there that's worth seeing because there is so much crap. and they come away saying ""contemporary art is crap"" and that makes me mad. 
- i draw too much attention to the fact that i'm american, and i do it unconsciously. i realize that i have this subconscious feeling that everyone only thinks of me as an american and nothing else. thus i validate that notion (as a defense mechanism) by acknowledging that i'm american at every given opportunity. but what that does is make me look (of course) like a typical american who can't get beyond her country. ah what a tangled web..."

friday night i met our new manager, Andy. young, british, absolutely adorable and wonderful with cocktails. we all got pretty drunk at work and apparently afterwards i was (in typical drunk kerri fashion) completely loud, effusive and giggly and offering for andy to stay at my house and whatnot. how embarrassing. oops. then saturday i worked on my spreadsheet until i had to work, i worked with gozde which was great because I hadn't seen her in forever. and she told me that she and alex are getting married! What!? Of course nobody that reads this knows who these people are, but alex is my old manager and he and gozde have been seeing each other for a few months and now they're getting married! how great is that. probably so great to me because they are the first people i know who are getting married. in any event, after work marc and i went to a party at karolina's and proceeded to get pretty crazy until like 4 in the morning when we came back here, smoked the hookah and he crashed on our couch. yesterday morning caroline marcie and i went to lucky seven diner for sunday brunch. lucky seven is this cute place on westbourne park that we always drive by but i had never been to. very very good food, but a tiny little place! only four booths or so! so we finally sit down and who is sitting DIAGONALLY across from us? awesome. this guy who has come into mook a few times, i gave him my number awhile ago, he called me once from paris asking if i wanted to get together and then never called me again. YEAH!!!!!! I have all but quit smoking cigarettes, but it was 1045 in the morning and i was chain smoking. not cool. then i came home to find that my CD-ROM drive on my laptop is *completely* fucked. as in, whenever i open it, it scrambles my computer and restarts it. yeaaaaaaaah. really, really cool. i proceed to freak out and wake my dad up. he calms me down and tells me to just take out the CD-ROM drive, so i do. 
i think this is manna from heaven - some higher force making it impossible for me to dedicate my entire week full of schoolwork to 24 and the west wing. although in reality i'm still going to buy TWW Season 5 at HMV before I go home and dedicate a hearty amount of time to it after I get my computer fixed. booyah. 
work last night was fun. met some cool people, made some good cocktails. made no money though. boo. 
and now i am back here at square one, writing my paper.

most exciting news i've heard today (besides nina going to arizona. arizona apparently ROCKS. adopt an iguana. congrats!) 
i actually got some work done today which was a miracle. then it was beautiful out so caroline and i went to the grove cafe which is this outdoor balcony bar that overlooks portobello road. it was nice to sit outside. then we came home and all three of us shared a nice smoke outside in the garden. then i watched animal house and we cracked open 24 season 1. episodes 1-4. yay tv addiction
tomorrow i will try and do work again. 
i come home in a week and a half. good news. 
email me if you want to come to see big d and the kids table with me on may 6th"

Apparently this is an international confusion. 
Ha

"event","talk about things i am so happy i did
i was having a wicked shitty day yesterday, starting with going to my internship and being kindly instructed how to do ASININE DATA ENTRY for two hours before becoming sick to my stomach and having to leave early. then it took me literally 2 hours to get home (should have taken 45 min) because the Circle line (yes the tube line that runs in a complete circle of all things) was broken down. so i came home, took a nap and was supposed to meet my friend marc to go to this concert at like 630. I dragged myself out of bed and haphazardly applied my punk makeup (""sigh... more electric eel blue"") and made my way over to mook. we had a glass of champagne each (yay leftovers from wine tastings) and i was stoked for the show. 
we got there and it's a pretty small venue but definitely cool. definitely reminded me of the middle east in boston. i bought the best t-shirt ever. best for the following reasons: 
1. it is a youth medium, so it actually fits me 
2. it is black so i can wear it to work 
3. the back says this is BOSTON not LA. YEAH BOSTON PRIDE
4. the front has LA with a big red X through it. (sorry eric. i know you love LA.)
at the merch table i was talking to this dude and i realized he was american (the band, big d and the kids table, is from boston) so i was like ""are you from boston?"" and he's like ""yeah, i play guitar."" i thought nothing of that and was like Oh cool where do you live?! he's like oh i live in brighton, so we chatted about cityside and whatever. i turn to marc (who's australian) and am like COOL HE'S FROM BOSTON. so we manage to scrape together our four pounds and buy a pint and a half. which leaves us collectively flat broke. it's cool though. there are two opening bands, neither of which are ska/punk which is what big d are. both are more screamy-rock bands who can't seem to placate the ska snobs in the crowd. entertaining nonetheless. i love live bands. especially with hot male members. i'm a sucker for a proper rock star. 
then big d comes on and they ROCK. and the guy at the merch table from boston who plays guitar? yeah he PLAYS GUITAR FOR THE BAND. so he comes off stage and i maul him. freaking out and OOZING groupie. i told him i was going to be in boston during their next show (may 7) so maybe i'll see him. starstruck. cool shit. great, great concert. 
then we went to alex's flat so i could check it out. Turns out it's in a really sketchy area and would be a really bad commute home from work and is about a 10 minute walk from ANYTHING. so i was kind of freaked out - saying to myself, great so i'm hoping to improve my life this summer and what i'm going to be doing is moving to a place where i dont know anyone, where it's scary to walk alone at night, and where i will spend most of my time by myself. boo. made me reevaluate a lot of things. 
then i came home and got a very promising email from one of the companies that i had written to in boston. so that made me feel a lot better. 
a good day all in all. 
today i didn't go to any class, instead i bummed around for the entire day, celebrating the international holiday. 
caroline's birthday of course. 

new pope in town

"event","so there have been a lot of changes and there probably will be a lot more in the next week of my life. 
not necessarily bad, but definitely different. 
we finally found someone to let our flat, so we're definitely moving out June 4th. i've been flat hunting myself for the summer and i think i might end up renting alex's room on the east end. my two roommates would be longtime friends of his from spain -- carlos and... carlos. nice. and it's  a nice place, apparently. i'm going to see it tonight after marc and i catch big d and the kids table. 
bryan and i are having some issues but i think it will work out for the best no matter what. 
my coursework at sotheby's is kind of coming to an end, i have 2 big papers due next week, a paper due june 1st and a big group project due june 1st. then all i have to do is my dissertation. it will be interesting to have this whole summer to work on this big paper. it might be a death trap for me because i might just be lonely and miserable here all summer. but hopefully i will have lots of visitors to distract me :)
and worse comes to worse, if i find myself single maybe it will be a good way to have a clean slate with which to play with my next few years. who knows. 
i saw some sort of wealthy transvestite at topshop yesterday. bags and bags and bags of clothes and a really bad dye job... and an adam's apple. 
i still haven't heard from ANY of the jobs that i sent out cover letters / resumes to. not one. not even a ""you suck at life"" email. awesome.
i randomly hung out with jeff beardsley last weekend. he is a very very cool kid. 
i should go back to doing work"

"event","i'm back at my wicked cool internship. 
one thing that i know i will always remember and look back on regretfully (for not having taken bigger advantage of) is the fact that i seriously walk by the houses of parliament and all that stuff every time i go to work. of course there are always about a MILLION tourists that i have to push my way through (annoying) but at least i'm not one of them and i'm actually going somewhere for a purpose (gratifying) 
but maybe i SHOULD do the tourist thing one day, considering i am here all the time anyway, right? what exactly does one do at parliament? look around the buildings? ooh and ahh at the guardsmen? boo. 
i can see some important building right here from my window
(if i were slightly more educated i'd probably know which one it was) 
additionally, speaking of my lack of education, there is some big election going on here and i have NO idea what it is for. which makes me feel like a BIG, classically american IDIOT. 
of course i know nothing about the country in which i'm currently living. i'm american, and thus only concerned with things happening in my OWN country. I don't do anything to help dispell the stereotype by toting my US Weekly around with me. 
maybe (just maybe) instead of reading trashy US glossies i should buy a newspaper or something. 
there's a thought."

"event","my day was surprisingly satisfying even though i stayed up until 4 am strangely obsessing over zach braff (he's kind of an endearing fellow. especially after watching all 3 seasons of scrubs.) - i only ended up with around 4 hours of sleep but i guzzled a red bull in the morning and that seemed to jumpstart me quite well. 

i took the wrong bus to the tube station because i'm an IDIOT and thought i'd save time but instead had to spend an extra 30 minutes on the bus AND get some sort of weird cracker concoction drooled onto me by some obnoxious screaming toddler who realized he couldn't get his ""my hair is bleached so blonde it could potentially cause blindness"" mother to pay even three seconds of attention to him (does it even take three seconds to tell your child to STOP SPITTING ON THE NICE YOUNG LADY SITTING BEHIND YOU? doubtful) and thus focused all his energies on yours truly and her freshly pressed pants. awesome. but seriously i had a good day. 

so i arrived at my first day of work for the arts council (my internship) - i thought it was going to be 100% boring data entry BUT it is actually really interesting! PLUS they have all these gadgets. I have my own email address and PHONE NUMBER which follows me to any phone in the building that I choose to log into. cool, huh? it gets cooler. so let's say you try my personal extension and i'm not there so you leave me a voicemail. cool. when that happens, i get an email telling me that i have a voicemail and embedded in the email is a wav file. i click on the wav file and POOF my phone rings. I pick up the phone and it plays me my voicemail. 

HOW COOL IS THAT

it's actually kind of eerie. 

i can also search for people in the organization right on the phone. 

anyway, it's cool. plus lots of office supplies. and i love me some office supplies. 

then i went to the Q magazine headquarters and most definitely saw some B-C list celebs, but paid them no mind as my ambitious ass made its way to the front desk. I talked to some woman who said that while they weren't hiring, she could probably set me up with a few weeks of ""work experience"" which is kind of like job shadowing. cool. COOL!

then i went and spent a small fraction of my paycheck at HMV. i literally spent 2 hours in hmv because the branch i go to is the biggest in london and they are having a HUGE sale. i ended up buying Las Vegas season 1 and 24 season 1 (i miss american tv) as well as Divorcing Jack on DVD (which was only 4 pounds) and a few books about poker players. 

then i managed to switch buses 3 times (really) before finally making it home, ordering some indian food and indulging in some quality Alias episodes with caroline. the latest episode was GOOD! although me and caroline have a theory that there is no more sex in the show because in real life jennifer garner and michael vartan probably hate each other. boo. 

i'm going flat viewing tomorrow. and to work. 

yee-awn."

"event","what's going on: 
- i spent a fucking cool week in dublin. seeing mr. bodie was a trip like none other; surreal for the entire time i was there (i mean what else is it going to feel like when you haven't seen someone in 7 years and then suddenly you're just hanging out with them like nothing happened? amazing. but surreal). sean hasn't changed a bit. except for the whole irish accent thing. his ""neighborhood bar"" that he hangs out at is probably the coolest bar i've ever been to in my life. of course if there's one thing the irish do well, it's bars. 
- i couldn't understand half of the english these irish people speak. for real. i even insulted one of sean's friends at a party of his. this dude was like ""come on. we're both speaking english, here."" oops. 
- i can roll an EXCELLENT joint (spliff) now. i even have tools. yay.
- dublin is a lot like london. as sean (or sean's friend) says ""it's london's ugly little stepsister that keeps trying to dress up in her clothes"" 
- ha
- so ireland was great. we didn't do much, just chilled a whole lot. which was great because i really needed a stress free week. we slept till 5pm every day. how great is that 
- sean likes scrubs. a man after my own heart. 
- i was thinking about the time i spent in mexico with alana and lavinia and brad. we had really yummy SPICY candy while we were there. hmm. i dont know why i thought of that. 
- I LOVE HMV. it's like musiclover's paradise. they are having this MASSIVE sale. i went in yesterday all frustrated that i can't play a freaking DVD on my computer because they are all region 2. then i talked to a dude that works there and was like YO. is there anyway i can watch these without having a region 2 player? and he told me about a program that i could download that would trick my computer. and LO AND BEHOLD. he was right. so now i'm going to go on a DVD buying spree. 
- with all of my money
- that i don't have. 
- oops. 
- but the west wing season 5 comes out here on april 25. bomb. 
- i've pretty much decided that if i can find a good place, i'm going to stay here for the summer. wooo. 
- i like joshua radin. his music is on scrubs all the time. good stuff. 
- i need a job. 
- there is a cover of the 80s song ""Out of Touch"" - it's hilarious. i love 80s pop. it reminded me immediately of my brother. 
- i want to work for the magazine Q. maybe that's my calling. to work for a magazine.

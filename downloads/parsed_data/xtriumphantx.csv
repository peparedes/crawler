"event","16 hour days have come. i stay inside and revel in my air conditioned home. i read. the mccourts, compsons, joads, and an invisible man have made my break real friendly. carla and i met the one year of being an alliance of abstract excellence last saturday. best friends are still the same. roommate gets drunk every weekend on wine; laughs are made concerning lava, sadism, and masochism.  sicko made me cry (fuck).  i really dread when this shit is over.








<lj-cut text=""red, white, and blue grocery"">
pt. I
as i strolled down the pasta isle in the grocery store,
an old indian man approached me
to inquire about tomato paste and its where abouts.
but
i did not know where the tomato paste was
because i do not even know what tomato paste is.
""is it not with the spaghetti sauces?"" i asked.
""no. no. i don't know.""
""well, neither do i.""
i did not know.

pt. II
not even five steps away 
from the old indian and he approaches me again.
however, this time was to inquire about the location
of garbanzo beans.
much like the tomato paste situation,
i did not know
what garbanzo beans were.
i know green beans,
white beans,
and baked beans,
but not 
garbanzo beans.
i quickly made a few hand motions and said
""the garbanzo beans are two isles to the right!""
i directed
the old indian man
to the soda and chips isle
because 
i simply did not know.

"event","I'm not able to get on the internet that often.

So this is going to be my swan song for the good ol' lj.


But just for the hell of it, these days I just sit around in my hot, internetless, cable-less apartment making fun of my girlfriend.  Zack Tarr's my room-mate, of course! I read a godawful amount of books.  Getting stoked on the awesome furniture I get. I had to put Daniel on a chain today because he's starting to get unruly (bummer).
I start back to school on the 28th. I saw Ashley Byrd for like 3 hours about a month ago, and that was pleasant. I had a pretty sweet beard, but I shaved it.  I got a new car this summer, but I wrecked it two weeks later crashing into a pregnant lady, real awesome. The car's getting fixed the 21st though.  I've almost helped finished an opus from September 22nd entitled ""Hello, Throne."" 

That's my life.  And life is busy, but good right now. However, if I gave livejournal two more weeks, it'd probably change, right?  Because that's just how livejournal works.

Anyways, Keep in touch or something.

My dog fell on my sisters cd player and broke it. I though it was pretty halarious frankly. Cait doesn't know yet.

The people, places, the smell, the atmosphere, everything. It has been  a BIG ajustment.Coming from Sydney to Crecent were I have to drive 10 minutes to get to a bodgy grocry store and the nearist servo is aprox 5 miles away. 

I am craving a good dose of you kids at home like crazy. You have no idea. I can't even begin to describe how much I am dieing to see everyone.Seriously.

Things are starting to look up here though. I have seen most of my freinds now wich was WONDERFUl. Some of them have become people I don't know though:(. Luckily most of them are still as wondeful as I last recalled. 
 
I  saw Evan again!  It was last night. And it was wondeful, just splended. He is seriously so wonderful. He is just so kind and careing and really brings out the best side of me. It is soo hard for me to be cranky around him even if I want to. It is really looking like we're going to make it. Buttaflys as Nester would say ahhh.
his be evand: i love you too casey
this be evand: with everything
this be evand: thats why i was soo nervous
this be evand: because i truely love you casey
this be evand: and i didnt wanna mess anything up'
this be evand: that was one night with you
this be evand: and everything felt right
this be evand: so after time

Evan broke a promise to speak this weekend, yet again. Shocking? Nope not at all he did the same thing last weekend. He realy needs to watch were he's stepping. Aparently he has been an ass to Sussanah,Rene,and Rose again. I really hope he knows that if he does this bullshit when i come home its over. I may love him but i won't put up with this bullshit when i come home thats for sure.I apologize to everyone hes been an ass to. Im sick of him breaking every promise.

I got a hair cut. It's a lot shorter. Not to sure how to describe it myself but Aliki said  I look like im from the future in a movie and i need a silver turtal neck and a lazer gun. And the more i think about it the more i agree. Its ether soccer mum or artsy. Im indecicive of wich, but its ok i like it i recon.

 Ded ""wanna pick him up"" 
Me ""yeah sure""
/so that was that we picked him up. he was a carnie as far as i could tell. a very very very odd boy who had a monitone voice. when we asked what he did he said he wrote a letter to the us department of exteertarestial life aka alien hunters  to try to get a job. i was about to die at that one. lol we got a alien hunting hitchhiker. what a 2 for 1 barrgine! well im sitting here in the hotel and i need to do some geomatry.

These tears flow down endlessly.
Blood shot eyes full of tears of love..
They say time heals all but ; you've
 -  scared my heart in all the right places
Whoever they are has never felt such pain.
Your sin stains my lips.
Two souls bathed into one.
Such hope such pain such endless
 -   wonders
This pain will never heal, but sars can be hiden.
My pain must never show.
It's kept in a sealed jar besides my bed.
Dawn & dusk it shows as a rembinder of  you and your 
- love of enertia.
Your other passion has torn us apart
Were will our travels take us from here?
Maby new exotic places, maby new loves.
We'll never know till we get there.
But fist loves will stay forever.

 thats the time my phone telling me i just had gotten a text message woke me up. it was Whit going ""im wearing our boxers"" yeah we share undies. were cool like that. doesnt everyone do that???
 
had school. nothing great happened. i wasnt in a socializing mood wich in Caso terms means i wanted to be cooped up in a box of paint. yet ive knoticed that whenever im not social everyone seems to want to hug me and talk to me. this happens when i am social to but when im not i just notice it oddly. Bevan and Yaz picked on me again in class. Bevan keeps going on how i have a boys name then miss made him apologize and hes like ""I'm sooo sorry Casey you have a unisex name."" and just startred laughing. i dont get it. our class if full of girls why do they chose to talk to me. i good freind of mine in that class *jill* really likes Yaz and is all why does he talk to you i want him to talk to me, why will he come up to you in a crowd and not me. i honestly dont know. i just talk to everyone at school. dont know why.

walked to broadway with the boys. Tim Murry decided Paul and i are sisters so we decided to get sewn together by the tounge to be congruent twins. thats his plan. i said earlobes but he wants toungs and even drew a picture. who knows.

saw Micheal and Jermaine on the bus before mine. Micheal was telling me to get on and Jermaine was showing me his boob. very nice for both the boys. very odd both boys.i like it. Madd has figured me and my little wishywashy lustful mind.

looks like im seeing Brett again tomarrow. hes been bugging me to see him. i told Sooz she said if hes coming to see me i have to see him. she has a point. i just cant understand him.why does he keep doing this.he could have any girl. they all like him yet he refuses to see them. i dont get it. i really enjoy the time we spend together and all and i do like him a lot a whole lot.yet i am so utterly unentrested. we have a passionate kind of rollarskate relationship. hes insisting on seeing me before he goes to Fiji for a holiday. 
so im sitting home on a friday night bymyself lissening to vinal and ordered in some dinnerand im wondering.will i ever find closure in him? i highly dout it. i know when i come home i will always wonder about the boy in Australia who was a breath of fresh air from other flings.

last night i lay awake till all hours wondering about when i come home.will they still want me??? will i still want my old home?? i know i will never be satisfied there it has nothing to offer me except a few good freind, le familia, and a love. im excited about coming home but i wish it was just for a vist to decide to stay or go. id love to colect a few people and leave forever.

this weekend was a compleat blast! i havent wrote since thursday i think. woops. well felix was going to come to see ANTI-FLAG but he couldnt make it beocuse he got his lip peicred the day before. but Loren and i have noticed hes been very very freindly to us lately. we decided it was becosue were awsome lol. jk. i love her shes so funny. and we just concet so welll. so friday at school was ok.i cant realy rember much except feeling extreamly happy all day.i love days like that. and the oddest thing happend when i was leaving school on friday.i went to say good bye to harry and he reached over like to hug me so we huged then kissed one another on the cheeck. i was fully shocked! this is a common practice among good freinds but mainly genrally only girls and this is coming from the boy who just got to were he'd hug girls. i was pretty happy. im pretty sure i turned really red and bashful lol.im not sure what it means though. weve been talking a lot lately.who knows. theres still evan and all but with him i dont think he can rember how it feels to love with all of your self. sadlly...
omg friday night was the ANTI-FLAG concert!!!!!!1 ohh fuck it was awsome. somehow i managed to be FRONT ROW!!!!!! yeah front row sqished against the barrier lol. soo i was right infront of Chris # 2. and ya know how its sooo hard to go crazy in the front row yet you still have people who do.i was one of those people. so christ #2 keep looking at me straight at me and smiling!!!!and it was so fucking awsome. there amazing live. seriously if you ever get a chance to see them go do it! and then chris goes for people to meet the person next to them so he came right up to me and goes ""hi im Chris"" and shook MY hand!!!! i was all ahhhhh! 
the rest of the show was just bloody ammazing. they made the point of how no matter what colour hair,skin colour, sexual preferance, we are all equal and should stop this bullshit fighting over oil. i love them. i agree with all there polotics. fuck corperate bullshit!. then at the end of the show they band all came by the front barrier and talked to us. i meet allll of them and then Justin Sane gave ME A HUG!! i was soo happy. it was an amazing show.
and i picked up as aliki would say.becouse i was talking to some guy with dreads befor the show and i was with brad and after the show he gave brad his number and asked him to give it to me i was off with the band. soo i was a bit shocked lol.

"event","wow what a day.....
today i woke up and i wanted to lie in bed all day and snuggle with that special someone. but my alam clock went off to that song that goes ""they said theyve had enough please turn that fucking raido off.""and its killing me to not know who sings it. i rember emili use to liek it a lot. i really miss emili going on and off songs. becouse shed just break out singing them no matter were they were. and she really cant sing and she knows it wich makes it even greater. i honestly miss her something teriably. not a lot happened at school really. sooz and serz are being really very odd lately. im a bit upset about it.sooz doesnt talk to me at school and serz bairly talks to me at all. its been like this sinse sooz came home. those two just go and do there own thing. we use to be a triangle.i dont know. i just feel left out i gusse.what have i done wrong?? they always say how there part of my family and stuff but tonight sams exabiton opened and they both know how speical it is to him and becouse of that its really special to me. and serz didnt even tell me a reason she just said she wasnt coming. and sooz chose to see brad. it really really hurt a lot a whole lot.
they both knew how important it was. i highly dout thell ever go see it. i almost am begining to feel like im just a convience for them now adays. its really hurting a lot.sorry about bitching. im just having a good cry about it. nothing just seems to be working out anylonger really. i wish i knew why. probally me.
""we acept the love we think we deserve"" 
i drasticly need a good hug lately. more than a hug.
evans birthday is tomarrow.  he finnaly wrote me. it was good to hear from him but its getting very repetative.all his emails are about how hes so sorry he did something that he promised a zillion times he wouldnt do aagain. but everytime he does it. maby its just how thins are.i had  dream about him. he said im trying to live my life but hes holding me back. that was his interpitaion of my dream.in my dream i went underwater. lately most of my dreams have envolved water. but evan is always saying odd things.i dont know why but no matter how badly he treats me wich is ushually pretty bad i acept and love him. im sick of it  but i love him. well maby its a security blanket i dont know. he says he loves me so much but sometimes you have to show it and i wish he would. i cant wait to see him and hear him go ""CASEY OH MY GAWD"" in his little dorky way after i say something shocking,annoying, of funny. and the way he smells. and the way his cloths hang on his body. and the way he stands there kinda clueless,the way he  crinkles his nose and goes ""annt ahh"". how he feels to hug. this is love.
this love is also holding me back from really being with anyone over here.
i am just confused very much.
sams exabition opened. it was soooo amazing im buggerd.

this is one lost teen."

"event","here is the basic idea to get good grades in college:
-go to class
-take notes
-ask questions
-look interested and talk to the teacher
-do your homework

heres what ive done so far:
-dropped 2 classes
-stayed home all last week (because jeremy was sick)
-dont know whats going on in english
-have gone to one class each
f*ucking sh*t man

anyway...so i showed Tilly (her first show) in Lg. Pleasure, and i got a 3rd under saddle.  She stopped 2x's in the jump class because she was too quiet, then she bucked and picked up the wrong lead in the combo.  i hope i get to show her this weekend (in my last junior show ever!)

i also showed Teddy at St Johns.  he went in to warm up early morning, and jumped the 2'3""- no problem.  then i went in for my o/f and he wouldnt walk past the first jump.  ps. Teddy is like 4 inches big.  i am not.  so we got excused, and he picked up the wrong lead in the combo too.  they sucked.  his line was BEAUTIFUL, as was Tillys.  I got a 6th in the hack.  Krissy said it was because i was unresonably big, but really its because Teddy doesnt move as well as stacey shaefers NORTHWINDS DIVA. (hahah, i used to ride her too)
but whatever, they were wonderful.

i miss lauren so much, why does WVU have to be so far away?  i guess thats the point though.

im going to visit her and alison as soon as i get my new car.
(either an audi or a subaru legacy)

im still working at Great Clips.  its bullsh-poop.  

jeremy is good too.  (giving 115%, as always)

i miss all of you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

good luck at college kids.

peace out."

"event","this summer has gone by sooo fast.
it didnt even feel real.
lauren leaves for WVU in 14 days :(

i picked my classes for HCC:
psycology 101
intro to business 101
english 101
and intermediate algebra

jeremy went to California yesterday morning too.  i thought that it would be 6 fun days with my girlfriends before everyone went to college, but im being the hugest baby ever and i know that im sucking a whole lot.  (sorry Lauren!)
i guess its because he is such a huge part of my life now, but like, i kind of feel home-sick...but im home.  its so weird.  ive been really sad and grumpy and not feeling like doing anything.  i dont even feel like eating or going out, and im like bored but anxious.  i know its not even that long, but i get teary when i think about it.
im such a loser, thus im going to krissys in a little while.  hopefully i will not act like this for the rest of the week.
i really want to enjoy time with my friends, but i miss him so much.
blah.

anyway, i hope you all are making the most of your last month of summer.  

LOVE-

it just so happens that we are staying at the same hotel as last year (Princess Bayside) and that one day was most certainly the best time ive ever had.

abscence does make the heart go fonder too, i miss Jeremy.  it seems like a month since i left!

today captain lauren and i drove around and ventured into jacksonville.  i really love that girl, we have so much in common!

im still recovering from senior week part 1.  it was absolutly amazing.
i love being in the middle of a bazillion parties with no parental supervision!

well guys, i think its time for me to do some quizzes and such.  peace out.

"event","right now im eating cool ranch and regular doritos mixed.  not good.  i dont like a surprise when you reach in the bag!

this week has been pretty typical, its my last week of regular classes.  
just one more A day to go...
(and...
mon- prof. foods exam
tues- ag exam
wed- business management exam
thur- english and math)

other then that, and actual graduation, im done!!!!!!!!

saw kristina and adam at highs, havent seen her in awhile. goodtimes,  i love her.

jeremy was also at highs all night, minus the 2 hours he spent making my chicken nuggets cold.  things are getting easier.  <having a boyfriend, that is.
i really do like him, its really weird being able to completly depend on someone everyday.  kinda scary too. he says hes coming to senior week with me...to make sure i dont do anything stupid.  hahah, me do something stupid?

how do you know the difference between lust, like and love?

chris got fired from highs too, which sucks, because i only worked there because jeremy worked so close and chris worked there...now they are both fired!  i really dont like it either, other then seeing errbody.  i dont mind working during the day, but i HATE working at night by myself.  sketches me out.  i kinda wanna quit, and work at the k-town tanning salon!  ...but for now, i guess ill stick to highs, i need senior week money!

well since its my last day in orlando's, hes making me staple papers (of course), so i better start, or ill be here all day.

ttyl

happy senior year for all you seniors!

hope you all have a good day!

my dad leaves for Texas tomorrow, i cant believe hes moving.  im never going to see him anymore.
i also havent talked to krissy in awhile.  i still love you kristina.
next weeks work schedule isnt nearly as crazy...
it was wierd not seeing jeremy today too, ive seen him everyday straight for like a month.  we will be going out 2 months on next wednesday!  
its crazy having a boyfriend, hes like my first real boyfriend.
i hope i dont get really attached and then get fucked over.
i really, really like him.

"event","this weekend was pretty fun, starting on wednesday (for me)...
i didnt go to school wed. because it was 420.  i went to take my entrance exam for HCC and then went to Jeremy's.  (im in basic english and fundamentals of math)
thursday i stayed home...till like 11, then went to jeremys.  then went to the barn and rode, and slept at krissys.
friday- krissy, adam and i chose not to go to school.  insted, we spent the day at my house...random, huh?

friday night was beat, i hung out with the stoner boys briefly...and krissy for awhile.
saturday morning we left for Culpeper, VA for the Commonweath Horse Park show (double A)
on the way, we had a trailer accident.  lynn hit the only van in a vacant church parking lot.
krissy got a second and a fifth over fences saturday.
saturday night we got our own hotel room.  and baked it.
we also ate at a pretty fancy restaurant, and stuck normsie with the bill.

sunday- we got up early, and i drove the truck to the horse show with krissy.  she schooled, then we ate and left.  somehow managing to get gas and look for a vanilla blunt wrap on the way home. (with lynns money, of course.) (kristina and i had ABSOLUTLY NO MONEY ALL WEEKEND)
we went back to sleep, then back to the show.
krissy got first and third over fences, sixth in the hack and reserve champion for the older childrens.
blondie was a pimp.
she also got third, and won money, in the marshall and sterling childrens hunter classic (she only lost by 3 points)

the way home was also an adventure.  we played cell phone future telling games. (dont ask!)

we are job searching today.  im spplying at fork deli and fork High's.
i need a job so i can buy a puppy.  im getting a black and white jack russell, and naming it Hustler.
it will accompany us to horse shows =)

class is almost over, so i have to go...9 B days and 10 A days left!
senior year is so easy.
i just got my report card too ( d's and e's)
i never go to school anymore.

well guys, i think i need to go.  see you all around.

i took my HCC enterance exam today.  you may ask what inspires someone like me to take a very important test today, but i dont know.  so now im in special-ed math and english! (but college level reading!)

apparently krissy is over me, well at least right now.  hmm.  hopefully this summer will be LYNNS, SWIMMING and PONIES...i do have my priorities straight.  also stacey ended up with dan tonight, and jeremy is at work.  ironically enough, this is the earliest ive been home all week.

i have an english paper and foods project due tomorrow, and i dont think im doing either.  either way im grad. and i already have my classes together for college...

so ive heard these are the easiest months of my entire life, and i intend on appreciating them.

"event","i was gonna myself some food, but then i got high,
i was gonna ride yesterday, but then i got high,
i was gonna get my shit together for school,
but then i got high,
im writing this exhilerating journal entry, and i know why...
because i got high, because i got high, because i got high...

uh huh.

break was fun, didnt really do anything.  adam ranlett is a funny kid, krissys skirt thinks otherwise!
spent alot of time in kingsville with the stoner boys.
thursday is my birthday and im super happy.  not because im 18 (scary, huh?), but because i get money.

tilly is also wonderful!

but now its storming and i have to shut this thing down.  peace out yo."

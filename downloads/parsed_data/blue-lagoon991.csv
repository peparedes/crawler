"event","Don't you just love an uplifting film, that really touches you, and warms your heart. i know i read into this kind of things too much, but it just makes you think that your not alone, and that other people are experiencing what you are. And reality bluntly hits you in the face. Like the fact that you've been so blind as to even start to think you still like someone, when it's blatantly obvious that you should move on, and realise the guy is a prick. Even though half the time the people in the film are probably double your age, amazingly beautiful, along with lots of money, i cant help but feel like they understand, and not only does it help.. but it's frustrating. To know that in the end they can find a way out of all the mess and confusion, leaving you all entwined in the same mess they got out of. its hard to follow their path, and way out. But slowly by the end of the film you can see a way, it helps and makes you realise you are free and can let go.

"event","i know at the moment all i seem to be doing is post messages about love. But for some reason, that is all i feel i can truley talk about with confidence, becuase it makes sense. Things seem so clear at the moment, and my heart feels full to the brim, but i really don't understadn why. things just seem to be going well at the moment and im so glad of that. so if i post more random messages about love, just see them as me producing a brainstorm, to try and get to the bottom of why my hearts so full.... xxxx"

"event","love might be just around the corner, but some time soon it will hit you hard in the face, well heart. old flames may still exist and own a part of you heart, but life goes on, and they will slowly fade. Even though at times it may seem impossible, soon they will seem a million miles away and no longer bother you. Being friends with him may also seem impossible, but it is doable. So don't just give up. Don't let those old flames hold you back, because its more than likely they are moving on faster than you. So let yourself go and see who is hiding behind that corner, and be ready for them.  xxx"

"event","what is love...

Someone once told me never to give into love, but all I ever want to do is let myself go and feel like there's someone in the world that is so special that i would do anything for them.
 But there are demans, deamans that will hurt you and appear as if from nowhere, sometiems the most unlikly situation may occour, and this is when you feel like you want to run away and hide. But thats not right, you shouldn't have to hide away from love. Maybe you just shouldn't let yourself go in the first place to let yourself get hurt, that way you can still love but not feel so much that if he hurts you, or feel like your world has come crashing down on you.

I know i could ignore my heart anytime i wanted, yet that is something i will never do. Instead my heart speaks before my mind thinks, and for me that will always be the case, my heart is stronger than anything else, but at times i am too affraid to use it. Call me a sad old romantic if you want. Any boy i ever love will know that that is so, regardlress of whether i stand alone. As humans, love is the best that we do and for my part i will never overlook what my heart tells me.

You are mistaken if you believe love to be a list of the subliminal, love is a friendship with demons, a friendship on fire. 

So if anyone ever feels troubled or hurt about love just know that you're not alone xxx"

"event","Anyway, after that whole what do i do with my life matter, iv seen past the situation. The teachers aren't actually as bad as i thought, the people in my classes are actually shutting up, because they want to get a good GCSE.
      Well, next problem, what the hell do i want to do when i'm older, everyone else seems to know, and we're only in year 10! I haven't even really thought about it, but then when i do.. what the hell could i do with my life? Anything i think that i would love to do (i.e art) wouldn't really pay much. So im kinda stuck. But i guess i shouldn't really be worrying just yet. 

So yeah everythings seems to be going ok so far, no arguments, schools ok, n things with mates are sorted. Sorted!!

"event","heyloo out there !! it's so frustrating when you are excited about somethin and then all of a sudden that excitment is taken away from you and replaced with sadness. I was soo looking forward to school for once, seeing everybody ,getting new teachers, i thought it would be really fun. Instead im stuck with crap teachers, groups with loads of idiots in, (which im hoping won't ruin my chanced in getting good grades) and im just generally fed up and worried. I've also got art tomorrow for the first time, with a teacher who really hates me. My homework i was supposed to do is rubbish and im scared that people at school in my class with laugh at me n my teacher wil put my down in sets when they come to doing it. I know i could have done better, i just needed some help. And know i can't change any of it, and it looks really crap. So generally school life is horrible, not to mension people already falling out with me and Emily on the first day! We didnt even do anything wrong, people always get hte wrong end of the stick, like chinese whispers, and then you get judged for being someone you're not,i just wish everything will be like last year. I dont think anything will ever be the same. Im worried with the fact that Emily and i won't be best friends by the end of this year seeing as we dont have hardly any lessons together, therefore we wont see each other as much. Its just one pile of  problems, one on top of the other and i feel helpless. What do i do??

"event","<font color=""#0000ff"" size=""3""><strong>don't you find it really annoying when men (young, middle aged, or old) whistle or look at woman in an unpleasant way. Well join the club. <br />I figured out, while i was walking up Clanence road, that men in cars or men in a group will whistle but when they are on their own walking on the other side of the road they wont do anything. I guess that it's because when they are in a group the make you feel small and they think they could do anything, and if they're in a car they feel dominant becasue they feel protected by it. But when they are ont their own they are in the same position as the woman and avoid it as they are no longer the dominant one. <br /><br />I also found out that all men are perves! <br /><br />if u wish to comment to this please do because i'm fed up of it!!! <br /><br />xx blue_lagoon xx</strong></font>"

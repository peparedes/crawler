"event","My volunteer. You come to bleed for me. To be the vessel upon which I vent my pain and anger. All the hatred, all the viciousness that I can no longer contain I will now mark upon your flesh.
For this I love you without constraint.
This <i>he</i> cannot comprehend as he kneels in front of you.
I will lace your back with rivulets of blood from my blows.
He will draw you into his mouth, taking in your release from my pain.
And that is how it must end.
For my pleasure.
My delight and ecstasy."

"event","It was a rough weekend for emotions. I don't want this baggage, really. 

Consider this my storage shed. 

I am who I am, and without all this nonsense I don't know what would hold me together. And I need to see it sometimes. Just not all the time. Yeah, the past is real. And so is the present. And some days I do open up a metaphysical vein just to feel the pain and watch the crimson. That's the darkness in my nature. It has to scream. And if I let it, I am allowed a bit of peace in between.

The days that others open up the wounds, I am less forgiving of the pain. Those cuts last longer, and I resent them. I have to find a way to start a healing bitch for those."

Well, everywhere I want to go, there's a damn bridge that's broken..so I have to find a round-about way to get to Atsion Road before Sara gets back from Myrtle Beach because I have big an <b>AWESOME</b> plan..and also because I can't wait an entire freaking month for the bridge to be fixed..by then the summer'll be almost over. That is <i>awful</i> to think about. I don't <b>WANNA</b> go back to school. Yuck! Anyway..

I've been grounded for a few days because my sister & brother in law got me in a little bit of trouble, accidently. :-X ..Not that there's been much to do anyway since I can't go anywhere.. My mom's still upset with me. Oh well, she'll get over it. They're home until next Friday, and I have to work like EVERY day. I have to work Saturday, Monday, and then Wednesday-Friday. What make me mad is that I wasn't <b>suppose</b> to work Monday, but apparently now I have to. Blah. So Tuesday I think I'm going down the shore with them. Whooot! Saturday night there's a carnival..gotta find someone to bring with me..

I got my first paycheck yesterday. I worked 30 hours and got $165. Seems like it's not that much, haha. But it's something, so that's good. 

Summer's going by too quickly, and I don't like it! It's almost the middle of July. Yuck. 

..On a side note, this computer won't load AIM Express..how annoying. 

I can't wait til tomorrow is over. THREE DAYS IN A ROW OFF..whoo! I work Thursday and my sister & brother in law come home for a couple days, but I have to work Thursday & Saturday..possibly Sunday. Haha. Not cool.

Not sure if my brother is coming home now. :o( He says he doesn't wanna deal with my dad. That makes two of us. 

Anyway, I don't really have much I feel like writing about in here. Just figured I'd update since I have nothing better to do right now..

It seems like the only time I write in here lately is when I'm upset. I haven't written for a while, which means I've been happy..but right now I can't even describe what I'm feeling. :o/ Lonely, upset, frustrated, confused, jelous, and alone are a few words..I was fine up until an hour ago. I was having a good day. Now I can't stop crying. I wanna talk to Sara. I hate complaining to people..I feel like a lot of people are angry at me for something. I just..wanna go to sleep and forget. And then there's things that I'm confused as hell about. I hate this feeling. I'd even talk to my mom about things at this point, but I dunno. 

My dad is on my case now..ugh. What happened to the days when everything went right? For days on end? I want happiness back in my life..but it doesn't look like I'm gonna get it.

"event","Wow, so I start work on Monday..that sucks.

So far summer has been fun. Mostly. I had to wake up yesterday at 6:00am to go get bloodwork concerning my bruises. After I got blood taken, I was sick to my stomach for a long while. It really sucked. :-X I never got sick before when I got that done. Weirddd. Then I went to get my uniforms for work. How exciting. I look like a geek..I have to wear my damn shirt tucked into my pants..I HATE IT. Ah! Anyway. Then I went to Sara's. Here comes the funny part. 

We had been planning on hanging out with Andrew yesterday..and I told Andrew I'd call him when I got to Sara's and we'd get Zach to bring us over. Well, I whip out my piece of paper with a list of phone numbers on it of people I haven't remembered yet. Andrew and Ricky happen to be next to one another on this list..hah. Well, I called Ricky established that we were gonna come to his house (Sara & I) and he was like alright..haha. (*I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS RICKY, I THOUGHT IT WAS ANDREW*)..so we go to Andrew's house..and he's not home. I WAS PISSED AS HELL..hah I thought he was standing us up. So I was kinda sad, but really aggrivated because it was hot as hell n I was just annoyed..lol so then we went back to Sara's and got bathing suits and we went to Zach's to go swimming. Then, like four hours later, we go back to Sara's and her mom said Ricky called for her. I was like, what..lol so I called Ricky (*Sara & Ricky aren't friends, so I figured he called for me..but I didn't know why*)..he was saying how I called him this morning and we talked. And I was like no we didn't talk this morning..lol and I was thinking he was either drunk or trying to confuse me. Then after like 5 minutes, he was like, ""You called and said you were gonna come over with Sara"". I DIED. I couldn't stop laughing. It all came together! Then I realized that I had left a msg on Andrew's answering machine saying how we were there and he wasn't blah blah blah..haha it was really funny. I haven't explained all of this to Andrew yet, but I will eventually. 

Hmm..so I slept over Sara's last night..it was fun. I was realllly tired tho. 

I've been doing <i>a lot</i> of thinking lately. <b>(*Yes, me <i>thinking</i>*)</b> However..I can't write about what I am thinking about in here..because it's a big secret..shh! Haha, not really, some ppl know. 

Well..I dunno wut I'm doing today..maybe hanging out with Ashley later? I dunno..but wut I do know is that I'm gonna to sleep for a little while. Bye Byes."

"event","Well..
My theory that God gives you good things, and then throws in something bad to ""test you"" has proven to be true AGAIN. My mom woke me up frantically this morning around 10:30. My Aunt Theresa had just called and informed my mom that my Uncle Eddie had gone into <i>diabetic shock</i>, which was followed by <i>kidney failure</i>. My Aunt went to wake him up around 6:00am to give him his pills, and he wouldn't wake up. My uncle is a light sleeper due to sleep apnia. So my Aunt called the ambulance..his sugar level was in the 30's..which is <b>really</b> bad. So my mom woke me up, and told me to get up and get ready because we had to go to the hospital..I started freaking out when she said <i>diabetic shock</i> because my Grandmom had been in that A LOT, and it was <b>not</b> good..and then she said <i>kidney failure</I>. My Uncle Eddie is one of my favorite Uncles. He's very sick, but he manages to stay strong and lead a some-what normal life. He has heart disease, a pacemaker, cystic fibrosis, etc. He almost died when I was in 7th grade. He was my ""sponser"" when I made confirmation..I don't want to fucking lose him. He looked okay in the hospital..he was a little shaken up, which all of us were..we were there from around 11:45-4..he had to get a bunch of tests..I hope he's gonna be ok.. :o/

Life is REALLY torturous..my Uncle Wayne just almost died because of those damn aniorisms..then he gets better, and things get better..and now my Uncle Eddie is sick and in the hospital. :o( This is awful. His daugther's baby shower is tomorrow.

Oh yes, here is some good news. My cousin Maria (another one of my uncle's daugthers..he has three) is pregnant again. This will be her third kid..tomorrow is Roxanne's baby shower..and Terry is pregnant too..but THAT is a whole nother story.

Please God, let him get better... :o/"

"event","""Seth"" has a girlfriend. And here I thought things were looking good. I'm more disappointed than I thought..but Sara said he didn't really sound enthusiastic about her..blah. He's really cute, and I really like his hair. But we have his phone number..so maybe we'll hang out. :o)

In other news, I'm getting my hair highlighted today. YAY! I just wish I could get some <i>red</i> in it too. No such luck. That's wut I get for having old fashioned parents. 

Welllll, when I accused Andrew of saying that stuff, instead of Jay, Andrew got really pissed. He was like, ""IT wasn't me! Why would I say that? Why don't you trust me?"" Blah blah blah, and then I got the, ""Fine, believe what you want."" But I believe him. Then he was kinda 'eh' to me, so I asked him if he was mad, and he was like, ""Not at all"". He's really nice..he got offended that I didn't take his word over Jay's. 

Sara & I are hanging out with Andrew at some point next week. Exhilarating.

That is all."

"event","Hm..well, let's see. Yesterday was <i>completely</i> uneventful! I slept over Sara's house Friday night..then my mom picked me up at 10 so I could go to the gym before it closed..(*it closes intensely early on Saturdays..which is DUMB*) I cleaned/vacumed/dusted my room so Sara could sleep over today..lol so I HOPE SHE'S HAPPY! Haha. That took a <i>really</i> long time..partly because my room was a disaster area, and partly because I was procrastinating. Then we went to Riviera that night..I was gonna see if I could hang out with Kat (a friend who lives around the corner from me), but then I wound up going to Babies R Us and Kohls with my mom. I LOVE BABIES R US..it makes me want a baby..lol 

So yeah, that was yesterday.

Friday was really fun..except the Andrew episode, but I talked to him yesterday and he said he doesn't even remember Friday because he was drunk off his ass..somehow I think that's a lie, but suree..we were supoose to hang out Monday, but <I>screw that</i>..I think I might only talk to him again if he IMs or talks to me in school. 

Anyway, after the Andrew crap, Sara streaked my hair pink. It was amazing while it lasted..lol

We went to Sara's dress rehersal for her dance..she is really good, from the right of the stage you can't even see my Sara because there's this really big girl in front of her. Arg! It was aggrivating..lol

Oooo, then that night we made cookie dough..we needed chocolate chips, but her mom didn't have any..so we sat there and picked the chocolate chips out of chocolate chip muffin mix..it was really intense..lol pretty funny..yet lame..lol It took forever to make, and then we wound up not eating much of it because it didn't taste right..

*Flash to Saturday* - Humungous stomach ache on my part. Haha. That's what I get for eating raw eggs.

Well, I must be going..to figure out what's going on for todayyy..my mom just got home. Bye byes!"

I gotta go to the doctor today at five to get blood taken because my legs and arms are all ridiculously bruised..not sure why. Maybe it's some vitamin or something that I'm lacking in my diet..I don't wanna get blood taken..I'm scared..lol

Spending a lot of time with Sara this weekend. Whooooo, which means we'll also chill with Andrew. I wonder what'll go down with that..hehe. Sara said that whatever goes down, she wants to be there.

-Get & maintain a job
-Save $ for my carrrrrr

I had fun yesterday & today. I love hanging out with my friends. Zach is picking me up tomorrow and we're gonna hang at Sara's..and possibly get together with Andrew. Cool?

you and me together
The storm outside, the fire is bright
And in your eyes I see
what's on my mind
You've got me wild
turned around inside
And then desire, see, is creeping
up heavy inside here
And know you feel the same way
I do now
Now let's make this an evening
Lovers for a night, lovers for tonight
Stay here with me, love, tonight
just for an evening
When we make
our passion pictures
You and me twist up
secret creatures
And we'll stay here
Tomorrow go back to being friends

Go back to being friends
But tonight let's be lovers,
We kiss and sweat
We'll turn this better thing
to the best
Of all we can offer, Just a rogue kiss
Tangled tongues and lips,
See me this way
I'm turning and turning for you
Girl, just tonight

Float away here with me
An evening just wait and see
But tomorrow go back to your man
I'm back to my world
And we're back to being friends
Wait and see me,
Tonight let's do this thing
All we are is wasting hours until the sun comes up it's all ours
On our way here
Tomorrow go back to being friends

Go back to being friends
Tonight let's be lovers, say you will
And hear me call, soft-spoken whispering love
A thing or two I have to say here
Tonight let's go all the way then
Love I'll see you,
Just for this evening
Let's strip down, trip out at this
One evening starts with a kiss
Run away

And tomorrow
back to being friends
Lovers...love...lovers
Just for tonight, one night...love you
And tomorrow say goodbye</i>

Yes, at 9:00pm..on Atsion rode which is completely dark except for the occasional blinding high beams..lol We hung out until like 10:40, then rode back to make curfew. It was cool. He's a pretty cool kid. We may be hanging out with him on Tuesday again when I go home with her. 

Eh..so then I got home and my mom told me that my Uncle Wayne got out of ICU, but he's doing badly, and they may put him back. She's most likely going to visit him, but she doesn't know if I should come because he's bad.. :o( I'm scared..I dunno wut she meant by that, and I don't think I want to know either. Knowing that you're in denial is confusing. I don't like it.

So there I was..in the basement..and I woke up..woke Sara up, called my mommy..asked if I could spend another night with the luff-ly Sara. She said yes. We discussed what clothes to bring. She brought them. I took a shower..got clean. Then Zach (Sara's sweet boyfriend) came over. I got very jelous because they are so damn cute together. I LOVE IT! I want them to get married. I will be in the wedding..wearing pink..and I will be skinny by then..yes..Zach needs to train somebody to be like him..yes, so at their wedding I will be engaged to the character that he trains. Anywho. I got off track. So Zach came over and we chilled..made Macaroni n Cheese, but not before we sorted through Sara's massive amount of laundry..I did three loads for her..cuz I love her..not many people would I do laundry for..I hate doing it..hahahah. Anywho..um, my favorite part of that was:
<i>""Sara, you can't wash belts""</i> quoted by Zach.
Haha, classic. Anyway..where was I? Then we hung out and stuff..then they disappeared so Zach could get into his McDonalds uniform..it took two to change him..hehe. I wish I had a boyfriend to get ready..haha 

Hrm. What else..

We've called various people to come over..of the male species..but Eric was like right on top of the house and couldn't find it..haah, I feel bad. Oi. Well, we called three people..one is still pending..one wasn't home..PENDING! Big word..haha..yea.

Ooooo! We did stalker-ish things..yes, yes we did.

I got pooped on twice by her bird. Yum..and I got fluffed on..whoo..

We watched a little of Stewart Little 2. It looks cute. :-p As a button.

Hmmmm..won't be in school Monday. I forgot almost. Whee. After the whole shadowing thing I believe I am hanging out with Eric. Fun stuff.

Well, I must be on my way. I LOVE MY SARA! We shall spend mucho time-o together this summer..we have big plans..big plans.

OHHHHH and I also plucked her eye brows..almost poked her eye out..but that's alright. 

Anywho. I am leaving now.

Then we got here, and debated on whether to go to the Renegade Rally, Mr. East, or Eric's. We wound up biking to Eric's which is 10 miles both ways. It was really intense..lol I was so hot, so Sara threw water on me..lots of water..haha. Then we were very lost, so we kept calling Eric..eventually his dad just came and found us. We hung out with him and stuff, and then we went to Jimmies..then we biked the rest of the way home. In front of Binkley's, I saw Jay, another guy, and two girls. He was holding hands with one girl, and they were pretty close..I was ready to cry. No matter what, I still like him, and it's ridiculous. I think he's amazing..I would do anything to be with him. :o( Then we rode the rest of the way home, and Andrew sped past us. He's a really nice kid. We chatted a bit, but he had to race home before his mom came home b/c he's grounded. We might hang out with him tomorrow night because I may sleep over Sara's tonight and tomorrow night because Sara & her mommy love me! Wahoo! I'm loveddddddddddd! Then I will be spending MORE quality time with my Sara-kins because I'm coming home with her on Tuesday..not looking forward to the bus ride because of a certain asshole, but that's okay. I found out a lot of stuff that went down while we were going out, and I'm not happy. But he's in the past, and I need to look towards better things. 

I must've burnt a lot of calories while biking today..whoo! Ten miles..but then we ate ice cream. I ruined it..oopsie..

Well, I must be on my way. Goodbye, dears. 

Ps. I feel like I got raped up the ass because I was sitting on that damn bike seat so long..COMFORTABLE AT FIRST, BUT DON'T LET IT FOOL YOU!

I used to be able to not go to school whenever I wanted (within reason) when my grades were good. So I guess it's my own fault that I can't stay home today.

Well, only twenty-four more days.

I went home with Kali yesterday..Natasha took us, and then she picked me up at 3:45 so I could get back to the school in time for my Aunt to pick me up to go to the gym. She's really nice. :o) I saw a pee-your-pants video at Kali's..I almost died..lol

I had to stay after to get extra help in Algebra b/c I currently have a 34% in it..Chris stayed with me because he's a cool kid like that. :o)..but on the way home on the late bus, Lora told me about a conversation that Steve & Karl had..I was SO PISSED OFF that if either of them were put in front of  me I would've punched them in the face. Here's a summary of it..they were talking about video taping two people having sex, and Steve said something about not being able to video tape us having sex because I was self consious, and I should be because if they (Karl or Steve) had my body they'd be self consious too. (*I'm not sure which one of them said that..I was too mad to listen*)..and then Steve said how before he met me I was bulimic, then when we started going out I got fat, and now I'm an <i>anorexic drug addict</i>. 
<b>Yeah, you better believe it!</b>
When I got home I was really upset, so I called Eric because we were suppose to hang out after school anyway. I asked him to come over. He did. I appreciated that a lot. Before I met him at the library, I stopped in at my Aunt Mary's house..she wanted to show me what she's doing to my Grandmom's old room..I hadn't been in that room since my Grandmom died. It really disturbed me..it still kinda smells like her..but she isn't there..obviously. I miss her..Anyway Eric & I hung out in the park..got a little lost..(well, I did..I didn't have any idea where I was)..Then I had to go so it wasn't sketchy that I wasn't really at the library (where my parents thought I was)..we went to the library, and who do we see coming? Chris..hah. Kinda bad timing, but that's alright. So I called my mom on Eric's cell phone, to see <i>""if the workers left""</i> (We had people in our house putting doors in, and I <i>""went to the library""</i> to <i>get away from the noise""</i>..and then my mom told me Walt was on the phone, and I got REALLY scared because of stuff that's been going on with my sister. So I attempted to run home, but it didn't really work since I was in really high flip flops. I was REALLY scared. Everything turned out to be okay..he just wanted to call and say hey, he missed me, etc..and we wound up having an hour long, very intense conversation. I always could talk to him more than I could talk to my sister because he can relate a lot more than my sister can. I love my sister though..anyway, so around 8:00, I hear my phone ring, but I couldn't get it because I was still on the phone with Walt..so after I got off of the phone with him, I checked my messages, called him back..but apparently he wasn't home yet..so I figured he was on his way back to his house..then 10 minutes later, he calls, I didn't hear the phone, but I heard the answering machine beep from the living room..but by the time I got to the machine it was too late..so I listened to the msg, and apparently he was still at the library with Chris..so I made up some bull shit excuse to go to my aunt's, and met up with him and Chris for a couple minutes. Not long, but long enough. I felt bad because I blew Chris off a little at first, lol, but I didn't mean to. Yeahhh..so I may be hanging out with Chris & Eric today, but I dunno. Maybe Kat could come over and keep Chris company..she lives like less than 200 feet from me, and we never hang out..lol that's kinda sad. I am hopefully having Nikki over on Saturday..and then we might hang out with Eric as well. Whoot.

Well, I really needa be going because I still have to do my hair & make up. Eeep! Bye!

I slept over Ashley's house Friday night. It was fun. Ricky came over around 11:45, and left around 1am. Hm..then we were asleep by 2, but I almost died when I woke up because I was so tired. Here's the first thing I heard when I woke up,

Heather (Ashley's sister): <i>""Is this a JOCK STAP or a BRA?""</i>

She was referring to my bra which was on the floor..then she goes:

<i>""YOU HAVE REALLY BIG BOOBS""</i>

Thanks, Heather..lol Then I just pulled the blankets and pillows over my head and tried to go back to sleep, but then she sat on the futon and stared at me. 

Scarey shit.

Nikki just sent me these lyrics. They remind me of Jay. I think that we're over mainly because he's moving very soon. I don't want him to go. I wish he had more confidence in himself..he's so insecure..that's probably another reason..but things he said to me..I can't stop thinking about them and it hurts because I haven't talked to him much since. He thinks I hate him, but I don't. How could I? Everytime I hear the song <I>""Yeah""</i> I nearly break into tears. This kid..has me crazy.

Anyway, here are those lyrics:

<i>If only you'd never speak to me the way that you do. 
If only you'd never speak like that. 
It's like listenin to a breaking heart, a falling sky, fire go out and friendship die. 
I wish you felt the way that I still do. 
If only you'd never look at me the way that you do.
If only you'd never look like that. 
When I look at you I see face like stone, eyes of ice, mouth so sweetly telling lies. 
I wish you felt the way that I still do, but you don't feel anymore you don't care anymore it's all gone. 
If only you'd never pull from me the way that you do. 
If only you'd never pull like that when i'm with you. 
I feel hopeless hands helplessly pulling you back close to me. If only you'd speak to me the way you once did, look at me the way you once did, pull to me the way you once did, but you don't feel anymore you don't care anymore it's all gone.</i>"

I went home with Ash yesterday, and it was mucho funo. I love my Ashy! Donny came over to Ashley's yesterday. We went to the beach, & Donny threw her flip flops in the water..it was really funny. Haha. 

Well, I'm gonna go for now. I'm on the phone with Nikki.

"event","Life has too many fucking ups and downs. I guess I deserve everything that is coming to me right now. I wish I could turn around and do shit different. Not even sure WHAT I would do different, but right now I am regretting a lot of shit. WHY AM I SO SHY? God damn..I <i>pray to God</i> that things straighten out tomorrow. Today really sucked. I feel like such a baby for crying so much today. Ridiculous. Nikki's @ Jay's right now with Kali. It's cool how my friends r friends with him, but it sucks how they see him more than I do..Pah. But hopefully this Sunday will work out. 

..Maybe he just had a bad day..

I could eat in Kentucky, and now that I'm back in Jersey I can't. What is up with this crap? I eat like two bites of something, and I feel like I'm gonna throw up. Pah. Life.

Going to the gym..bye.

I can feel a lot of regrets coming on.

To top it off, today is seven years since my Grandpop died. 

I'm wearing a skirt for the first time in like a year today..I hope my panty hose don't rip..ughhh, I'd be so pissed. 

I'm hoping that seeing <i>somebody</i> will make me feel better.

<i>So enjoy my good friends

"event","Hey. Yesterday wasn't as bad of a day as I thought it would be. Some people made it better for me. Nikki, for instance, who stayed after with me and listened to me talk for two hours..haha I don't think my Grandmom would've wanted me to sulk all day. Right? :o/ One whole year..ahh.

Then I went to the gym, worked out for the normal half hour, but added another fifteen because I had motivation..haha. Whoo! At the rate of losing 10 pounds a month, I'll be good to go by June. Whoo!! :-D While I was at the gym, I hit my head while doing my stretching or w/e, and it didn't hurt at first, but when I got home my head started to hurt, and by the time I got off the phone I think I had a migrane. My back was aching, and I felt nauseous. I feel fine now. Weird. 

I need plans for Friday night. I'm hanging out or sleeping over Kali's on Saturday and we're gonna hang out with Jay. :o) I wish my Nikki could come with Brian. Hmph...but noooo! 

Welllll, I'm out like a boner in sweat pants. (*Kali, I stole that from u, I believe..*)

"event","<center>It's time to choke back those tears.
Wipe away the tears in my eyes,
And paint a smile.

Missing you incredibly
But I shouldn't let it show.

I should be happy.
No more suffering.
No more meds.
You're free now.

You've been free for a whole year.

It's been a year since I've said, ""Gram, I love you"".
A year since I've touched you, held your hand.
A year since I've spent HOURS with you.
A year since I've heard your voice.

Standing on a mountain screaming out your name.
Screaming <i>Come back to me</i> is all I can think of.
Please come back.
I could say those three words forever,
but I'd only be wasting air.

So I'll leave in silence.
Trap it all inside.
Because I can't  let those tears show.

Too beautiful to cry?
No, then that would mean to sweet to die, Gram.

Standing on a cliff, 
<b>I LOVE YOU</b>
I know you'll keep me safe
..until I join you..

<b>I love you, Grandmom. I love you so much..and GOD KNOWS I miss u horribly. :o(</b>

<i>I'm gonna be okay. Promise</i>"

"event","Hey guys. What's going on? I just got home from Kentucky - the land of IMBREADS! Sexy, eh? Haha. It was cool to get away, and it was awesome to spend time with Chrissy & Walt. They want me to come and spend the entire summer with them. There are pluses to that, I would be able to have my liscence and I could drive their Jeep that they rarely use..I could go where-ever..and I would get a job there..and I could meet people, but I <b>can't</b> go there the whole summer. I'd go crazy missing my friends. I went crazy missing my friend while I was in Kentucky for ten days..I used up like 900 out of 1000 minutes on my phone card with just my friends..haha. That's not even MENTIONING the 5 hours a night I talked with Nikki and Jay with her free long distance.

Ohhhhh! Ashley just got here and we're gonna go chill with my people. Peace.

*~Cory~*

Tomorrow will be a year since my Grandmom died. I miss her so much. :o( 

<i><center>Last night I had a crazy dream
A wish was granted just for me,
It could be for anything
I didn't ask for money
Or a mansion in Malibu
I simply wished, for one more day with you

CHORUS
One more day
One more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again
I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still, for one more day with you

First thing I'd do, is pray for time to crawl
Then I'd unplug the telephone
And keep the tv off
I'd hold you every second
Say a million I Love You's
That's what I'd do. With one more day with you

CHORUS x2

Leave me wishing still for one more day
Leave me wishing still for one more day...
With you"

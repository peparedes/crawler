"event","today jessica and i went over to our friend andrews house and his friend mike was over. we went swimming and because we didn't have our bathing suites we had to swim in our normal clothes. those made us like so heavy so we could barly swim in the deep end. then we decided to go on a hike to this old abandoned house with a slaughter house next to it. but on the way there were these bulls in this pasture that we had to cross and we were like 20 feet away. they were soooo scary. then we tried to break into the house because no one lived there and we wanted to see the inside. well on the way back we had to go back into the pasture with all the cows, now get this, this was horrible. on the way back the cows were on the other end of this slope which divided our trail from there grazing ground. the kept following us on the other side which scared the shit out of me because i thought that they might chase us. well when our two sides met they were still comign close to us so we sped up to get back to the barb wire fence and follow it up the hill to were we could jump it. well were just about up at the top when we see the head of a cow that beat us to the top and he was like 10 feet away. this really scared me but we had to walk past it. the fence to the left and the cow to the right was freaky and because i wear HUGE baggy pants i am the ONLY one to get caught and RIP my new pants on the fence. this sucks but it was sooooo fun! then jessica and i went to in and out burger which toook FOREVER! now she is spending the night and were bored!!!
i also got a present from my cool friend mark who got me a cool hawiian necklace from his vacation."

No one would've thought I liked him, but, they thought wrong. Third period went from one extreme to the other. It used to be the loudest, and funniest class in the whole of Hunter's Creek. But now, it's dead. Even Mrs.Moore noticed! She even asked 'him' what was wrong. It was horrible, I might even resort to getting a schedule change. For some reason, I was listening to my mix from like the summer of 2003, and EVERY SONG, I mean, EVERY SONG, I had to turn off. Each one I listened to reminded me of him. This sucks. I'm trying to go on to the new guy, but it's so not working. Guess Miss Tinky's gonna have to work harder, now isn't she?"

In the morning i got yelled at, and at school i told mandy something and she swore on the CHANKLETAS that she wouldn't tell! And what happens? she tells. Ivana. Yeah. Well later that day, Adora starts talking shit about me to Victor. SO now he's even more madder at me. And while we're walking home, Desiree lest my shoebox for Ms.Covington's class open, and all my stuf flew out. EVen though Mr.True went across the street to Colonial Grande to get it (how sweet), i was still angry at her! so we went out to eat lst night, Chili's. And guess who i see? Ms effing Jones and Ms effing McGinnis.party. Then i go home where i think i can escape, and then i go online, right. And im in c chat with the usuals. And my font color is green. Nikki gets pissed and yells at me and tells me to change it and then i say NO and she gets mad again. THen later on Jose spelled something wrong so i corrected him. Eeverybody else said lol and now Nikki has to come over and yell at me and call me a ""lil gurl"" and say that i was crying about it. I was talking to Isabel, and THEN i was on the verge of crying cuz of how sucky yesterday was! and they said i was overreacting but they don't know how bad that day was. So now i know who my true friends are. Isa and MiMi. That's about it. Nikki was supposed to be one of my best friends. Nikki if you're reading this, u could of told me iw as getting on ur nerves. It seems nowadays i'll say the smallest thing and it sets you off. Youg et so pissed at me it's unbelievable. If im jsut extra baggage, just lemme know. Straight up. I'd rather u get it off your chest and ME be hurt, then let it go on, and everytime you y ell at me i get hurt even more. I think somethings wrong with me cuz since i came bck from Denver i hear that everyone thinks im a snob. I don't think im a snob but it must be cause im starting to hear it quite often. So, here's my resolution. When poeple are talking about things like, where they're going and what they're doing for Spring Break, i'll keep my mouth shut. When they're talking about buying things, i'll keep my mouth shut. WHen they're talking about guys, im going to keep my mouth shut. So basically, I have to keep my mouth shut PERIOD. Oh well, it's for the best. Wish me luck with my new tactic.

I don't know what it is that you've done to me 
But it's caused to me act in such a crazy way 
Whatever it is that you do, when you do what you doing 
It's a feeling that I want to stay 

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time 
With thoughts of lovin' you on my mind 
I can't figure out just what to do 
When the cause and cure is you, you

[chorus]
I get so weak in the knees 
I can hardly speak 
I lose all control (control) 
Then somethin' takes over me 
In a daze, your love's so amazing 
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me 
By my side, I swallow my pride 
Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off of my feet 
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak 

Time after time after time I've tried to fight it 
But your love is strong, it keeps on holdin' on 
Resistance is down when you're around, pride's fading 
In my condition I don't want to be alone 

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time 
With thoughts of loving you on my mind 
I can't figure out just what to do 
When the cause and cure is you, you 

I get so weak in the knees 
I can hardly speak 
I lose all control (control) 
then somethin' takes over me 
(Takes over me) 
In a daze, your love's so amazing 
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me 
By my side, I swallow my pride 
Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off of my feet 
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak 
(Makes me weak) 

Yeah 
I try hard to fight it 
No way can I deny it 
Your love's so sweet 
Knocks me off my feet 

I get so weak in the knees 
I can hardly speak 
I lose all control (cotrol) 
then somethin' takes over me (takes over me) 
In a daze, your love's so amazing 
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me 
By my side, I swallow my pride 
Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off of my feet 
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak 

I get so weak 
Blood starts racin' through my veins 
I get so weak 
Boy, it's somethin' I can't explain 
I get so weak 
Somethin' 'bout the way you do 
The things you do 
it Knocks me right off of my feet 
(Oh, off my feet) 
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak 
(I get so...) 

I get so weak in the knees 
I can hardly speak 
I lose all control 
then somethin' takes over me 
(I lose control, takes over me) 
In a daze, your love's so amazing 
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me 
By my side, I swallow my pride 
Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off of my feet 
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

That movie is really deep, but now i know for a fact he is NOT dead cuz here lemme tell u !!  On the night of his death, he went 2 a Mike Tyson fight and got in a fight with a gang member. And that would make it a felony of assasult rite? And in Cali, they have a law called 3 strikes, meaning, that if u commit 3 felonies, u get 70 to life in prison! Well, Tupac had 2 strikes already, so he knew that the po-po's would throw him in jail after that fight, which was unintentional. So that same night, he hired some people to stage his death, so he wouldnt get thrown in prison. His mom had a 2 million $ insurance policy so if he were ever 2 die, she would get 2 mil. but when he supposedly died shenever cashed in, wouldnt u cash it in? and at the beginning of tghe movie he is talking about his own death , he was like ""i got shot in vegas, eveyr1 wa shooting at teh same time, but hey, every1 is meant 2 die""! c thats a usless piece of information 4 ya!!! well we watched that, and then watched bad boyz 2  while my sis was beating me with a friggin dog leash, wa t a wierdo!! some times i wonder y were related......

"event","hey katie I really want u 2 read this. im really disapointed in u for all of the things u wrote in her survey. yur mah gurl and evrything but ur still messed up 4 that. Please dont make yur last few weeks here a living hell. U dont wanna come bac here to vist and have a bad reputation 4 starting stuf with people do u? Well I have a feeling courtneys gonna b really popular next yr, so if u DO ever come bac, make sure u dont mess around wit her because just remember i got her back. And I know i said i aint picking sides, but i think im on courtneys this time, u really need 2 think about wut u wrote in that because m really mad. And if your gonna say that type of stuf, go rite ahead but make sure u just dont do it on the internet to where everyone who has access 2 a computer can see it. At least have the common courtesy to call her, or write an email, or send an IM or soething, cuz that ish was grimey. And u can b mad or w/e your mood is at that moment, because u r one of the biggest dram queens i have ever met, but just tell me wut u think about this. And dont come online trying 2 start n e thing withy me because i have better stuf 2 do then listen 2 u yap on about your horrible life and how u cant take it n e more and blah blah blah. OK, stop being so dramatic and look at the real world, OK? Because when u go 2 high school, people arent going to b as nice as courtney ans sydney, they r going to jump u , so just remember I warned you. And go ahead, talk about me behind my back, and call me a fat botch and an ugly hoe, and a whore and all this, but personally i dont care because its your problem if you have 2 stoop down lower than u already are and talk about other human beings like that. And I hope u know, u arent going to have many freinds when u leave Florida."

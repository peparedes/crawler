"event","letting go of shit that holds you down is, needless to say, so relieving. it's so strange how the things you depended on so much for meaning in the past become so easy to give up when you get to a new place in your life and realize how terribly destructive they are/were. things you never thought you let go of. things you kept inside and held onto and danced around, things you would never disclose to anyone for fear of being told to let go. because you knew all along that you would have to, and to hear it from someone else just makes it that much more real and terrifying to accept as the truth. you truly are only as sick as your secrets. honesty is so powerful and so comforting in all its fearful vulnerability. learning something important and not applying it to your life is the same as never having learned it at all, and once you have been so enlightened, to ignore it only leads to more ignorance and resentment for knowing full well that you know better. 

school is going well. i'm on my way to becoming a damn good welder and i'm truly proud of it. i brought home my first example of the work i've been doing and the skill i've been learning the other day, and as it sits on my dresser i feel more like a person than before it was there. purpose is a very empowering and affirming asset to life. i don't know how i ever dealt without it. oh wait..yes i do know. i didn't. i couldn't. people became my purpose and that made me sicker than any drug, any hangover, any abuse or self-loathing/destruction ever did or could. purpose gives you autonomy and identity. it's every bit as necessary for life as death is in that they both give importance and meaning to time. i have lost many things but built newer, better ones in their place and i am happier and better off for it."

"event","i'm not too good at keeping track of this shit or updating regularly, but i do the best i can. it's not like i have the internet at my disposal whenever the whim strikes me to use it, i usually have to battle my way through a hoard of email-starved and fantasy-football-hungry recovering addicts and alcoholics. we all pretend to be nice and patient with each other, but take more than 30 seconds after being asked, and you know what we're all thinking: ""hurry the fuck up you selfish prick."" so i managed to skip grief and loss group (doesn't that sound like so much fun?) and snagged the computer. here's the skinny on what's goin on with me. i'm starting cosmetology school so i can get my hair stylist license on Aug 23 here in FL. it takes about a year, and in that time i'll be traveling back and forth now and then to visit. after that, i'm getting a job and working to save money so i can go to art school, considering my parents spent all my college money on sending me to rehab. what a super trade-off, don't you think? 

i have 115 days clean as of today, and it really doesn't feel like it's been that long. i don't even think about shit anymore, it's quite odd. i've realized how life is actually really good even when it's bad. you use drugs and get wasted so you can numb yourself from whatever problems you're having, which were probably not that bad to begin with, and end up in a hole 3 feet from hell wondering where you started in the first place and why. if you can be happy sober with no repurcushions, then why be a tiny bit happier fucked up and end up miserable, panicked, hung over, in jail, kicked out, or bored beyond bearing after? it has just ceased to make sense to me. for those of you getting clean or even trying to clean house a little, good for you. most of this shit is just stuff we have to outgrow anyway. so get on with your life. you may question why i went to rehab when i was one of the lesser abusers of our little bunch. to get away from the lifestyle, or lack thereof. that's what was killing me. i couldn't get my head out of the fucking gutter long enough to see what street i was on. this was the best decision i've ever made so far. remember people: hope not dope. hugs not drugs. call me 210 355 1136.

so i got my car last week. that was the most exciting thing that's happened to me in 3 1/2 months. it's very peculiar to have a little freedom after spending these last months cooped up like a chicken on an egg farm. controlled, monitored, questioned, tested, poked, and prodded. it's almost kind of scary. the last time i had freedom i fucked myself over royally, and now i'm driving this car, an item possessed with memories of home and of all of you, around in an entirely different state and new environment. i know the area well and i like it, but i've never driven in another state before. it's just trippy.

i'm coming to visit on thursday until sunday. i'd like to see whoever would bother making time enough to see me. so please let me know. my time is very short so i have to make the most of it.

i love and miss you guys. i'm still here, walking, talking and breathing. call me because i'm pretty fucking busy all the time and it's hard to call you."

"event","so it's been eons since i've bothered with this expose of sorts. i feel so vulnerable...as if i don't deal with that enough being in treatment. 3 some-odd months in fucking therapy, jesus it gets old. i've been told so many contradictory things that i don't know what to think about my own thoughts. but i've got 91 days with no chemicals inside my body, save nicotine, caffiene and behavior pills, but hey, that's a start. i've been working out like it's my religion, if i were a devout follower of any sort of religion. i've decided that i've hated and neglected my body for so much of my life that it's time to start doing the opposite of what's gotten me nowhere. now it's like my own little personal temple and i'm trying to take care of it as best as my brain and my willpower will allow for once. much of life is really matter over mind really, you know? when your mind's fucked up and tells you to do things that it knows are terribly wrong, you learn to trust what your told is right by extraneous sources, and eventually, it starts to get trained to do things somewhere inbetween. or at least think about it more. i'm tired as all fucking get out."

i think i'm going to become an alcoholic. i'm not saying that i aspire to become one, just that it will probably end up that way. beer = numbness = temporary happiness. that's really the best i can get right now. most, if not all, things are ""tragic and temporary"" anyway. happiness is very hard to come by but the beer is cheap and plentiful. 

so last night was get drunk night at the twins. ash, james, riley, justin, b + b, myself and alissa kicked it. imagine my surprise when kayla shows up around 12:30. it's so strange to be totally caught off guard when someone you're used to being so close to comes around on someone else's behalf. it hurt, actually, a lot. talking to her felt foreign to me, like she was not the same person i had spoken to, say, a few days ago. i realized though that the only thing that's becoming any different is me.

88. as far as the rest of the weekend went, we met some of britt's friends, who were all lesbians, saw ""cellular"" (which was a strange but mildly entertaining film about some kid who has to save this total stranger's life and the lives of her family with only the help of a cell phone), and i rode a mechanical bull. yes. i did. it was amazing. also, i stopped twice and visited josh in killeen. oh...and i left two brand new pairs of expensive jeans in a dryer at UNT. way to go mel.

i was born with a silver-plated spoon in my mouth
for the sake of saying i've known less
i've got no work ethic because i've never had to work
for a day or a thing in my life
but i was raised to love someone
for nothing more than their mere existance
and to give them everything
for nothing more than that love
and so that's how i loved you
and now in the aftermath of the explosion
that i so lovingly deem these past two days
i'm surrounded by good friends
but feel utterly lonely nonethless
without your comfortable memory
to sit beside me
my brain is wracked with the thought
that maybe, just maybe, i hurt you
and how that makes me hate myself that much more
than i already did for being unlovable to you
and now i don't want to sleep
because i'll just dream about you
and i never want to wake up
because the reality of this heart attack 
is no easier to cope with
should we even be fighting over things
that neither of us can control?
should i be apologizing for loving you too much?
should any of this have ever happened at all?
i've concluded the answer is no
and the fault for the catastrophe
lies squarely on my shoulders
i'm sitting here in my cold awkward home
that i don't know well enough to call home as it is
typing my heart out on this screen
wondering if you'll even bother to read this far
and all it'll translate to is numbers and codes 
that'll translate into words 
that you'll translate into meaning
and if you get any at all i hope it's this
i'm sorry for the cycles i can't break
i'm sorry for the flaws i can't fix
i'm sorry for the faults i can't accept
i'm sorry for a million things
i probably shouldn't apologize for
but i'm sorry anyway
i'm sorry i can't not love you
and i'm sorry if i hurt you
but sorry's just a word 
and maybe if i'm lucky 
you'll take it for what it really means
i warned you about the monster that lives in my chest
and at least i never told told you any different
at least you never had to worry whether or not i cared
because i always did, and i still do, and i still will
i can't help that
and i don't think you'd want me to even if i could
i brought this all on myself
and what's worse, i brought it on you too

you said you never thought i would
i said i didn't either but i did
just forgive me
and pretend this never happened
like we always are so good at doing"

and for this gift
she's likely to go,
or so she'll say
We sleep as we do to keep our nights days away
Love,
or so she'll say
Immature love
You breed immature love
So died the virgin
I have told you before,
You we're nothing special to him
(but that's nothing new for you).
You'll be born
You before
Embody me with your body
I've never seen it
I have never
Embody me with your body
I've never seen it
Are you happy?"

"event","74. how do you know at 19 when the possibility that something will work for you has run out? how the hell am i supposed to know what i want from this life or where the fuck i'm going? the only direction i know to take is one that leads me in circles. i'm confused - but i'm starting to remember why i don't want to go to college. i'm not made for it. there just...isn't really any other way these days for someone to get by most of the time without a degree in something. my mom, god bless her, knows where i'm coming from, but my father is far too traditional and security-oriented to understand my dilemma. he wants me to go to a 4 year university, go through all the bullshit, and get me a degree in something that i'll end up hating (mid-life crisis time) or that will make me dirt poor. everything in my life has been handed to me, whether through love, compassion, luck, or my own devices. i hardly know what work is, let alone how to do it without getting so distracted i can't think or so annoyed i want to die. i just float around to whatever holds my attention at the time. i'm just praying for something to come along and rescue me from college. 

75. i've had a bunch of people (strangers, mind you) tell me that i look really familiar. this one girl at exxon told me i look exactly like her best friend, hair and all. she says i sound like her too. i was like man wtf. people look like this? whatever, man. it's kind of creepy - that's never in my life happened before like it has been lately. people need to stop jacking my style and shit, goddamn it. its not even a particularly good one.

"event","73. incubus: possibly one of the best nights of my short existance to this point. they were unmotherfuckingbelievable. that's the only way to describe the awesomeness of that concert. kayla bought me a shirt that was more overpriced than abercrombie and fitch and we shared our cigarettes (which we bummed off two total strangers to begin with) with a nice outwardly lesbian couple. some dumb chick yelled ""deftones suck!"" at kayla's hoody as we passed them. i thought heads were gonna roll. luckily she didn't catch the insult until i brought it to her attention once we were safely out of conflict's way. there were a lot of stupid annoying trendy kids there, but what else can one expect, i suppose. i hate going to concerts for that one reason - everyone under the age of 21 thinks they're cool as shit because they're there, and they want everyone to know that they're just a little bit cooler than everyone else. it's really stupid. it makes me feel like i'm being judged by almost every person i pass. also, we sat in front of these two annoying 12 year old boys who came with their mommy and screamed like little girls. yeah. oh and sparta didn't play. i don't know what's up with that. whatever. regardless of all the minor nonsense, it was a damn, damn good time."

70. smoke break with ashley. we talked about furniture and how i thought it would be cool if there was a country whose specialty was making mattresses, like the cubans are with cigars or the swedish and their cell phones. i know, i'm strange.

71. i had a moment of introspection again today - taking into account i have no shame in admitting my short-comings - i'm manipulative, spoiled, greedy, and i take things for granted. (i also have a problem with guilt/self-blame..) but, on the other hand, i am usually very generous when i can be (often) and i go out of my way for people a lot. at least i try to ""give back"" on some level. it's difficult to correct the flaws you're born or raised with. it's easier to try and balance them out. i also realized that i'm extremely good at making connections. and i mean with anything. it's always been easy for me to understand how or why something works or happens or turns out a certain way, etc. if i could find out how i could make a living doing something that utilizes that, i'd be set.

"event","67. this love is like hot lead in my chest
aged to perfection with years of starvation
regret and depress
the time and the friction
has turned me from particles to glass
the sum of countless pieces
no stronger but together
you'd never bat an eye at the transition.
instead you grin so smugly
as you watch me, like melting putty
slip around your loosely clenched fingers
you disregard me
my self-control
and you hate to assume
but you assume nonetheless
that this love never runs out
just in circles like blood -
you should've met me when i was younger
when my heart was softer
by now my blood runs thin 
like water out of my chest
sooner or later i'll be all tapped out
and you'll wonder where i am.
you hate to assume
but you'll assume nonetheless
that all i've said before means nothing
but let me reassure you
i'm only bitter because i still feel
i'm only bitter because i love you.

fuck the love
fuck the bitterness
i'll go numb.
my heart was at your disposal
and that's exactly what you've done with it.

No need to remember

42. people are totally irrational and insane. i spent almost an entire car trip from austin to san antonio to the soundtrack of a one-ended screaming, bitching lover's quarrel. i noticed that the same issues were repeated for about, say, an hour or so, and it made me realize how terribly trite it all is. (maybe everything is tragic and temporary) enjoy life, for god's sake. you only get one, although that concept still escapes our youthful judgement. things like love are not meant to drag you down, they're meant to keep you standing, goddamnit. and if something like love is dragging you down, you're better off cutting it  loose and being sad for a few months than you are heartbroken and hanging by your neck from a ceiling fan in your living room over some girl/boy (that's a true story i heard from my friend danna's dad. he's a pleasant guy.). we'll say the average teenage relationship lasts around 6 months and the average teenager involved is around 17. *calculating...* ok, so at 17 you've been around for about 204 months, and so 6 months out of that is approximately 1/34 of your lifespan, and that's only to that very moment in time. basically, you've survived somehow through several other previous tribulations, so freaking out over a fantastically small amount of time (relatively speaking) is....oh fuck it. no one's going to bother to read this far anyway. and for those of you who did, i give up. trying to explain love to a kid is like trying to explain color to a blind person. 

43. i need to start taking better care of myself. i get a head rush from getting out of the car, it's ridiculous. don't even mention the fucking stairs. my smoker's lungs can't handle that. plus i rarely eat and sleep irregularly and am basically powered by drugs of different sorts and whatever whim happens to strike my easily distracted mind. i need to cut back on the smoking, all varieties of plant matter included. then of course there's the whole schedule thing...i need to get myself on some sort of clock. eating comes with that, but i can't even remember what ""eating right"" is. something about vegetables and nonsense like that. who fucking knows. and lastly i gotta try to walk down to the gym like, maybe 3 times a week. it's like 100 yards away, i'm just always stoned and lazy. it'd be nice to have someone to go with. who would hide the weed or something until after we went. like a reward, haha. ""mel, you know you can't smoke a blunt until after you finish on that damn stairmaster. it's only the warmup, come on."" 

44. today was nuts. original plans of getting a tattoo with josh were scrapped and we went to austin instead to visit brittney's (or jessie, as she's known there) friends. and wow. some friends they were. i was lost in a world of piss drunk flaming gay guys who ""loved my hair"" or lesbians............holy shit......i can't type anymore.my limbs and eyes are revolting......damn you body...to hell.."

32. it's time for me to figure out what i'm going to do with my damn life. it became apparent to me in astronomy class today that i am terrible at math, but incredibly good at geometry. it comes naturally to me - i guess you could say it's one of those things that just sort of clicks in my head with very very little effort on my part. so i've been trying to narrow down my vast range of interests into something more feasible as a major/possible career. you can't be an ""everything"" major. and i'm pretty sure sitting around and smoking pot can't turn into a career - at least in this country. i wish. *sighs* goddamn the indecisiveness of youth. sometimes having a lot of totally different options is more difficult than having none. there is such a thing as too many choices.

28. i've noticed lately that i rarely use the sidewalks and walkways at school. i usually cut across the grass. i wonder if there's some psychological thing behind that.

29. people during this age really suck. all we're really good at is being totally inept at almost everything we think we've got figured out. we know what's important usually, we just lack the knowledge, skills, qualifications, maturity, will power, work ethic, and sense of time and reality to obtain it. most of the time. i guess that would come naturally, considering most of us are smack in the middle of leaving childhood and entering some sort of ""adult"" world. i figure as long as i assume that i know extemely little about the way things work, i'll be ok. at least then i'll try to learn."

21. i've been quietly thinking about my definition of love lately. i concluded this evening, with some margin of error inferred, that i have probably only truly been in love with one person. i got real close with another, but time and experience have taught me how to back myself off and put up my thicker skin. i'd rather be bitter and withdrawn than heartbroken. 

22. there are not enough undisturbed hours in the day for all the things i wish i had time to do. 

23. the fact that my birthday is this weekend now officially sucks. at least there's further. 

24. i really want to open my own record store someday. that would be one of the best things ever. 

25. i'm wearing superman underwear. and you know what? i feel super."

"event","17. i have this theory that the reason utsa makes parking lots that are far too small for its extremely large, mostly commuter student body is so the campus po can hand out small, frivolous parking tickets to everyone they possibly can. all the faculty/staff lots are never even close to full, but alas, we, the lowly students, have no right to park there. i took a cue from another car earlier and parked in a strip of white lines outlining a row of parking spots. and in under an hour, i had a $20 parking ticket under my windshield wiper. you don't want people to park where there's no parking? then make a big enough parking lot. jackasses.

18. *sings mockingly* i get to go see incubuuuuussss.

19. i'm instating a curfew for myself of 11:30. i've missed class because i've been too tired and lazy to haul myself out of bed. this must end. plus i need to do shit that i never get done because i'm always out doing something, usually it's nothing good. so on weeknights, my door and my taxi service closes at 11:30."

"event","12. i met my neighbors, marcy and...shit i can't remember the other one's name. oh well. at any rate, they're both nice friendly girls from austin who smoke pot and hate rude people. they complain that my roommates are rude due to an incident involving trash and to whom it truely belonged. unbeknownst still to this moment to all parties involved, I am the true culprit of the whole fiasco. i was simply following suit with what i had seen around me, no one had told me any differently. in order to put an end to the nonsense and also keep my real identity safely concealed, i carried the trash down the stairs under the cover of darkness.

13. minus the bear is a great band.

14. my birthday is on sunday. 19. you should get me a present. ;)

15. liars don't make good friends. ever.

16. i really like school. it actually makes me happy. i'm enjoying the vast majority of my life quite a bit. i feel that i'm going somewhere, even if i have no clue where my destination might end up being. i've always felt that the means are more important than the ends. you don't stop moving and changing until you die. so fuck the ends. the means are the life you live."

"event","5. sitting outside of josh's house in killeen today, it occured to me for the first time (granted it was also the first opportunity i would have to think about this particular situation at all) what a strange combination bagpipes and purple lightning storms are. it almost felt as if i were at my own funeral or something. if i were irish. but alas - i'm not.

6. i'm drunk.

7. there's a big, dark, odd looking bruise on the inside of my right bicep that has been growing uglier the past few days. i have no ideas as to its origin, though it has been something that i have pondered frequently.

8. i'm not terribly sure, but i think that some preppy bitch scoffed at me on the way to my room tonight. i imagined myself 

FORCIBLY INSERTING MY ELBOW INTO HER MOUTH

and then laughing. i mean it's possible that i'm just paranoid and she just coughed or some shit, but due to the stigma of her stereotype (which she fit just perfectly), it's difficult for me to believe that's the case. more importantly, i wonder why i give a shit.

9. i'm enjoying my new living situation. i just wish i had some kool-aid. *tear*

10.  don't let the title and pictures fool you: ""same sex parents"" is NOT an entertaining movie.

"event","1. moved into dorm room at utsa. it's a really nice place, but two of my three roommates, based upon first impression, seem pretty square. the other one, who happens to be on the cute side, seems a little less anti-social/school-minded. the two squares deadbolted the door so i, after stumbling up the stairs at 2am, stand, pace, and quietly freak out about what this particular situation required in order to be taken care of. and even more so about how nothing would be able to done until the morning. luckily my friendlier roommate happened to run up the stairs a few moments later. after passing me for a kid on the stairs, i notice her heading towards my door and quickly introduce myself as another occupant of the room she was trying to enter. we shook hands (this being our first meeting) and she flashed a smile that slightly caught my eye for a moment. she knocked, and we were let inside. i'm still working on setting up all my nonsense, but i feel relatively comfortable here. this will be good for me. i need to surround myself with something new and, well, related to the rest of my life.

2. got a new computer. apple powerbook. 12"". that's right. small as they come. i like small things. always have. 

3. juan leaves tomorrow. i'm a lot more sad about that fact than i would have believed i would be several months ago. but i'm really going to miss him. :( but he'll be in a better place, as they say. one full of college parties, 14 hour adderall-induced study sessions, public transportation, and metro fashion trends. guess there's not much else to say but good luck, and i'll see you when you're in town dude.

"event","i'm in killeen. josh's mom and her house and everything is all really nice. it's quite a locale/residential upgrade from devine. don't get me wrong, i'm gonna miss devine, a lot. it's a cool little town, i've got some good memories of it. i can tell josh misses it a lot regardless of how he likes things here so far. that's his home after all. he's got a lot more good memories than any of us do. nonetheless i think he'll fit in really well here. it's laid back, there's a lot of car enthusiasts (his mom and he boyfriend are in a mustang club), his mom lets him do whatever, he'll be making good money, etc. i wouldn't mind the life he's got. but mostly i'm just gonna miss him. him living an hour away to begin with is gonna help, but it's still going to be an adjustment knowing he's like 3 hours away now. i'm planning on trying to go up at least like once a month and take as many people who can/want to come along for the visit.

it's been raining like crazy all weekend. there is so much lightning at night that you can see everything as if it were daylight. thunder shakes the windows and sets off car alarms. it's great to sit outside and smoke a joint when it's like this.

school starts wednesday. i'm actually happy. i'll finally have something to do. i just hope i can stick with it long enough to get somewhere. i have the worst work ethic of anyone i've ever known. i'm the biggest procrastinator and i never stick to most things. i need to learn to finish what i start. i can't even remember how it feels to be proud of myself for accomplishing something even slightly important. nothing i've done for almost a year now has given me any meaning. but luckily my optimism is beginning to become more permanent. even if i have a terrible day i'm usually alright. thanks modern prescription drugs! 

i'm thinking about trying to transfer to UT austin for the spring. i want to do film or photojournalism or something like that. something that involves writing. but NOT english. bleeeech! UTSA doesn't really offer either, and plus austin is just a cool fucking city. live music everywhere."

"event","so being breezy is the theme of my fucking life right now. in case you don't know, being ""breezy"" is just acting like u don't care about something. now let me tell ya, in a relationship it's a great way to protect urself, but if u have serious feelings for someone, then being breezy can really fuck with ur head. i just wish that i didn't feel like i needed to be breezy to the one person that i wish the most i could be open to. but i guess that would just make my life too easy. i keep telling myself that everything takes time...but when i think about all the time we've spent(and trust me...it's a lot, maybe even too much) i can't help but feel like we should be moving toward something. but i feel like we're in a rut...just...stuck. 

i don't think we want the same things....but what can i do"

<P>The topography is made up of peaks and valleys, this is what I think best decribes our patterns for civilization. Our history plays out in a series of uphill battles and level platos. We're never done fighting a battle, but have have brief moments of ease in between the major ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp; One of the biggest battles we fought, and are still fighting today is racism. Racism is not just an issue in the United States, countries all around the world battle with racial issues. A lot of terrorism is based on racial beliefs. Luckily for us, race doesn't play a big part in our daily lives. Unfortunatley, it's not like that everywhere, and people are still being victimized by the color of their skin. But for now most of us can rest easy on the side of the law.</P>
<P>&nbsp; Sexuality is another huge battle. But this one is a little bit&nbsp;more conterversle. Right now for instants,&nbsp;we are battling with the issue of same sex marriages. Now, a lot of people are arguing with the point of faith, saying it's wrong to be gay because it's a sin. Well here's a news flash, everybody sins!! Who are we to say one sin is more accountable than another. A sin is a sin. There is no scale that I know of that rates sins from greatest to least. So I don't think that one person's sin should be held against them stronger than another person. Especially when it has nothing to do with anyone except that person. We can't help but love the people we love, no matter their gender.</P>
<P>&nbsp; History will show that education has come a long way, and it has. For example,&nbsp;Women now have choices of what they want to do with their lives. And the number&nbsp;in fields of careears&nbsp;to choose from has multiplied in past forty years or so. But one thing still remains, education is an essential to get anywhere you want to be. Back when racism was still a major issue, the majority of black kids didn't go to school. They had to stay home and work because their family's lived in poverty and needed the money. But now that we don't discriminate who we educate, poverty is a lot less of an issue. With education you can get a job, and if your working you are getting an annual&nbsp; salary wich means you don't have to live in poverty.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Our history has had it's ups and downs,&nbsp;and I think&nbsp;that it always will.&nbsp;Like they say, ""You can please some people somtimes, but you can't please all people all the time"".&nbsp; </P></B></STRONG>"

It fucking rocks more than life itself!! Anyway, another reason why I feel like I jus smoked an ounce to my head is because my brand new cell phone (the one that I went swimming with 3 days after i got it) decided to work today!! So basically I jus saved myself about $179 bucks. Woop Woop! Anyhooters, I'm out for the night bitches. Luv Ya Like A Fat Kid Luv's Cake :-)

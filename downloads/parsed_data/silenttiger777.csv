"event","huh, never thought I'd ever be writing those words in that order.  One of my few friends from church, Michael Martin, was killed this morning responding to a heart attack victim about 5:50am.  I didn't know him terribly well, but he was someone who was genuine.  I sorta got to know him this Winter when we went to PraiseFest.  I roomed with him, and three other guys, and we all became good friends.  Michael, I guess, was the quiet one of that group.  He never said much, but he never really needed too.  It's a true shame that we lost him this morning...but he loved the Lord and he's in Heaven now, seeing things and experiencing things I've only dreamed about.  So, you see, I am sad that he's gone, but I'm not hurt over it...he's in a better place.  To anyone who reads this, say a prayer for his family...they are pretty shaken right now."

"event","Well, I finally figured out how LiveJournal works...thanks Ash!  It's a little different from Xanga, but I think I'm gonna like it better.

So, what to talk about?  Hmm, well, nothing has happened to me today.  Parents are still a royal pain, but I don't really expect that to change until I move out.  They just don't seem to understand things...and it doesn't matter how I break it down to them, they won't ever understand.  They claim they're only trying to help, which I'm sure they think that they are, but sometimes, silence is the best help of all.  

Ah, growing up is a bitch.  It's no fun at all.  I remember days where the toughest decision I had to make was whether to eat the purple or orange popsicle.  Ha, days long gone past.  What really sucks, is that in 10 years or so, I'm gonna be saying, ""I remember the days where I was still in school...things were simple then.""  Hmm, maybe not.  I was always told that I should enjoy my highschool years because they were going to be the best years of my life...bunch of bullshit that was.  Don't miss those days at all.  The sad thing is, the situation hasn't really improved any.

I've been so angry lately, and I don't know why.  It's like, well, I don't really know what it's like.  I've never been one to get angry at anything, and now, the least little thing sets me off.  I know I'm still getting over the two week rush that I experienced the last two weeks of school, but you'd think I'd be over that by now....  

The bad thing is, I don't really have an escape anymore.  I used to be able to cut on a videogame and get lost in a fantasy world that didn't harbor any of the ""real life"" drama.  I could go exploring, collect treasures, save people, etc.  Yeah, it's all fake, I've always known that, but now, the fakeness is so real, it just makes me long for a change even more.

Well, thinking about it, I do have an escape, I just don't get to use it everyday.  I went fishing with Jordan and Jenny Monday.  Yeah, it really sucked, I didn't catch anything, and I felt REAL bad for using life worms for bait (torturing animals/bugs for my pleasure/gain has never been real high on my ""Favorite things to do"" list), but it was good to hang out with my best friend and his girl.  It really sucks that we didn't end up going to the same college.

I spent most of Tuesday with Ashley, which is always a blast.  We watched AI (A kinda odd movie), and Pulp Fiction.  I tell you what, Tarintino films are ROUGH in the language that is used...to the point where it is despicable, but if you disregard that, his films are freaking awesome.  I mean, yeah, I can understand a few curse words here and there (we all use them, whether we admit it or not), but when you're having to rearrange sentences to the point where they really don't make any sense, you're using them too much.  But his movies have an attitude that most movies don't have.  I find that I really enjoy them (minus the language, of course).

Hanging out with Ashley is so different too.  I'm not real sure what to compare it too (and I gotta be careful, she might be reading this!), but it's really fun.  As always, I very often make a complete fool out of myself; mixing my words, tripping up, hurting myself, bumbling around, but I think she's learned to put up with that (which is lucky).  

Well, looking at the time, I'm sure everyone will be home soon, so I'm gonna wrap it up.  And this concludes my first post!"

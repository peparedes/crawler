"event","For those of you that haven't noticed, my LiveJournal is done forever.  Yeah, this is for all the thick people out there that didn't really pick up on this subtle fact yet.  The closing of my journal is due to a few things.  Number one, I never really go on the internet ever anymore, unless I have something utterly important to do for school.  Which is pretty much never haha.  Number two, I do not really like going on the internet anymore.  I got more important shits to be doing.  Like your mom.  Number three, I do not really have time for the internet anymore.  Baseball, drama issues, personal issues, you know.  Number four, I do not like any of my recent entries.  At all.  I kind of lost my ADHD, and they just weren't good like they was back in the days.  Those were the golden days indeed.  I kind of regained this ADHD the other day.  I was struggling to get a grip on life, but thankfully I did.  It kind of took a week or two for me to pull my head out of my ass and realize how wonderful life is.  And how set I really am at this point <3.  Number five, I do not think that other people think my entries are funny anymore.  I can't even say I'm doing it for the kids, because I do not think the kids enjoy it very much.  Whatever.  Number six... nope, those are all the sucky excuses I got.  Nexxxxxxttt!
In conclusion, this is farewell.  I'm really going now.  It's been really neat.  I swurr.  Just always remember back in the days where it was at yo (that would be right hurr).  Going onto the computer and checking out what I had to say.  Just about everyday.  Ahhhh good times, good times.  So uhhhhhhhh... enjoy life without me.  You poor, poor suckassssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!  Heh heh, later everyone!

""Don't be sad that it's over.  Be happy that it happened.""


P.S. This quote isn't really for my journal at all.  It is better suited for something that begins with g and ends in raduation.  Or whatever else comes to an end in your life.  Because every beginning comes from something else's end.  And happy endings wouldn't be possible without beginnings.  So live life at the way you see fit.  The way that will make you happy.  It isn't about success or money at all.  If that's what makes you happy, then go for it.  But it isn't for everyone.  Just live so you're happy with yourself.  And go to sleep each night happy and content.  Because you may not be here tomorrow.  So make each day a good one. And that is how to live life well.  Have a nice life.  I know I will. :-) :-) :-)"

I'm guessing this is from a recent event that transpired, though I haven't done anything different recently that I've always been doing all along here.  Whatever.  I think this is supposed to be a punishment.  But it totally isn't.  I don't know if you fellas noticed, but I'm not on the computer that much anymore.  But don't tell my parents that.  Haha.  Yeah, this is going to be my last entry for a while.  I'm sorry.  Read the old entries from long ago, because they were awesome.  These new ones suck.  I apologize.  Well, my mom's home now.

"event","Haha guess what?  I'm still the President of Seymour High School.  Now that is weird.  I've actually done a lot in the past week.  See, our class is kind of down $1,000.  So I've been trying to get that money back pretty much.  Trying to get people to pay their dues.  Remind people about the Senior Picnic.  Hypnotist show and shit.  Yeah, I've done more this past week than I did the whole rest of the year I think.  Being in a real position of power would be real neat.  I think I would be good at it.  But then again, the whole rest of the world probably thinks they would be good at it.  Whatever.  If I want it, one day I'll have it.  I don't want to say anything else right now, and I want to shut down the computer.  Today I have off from baseball.  Kelo's words:  ""I don't even want to fuckin see you guys tomorrow!!!!""  Yeah, I'm pretty sure they heard him in the next four towns over.  That was the loudest I've ever heard him yell.  Ever.  Now that's saying something.  Yeah, so he wasn't in school, and there's no baseball today.  So that means I can do everything in my workout.  Which isn't happening, because I have other shit to do.  So I'm thinking I may just do a sit-up circuit and 3 sets of 15 on bench.  Yeah, it'll be a suprise.  Yayyyyyy.  pEACE."

"event","We lost today.  Yeah, it wasn't good.  It's too bad that baseball isn't the most important thing in the world to me anymore.  Because if it was, I would be mucho depressed all night.  But I wasn't.  Can't remember why....  You realize that baseball is just a game, and life goes on.  But if it could go on without Ashleigh, that I don't think would be possible.  Sure, you get into the game once it starts, and you want nothing more than for your team to win, but once you lose, you realize that it's not the end of the world.  I'll talk about our lack of leadership another day.  Because this lacking isn't really there.  And shit.  Yeah, I have to go now.  Sorry.  Someone took up a lot of my time tonight.  And John, if you do that again, I will beat you."

"event","Yeah, we beat Watertown today 3-1.  This is our first winning streak of over 1 this season.  Woooooooooooo!  I didn't play today.  When you stink, you don't get to play.  Darn.  Tomorrow we're playing Woodland.  We'll see how that goes.  They're like 10-2 or some shit.  I don't really want to talk about anything else.  Let's just think of a good story.  Hopefully something recent.  Hmmmmmmmmm.  Okay this is a bad story, but I just thought of it for some reason.  The other day I was driving Jordan Kershaw home, when I come to a four-way intersection and stop and the whatnot because the light was red.  So this lady coming from my right takes a left, which means she has to drive past me.  And she rolls down her window and starts yelling at me because I was like four inches over the stop line.  But do you know what?  Probably not, so I'll tell you.  Every time she tried to get words out, Jordan would interrupt her and say, ""Okay, we're sorry.""  And she kept trying.  And he kept cutting her off.  So eventually the light turned green, and we drove off.  The end.  Oh, I do have a good story.  The other day I was sitting at home looking out the window.  Typical Saturday night, ya know.  All of the sudden I see this giant fireball come down out of the sky and land near Route 8.  Several seconds later, the Bat Signal was in the sky.  And I was off.  To the Batcave (or driveway)!  I totally got in the Benny Blake Mobile a.k.a. the Batmobile, and then I went to check out the situation.  Well, I just remembered that I'm totally supposed to be at Gordo's house in ten minutes, so I'll have to finish this story sometime later.  And yes, I do have ADHD.  It's a killer!  Hasta la bye bye!"

"event","Ha.  I'm an asshole.  Ohhhhhhhh well!  Might as well start with the good news.  We beat Sacred Heart today 8-2.  Yeah, we have to win tomorrow.  Then we'll be back at .500 with momentum to steal a game away from Woodland on Thursday.  We'll see how that goes.  I have a bunch of other shit to say, but I don't really feel like being boring today.  Let's cut to the chase.  I had my four hour AP Calc test today, as did the rest of the country.  I told those College Board fuckers.  I told them good.  Ha, who would put free response questions on their test for a bunch of immature teenagers to answer?  Think College Board, think!  Yeah, I don't know anything about Calculus.  And I was running out of time.  And I still had a whole free response question to go.  This question had four parts... A, B, C, and D.  So A I answered just fine, probably got it wrong, blah blah blah.  Then I saw I had thirty seconds left.  So I'm like, ""Darrrrrrrnnn!"" (in John's accent)  So on part B I wrote the following:  I love men.  On part C I wrote:  College Board loves men.  On part D I wrote:  We all love men.  Thennnn on like number four or some shit, I had an idea of what to do.  I had to use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.  However, I couldn't really remember how to go about this.  Because I'm retarded and stuff.  So I wrote out this big long explanation of the Fundamental Theorem that Gordo told me.  It had to do with losing fat and gaining muscle.  And stairs.  And elevators.  Yeahhhh.  So I wrote this big long explanation, drew some pictures, and then wrote ""Boo Yeah!"" in big letters at the bottom.  Then there was this whole question on slope fields.  I have no idea what slope fields are.  So the first two parts of that one I totally made up.  Then on the last part, I decided I was shot already.  So I would have to totally do something stupid again.  At least whoever corrects mine will get a good laugh.  I told them how a couple years ago I figured out how to multiply two digit numbers in my head.  And I showed my teacher and stuff, and they were impressed.  Then I proclaimed myself God, and gave up on math.  And that was the end of my exam.  Best.  Test.  Ever.  Well, John's here now, and since I can't multitask, I'm done.  Laterrrrrrrrr."

Brain hemmorhages, strike outs, 1's on AP Calculus tests.  It's not good.  I have start finding a way to get things done.  Or I will be a failure in life.  No success stories go the path that I'm currently on.  I need to grow some balls and stop giving gutless performances like a little puss.  Because I can't depend on people to get me through.  I can't think that someone else will always get it done for me.  It's not in my nature.  As many people know by now.  So I'm going to stop pretending that I'm okay when I'm totally not.  And then suck it up and stay alive.  And that's all I have to say about that.  Goodbye."

"event","Yesterday I did a whole hell of a lot of nothinggg.  And by the extended nothing, I definitely mean something that I'm not telling.  Yeah.  It was basically the best day of my life.  Again.  I can't wait until the real best day of my life comes.  That's gonna be a doozy.  I pretty much have ditched everything in my life for just one thing.

I slept a lot yesterday.  Let's review the week, and see why I needed the rest very badly.  These are the times I went to bed.  I chose to stay up this late for no reasons at all.

He might call you on the radio and say he's not Dracula, but you just say, 'Think again, bat man.'""

Time for Quiz numero dos!  Yayyyyyyyy!  I googled ""neat quizzes"" today, and I might have found the most pointless game put on the internet.  Ever.

3. IF GOD ACTUALLY SHOWED UP WHILE YOU WERE SAYING ""OH, GOD"" IN BED, WHAT EXACTLY WOULD YOU DO?  The only time I'm in bed is when I'm asleep.  So first I would wake up.  And then my arousal level would rise, and I would pick up the shotgun on the side of my bed.  Then I would fire some shots at God.  And then I would go to hell for trying to kill God.  But I'm already going there, so it doesn't really matter.  The end.
4. QUIET. NO ONE'S LOOKING. ACROSS FROM YOU IS YOUR FRIEND THE WANNABE HIPPY, WICCAN, SAVE THE DOLPHINS FROM THE WHALES, BAN BRAS, MOTHER EARTH, CALL ON THE GODDESS SORT OF PERSON.

21. DID IT TURN YOU ON OR JUST MAKE YOU CLINICALLY INSANE?  You give me a headache.

I was walking down the street the other day because ya know, my car was taken away for my excellent report card.  And there was this punk-ass fool on this punk-ass bike.  And I'm all, ""Yo, that's a punk-ass bike.""  And he's all, ""Yo, you're a punk-ass kid.""  And I'm all, ""Yo, you wanna fight with cinnamon sticks?""  And he's all, ""Woooorrrd.""  So then we went to Cuba, and got some cinnamon sticks.  But then we decided we were hungry, so we ate them.  Then he tried to sucker punch me in the face, but I grabbed his fist.  Then with my other hand, I grabbed the back of his head while simultaneously bringing my knee upwards.  Then I bashed his face into my accelerating knee.  Then his head fell off because his neck wasn't properly supported when he was a baby.  Then I said, ""Punk-ass bitch"", and continued on my way to Tommy K's.
7. BIRD OR FISH?  Bird. 
8. THE ABOVE-AS A PET OR AS DINNER?  Fish suck.  Though when I was a young lad, I got this goldfish when I was 2.  He didn't die until I was in 5th grade.  Yeah, he was nine years old.  Best.  Goldfish.  Ever.
9. WHAT YOU'RE BEST AT  Nothing if ruling the world doesn't count.
10. WHAT YOU SUCK AT  If by ""at"", you mean ""on"", then I suck on... uhhh wait, nevermind.............
11. WHAT YOU REALLY FUCKING SUCK AT  Taking quizzi.

"event","Yeah, going to baseball on less than three hours sleep is not a good plan.  It's a good thing the game was canceled.  Because I was going to start at DH today.  Phew.  Haha.  Yeah, so I just had practice instead.  Tomorrow is the hit-a-thon.  Which means our next off-day will be next Sunday.  That's like 13 days of baseball in a row.  That's some intense shit.  I don't think I really like it.  V. tiring and stuff.  V stands for very, by the way.  Next week we have four games in four days.  It's periods like these that define seasons.  They either make you or break you, depending on how you do.  If we can come out of it 2-2, I would consider it a success.  We play Torrington at French on Monday, Sacred Heart at God knows where in Waterbury on Tuesday, Watertown in Watertown on Wednesday, and Woodland at French on Thursday.  Woooooo!  I'm just going to try and focus on doing the best that I can to help the team, and then hopefully everything else will work itself out in the end.  Because you can't focus on all the other things.  All the tradition behind Seymour baseball.  And how we're a disgrace and going to ruin it.  And how no one gave us a chance at the beginning of the year.  All you're stats and junk.  Because when you're in it, the only stat that matters is the Win and Loss column.  And right now, ours isn't really that swell at 4-5.  When all is said and done, then you can look back on everything surrounding the season.  It's kind of neat to think about all the players that came before me and wore the uniform of the Wildcats.  Jay Perez, Dwight Wildman, Dave Tokarz, Brian Moir, Dan Ruggerio, Ed Kurdy; all those guys.  The season should work out just fine.  Kelo's teams always find a way.  Time for a neat story!  One year, Coach Moir's sophomore year, the team had one senior.  They started out 3-8.  And back then, you needed 10 wins to get into the tournament.  As opposed to the 8 you need now.  Well anyways, in their next 9 games they went 7-2.  And finished out the season 10-10.  They then went to the semifinals of the state tournament, and lost to Notre Dame, who was the eventual champion.  And they were leading Notre Dame for most of the game too.  So there's always hope.  Stupid everyone.  We'll show them all.  Yeah, we'll see how next week goes.  I'll keep my fingers crossed.  I think that's all for today.  Farewell my friends."

"event","We beat Wilby today 4-3.  Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!  A lot of people came to watch me play today.  I liked it.  I started at DH and batted sixth.  Phew, glad I could actually get a start when people came to see me play.  Yesssssssssss.  I got a hit/error in the fourth inning that scored Jordan Kershaw.  I ran into the first basemen because he was totally in the way, and then I almost died.  It was a close one.  If it went down as a hit, that's an RBI.  Yeahhhhh bitchessssssssssss.  Basically if Ashleigh doesn't come, I suck.  I'm pretty sure that every game she's been to that I played in, I got a hit.  And shit.  Now I'm going bowling and shit with my brother and Kirstin.  And stuff.  Tomorrow we're playing Sacred Heart.  Those punks are going down.  Yeah.  Well, it's time to go now.  So in conclusion, I love life, Ashleigh, baseball, this song that's playing, and everything else in the world.  Goodbye my loves!!!!!!!"

 Last night I made a chatroom.  It was really neat.  Brought me back to the old days.  I suck at making chatrooms though, because I only invite people into them once someone has left and I feel the need to replace them and junk.  Yeah, I'm not good.  Anyways, I made the chatroom for John, and he totally didn't even say one word in it.  Ungrateful jek.  He's running for President and junk.  He's like my protege or something.  Yeahhhhhh, I might have more to discuss on this matter later.  Right now I really don't feel like it.  Last night I took a yogurt cup and put it in the freezer.  Then I froze it.  Then I ate it.  And it was good.  I decided to call it frozen yogurt.  I think I shall patent this idea one day.  I would appreciate it if you would all be honest and good people and not steal my wonderful idea that I just shared with you.  Thank you for your cooperation.  My dad got me a job this summer.  He doesn't really know what I'll be doing, but I'm making over $9 an hour.  It has to do with microfilming or some shit.  I don't really know what that is.  But he says that I'll probably be getting paid a shitload of money to do nothing.  I didn't argue.  Well, I kind of feel like being lazy.  Suprise!  So yeah, I'm gonna split.  Buenos Nachos!!!!"

"event","Enter depressing entry.  It's been a while since I've done one of these.  I don't really have anything else to say, so I'll let it fly.
Ya know what's cute?  When you try to tell yourself that your life has some direction, but you totally know it doesn't.  And everyone else ever knows it too.  Yeah, I think it's pretty cute how the whole world thinks I'm either going to drop out of college or fail out.  It's not illogical to think so.  My prioritizing sucks, and I kind of always look to do the minimul work possible.  Basically because I never found any of this whole school work thing to be all that important.  Because it really isn't.  But the question arises that if this isn't all that important now, when will it start to become important?  Another thing that's cute is how my life never really has a definite purpose because I can never really decide on a path ever.  I have no idea what I want to be.  Or if I want to be anything.  Last year I felt my high school career was going in a similar direction.  So I decided to do something about it.  I guess I did a pretty good job.  Yeah, it's gonna be hard for me to find something to do with the rest of my life.  Because I don't like anything.  Or if I do actually like something, I don't like it for very long.  I can honestly say that Ashleigh is the only constant I'm planning on.  Probably ever.  I know this.  Ashleigh knows this.  And I don't see it all turning around anytime soon.  It's just who I am.  And if you don't like it, tough.  I'm not changing for anyone.  That's the day I bend over and take it in the ass.  Yeah, that was inappropriate.  I apologize.  Stupid, stupid Ben Blake.
Yep, so that's how it goes.  There is one thing that I do know that I would like to share with all you.  First of all, I never ever ever do anything the conventional and traditional way.  Everyone should know that by now after reading that life story ha.  A lot more people actually read the whole thing than I expected.  It was about 17 pages double-spaced on Microsoft Word haha.  Anyhoo, where was I?  Oh yeah.  If I do actually find something to do with this whole life of mine, there is no doubt that if I want to be on top, I can achieve it.  Pretty much everyone in the whole world will doubt me.  As always.  But I deserve it.  It's the image I create for myself.  I kind of do it on purpose, because I like to catch people off-guard and junk.  But then again, I don't really think about it before-hand, it's just who I am.  But if I believe in myself, I'm pretty sure I can accomplish anything I want.  I'll find a way to get it done.  And that's all you have to do to achieve any of your goals really.  Always believe in yourself and find a way to get it done.  Since I've only really achieved one important thing in my life ever, I'll just use that as an example.  My Presidential victory, duh!  It is one thing that not many people could do.  Actually, no one was going to.  Brian Dunlop decided to run once he knew I was.  Jek.  No one really truly believed that I would win.  I even remember Sean Burke's exact words in February or January when I was telling him some ideas I had:  ""Give it up Benny, you're not going to win.""  That was pretty much everyone's thoughts I bet.  And if they weren't, they should have been haha.  Because I totally didn't deserve that win.  Sure, people got excited for me and junk.  But did they honestly think I could beat Adam Rozum?  I think not.  Hell, even I voted for Adam Rozum.  Boy, that was dumb haha.  I'll get into that at some other time.  Let's see, where was I?  Oh yes.  Even my parents and my best friend didn't have any faith in me.  Jeks.  But you see.  You don't need 'em if you really want it.  All you need is yourself.  This is the perfect example.  Many people say the campaign posters is what won me the election.  I used to say the same thing.  That is entirely false.  You want to know how I won?  I believed in myself from the beginning.  I had all the confidence in the world, no matter what anyone said.  And I really really really wanted it.  So I found a way to get it done.  This can apply to any goal anyone has.  If you truly believe in yourself, and you really really want it, you will find a way to get it done.  Things will fall into place.  And you'll be able to achieve anything you want.  So what's the moral of this entry?  My life may have no direction, but I have not lost any confidence in myself in no way, shape, or form.  I'm glad everyone has no confidence in my future.  Because I can't wait to prove everyone wrong.  Again.  Because I know no matter where I go, what I do, if I really want it, I'll be on top.  Just like I am now.  Guess this entry wasn't so depressing after all.  Darn.

"event","Hmmmmmmmm, what the hell could I say as a follow-up entry to yesterday?  6,601 words... yeahyuh!  I was thinking about this game on the internet that I always used to play on the computer earlier today.  I used to play it last summer and shit.  When I was still cool of course.  It was on that Candy Stand website thing for Lifesavers or whatever.  Not important.  That site is loaded with worms.  I liked it not.  But I always played the damn game anyways.  It was a game where you try and pitch a perfect game.  It would be very boring to any other person.  But I liked it a lot.  Don't remember what the hell the exact name of it was.  But I do remember that one way or another, I would always give up a hit.  No matter what.  I would always eventually give up a hit, no matter how perfect the pitch.  You pitch it to where the hitters couldn't possibly hit it, and they would get a hit off of it anyways.  Yeah, I then concluded that it was impossible to complete the fucking game and pitch a perfect game.  And then that got me thinking.  Maybe you're not supposed to ever pitch the perfect game.  Maybe the game is actually trying to teach everyone a lesson.  You ever hear life is a ball game?  Well, it's true.  No life is supposed to be perfect.  You're going to have rocky points in your life, and people are going to get hits off of you.  But the best pitchers, and the people that are the best at this game of life, learn to work around these rocky points and not give up any runs.  Thus preventing the ultimate failure.  A loss.  Yeah, that's all I have to say tonight.  I know, I know.  I'm not good.  Whenever I say something to my mom like, ""Yeah my mom, I don't know what's wrong with me."", she always responds with, ""Son, you're in love.""  That seems to be her excuse for me for everything now.  It's too bad I'm not kidding either.  Haha.  But what she says is pretty much right.  I wonder if she knows that.  Haha, farewell my friends."

"event","What I'm about to say, it isn't going to be good.  But it'll be better to say it sooner rather than later.  Many people are going to get mad at me for saying this, but this is how it went.  And how it goes.  From top to bottom, from beginning to end.  If I offend anyone in this entry, tough.  Because I'm going to offend pretty much everyone.  It's going to probably be the most personal thing I ever write ever, with all my feelings and junk.  I think I'm going to drop names like it's nothing.  And there's no way to stop it.  Because it's only the truth.  And if you can't handle it, stop reading now.
I guess I should start this all the way back.  It had to be the beginning of May or the end of April in 2004.  I wasn't President yet, but everyone knew I was running.  I was sitting online one day, minding my own business, when Dan Shpak invited me into a chatroom.  It was here that I first met Ashleigh.  We all talked and the whatnot.  Eventually, this would evolve into a chatroom every night.  The locals tended to be me, Dan, Ashleigh, Kat, Tim, Jess, and Richelle.  I didn't really talk to any of them outside the chatrooms that much, just Dan.  Not getting personally involved or whatever.  I had my own matters to attend to.  Like prom.  I think at one time I had like 8 prom dates.  So you know what I did?  I didn't want anyone to hate me, so I just didn't go.  I wanted to go with Kathy Stachura, and Dan even talked to her for me.  As we both tried to make it work, I decided to call off the whole thing because now I was supposed to be going with all these people.  And I didn't want anyone to get burned, so I just decided not to go altogether.  Yeah, you want to know why Ben Blake didn't go to his prom?  Because he didn't want to hurt anyone's fucking feelings.  Way to fuckin go asshole.  Anyhoooo, eventually I became President, and that made my life feel pretty complete.  It's a shame I didn't die right then and there.  That would have made things a whole hell of a lot easier.  So ya know, the underdog's on top and whatnot.  Eventually, Dan forms this little crew for the seven of us in the chatrooms.  I was never into this whole crew business.  I didn't want to get personally attached and whatnot.  I never did, to avoid getting burned later.  My father always said, ""If you care about other people too much, you're eventually gonna get burned.""  And I always listened to him.  Up until... well, I'll get to that.  This was one of the things I made sure I always tried to accomplish.  The other is making sure everyone else around me was happy.  Everyone but me.  I never really cared about my own happiness.  I just wanted everyone else ever to be happy.  That was my main goal in life pretty much.  Not a care or thought to myself ever really.  And I would do anything to make sure this happened.  This would also play a part later on.  So the seven of us are in this little crew business.  Ashleigh kind of cheats on Dan with Matt Harner, and I'm pretty sure this only brought those two closer.  Lies get told about what Ashleigh confesses as Jess spills the beans to everyone.  If this is true or not, I do not know.  It doesn't matter now, that was just a silly situation at a silly time.  Everyone graduates junior year, Jess graduates high school, blah blah.  We start to have these crew hangout kind of dealy things in which we all hang out together.  I remember the first one pretty much.  Me, Tim, Dan, and Jess went minigolfing.  And Jess cheated.  And Dan made up his own rules.  So I guess we all cheated.  Yessssssss.  Eventually, because of proximity and the whatnot, Richelle is like, kicked out the crew or something.  Because she was never there at the hangouts and junk.  On July 10th, Dan officially asked Ashleigh out.  It was a good day for the time.  Not a good day for the time now, obviously.  But a time no one can forget.  Nor should it ever be forgotten.  So now the crew of 6 does a lot of shit together, and has a wonderful summer.  Baseball games, nighttime hangouts, online chatrooms.  A fairly decent combination.  Everyone liked it a lot.  And I'm still doing my best to not get personally attached to anyone.  As August came to a close, the shit started.  And by shit I mean school.  And here's where things go downhill.  Jess goes off to college.  This limits her crew capabilities.  But everyone tries their best to include her in.  Or so I hope.  Around this time, everyone decided that Jess was trying to steal Dan away from Ashleigh.  Yeah, those two always hated each other.  In case you couldn't tell haha.  They've both said silly things about each other that they don't regret.  But I'm not going to share them here, because they are not appropriate.  If you're wondering what I know about what you said, I know all.  We'll leave it at that.  So yeah, Ashleigh hates my cousin.  Hmmm.  Haha.  Anyways, things between Dan and Ashleigh begin to get rocky.  And I always take Dan's side.  Number one, she hates my cousin.  Number two, everyone else was on his side, and every story that I ever heard ever always made it look like she's the bad person.  Always.  I never got her side of it.  Ever.  Still not getting personally attached.  So everyone gangs up on Ashleigh all the time.  Not swell.  I remember during the summer or there abouts, I called Ashleigh up on the phone because she wasn't answering Dan's calls.  Dan got so mad, I vowed to never do it again.  So I remember one day Ashleigh got mad at me because I refused to call her up.  And I never did again for the rest of the year.  Because I wanted the people around to be happy always, and if I called Ashleigh, Dan would not be a happy man.  Ohhhhh the irony of it all.  During crew hangouts, Jess is busy with college and the whatnot, so it was basically a crew of five.  Online chatrooms begin to go away.  It was pretty much only me, Dan, and Kat online.  Tim had homework all the time.  Hard-worker.  I give him credit for that now still.  Not much credit for anything else.  Sorry.  Continuing on, I don't know where Ashleigh was.  Cheerleading and work and stuff.  I don't blame her for not coming online.  I wouldn't have either if I was in her situation.  Why go somewhere that makes you miserable?  That's just insanity.  Tim always said the day Ashleigh and Dan broke up, so would the crew.  Me and Kat reassured Dan this would never happen, because we would all still be friends.  We would just be without Ashleigh and junk.  It's too bad we couldn't see the future, because then we would have never said that bullshit.  So yeah, Dan and Ashleigh have problems, and everyone's on Dan's side.  Our crew is having trouble staying together, and eventually it'll be down to me and Dan trying to keep things the way they were in the summer.  Yeah, this falling apart happened during like October and November.  I know, I'm skipping around a lot.  And I'm going to continue to.  I'm not good.  As for myself and my feelings.  Oh bother.  Ever hear it's lonely at the top?  Well it's true here.  Except I don't think the loneliness was from being at the top.  I don't know what it was from.  At the end of last summer, I'm pretty sure Sarah Rapuano liked me and shit.  Don't hold me to that.  But I, like the good person I am, tried my best to avoid her.  And in the process, I'm pretty sure I ruined a good friendship that I had during my junior year.  Yessss, way to go you asshole.  It wouldn't be the first time I avoided a chick.  Another recent one was sophomore year when Caitlin Cann asked me out.  Avoided her too.  Another friendship ruined.  Yesssss, I just knock them all down, don't I?  I don't want to get into the others.  It's not a fun subject.  Alright, where was I?  Ohhh yeah, this feeling of loneliness.  Yeah, I don't know where it came from.  But all the time I felt like it was me against the world.  Like there was no one with me.  I had to do it all on my own.  Or fail.  Maybe because I wasn't personally close with any of my friends.  I ruined my close friendship with Andrew Evancho just before the summer began.  And, in effect, with other people.  I stopped caring about school a lot, and started focusing on my social life a lot.  Bad decision.  In September, I started talking to this girl from Glastonbury named Alex.  I knew nothing could ever work between us, but I liked talking to her anyways.  She made me smile and laugh.  She still does.  So I kept talking to her.  And I think a lot of people got the wrong impression from this talking.  But I kind of liked the attention that it got.  So I just went with it.  Well I started talking to her on the phone, and then I broke the rule.  I got personally attached.  I wanted to talk to her.  A lot.  And when I didn't, I was sad.  Around the beginning of November, I developed this psychological problem.  All the sudden for about a minute or so, I would want to kill something.  Like just run through a wall.  For no reason.  I can't explain it.  Then I would calm down, and I would be back to normal.  Yeah, skipping around a lot still.  Good luck keeping track of all this haha.  We'll just go to November now.  My grades are really slipping now, my parents are getting on me, and the crew is failing.  Not........................ cool.  I think everyone is still against Ashleigh in the problems of her and Dan.  Well eventually I think she opens up to Kat.  I don't know when this was.  It's not important.  She just held all this shit back from everyone for a long while.  And then everyone was against her without even knowing what she was feeling.  They just thought she was some crazy psycho bitch based on the stories told.  Haha, or something along those lines.  Sorry, I got carried away.  Anyways, November was a very very bad month.  I was sad a lot.  Somewhere in here, Alex thought I was mad at her.  I thought she was mad at me.  We didn't talk.  This didn't help things.  I wanted to run away from it all for a while.  Actually for the whole month.  One day I almost did.  John talked me out of it.  Asshole.  Things would have been a lot different if I did it then.  Yeah.  Beginning of December.  Those days were good.  The crew felt right again.  I made peace with Alex and we was talking again.  But by December 8th.... damn that middle of December.  I always had these inclings that Kat liked me.  And I didn't want to get personally attached to anyone ever.  Mainly because I'm an asshole.  So yeah, these inclings were proved right.  How is not important.  So I decided it was time to go into Ben Blake Defense Mode.  Again.  Asshole.  This is where everything begins to come undone.  Yay!  Oh yeah, my LiveJournal.  I created a LiveJournal in the beginning of September because I pretty much worshipped Sean Burke's.  I started writing in it around the end of October.  I left pointless entries, but kids thought they were witty and funny, so I kept doing it.  Every day.  So anyways, back to Ben Blake Defense Mode.  I was supposed to rake all the leaves in the yard in November.  But me, being the hard-worker I am, didn't do it yet as I was sitting in the middle of December.  It was supposed to be a brotherly effort, but I was always blamed for it not getting done.  Suprise!  So December 11th comes.  And so do progress reports.  Ms. Divito felt the need to be an asshole and give me an F that I did not have.  I got two D's or something too.  It's not important.  Point is, I didn't rake the leaves, my grades were failing, and my parents wanted to punish me real bad.  And I saw the perfect opportunity to put Ben Blake Defense Mode in place.  Woohoo!  I guess.  So yeah, they cut off my communication from the world at this point.  I didn't even argue.  I wrote a farewell journal entry.  Ever wonder why it didn't sound sad?  There's your reason.  Still not getting personally attached.  Little did I know this was probably the worst thing I could do to myself.  The loneliness was getting to me.  If I knew this, I probably would have made the same decision.  Mainly because I'm a stubborn asshole.  So Ashleigh and Kat now hate me.  Or think I hate them.  Or both.  Not important, I deserved it.  I made it seem like I didn't care at all.  Which isn't true.  I cared too much, and didn't want her to get hurt.  So I stayed away in any way possible.  Bad decision.  Little did I know she was probably just what I needed.  I don't remember much from those days of noncommunication.  I was a very lonely little boy holding everything back from everyone.  Holding everything inside me.  And eventually before Christmas, the insides collapsed and combusted.  Oh human mind, how I love thee.  I decided life was bad.  And that was why we were all here.  To fail in life.  Bummer.  So yeah, I can't even describe myself at this point.  I didn't give a shit about anything or anybody.  Not even myself, most of all.  I pretended that I did.  So nothing would seem wrong to anyone.  I tried to be the same pre-December 11th Ben Blake the best I could.  I think I did a good job.  I eventually got back to the LiveJournal.  There were a lot of hating entries.  I tried to play it off as me just making jokes.  Funnies, if you will.  But they was fo realz.  That was what I felt.  Asshole.  Now it's January.  The crew is pretty much dead now, whether they want to admit it or not.  It was.  I go through everyday, hating the world.  Pretending I'm just fine and dandy.  When I'm very far from it.  And no one knows it.  Because there was one thing I still held on to.  Do not get personally attached.  So I held everything back from everyone.  And was killing myself psychologically in the process.  I bet none of you ever saw this coming, did you?  Well I don't want sympathy, I made it through just fine.  But this is all relevant for the rest of the entry.  Moving on.  Dan and Ashleigh aren't well anymore.  Ever.  And pretty much everyone knows it.  I believe it was at this point that Ashleigh wanted to die everyday.  Well one day I was thinking about them for some reason.  And it finally hit me.  And I couldn't believe that I was so stupid all this time to think Ashleigh was a bad person.  Ever.  So I eventually figured everything all out by myself, and February comes.  Yeah, like I trusted anyone anyways.  Now I really wasn't going to trust anyone ever.  But before February, I confessed something to Ashleigh.  And it felt good.  Because I knew she wasn't going to tell it to anyone.  I don't even remember what it was now.  But I liked it.  But I still wasn't going to get personally attached.  And plus, she had a boyfriend.  And shit.  Oh yeah, I went on this DC trip in the middle of January.  There was this chick that liked me there, and that made me feel important.  But that, of course, ended in tragedy.  Not good for my already-troubled mind.  So yeah, February comes in, and I'm still all, ""Fuck the motherfucking world you fucking pricks.""  Then the shit with Kat heats up again no thanks to Ashleigh.  And then I kind of went into hiding again.  But my mind was so far gone, it didn't matter.  I didn't care if my not-getting-attached attitude hurt anyone.  So I was mean to Ashleigh when she tried to bring that stuff up every night.  Little did I know she was pretty much doing me a favor.  Eventually I gave in, and confessed things to her.  Even though I told everyone I wasn't telling anyone anything ever.  But I broke it that night.  The next day, I was very confuzzled up in the head.  So I then went through this period where I was invisible online.  All the time.  Because I was afraid of what was going to happen next.  I was very afraid of being saved.  Because then I would become personally attached.  And break my cardinal rule.  And this is the part everyone has been waiting for.  Yeah, here comes the point of the entry; this is what really went down.  How everything unfolded and how everything happened.  The falling in love and whatnot.  Ya know.
Eventually, everyone found out that I was invisible.  So one day, I put this away message up.  It gave the name of a chatroom I created.  It had just me in it.  And during the whole night, only one person joined with me.  Her name is Ashleigh Marie Smith.  She said something that night, and I felt that I could confess in her.  But not just yet.  I wasn't entirely ready to trust someone completely.  Because that would have broke my cardinal rule, of course.  I eventually asked Kat to Semi, because I thought everyone was expecting it anyways.  Sorry Jason.  To be honest with you, you got there first.  Yeah, I'm not getting into that.  Eventually Kat is going out with Marc and shit.  This didn't sit too well with some people and stuff, but contrary to popular belief, I was indifferent towards the whole thing.  Some people thought I hated Marc and junk.  Not true.  I mean, it was different because it was a change and no one really saw it coming and it happened kind of fast and junk for the typical observer, but it was all fine and dandy.  Sure, the whole Semi thing looked kind of odd and shit with me going with her and stuff, but I was just planning on going as friends anyways, so there was no real difference.  So now for my psychological state.  Yeahhhh.  Not good.  Remember how I had that problem.  And I would just get mad at everything and everyone for a minute?  Well at this point, the minute lasted for several minutes.  Sometimes longer than that.  And I just had to stop everything I was doing.  To avoid saying something really bad, because I would have no reservations about anything.  The loneliness just evolved to this huge-ass black cloud on my mind, and I was just not a good person anymore.  Any way you looked at it.  And no one knew it.  I didn't tell anyone anything.  I didn't want to tell anyone anything.  Not just yet.  Eventually the end of February comes, and what happened before then isn't all that important.  Then March came.  There was this one day that I woke up.  I wanted to die, and I saw no point in keeping myself here.  It was March 1st, 2005.  I guess the loneliness and shit began to finally take over my mind.  But something happened that day that changed everything.  We had a snow day that day.  Woooooooo, go snow days!  Anyways, I remember waking up to the sound of my mother's voice telling me to get my punk-ass outside to shovel.  So I did.  And then I came inside.  I was feeling really severe depression I think.  I was going to run away that day.  Or the next day.  Whenever I had the chance.  To think things over and stuff.  Figure out what the hell I'm doing.  Because evidently I wasn't going anywhere here.  Ya know, usual teenage bullshit.  Okay, where was I.  Oh yes, I came back inside and went online.  I talked to Ashleigh.  And she made me laugh a real genuine laugh for the first time in a long time.  And then, the depression, it wasn't there anymore.  I still remember the song that was playing when I first noticed it was gone.  K-Ci & JoJo - ""All My Life"".  Irony here?  Yes.  I liked talking to her.  A lot.  So I kept doing it.  Everyday.  Around March 6th or 7th though, I made a decision.  You see, she pretty much admitted to me how she wanted to die everyday.  The worthless feelings she felt.  The entire lack of control she felt.  And I, being the supersleuth I am, knew exactly why.  So I decided to break one of my rules.  I would put another friend's happiness in jeopardy.  Because I knew Dan wouldn't like some of the things I was saying to her.  But I was going to try and keep it all a secret as long as possible.  To try and keep everyone happy of course.  For the first time in my life, I did something semi-selfish.  Because I wasn't only saving her.  I was saving myself.  But the fact that I was saving her.... that made my decision very easy.  I made her happy by just talking to her online.  I didn't want to take that away.  Plus, to any ordinary person, there's nothing wrong with that.  I thought of us just as friends at this point.  Nothing more.  I would think of us as nothing more than that for a while.  So I continue talking to her online and the whatnot.  I guess you could say we became good pals.  Even though we had the potential to do that for a long time.  But ya know, my whole ""don't get too close"" and ""keep everyone else happy"" bullshit kind of got in the way.  At this point I'm still having the psychological problems and whatnot.  But it's no biggie.  I came home from school everyday with something to look forward to.  Remember that huge-ass black cloud?  Well, it's starting to fade at this point.  I wasn't feeling as lonely anymore.  And I liked it.  Fast forward to Tuesday, March 15th.  We had an OTL game and stuff.  But afterwards, Ashleigh, John, my brother, and I all hung out in my car and her car.  Until about 11:30 PM.  It was most excellent.  Dan called several times, and I seen first-hand what it was like.  Not good.  I still didn't think of us as anything more than good pals.  So Semi is coming up and junk.  And just the thought of spending an entire night/morning with Ashleigh and Kat seemed very wonderful to me.  Even if I was going to be the odd-man-out there.  I didn't feel like that in a long time about anything.  It was weird.  But I liked it.  Just talking to her, I don't know.  It's hard to describe.  But it totally felt like I was a different person when I talked to her.  Like all the things that happened didn't matter.  Because I made her happy for the moment.  And she did the same for me.  It felt like a parallel universe kind of thing.  A place we could go to get away from the cruel world we were both facing.  Even though we were just on computers.  Ha.  Fast forward to Friday.  The night before Semi.  Many people know about this night; but what actually transpired, I don't think many people know at all.  But it changed the way I thought about everything.  Pretty much forever.  Okay, let's see.  Dan, Gordo, Sebas, me, and Ashleigh all went bowling.  Harmless enough.  Except towards the end, she sent me a message.  And we decided that I would go to Waterbury with her to pick up her brothers later.  Whether we was just going, just me and her, I did not know at this time.  But I didn't care, I was up for the adventure.  She kind of stole my car and junk when we were out in the parking lot.  With me in it.  Dan did not like this.  She just drove us around the parking lot and shit.  No biggie.  They had an argument after I left, I'm sure.  Yeah, I kind of figured then that Dan wasn't coming with us.  Ha.  But me and Ashleigh still went.  I didn't think either one of us knew what we were trying to accomplish here.  All I knew is that she made me smile like no one else did, and if I was her savior, then I wanted to be there for her.  As a good friend.  I still thought of us as just good pals at this point if you're wondering.  So we go pick up her brothers in Waterbury, blah blah.  We almost ran out of gas, but luckily we made it haha.  After this, we went to Kat's house.  Marc was there and stuff I think.  We didn't stay long.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  Just good pals.  Then we went back to the parking lot of Dunkin Donuts because that was where I left my car.  We talked for a little while.  It was nice.  Then I hugged her, and I was on my way home around 1:30 AM. Yikes.  The night was totally gangster.  And it made me feel good.  I liked it a lot.  Before this, from just talking, me and Ashleigh were like this:  [  ].  Pretty close.  After this whole episode, it felt as though we were like this:  [].  Because we both shared some sense of trust with one another.  And it was awesome.  When I got home, I talked to Kat.  And she gave me a whole new perspective on the whole situation.  She asked if I had feelings for Ashleigh, and I told her that I never thought of it in that way.  This was entirely true.  But then I did start thinking about it.  And in actuality, I didn't have to think about it.  I did.  She made me smile and laugh a way that no one could during that whole year.  There's always something about a person like this, that you just can't explain.  Ashleigh is that person for me.  I just never really thought of it in that way.  I was fine just being friends.  I knew the shit was going to hit the fan eventually, and I probably wasn't going to be allowed to talk to her by Dan.  Mainly because of the web of lies we dragged each other into.  We did this in order for all us to come out of the situation unscathed and junk.  But until then, I was ready to ride this thing out.  Because after I had come this far, I wasn't going to turn back now.  Turn back to the way I once felt; the life I was once living?  I think not.  I didn't care about the standards that I always held myself to. I decided it was time to make a change.  I wanted to be happy again.  The next day after my basketball game, I stayed around at Great Oak and talked to Ashleigh again for a while.  It was fabulous.  I don't even really remember what we discussed.  Or if we discussed anything at all.  Then uhhhhhh, at Semi.  Yeah, the shit hit the fan quite soon.  A lot sooner than any of us could have hoped.  Yeah, I'm sure a lot of people know the story by now.  I'm not going to be redundant and tell it again.  We'll fast forward to March 20th, the next day.  Me and Ashleigh were being totally gangster, and we were hiding out at Kat's house.  What was going to happen to us at this point, neither one of us really had a clue.  I wasn't even going to go to Kat's house that day.  I was just going to go home and go back to the life I once had.  Because it absolutely crushed me that I was ruining another person's life.  And I honestly couldn't look myself in the mirror.  Couldn't stand to look at the person I saw.  I had nowhere to turn.  And I was just going to go into solitary mode.  Again.  I can't even imagine what things would be like right now if that happened.  But point is, I gave into peer pressure and went to Kat's house.  Dan bothered everyone for the whole day.  And rightfully so.  I don't blame him.  But when Ashleigh came in from the whole car episode, I felt so bad for her.  I wanted to take her away from everything.  It didn't matter where we went.  As long as we went away from here.  And this wasn't because I had feelings for her.  It's because I was human, and I had a heart.  I've never seen fear in someone's eyes like I saw right there.  And she wasn't just shaking.  She was having fucking convulsions.  I obviously couldn't take her away.  So instead, when she sat next to me, I held her, and took her hand in mine.  We never looked back.  So yeah, Dan said a lot of inappropriate things to me on the phone that day.  I shed a few tears.  Not because of the things he was saying.  But because of the fact that I had hurt him so bad, that he felt he had to tell those things to me.  And the fact that I hated myself.  And what I had done.  Not only hated, but despised.  I had broken my two principles that I lived by.  And I got burned.  I was just trying to save a soul.  Not ruin one.  But things never work out the way you want them to.  I then saw Ashleigh the next couple days, and by next couple days I mean whenever I could.  Those next couple days are still continuing today.  There were a lot of gangster LiveJournal fights.  I promised myself and Ashleigh that I would not go after Dan in any way.  I felt I had already done enough.  No matter what he said to me, I wasn't going to go after him.  Does anyone know how hard it was to hold back?  No, I don't think so.  And there's no way you could ever understand.  So I'm not even going to try to explain.  This one night, I read a comment left by my good pal Dan.  It had something to do with what Ashleigh said one time when she was real pissed at me.  I'm sure he knows exactly which one.  It was planned out.  That one hurt a lot.  It hurt so much, that I was on the phone until about 3:10 that morning.  I called up Ashleigh, because she was the only one who could really help me.  And I asked her if the comment left was true.  She could have just said no, but I knew that it was true no matter what she said.  But she didn't say no.  She told me the truth.  And I felt I had to explain myself.  And for perhaps the first time in ten years, I broke down and starting crying.  I realized all that I had done.  What an asshole I really was.  To everyone.  And there was nothing I could do about it now.  But confessing everything to her, it made me kind of complete in a way.  And I'll never forget that ever.  It was at this point that I knew I wanted to be with her.  So she came over the next night to help me with my senior project.  Because it was due the next day.  So I picked her up in the middle of a blizzard.  Yeah, it wasn't a good idea.  But I didn't care.  I hoped she didn't either.  Yeah, I never really did that project that night.  I was banking on a snow day the next day.  And thanks to Adam Rozum, we got one.  Phew.  Then that night, March 24th.  The day before Good Friday.  I visited her at Dunkin Donuts, and by visit I mean sat with her in her car after she got out of work.  And it was at this point that we decided to make it official.  Me and her.  It was 2:08 AM.  So it was actually March 25th.  I remember I said, ""Will you go out with me?...""  Haha, totally lame.  And she said, ""Of course I will.""  Phew, had me hanging on the edge of my seat for a while there.  The next week or so, I was so torn apart over what happened and junk.  The lives I was ruining.  The crew I had killed.  But I had no regrets.  I knew one day I would be able to live in peace.  And if it was with her, it would be the best kind of peace imaginable.  Fast forward to Prom.  Oh Prom.  All the time before April 1st, me and Ashleigh kept the togetherness of me and her a secret from the world.  We didn't want certain suckas finding out.  But at Prom, Sean Plumb was there.  He is a good friend of Dan.  Was he there to spy on us fo realz?  I doubt it.  But would he tell Dan anything about what he saw?  It's a possibility.  So we decided we shouldn't really make it look like we were ""together"".  Even though we totally were.  But this was unknown to the rest of the world, of course.  But as we danced to a dance, she looked me in the eyes and said, ""Ya know what, I don't care if he finds out.  I hope he does.  And then we can tell the whole world.""  Then a couple minutes later, Richelle asked if we were together.  Ashleigh then looked at me, and then she told Richelle, ""Yes we are.""  And at that point, I pretty much fell in love.  I can't even describe.  I was so proud of her.  And I'll never forget that.  Ever.
So yeah, that's basically how everything happened.  How everything unfolded.  Those are my feelings, what I felt at the time and junk.  I provided this so you can see where I'm coming from.  Because I know that no one knows it but me.  Yeah, so this is pretty much the happiest I've been in my life ever.  Those psychological problems?  I haven't had them in a long time.  Whereas back in February I used to get them almost everyday.  She totally cured that shit.  What anyone thinks of me and her, I could care less.  Because where were they when I was shot and bleeding?  Not helping me.  What did everyone tell me to do, even my best friend?  Stay away from Ashleigh.  And there's no way I was doing that.  No way that I was going to listen to that bullshit.  Not after I came this far.  So I did what my heart was telling me to do.  Be with her.  And I basically said fuck everyone else.  What anyone thinks of me, I could care less.  I want to be with her, that's all.  Do I need anyone?  No, I don't think so.  I almost made it to my adulthood without ever growing entirely close to anyone.  And now that I have someone like that, I think I'm set for life.  Am I now more open and trusting of the world?  I think this entry answers that.  You can all thank Ashleigh for this new sense of trust.  She makes my life so beautiful, that everything else seems so trivial.  If I didn't have baseball, I would really be tempted to take a vacation with her and stuff.  And then marry her.  Yeah.  Totally.  Oh yeah, today is our one month anniversary.  This past month was the best I had in a long time.  Quite possibly ever.  Yeah, this probably isn't a good entry to leave on my anniversary and stuff.  But I just want everyone to realize how I fell in love.  And how I'm not really an ahole after all.  I was just trying to save a life.  The intentions was good.  The execution was not.  But I think my goal was still accomplished.  And in the process, she saved The President from self-destruction.  Fabulous.  I would totally do anything for her in a heartbeat.  Because I know she would totally do the same for me.  And that, my friends, is what love is.
Well I'm glad that I finally got all that off my chest.  Now I don't have to explain anything to anyone ever.  It's all right up there.  Keep secrets from people?  No longer applicable.  I'm leaving this wide open to the public for the whole world to read.  Yay!  So now we've discussed the past.  We've discussed the present.  I think all that leaves is the future.  I'm not a fucking mind reader or anything like that, so I don't really know what will happen in the future.  But I know at this point in time, I can honestly say that me and Ashleigh will be around for as long as we want to be.  There's nothing that can break us apart.  She can do what she wants.  I'm totally in love with her, and I know she feels the same.  And I know after all that we've been through, that no one can ever take my place.  Because no one will ever take hers.  She has a spot in my heart forever no matter what.  So will I love her forever?  It's a very good possibility.  I would say almost as good as the sun will rise tomorrow.  Because I am her sunshine.  And she is mine.  Always and forever.  Yeah, very good, indeed.  And Ashleigh, I know you've actually read all the way to the end of this entry.  You might be the only one, ha.  But I love you so much.  Like, holy shit.  Not to freak you out or anything haha.  Yeah, I really mean that even though it's only been one month.  Though it seemed like no time at all, it seems as though we was meant to be all along.  And I really do hope we last forever.  To be perfectly honest with you, I would really like to see you everyday for the rest of my life.  (""I Wanna Grow Old With You"" plays overhead.)
And that, my friends, is how I found love.  Tell your grandkids one day.  This was quite the epic.  You'll never read anything quite like this ever again.  How do I know?  Because people tell me all the time that I'm a unique, crazy fool.  After typing all this, I agree 100 percent.  I'm glad this fool found something to totally live for.  Forever.  <3 Times Infinity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","I ate food tonight, so I'm feeling kind of sick.  I don't know if I'm going to say much tonight.  We'll see how this goes.  You see, I was going to go to McDonald's with someone whose name may or may not be John.  But I was blown off.  Again.  It was no matter, I went anyways.  Then I drove around for about 3 hours.  I drove almost 60 miles.  It was a very lonely journey indeed.  I liked it.  Oh yeah, my mom said since I was ""so responsible"" this week with the car, I can drive it all I want on weekends.  Haha, suckers.
Yesterday before practice started, Coach Kelo told us he doesn't want to see anyone wearing anything with 'Seymour' written on it.  Because we don't deserve to wear it.  Apparently we've brought disgrace to not only our families like in old-school China, but also to the whole damn town.  Yessssssssssss, just what I always wanted to do.  So yeah, a lot of kids had to turn their pants and shirts inside-out and whatnot.  It was all very interesting.  Tomorrow we have a home game against Naugatuck.  This will be a HUGE-ASS victory if we win, because then we'll have a really good chance to sweep the week.  And it'll get us back to .500.  I think if we lose tomorrow, it'll be safe to say our season is shot.  Fuck.  Well I'm not going to play anyways, so I don't know why I'm worrying about it.  Haha.  Bill Chulak informed me the other day that this is it for baseball for him.  Last season and shit.  He's giving up on it after this high school season.  Sure, he may not be the best player, but he's pretty much dedicated all his free time to baseball and stuff.  Whenever I see Chulak, I think catcher.  In baseball of course, you pervs.  Anyways, he doesn't even catch anymore.  So now he's decided it's time to pack it in.  I don't really know what I'm going to do after this high school season.  But there's a fairly good chance that this may be it for me too.  I don't really see myself going anywhere.  Baseball is pretty much the only thing keeping me in school right now.  But I don't feel my heart in it like it once was.  I told you all that this year has been quite rough.  One day it just hits you that there's nowhere else to go, and it's time to give it up.  I'm not at that point yet.  But one day it'll come.  It could be tomorrow.  It could be the day after that.  And it'll be very sad.
Today the ten day streak that I've seen Ashleigh will end.  It started last Thursday when we went to the mall with Kristine and Sebas.  So that means I saw her every day this vacation except for today.  But if she keeps coming to see me while she's sick, I'm going to be forced to go into hiding.  Juuuusst kidding.  Except I'm not.  Tomorrow is going to be a neat day, no matter what happens.  I don't remember why.... heh heh.  And I wonder if any of you do?....  As for what I did today.  Today I went and saw my other girlfriend Colleen instead.  Anyways, I guess you can call this vacation a win for me.  Except for today, of course.  Today was a loss.  But the overall vacation was definitely a win.  As Vince Lombardi once said:  ""Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing."""

People may think my journal entries now suck.  You are all probably right.  But I warned everyone of this.  In entry number 100 I think.  I said how once baseball started, I would be tired all the time.  And chances are, my entries would be a bit dry if they were existant at all.  Oh well.  You'll get over it one day.  As for now, go get in shape and be happy.  Because life's a movie.  Go with it and enjoy it :-)"

"event","We lost to Kennedy today 8-2.  The coaches said it was the worst game they've ever seen while coaching at Seymour.  We didn't do the things we were coached to do.  At all.  I don't get it.  Last game we looked like we could take on anyone.  Bummer.  If we hit 20 ground balls today, 18 of those kids would have gotten on base.  Yeah, they couldn't play.  We should have buried those fuckers.  I pinch hit for Jack Smith in the sixth inning.  I struck out looking.  I could give a really good excuse here that's actually viable, but I'm not going to.  Excuses are for losers.  There's always something more that you can do.  Then an excuse won't be necessary, because you'll get it done.  I didn't get it done today.  Bottom line.  I had a chance to steal Lampart's spot at DH.  And I didn't do it.  Strike outs don't help in any way.  And that's all there is to it.  The end."

"event","It was so weird yesterday.  My dad was bringing me and my brothers somewhere to eat when all of the sudden I had a flashback kind of thing.  We were heading up the driveway when all the sudden, I saw John running down the street.  Just like he used to do everyday when he used to live up the street back in the days.  Except this John looked so real.  Then I figured out it really was John running down my street.  With no shirt on.  He was running because he decided that he can't afford a gym membership, so he was getting in shape this way.  And my street was the halfway point.  Haha, awwww John <3!  I love that kid.  Like wabam.  We've been around for a long time.  Ain't nobody ever gonna break us up.  No matter how far apart one may think we're becoming.  Ten years from now, we'll still be best pals.  Guaranteed.  Wow, pretty much everyone that's important (haha just kidding, Ashleigh isn't important ;-) ) was over my house yesterday.  Without invitations.  I must be loved or something.  Yessssssssss...
Last night I walked to John's house.  He met me halfway there or close to it.  Neat.  Yeah, I don't need no darn car.  And shit.  Because then later on, some fool <3 picked me up anyways, and then after that I went home.  I should have fallen asleep around 7:30.  However, I stayed awake so that fool could pick me up around 11.  I pretty much drowned myself in iced tea and Pepsi to stay awake.  I also worked out to get the horomones flowing in me and took two showers.  I stayed awake for the most part.  It was a good experience.  But as it turns out, plans got screwed anyways.  But things turned out just fine.  They always do.  Wow, that was a neat story.  I'll have to tell it again sometime.
Okay I usually don't do this because I forget birfdays a lot.  But I actually remembered this one for some reason... You can even ask Ashleigh.  I remembered around 12:10 yesterday morning.  Happy birthday Colleen!!! Yessssssss!  This must be a sign or something ;-) (I totally had this one paragraph typed out this afternoon before we went out and stuff.  Yeah, I don't what I'm trying to say.  I'm special, leave me alone.)
Today I went to the mall with Ashleigh and Gordo.  John was supposed to go with us, but he ditched us.  Gordo drove.  We went so me and Gordo could get our psychology project done and shit.  I don't really remember what it was, but if I did, I would tell you.  Neither one of us read the chapter.  So we had no clue what the fuck was going on.  Ashleigh is so smart though, that she totally did like the whole thing for us.  Then I drove Gordo's car kind of home or some shit.  In the past four days, I've driven other people's cars three times.  Three different cars.  Three different people.  Suckers....  Then we celebrated Colleen's birfday with her at Chili's with Kat and a shitload of other people.  Then we went to Andrew Phillip's house with that same shitload of people plus like 5 more.  Or something.  I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention.  Some punks made me order food at Chili's.  And food and I don't really get along these days.  So I wasn't feeling too hot afterwards.  So then me and Ashleigh left Drew Phillip's house like way before everyone else.  She was tired.  I was feeling sick and kind of tired.  I liked it.  Haha.  Then we uhhhhhhhhhh, got coffee and stuff.  Yeahhhhhhh.  Coffee <3.  That made my stomach feel much better.  Phew.  So yeah, that project never really got done.  At all.  Darn.  As for now, I have a game tomorrow morning at 11.  It's home against Kennedy.  You may come if you want.  I'm really hoping that I get another chance.  Third time's a charm <3!  I love you sweety.  A lot.  Just thought I would let you know just in case you didn't pick up on that yet.  Don't matter what anyone thinks about us.  We'll last as long as we want."

He also has white on his face.  He's a cat.  I was going to adopt him, but then I decided to start running away.  I got about a mile through the gangster streets of Seymour, when someone in a red car picked me up.  Phew.  Then at one point I ended up driving the car.  Weeeiiirrdd.
We beat Ansonia today 3-0.  We played fairly well.  We made most of the routine plays.  Jeff Glowa pitched well for the whole game.  Defense + Pitching = Victory.  It's a pretty simple equation.  Now we're back at .500.  Neatoooooo.  I didn't play.  Lampart started at DH again.  I was going to pinch hit for Jack Smith in the 4th inning, but at the last second Kelo decided against it.  I was also going to pinch hit in the bottom of the sixth if the batting order got to the number 5 hitter, but unfortunately the inning ended on batter number 2.  Bummer.  When I came home from the game, there was a suprise waiting for me.  I liked it a lot.  She kind of gave the suprise away when she said my mom wasn't home.  But I was totally suprised anyways.  Yay.  Then we had a foul shooting contest and we tied with 6 out of 10 each.  I guess this means we both get neat prizes.  Yesssssssss!  What is going on for the rest of my day, I do not know.  But what I do know is I have yet to eat anything today.  Except two pieces of gum at the game.  So now I'm going to do that.  Goodbye everyone!"

"event","Last night was neat.  It was a good night.  That one night totally makes this whole vacation worth it.  Most of the credit goes to John.  Some to Ashleigh.  And I suppose a litte bit to Kyle.  John and I kidnapped Ashleigh and Kyle around 9.  Then John drove all over the place while I blasted my G-Unit CD.  I liked it.  He almost killed us a bunch of times, but I knew we weren't going to die.  Basically because God is always on my side.  And now Ashleigh's too.  So don't mess.  Because he will smite you.  Just wait for it.  Let's see, I would tell about the trip, but to be honest, I wasn't paying attention where we were going.  When John asked me which way to go, I just gave him a random direction.  It all worked out.  See, told you God was on my side.  All I know is we ended up at the Waterbury mall in the middle of the trip.  They close at 9:30.  So nothing was open.  Darn.  I got home around 11.  Curfew obeyed two nights in a row.  Yessssssssss.  Since my car has gotten taken away from me for all the good grades I received on my report card, I've gone out every night.  ....Suckers.
There's a new Pope.  He's from Germany.  He's going to take the name Benedict.  Then they'll put a bunch of random Roman numerals after it.  I heard this on the way home from baseball.  I had the radio cranked up at Star 99.9, when all of the sudden they interrupted my music for some big announcement from the Vatican.  Fags.  I was mad.  It was all in French or some crap language, so I couldn't even understand it.  Gosh.  I don't like the name Benedict.  ""Ben a dick.""  Get ittttttttttt??  Ha, just kidding.  Today I came home from baseball and I got a really good idea.  I was all, ""Hey, since I had so much fun at practice today, how about I go lie in the middle of the road and pray that a car comes by.""  Then the other half of me agreed.  But you see, Sean Burke kept distracting me with stupid questions, so I might have a missed a car.  We don't get many on my street, so we have to cherish the ones that do come by.  It's a really rare occasion.  But I eventually got out there.  So I'm all lying down on the asphalt, when I'm like, ""Holy shit, this shit is hard.""  Though it wasn't really shit, it was asphalt.  But I said shit anyways.  So I take my shirt off and use that as a pillow.  Oh, good thinking Ben (pats self on back).  So I'm lying out there for about a half hour or so, and no cars are coming.  I think I might have fell asleep at one point or something, because all of the sudden my mom was all up in my grill.  She was like, ""Boy, you get yo' punk-ass inside before I give you's a spankin!""  Well, it wasn't those exact words.  Just something along those lines.  Lying in the sun is fun.  I'm going to do it more often.  I rhymed two sentences ago without even trying.  The hip hop world better watch out.  I'm done now.  Let's hope for another neat entry tomorrow.  Laterrrrrrrrrrrrrr."

The kid after that walked.  And the kid after that got a hit, and we lost 3-2.  We let another fucking game get away.  We should be sitting on 4-1 right now.  But instead of 4-1, we are now 2-3.  I really hate not playing.  Chris Lampart and Chris Plumb have been the DH for the last 10 at-bats.  They've gone 0-9.  Perhaps one day, I shall play again.  I can only hope for another shot.

"event","Today I was sleeping in the grass waiting around for some red car to come, when my mom told me a story about when I was a young lad.  We did a lot of yard work today.  I raked leaves and shit in the back.  But anyways, she was picking weeds when she thought of this story for some reason.  When I was a little boy, I got really mad at my mom for a forgotten reason.  She probably wouldn't take me to get a movie or something.  So she had these dandelions all planted right in a little circle around a tree.  And there was this girl up the street who would always come down to my house, and try to slice the heads off with a golf club.  But she would always miss, and we would yell at her.  Eventually she gave it up.  But I was like 7, and I was like, ""Whoa what a great idea this girl had.""  So I took a golf club, and sliced all the heads off.  My mom said they were almost perfect cuts too.  Haha, perhaps I was a golf prodigy.  Like Tiger Woods.  Except better.  I guess the world will never know.  This story is courtesy of Ashleigh because she's the one who told me to post it in here.  I have nothing else to say at this point.  I'll let Stat Quo say it all.

"event","As many of you know, I've been lying to my parents a lot lately.  I know they know it.  But I do it anyways.  I felt like it was all totally worth it.  But I got a note today from my momma when I got home from practice.  I'll type it word fo word right here for you.  If there's grammatical or spelling errors, I apologize.  They're not mine.

Just so you know Ben, when you've trusted someone for as long as I've trusted you, and then that someone feels the needs to continuously lie to you, it hurts.  I'm tired of feeling hurt.  It's not that I don't care anymore, or that I'm not proud of you.  I just feel very let down.  I can't continue to let you hurt me by not trusting me to make responsible decisions.  I've put alot of blood, sweats and tears into your 18 years on this earth, and I think I've done a pretty damn good job.  And because you seem to think otherwise, just breaks my heart.
I'll always care about you, Ben, just remember that.  But because you seem to know the best way to run your life, go for it!  I'll always be here to help pick up the pieces, if it should come down to that.
Mom

Well, at least I know my momma has read my LiveJournal.  I don't know if she's been reading it all along, or just today or whatever.  Hmmmmm.  Well mom, if you're reading this, I would like to place a response to your note, even though you just took my keys 10 minutes ago.  I didn't get that.  Anyhoo, I do trust you mother.  I lie to you, because I don't want you to get hurt.  I made these choices to lie because I saw it as the best way for both of us to try and come out of this unscathed.  Unfortunately, it didn't happen that way for either of us.  And I said all those things about you not caring about me and all that mainly out of frustration.  You were a teenager once too.  You know what it's like.  I'll try to tell you funny stories more often.  I'm loaded with em as always.  I've just been catching you at bad times.  And you did do a damn good job of raising me.  I'm the President of Seymour High School.  Can't beat that silly.  Fordham is giving me like $20,000 a year.  It's hard to beat that too.  Do you know why I don't want any part of college at all?  Probably.  But I'll tell you anyways.  It's because it's going to be nearly impossible to say goodbye to you and the life that I had here.  I have no reason to leave.  You and Dad are simply wonderful, and I thank God all the time that you guys stick around for me and the other kiddies.  I do trust you to make responsible decisions.  But I'm constantly asking myself is the responsible decision what I want right now.  It's just so hard to obey your wishes.  This year has been tough.  And right now, this is pretty much the happiest I've ever been ever.  And I just don't want to lose it.  And thus, irrational decisions are made.  It was so hard to disobey you.  Because I know it hurts you.  Which, in turn, hurts me.  My mind is at constant war.  Unfortunately, the angel keeps losing.  Hopefully in the end, it'll all work out.  You don't have to worry about me, Mom.  I'll be fine.  I always am.  But your concern is appreciated.  I love you Mommy.  There's no one else who will have the same love that I have for you.  Ever."

Bob Kelo is not a happy man.  We won today 14-6.  But yet, he is not a happy man.  Tomorrow's practice shall be interesting.  Especially since like the whole team is going to the varsity practice.  Instead of going to the JV game.  It should only be about 4.5 hours long.  I didn't play today.  Yeah, I was hoping this day would never come.  Damn.  We'll see what happens next week.  Not playing today bothered me a lot.  Last year, I didn't really care if I played or not.  Maybe one at-bat every other game or so would have been nice, which was pretty much what I got.  But last year I didn't really feel like I had anything to play for.  So I didn't give a shit.  I give a shit this year.  Not because I'm a senior, and it could totally be my last season ever.  But because right now, this year... I totally have someone to play for <3 <3"

I got an A+ for six test grades because of me and Kim Hricz's awesome job on our Psychology presentation.  Yeah, we pretty much nailed that shit.  I would say what parts I conjured up, but since everyone in that class thinks I do no work, I'm not going to bother.  Baseball sucked horribly.  But I'm over it.  Tomorrow we have a game against Wolcott.  If we don't win, I don't think I'm ever going to come back ever.  Then tonight, I went to the mall with Sebas, Kristine, and Ashleigh.  It was absolutely wonderful.  I haven't been to the mall on the Post Road in about eleven years.  Actually that's a lie if you couldn't tell.  But it's been a while.  Maybe two years or so.  I almost killed us in the car.  Mainly because I'm blind.  But I'm over it.  Then some jek forgot to eat, and was hungry, so now I'm here kind of obeying my curfew and typing this totally fab entry.  However, I must read Psychology now because I'm so gangster.  I decided that since there's only two chapters left, I might as well get at least one of those tests above a 90.  88 is the highest score I've achieved thus far this year.

Today we got our asses handed to us by Holy Cross.  Holy Cross beat the holy crap out of us.  Yesssssssss.  I did not like it.  We have no leadership.  We pretty much gave up on the game in the second inning.  Coach Kelo said it was the most shameful game he's ever seen.  I tend to agree.  Yeah, we need someone to take the reigns of this team.  Or we're going to crumble in every game like we did today.  I would try to lead the team, but I'm more of a leader by example.  And since I kind of suck, I don't really have any example to lead by.  Bummer.  Yeah, we got beat 14-4.  I batted 6th and went 0-2.  I hit a bloop line drive directly at the center fielder.  He didn't even have to move.  And then in my next at-bat I crushed a pitch straight at the right fielder.  If he wasn't standing there, I'm pretty sure that ball would still be rolling as I type this.  I can't get bloopers to fall for me.  And when I hit it hard, they don't fall either.  Yeah, the baseball gods hate me.  Which is fine.  They'll be on my side someday.  Perhaps.  Probably not.  It appears everyone always is.  It's too bad I'll probably never get a chance to play again.  Oh well, life goes on.  
After the game tonight, I went out with John.  John is feeling very lonely and left out I think.  So tonight I went out with him.  Kinda sorta.  We sat in a parking lot, ate cinammon buns, and drank Pepsi.  Yeah, how gay does that sound?  Haha, whatever, you can think what you want.  Then we went to Great Oak.  I forget why ;-).  As for now, I'm on the phone with uhhhhhhhhh.... John!  And my shoulder is getting sore from holding the phone to my ear.  We're gonna die at practice tomorrow.  And that's the way it is.

I have extra clothes still in my car as I type this.  But I decided against it.  Thanks to some outside influence.  It just makes me mad that everyone tries to take Ashleigh away from me, or looks down upon us.  Just let us live in peace yo.  God said we deserve so much more.  Well the priest said that.  I'll agree, because for some reason God is always on my side.  Phew.
Yesterday when I wrote my journal entry, I must have been going through a tough time.  I was being a little punk ass bitch who was complaining about everything.  Once I calmed down and got my panties out of a bunch, I wisened up and realized how wonderful life really is at this point in my life.  I always say everything will turn out fine.  Maybe I should start listening to myself.  Game against Holy Cross tomorrow.  First I have to hope that I'm in the lineup.  Then I have to show that I belong there.  It'll be close.

Then the shit was all going down.  I had a calculus test.  Failed for sure.  7th period Psychology I hate a lot.  Mainly because I can't remember why I took this shit in the first place.  I don't like it.  Then we had a game at Woodland Regional High School.  It was so fucking cold and windy.  And we lost 3-2.  Coach Kelo said he expected us to get our asses handed to us today.  But we should have totally stolen that game.  A loss is a loss.  No one that looks at the standings two weeks from now will see the valiant effort we put in.  Only if we win.  I started at DH again and batted fourth.  I went 0-3.  Two groundouts to short, and a fly out to right.  The groundouts were hit hard, but directly at the shortstop.  And the fly ball went fairly far for a ball off the handle.  But an out is an out.  And I might as well have struck out three times.  We'll see if I start next game.  I doubt it.  I got a chance, I choked, and I fucked it up.  Bitch.  Then other shit went down that would have normally made me laugh and I would probably just shrug it off.  But it just pissed the hell out of me.  I'm not going into any of this.  Then a couple minutes ago my fuckin Winamp broke.  Like I really need this bullshit.

"event","I had to make my college decision today.  It was very hard to deny Villanova.  But I did.  Many might see it as the wrong decision and might view this as very stupid.  I know I do.  But I'm pretty sure I'll be happier at Fordham.  But I'll probably second-guess my decision forever.  But it'll be better this way I'm pretty sure.  It's why I picked it you sillies.  There were many factors that went into my decision.  If I understood all of them, I would probably go into them now.  However, I don't really understand my logic.  Ever.  So therefore, we'll just leave it at that.  So my college decision is made.  And that's the end of that.
Today I told my mom I was going to Gordo's to study math.  Which actually was the truth for once.  But as I was leaving, she was like, ""Okay, we'll see you Monday morning.""  Haha, I think they've given up on me.  It wouldn't suprise me if they knew that I broke my curfew every night.  But you see, a funny thing happened last night as I broke it for about the 37th time in a row.  I realized that it didn't matter to me anymore.  Ya know, betraying my parents and lying to them and all.  The night was just so wonderful, I'm pretty sure I could hold on to that forever.  And if they asked about it today, I don't think I would have even lied about it.  Yeah, so it was fantastic and all that.  And I don't think I'll even lie anymore.  Because once you find something this great, you don't really see the point in lying anymore.  Because you're content either way.  And it's awesome.
I went to Gordo's to study calculus tonight.  I need a 92.5 or higher on tomorrow's test to get a 70 for the quarter.  Basically everyone, I'm fucked.  Ehhh, there's nothing I could do now.  This year wasn't good.  And I dug myself into a hole so deep in several subjects, that it's very much impossible to climb out of it.  Like, I can't even see a glimpse of light anymore.  But now, school doesn't matter much to me.  I got other shit now.  And it's not shit at all.  No sir.  Just the opposite.  There's baseball.  And then there's uhhh, well, you all know by now.  And if you don't............ <3 times infinity for Ashleigh, duh!

"event","I did a whole hell of a lot of nothing today.  I liked it.  I had varsity practice first thing this morning.  Yeah, we had eight kids stay for the varsity practice.  Everyone else went to the JV game.  I guess you could say our team isn't the best team talent-wise that the Wildcats have ever put out there.  No sir.  I got fuckin nailed in the elbow at practice by a foul tip off of Bobby Bengivengo's bat.  It was not fabulous.  And still isn't.  That's enough complaining about that.  Coach Kelo told me today that I am our DH, and we're going with ten batters next game.  So at least I'll be in the lineup again.  And remain in the lineup until I prove myself unworthy there.  Which I cannot do, because this is where I really want to be.  I'm pretty sure no one can convince me that I do not belong here, because I've already convinced myself that I do belong here.  And I trust my word over almost everyone else's.  Yeah I was going to say something else about practice, but I have forgotten.  It was obviously not important.  Is it ever?  Ha, just kidding.  So after practice, I saw the end of the JV game, and then I came home.  Coooooooooooooooool.
I was kind of tired all day today.  Can't imagine why....  I was going to wash my car, but then I decided to be lazy and didn't.  Suprise!  It's been a long week.  I was owed an afternoon/night like this.  I think I was supposed to hang out with John, but I said I would call him around 4.  And I forgot.  Whoa, another big suprise.  So yeah, I remembered around 7:30, and haven't been able to get a hold of him.  I would have remembered if I could focus on something other than... uhhhh, turkey sandwiches.  Yeah, damn those things.  But I love them so much.  Gives me goosebumps.  I would tell you what else I did today, but I can't really remember, and I'm almost positive that it was nothing at all.  Wow, I'm so fly.  You know it.  I'm pretty sure my parents have given up on me.  And trying to have a little control over what I do.  So as for right now, I'm going to get some coffee or something.

"event","We had our first high school baseball game today.  We played Watertown.  No one expects us to win any games this year.  Our coach doesn't.  The newspapers don't.  Hell, half of our team probably doesn't think we'll win over five games.  But today my friends, we defeated Watertown 5-1.  Suckas.  Remember how I said yesterday that I didn't think I was going to play at all today?  Well I had that same attitude this morning.  Not fabulous.  So I brought my shitty cleats and an unwashed uniform.  It did not smell fabulous.  But as I was about to head onto the bus, I went to see what chart I had to keep.  And in the #5 spot on the batting order, I saw something I'll never forget.  It looked like this.
5___DH  Ben Blake               32
____LF  Jack Smith              29
I was DH-ing for Jack Smith.  In the number 5 spot.  Wooooo.  Last year I had two varsity at-bats.  I walked both times.  But this was my first start.  So I finally got a shot, and I knew I couldn't fuck it up.  I would probably forgive myself never if I did.  So the first inning we go down 1-2-3, so up first in the second inning was Jeff Glowa and then myself.  Glowa grounded out to first, and then I was up.  First pitch was a fastball right down the middle of the plate.  And I didn't miss.  I hit a line drive straight over the pitcher's head, and thus the Wildcats had their first hit and first baserunner of the 2005 season.  The next two times up I fucked up real bad.  I don't think the coaches know it, phew.  The second time up I was about a whole second ahead of the ball and hit a little dribbler to third base.  The third time up I barred my right arm out on a fastball down the middle and hit a nubber to the pitcher.  I need a really big game now.  So then they won't take me out unless I do something real bad.  Oh baseball, how I love thee.
Actually being a part of the lineup for the high school team is something very special to me.  It's like all the lifting and work in the offseason finally pays off when you get that chance to play.  It feels like I have a direct influence on the goal we're trying to achieve.  Get to that postseason.  And as a matter of fact, I do.  We're 12.5% of the way there, and we have 19 more games to get the other 87.5% and win the final 7 games.  Yeah, I forgot what else I wanted to say here.  Something about pride and shit like that.  I've probably said it all before.  I'm an asshole.
Tonight was a good night.  Dan and Jess I'm sorry about tonight.  I didn't mean to cause pain.  Kirstin told me briefly on Monday that you fellas were going bowling, but this was such a long week, and I have other more important things to focus on than where everyone is at every moment.  So I totally forgot with all the baseball and schoolwork and G-Unit training.  As for the rest of the night.  The rest of the night was just fine.  And by just fine I mean freakin awesome.  That's all I have to say about that."

"event","School is so boring and pointless now to me.  There's only one thing I want to do now.  But I can't do this one thing, because we's can't think of a place to go.  I don't know if we have any where to go.  So hence, we're still here.  Bummer.
Lou Roberts and Chris Michaels have a new idea for me.  A new vision, if you will.  They want me to record an album.  And do all cover songs.  I'm thinking I'm gonna rap 80's pop hits.  That would be sweet.  We'll call it Ben Blake Sings.  Except the 'Ben Blake' will be in huge capital letters [BEN BLAKE], while the 'Sings' will be in very small lowercase letters underneath [sings].  What a retarded idea.  Perhaps one day I will follow through.  Whoa, what a fabulous idea I just came up with.  I'll run away to 50's house, become his protege, and then record this album.  Gangster.  I won't even need one of them license thingies to record my cover songs, because let's face it, people love me.  ""Like a fat kid love cake.""  Haha, Fiddy here I come.
Our first game is tomorrow against Watertown.  I'm probably not going to play because I suck ass.  It's supposed to rain, and that's a good thing because we suck ass.  We have no skills, no pitching, no star players, no leadership, and no pride.  All the key components to a championship-caliber team are pretty much missing.  I never did things the traditional way anyways, so why start now?  Yeah, we're going undefeated.  Oh, I mean unvictorious.  Yeah, same difference.
Life is sweet.  Nothing really bothers me too much anymore.  Only two things.  The first is my parents.  They always used to tell me in the beginning of the year up until around Christmas to try to be happy.  And shit like that.  Then my grades had a major falling out, and they kinda left me alone.  Right now, I am truly happy, and they've ironically lost all respect for me.  The only time I can really remember my parents being in a state of shock and pride from something I did was when I won the Presidency.  And when I won the home run derby freshman year haha.  I just want them to be happy and proud of me all the time.  Now onto the second thing.  The second thing is anything that makes Ashleigh unhappy.  This is no friend of mine.  You can hate me all you want, but please leave her alone.  Thank you kindly.  So in conclusion, life is sweet, and so are *you*.  Farewell."

"event","Remember yesterday how I said it was the hardest day of baseball I had thus far in my entire life?  Well, I would like to take that back.  Today was the hardest day of baseball thus far by far.  None of you know what foul poles are, so I'm not going to try to explain, except I had to do 5 of them.  In 1:50.  And if that meant something to you, your jaw would drop to the floor.  Foul poles are probably the very thing that causes quitting the baseball team.  I have a feeling we're going to lose some kids after today.  Because only 25% of our team passed the first round of foul poles.  Then everyone else had to run more after practice.  I'm not complaining or anything.  Just saying how the Seymour Baseball program has been run into the ground.  If I wasn't a senior, I would seriously consider quitting after today.  But I won't do that.  Because someone doesn't want me to.  I like this someone.  I will obey their wishes.
Yeah, disobey your parents, and they'll give you more freedom.  Haha, that's the message I'm getting.  You see, yesterday I wasn't supposed to go on the computer.  But I did.  And eventually, I got yelled at for it.  And I'm on once again today, obviously.  Haven't gotten yelled at for it yet.  Obviously.  I'm also supposed to never leave my house after baseball, and I am not allowed to use the phone.  My cell phone also got taken away.  Why all this happened is not important.  Bottom line is my parents do not want me communicating with anyone.  Fuck that shit, they don't control me.  So last night, I used the telephone, and got caught.  I got yelled at, but continued to use the phone for another half hour or so, because my silly father just went upstairs and didn't bother to see if I hung the phone up or not.  So then today, I come home.  And my dad goes to me, ""Your mother and I decided that you can use the phone until 11:00 from now on.  But then you have to go to bed.""  I was suprised; grammatically correct and everything.  Yeah, I don't really get it.  Maybe they think because they give me an inch, I'll obey their bullshit rules....hmmmmmmmm........... Nahhhhhh.  Once report cards come out, I'm dead.  Calculus makes me sad.  AP Psych makes me sad.  The rest of my classes are fine.  Maybe if I wasn't such an asshole, and I decided to dedicate my life to school work, I could do well.  But instead, I spend all my time with people.  With baseball.  With music.  And updating this journal.  You should all feel very special.  I know I do.
When I think about what I do everyday, I get very confused.  I get no sleep.  I rarely sleep in school.  But yet, I get through school, baseball practice, and then go to bed around 1.  On a good day.  Haha.  I forgot what I was going to try and say with this paragraph.  Maybe it was.... Don't complain, because no one cares?  No, that wasn't it, but it's a good message.  I used to work with this kid Lenny when I worked at the restaurant.  When he was in high school, he played football, indoor track, and baseball for Naugatuck.  He used to go to school, go to practice, and then work from 9 PM-2 AM at Stop & Shop five days a week.  Then he would sleep from 3 or whenever he got home to around 5:30.  Every damn day.  He was all-state in baseball and indoor track, and started both offense and defense for the football team.  He got a full scholarship for indoor track to some school that I can't remember the name of right now, but he went to culinary school instead.  So yeah, what I'm trying to say is when everyone complains of their ""tough"" schedules and how tired they are, I think of Lenny.  Because what he did five days a week is just not human.  And no one really has anything to complain about unless they can top that shit.  Which I'm pretty sure is not possible.  Farewell, my 'rents are going to kick me off soon."

This weekend has opened my life to a whole new thing.  And I like this thing a lot.  I would try to explain it, but I can't.  You just have to experience it for yourself.  Which would probably be very hard, considering all that's happened.  But after this weekend, nothing really bothers me as much as it used to (Used to = last week n shit).  Unless it bothers Ashleigh.  Then I'm sad.  But otherwise, say and think what you want about me.  No one can understand where I'm coming from.  Perhaps John or Ashleigh, but that's it.  Like Obie Trice said...
""Bitches they gon' talk.  Niggas they gon' hate.  We established this way before we became mates.""
No retaliation here.  Maybe I'll try to justify myself if you're way out of line.  But I will not try to hurt you in any way.  Otherwise, I probably won't respond to you at all.  Because as of right now, everyone seems very dim to me.  And then there's this one bright spot.  Yeahhh, as bad as that may sound.  I don't think less of anyone, though.  Just very very highly of that one person.  Anything she wants... she's got it.  Just like Roy Orbison sang.  Something to look forward to and live for everyday is a great feeling.  And then when you have this sense of trust, and you know that they feel the same way... that just makes it the best feeling ever.  If this entry sounds sappy, tough.  It's the way I feel, and it's what I want to say.  I like it a lot.  And I wouldn't have it any other way.  No regrets, my love.  No regrets...
This year's been rough.  No one even has any clue what I've been going through.  It's very lonely at the top, I guess.  Haha, just kidding.  But as of right now... yeah I can't even begin to describe.  Wow, it's been a really long time since I've felt this way.  Full and complete and stuff.  Actually, this might be the first time ever.  I can't really remember.  But it's awesome.  Maybe because the Yankees won tonight.  Or it could be the arrival of baseball and spring.  Or something else associated with spring... Anyways, this was truly my first ""rambling"" entry in a long time.  Hey everyone, guess what!  I'm back bitches!!!!!"

The second is going to be my scrimmage.  Which I have to leave super duper early.  So I probably won't even play.  And then the third will be tonight at this here prom.  I like it.  I went to Gordo's house right after school today to get my birfday present from him and John.  They got me a bunch of stuff in a Barbie bag.  The bag contained a lot of Easter candy that was 75% off at Walgreens.  And it also contained things to uhhhh.  Hmmm.  Lemme think how John worded it on the card.  ""Be cool.  Wrap your tool.  If ya know what I mean.""  Yeahhhhhhhhhhh.  I'm glad they still don't look at me differently like a lot of other people after all that's happened.  <3 to both of them.  The only other thing I got for my birfday was a 40 GB iPod.  Which probably cost about 4 million dollars.  Because that thing has more memory than this computer I'm typing on right now.  But for now I must go and warmup for a scrimmage.  And then come home.  Wooooooo.  I hope neat entries come in the future.  Because these ones suck.  I just don't have time.  Because I'm an asshole.

It got torn up and thrown away because those assholes wait-listed me.  Not fabulous.  I had a scrimmage today against Derby.  I had one at-bat, and I played 5 innings in left field.  I lined out to third, and not one ball got hit to me.  That's not fabulous either.  And now I'm apparently an adult.  Totally not fabulous.  At least deep down inside, I'll be a kid forever.

I went in pretty cold, considering I rehearsed what I was going to say zero times.  I'm a dipshit.  A lot of people in the class liked it I think.  I drew on the board and stuff, and it was good.  It's quite unfortunate that you missed it.  Ellen Marcantonio's (my teacher) comments were as follows:
""Mr. Blake, you have a good sense of humor.  You make very good use of it.  Don't ever lose that quality.""

If you think this entry is aimed at you, first of all, that's plain arrogant.  And second of all, it's correct.  It's aimed at every single one of you.  And you will like it.  
Ya know what would be neat?  If people used a brain sometimes.  Yeah, that would be really neat.  People honestly need to think before they speak.  Or voice their opinion.  Or whatever.  Why haven't I really voiced mine on anything controversial?  Because my intentions are not to hurt anyone.  Not to start anything with anyone.  Not to make someone feel bad about himself/herself.  I'm pretty sure if I wanted to, I could ruin a life or two.  But that thought has never ever crossed my mind.  Ever.  Nothing ever works out the way you want it to.  No one is ever quite the way you expect.  Ever hear ""expect the unexpected""?  Yeah well, it's true.  Whatever can go wrong, will.  That's like Boyle's Law or something.  So what are my intentions?  The people that know me deep down inside... there aren't many of them.  But they say I care too much about other people.  And very little about myself.  This is probably true.  I always want the people around me to be happy.  Other people know it.  No one can deny it.  That's probably why I let stupid things bother me so much.  I always tell myself I have to set the example for others... I have to always maintain my composure.  I can't let anything bother me.  But I did.  I blew it.  And now everyone hates me.  But if they knew everything that went into the equation, all the parts; then I think they would have a different opinion.  
When you get old in life, things get taken from you.  But for every single thing that gets taken from you, that opens up a slot for something else.  There's always room for improvement.  Some may not know why I left this entry.  And neither do I.  Hopefully I can just put the past behind me.  And everyone else will grow up and do the same.  You can't change the past.  This isn't the movies.  What happens, happens.  My grandmother died so suddenly, that there was no way any one could see it coming.  Or stop it.  But what you can do, is hold on to those memories.  And then move on and improve upon the future.  Because frankly my lovely readers, that's what living is.  Have a nice life."

This reminds me of a story I once heard about my great grandmother.  She always celebrated her birthday on December 21.  For sixty years or something.  But then one day she had to go overseas, and she had to obtain a passport.  It was then she realized her birthday was on December 23.  Haha, and people wonder about me... I have a lot of work to get done for today, and I'm not really too fond of holidays or my birfday.  I would discuss why, but none of us are really quite sure.  What I really have to get done today is some school work.  But of course, I probably won't finish it.  So does this mean I don't care about school?  Probably.  But how much of this silly school work will really have an effect on my life?  If you think about it that way, why any one cares about school is pretty silly.  I just have other things that I think will be more important in the long run than some pointless essay.  Like spending time with family.  Because hey, you could be dead tomorrow.  And do you honestly want to say you spent your last day away from your family and friends doing an essay?  I think not.  Okay, done with the pessimism.  I just thought I would clear some things up.

I remember seeing this one episode of Boy Meets World where the same thing happened to Cory Matthews.  Fabulous.  My favorite part in Boy Meets World ever is when Eric takes a practice SAT and receives a score of lower than 200 because he spells his name incorrectly.  ""Two T's in Matthews, stupid stupid.""  Mmmm that's hot!
I'm pretty sure the piano is my favorite instrument.  I like to listen to piano solos and shit.  It makes my mind feel all calm, and makes me ponder good moments I've had in the past.  I recommend it to everyone.  If my fingers weren't so damn big, and if my family was musically inclined at all, I think I would take lessons.  Or be ganster like Sean Burke and Mr. Cather, and totally play on my own.  But you see, my fingers are damn big.  Like the rest of me.  And I don't believe my family is really musically inclined at all.  My brother plays the guitar.  I don't know how good he is because I don't really have anyone to compare him to.  I view our general family, like cousins and shit, as more of the athletic type.  One time, my uncle led the NCAA in doubles.  My second cousin made it pretty far in the minors with the Astros.  My dad says if he played today, with the increase of teams, he would make it to the big leagues.  My dad had many athletic achievements as a young man.  I didn't really hear any of these from him though, because I guess he doesn't like to talk about himself?  Well, my mom likes to talk a lot, so I've heard them all.  Haha.  Apparently, he was tri-captain of the football team at Derby High School.  Back when they pretty much owned.  He wore the legendary number 66.  Many great players wore 66 there, and if they coach asked you to wear it, it was some big honor or something.  My dad received this at the end of his sophomore year.  I don't remember any of the honorary teams he made (like all-state and shit).  Bummer.  But in wrestling, he wrestled in the unlimited weight class at a weight of about 180.  So he basically had to wrestle kids 100 pounds more than him.  And he still finished third in the state.  He also started at third base in baseball.  Now that's hot shit.  I plan to hopefully have a successful baseball season this year, but I think I first need glasses so I can see the damn ball.  Yeah, good idea Ben.  Thaaanks.  But most of all, I want our team to be successful.  It's my senior year, and I want to go out knowing our team gave it our all.  Because chances are, this is one of the least talented teams the Wildcats will put out there in a while.  I want us to at least make it to the postseason (win 8 games).  Because then, it's like starting all over again.  Everyone starts at zero, and anyone can be a champion.  If life had a postseason, that would be kind of odd.  Oh wait, it does, and we're all going to hell.  Yayyyyyyyy.

Those were definitely golden days, and if this is all a sign of things to come, I personally cannot wait.

Like I really needed this bullshit at this time.  My heart sunk so deep, I think it was below my feet.  This is because, of course, my senior project was due today.  And I didn't exactly do it.  I can probably get through about five of the forty minutes right now.  So I was pacing around a lot when I walked through the kitchen, and I glanced at the television for some reason.  It was at this point that I thought I was hallucinating.  This was because I saw ""Seymour Public Schools - Closed"".  Then my heart came back a bit.  It was now in the bottom of my stomach.  So I watched some more, and we were in fact, closed.  Phew!  My heart then came back to where it belongs.  ....with you of course!  Haha, anywayssss, I felt like the luckiest man in the world at this point.  I then went back to bed and got 3 more hours of sleep.  Someone was totally on my side today, and for that, I would like to dedicate this entry to God, or whoever is up there.  For making magic happen in everyone's life each and every day.  Yeah, I'm usually not an advocator of religion or fate at all.  But today I was a believer.  For the time being anyways.  It's unfortunate things/people are only appreciated in times like this.  Someone needs to be thanked for today, because those roads were definitely drivable.  I'm pretty sure school was canceled because my presentation was due.  Triple <3 to snow.  And God.
Providence put me on some stupid ass waiting list.  I tore that shit up and threw it out.  If they don't want me the first time, I'm not going there.  But then Villanova and Fordham both accepted me, and they both are going to give me money.  Fordham wants to give me a lot.  You figure it out, because I sure as hell can't.  I think Providence is a little off with their decision.  Aholes.  That's all I want to share today.  Farewell.

Yeah, it's too bad I didn't even do the 1/25th that is done.  Ohhh well.  C'monnn snow.  Yeah, if we have school tomorrow, I don't know.  I'll just have to make it up off the top of my head.  And everyone except my teacher will think it's funny.  However, I've gotten 10 hours sleep in the past 4 days.  So I will not care.  I was going to say much more in this entry.  Like how fly pizza is and stuff.  However, my insides hurt again, so I'm done now.  I'm sorry."

"event","As fuckin terrible as Seymour High School baseball really is, it takes my mind off of things greatly.  It's like a whole new start to a day.  Yeah, while I'm out there dying, I don't really have too many thoughts to give to anything else that is ultimately meaningless.  I kind of like living.  So I dedicate most of my thoughts at these times to survival.  Haha, I'm kidding, it's not that bad yet.  Though I'm sure a lot of you would have quit already.  How many seniors has Kelo graduated in these 20+ years?  A little over 100?  Haha, apparently no one has anything on me if you think about this.  Yeah, I don't really want to play baseball anymore at the moment.  But I'll make it through.  We can only hope.
Yeah, I got home at 7 today.  My phone went dead so I charged that shit, and then I ate 3 meatballs.  For a piece of shit phone, it takes a really long time to charge.  As it's still charging right now.  The meatballs were virtually the only thing I had eaten all day.  I drank three Gatorades today (Two at lunch, one after practice).  That was kind of neat.  I do this to get potassium in my system, because my calves cramp up like crazy from anything.  You haven't seen a calf cramp until you see the veins in mine when I get the really big ones.  Haha, nevermind, you don't want to see that.  Oh, so the reason I started saying this was I fell asleep for about 20 minutes after eating, considering I've gotten 8 hours sleep in the last three days.  It was fabulous.  Except when I woke up.  My left leg cramped up entirely, from the calf to the quad.  I seriously thought I was poisoned/dying.  But then my EMT father came over and fixed it <3.  So in conclusion, baseball sucks, and is not a priority of mine anymore.  Neither is that senior project.  Haven't started yet; it's due Thursday (40 minute presentation).  Can someone do it for me?  I'll give you all the money I have.  Which is four dollars.  Just kidding!  Oh man, I got you guys good.  Okay, I'm ending this suck-ass paragraph now.
When I was a young lad, a boy of about 9 or 10, I liked Slim Jims a lot.  Everytime my mother would go to the grocery store, I would ask her to get me one.  And I believe everytime except for one, she did.  I remember one time that she didn't, they ran out or something.  I had my doubts at the time that that was the real case, but I think I'll just believe her now.  So anyways, point of the story.  I came home today, and on the computer desk where I spend my majority of the time, there's a super long Slim Jim with a note.  I'll just share this note with all of you now.  ""Thought maybe this would help you make it through the rest of the week.  Mom :-)""  Aw, that was like one of the best things ever.  Especially for a time like this.  So in conclusion, I dedicate this entry to my parents, who support me in whatever I do, no matter what it is.  Or what I should have done.  Pretty much no matter who I am, they'll support me.  And I love them much for it.  Always and forever <3"

"event","Look, I'm tired about reading all these indirect references towards myself.  You can just say my name instead.  Or leave me a really neat comment here.  I'm not intimidated by any of you.  And I don't really care what you think.  You can't change the past, and not many people see anything wrong with what originally transpired.  What's going down now... we was kind of led right to it.  Maybe everyone should think about that one for a while.  As for me, I'm done with this bullshit.  I can't dwell on it any longer, because there's nothing to do about it now.  So once again, you fags can say what you want about me.  I won't mind.  I've punished myself psychologically far worse than any of your words will ever accomplish.

"event","Sorry for the very depressing pissed off journal last night.  I was in a very bad mood.  I'm a lot better now actually.  It looks like sleep did me good.  I'm just all confused about a lot of stuff right now.  Oh well...I'm still a teenager, its ok for me to be confused about stuff, haha!  Although in less then a month it will be unacceptable!!! because I will be 20.  Not that, that changes anything at all...I still can't do pretty much anything in Baltimore.  Ya know, I wish I was 21 just for the reason that I could actually go out places with people, like my brother, or my older friends.  I'd just like to be able to go hang out in a bar or something.  I mean, I don't have any problem whatsoever getting alcohol when I want it, so obviously its not the drinkin thing that bothers me...its the not being able to go anywhere.  Its kinda funny cuz when I turned 18 I was all excited becuase ya know, that meant I could go to clubs and stuff and hang out but even thats gotten to the point where almost every night of the week you have to be 21 to get in anywhere unless its college night and then all the dumbasses come out but you only have to be 18.  Oh well...I guess its really not that big of a deal.  I only have about a year left and after that I will be able to do whatever I want and go wherever I want FOREVER! haha.  And I still have fun hanging out at home...most of the time...ok, well I'm going to stop talking about that.  I think all my friends agree with me on this subject.  Ya know, I'm starting to really enjoy using livejournal and my myspace blog.  It's kinda nice to be able to vent...even though it is through a computer. Alright, well I'm sick of the computer now.."

"event","So its been about a week since my last update...not too bad.  I'm at work right now with nothing to do so I figured, HEY why dont you write some shit in your livejournal!  So in the past few weeks I've been having a really awesome time at school, and actually doing my work and getting good grades, YAY FOR ME!  I joined this Hip Hop group on campus like 2 weeks ago and I absolutely love it.  I have always wanted to learn how to dance hip hop but I've never had the opportunity, but then my friend Peter from work told me about this group he was in so I decided to try it out.  SO MUCH FUN.  Most of the people in it can dance really well to so its kinda nice to watch all those guys dance, pretty sexy.  My regular dance classes tho, they've kind of been kicking my ass cuz this week we had guest instructors all week and they were teaching us some pretty hard stuff.  Monday and Friday (Today) we had two different ladies come teach modern.  The lady on monday was really crazy and fun.  That was actually a pretty fun class.  Today I didn't have as much fun tho.  The lady wasn't as crazy and I was really tired because for some reason I didn't sleep at all last night.  I couldn't fall asleep and when I did I would wake up like 15 minutes later.  It was really annoying.  But anyways, on wed. we had our regular modern teacher but he decided to make it a yoga class...and let me tell you, yoga is freakin hard!!!  I stretched things I didn't know existed!  We also had a guest teacher for my ballet class on thursday but I didn't go cuz i accidentally slept through my alarm because I had gone out the night before.  So thats about it for this week.  OH, last saturday I went to a wedding for a friend I graduated high school with.  I wasn't sure about going at first but I am really glad that I did.  She was really glad to see me and I was really glad to see her and stuff.  I gave her my contact info so hopefully I'll hear from her when she gets back from her honeymoon.  Getting to see her and rekindle our friendship and stuff has made me really want to start talking to people who I went to high school with and who I was friends with.  Its just always kind of weird to do that at this point since its been over 2 years and stuff.  Oh well, it can't hurt to try.  I talked to 2 guys who I was really good friends with in high school the past few days and that made me really happy.  They seemed to like hearing from me.  So I think I'm gonna try and keep in touch with these people now, they were always a lot of fun.  But anyways, thats all for now, my hands are getting tired of typing, hehe.  And to some of you who read this, don't forget about tomorrow night or I'll chop off your big toe.  TOOTLES!"

"event","Ok, so I havn't updated in a few months so I figured I should probably update if I'm going to continue to have a livejournal account.  So I guess I'll start by talking about my summer.
  So as school ended last semester I ended up having to go home early because I got really sick and had to go see a specialist.  That was a wonderful ending to the semester.  But I did get fun drugs from the doctor so those kept me entertained for a couple of days, heh.  Once I was better I started working at a restaurant in Frederick called Hard Times Cafe and Cue.  I actually enjoyed my job there.  A lot of people who worked there didn't like it at all but I had a lot of fun.  I think it had to do with the fact that I really liked most of the people I worked with and actually became really good friends with a couple of them.  Oh and while I was working there I was also taking a class at UMBC for the first part of the summer.  It was Biology 100 Lab so it was pretty easy.  While I was taking that class and working I also moved into my apartment with Joan and Teresa.  That was exciting.  We had a painting party about a week after we moved in.  That was a lot of fun too, we got all our friends together and had them help us paint our apartment!  Around that time I ended up having a mental break down as well.  That was NOT FUN.  I seriously thought I was going crazy or something.  But I'm all better now.  Let me tell you all right now, therapy works :)  Oh, and the kid that I was kinda ""dating""...yea we broke up.  Its all good though, I'm completely over that.  The whole situation right now just seems a bit childish so I'm just trying to avoid it.  Anyways, thats all in the past.  SO...The rest of my summer after class ended was pretty good.  I got to hang out with my brother and his friends alot.  They are all really cool and fun to be around.  OOOH, I forgot, sometime during the summer, I don't remember what day, Joan, Savanna, Alison, Fanny, and I went to Sandy Point.  It's this little beach by the bay.  It was really fun.  We were there for like 4 or 5 hours and I got burnt to a crisp even though I put on sun screen multiple times.  I seriously was having trouble walking for a few days cuz I was burned all over my body...It was terrible.  While we were there, there was a little girl who was floating around in her little inner tube holding a dead fish.  It was the most disgusting thing I have ever seen.  I honestly wanted to be sick or something, cuz the fish had goo hanging out of its mouth too.  OH, and the little girls mother was standing right next to her and wasn't doing anything!  I was like, whats wrong with you woman!  But yea....So that was fun.  So yea the summer progressed, same ol same ol.  The last week in July I got to house sit this ENORMOUS house.  It was awesome.  They are really cool people.  My brother came over a few times with me and we hung out there.  The week right after that I went to Panama with a group from my church.  We ran a Medical clinic, and some of the team members did construction down in this area of Panama called Arenosa.  I worked in the medical clinic though.  I was doing blood pressures and weights of all the people who came through the clinic.    It was an amazing experience.  I met so many awesome people, who I am keeping in touch with, from the team and down in Panama.  It was also the hardest thing I've ever done too.  First of all, I had to get on the plane, and that was hard enough for me since I absolutely HATE flying.  And to add onto that our flight schedule was all messed up going down there because something was wrong with the plane that we were supposed to fly down there in so it was delayed and all this other shit happened.  It was nuts, I'll try and make this short, but basically we were supposed to fly to Atlanta on a tuesday and then fly to Panama.  What we ended up doing was flying to Miami, spending the night in a hotel, for about 3 hours (if you would call that spending the night) and then half of the team had to fly to Panama at 7 am and the rest of us went at 11 am.  It was such a hastle but it made the whole experience even better.  But I was able to make it through that.  While we were down there we got about 6 hours of sleep every night and worked for over 12 hours a day.  Of course there was no air conditioning, in door plumbing, you couldn't drink the water, etc.  So for a bunch of spoiled American's it was like hell down there.  For the people who live down there though, its their was of life, of course.  But no matter how hard it was down there it was still one of the best experiences of my life and I am totally going back next year.  I have lots of pictures so if anyone wants to see them I will be more then happy to show you all.  So after we got back from Panama the last couple of weeks of my summer were pretty calm.  Worked a few days, but mainly just got all my stuff ready to go back to school.  Liz's 21st birthday was a few days after I got back so we all celebrated that too.  OH MY GOSH!! I totally forgot to mention this but I also got a cat during the summer.  He's sooo cute and his name is Mr. Sam and I love him.  
  So anyways....I came back to school August 23rd (right after I had a plastic surgeon cut up my back) for training cuz I work at the HSD front desk, but anyone who is reading this probably already knows that.  School started about a week after that and since then I've just been doin the usual..ya know, classes, homework, studyin, workin, and the occasionaly party.  We havn't really had a big party at our apartment yet though.  I really want to have one though soon.  I've been to a few good ones though recently.  This past weekend was Amanda's 21st Birthday Party and that was a lot of fun, and the day after that Rob had a party and that was also a blast.  There were other random parties in there but I can't really remember them.  OOOH, we did have a little dinner party at our apartment a few friday's ago which was a lot of fun.  Feng cooked us dinner and Pullak and Kurt assisted.  It was really good too.  We all dressed up and ate together and talked and had wine.  It was a blast.  I want to do that again sometime.  So I think thats about it.  I did have my first test today.  That went alright, it was a bit harder then I expected but I did pretty well considering I didn't study all that much.  I ended up getting a migraine last night and went to bed instead of studying.  
  One more thing, its kinda weird but since I've moved off campus, I feel like I've gotten more involved then when I live on campus.  I still have my desk job, but now I'm trying to get involved with the Dance Council of Majors/Minors, I'm doing frisbee again, I'm learning how to dance Hip Hop-I joined the hip hop club or whatever its called, and I'm spending more time around campus rather then in my room all the time.  I've also been running alot but thats not getting involved thats getting in shape :)  Over all though, I feel like this is going to be a good year and I am really excited about it.  The beginning of the semester was kinda hard getting setteled and everything but now everything is awesome.  
  Whew!  That was a loooooooooooong entry and anyone who see's this better read the whole thing or else!  Cuz it took me almost 45 minutes to write this. hahaha....alright BITCHES, hopefully I will be better with this so I can keep you all updated on whats going on in my life because I know you all are dying to know and your lives revolve around me.  Peace!"

"event","Ok, so seriously, the only time I ever update this thing is when I'm working.  I guess it is really the only time I have to waste doing this.  Well, to start I think I am doing better in school.  I have gotten a couple of grades back and they have been A's!  That made me happy:)  I'm not sure if I ever mentioned this but my parents got a BMW which is also exciting.  My dad bought it for my mom for their anniversary.  I have a feeling I mentioned that in a previous entry tho but oh well.  I am pretty happy that school is going to be out soon.  I have had enough of this year.  It hasn't been too bad just pretty stressful.  And I also can't wait to get my apartment.  Thats going to be fucking awesome.  One thing I really hate about this shift is that I have to change the tape and I can never remember which tape to put in.  So I end up asking everyone if they know.  I'm not a very good desk staffer...HAHA JK!  I'm awesome.  This saturday is my brothers birthday and I dont know what to get him.  He is turning 23 this year, if anyone has a suggestions on what to get him I would be ever so thankful because I have NO IDEA.  I mean, he likes music and movies and everything but he already has alike all the cds and dvds that he wants right now so the only thing I can think of to get him is alcohol but I dont think my parents would really appreciate me giving him alcohol....actually....I dont know if they would mind all that much but that just seems like such a thoughtless gift.  I mean, yea I spent money and everything but I didn't really spend much time or effort thinking about it ya know?  Ok, I am supremely bored right now, but I should really start studying because I think I have an exam tomorrow.  Lata"

"event","Once again, its 7 in the morning and I'm working at the front desk and really fuckin bored so I'm updating.  I can't wait till this shift is over.  I am going right back to sleep...too bad I have to wake up at 1 30 in the afternoon to go to class, but oh well.  I didn't really get much sleep last night because I went to bed really late, and then woke up at around 6 to come to work.  So these past few days have been, well I guess you could say exciting.  So much drama, I'm not used to it like I used to be when Jeff and I were dating, haha, that sounds so bad.  I mean, things were good between us but ya know, we did argue alot.  Moving on though, I decided the other day that I wanted to start dating again, I mean, I have been single for 10 months now.  But there are just so many things that kinda scare me about starting to date people again.  First of all, I have a feeling that some people I am interested in or just purely like to spend time with may think I like them so that kind of makes me feel weird.  I mean, If someone is showing no intrest back in me or anything like that then I'm not going to pursue anything.  And I have kind of been changing my mind alot about people so I dont want someone to find out that I may be interested and then change my mind.  Even if they dont like me back its still kinda weird.  Plus I'm just too much of a pussy, hahahah.  I mean, honestly, I'm not saying that I'm scared to start anything with someone because I may get hurt.  I'm scared to start anything with someone because I'm scared of hurting them.  So I think what I really want right now is to ""date"" people but not really.  I mean, its not like I'm looking for anything serious, I just kinda miss being able to..I dont know, its hard to explain.  But anyways...I'm going to stop talking about that now before I sounds like a sad, desperate, lonely girl, hahaha.  So monday I definately failed a stat exam but oh well.  I suck in that class.  No matter how much I go to that class and how much I do the homework I always manage to fuck up royaly on her quizzes and exams.  On the other hand, I was in this beauty pagent for charity last night and it was pretty fun.  I actually got 2nd runner up which was really fuckin suprising considering I basically didn't care at the end about how I was answering the questions and completely fucked it up.  Man, I have nothing else to write, and I have to e-mail my professor now."

"event","So once again, I am sitting here at the front desk working at 7 in the morning.  This seems to be time that I'm really update my live journal.  Well lets see, whats been going on in my life...well first of all, last night I drove to New Jersey with Rob, Savanna, and Julien to go to white castle, and I must say, I was extremely dissapointed.  I was expecting an orgasm in my mouth from what I was being told by people, however it was quite the opposite.  I mean, they wern't completely revolting but they were pretty bad.  Anyways, after we ate, by the way rob ate 10 of those burgers..it was pretty funny, we found a random neighborhood with not that many street lights around and laid out some towels I had in my car on the ground and looked at the stars for a while.  That was pretty cool, I saw a few shooting stars and we were trying to figure out all the constelations.  After about 15-20 minutes though we were all pretty fuckin cold so we headed back to UMBC.  On the way TO white castle I did get a pretty funny call from Jeff.  Right after I said hello I knew he was drunk.  Apparently he was on the beach alone, drunk, and had locked his keys in his car and none of his friends could come get him.  Seriously though, sometimes guys really piss me off.  They ask/say certain things, where either way you answer or respond it just sucks big time.  I dont really feel like going into that right now though so if anyone is curious you can just ask me or something.  So anyways, when we got back from our little road trip I just hung out with alison for a little while till about 6 when I had to come to work and now we are watching anchorman in the lobby.  At 9 when I get off work we are going to go to Panara to get food and visit Teresa.  Well...I dont really have anything left to say, except for the fact that I think I need to go on a date in the near future because I havn't been on one in a long time so you all need to help me out here ;)  HOLLA!"

I'm glad I get off in like 15 minutes but I'm only gonna be able to get 3 hours of sleep because of stupid staff development.  Ahh well...I went to sonar again tonight.  It was fun, but I had a lot more fun last week.  I was DD tonight so that may have had something to do with it.  I mean, I'm not saying that I can't have fun sober but truthfully, its a bit more fun to go to clubs after drinking because it kind of helps me loosen up a bit so when I'm dancing I dont feel like a complete idiot.  Ahh well, next time:)  So today, even tho I have that stupid staff development stuff, shouldn't be too bad.  I'm gonna sleep for a while after 12 and then watch sex and the city with liz, and then work, and then hopefully party a little bit.  I'm gonna save my work this weekend for sunday, which is what I usually do but oh well.  I think I want to change my live journal picture...the one that I have is getting old, I'm sick of looking at it, hah!  OHH GOD, Pullak just opened a thing of fish food and it smells like complete shit!  But anywayz...Sonar was pretty funny tonight, there are some crazy people who go there who just go nuts when dancing.  ahahahahahaha, it makes me laugh.  So I've recently become obsesed with this song by Bob Marley called ""Red Red Wine"".  Its so chill, I love it.  So I'm wondering what I'm going to do for spring break.  I hope we go back to the beach again, I had so much fun last year when we went.  It was fuckin crazy:)  Well I'm getting off work in 5 minutes so I think its time to end this now.  Peace out ya'll:p"

"event","So I definately just want to drop out of school now.  I swear, I dont know why I'm a bio major.  I mean, yea I like most of the shit in it and everything, but I'M NOT ANY GOOD AT IT!  Its crazy how you can like something so much, yet suck at it so much at the same time.  I dont understand, but now I'm at work and I've spent the last hour trying to figure out this stupid stat project, which happens to be due today and I didn't get the website where the information was till this morning, and I can't fucking figure it out so I have to go have my TA explain it to me and then pray to god that he gives me more time because I explained to him in an e-mail how much of an idiot I am.  OOh yes, and I wasn't able to sleep last night so I've been up all night and I wont be able to go to sleep till 8:30 tonight.  Now I admit that the whole staying up all night was somewhat my own doing, but I knew i wouldn't be able to go to sleep until like 3 or 4 and by then there would be no point because I would have to get up at 5 30 and when I go to sleep that late and have to wake up that early...well i just dont wake up.  ARG, I really just want to scream.  I mean, I REALLY want to do well this semester because so far my grades in college have been less then steller and I just want to prove to myself and my parents that I'm not a fucking dead beat idiot whos going to fail out of college.  I think I need to be on some medicine to make me focus.  I have a hard time focusing.  Thats terrible of me to say ""i need to be on some medicine"" i mean, i'm sure i dont need to be, but it would help alot.  ok, So now I'm arguing with myself about whether all that medicine shit should really be given out to ppl like me.  Wow...its way to early, and i havn't gotten any sleep, and i think i'm losing my mind.  I really need a vacation...like now..I dont think I have ever written so much on my live journal before.  Maybe I should only write when I'm really stressed out and tired.  I'm sure it makes for more interesting posts.  Oh, and on top of that! I'm attempting to quit smoking for the 50th time..but this time I will be successful because I can't keep doing this whole yes i'm quitting..oh just one more bullshit.  Plus, I have some motivation...I made a bet with a few ppl that I can quit by the end of march, and if i do, they will each give me $20.  So thats basically whats going on in my life right now...pretty depressing right?  Oh, one last piece of information...right now my hair is hanging across my eyes and the sun is shinning on it and it looks orange..it looks kinda cool..thats why i decided to write that.. ok thats it!  I'm done!  No more posting because you all are going to think that I have officially lost it!  Unless you already have."

Since I have nothing interesting going on in my life I'm just gonna start makin shit up.  So last night was crazy insane.  I got really drunk and then started doing all these drugs..shit man, I was droppin acid and rollin, it was sick!.........yea i'm not a good liar...I am excited because i'm going to a 5 year olds birthday party on friday!  Yea, thats the most excitement I have in my life.  Another thing is jeff comes back on sunday.  That should be interesting.  I'm not quite sure how to feel about that.  If anyone who know's my history with him would like to give me advice I'm would be more then gracious because I dont know what I'm going to do.  I mean, I'm sure I'm going to see him and everything....*sigh* I just dont know.  Oh, and my parents told me that they are going back to hawaii in april to look at property.  My parents are a bit crazy.  They are always talkin about doing things but never do them so when they said ""yea we're gonna buy property in hawaii"" i thought they were just being their usual selves, but no.  Dont get me wrong, I'm all for it and everything, I mean that would be so fucking tight to have a condo in hawaii its just kinda crazy to think about....Welp...bout that time for me to be hittin the old dusty trail.

I have funny pictures of it too so if anyone wants to see just tell me and I'd be more then happy to show you.  I also spent a good amount of time in the hospital tonight because my friend broke his nose.  It wasn't all that bad though.

All of my friends from home have got their own lives now since they are all going to different schools...So I'm thinking I'm just gonna go move to oregon where my brother is.  I could start a whole new life there and that would just be awesome.  Oregon is such a chill place.  Yea, I think thats what I'm going to do.  Yea, ok I'm moving...there is absolutly nothing here worth staying for.  I can go to college somewhere else and be just as happy and get just as good of an education.  I already called my brother in Oregon and asked if I could stay with him over winter break.  That would be so completely awesome..and while I'm there I can think about things and decide what I really want to do.  It would give me a break from all the bullshit here.  And I really dont want to go home tomorrow.  I mean, its not like I hate my family or anything I just dont feel like driving home to go vote.  I mean, I dont even know who I'm going to vote for.  I didn't pay attention to what any of the candadites stood for so I know nothing about them.  All I know is that everyone hates bush and I dont even know why.  But whatever.

"event","So I'm fairly proud of myself right now.  Not only did I quite smoking, but I also have not smoked pot in a long time, and I plan on keeping it that way, and I would not consider myself a huge partier anymore.  First of all, the reason i quite smoking ciggerettes...well that's fairly obvious, its just not a good habit.  And the whole pot thing, well I just lost intrest and I figured it wasn't worth the risk.  And finally, as for the partying/drinking..yea that can still be fun EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.  Its funny to see the same kids on my floor, in fact on every floor really, drunk all the time and i think, wow, that was me last year, HAHAHAHA.  But those days are over for me, and I really hope that these kids learn as well or they will be like a few people I know and not going to school anymore.  So yea, thats my story

By the way, I'm not saying that people who do do what I have just mentioned are going straight to hell or anything, just some of those activities were not for me:) I love you all!"

Ok, so anyways, yesterday was Joan's birthday so teresa and i went out and got a cake, rose, and card for her.  Then we kind of suprised her with it after forcing her to come over to patapsco to get it.  Yea, i think when she heard how eager we were to have her come over it may have given away that we had something planned.  So last night after we celebrated Joan's birthday and everything I went out and played touch football with a bunch of people.  That was sooo much fun!  I'm trying to get better at it because I am going to be playing on the powderpuff team for patapsco. WOOOO!  So the rest of this week should be pretty chill.

All the guys in the frat were like ""EVERYBODY GET OUT!!!!"" and at that point i had no idea where anybody i knew was.  Finally i found them and we ended up climbing over this fence where i got tangled in some vines.  At that time i was pretty pissed but now that i look back, it was pretty funny (laughing to myself).

There were so many cool people there.  I knew most of them but the ones I didn't were all very friendly.  This one guy there was kinda creepy though and kept trying to massage me and everyone else and it was kinda freakin me out.  But anyways...he ended up passing out so that was good.  I didn't buy anything at this time cause I didn't have any money:(  I'll make up for it at the next party though.  Saturday night I worked so that kind of sucked but Asia and Pullak sat at the desk and kept me company and it was a lot of fun.  We completely raided the snack machine and then Asia and I kept joking around behind the desk and it was really funny.

We went to 2 frat parties because the back yards were right next to each other so when one keg ran out we just went to the other one.  My friend was trying to get me to show my nipple ring so we could get free cups but i told her that only privileged people could see it.haha.  Oh yea, and while we were waiting for the bus to go back to the dorms we saw a bunch of kids from UMBC who actually live on our floor.  It was pretty funny.  So anyways...Working at the desk has been pretty cool.  It gives me a chance to do my homework and i have met lots of people.  I never have anything to write about in my live journal:(  My life really needs to be more exciting.  Maybe i'll go sell myself on the street or start doing lots of drugs.

"event","Ok, so its sunday and i still have 3 finals left.  I hate finals.  But i did get to see Jeff this weekend!  I'm so happy i got to see him.  He's going back to school today though :(  I think i'm going to take a road trip up to Mass. to see him if anyone wants to come!  I hate that he goes to school so far away but whatever.  Summer is going to be great, i can't wait!  I dont know what else to write.  I'm just so tired right now *sigh*.  Ok well i think i'm gonna go study now and i'll write more a little bit later."

"event","OK so tonight was AWESOME!  I went to the drag show with kate and teresa and ended up seeing kristin there too.  Elliot did his african dance which was great and a lot of my other friends did some really funny songs.  It was so funny.  We actually saw a profession drag queen there too.  He (I guess you would say) was so great.  He did this dance and was doin back flips and everything in it too.  It was great.  But anyways, yea I really wanted to get some school work done today but just ended up doing nothing and i feel like i wasted the day but oh well.  I can't wait till the year is over.  I just want it to be summer so my friends and i can hang out and i can see my baby :)  For some reason i was in such a good mood today, which of course isn't a bad thing because i havn't really been in a while.  I'm pretty tired so i think i'm goin to bed now.  I have actually been getting to bed at a decent hour recently so thats good.  Wow..i just realized that this entry is not interesting at all.  I need to write better stuff in the future haha.  Alright well goodnight all!"

"event","Ok, so I'm not really used to having a live journal so thats why i havn't really written in it for a while...so quite a bit has happened.  My parents went to Hawaii for 2 weeks and got back this past friday.  OMG my dad gave my mom this ring for their anniversary, it was soooooooo pretty.  They brought us back a lot of cool stuff too.  Like, they got me a shirt, braclet, like 3 necklaces, this wrap thing and a dashboard hoola dancer!  They said they had a really good time.  Oh yea, they are also saying they are going to buy a convertible now cause they were driving one while they were there and they liked it so much that i think they are gonna get one.  Well anyways, this past weekend has been kind of rough for me.  Jeff and I were not getting along at all and I thought it was the end of us.  Luckily we talked about it and decided we needed to fix some things and now we are back together:)  For those who didn't know we had been broken up for about a month and had plans to get back together but as I said I thought that wasn't going to happen after this weekend.  But I was wrong!  I'm so happy now.  I miss him so much though.  I think at the end of may I am going to go up and visit him so I'm excited about that!  So I'm very happy for my friend Steph.  She was elected to be station manager at my school radio station.  GO STEPH!!!  So I havn't really been doing anything recently so I think I'm gonna hang out with some friends tonight.  That should be fun, I'm excited:)  OH YEA, I forgot, I got a job at the desk for next year! WOOOO, I'm very happy.  And I think I'm actually going to be living on campus rather then getting an off campus apartment.  I think its just going to be too much right now to try and do that so I think I'm going to be living on 2nd north.  Alright, well thats all for right now.  I'll try and keep this updated better in the future."

"event","Yea so I just finished studying with amanda and mark.  It was pretty fun, colles was there for a while.  I think I got an ok amount of studying done for tonight...or this morning, however you want to look at it.  I need to make this more interesting but I guess I'm just not an interesting person.  Ah well...So this weekend should be fun.  My parents are going to Hawaii on saturday for 2 weeks so saturday morning I'm probably gettin drunk with some friends and then sunday I'm having dinner at kristin's house.  Oh yea and tonight I might be going to Bootleggers again!  Wohoo!  Last time was so much fun with teresa and alyssa, and I think this time it might be the three of us and then kristin may come too.  YAY!  Friday I have a test in chem which I CANNOT fail or I'm fucked.  I hope my next entries are more interesting then this one.  Well I think I'll go to bed now.  This will be the earliest I've gone to bed in a couple of weeks. HAHA.  Alright, well goodnight everyone!"

Friends have moved away.
Oldest brother attempted suicide on Mothers day....and again on Father's day...
..hes out of the hospital now...
Oldest sister is an alcoholic and starting to pick up on her old drug addictions

I don't know anyone anymore...Everything and Everyone I once knew so well, has altered. I can only make it through the day if I live in my memories of things.

There is nothing here for us.

Adam and I are moving to Italy. Kristi is helping us set things up


I don't even think anyone will notice our disappearance honestly.

Hell, I don't even know why I bother writing in this thing. Throwing words into the wind.

ah well.

until we meet again"

your drawing even more
Too late to see
too late to be

Out beyond the farthest star...
even there the reminder of
a place once cherished

Hidden far away
From the bustling crowd,
meaningless conversation,
and hollow laughter...

A secret place in these woods...
Only children's hearts can find it.
And that we did.

Find me friend. I am waiting.
Like the steadfast Oak
I will wait forever."

Its always happened that way. Its like crap and crap and crap keeps happening, and then the final blow hits and then I am struck with this hope that keeps me striving, a whole new outlook.<br />I like to think its my mother, sending me her strength, whispering that everything will be okay.<br /><br />As the current living situation goes, i am staying with my sister. they ask only 25 bucks a week and that i be home every day to babysit.<br />Easy task i know, but i usually hangout and end up literally falling asleep watching the daily show. my phone alarm didnt wake me up last night.<br />It was one slip too many, so my sister has given me till july to move. which is generous of her. The thing is,however, I am not extremely uneasy, and dont even want to go home.&nbsp;<br /><br />Course this new no home problem is added to omega stress from work and a mild depression i have been battling for half my life.<br />For some reason I have just been feeling utterly alone for the past few months. Last week&nbsp;i was in such a mood to heavily wish death upon myself...not suicide, but...almost a divine intervention....of death. I&nbsp;think if i do die young i want to be in the forest near my old house in cranston...its where i found the most peace.&nbsp;I miss my mother terribly and I just wish that she was here to take care of me.<br /><br />But shes not. So Im frickin doing it on my own. Sure things suck a bit at times, but that doesnt mean they cant get better.<br />I found a place for rent. cheap,quirky, and ugly. And yet I am oddly attracked to it.&nbsp;I find a offbeat since of charm to the place...god only knows why.<br />I have to give them a call back on Friday ::crosses fingers:: hopefully everything goes well :)<br /><br />but anyway, thats the update...its kind of weird...i dunno, thats how my brain was flowing</p>"

A thousand stories to be told. (speaking of, has anyone seen The Story Teller? a Show by Jim Henson, highly recommended)

Friends come and go. Find love, Loose Love, Fall down, Pick self up. Oy.

Just been in a kind of isolation, doing some reflecting, sorry if caused any worry. I love you Nate, you know this. Just telling you again. No one will ever understand us. Hahaha, let 'em try.&nbsp;

My friends..I tell stories about you. It keeps you there with me through my day. I'm here for you always. You want to talk, or hangout. I'm here for you, always have been always will be.
I've stayed away because I needed time to think about my life. Thinking about the past and present. and ever hopeful future.

I've tried dating...I can't do it. I can't be with someone when part of my heart belongs to someone else.&nbsp; time for me.

Watched the rest of Firefly...I love that show...Now just need to buy Serenity.

haha, Matt and I watched David the Gnome. That brought me waaaay back. I love gnome kisses.

Went to Vermont for the wedding. simply wonderful. i love my family so much. they had a frickin secondary mario cake. love love love. video games were played,toast was eaten, and there was dancing. I liked my dress.

I love the older ladies at work, they're my friends and they take care of me...it's so cute.&nbsp;

I'd like to go ice skating. That would be so nice."

"event","When My younger sister Anastasia was 3 and a half she began playing Zelda games with my Dad.
She would sit on his lap and help him with puzzles. She'd remember more then he did. She started opening up treasure chests and playing on her own.
One thing held her back. Reading. Thats right, so my little FUCKING AMAZING sister began to learn to read for no other reason then to play Zelda.
She also began to count rupies.Now She has gone through all the Zelda games and is currently playing twighlight princess on gamecube.

why game cube? why not the wii?

Because Link is FUCKING left handed. yeah, because the majority of people are right handed so they had to flip the game.

Emma is starting to play zelda now too...she opens the treasure chests....but shes starting to get fusterated because she cant read.

I love my little sisters.

"event","Okay Ashley, Here is a Live Journal post, all for you.

First of all Adam doesnt have to ""hack"" into my LJ, he has his own.

But moving on...

Adam is the most kind hearted boy ever. I don't know where you are getting this ""He treats me like crap"" from.
When he was dating you he came to me depressed, wondering why you were calling him namaes, making him feel like he was worthless.
Thats why we drifted apart. How can I be close to someone that is hurting my brother...I didnt know what to say to you.

He says he isnt ignoring you... He says that he just needs space from you because you two fight. So why don't you just give him the frickin space? I'm sick of hearing him complain that you're annoying him.

Adam claims that he tried to make the relationship work..and this I know...because He first came to me bothered by your negative attitude towards him in march....and you guys lasted awhile after that.

He isnt just taking up some 14 year old either. You obviously must know that there are plenty of girls that would like to go out with Adam, he just happens to have a good amount in common with her. He took a long while and debated over whether or not he should even date her...

ask anyone their opinion of adam...they will say he is a nice, talented kid. Hes friendly and out going.

you are the only person i have ever known to say that he is a jerk.

so sorry if i dont sympathize with you, but i am really frickin tired of you trash mouthing my brother."

"event","My family is very religious.
My father is an assistant pastor, my uncle a pastor...
my whole family believes in God.
everyone was brought up in to know and love God.


I know that I would never be able to spend the rest of my life w/someone who doesn't have the same morals and some belief in God.
It's a chunk of a relationship.

How can you date someone who doesn't believe in something that you truely believe in? How could someone who doesnt believe in God stay with someone whose whole life has been brought up/ involves religion?

It would work for a little while but it would eventually crumble.

That's just how it is. And I know that the majority of my family is that way.

Everyone of my siblings have a significant other who is either very religeous or has some belief/faith in G-d.....


It takes a little more then liking the same music or television shows."

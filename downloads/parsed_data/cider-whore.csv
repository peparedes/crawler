got a letter from danny in bootcamp. he really likes it so that's cool. its kinda beat tho that he left his house to a bunch of morons. i can just imagine how it must look in there, knowing that he just refinished the upstairs. and god knows how the dog is doing. those dumb kids would draw on him with markers when dan was around so i can only imagine what they do to him now. and id take the dog but we're not allowed pets here. and you know what really blows my mind is that the kids that dan gae a place to stay for a cheap price who say they are his friends wont even write to him. they better wise the fuck up and stop dicking around, cause one of these days im gonna roll by there and its not gonna be pretty."

saturday started off real shitty. we went to hoboken to catch the PATH train to the city. only problem is the parking lot where john used to park you now have to pay, so we drove around a bit lookin for a place to park, didnt happen. ended up payin $20 to park all day. we got into the city and were meeting up with his cousin. his cousin got so lost, i dont know why. i guess he couldnt figure out where we wer emeeting up. anyways...we finally meet up with him. check out a few shops. then he has us walk all over the west village, then walk to the east village to go to some bar. beers were $5 a bottle. so we didnt stay long. we headed home around 9. so i guess all in all it wasnt too bad. we never made it to the wretched ones show, but its all good."

its cool that there are more and more decent shows coming around, it just figures they come to town when i leave. driving 5 hours to philly is getting a bit old. the drive isnt a bad one, its just sitting in a car for 5 hours really sucks. 

well, this weekend should be fun so its worth it. i havent been to the city in a long time. we're gonna hit a few bars with johns cousin from long island. then we're gonna go to new brunswick. im excited, the wretched ones should be a good show. jersey shows are much better than philly ones. no drama, and its 21+ which is even better."

we did manage to meet one cool kid and we all went to some irish pub. they had yuengling in bottles as well as cider so that place ruled. we sat there til last call then went to dinosaur bbq. that place was rad. i got a pork cheesesteak thing with 2 sides of tators. john was drunk and spilled soda all voer me, but i didnt care, i was hungry as fuck."

anyways....i feel like i live amongst a zoo. last night john almost got sprayed by a skunk. last week 4 huge racoons came up to the porch, if you look across the street there are like 30 cows grazing and once in a while you'll see deer. john also said there are bears up here too, im real excited about running into a friggin bear. but all in all its really nice up here. people are so goddamn nice. it really is disturbing. 

syracuse is about an hour away and dave hillyard is playing there soon as are the toasters so im kinda excited about that. i havent been to a ska show in years, philly hasnt had many ska shows in the past few years. atleast i dont have to worry about tough guy hardcore kids punching me in the face, my scar is still very noticable :("

"event","my tummy hurts bad. im not exactly sure why. maybe i shouldnt drink as much as i have been. but philly sucks and theres really nothing else to do but drink. the scene here is dead for obvious reasons. only decent shows coming up are 21+ which is good because im sick to death of the bullshit that goes on at shows anymore. im glad that we can go to shows in jersey and not have to deal with the crap that is brewing in philly. i cant understand why people cant just keep their noses out of other peoples business. if you dont like it here, get the fuck out :)"

"event","..and i finally do an update LOL

PG is going well. Pushing 23 weeks now (well 22w6d) and feeling ok. Baby is intent on laying transverse majority of the time which can prove uncomfortable but he is kicking and thrashing about in there so that's all that matters :) Am needing to get a little more motivation and start getting baby items organised though ;)
 

Sam has settled into new school well. Back to school Monday for last term. I can't believe we are in the final stages of his first year at school, it just goes so fast :(

Layney is all excited about starting her Prep orientation. She had her final round of needles before school (what a drama) and is pesterng me as to when she can go to school LOL

Not sure how hayden will go being only one at home, but baby should be here by the time school starts next yr (hopefully) so he won't be alone for long lol

Weather is starting to warm up here, which in turn is bringing out the snakes. MIL dog was bitten the other night while we were visiting. $1200 later dog is ok but offending snake is yet to be caught :( Am keeping lawns low and paddock slashed so even though they will be around, i will be able to see them coming, well i hope so. 

We have a new addition arriving Monday, a horse for Adam :) very excited, and although he is rather big (17h) i can't wait to have him around :)

Speaking of Adam, he started a new job today. Endless miles on the highway and have worn him down so he switching over to local for a while. He will be home on weekends and every night, this will take some getting used to LOL!!!

All in all, life is good :)"

After a fair while away i have decided to come back and start a journal again :) Much has been happening here and i would like to get it all down in one spot rather fill everyone in as i go :)

Hi to anyone who remembers me, and i hope you are all doing well!

I will be back later to make a decent post after kids are fed, settled and i have had a fiddle with the rather dodgy looking settings here :p

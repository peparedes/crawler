"event","ok, so i feel as though i should tell you that i realize that i said i would try to hang out with everyone a lot this break and then i totally didn't do it. reason: i've been going back and forth to CT because my grandma was very sick, and she just passed away this afternoon. i'm fine, its not like this was at all out of the blue, and really, its for the best. she hasnt been happy since my grandpa passed away two years ago, and since she been sick (for about 2 months) she really had no quality of life, as in she could really do nothing for herself. so i'll be in CT for the next few days for the funeral and everything, and then i go back to school this weekend, so i guess i'm going to have to push my ""reconnecting"" with people back a few months. but it will happen eventually, i swear. hope you all have a great spring semester!

penny passed away today. at the begining of thanksgiving break she was sick, throwing up every morning but behaving pretty much the same as usual. the last day of break she stopped eating, but still was pretty much herself. tuesday we found out she had cancer, apparently still wasnt eating and slept all day. and today she's gone. it all happened so fast. it just sucks. i dont really remember life without her. its not so bad right now, (although of course i had a good long cry session) because she wouldnt be at school with me anyways. but i know that as soon as i get home and she doesnt run up to greet me, well, i dont know how well i'll be able to handle it.

i just wanted you all to know in case you came over my house over winter break, when i'm sure you'd notice her not barking at you when you come to the door. and you should come over during break, cause i miss you all. even if i'm not the best at keeping in touch.

hope everyone is good, and hope to see you all soon."

do i stay blonde, or do i go back to the dark reddish brownish it was back around wiley time? (knowing that it'll be 3 months before i can fill in my increasingly dark roots). which is basically the cause of the question. otherwise i'd definitely stay blonde. but these roots are insane. i liked the reddish at the time, i just dont know if i will again. i figure i can go back to blonde in march if i dont like it. but thats a long time away. and i care about my hair way too much.

"event","hi everyone. i think its finally time for an update by me. its been a long time, i know. ok. so i should start with getting a few things out there that need to be said. i know some of you were pretty pissed at me after my quick visit to sharon back in september, and i'm really sorry. i just wasn't ready to go back yet. the way i handeled it was immature and stupid, and i know that and i'm sorry. its not that i did want to see any of my sharon friends. i did, and i still do. i miss you guys. i just kindof suck at showing it. and i know i'm still not ready to go back, but i'm getting there. by thanksgiving, hopefully, i'll be ready. this might not make any sense to you, but it does for me. its just that i was never truly happy in sharon. if you were close to me you knew that i really had no emotion. i never ever cried. i'm not going into the why behind that now, but there are reasons for it. anyways, in limiting those emotions, i think i limited all emotions, so i couldnt be completely happy, even if i tried. (way to be a shrink, caroline). but when i came here, that all changed, and i became a real person with emotions and everything. imagine that. i'm just your everyday pinoccio. but yeah. when i went back to sharon i could instantly feel myself closing up again, and i couldnt stand it. make sense? so i'm sorry if anyone felt that i hated them or any sharon people

fire alarm just went off. that was cold. anyways:

what i'm trying to say is that my recent cutting myself off from sharon has nothing to do with anyone. its just a wierd thing between me and the town. i know i'm a psycho. i've accepted that. please try to understand.

moving on!

i miss you guys. and i havent talked to most of you in pretty much ever, and i think thats dumb. i've been incredibly busy lately. i just finished working on urinetown, which was absolutely amazing. but now that i'm more free, you might be getting a random phonecall or two. i still am extremely happy here, although i have gotten over the initial shock of ""oh my god i love this place!"" but yes. 

recent entries by people have made me really sad. i'm so sorry some of you arent as happy as you could be. things will get better. they always do.

drood people! good luck! i know the show will be fantastic, and i'm sorry i'm missing it, but i'll be sure to get a full update. i'll see the next show, i promise.

ok, i think thats enough livejournaling for me. my door is always open to visiters, you'll have fun, i promise. i'll see you all at thanksgiving. and happy halloween kids. dont go too crazy.

"event","best moment of college so far:

after dinner last night a few of us were just hanging around in my friend tommys room, and we heard a bunch of voices outside the door having some super serious conversation. it was like, our RA pat and a few random other people on our floor. so we decided it'd be a good idea to lighten the mood a bit by blasting the macarena. yes, the macarena. and we open the door to see their reaction, and they are all dancing to it. so then we all go out in the hall and do the macarena. keep in mind there were about 15 of us, and the hall only fit 2 side by side, so we stretched across about half the legnth of the hall (its a long hall). this was followed by other great hits including livin la viva loca, the spice world, the cha cha slide, hey ya, and last but not least, bye-bye-bye, which sparked a boys vs girls dance off. seriously, you cannot beat my floor.

the rest of the night was pretty special too, but i'm not gonna go into. but i'm having a fantastic time.

well, except for right now where im avoiding doing homework, but thats sortof unavoidable.

ps, feel free to send me letters. i like mail. i'll write back."

-i'm a college kid

-i have the most fantastic room known to man

-i'm living on a beautiful campus in the middle of the ghetto where people get held at gunpoint on a fairly regular basis. awesome.

-my roomate is so sweet and shy and i love her

-the people an my floor are fantastc. havent met the drama kids yet. lets just say my friends here arent exactly like my friends at home. but they're first day friends so who know what will last. but for now, i love them

-i'm going to my first frat party tomorrow night. teehee. we were invited to one tonight but we were all too tired to go. but i found a connection and thats all that matters.

-i've never been around so many christians in my life. i know its normal for mmost people but its not for me. in fact, i dont think i've met anyone who's definitely jewish yet. i need some of my tribe. i'm sure there around. i just have to get to hillel.

-two words. school spirit. like woah. its intense.

i'm still in a bit of an awkward stage, but i have my group to hang out with so its generally good. i'm just scared about getting lost tomorrow when i meet up with the theatre kids cause i'm walking alone and dont know my way around.

-last point. my schedual= insane. my latest, yes latest class, is at 9:30. oy vey. thats 3 days a week. then one day (monday, which really sucks) 8 fucking am. wednesday i have class literally from 930 to 6, with only a half hour total between classes. good times. thats what you get for taking (not like i had a choice tho) 7 classes. the good part tho? i have fridays off, which means i have a long weekend every weekend. which makes life happy.

i lied. one more. cuse is called the school on the hill for very good reason. im going to have the tightest butt and most built legs you've ever seen once i leave here.

everyone is leaving tomorrow, i think. have a fabulous time, all, and i love you and miss you so much.

her name is elise gray and, of course, she doesn't have a facebook. well, there's about 6 elise grays on facebook, but none are from syracuse. one is in an '06 high school network so i guess that could be her, but she has like 700 friends and looking quickly, none were from 'cuse. so its probably not her. she acctually from syracuse, btw, like, the town. so... i dont really know what that means. but it must mean something. maybe she'll have a really nice mom who brings over fresh baked cookies all the time. maybe not.

but yes. so i'm living in sadler. i never looked at any of the dorms so i guess it doesnt mean much, but i have heard of this one before. i'm on a floor divided coed by wing, and mixed years. i'm living in a ""large split double"" which rocks because it says large right in the name. it has a wall that goes halfway down the middle of the room, so i'll definitely have my own space that noone can take over. and its the most spacious setup in the dorm, which rocks. and theres a dining hall in the dorm, so all those days when its too friggin snowy to&nbsp;step outside, i wont have to. and its right behind the carrier dome, so game days will be crazy. what else. um. its kindof far from the theatre, where all my classes are, but its acctually the closest dorm to&nbsp;it. (it's off campus, so its far from anywhere). and its just straight down one street, so i can't possibly get lost. which i still might. it might not really be that far, it just looks it on the map. we'll see.&nbsp;

know what i discovered? davy jones from pirates, you know, the awesome octopus faced guy? yeah, the actor who plays him is the same guy who plays billy mack, the awesome cracked-out old rocker guy from love actually. who woulda thunk?

and tom hollander, my new favorite actor, who is the blue-eyed brittish lord in pirates and the brown eyed incredibly awkward mr collins in pride and prejuduce actually has green eyes. wierd.

and when keira knightly was in&nbsp;star wars, she was only 14, and only 17 when she was in bend it like beckham. and i have an unhealthy obsession with wanting to be her, although not quite as strong of an unhealthy obsession as my wanting to wendy from peter pan. (not like, the 13 year old actress, just the character in general. i want to fly away to neverland with peter. and not be stupid and decide to give up all the magic to grow up.)

i need some serious therapy.

i also realized today that since qed ended, i havent talked to so many people, namely, all of the sophomores and juniors. i still see all of the seniors in class or at lunch or afterschool, but since rehearsals ended i never see so many people anymore.&nbsp;i never even talk to them,&nbsp;because i'm the unsocial loser who hates talking&nbsp;online or on the&nbsp;phone (face to face is the only way to have a conversation in my book).&nbsp;i mean, obviously i dont see these people&nbsp;in class, but i dont see them after school either. its quite sad. so in conclusion, next time you guys hang out, like this weekend or whatever, i'm crashing. whether you like it or not. cause i miss you. and&nbsp;i think i can spare one night away from the seniors, as much as i love them to. nothing personal guys, but every night with the same people is alot. i think most of you agree.&nbsp;edit: except for wellfleet. i'll leave you alone on that one. you lucked out. teehee.

we're almost done. as in so incredibly close, i cant stand it. i'm so excited. we're graduating. graduation!!!! yay!!!! oh man. cant. control. excitement. and i'm finally excited fro prom, which is a pretty big deal- that took quite a while. i think it's my necklace that made me excited. rediculously sparkly/ over the top jewlery makes me happy. and i got my dress shortened today. 'tis hot. i'm going to sparkle. thats the goal. to sparkle. and shine. i want to feel magical. damn, i'm a real dork. and proud of it!

this summer is going to be fantastic. it started already, i think, with a wonderful weekend. which reminds me, one of you needs to post your pictures of our wonderful camp fire.&nbsp; i want them. thank you. and this weekend should be good too. possible boston area 'cuse kids bonding, which i dont really want to go alone to, meaning i'd rather be going with sophie/ lindsey. wow, i must be desperate. this also means i'd have to talk to them about going together. can you say awkward? yeah. oh well. then saturday is umass which will be fabulous, then its only one more week!!!! ahhhhh!!!!

i really cant control my excitement. mwahahahah.

quote of the day: ""so i've decided that the reason for me being so incredibly brilliant is that i'm acctually a savant, minus the whole mental retardation thing."" thank you jenna.

i still dont know where i'm working this summer. the lady hasnt gotten back to me yey. granted, she said 2-3 weeks till she'd let me know and its been like, a little over 1, but i mean, i need to get my plans worked out. sitting aroud waiting is not working out very well. i need to go look for a backup plan.

"event","<p>well, this has been quite a lovely vacation. i got my much needed break from the dullness that is sharon. france was wonderful. since we had gone before, we didn't kill ourselves to see all the sights we'd seen before so it was very relaxing, and we got to see the cooler small stuff that you always want to see but can't because you feel so pressured to see the ""major"" stuff first. and it was quite the unexpected confidence booster, like woah. which always puts you into a fantastic mood. 'twas good. oh, and i ran into some sharon people, which was amusing, but it was in a huge store so i didnt see any of the drama gang.<br /><br />now i'm back in sharon, with only 20 days left of school. i have a feeling those will be 20 very stressful days. for some reason i have a ton of work to make up, not quite sure why. hm. but hey, anyone can get throught 20 days.<br /><br />i got a prom dress! not in france like i had hoped, couldnt really find any that i liked and that fit for under $5,000 (literally.) but at david's bridal, which is clearly just as good. i got relatively far on the dress that i'm making, and as careful as i was being, it's starting to look like either home-made or really cheap, so in conclusion, i dont want to wear it. its too much stress anyways. i cant speed up cause it'll look even worse, but at this rate i'll be really pressured to get it done. so yeah. the dress that i bought works just as well. and i decided that i dont care if anyone else has it, just as long as one of my friends dont (cause being in the same pictures, it'd just be awkward).&nbsp;<br /><br />so thats my life. 20 days. ohhh 20 days.</p>"

why does livejournal continuously change its setup? the new update-y thing looks so.... buisnesslike. or something.

so it was a nice v-day. no boy, but that's ok. really, i dont think i want one more now than i usually do. of course, it'd be very nice to have one anyways. secret valentine totally made up for that, though. best idea ever. etta got me wonderful presents, and i got 2 balloons which made me feel so loved, even though i basically demanded that people buy them for me. we'll ignore that fact.&nbsp;

so yesterday i got my major martha stewart on by baking butter cookies from scratch, which took up most of the day. i even made the frosting, which i was so proud of, cause we didnt have any in the house and just didnt feel like going to buy some. and they were all perfect hearts, which i cut out with a knife because while we&nbsp;have cowboys and turkeys and apples, we're lacking a heart shaped cookie-cutter. and i wrapped them up all pretty, too. can you tell i have no life?

my mom proof read my thesis paper and told my, ""it's not one of your best."" great. i dont care anymore.

my icon reminds me of ben and his bouncy ball.

i exersized tonight while watching HSM, which i taped last night. and it makes me uber happy to have a copy.

i haven't said uber in a really long time. remember when we used to say it, like, every other word? special times.

black and white party needs to happen. someone, please find us a house. just one night, that's all we need.

should i ask someone to prom? this whole waiting to be asked thing doesn't seem to be working. except my whole extreme fear of rejection thing sort of seems to be getting in the way. even if i'm 99% positive whoever i ask will say yes, that 1% still scares me. or having the person say yes, then finding out (or not even finding out, just guessing- i jump to conclusions) that they really wanted to go with someone else.&nbsp;ugh. normally i'm good at speaking up, but with matters like this, i suck. and why am i still stressed about this? because almost everyone else has a date, that's why. shutup, caroline. shutup.

one of my israel friends is going back tomorrow with her family for february. they own a house their. i'm jealous.

my grandma just figured out how to email, and is now sending me all sorts of random notes. it's cute.
first period study tomorrow. thank god. then i leave for chicago right after school on thursday. sweet.

ok, i should go.

love."

"event","<P>i've been compulsively checking livejournal/ other random websights in a pathetic attempt to put off this paper. i'm about half done, which isn't so bad. i'm so sick of it tho. i love how everyone's past like, 3 entries are all about this.</P>
<P>i leave for college in six months and 11 days. weeiiird. last night i chose meal plans.</P>
<P>i also did some senior trip research with etta last night. rounding high, it's gonna be about $400 a person for 4 nights 5 days. which if you think about it really isn't that bad. i found hotels right in the middle of the city for a pretty good price so we could hopefully walk to most places and avoid cabs, then we'd take a bus to and from, because if we drive we'd have to pay for gas and 5 days of parking, which is alot. then we estimated food (assuming we bring stuff for breakfast/ snacks, then maybe fast food-ish stuff for lunch, then real, but cheap restaraunts for dinner. one night we should go somewhere nice though, that'd be fun) and entertainment (whatever that ends up being). so yeah, 400 is what we came up with. i know it sounds like alot, but it's really not. we're cutting it down as much as we can. so now we just need a list of who's comming, so we can book hotels and w/e. so everyone, ask your parents right now. i think we should get a definite list as soon as possible, because prices might go up.</P>
<P>i'm so excited for this summer. and february vacation. a good time will be had by all. hopefully. right.</P>
<P>back to work. if i finish soon, maybe i'll get to play in the snow for a bit. that'd be fun. muchos love.</P>"

<P>i've been trying to, i really have, but i only have 2 pages done, and i have nothing left to say. i think thats bad. and while i know i dont have the 10 page minimum some people have, i really dont think i can pass in only two pages. i believe that may be frowned upon.</P>
<P>the shows were amazing. i'm so proud of you all. i can't even describe. to be quite honest, i was kindof worried about them (student directeds always make me nervous) but you pulled it together perfectly. AITT was better than tons of shows i've seen at festival, and OOTI was way better than so many musicals i've seen at other high schools, ones that are like, their big musicals for the year. you all rock.</P>
<P>sorry for crashing your cast party, though. i just have no other friends outside of drama, and staying home would have been depressing. you guys all make me happy.</P>
<P>well, ladies and gentleman, its time for my shstc rant. well, it's not really a rant, because rant has a bad connotation. ok, so here's my shstc ramble. right.</P>
<P>sarah levkoffs entry really got me thinking. there are still so many people in this company who i feel like i dont really know, and that makes me sad.&nbsp; so my goal for the rest of the year is to change that. i&nbsp;dont want to leave and be one of those people who people are like, i'm kindof glad she's gone, she was annoying, or a bitch. that'd be sad. it makes me so happy though to know how much people love the senior class, as a whole. every year we say, oh i cant imagine drama without the seniors! and know people are saying that about us. it makes me so happy. i think we've done an amazing job bringing drama together. the company as a whole has never been as close as it is this year. and next year, if i hear that anyone is being cliquey or elitist, no matter who you are, i will come back and kick you're ass. be warned. i know you're intimidated. teehee. and i expect you to all do the same towards me. as in, if anyone thinks i'm being obnoxious or exclusive, or anything like that (i dont think i am, though. i dont want to be at least) tell me right away. but yes, keep drama a family! and a cult. just because that's fun.</P>
<P>sidenote- i lurve the freshman. they're all the sweetest, cutest people i know.</P>
<P>prelims are in less than 3 weeks. i think i might drop down dead with excitement and nerves. georgi did say you can die because of stress. i'm trying not to get to that point.</P>
<P>costumes still suck. they're just ugly. i, however, am quite proud of myself. i've tackeled all of my most complicated sewing projects with this show. i've successfully made 3 jackets, one with full lining and facing. that's a really big deal for me. but other than that, they are becoming less and less my vision. i think it was a time issue, and a lack of sewers issue. but i had some cool ideas that i just wasn't able to carry out. now theirs just nothing special about them. it's not an issue of getting an award, i got 3 last year. i was content after one, i really dont need another. but i like being proud of them, and i'm just not.&nbsp; they're just so... dull. with an original show, i should have been able to pull off something much more interesting. w/e. too late to be killing myself over them.</P>
<P>prelims, 3 weeks. that needs to be repeated.</P>
<P>ok, time to get back to that paper. muchos love to all.</P>"

"event","<P>i'm still so stressed. and what do i do when i'm stressed? update, naturally.</P>
<P>i've decided that i dont really care about this thesis paper. and even though that's a blatent lie, i'm gonna pretend it's true. thank god joliceour didn't give us a page minimum. which means i'll be writting as absolute little as possible without it looking like i'm slacking. which i am. whatever.</P>
<P>so i come home from school today, and my mom goes, ""hey caroline! i bought you shoes for prom!"" um. thanks? i mean, yes, that's very sweet that you bought me shoes, and they are really pretty- but hey! i dont even know if they match my nonexistant dress! i mean, honestly, i have prom stressing me out. prom is not supposed to stress you out! it's just supposed to be fun. but it's senior prom, a night that you hear about from like, you first day of kindergarten. you dont want anything to go wrong. so i'm trying to work on my half-made dress from last year, which, if it comes out well, i'll love, and if not, well, i'm gonna buy a dress. which is why i need to finish it asap so i'm not in a complete time crunch later. then i just have to get a date. minor detail. ughhh. shouldn't be thinking about this. and the fact that every magazine i've gotten recently is about ""make it your dream prom!!! mehhhh!!!""&nbsp;doesn't really help. right.</P>
<P>still not a fan of the costumes. not that i was expecting my opinion to change from a week ago, but still. my creativity really went down the drain on this one. and the whole not being able to even start until, like, a month before prelims was kindof an issue, too.</P>
<P>whoever said that senior year was a breeze majorly lied. i'm counting on it all getting better after february vaca. by that time, i think the only thing we'll have to do is the psych project. and that's the testing small children part, so it should be fun.</P>
<P>so excited for feb vacation. chicago till sunday ( i thought it was tuesday, but apparently not, so it shouldn't be too much family overkill) and i love festival vacation rehearsals, even if they are the most stressful thing on the face of the planet. that's when it all comes together. i hope. and there needs to be some serious bonding time, every night. because this is really our last real time all together. april, a ton of people are going away, and summer is going to have some incredible times (a la montreal hopefully) but thats just the seniors (and some might not be able to come) and then everyone's working, so it's gonna be tough to get a night all of us together. then we're all going our seperate ways. awwwwww. *sentimental moment*</P>
<P>you know, updating really does help me to de-stress. that can't be normal. over and out.</P>"

<P>no, thats i lie.</P>
<P>i kinda sorta want to quit mrs dennis right now.</P>
<P>yeah, that's the one.</P>
<P>i'm sorry, but is it so unreasonable that i dont want to spend my friday night shopping for fabric and sewing, when i know i'm going to be costuming for 7 hours tomorrow?</P>
<P>i know, ridiculous of me, eh? what a bad costumer i am...</P>"

"event","<P>so basically, senior year, aka my time at sharon high school, is over. and it's a beautiful thing. i fully intend to just coast through the rest of the year, doing as little as possible. it will be great.</P>
<P>becca alves. with your ten thousand posts about high school musical, when i saw it was on this afternoon, i just had to watch it. oh man. um, cheesy beyond reason, yet still, its so good. sometimes cheesy is just what the doctor ordered. and incredibly beautiful boys with incredibly beautiful voices doesn't hurt.</P>
<P>and project runway is still a great show. i kindof think andre should have won this challenge- his was really unique and beautiful, and amazing how he incorperated his picture. but daniels was beautiful, too, so it's ok. kara should have been out, but i can't really stand zulemas personality, so it's ok.</P>
<P>basically i just watched t.v. all afternoon. and thats the way, uh huh uh huh, i like it. rock on. teehee. i need mental help...</P>"

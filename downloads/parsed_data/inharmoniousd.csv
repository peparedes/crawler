all of you should get off your asses and go to a bookstore and buy the book ""Slackjaw"" by Jim Knipfel. a really really awesome booook. you will find this book in the biographies/autobiographies. truly a great read.

still in the studio recording..this is the very beggining! set members are too three, still in the search of more, but who freaking cares. its all pretty fucking fun isn't it!!

So two nights ago, i went to the beach with my friends nelson, claude and jon, and we sat at the beach and watched the mooon set over the pacific ocean. it was really fucking awesome. it really opened my eyes to the fucking brilliance of the solar system....and airtraffic highways.

EMANUEL SUCKS!

But life and love and you and I are as beautiful as can be. 

Enjoy teh weather now, and feel free to crush your hands against the low clouds."

"event","alright you ladies and gentlemen how the fuck are you!?

So ""with herbi"" is my new band.we are currently working on our first LP. hahaha. WE have the first song almost completely recorded. its pretty nifty. the band consists of myself, matt (a 22 year old real estate agent), jon ( a 21 year old petroleum transfer technition), and derek (a 17 year old trapped in a 30 year olds body). the music is good. The words are better.


So i found the greatest thing in the world...sleeping on the couch. i sleep on the couch in the room of my hosue no one is ever in. its great, im completely left alone, and no one knows where i am.

not much is really new with me. its 4-20 and i am not smoking pot. i cant...which is a good thing.

i am going to san francisco next week with jon to go see NIN. ALSO i have the new nin album, thanks to miss hannah. its pretty good. songs 1 and 6-13 are good. songs 2-5 are just......

Fuck red lights.

I am very excited about the music being made. its really coming together tighter then anything ive ever done before. 



""Our relationship has been proven to only be conversational/no detachments of pride for a feeling of attachment for the soul for whom my thoughts fly about in repetive toungue speaking your feelings and bleeding your touch through acts given to stay departed/Rage and forever ending love given to the mind raked away by the echoes sounding to life/Chose to give in when there is nothing left to give in/speak the rose inside your head and maybe we wont feel so dead/To kill the sight the feeling and fight ive framed in my imagination/to give and care for an internal rest of undeniable emotional space/Hovering above the absence of clouds ive fallen to soon/fallen to build yourself around what you hope will be so new, what you hope will be you/ where were we when we heard the voice inside my head saying give in to your creature and give in to your time for here i will be waiting this time/this hope so lost as sorry as i came i leave knowing the same, waiting at will in water high waves. this feeling we crave has only been swayed/float away in you i start to hope we will be so new, a hope i might see. A dream made real for me when i started to floataway/ i see only you/i feel only you/i lose only you/i am only you.""

what do you know?

to name a few...

the nicest person at my work got fired. My assistant manager, Erika for a lame ass reason. so unbelievably sad.

my friend corey and i might be moving away. actually it just needs his and my approval and we are gone.

green day won best rock album-which leads into a long list about the fucked up ness of most current music which i think i shall refrain from mentioning. (i watched part of the grammy's)

bands like nfg the used and a simple plan think they are cool and talented.

aaron carter has had plastic surgery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thats the funniest thing ive heard since i last heard nick beasely do standup. Sit down!

ANIMAL PLANET ANIMAL PLANET!!! the hey americas funniest home videos about animals, and they have dog talent shows, and they have like G list celebrities like mad tv stars judge. fucked up.

distribution of wealth

take all the money thats put into animal planet and shitty ass bands, and donate it, then we can all sleep better at night.

And the want 
Of thought is death;

Corey plans on quitting his job at the gas station, and hopes to get a job at the local library. where he could submerge himself deep in books, and continue to expand on his writing, which i must say, has gotten quite impressive. i myself, plan on leaving torrey pines, and starting a new, with my music, my outlook with everything. with my head high and a heart full, and eyes open i shall do my own thing. i am recording tonight to try and finish  a song i am writing, i started writing this morning at one a.m. and it will hopefully be played at b.o.b. assuming we play.

"event","last night at ten, corey and i went on a walk to the donut shop down the street to grab a a donut and score some milk. WE were goofing around and, we got a hilarious messege from Rory saying ""Dude zombies. 805 is closed due to a police investigation. find weapons.""  we did not grab any weapons and join the fight against zombies...sadly. theeeeeen. a homeless man (urban outdoors man) came in to buy coffee with the 82 cents he had (with help from the tip jar), soo i got out my wallet and gave him all the cash i had left in there. He graciously accepted the money with a gigantic smile and left with his coffee to sit outside. corey and i then left and walked by him as he walked back in to get more coffee, he waved and gave me a great big smile that made me happy...

...then walking back, the crazyness ensued. i started to get really really sick. everything in my body was hurting, and i was getting very lightheaded. we had to stop walking a few times cause i could not really move, i was almost throwing up, but never did. sooo needless to say i was freaked out, and corey was too. we finally made it home, and we popped in a movie and watched. my body was twitching in a wierd way, mainly my feet, and i was still hurting. before the movie started i was out...

...i woke up the next morning to the buzz of my phone, it was gus! it was the wierdest feeling to be awake. i was so unbelievably happy. i was so fucking scared the previous night. but woah, god bless vitamin b complex. and from talking to corey, he said the night was fucking scary too, cause the walk home. we both didn't know what was happening. my right arm has hurt all day, but its not my left arm, so thats good.

soo What better to do on the day you wake up alive, then drive up to la, to go to a poetry book signing of your idol. so, corey and i drove up to l.a. to go to a billy corgan book signing. we were relatively close to the front of this massive line of crazy people. the signing was at the MASSIVE virgin records mega store. while up in la, we saw a movie, cause we had my mom hold our place in line. cause we had my mom there (she wouldn't let me go alone since it was raining, but mainly cause she wanted to meet billy corgan). the movie we saw was ""The Machinist"" a totally fucked up movie, that makes no sense till the end. Christian bale was the main character. it was an entertaining movie.   but to the point, i got to shake billy corgans hand!!! he has the fucking coolest hands ever. and he signed my boook. and (name withheld currently) was there!! and it was awesome, and my momyy got like 3 pictures. and it was awesome. And i bought a book and had it signed for sunee, since she was going to go with us, but ended up being unable to go, unfortunately.

and the red sox won the world series. 


and thankyou to all who called or messeged me inquiring about my health. i appreciate and love all of you. and i miss you all to death already, cause i have a fresh view of everything now it would seeeem."

A single bulb lights this room
It's dark in here all the time
If the cieling had only captured my dreams and nightmares alike,
     what stories it could show.
She is here, the one
The one i love, desire, devise, rescue, all to my hearts own sorrow
Im lost in this room, but this is the place the valentines are written
The site of my greatest thought and saddest song
There are no birds to fly over, no islands to reach
No sun to catch me crying
This is the gift of oblivion and opaque dance"

I have a sort of stalker, and its crazy, its nuts, i cannot handle the emotional stress of it. i was asked out be her today in a joking manner as to feel me out i guess. she started crying while talking to me today. and she runs after me!! if you see me with her, i ask you to do this: Grab my arm, pull my arm and drag me away. Dont look back... I should just find a girlfriend, that would have to scare her away. crazy.

Well i got a paycheck today. and shall i say it was a solid paycheck for many hundreds of dollars, the great thing is, just for the last two weeks of working. ahhh, its nice.

Mr. Eldred came into my gov. class today and was looking for the ""alliance"" then he quickly realized this was not where the ""allience"" was and left. School conspiracy? Is the schools underground bunker back in fulll service? Are they really pirates? well, just know, the ""alliance"" is gathering, WATCH YOUR BACKS.

The day was perfect
And well then someone ruined my day!!!! i bite my thumb at you!! have at you, bastard...

Well, work is still going well, besides the fact that i work too fucking much. But it is cool to build and work on custom frame work. The other day thomas and i framed, this map of al fallujah for this american soldier that just got back from iraq, the map was all charred up and had a few holes in it. we also framed with that the bullet and the piece of kevlar that saved his life. this bullet passsed through the map he was holding and hit him in the side. It was really cool to frame all of that and be part of building that. Thomas's brother is over in iraq right where the map that we were framing was of. so my heart goes out to him and everyone over there with him.

Reasons why my hands rule: I know ASL, I play guitar, I can juggle very well, and i am a certified custom framer, and...

JULIO is home, and there is nothing greater then that. He is currently conquering the westward world, or just stupid people.

(i was not on duty) he gave me a solid compliment, very real. haha. things are working well, although i sliced the top of my hand open today on a piece of specialty glass. i put my blood and sweat into that job.

I bought the 'tao Teh Ching' yesterday. very intriguing read. im greatly enjoying it.

I finished the music to a really good song yesterday. i drove to corey's to play it for him, he liked it alot, and we are going to start recording it. really going to spedn a lot of time recording it, cause i have sort of a vision for this song, and all the insturments and parts i want to go with. i am very pleased with the direction. I started writing lyrics to the music today, my vocals worked well in some areas, but will definately need much much work on a whole. but, im moving in the right direction.

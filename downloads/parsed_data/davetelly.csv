"event","So I was sitting in my apartment today, and I decided to put the movie Closer into the DVD player.&nbsp; This was a movie that I felt truely defined me as a person and for the longest time I couldn't really put it into words.&nbsp; I think I have a better understanding now of how it is a movie like that can define what I think of myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you haven't seen the movie, I would say you should, it is well done, and artfully rendered, but keep in mind it isn't by any means a happy movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So how exactly does this movie come around to defining me.&nbsp; Well on the surface level the film is about adultury, which one could see why that applies.&nbsp; One could argue that the film was an outward manifestation of my feelings about past events in my life.&nbsp; That isn't actually it.&nbsp; But the comparison could certainly be made.&nbsp; No the thing about the movie that I think so tipified me was that any given time I have felt like each of the characters.&nbsp; To some extent I view the movie as a whole, and choose to see each character as a manifestation of one single consciensousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So here is why I think I am more able to explain the concept of this movie and my empathy for it.&nbsp; Something about it doesn't apply any longer.&nbsp; Something has changed either in me, or about me I don't know which.&nbsp; I am just not the person who watched this film years ago.&nbsp; Which got me to thinking, if remembering this emotion brings me closer to the person I was when I saw it, what does that mean about the nature of people and change.
People do change, despite what angry skeptics will say.&nbsp; People don't change on purpose though.&nbsp; They change without knowing they did it.&nbsp; What happens to that pervious carnation of the self.&nbsp; I think they still lurk under the surface ready to reappear when the correct circumstances arise, and then bam that person gets a new if temporary lease on life.&nbsp;&nbsp;
As your life moves on more and more of these incarnations are born, some you like and others you don't, but all in all it doesn't matter, because ultimately you will hold dearly to them all and call them forth like an army of your own personal demons to defend you when you feel threatened.
So to bring this full circle, what the hell does this have to do with ""Closer"", while watching it I felt a sudden and unpleasent reconnection with that incarnation of myself.&nbsp; I didn't like it anymore, and didn't want to be that person any longer, which got me to thinking can I get rid of that persona...
I don't know but I felt it was worthy of asking anyone who still reads."

College is a system for control.  In this system a series of measures of a person are taken with the overall goal of determining the value of said individual to society.  The Ultimate goal of course is to make a good middle class corperate worker.  There is nothing wrong with this system except that at one point it was the undergraduate degree that showed the world that a person was educated beyond the trappings of the system.  Now that has gone by the way side.  This is not the matter to be disputed.  The reasons are perhaps more interesting.  The list of possible reasons is what should be suggested here."

Now before this bit of tyraid continues I want to make a few things clear.  I am not talking the its cool to hate everyone, or the jaded angry hurt teenager, or even the the world has treated me like shit.  No flat out people are the worst mistake evolution has ever made.  I will no begin to make a list of the mistakes.  As per usual your comments, concerns, disagreements are welcome.  

1: People lie about stupid shit, how hard is this question ""what's wrong""
NOthing difficult about that at all.  Instead we all say we are fine or ""Nothing"".  WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT.

2: People activily try to take from other people all the time.  Someone is about to get married I bet you 10 bucks that someone they know trys to them not too.  And let me say the reasons are not cause you don't want them to get hurt.  Nine times out of ten you can't trust the words out of peoples mouths.

3: People don't care about anything that can't see feel or touch. There is always this ""back in my day"" bull shit that people claim its just the current generation.  But seriously people no ever fucking cares about the abstract.  You didn't see a victorian movement to save the rivers and streams cause they were limitless... just as today, no one is actually trying to save anything till it actually runs out

4: WE spend our entire lives looking for someone, we find that someone an then we go to our friends and bitch about them... or worse we spend time trying to find someone else.  How FUCKING STUPID DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO SEE WE ARE A WASTE OF SPACE AIR WATER CARBON

5: NOthing we do lasts, even the pyrimids are decaying

6: Nothing we do matters, can anyone out there name the man that first stopped the muslim horde allowing for christianity to spread, allowing for the hitler, stalin, communism, democracy, race based slavery, (1000 other nasty things the Good Book has inspired should be inserted here)

7: Religion PERIOD

I don't know how many of you are in the shadows.&nbsp; I don't know how many of you are in the open.&nbsp; <br>

Although these are just simple words, they may help you to understand things.&nbsp; <br>

There he stands, completely clad in shadow.<br>
Villanious at first sight, and tormented beyond.<br>
Endless and foul ambition, let none stand in his way<br>
A cloak hides features, none will understand<br>
Faces tell so little, lest you see deep<br>
His less so, for every emotion is shielded<br>
Those shown through, trust only in dire straight<br>
Walking ever on has worn, tireless pain follows<br>
Something so strong, never willing to let be<br>
Trys to block out all, yet can't keep in<br>
Ripped to shreads, inner demons haunt<br>
who is he, why does he come.<br>
no moon or sun does shine, only foggy tempest<br>
Tremendous joy never felt, but demanded no matter<br>
what can't be demand must be forever granted, so say we<br>
Those he hurts on his journey, have never known him<br>
resent all he does posses, forever on we shall tarry after<br>
never peace will be granted, none is deserved<br>
struggles will he overcome, only to be replaced<br>
lifes eternal struggle, played out in one man<br>
ego and pride tis it called, but those with out shouldn't talk<br>
Every single in wake are bleeding, for time is noones friend<br>
and he will be slowed by none, friend or foe.<br>
What sought may be worth naught, matters little seeking will not stop<br>
the cloaked man, walkes ever on into shadow<br>
will you know this shadow man, or fea and walk against<br>
The shadows rise, will he step<br>
indeed gone, soon<br>
time is pressing onward, and the man will not relent<br>
A pheonix is also on his trail, light and dark to mix<br>"

"event","I am sitting here unable to sleep because my mind will not shut off the thinking part.  I don't know who else has ever experianced this rather annoying phenomenon, but let me say this I am annoyed with it.

I figure that since my brain won't shut the hell up I will give it something to do through my fingers.  ie: you all can read my deepest inner thoughts as I have them

BE WARNED THIS POST WILL NO LONGER BE EDITED, whatever pops into head will go into the post.

So why is it that women and men fall in love with each other.
What on earth can we do to stop this occurance
I wonder if I think about love too often
Really though what are the people reading this going to think
shut up dave its irrelevent what they think its your journal
on that note I really think that this will leave me naked to the world
Do other people do things like this
why do I keep worring about spelling errors on this
I should really prepare for history 200 today
but instead I will play pool and waste another bit of productive time.
I miss sleeping next to someone
shouldn't have put that one in there
oh well everyone out there knows I am an insecure moron anyway
self confidence is attractive I know but my ego's friggin huge
will people laugh when they read this
or perhaps cry
i really hated the UWMadison wouldn't let me use any comps without an ID from the school
Like I am a hacker or something
although I have thought about how cool that would be
I am really nervous about moving in with my brother
what if I hear them having sex
yuck
yuck again
the baby hasn't cried alnight, yet ironically I can't sleep so I can't even go comfort bradyn
hmm I wonder if thats really how you spell his name
Nobodies on AIM
that sucks casue I am going insane with boredem
Stupid spelling errors, I would fix them but then I would fall behind my thoughts
is it really important to keep up thought
what if I fall behind who would know
I would know then that would make me a liar
I hate lairs
I hate Matt
No one should hurt people on purpose
i would beat him to a pulp but I know that would be just as wrong
to top it off, i really like my hands shapped the way they are
his face would surely break at least one bone
yeah that was morbid
on to happy thoughts
lan party joy
going to see Joe and Sara Joy and a half
Going to treat Becca to a great little diddy about Jack and Diane...
that last one just didn't make any sense stupid song jumped in
two american kids doin the best they can
stop it song or I will sing barney
I am too violent yet nonviolent
I wonder if that makes sense
does any of this make senes
not really
do my thouthts have a clear pattern
or am i all over the place
wouldn't it be nice If i could just feed the ansers in insted  of typying
did you see how many errors were in that last one
grrr stupid brain I will tire you out
someong just IMed me I will now stop this post"

""Hello""
""You owe me an explanation, and it better be a good one""
""Who is this?""
""Dave""
""What are you talking about""
""Why are you telling my ex-girlfriend that I am sleeping with your ex-girlfriend""
""Uh,.. I have to go""

Ten Minutes later
*knock, knock, knock*
*long pause, observe person looking through peep hole*
*Door unlocks, _____ stands there looking at me*
""All I am asking for is an explanation""
*____ closes door*
*Get in car*
*Drive away*


You sir, are a coward, you simply had to explain yourself, but no you couldn't or wouldn't either way, count your blessing.  I don't want to see you, hear you, know you, or anything beyond that.  You claim so many friend like things, yet somehow come off like an asshole everytime.  I wonder if you would like it if other people meddled in your life this much.

There is more I would say, but in short ""GO FUCK YOURSELF""

To those of you not involved the names of the involved have been removed, because I do not wish to meddle in the lives of others, I merely wanted to point out that I was displeased.  If you do know who I am talking about great, I hope you dispise the person as much as I do."

The cage is all around me
If feels like nothing I can discribe
but it keeps me from using myself
every emotion denied to me
What I am feeling I just don't know
Sometimes I wish i could free myself
open the door and just step out
but that simply isn't allowed 
society won't allow such things


nevermind its hollow and empty with no real point.  The basic idea is taht i don't know what I am feeling.  TO further add to this, I can't ask anyone for help, because no one out there can help.  I am the one that made my situation and I have to live with it.  At some point I need to get it through my thick skull that I am a rotten person.  Depression is setting in with a vengence now.  What I will do i do not know

Good day"

Stong of mason's hand
built and crafted
only to stand

One act of free will
by a artisan in this
did create a wounderous leak
so small that none found it
the artisan walked way
knowning his damage done
soon the whole of the guild would know

Out marches the rains
they pound the sides
drench the foundation
weaken the shutters
causing leaks and cracks
slowly the water recedes
except what foundation trapped

Then came winter cold and bitter
full of discord and mistrust
wanting its own vengence on the home
it froze what the rain did start
foundations first crack 
brought by mason, rain, and snow
crumbling begins true

The guild return
in bonded brotherhood
to mend the damage rent
and so it was done"

"event","<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Disclaimer: </b>The following is going to be a tirade
about everything that is bothering me with the current political and global
environment, no matter how strongly I state something, I hope you will take the
time to respond.&nbsp; Even I know that I must have my beliefs
questioned.&nbsp; What I am saying here is I would like a debate to spawn.<br>
<b>To Dispel Rumors:</b> I do not any further attempts by the United States to
go to war with any nation until we have made good on our promises to the good
people of Afghanistan &amp; Iraq.&nbsp; If the Administration's current agenda
toward Iran &amp; North Korea lead toward war I will surely be among the first
to protest.&nbsp; That being said I <u>did &amp; do</u> support the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> efforts in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Afghanistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp;
I supported the invasion of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
but for the wrong reasons.&nbsp; I did/do believe that there are/were weapons
that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s
government had no right to.&nbsp; However going to war to disarm someone is
like shooting someone in the head to stop the brain from hemorrhaging, yeah it
works, but it isn't pretty.&nbsp; We should have gone to war to stop the
atrocities Saddam was committing.&nbsp; I blame George HW. Bush for first
helping put that man in power and for failing to remove him once he proved
himself a menace.&nbsp; I blame William Clinton for being so busy cultivating
his image that he couldn't make the effort to actually use the military he was
in command of (if you want a long list of his miscarriages of justice, both
militarily and domestically just ask).&nbsp; Lastly I blame George W. Bush for
his complete incompetence in giving the right reasons for the war.&nbsp; All
that being said we should have gone in, and even if we shouldn't have it
doesn't matter we must stay the course now.&nbsp; If we don't and we just pull
out as huge sums of people say we should then we will be only further weakening
our own moral values which brings me to the point of this whole damnable entry.<br>
<b>Moralism:</b> I heard a woman today on the radio saying ""What right
does the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
have to go to war with another country?""&nbsp; At first this question is
simple to answer.&nbsp; Obvious morals dictate that the answer is none.&nbsp;
Duh!&nbsp; Let us re-examine shall we.&nbsp; The sovereign free nation of <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
drops off Peacekeeping forces in <st1:City><st1:place>Boston</st1:place></st1:City>,
withholds any reason, and takes control of the local government.&nbsp;
""What right does the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
have to go to war with another country?""&nbsp;&nbsp; Total and undeniable
right would be the answer in this situation.&nbsp; The <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>kingdom</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName>Belgium</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> is happily enjoying its
Christmas when it hears over the radio; ""Forces from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
have been spotted sweeping through all major entries into the
country"".&nbsp; ""What right does the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> have to go to war with another country?""&nbsp;
<st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> has
decided to block all trade to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp;
""What right does the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
have to go to war with another country?""&nbsp; What I am getting at is
that this question is stupid because it can be turned to either light.&nbsp;
Furthermore, it can be turned to either light in either case.&nbsp; For each of
these I can present the same point another way that would take a different approach.&nbsp;
Simply put the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is a free nation just like other free nations it has the right to go to war
when ever it wants.&nbsp; If you think for a moment that it doesn't you are
sadly mistaken.&nbsp; Think about it for a time, what prevents us from going to
war... nothing except our own will?&nbsp; Yeah, the UN could impose sanctions,
WTO could call for trade bans, and <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region>
could bitch about it, but that change nothing.&nbsp; The right to go to war is
the choice of the sovereign nation that makes the decision.&nbsp; These people
that ask the question ""What right does the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> have to go to war with anther
country?"" are just plain silly. <span style=""color: red;""><span style="""">&nbsp;</span></span></p>"

MATTHEW: JEN IS NOT OBSESSED WITH ME!!!!, You are obsessed with your belief that she is, but she isn't, so shut the fuck up about it.  YEP THERE SHE DOES, NOW SHES PISSED.  Anyway to continue
Me and Jen were good, things were getting better every day.  I was waking up happy and going to sleep the same way.  I haven't been able to talk to Jen about how I am feeling for nearly a week now, cause I have been too busy doing damage control.  She is so busy being upset and suspicious all the time that she doesn't see how much I love her.  So here goes my pledge, my last ditch effort to prove my case. 

<U>All conversations with me on AIM, MSN, ICQ, & YAHOO will be saved, and if she wishes I will let her read them.  
ALL TEXT MESSAGES will be saved and if she wishes she may read them
ALL VOICEMAILS will be saved and if she wishes she may read them.  
</U>
I don't know any other way to undo the damage wrought by Matthew, 
Jen W. I know you mean to be my friend and if this upsets you I am sorry but thats just the way its going to be.  
Matt S. GO FUCK YOURSELF
Jen P. I hope this is enough
ANYONE ELSE: I reiterate, <h3>DON'T FUCKING MEDDLE IN MY LIFE</h3>"

"event","For anyone who doesn't know the title the next passage will make little or no sense.  

*Flying onward faster into the murk I drive, trying desperately to see in front of me.  During the old times when Strahd passed through he would have noted that he wouldn't be able to see his hand an inch from his face.  I myself passed through those mists last night.  In this time of modern things we don't like to think that there might actaully be a nether realm where demons lurk and vampire rule, but there is.  I know I saw it last night.  Here is that story.

Down Hwy 59 at a speed of maybe 60 mph hour my ebony contour races into the murk.  At first I think nothing of it, other then simple fog.  I call a friend to talk me through the long drive, however after a few short moments the line goes dead and no signal will come forth.  This I find truely odd, as I have driven this route for nearly 6 months and never once lost my mystical connection that US Cellular offered me.  I curse the demons that wrought my acursed phone and throw it to the ground.  Suddenly a wall of fog so dense I can't see beyond loomes ahead.  My inner monologue says ""BAH, I am Dave no force of nature, nore will of man will stop me.""  I lunge deeper into the dense suspended water.  Where Strahd had failed I would not, after all I had edison's miracle on my side.  

There is of course more I would like to write but unlike larry or anyone else for that matter, i am just not creative"

"event","You know those people who have nothing better to do then to butt into other peoples lives and spell disruption.  Some of them are simply fucked in the head and repeat what they hear and see, while others are out right blatent about it.  These people are the worse of the two, they hack into peoples computers, they assult peoples privacy.  They have no regard for the welfare of others.  To them life is without control.  So since they have no control of thier own lives, they choose instead to see if they can't manipulate the actions of other in a vain attempt at control
The list of these people is long in my life as I'm sure it is in most peoples lives.  I would like to go into detail about them, but I won't since to be honest some of them are your friends.  I don't wish to exert that kind of control.  I do have control of my life and my actions.  I know what will happen to me from one day to the next.  I don't really know how it is that people don't, but such is the case.  I will leave you all to the wonders of pondering this entry.

I personally want everyone out there who chooses to meddle in my life, to know that my reprisal will go deeper then words, if I lose control of my life I WILL react, and the source of the problem will pay."

"event","I looked around at my friends Journals, and my own.  I noticed alot of things.  I see that I and others have forgotten something in all of this.  Ourselves.  I myself posted more entries in the past twenty-four hours then in three months.  The election was and is beyond important to me.  I read reports from liberals, conservatives, and moderates.  I tried everything I could to be a truely informed voter.  I hoped and I prayed that I could make a valuable choice.  No amount of campaigning on either side was going to sway my vote, nore were any of the 527 groups.  
I listened also to the voice of my friends, the minority of which are liberal.  I again tried to see all the perspectives.  I extoled my point of view while they did the same.  I would like to take a moment and commend two people who made a point not only to be involved, but to express thier views with integrity, honor, and heart.  
Larry: I can honestly feel your pain, I hate the feeling I have about the future of this country.  I love it with every bit of my being and will continue to do so, but it does dishearten me to have another friend who so longs to leave a nation that allows out ideas so unfettered.   I care about your opinion and although I rarely agree I appreciate your point of view.
Nick: May the spirits save me from your point of views.  Sometimes they outright scare me, but you present them without need to change my mind on it, and you let me express my view.  Over the years I have seen you change and learn and diverge and ascend, and all while remaining on the same basic course.  I think that you would make a wonderful politician though, I hope you never do.  You force me to work harder to see the truth, and to watch closer for the lies.  I thank you for that and so much more.
I do not measure up to these two, and to be honest I don't think any of us do.  I read all our entries, and in the continuing intrest of moderation and information, I read journals of people I didn't even know.  I railed and attacked a friend of mine, for no good reason, I supported my choice without anyone knowing what it was.  Simply put we need to work together to keep this system alive and kicking, if you don't like Bush, don't wait 4 years, there are small elections all the time, and believe me they add up.  Bush couldn't do a thing if he didn't control the House, Senete, and half the governors in the country.
Friends and loved ones, put down your banners and agendas, and lets make this community of our, ours again"

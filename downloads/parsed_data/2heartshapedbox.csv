""People are afraid of themselves, of their own reality; their feelings most of all. People talk about how great love is, but that's bullshit. Love hurts. Feelings are disturbing. People are taught that pain is evil and dangerous. How can they deal with love if they're afraid to feel? Pain is meant to wake us up. People try to hide their pain. But they're wrong. Pain is something to carry, like a radio. You feel your strength in the experience of pain. It's all in how you carry it. That's what matters. Pain is a feeling. Your feelings are a part of you. Your own reality. If you feel ashamed of them, and hide them, you're letting society destroy your reality. You should stand up for your right to feel your pain."" -- Jim Morrison

I walked around my good intentions
and found that there were none
I blame my father for the wasted years
we hardly talked
I never thought I would forget this hate
then a phone call made me realize 
I'm wrong

If I don't make it known that
I've loved you all along
just like the sunny days that
we ignore because 
we're all dumb & jaded
and I hope to God I figure out
what's wrong

I walked around my room 
not thinking
just sinking in this box
I blame myself for being too much
like somebody else 
I never thought I would just
bend this way

I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh Mama running out of luck
But like my sister just don't give a fuck
I want to steal your innocence
To me my life it don't make sense
Your strange manners, I love you so
Why won't you wear your new trench coat?

I should have worked much harder
I should have just not bothered
I never show up on weekdays
That's something that you learned yesterday
Drive you to work so you'll be on time
Your little problems, they're not yours they're mine
Come on listen to what I say
I've got some secrets that'll make you stay
I just want to turn you down
I just want to turn you around
You ain't never had anything I wanted but
I want it all, I just can't figure out
Nothing

And all together it went well
We made pretend we were best friends
And then she said ""Oh you're a freak""
They ordered me to make mistakes
Together again, like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
But for the records it's all between you and I

I just want to be your slave

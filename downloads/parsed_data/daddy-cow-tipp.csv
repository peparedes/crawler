"event","...okay! i just read back on my last post and i didnt understand anything i wrote. hahaha! so yeah let me try it again.. sooo last night was pointless and i ran the risk of getting in worse trouble than i am in already.. let me explain this one: i had a disability meeting with allor at least of my teachers, they brought in their progress reports to me and my mother.. bad idea! cuz i have an F in history and most of my acedemic classes are mid to high Ds or the one class i have is C which is english. if im to get out of this fucking high school im gonna have to take my grades and everything i do in class seriously for the next few weeks. or i dont leave... so i think i also have to start signing up for the las potential placement test to see what classes i have to take and how im going to enter in that special engineering program.

Me and moma fight a lot. shes the only one i know that can piss me off to the point where i dont care what i do as long as something gets broken or smashed. i try to control it but she just has that magical touch.. i usualy dont feel the pain in my hands/arms though cuz im too angry. my trash can has a huge indent in it and has circles all over the place where my knuckles made contact. I almost always end up trying to hit a door but i dont hit it too hard cuz i know im going to break it and then its just another chore to take up time.. it sux i mean i try whatever i can but she just ends up making me mad all the time. feels good to let loose nonetheless! lol

mkay so what else could i write about.. well ill just say this.. im gonna go clubbing with gordo and ash next week when i will finaly be able to go. then im gonna go get a job when i dont have so much homework and shit to worry about.

ooooh i remember last night when i was at regal and there was a huge fight going on! hahaha that was so awsome! 2 gangs with like 8 people each just started brawling it out and then they started to use chairs and tables. then they just started throwing the chairs at eachother.. man they were fukin eachother up good hahaha! it was awsome. then this little short dude with a walkie talkie started chasing one of the guys. he looked a bit small for action but you ever know.. those koreans can fly and kick ass."

"event","ho,y shit! i havent seen such a long update in so long! okay so i have to say first off...what a night! i just got drunk with 2 of the crazierst girl people in the world... of course with my best friends ash and gordon. I dont even know them but they seem pretty cool! yeah so anyway i think their name were lauren and fuk.. what was her name?? umm lets seee, i think it was kristin but no that was someone else.. umm maybe it was.. fuk!! im so messwed up i cant even think straight. i hope my mom doesnt wake up and see me like this! oh shit id be grounded for the rest of my teenage life. or at least untill i get my ass outta here..

so these girls are hella loud and talk a lot when they drink..i mean i do too so i guess its cool. im drunk now and i loved them but when i wasnt they were like fukin whatever i dont know just not what i want..i guess. so besides that the substance tasted like shit and i saw 3 cops on the high way.. all pulled a car over infront of us.. as if we were like the lucky ones to survive the drunkeness and speediness..yeah of coruse we were doing a little more than we were supposed to.. its what teenagers do but yeah we never got caught and we will never get caught anywas..

im always naturaly high and never really focused completely but i swear...im not ever me when i get drunk or typsy.. i dont know what the fuk im typing about right now but i feel so goos os it dont matter anywayz... i know being drunk is cool but getting high is something i hate.. i promised my eX-GF that i would wear her necklace as long as i get high.. so ive been holding onto it for a long time and i cant let goo now.. its too much worth for me! so anyway moving on..

fuk im too fucked up to type anymore..later dudes!"

okay so its been christmas and merry christmas to everyone. i got a car stereo, mp3 player (zen microphoto), car speakers, cell phone (razor), and accesories for each thing. i love the nice clothing and pen as well thanks to the coolest family. i can hook up my mp3 player to my car so i dont have to bring along a shit load of CDs and a car charger so i can have it run for as long as the car battery doesnt die. i got a year-long subscription to napster.com so i can get unlimited shit for a year. getting that car put together took so damn long! i put the stereo together by my own hands and had dad help me out take the door panels off so we can put the speakers in. the new ones sound SOOOOO much better! lol its cool

before i didnt give a crap what happened because i didnt have anything in the car to loose only the car itself but now i have a stereo and i gotta make sure its locked whenever im not in it so theres no problem..

im waiting for the rear pair so i can get the whole surround be good shit. and darius was thinking about putting in a sub.. thatd be nice cuz a nice rumble would be cool!"

i edited some of my routines to make them a little different and better/smoother looking. hoepfully serge likes it! hehehe

Katie (president of drama in SRH & a close friend of mine) came to my school and met derek lol oh and everyone else i know in drama hahaha she loves derek a lot! im done

lets see.. i am really sore from all the running and lifting and yoga shit so im gonna have to stop till this battle is over with so i dont have to deal with any physical pains while im there dancing my ass off  and after that ill start my training up again.

kevin hsu performed at the talent show. all i got to say is nice job bro! i enjoyed it and it was one of the most intertaining too. butt hits..worm..robot..waving and raving. i loved it. the crowd cheered you on and gave you aprreciation i think thats better than winning some cheap paper saying 1st 2nd or 3rd place winner at some school talent show..good job man and good job everyone else especialy my fav local band citylimit!! thats all"

"event","i forget if i wrote this before but im getting back into my groove of doing hardcore training.

im gonna run every other day in two sections: sprint every other run day and long distance run all other run days

stretch EVERY day

then the days im not running im gonna lift 2 body parts per day. im gonna watch what i eat and make sure i take of myself more from now on. i need it if im gonna get any better physicaly. i lost 13 pounds of weight now i need it back but not crappy stuff. i need to make sure this time i stretch anytime im not moving weights around. that way i prevent going back to being unflexable. im not fat at all but i think ive gained enough fat incase i get in a fight. fat is a good guard for fights but i cant have a lot of it if im gonna dance so im going to have to try to keep a little fat.

ok so im gonna set a goal to learn bakcflip and windmill by this 3vs3 coming up.. i BETTER get it down! my victory could depend on it

so anyway thats my goals and thoughts for now. till later"

"event","the first ryhme was posted a few entries back..

2:

i was a fiend, before i became a king
this is the scene of the microphone fiend
i'm hold'n onto whats golden
for those who act up desirve more than to be smacked up
ya better hold ya breathe cuz i'll hit u with a blow of death
erase your ryhme, drop the mic, cuz your wasting your time
i got quality control that will rock your party patrol
let the ryhme unfold as i reveal the untold
if u can dance to the beat then get out there and move your feet
now back to the subject about me not caring about you this is my world and it jsut so happens that you're livin it too
you've been playin in the background, hows that sound?
i've been makin the show and rappen while you been sitin around crappin
you've just been bit and you're starting to smell like shit
i aint done here no doubt, the door is that way so please get the fuck out!
your not worth my time anymore so go fuck yourself you stupid whore
and please use protection cuz you dont want to ruin your imperfection
man you just got clowned so sit yo ass back down 

3:

I ne'er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet.
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower 
And stole my heart away complete. 

My face turned pale, a deadly pale.
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked what could I ail
My life and all seemed turned to clay. 

And then my blood rushed to my face 
And took my eyesight quite away.
The trees and bushes round the place 
Seemed midnight at noonday. 

I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start.
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart. 

Are flowers the winter's choice
Is love's bed always snow
She seemed to hear my silent voice 
Not love appeals to know. 

I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling place
And can return no more.
(i think i stole this poem)

4:

everyone is protecting you from me
talking a lot of shit to make me flee
trying their best to make me look like a ""foo""
but all i want to do is just be with you
i know it seems like an unforgiving war
but to me it is just another chore
because what is waiting for me at the end
drives my determination into a trend
im sure the person reading this is asking
why does he waste all his time tasking?
some things arent ment to be explained
but i'll tell them so they can save being sprained
first off i dont ""waste"" my time
and being with you was my prime
and to think that they try to get in my way
only tempts me to join their game to play
it's dumb and pointless but still very amusing
i know what to do cuz the game isn't confusing
making a mistake is just about the least i fear
all i know is that it is clear
that i dont have to promise that i'll be true
because all i really want- is to be with you.

5:

kills me to see friends all around me falling
as i stand here looking over them crawling.
yesterday i was just in their place
i wish i could trade places in this race
to take their pain away in swift- 
speed in trade for my gift
i understand what u feel and i will always be here
i remember they did the same and it took my fear
dont think u can't talk to me
because a friend i will always be. 

i know i made other ones but they all got deleted.. bummer guess ill just make another one for the loss!"

"event","ok so i went to this rad party. katie's sister sara hosted it! yeah so anyway they made a really funny video inviting ellan degenerate to come to the christmas party. i love that video.. and i was talking with this dude hole in the snow pit. i said hole..hahaha so he told me a story about his dog. kinda mean, a tad bit little.. but funny in a way so he went like this:

""so my dog was really old and it was gonna cost me $500 to put him to sleep. so instead i decided to overdose him with chocolate and stick him in the freezer. i mean, it was 90% dead already..it was like dying to death.."" DYING TO DEATH!?!? haha no shit bro.

and then theres this other kid talking too and he had an interesting story to tell:

""i was trying to teach my best friend how to play golf out on the course. i didnt know how bad his swing was untill he barely missed me on his swing and then cracked me on the side of my head on the back swing and shatterd my skull.. and then i had to get surgery and when i went to this party i met this girl and she came up to me and was like ""DUDE! you have head injury!"" :-D i was like ""yeah!"" and she was like ""so do i! i got hit by a car!"" and i was like ""i got hit by a golf club and it shattered my skull!"" and she was like ""uhhh..oh..right on!"" it was almost like she thought ""dude! you got head injury! we must be like twins or something now.."" all i was thinking is.. i dont know you.."" that was some awsome golf story hahaha like not that his head was gushing blood and he couldnt feel it but that the girl know him just cuz he had a head injury..freak

ok ok so i got one really short story to tell:
my classmate was sick for a week and when she came back so when i saw her i asked what was wrong and she said ""i got sick. it turns out that im allergic to real christmas trees. a fucking christmas tree KICKED MY ASS!""

oh and at that party katies neighbor came over and i think he was really really weird. he kept dancing with no shoes on hawaiian shirt and like silky flashy colored pants i dont know why he was wearing hawain stuff at a christmas party but the dancing he was doing was so weird and entertaining that we all stopped talking in a circle and pulled up chairs and sat there watching this dude do his dance. he asked someone to do a strip tease if he paid them for it...yeah..it was kinda a guy too, you know? like weird and stuff. he did a heel kick and some ballet shit and shouted out no choreography skills in here. like who gives a shit? so anyway when the life of the dancing party arrives (jenny) who is really hot/cute shows up he said ""ooh, looks like i got competition"" everyone sitting around the room watching him starting cracking up cuz this guy didnt really dance very good and hes weird and yeah..thats all

ok so i would be in reno right now but i guess no one wants to its nice weather but i dont think we will be since i got some stuff to do and i will be at nordtrom from 10 till who knows when ill get out. so i wont make it for one and two i need to buy myself a pair of all white pants. not jeans tho more like those basketball pants

i am now 168 lb and its weird. im not loosing strength im just loosing weight. so i must be getting even more compact because i can lift myself with 1 leg and i couldnt before and i can still lift 205 on the bench. i dont know how much i squat but if anything that is probably where i could have lost some muscle but i dont know for sure. it doesnt really matter since i can jsut do weight lifting for a month and get stright back to 175 if i wanted it that badly. all i want is to finally be able to make the iron man list. hopefully to get it up to 6th man if i can. or if i dont then i want to make the heavy weight lifter list again. i was 12th last year. the only thing, i know theres this huge sophmore in our school who is huge. like he looks like dylan T in mass and if he keeps up with it he'd probly beat everyone in scores. im gonna quit dancing class and take weights and see how good i can get before i leaves for good."

im gonna get my hair cut today but im just gonna have it trimmed. not cut off cuz i need hair for the things that i do and i look so cute.. long hair is like too much but buzz cuts suck. they make me look weird and headspins hurt somewhat.

im gonna enter a 3vs3 battle in 2 weeks. i got like NO time at all to sit around anytime this weekend. im either dancing, partying, visiting grandma, or doing a dance performance. that or homework. then next weekend im probly gonna be so pumped up for this circle battle that i probly wont be able to think about anything else. i dont know what will happen but i hope we at least win our very first battle. thats all i truely want. a fresh good start. winning dont matter but im gonna win my first battle thats all i know..

now back to this disease
like hit by a breeze
its the need to express
not always just to impress
must have moves and the dress
now make no mistake
dance to the beat without a break
express yourself dont fake
money is the prize, do not take
this must be learned
respect is earned
in the end, dont be concerned
just get up and do a turn

new favorite song..fade away by metallica:

Life it seems, will fade away 
Drifting further every day 
Getting lost within myself 
Nothing matters no one else 
I have lost the will to live 
Simply nothing more to give 
There is nothing more for me 
Need the end to set me free 

blah blah blah..song ends after bunch of other words..nice slow beat to it

i know that i just gave up so much of myself hoping for something that will never happen that i set up myself up for this. im no longer going to exist as this aaron anymore. aaron is too sweet and giving.. when im 18 im gonna get a tongue peircing, and no more of this weird emo bullshit.. wtf was i crying about most of the time? ...exactly..nothing..just so frikkin emo i was no longer myself. the real aaron never cried. ever. only untill it came around for someone's death.. its like i caught some kinda emo bug. oh well, i learned a little something and thats to not to care so much that i loose myself because some relationship seems to be too good to be true. thats a good thing too. well anyway i've gotta get some shit done..fell asleep like 9pm and got to get crackin on the rest of my homework.

this whole week has been so hectic with stuff everywhere in my life. school, friends, gf, future. then saturday came around.. it hit me like a runaway train. i had a showcase and one half of me made me feel so scared and frightened to do anything all day.. i just wanted to call it quits and the other half of me was ready to pump it up. so i went and none of my friends could come which sucked. thanks a lot ashley! gawwwd lol jk! it made me so happy and they had a huge freetyle session on stage right before they had the real shows. i went out there and made a few cool moves. i saw some guys do twirly back flips and sick stuff and OF OCURSE the black dudes did the harlem dance lol that was awsome. and through the entire day i think i went through like 27 text messages that were mostly to ashley.. woot! lol oh and did i mention right after i hung out with her at her house? then i went home and fell asleep at like 3am or close to it..i dont know why i panik'd and freaked out..saturday really paid off big big time for everything!

now for today.. ehh, im not sick and im not tired. i had a talk wih ashley last night that didnt effect me till today but i woke up this morning and listened to vitamin C- graduation song (friends forever) and it made me cry horribly. i just broke down to nothing. the convo wasnt that bad but this song amplified it and made me really sensitive to anything sad. so the lyrics were almost same to the convo we had. talking about growing up and where we will be in the future. i kept thinking about how we would end up going to college and somehow change or something. i dont know and i feel a little scared for the future. i mean i got a full on year and a half and all.. and then when i heard the words in the song: ""..cuz we're moving on and we cant slow down. these memories are playing like a film without sound..."" i know i'll have the time of my life with everyone here but i know some day i'll be older and look back on all this and miss every ounce of it. im sure things will still be the same for a long time with me and ash but i just feel scared and hurt when i know that somethings may not last, some do but the trend says theres an end to most things.. but then i think well it'd take a lot to change us.. soooo how will it really affect what we have now? thats just the thing.. im scared for moving on. i dont mind going somewhere else thats out of SR with her or a friend or even my big brother.. i just feel like ashley has become the best thing that has happened to me and i cant just say goodbye to her when we might have a little distance between us. same goes with my best friends too.. and family is family we cant be seperated..period. i know that brittany is going to try to move out with her real mom and go to germany. wow..long fucking way to visit her again. gordon will most likely stay here and go to DVC and might even move in with dante.. i mean he'd have to pay for his own food but rent is free. not too sure what hes planning for in his life. victor has moved to concord. no comment, just a little far for me to drive and chill with him. kevin is going to try for cal polly or may go to sac state. i wantedto go with him to cal polly but if my grades dont cut it after DVC then i dont think i'll be chilling with him in college. bret and peter want to go to butte. probly cuz of all the parties and freedom they will have out there.. i may go to san jose and transfer in. i dont know but all i do know right now is i wanna do a year of DVC and have the choice to move out right then or stay for one more year if i like it how it is. geeze..just so much. im a little overwhelmed at the moment.

i really need something right now. like a hug or something.. im just a little emotionaly unstable. i got some homework to get done too! fuking school..

ok so on a different note.. i have practice from 3:30-5 on friday. its for my nordstrom show this weekend. i am going to perform some breakdancing at nordstrom on sunday. the time is unknown right now.. but i'll talk to people to let them know whenever i do know all the info on it. i hope u guys can make it! gonna be fun. ok well i think i'm done for now. im gonna write later whenever i get a little more sleep

later duuds-

"event","i had to cut the last entry off short becuase i was about to fall asleep. anyway im here again and tomorrow is the big showcase. im ready to show what i got but i need to practice some more right now cuz im fucked if i go out there like i am now! i cant seem to get one part right and its killing me! if i dont do my best omg im just going to die! the fuck with this stupid world you know? like i feel like if i screw up then im no good at anything...thats how i feel right now. slightly shitty, nervous, excited, and i dont know what else im just kinda freaking out right now and not JUSt the showcase but other things and im just not feeling life right now.

lets just say.. i came back from dance class not feeling like i usualy do. satisfied and happy about it. im doing the moves but i need to be a little more on beat and i need to memorize that part i cant do very well on. its good thing its small 24 count set, but they see the only big guy on stage fuck up and its gonna be look horrible. im the only guy there that towers most of the short ones in front. IM NOTICABLE! not good! im going to fail and its going to be the last time i sign up for any contract with any dance team..

i need to go lay down and sleep and hopefully never wake up.. not literaly i just need a lot of rest..

im definatly going to do well..gotta go over it constantly thats all. just need to get some practice in there. im going to crush this show lol

ill write later i cant think"

"event","been a while since i updated..so i went to spain for native slaughtering day

it was spain-takulis.. i went to a big rock and had apes climb ontop of me. then pick through my hair like i was family.

then i held a snake wrapped around me.. its nothing different then when i went to taiwan and drank snake bile.. yeah. bile isnt really good or healthy but boy did i feel apart of the weird culture.

oh random but i cant stop playing with my hair.. its longer, curly, and bounces back in place.

me and ashley are still doing great. thank god i found the right one, you know? like i can finaly rest knowing everything will be just gravy.

back to spain.. it was fun. i bargained with the sellers there and got 3 different sized african drums. they're all pretty good. i suck right now but my brother who is better sounds pretty cool when he plays it.. so maybe i'll become good if i practice enough. sometimes i jsut dream too much

so i saw the country side and castles and all the neat stuff out there and gosh i love it there. i dont speak spanish very well because i havent kept up with it but thats ok i got by easily enough.

ok so i have a showcase coming up for hip hop. its the first time i have done any kind of dancing in front of people like on stage i mean. at the last meeting i really put my full into it and i enjoyed it so much. i hope i can do this thing tho i mean theres one part where i have no idea what the eff im doing.. its at Julia Morgan Theater 2640 College Avenue, Berkeley at 5 Pm on december 3rd. i dont know how much it is to get in but its going to be hot! so come see for yourself!

i havent been sleeping very well. like i sleep in the day and at night, wtf?"

"event","wow it's been a long time since i last made one of these and updated it.. i think it was last year.

ok so i'm going to just talk about my life as it is now. try to make it not super long if i can so here goes:

ok so of course im a senior at cal high and i'm liking it so far. i have to say its a little harder this year than it was most of my other years. i didnt take all the hard classes in my other years and its starting to bite me back. its ok though.. i like it how it is right now. i am enrolled in a dance team and we are having competitions and rehearsals like crazy! every friday from 6-7 and usualy sundays at 3-6 but sometimes its both sat and sunday. i have no job but i am looking for one, and hopefully i will get one soon. i drive a '95 pathfinder and its really sweet. i think christmas is coming up here pretty soon and the only few things i want is a new car stereo, a working pair of speakers and maybe an ipod. oh! something exciting i just remembered im going to go to spain on thursday and its going to be for a week and yeah its going to be awsome. i'm leaving school at 12ish to go and not looking back, just a nice and fun vacation away from here. i need it! geeze.. so hard to relax sometimes when everything is ""go here, go there run around like little headless chickens! blah blah blah!""

i'm 5 9 and 173 pounds. i breakdance and i usualy just start dancing out of nowhere but usualy only if no one is watching or if its around people i dont know. i hate when people say stuff like do more do more! gahhh thats so annoying.. i've been practicing bboying for about 9-10 months now. its really fun! i even own my own dance floor with mirrors and all. i'm in a brand new crew called the ""Katalyst"" and i think we're ok. we are always practicing and always challengin eachother which is really good.

i have a girlfriend by the name Ashley shes so awsome and one of the best things that happened to me. everything else you can just ask me personaly.

i am working on a project to build a forge. you know, the kind that you heat up metal with and bend it and twist and all that jazziness. i think its a great way to make something out of old used equipment. it also gives you something to do if you got nothing else planned and i already made a candle holder and a spoon, knife, and fork. im usualy trying to make up new designs but with all the rehersals and dance routines going on i got a lot to be thinking about.

when i know the dates of my showcases and competitions i will post them here, but only as they come i dont know everything just yet.

alright well i think i've covered everything. im out! 'till later days"

i think Mr. 'Stache is one of my favorites so far.  i was pretty psyched to get the pink eyes-- i had to order them from CR's Crafts online because i couldn't find any around here.  

of course i had to make a beaver.  her tail is plaid on one side and fuzzy on the other, and her coat is shiny soft.

the yellow cat has a stunted tail, which i believe adds to her charm.  the pink noses also came from CR's Crafts."

"event","i decided that this years i am going to keep a list of all the books i read and of all the movies i watch.  i want to read at least 100 books, and see as many movies.  this is what i've got so far:

<b>books</b>
<u>in the little world</u> (John Richardson)  a journalist befriends a group of little people (dwarfs, for the less pc).

<u>countercultures</u> (William Zellner)  a sociologist looks at a half dozen social groups, including the moonies, skinheads, survivalists, scientologists, and satanists.  for a sociologist, the author was pretty moralistic and judgemental.

<u>survivor</u> (Chuck Palahniuk)  i do love the chuck.  his bizarre plots, strange characters, and seamless writing make me want to finish the book in one sitting.

<u>diary</u> (Chuck Palahniuk)  i liked this one, but not as much as his earlier books.  

<u>case histories</u> (Kate Atkinson)

<u>ruby</u> (Francesca Lia Block and Carmen Staton)  finally, flb dives headlong into the witchery she usually just hints at.  

<u>nymphomania</u> (Carol Groneman)  a social history of the diagnosis

*<u>Saints and Strangers</u> (Angela Carter)  i really love her writing.


<b>movies</b>

<i>children of men</i>  a gripping, if rather obvious, story of redemption

<i>stranger than fiction</i> i love the part where the professor is asking will ferrel all the questions to determine what sort of story he's in.  gotta love a golem joke.

<i>the night listener</i> based on the maupin book.  reminded me of the jt leroy scandal.

<i>schizo</i> takes place in actual kazakhstan, which is surprisingly similar in many ways to its depiction in borat.

<i>proof</i> gwyneth paltrow is not an actress i usually like, and this movie is far from a masterpiece, but how often is a movie made about a crazy math genius who's a chick?

<i>writer of o</i> a documentary about the author of that famous naughty book.  

<i>pan's labyrinth</i> instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time.  a visually amazing dark fairy tale.

<i>notes on a scandal</i> hurt so much to watch!  dench plays a manipulative woman who is stuck in the mode of victorian romantic friendship.  the desire makes her crazy.  

<i>dead man</i> jim jarmusch western starring johnny depp (beautiful as always) as billy blake, who is taken for the poet william blake by an outcast indian."

there is no date on the tape, but judging from its contents, i would guess that it was made around '92... or maybe '93, because isn't that when the godawful meatloaf cd ""back to hell"" came out?  the mix itself is on one of those very early 90s memorex tapes, the ones with blue, yellow, and hot pink on the cassette.  the handwriting on the insert is very careful.  was it a plea to a would-be lover?  was it appreciated?  or did the intended balk (as i did) at the inclusion of something from ""beauty and the beast""?  was it love, and then did it fall apart?  so many mysteries."

"event","last week i finished reading <u>in the little world</u>, a book about little people (also called dwarfs, midgets, or vertically challenged).  the author, a man of average height, went to the Little People of America conference on a journalistic venture for Esquire magazine, but even after he wrote his article he carried on friendships with the people he met.  it's clear he's a smart man, but there was one hurdle that he couldn't clear: he couldn't stop seeing the little people as <b>wrong</b>.  he called their bodies wrong, and could not understand why it was so devastating to his friend andrea that it threatened their friendship.

i identify so strongly.  a few months before we broke up, my ex admitted that she would be more attracted to me if i were thinner.  i had always suspected it, but she denied it over and over again.  when she finally admitted it, she acted as if it were a no-brainer.  like, duh, your body is wrong and of course i would like it better if it were corrected.  i knew that was the beginning of the end.  a lot of people think fat is monstrous-- that i didn't find as devastating as the fact that she denied it for so long.  that i felt safe when i was not safe.  that for 5 years i had bared myself to her and all the while she was judging me.  

<u>in the little world</u> was laced with references to various theories of beauty.  all boil down to: what we find beautiful is not as subjective as the eye of the beholder, but rather as constant as a mathematical formula.  beauty is symmetry and evolutionary biology.  beauty is big eyes and fertile bodies.  no doubt there's something to that, but how boring, how utilitarian, how fatalist.  i don't care if i miraculously lose one hundred pounds and develop a waist-to-hip ratio that makes millions of men want to breed with me, i refuse to accept a genetic computation of beauty.  

we are human.  we can choose deviation.  we can invent.  we can <i>invert</i>.  instead of loving what we find beautiful, can't we find beautiful the things that we love?"

""babylon the great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth.""  

two things about babylon:
1.) how big is this whore's forehead?
2.) i am considering making ""the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth"" my e-mail signature.  

next to the artistic rendering of babylon the great, who apparently works part time on the cover of trashy romance novels, bold italicized text asks the reader: ""Do you know why 'Babylon the Great' is portrayed as an immoral woman?""  ooh! ooh! i know!  is it because the only thing scarier than an angry smiting god is (of course) female sexuality?"

"event","apparently the other day a nasty lady who was angry with the offer made on her books suggested that we (the employees of the used bookstore at which i work) read a recent editorial in the cap times.  dutifully i looked it up.  the writer of said editorial felt that the amount of money offered her for her used books--not at our store, but at madison used bookstores in general-- was insulting to the integrity of books in general.  

i very much wanted to respond with an editorial of my own, but my boss said this would be verboten.  so instead i will rant here, and i will feel free to snark until my heart's content, because here i represent no one but myself.  

it is easy to be high and mighty and talk about the integrity of books when your paycheck does not rely on it.  to some who eschew economic reality in favor of lofty ideals, it may even sound honorable and intelligent.  however, i feel the need to point out that <b>if you think your books are so goddamn sacred, then why are you selling them to begin with?</b>  shouldn't you keep them holy like the sabbath or some shit like that?  or at least give them away to the book-impoverished?  i think that's what jesus would do.  

i am reminded of the adrienne rich poem <a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/poetry/philosophyofkate/recommendpoets/adriennerich/burning.html"">""on the burning of paper instead of children""</a> and while i cannot say that the burning of books arouses no sensation in me, i can say that someone so distracted and self-righteously indignant about the disrespect of a mere symbol (a book, a flag, etc) probably has her priorities out of whack.  

the woman who wrote that editorial would like us to think that she is angry about the treatment of books, because that would make her selfless, the defender of the wronged.  but she is just angry that she did not get the money she thought she deserved.  books have no sense of entitlement; people do."

"event","this time of year always make me think about boys-- one boy in particular-- who have liked me.  there was really just one year of my life that i actively practiced the way of the heterosexual, and it began and ended in the month of december.  those were twelve very strange months of artlessly wielding my femininity.  my behavior could best be described as that of a mentally unstable lolita.  i was good at pretending i liked the various tasks that being heterosexual entailed; i thought that i was supposed to be into it.  the boy was not so much appreciative as he was scared.  he found it intimidating, and i made him nervous.  in any event, december broke the spell and he was off to impregnate some other girl.  i did the math and their child is now a teenager.  damn, i feel old.

now i want nothing more than to explain to this boy that i was faking it all.

being called a liar so much when i was younger has given me a complex.  i can't stand being misunderstood.  i have a pathological need to clear my name, to plead my case, to grab any ear (or in this case, eye) that i can.  

a while ago at work i made a joke about rejection to a coworker, and she scoffed as if to imply that i knew nothing about rejection.  that surprised me, because, hellooooooo, do i not look like the pathetic sort whose entire adolescence was full of rejection?  are we missing the adult acne and rolls of back fat?  anyway, i tried to illustrate with some of my favorite stories of rejection.  to me, the most heartbreaking tales of rejection always start with someone liking me, because it's one thing for someone to reject you right away without knowing you, but it's a special torture to get a little vulnerable before the kiss-off.  so i told the story about the girl who told me, in the thick of a fairly intimate moment, that she was not physically attracted to me.  (sadly, this situation was basically repeated with a different woman about a year later.)  i also told the story of the pentecostal girl who, after i had, uh, pleased her (and it seemed appropriate for her to reciprocate) announced that she didn't think she could go through with something so contrary to god.  these tales, my coworker said, were bragging tales because i was <i>getting some</i> in them.  yeah, so why the fuck do i talk about them in therapy so damn much?!  so i got their panties off.  but they didn't want <i>me</i>.  they thought they were into me, until they were faced with the reality of seeing me, touching me, actually being with me.  OUCH.

"event","sometimes i am an excellent judge of character, but sometimes my lack of self-esteem makes it easy for people to fool me.  i come around eventually; i'm not that dense.  and when i do come around i can't let it go very easily.  i have to marvel at how wrong i was, analyze the situation to death, ask myself what left me vulnerable to that particular illusion.  i was just thinking about some of the people i once thought were ""cool"" but now know better.  don't worry, it's probably none of you (unless you are reading and i don't know it).  it's alarming that someone can just waltz into my life and treat me like shit, and i draw the conclusion that they must be cooler than i am, when in reality it's so transparently obvious that they are the sort of small person who is made to feel big by belittling others.  which is not cool.  you dig?  man, too much wine.  definitely too much wine.  (and whine.)

yeah.  so.  today we celebrate the birth of a child who brings redemption.  despite my angry teenage years denouncing the catholic church and embracing radical feminist witchcraft, i kinda like the jesus story.  story being the key word.  the idea that innocence can save us, that i like.  i'm not so into all that stuff they added after the little dude grew up and got crucified.  but i know that i have felt darkness and seeing charlotte's face has healed me.  i know that through her i can reconnect with my own innocence.  i can let everything else fall away.  i can be sinless; i can feel the kingdom.  

ok, the wine probably helps."

"event","in my last post i forgot to say something about freud.  what's a discussion of perversion without a nod to freud?  

the psychologist in the documentary commented that pedophiles' psychosexual development had been arrested at some crucial point, and that each time they molest it is an attempt, in a sense, to engage sexually with someone of their own (psychosexual) age.  

in a way that makes sense.  about 30% of imprisoned pedophiles had been abused themselves as children.  it's the disease model of pedophilia-- someone with arrested sexual development abuses a kid, who in turn is arrested in his development, who in turn will molest another...

i realize that 30% is not 100%, but it's not a statistically insignificant number, either.  what makes one boy grow up to offend, and another not?  what conditions make a child a receptive host to this disease?  

i did a little web research to see if i could find any good studies, but the first thing i came across was some guy talking about pedophilia as a sexual orientation.  very disturbing.  his assumption is that there are an equal number of children with gerophilia who seriously get off on being with older men.  the error here, i think, is that we're talking children under the age of 13.  the diagnosis of pedophilia as an illness (a paraphilia) is generally only made if the child is prepubescent and the adult at least 5 years older.  i just can't believe that a prepubescent child has all the necessary faculties to form consent.  and sex without consent is not an orientation to which i will grant legitimacy."

"event","yesterday anne and i went to see te movie ""deliver us from evil"", a documentary about a pedophile priest whose assaults were concealed by the catholic church.  each time a victim came forward, father ollie was simply transferred to another parish.  

the film was far from the generalized anti-catholicism diatribe i expected it to be.  it has some good analysis of why this happened within the church, and why it was not properly dealt with.  thomas doyle, a catholic activist for survivors of abuse, points out that in the catholic church priests are considered chosen/pre-ordained by god.  (children have a hard time tattling on god.  besides, there's precedent for it in the bible: mary got knocked up via the holy spirit.  plus all those old testament stories of faithful barren women becoming pregnant.  god really has a problem keeping his hands to himself.)    

also, a psychologist who specializes in treating abuse survivors was interviewed, and she said that if you think all sex is sinful, then you do not necessarily make the distinction of one kind of sexual interaction being harmful and another being healthy.  it's an interesting point, and something i have always believed-- i mean, if you do not allow the priests to marry, then the priesthood is going to attract men whose sexual proclivities are either clandestine or non-existent, and which do you think is more common?-- but more than one person in the movie mentioned homosexuality as a sort of special sin.  i mean, father ollie had sexual contact with both boys and girls, but the first incident was reported by a girl.  a member of the diocese actually testified in father ollie's trial that because it had been a girl and not a boy that the father's inappropriate touching was just ""natural curiosity"".  what the fuck?!?  that was the man's defense for his part in the cover-up.  the priest was only sent to counseling when it came out [(accidental pun)] that he had molested a boy.

the female survivors interviewed described ""games"" father ollie would play to work up to the abuse, but the guys said he just jumped right in.  i wonder why the different approaches?  

i'm about as far from catholic as one can get, but i'm fairly certain that in heaven there are no pervy priests."

"event","my cousin dresses her son (who, like Charlotte, is almost 2 years old) in ridiculously elaborate outfits that are often completed by suede cowboy boots.  Char, on the other hand, wears mostly comfy leggings and sweatshirts.  i was talking with my cousin about it, and she said, ""It's fun to dress up little boys like little men, but it's not so fun to dress up girls as little women.""  

i agree there's something very creepy about all the trendy toddler clothes for girls, especially the shirts that have gathers to suggest breasts.  but more than just that, the implication is that there is value in being a man-- that little boys dressing as grown-ups demonstrates an aspiration to higher social value-- but that a girl growing into a woman represents a <i>devaluation</i> of sorts.  one can be mama's little man but no one is mama's little woman, because a woman is a sex object and thus belongs to any eyes that consume her. 

needless to say, my razor-sharp cultural critique was not very popular at the family dinner table."

when i told my therapist that the recent sex assaults around town have put me on edge, she asked if i was afraid of being attacked.  i thought for a moment, and was surprised to hear myself answer no.  or if i am, that's not what i find most troubling.  the most disturbing part of the situation is how all the talk on the news keeps it always on my mind, and in my vigilance i am all too aware of my capacity for violence.  it's not just that i think about defending myself, dreaming up strategies to fight off attackers; i entertain violent fantasies.  i think about what it would feel like to gouge out eyes.  i think about biting off ears.  

at the pizza place monday night charlotte was running a ways in front of me when i noticed an old guy crouching down and calling her name (which he managed to overhear as he lingered near our table about ten minutess earlier).  he was gesturing for her to come to him; he did not see me.  we were at the rocky's party pizzeria, and there are often kids running around.  and you know, i realize i'm paranoid, but the way this guy looked at charlotte made me sick to my stomach.  i lunged into his view and gathered char up in my arms.  he stood up very quickly and pretended to be looking around for someone.

"event","yesterday in the newspaper i read an editorial from some ""reverend"" that it was an atrocity to compare the marriage ban to jim crow laws, because african americans cannot change the color of their skin but ""thousands of homosexuals have changed their orientation"".  also, african americans as a people never hurt anyone, but homosexuals spread AIDS.  every day i have moments like this, during which i feel so de-realized and alien, and i look at my hands to see if i am suddenly a giant cockroach.  and then i get so angry, because <i>who the fuck are you to make me feel less than human?</i>  

but wait, i sat down here to process my respone to the reverend.  i don't disagree that there is a certain danger in taking the black/gay analogy too far or too literally, but really, let's examine the flaws in the rev's logic.  people do not change orientation.  people can alter their actions and live dishonestly, presenting themselves as something they are not.  in the past people of color have ""passed"" as white in order to avoid the stigma of their race, and women have ""passed"" as men to gain the freedom and privilege denied their sex.  & AIDS?  learn some science, dumbfuck.  AIDS is more likely to be transmitted by anal-penile penetration NOT because god hates fags but because of the exchange of bodily fluids.  lesbians are the least likely to contract and spread the disease through sexual contact, but that doesn't mean jesus has blessed us.  

and what does this have to do with the marriage amendment?  do you think that denying us rights is some sort of bargaining chip?  you can't bribe me into liking cock.  you can dress it up however you'd like, rev, but my desire is not a petulant child from whom you can withhold dessert."

"event","i am up laate reading t cooper's book <u>lipshitz six, or two angry blondes</u>, and already, only 65 pages into it, i know it is an amazing book.  it's a difficult book, too, & is based in large part on cooper's family history as russian jews.  i cry and i think, this is so amazing, to have made such a beautiful thing from the terror.  for some reason the thought, ""his partner must be proud of him,"" floats through my head.  and suddenly i'm crying for me, out of fear that i will never make anything beautiful out of the contents of my ptsd-addled brain, that anne will never have a chance to be proud of me and i will die selling used books.

















[note: dude, i know the book is not a bio, and i know that the t character is different from the author and blah blah blah, but if you caught yrself thinking about pointing out any of those things then i am afraid the large pole up yr ass is getting in the way of you understanding my point.]"

"event","hm.  i'm restless.  i want to be in a bar somewhere with an amaretto stone sour, a chip on my shoulder, and some righteous queercore playing in the background.  i want a handsome unfuckable face to talk postcolonial theory at me.  i want to be back in school.

i realize that each year i work retail i get stupider.  (""stupider""?  what the fuck kind of word is that?  proof, i tell you, that word is proof.)  i love my coworkers like family (and occasionally despise some as family, ha ha) but is that enough?  i spent last night combing the internet for sexuality/gender programs.  i found one that is a combination PsyD/MEd-- a doctorate in clinical psychology and a masters in education with an emphasis on sexuality and gender studies.  this seems to be the closest thing to what i imagine would prepare me for what i want to do.  

despite what my mother will tell you, this possible career choice is not just an excuse to surround myself with genderfucked folks who look good in eyeliner and a tie.  there's such a severe lack of mental health professionals with experience in queer issues.  hell, with abstinence-only sex ed programs the only ones that get funding, any sort of <b>sex</b> education is severely lacking.  i know too many people who've had their sexual orientation and/or gender expression conflated with their mental/emotional stability.  (i can still hear my therapist's advice when i told her i didn't want to have sex with my high school boyfriend, ""oh, you can't let the assault make you hate men... don't you want to be able to have pleasurable experiences with men?"")  

i was reading this book <u>transgender rights</u> and i almost had a heart attack because <b>judith butler contributed an article that does not require a degree in rhetoric to understand.</b>  really, all sentences are less than one page in length.  the article looks at the DSM diagnosis of gender identity disorder.  while homosexuality ceased to be a mental disorder in the 1970s, gender identity disorder persists (although it has been renamed and revised a bit).  on one hand, such a diagnosis does a disservice to those who don't fit neatly into hegemonic binary gender categories by pathologizing them-- and not even in a logical way.  (the diagnosis itself acknowledges the social construction of gender by allowing for cultural variations.)  however, at this time the only way to get hormones or surgery is with the recommendation of a therapist.  by utilizing the diagnosis of gender identity disorder, expensive procedures may be covered by medical insurance-- at least partially-- because they are treatment for the ""disease"".  i am not doing the article justice... butler includes discussion of some legal cases that illustrate how desperately the powers that be are working to naturalize and enfore categories of ""male"" and ""female"", often employing logic that is deeply flawed and prejudicial.  

am i babbling?  i think i am.  but see, see this passion?  i miss passion-- the intellectual kind.  i haven't had it for a while."

"event","my cats are ill.  i don't know what they have, but for the past 36 hours they have been shitting a storm.  i am thanksful that even in their protest against the litter box they have seen fit to limit their deposits to the basement.  i will make a vet appointment after my own therapy.  

the various sources i have consulted recommend taking away solid food for 24 hours, then feeding them chicken and rice in a 1:1 ratio.  i am going to see if i can find some oral syringes for water, because i don't want them to get dehydrated.

any advice is welcome."

Seriously, I have, see my eyes have been damaged my whole life, without correction I have never seen a nonblurry world.  But in close my eyes used to be sharp enough that I could pick out wood fibers in some papers.  So growing up the majority of the world was a big blurry blob, but in close it was fascinating.  I guess I learned to notice the little things from that and realize that those little things make something bigger.

So I have trouble when it comes to people that see things in the grand scale, without paying attention to the details that make it up. I guess they think that the final outcome outweighs what goes into it, but to me that makes no sense.  I mean we are what we eat and things that are built are built from something, if you put inferior materials in you'll get inferior results out.  In my mind that's just the way things work."

Now, a rant just in time for the holiday! This year is the US several major retailers are going to be open today. DO NOT GO SHOPPING AT THEM!! I don't care if it's your only day off, DO NOT GO.  I used to work retail and I recall that Thanksgiving was the day we looked forward to, it meant down time with the family and a chance to recharge the batteries before the madness.  Many a Thanksgiving I went to bed at 7 in the evening so I'd get the rest before having to be there at 3 am...which was bad enough.  They told us my last year of retail that we'd be open on Thanksgiving and the employees said ""No you won't cause you'll have no workers"" and it worked.  But enough is enough, this is the day for family, friends, and THANKS for surviving yet another year, you do NOT NEED TO GO SHOPPING TODAY.

Stay home and eat instead.  I'm off to church now so everyone have a Happy and Joyous Thanksgiving."

"event","I've had electric current zapped through my arms, been prodded with needles, had them twisted and turned and much more done to my arms in an effort to figure out what's going on with them.  On occasion they've gone numb, locked up, stiffened, and most mornings when I awake they don't work for a good 4 or 5 minutes til I've really shaken them a bit.  So, yippee more tests to come but they think it's in my head. Add to that the fact that the hospital whipped a 6 grand bill out for my emergency room stay after I apparently whipped myself down a flight of stairs back in June and you'll see why about 40% of my income goes right into keeping even a mediocre insurance working. I'm just letting y'all know in case you dropped by my art sites and wondered at the comments.

Not sure I'm going to go with WoW's Cataclysm, odds are I will just because that's where all the people I know are these days, but I really haven't been impressed with what I've seen.  AKA nothing in the beta has really made me go ""wow I really want to spend 40 bucks more on this.""  Don't get me wrong, there's a few neat new things, I really like the worgen opening chain, but my beloved druids have been beaten near to death with the nerf bat so much that I really don't even like playing the game any more.* (The Tree was me, and I was the tree, I never did want to have to shoot wrath from my fingers, I liked healing and was happy to do it.  Now to me it seems a worthless effort, and don't give me that crap of ""oh but they balanced it out by moving things up and down,"" because I've been at it for a few months now and I hate, I mean HATE the new healing mechanics.  Who the hell thinks a dps bonus needs to be right in the middle of the HEALING choices, sorry folks but it's stupid.  I get that they want to make the game NEW again, but heck half the stuff they did to dumb it down in Lich King is remaining but instead they're reworking how an entire class has to be played?**

Ok, enough of that rant.

I've also been amongst the missing because somehow a watch battery got into my computer's casing (no it wasn't in there, those batteries are all in place) and wedged near my hard drive and did quite the number on it.  Lost quite a bit of writings and lessons that I've yet to manage to fully recover.  But the comp has a new hd and a totally updated OS. (If you're going to have to rebuild might as well upgrade while you're at it.)

I'm working again on a semi regular basis, but even that has me wary...so we'll see what comes of it.  Y'all take care.



*Plus just playing the game can actually be painful, see paragraph one.

"event","But here I can say it, if he's actually responsible for the dumbest idea in the history of the 'net then GREG CANESSA IS AN IDIOT!!!! I'll scream it from freaking rooftops if I have to.  If he is responsible, then this guy's a nutter, he's in charge of Battle.net and recently gave an interview to USA Today. <a href=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2010/05/blizzard-and-facebooks-friendly-social-networking-deal-launches-with-starcraft-ii-/1>Huge Garbled URL to USAToday</A>

He basically said that privacy is a bunch of outdated crap and we need to get over it. However get this little bit in regards to possible negative player reaction to blending everything with crapolaonline, I mean Facebook:
""We don't anticipate any. We are going to be very clear and upfront with the user. Once they log in and create a Battle.net account for the first time, if they choose to participate in Real ID, it is of course, an optional set of features that you don't have to participate in. Beyond that we are going to notify them upfront their names could be used to populate via Facebook and how their names could be used via this Facebook feature.""
I think he called that one wrong with what's happening today.  They've got the worst idea ever. Their customer service and message forums will all be requiring you to post under your real name.  Yep, you heard it, real name, mandatory. In 12 hours they've gotten nearly 15000 posts in response, with about a thousand to one being NO.  Odds are they're still going ahead with this, and I won't post any more, which sucks because their customer service there could be a lot faster than in game at times.

I DO NOT WANT FACEBOOK!!  I DO NOT WANT MY REAL NAME AND ID ANYWHERE ON THE NET!!!  I HAVE MY REASONS FOR PRIVACY CONCERNS!! (And those of you that know me darned well why.) Blizzard has a history of doing this ""oh it's optional"" and then WHEN NO ONE WANTS IT says it's not optional anymore, everyone has to do it. If you play WoW and treasure your privacy, get your butt to that forum and scream as loudly as your typing fingers will let you, because you know if it isn't stopped now it will not end well.

For those that wish to take the message right to the top, the Board of Directors for Activison/Blizzard are listed at <a href=http://www.activisionblizzard.com/corp/ml/corpGovern/boardOfDirectors.html>http://www.activisionblizzard.com/corp/ml/corpGovern/boardOfDirectors.html</a>.  Even if you don't play let them know this is a really bad precedent being set.  Imagine your XBox Live Account suddenly being required to show your real name, or your posts at Ilovefluffyrats.com or whatever you might not want being publicly shown. We discuss a lot of things around here anonymously, though some of us know one another, there's still the veil we're shielded a bit by.  Imagine it being ripped away. Spread this info around as fast as you can and let's get this thing stopped fast.

Some people are already deleting accounts, I'm going to wait a few days and see what happens before I go that route."

"event","I have been a comic book reader for decades.  I say ""reader"" rather than ""collector"" because I really do open and read the stories and buy comics that I enjoy, not due to potential ""future value.""  Look there's stories in there folks, and some are actually worth reading.

Over the last 2 decades comics have been in a major funk.  <lj-cut text=""A continued discussion on comics and the new Avengers book, basically I like it."">Focusing on sales driver major events and mega huge crossovers.  This has sort of turned me off because I do not want to pick up a comic and have to buy 45 more comics to find out what happens in the next part of the story.  This having been said I usually ignore the major crossover tales in the main comics.  However, I got caught up in the current Siege storyline the Marvel's doing, even if it wrecked the really interesting stories Thor had going on. (Which is how I got drawn into the thing, Thor has been THE MAN in my book since the days when Walt Simonson fixed him up after the whole Thor fights vampires with his Holy Relic Symbol hammer thing...let's not go there, I was young.)  At first I was expecting a massive drawn out year long epic boring story with some dramatic climax where they kill off yet another major character.

I was right and wrong...I won't tell you how but it wasn't boring and a major character does die.  (Or do they? And I am not talking about the blond one, he's always been a second rater in my book.) This whole thing was to set up a so called ""new era of comics, the HEROIC AGE.""  Well, I was thinking this would be yet another do over and decided to give Avengers a chance.  Something I have not done since the time they whipped out Doctor Druid and Roger Stern basically bad mouthed my kid brother because he asked him to sign a copy of the Avengers he didn't write. (My brother, who never really has been in the best of health, see Heart Transplant Saga about 2 years back in this journal, was about 9 at the time and a huge Captain America fan, seeing Stern was one of the reasons he begged to go.)  We didn't know he'd been fired and the new issue was not by him, my brother just liked the stories, and give him credit he teaches literature now and still likes the Avengers.  Back on track rather than a rant about writers hating the people that like what they write, the Avengers.  I expected the new stuff to be junk, man was I surprised.

The story introduces familiar heroes and villains, brings them together and unleashes them on each other and even has a surprise mega villain in shadow (but obvious who it is) on the final panel.  I've never been a big fan of John Romita Jr's art*, but it's serviceable and in places imposing and grand on the scale the Avengers should be.  The story even left me with a surprised ""whoa"" on seeing the last panel.  A feeling I have not felt in years from a comic, especially since I figured out who the Red Hulk was ages ago. But I'm going to give them a chance to get me back over towards the ""hero"" books again and see if they actually do live up to the impressive pace they laid down in this issue.

Oh yeah, in the the really big throwback area I grabbed the First Issue of Zenoscope's Scifi & Fantasy Illustrated.  The cover just had the feel of the old pulps, so it drew me in.  I've yet to read it, or the Destiny's Hand Manga I picked up, we'll see how that goes.

* I've nothing against the guy, I really liked the Daredevil stuff, but the way he draws Thor, an eons old Viking Battle God, with a baby face in the issue just gets on my nerves.  It might be the inker or colorist's fault, but I'm blaming Romita since he had the same baby face in the Iron Man/Thor free comic book day issue. </lj-cut>"

Something kept drawing my attention to a certain patch of clover, there was something odd that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Then I realized it, there was a Four Leaf Clover right there in that patch.  I picked it and placed it safely away, the walkers still had not arrived.

Then, surprise surprise another nearby patch of clover had the same odd look and a second 4 Leaf Clover was there.  Then the walkers showed up and I got busy serving them and the rain sort of dampened further looking for clovers.  So, if one 4 Leaf Clover is good luck I am sure the second one somehow cancels it out and dooms me forever or something....

"event","<lj-cut text=""Just a rambling account of the last 2 months or so"">
It was probably June or July of last year since I posted a ""slice of life"" post rather than a rant or some silly meme, and I'm not sure if anyone is really interested but maybe one day I'll actually do something of worth and historians shall pour over this lj looking for insight and wisdom. (Ok, 3 minutes of hysterical laughter is enough, back to reading now.)

The last year has been pretty routine, I gained about 10 pounds over the holidays, ballooning up to 227, which I am now making the effort to take off.  Having lost 3 pounds in the last 10 days or so by merely cutting out soda and doing a little bit more exercise.  I also hope it'll help in dealing with the apnea, which the machine has done wonders with.  While my ears still ring and I have occasional aches and pains, I no longer feel like I was beaten with a baseball bat while I slept, nor am I having narcoleptic attacks anymore, so that's good.  

I've also gone bearded, shaving a much smaller section and only to shape up the beard.  It helps balance out the rapidly retreating hairline which has gone on a full scale retreat (even more than it was) in the last year.

On the work front I've been subbing and tutoring on a regular basis but have yet to find full time work and the tutoring will run out probably about the first week of April, after having gotten a majorly late start due to a state budget fight. So now I need to start looking for something to make a summer income, the census thing is going on and I will probably look at that for a temporary fix.  I'm still applying for full time teaching, but apparently still don't hit the right qualifications those doing the hiring  are seeking.  I'm also doing the online coursework thing to maintain my certification and keep my skills sharp.

On the relationship thing, SWMMTOTT is still putting up with me, for now, despite having only seen me for a week back in Dec/Jan. The lady continues to amaze me by putting up with me this long and deserves kudos for not running off screaming and informing me I'm a total waste of time.  That and the hotel had a bedbug issue, but apparently don't like my taste.

As for <a href=""http://www.side7.com/gallery.cgim?member=shishiosa"">artwork?</a>  Well, there really hasn't been anything,  I've had a few story ideas I toyed around with and some sketch ideas that really didn't amount to anything, but one involved Woot of EOI taking on an old god from WoW.  Apparently me having the mere concept of going anywhere near fan art of his creations was enough to bring the long hibernating <a href=""http://sortelli.livejournal.com/"">Sortelli</a> back to post at his lj. If I do go ahead and complete it I'll most likely put it up over on the <a href=""http://annammu.deviantart.com/"">ANNAMMU Deviant Art account.</a> Maybe I need to threaten drawing one of <a href=""http://www.nagasden.com/"">Naga's characters</a> next.

I'm also laying out plans to build an outdoor stone oven later this year, merely because when I was <a href=""http://www.pumpnpantry.com/"">making pizzas 2 years ago</a> I really disliked the way they came out and want to prove it can be done better than that terrible metal box thing that almost everyone makes.  I'll try to keep pictures posted when it gets underway and the layers of snow and ice turn to green.

In my time wasting division of WoW play I've actually leveled a <a href=""http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Exodar&cn=Maclean"">second av to 80</a> and discovered that, to paraphrase Barbie's opinion of math, tanking is hard.  Especially as a warrior, they don't have any where near the insane amount of hp that a paladin does after buffing nor do they have any healing ability at all.

I also need to get my butt in gear and update my <a href=""http://www.shelfari.com/o1517854802"">shelfari account</a> too.

That's it for me for now.  May you be a little informed and afraid of what is going on.

"event","The 102 degree fever last night really tipped me off, but I realized today that I seem to get pretty emotional with movies when I get sick.  I've been lying here watching movies and really not moving much and I have been in tears at every corny sappy ending, not usual for me but it seems to happen a lot more when I get sick.  I wonder if the emotional sappiness combines with the pain to overwhelm my resistance or what.

I've been up for the last four hours but considering I was about comatose for a good 12 of the last 18 isn't too bad.

And in case you were interested it was Wall-E  and The Last Starfighter, which looks REALLY good in HD even if the computer generated effects are a bit dated.  So yes I am a big cornball."

"event","There are some small joys to living in Pennsylvania.  One of them is getting to try out some Hershey Goodness long before the rest of the country.  Today I had the joy of trying out a Reese's DARK Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup, and they're apparently shipping these things out fast for Halloween and I haven't been to that store in a month so you might have them already.  It's delicious I highly recommend them for your appetite cravings.

Also I was a bit surprised to find out that Ray Bradbury was a close friend of Charles Addams, who even illustrated some of his stories (I have got to find a few of those to see) and whom he even helped create the Addams Family*....the things I learn when putting together lessons at high speed while subbing.

And oh yeah, apparently the phones are out in the whole area, which in my home means it's some how my fault,  one day I will figure out this God like ability I apparently have that everything bad is my fault but at least the dsl still works.

*Halloween draws near, those who know me know more Addamsy goodness will be mentioned...."

<lj-cut text=""What follows are images and my anger at GM's stupidity"">

<img src=""http://media.nextautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/gm-chevy-volt-lutz-intro.jpg"" />

In my opinion an impressive looking car, looks lean and mean, in other words everything a car should look like.  Not like the annoying happy, bubbly look of the Prius or the Insight, which is fine if you like that sort of thing and I don't.

Now, the production version of the Volt:


<img src=""http://www.blogcdn.com/www.autobloggreen.com/media/2008/10/production-volt.jpg"" />

It makes me want to cry. It's a modified Lumina!!!  Gone is the lean and hungry look, replaced with sweet and cutesy curves and a ""friendly"" look.

Now personally I don't give a flip about the whole ""environmentally friendly cars"" thing because in my opinion those massive batteries loaded with acid or whatever are going to be tons worse in waste than the exhaust of a car, but hey if I go from 40 bucks a tank to 4 bucks to charge up you've got my attention.

There's allegedly a more <a href=""http://jalopnik.com/5128642/cadillac-converj-concept-a-volt-for-cadillac"">sporty Cadillac version of the Volt, the Converj (what a stupid name)</a> in the works, and again the concept car looks cool, but place your bets on how crappy the real deal will look if it ever hits the streets. They've already toned it down from the concept drawings, gone are the scissor doors and the spoiler.

"event","Yes, I went and saw ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" yesterday.  I've let it rumble around and settle a bit in my head before I said anything about it, because the ending does just what is intended and messes with the emotions a bit.

I went to the 1pm showing at the newest theater in the area and was surprised that it was half full HALF AN HOUR before the movie started.  Not a whole lot more came in, apparently those wishing to see the Potter movie came prepared. The theater itself was gorgeous, large screen, spacious seats and THEY RECLINE!!! The arm rest however do not fold up so I could not make a couch and nap in the half hour before the movie started. 

Ok, now for the moive, I know the it has a run time of 2 hours and 33 minutes, but the whole thing feels rushed.  Like someone whipped through the book in half an hour and stole the scenes that stuck in their heads. Apparently the person who did so was feeling a bit amorous as we're stuck with an awful lot of google eyed teenagers in puppy love moments.  Knowing how everything is going to wind up in the end does make some of the moments more amusing, but not enough to save this full throttle dash.  Oh yes, there's a serious effort to make sure Draco Malfoy is in every scene looking morose and depressed, and a lot of you know why.  The whole Half Blood Prince focus is heavily pushed at the start and then just sort of abandoned and we end up with a bunch of cheesy Gollum ripoffs in a cave, and apparently the bulk of the movie's special effects budget.

Then comes the end.  Well if you read the books you know what happens at the end of this one, it's a big deal.  And since Alan Rickman is very involved in the scene I couldn't help but recall ""Die Hard"" after all it's practically the exact same shot and effect.

My cheapskate review?  Well, yeah this one was worth the six dollar matinee admission price, but I'd have been a bit disgruntled at 10.  (Like I was disgusted with Transformers 2, but we won't go there.)"

"event","Ok, Seso posted about Zelda and the Octopus or whatever it is being the best video game ever.  I dispute this fact, as I am an antique and was alive and spending quarters madly in the glorious Golden Age of video games.  I remember when there was a quarter eater in EVERY business (there was Pac-Man and Asteroids when it started in the Grocery Store, and the Gas Station had some weird ones they rotated every month, but it was there I was labeled a ""space cadet"" by the demonic GORF, and the restaurant was heaven with 3 different machines and 2, count em 2, pinball machines. And of course there was the arcade which had piles of things to take away those 25 cent pieces.)

And of course, there was the Atari.  The machine that brought that all home....sort of.  I don't think the marketing guys back then quite got what made the video games appealing and then they came up with some really off beat ads.  I myself reveled in the fact that I was one of the few with a genuine Atari 2600 and not the Sears Telegames 2 knockoff almost everyone else had in the area.  That meant I got Combat as my game and not that weird bombing thing that came with the Sears one.  In fact I still have my Atari, with the suit case of games, (most of which were purchased after the fall and they sold for 97 cents.) I haven't played it in probably 18 years but I'm betting it still works.

I should haul that thing out and record some game play and torment you all with the glory days.  But since that would take way too much effort on my behalf I will simply allow you to bask in the dim light of what was the commercial for Yar's Revenge and the 1978 Atari System ad...if only you could have been alive then kids.  (And if you were, bask with me in those memories of yesteryear when Americans actually could make electronics.)

"event","Years ago it was Comcast seizing TechTV to turn it into whatever disaster it's called these days.  Now the idiots at NBC have decided to rebrand the SciFi Channel as SyFy, all in the interest of having a trademarkable logo. It really hasn't been SciFi for a long time, pro wrestling while being pretty fictional still doesn't quite match the SciFi credentials 

They got cable and turned it from the fun loving and innovative place it was where you watched what you wanted based on the channel, ie ""The Weather Channel"" was actually where you went to watch the weather, Music Television played music, and heaven forbid that the Cartoon Network actually had Cartoons.

We seem to have shifted into an era where everyone's an idiot and screams ""we need to increase market share and show something other than what made us successful!!"" The scary thing is that some moron above them actually listens.  Look Billionaire Ted and I might not agree on a lot of things, but he was willing to have fun, I mean can you imagine TBS running Barbarella all day on Jane Fonda's birthday now? Nope, ain;t going to happen as we'd have some nitwit with a spread sheet screaming that we can get 2.1% more viewers by having it compressed from 90 minutes to 30 seconds, hack of the credits and start the next show before the old one ends and make sure to run commercials over the bottom.

And then these morons actually wonder why they're loosing viewers? I say, put the MUSIC BACK ON MTV, THE WEATHER BACK ON THE WEATHER CHANNEL, CARTOONS ON CARTOON NETWORK, AND SCIFI BACK ON SCIFI (note I said SciFi, not SyFy, if they really want a SyFy channel, go ahead and put whatever the heck you want on it, me I have visions of Teletubbies, Wuzzles, Popples, and other cuddly cute things running around under that name.)  President Obama is busy running around slapping Czars in charge of everything, I nominate myself as Television Czar, I ask you to take up this plea and I promise to do my best to get things back as they should be in the mind numbing genre of television programming and to get the megacorps to behave in regards to entertainment.

And may God help us all, these are the same megacorps that are greedily eying the internet these days. (Though that whole AOL-TimeWarner thing sort of bombed didn't it.)"

You better get in touch with the admin and tell them to check their email fast before I get the lawyers in on this act.

Nor do I think the artisans that crafted the images all over that site will be thrilled about the theft and use of their works.


(If you want to know what has me mad, hit ""Summons""  hope your browser doesn't crash, and then hit the Cedu Isv'a or however the heck they spell it.  You'll find Shishi, Alizara, and Yao Chi prominently on display with hijacked NCD art.

Now I've been carefully thinking, I can think of maybe two people* that may have asked permission and if it's either one of them there will be no legal action, just a discussion about what is really wrong with this.  However I really am not thrilled about this.

Funny what's still out there on the 'net, Owlhaven had a storytelling contest way back in May of 1999, and my love of rhyming came out even then....

Twas once a tiger in the night
that cowered all with its fierce might
Once while prowling by force of habit
By the river bank it came upon a lowly rabbit
""Please don't eat me"" the Rabbit said""
(Which was what exactly was in the tiger's
head!)
At this request the Tiger grinned
as the poor bunny's hopes dramatically
dimmed
Frantically the rabbit did think
As the Tiger prepared his teeth to sink
Quickly the rabbit found a rock
with which the tiger's teeth he'd block
Down the Tiger's teeth did gnash
upon the rock with a resounding smash
When it was through the tiger was no more
and the world's first carnivore bunny
stood upon the shore
And thus the moral I do bequeath
""Watch just where you put your teeth.""


Yeah I wrote that, made it up as I went along...I need some sort of additional medical help don't I  ;) 

Maybe I should finish my ""Ode to the Hatred of Gnomes"" someday."

"event","Ya, so I get it from everyone. Why do I waste time with men? They have no respect for what you do for them or for everyone else.

Jason has been more distant than usual. Drinking more than usual. Yet, he bitches at me for being distant. Also found out he's trying to meet girls on the net now... nice. He's gonna fuck up and he's gonna see what it feels like to REALLY get fucked over. He think's he's gonna cheat on me? Please... I'm too smart. He's gonna get fucked and not like he wants. 

I'm so done. With everything. With life in general. I give up. Everything sucks for me. It always does. I'm no better off than I was 2 years ago. He even used the photo I took of him on his profile to try to get chicks. I think I'm gonna throw up."

 I'm not sure at what point things changed but some how, some way they did. I'm not really sure if it's bad or good. It feels like both. It hurts and feels amazing at the same time. I think about him all the time. I miss him when we're not talking. I miss him when I can't see him. I feel guilty when I try NOT to think about him. I feel like crying when I really think about how far away he is.... or when I hear him say he loves me. This is all so unexpected.. or is it? It's been such a long time.. It's been nearly 6 years since I met him. Things are bound to change one way or another. 

For him and him alone:

  I love you. As a friend. As more.. maybe I'm falling in love with you if that's possible. Is it? Considering all things in this situation, is it possible to let myself fall in love with someone? I mean, this situation isn't normal. And it's not something I would normally do or be open to with anyone else. It wasn't even a thought in my mind.
  You're the only person I've been able to ""let in"". You make me want to fix my faults.. be a better person, so that you'll be proud. You make me want to swallow my pride and open myself up.. even if it means getting hurt. 
  I'm not sure where this is all going, if anywhere. It's possible that this is the end as well as the beginning. It may never get any farther. But then again, the possibilities are endless. Love has no boundaries. If we want something enough, we just have to make it happen. I don't know.. I'm just thinking out loud lol 
  It feels good to tell you how I feel about you. I've always felt something for you... but yesterday, i looked at you and it was so much deeper than I ever noticed before.
  Ok.. I've said enough. It's probably not that much.. but for me, it's a LOT.

  I love you."

"event","Ok hun... here it is, a brand new journal. It's probably better you don't read the old one lol Scary stuff. 

Today I'm just kind of hanging in there.. by the skin of my teeth, but I'm hangin. Trust.. it's a hard thing to regain once it's lost. Why does it get lost? Many reasons I suppose but for me it was because of accusations. I've always felt that the guilty hand points the finger. After so many months of getting pointed at I finally started getting suspicious. Now, there's no trust. He says he trusts me but I still get questioned so much. I don't trust him. I think he fucked around in the beginning. I'll never know for sure. We need to split up or fix it. It's gonna take some long term couple's counseling or something. I love him. I can't imagine being with someone else.. but sometimes, he makes me want to hurt him. Physically. Emotionally. Anyway I can. And I do.

Anyway... fun first entry huh? Here we go... at least THIS journal isn't all about my extremely sexual adventures LOL You have to read the old journal for that!

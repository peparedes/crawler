"event","I'm unsure of what to do with this journal.&nbsp; This was where I would come and write out my sexual fantasies and frustrations and things of that nature.&nbsp; I'm no longer with my husband, and it was with him that I had all these frustrations.&nbsp; I now have an amazing boyfriend, and really have no need to come here and vent or express any fantasies.&nbsp; I'm very, very happy, sexually (and in all other aspects), so what is to become of this journal?&nbsp; I do visit here time to time to peek in on some of the communities I've joined, but other than that I have no use for this journal.&nbsp; I don't think anyone reads this, anyway.&nbsp; 

So, what to do?&nbsp; Delete it?&nbsp; Try to find some other use for it?&nbsp; Or, just let it sit idle and use it just for communities?"

"event","I'm at a bar, just hanging out, having a good time, and who should walk in? J and his girlfriend.  I go over, say hello, get introduced to his girlfriend.  Tell her it's great to meet her, buy them their drinks and make small chit-chat for a while.  J is nervous as hell.  I can see his body is all tensed up.  Will I slip up?  Will she sense our feelings for each other?  He is so sweating this situation.  I find delight in his anguish in a sick, twisted way.  I take my leave and return to watching a few of my friends play pool.<br /><br />After a few minutes J comes over to the pool table and places his quarter to mark his turn.  His girlfriend is coming over as well.  J asks me if I would like to play a partners game with him and his girlfriend.  I tell him I suck at pool, and that I wouldn't wish me as a partner on my worst enemy.  His girlfriend admits that she's horrible, too, but will I play just one game with them.  She tells me that they have an agreement that she has to play just one game with him and then she lets him play all he wants after that.  I agree, and ask my hottest guy friend to be my partner.  I want to see J sweat a little more.<br /><br />Now it's our turn at the table.  Since I am absolute shit at this game, I need lots of help from my sexy partner.  Showing me which balls to sink where, getting behind me to help me line up the shot.  J wishes it were him.  His body pressed against mine.  I wish it were him, too.  Oh, the things I would do on this pool table to him right now.  J tries not to look at me, with another man touching me.  I see the desire in his eyes.  He's trying to conceal it, his girlfriend is here after all, but I can see it.  And I can tell he's very nervous now about her catching on.  I love the tension that's been created, even a little turned on by it.  When did I like being so evil?<br /><br />
<div text=""Continued..."" class=""ljcut"">The game ends.  I lost.  J plays the next game without his girlfriend.  I refresh my drink and join her at the bar.  We start talking about the usual things.  How's work?  Doesn't this weather suck?  Blah, blah, blah.  Then she asks about my husband.  <br />""Where's he at tonight?""  <br />""At home, I'm out by myself.""<br />""He let's you go out alone?""<br />""No, he doesn't let me.  I go out when I want, and if he doesn't want to go with me, he doesn't"".  <br />""Doesn't he worry about you being out at a bar with all these guys?""<br />""He doesn't think about me much these days, it seems.""<br />""Why's that?"" she asks.<br />""Oh,"" I explain, ""we've just turned more into roommates than husband and wife lately.""<br />""What do you mean?""<br />""Well, we don't sleep together anymore.  He's been sleeping on the couch for about a year.  And that's his choice, not because I make him or anything.  Over the last two years, we've only been having sex only about every three months.  And even then, it's not that great.  It's just sex.  Just, insert, repeat until finished.  No foreplay, no caresses.  No passion.  It's sex just to have sex, because masturbation can only hold you over so long.""<br /><br />Her eyes widen when I say the word masturbation.<br /><br />""Do you really masturbate?"" she asks with a kind of nervous laugh.<br />""Of course a girl's got to, especially in my situation""<br /><br />""What situation?""  J's game is over and has returned for another drink before he plays again.<br />""Oh, nothing.  Just girl talk."" his girlfriend says.  ""We're talking about how all you men suck and how much we hate you.  Now go back to playing pool and leave us alone.""  She gives him a quick kiss to let him know she's kidding and he looks at me in that insant.  I see nervousness in his eyes.  I really am enjoying his agony.<br /><br />J's girlfriend and I get back to talking.  She confides in me that she has never really masturbated.  Oh, she'd touched herself a few times, but never really to the point of getting herself off.  She wishes she could because J has told her that he would like to watch her pleasure herself (which is something he told me he would like to watch me do, but unlike her, I'm all too happy to oblige that desire).  She worries that she's just not making him happy sexually.  I love this topic of conversation.  I urge her on, asking all about their sex life.  She tells me that he's been asking for things the last few months.  Things that they don't normally do, but things that he's wanted for some time now.  He wants more foreplay, he wants to go down on her (which she doesn't like), he wants to try new things, new places (she's a in the bedroom, lights off type of girl).  She wants to make him happy, but that the things he's asking her to do are just too much for her to handle.<br /><br />Oh, the predicament I'm in. I want to tell her, ""Well honey, it sounds like you just can't please your man, so you should just give him over to me""  or maybe even having her watch while I fulfill his every desire, that could be fun.  Or watching them with each other while I insruct her.  My mind is racing with possibilities.<br /><br />I settle on asking her why she doesn't like these doing things.<br /><br />""Well,"" she says, ""I guess I've never really done that kind of stuff and I'm just not confident about my performance.""<br /><br />""Why don't you just try masturbating.  You know, practice makes perfect.""<br /><br />""I can't do that.  I just feel weird about it.""<br /><br />""What about having J masturbate you?  Like, have him hold your hand and he controls your hand but it's still you touching yourself.  Do you think you could do that?""<br /><br />""I guess.  I don't know.  It just seems weird doing that in front of him""<br /><br />I sigh.  Why is this girl so hung up about this shit?  If that is what J wants, then she needs to get over her issues and give it too him.<br /><br />I order more drinks, (even though I'm very drunk already), and we continue to talk about sex.  Then, I notice that my ride home is no longer in the bar.<br /><br />""Hey, where did T go?"", I ask K behind the bar.<br /><br />""Left with some girl.""<br /><br />""Shit.""<br /><br />""What's wrong?"" J's girlfriend asks me.<br /><br />""My ride has ditched me.  Looks like I'll be calling a cab""<br /><br />Her eyes squint a little and her mouth puckers up like she's thinking about something.<br /><br />""Well, J and I can take you home.""<br /><br />""No, that's okay.  I'm not sure how late I'm staying out and I don't want to make you guys either cut your night short or stay out too late.  But, thanks.  I'll be alright.""<br /><br />J comes back over to us, happy and exited.  He's been kicking ass at pool all night.  He orders all of us a round of shots.  His girlfriend tells him about my ride ditching me.<br /><br />""We can take you home, it's no problem.""<br /><br />""No, I don't want to intrude on your evening.  You guys don't have to worry about taking me home.""<br /><br />""You sure?""  There is real concern in J's eyes, so tender and sweet, and it makes me want to kiss him right now, right there.  <br /><br />I settle on touching his arm and saying, ""Yes, I'm sure.  Thanks for the shot.""<br /><br />We all down our shots and J goes back over to the pool table.  His girlfriend looks at me with a bold, brazen look on her face.<br /><br />""How about coming home with us?""<br /><br />""What?"" I ask, shocked.<br /><br />""Come home with us.  Show me.  Show me these things you've been telling me to do.  For some reason I just feel so comfortable talking to you about sex, but I can never seem to talk with J about it.  I think I'd feel comfortable if you were there with me.  Please don't think that I'm weird or a lesbian or anything like that.  I just, I just...""<br /><br />Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.  She did not just ask that, did she?<br /><br />""Are you sure you know what you're asking for?  I mean, are you sure it's not just the alcohol affecting your judgement?  Are you really sure you want this?""<br /><br />""I'm sorry.  I know I must be coming off as crazy, but I, I want to make J happy.  I just don't know how.  I'm sorry I asked you that.  You probably think I'm a freak or something now.""<br /><br />""No, I don't think that.  I just want to make sure you fully realize what you're asking for.  What are your conditions.""<br /><br />She looks at me shocked, and curious.<br /><br />""Conditions?""<br /><br />""Conditions.  Are you and I just gonna have an 'educational experiment' while J watches TV?  Will he be involved in any way?  What do you want?""<br /><br />""Oh.  I guess we could...""<br /><br />""Don't guess, tell me what it is YOU want.""<br /><br />She takes a deep breath, gathering courage.<br /><br />""Well, I want you to do what you said earlier, you know have J hold my hand to masturbate me.  But I want you to do it.  Is that weird?""<br /><br />""Not at all.  And I would love to do that for you.  Now, what about J?""<br /><br />Now I take a deep breath.  I still cannot believe this is happening.<br /><br />""He can watch.  He's told me he's wanted to watch me masturbate, so in a way he's getting what he wants, right?""<br /><br />""Oh yes, and then some,"" I laugh.  ""But he'll probably want to do more than just watch after a while.  Do you want me to leave after that or do you want me to stay?""<br /><br />She ponders for a moment.  ""Stay.  But I want J to only touch me.  I don't think I could handle seeing him touch another woman.""<br /><br />""You mean me.""<br /><br />""Oh, I didn't mean...""<br /><br />""It's okay, I know what you're saying.  I'm fine with that.  Now, what do you say we ask J if he's okay with your little plan.""<br /><br />""What little plan?"" J asks.<br /><br />I laugh, ""Speak of the devil.""<br /><br />""Well, I.."" his girlfriend stammers, ""I thought that maybe..""<br /><br />As she's trying to come with words, J is looking at me.  I want him so badly.  It's not enough for me.  Her invitation is not enough for me.  I want his hands on me.  I want his mouth on me.  But, I'll accept, because I'll do anything just to be near him.<br /><br />""I've invited her over to our place,"" she finally manages to say.<br /><br />""Oh, when?""<br /><br />""Tonight.""<br /><br />J almost chokes on the beer he just drank.<br /><br />""What do you mean, tonight?""<br /><br />As she explains the situation to J, I pay both our tabs.  I have a feeling we're leaving real soon.  I turn back to the two of them.  J is absolutely shocked.  I am absolutely elated.<br /><br />We leave the bar, drive back to their place.  I cannot believe the opportunity that has presented itself to me tonight.  And yes, I'm married, but my husband has told me that I can show off my body to anyone (he was thinking more along the lines of flashing people) and he has said that I can fool around with women all I want (thinking I would never do that) so I'm really only doing that which he has stated he's comfortable with.  Before I know it, I'm in their house.  She seems a little nervous now, the effects of the alcohol wearing off.  J seems anxious, but trying to keep it in check.  He doesn't want to screw this up by being pushy.  He'll have to sit back and let us take control.<br /><br />I suggest a shot of something before we start (more courage for her), and ask her where she would like to do this.  We go to the bedroom, take a shot of vodka, and I ask, ""How would you like to start?""<br /><br />""I don't know,"" she says, ""I've never done anything like this before.""  She's being shy now, nervous.  I see I'm going to have to take over.<br /><br />""Let me undress you.""<br /><br />And before she can say anything, I walk over to her and kiss her.  She's suprised at first, but reciprocates.  I've kissed a woman once before, and what I remember of that is the same here.  Her lips are soft and moist and the kiss is so tender.  Like a gentle caress.<br /><br />I undo her blouse as we kiss and begin to rub her breasts.  She gasps.  I kiss her harder.  I slide her blouse off her arms and start on her pants.  I undo the button and zipper and pull them down just a little.  I break away from our kiss and ask her to take off her shoes and pants.  As she does, I glance at J.  He is standing there, visibly aroused.  Our eyes meet, and I realize that this is going to be all there is for us.  I will never be able to have sex with this man that I have wanted, but I can give him this.  This will be giving him something he wants, and his relationship with his girlfriend will become stronger, better for both of them.  This is all I can give him and I will never have him.  I smile, and hope he understands.<br /><br />She's sitting on the edge of the bed in her bra and panties, waiting for whatever came next.  I straddle her and kiss her again, easing her down onto the bed.&nbsp; I move down to her neck, kissing her slowly and passionately, inhaling the scent of her perfume.<br /></div>"

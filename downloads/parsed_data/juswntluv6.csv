I swear deep down in my heart I don't feel like a very bad person but it seems that bad things continue to happen to me. Especially when it comes to ""love"". In every relationship I have ever had I have tried my best to be the best in it, but all I seem to get is these half-stepping ass niggaz.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc66cc>I mean I thought @ one pt dating a older guy was good, because he seemed a whole lot more mature than most guys I've dated. I thought cheating was kinda the only thing that could be done wrong in a relationship but I was sooooo wrong, there so many other problems you could have in a relationship. I mean I never thought money be a problem because money is not as important to me than having someone to love unconditonally. And as I look back on my past relationships I've found one problem they all had in common, it was ""not putting me first"" as I did them. I n a relationship your spouse she be number one in your life. And I realized that's what's missing in my life, being number to someone. I mean Lenny hasn't cheated to my knowledge and really don't think he has. But him being gone for two months and some change seems to be unacceptable in my book. Because its something that keeps bothering me. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc66cc>I know I very dependent on my ""love"" but for someone who says they want to spend the rest of their life you. Why can't I be dependent? I never ask for money all I ever ask for is time, is that so wrong? Lenny is the best guy I have ever dated but the one bump in the road is tearing me apart inside. I mean I've learned a lot about myself since he has been gone but, Im not sure if things will ever be the same between us. He's coming back this weekend and I don't know if I can't let him back my heart again.....</FONT></EM></P>"

Lenny claims he's gonna get me away from here but I don't think it will be quick enough for me.  Hopefully I get this job I wanted. Then it will be smooth sailing from there. Some comments my mothers say just pisses me the fuck off, they are so fucking childish and just aren't necessary. I found out it will be like 200 dollars to get my car insurance which is pissing me off because its just too much.  But that's what I get for being lazy and not doing drivers ed a long time ago.

Dee has been on my mind lately....and I don't know if its exactly bad or good.  But I've been thinking maybe I should have choosen him.  Not because LB is bad or anything, cause he's actually perfect, and too perfect and can drive you crazy. There are things he does that makes me think like, I would have liked it better if Dee did it. I miss him a little bit.  But he's just not the same person I loved at one point.  I feel as though I don't even know him anymore.... I wish god could give me a sign on what I should do.... I tried calling him, to see if that could help me....but he wasn't there. He called me the other day but I wasn't home and I left my phone upstairs....so I didn't get to it. I couldn't talk to him anyways I was with Lenny. I feel like me and Lenny are not gonna move....like we are stuck right here.  I mean as far as growing in life...as far a future goes.

One thing I loved about Dee is that if he wanted something to happen he could make it happen....that's how much faith I had in him.  That's why I know he really didn't want to be with me....because if he did he would have made it happen....I don't feel like he really tried. I feel he just did because he thought it might have been the right thing to do at the time. Right now I know he's living life, what I should be doing, but I don't know how to."

I mean even when he had no obligation to be as intimacy goes but&nbsp; he lied anyway even when all I wanted was his friendship but he could never handle that.&nbsp; Then when he popped talking about he wanted to go Virgina my first gut instincts was NO....what reason could possibly give to move with anywhere, you've treated like shyt for over 7 or 8 months now....He has/had the chance to prove him, self, but obiviously he doesn't love that much....because if he really wanted to be with me....he would be with me....But I'm hoping everything works out for everyone I know....because all that I've been through I wouldn't wish on anyone.</FONT></EM></P>"

So I was like so you ain't a pimp and he was like I guess not then.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's driving all slow cause he though I was cold and I told him I wasn't but newayz he took me to Harris Teeter to get some medicine for my mom before he dropped me off which was ok...Then we got to my house and we chilled for like 10 or 12 mins in the car.....just talking/ plus I was waiting on a&nbsp;kiss (lol yall kno I love 2 kiss right?) but newayz we were just talking about how much we like each other and what not and then I touched his hand and he was like why you do that and I was like because I wanted to and he was like oh and I opened the door and I mumbled that wasn't all I wanted and he was like what do you want and I was like a kiss so he gave me one (not a peck) but then I said ok bye and started to get out the car and he was like can I get another one and I was like why didn't you say that </EM></FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#ffcccc size=4><EM>before I got out of the car and he was like, I like to play a lot...so I got back in and we kissed for about 3 mins. I'm not gonna front I like it and I said let me go.&nbsp; So as I was walking to the door he was like I'm gonna cry I was like ok.... So he said he was gonna call me when he got back to his brothers house and I was like ok....he called back in like 12 mins and that was fast for someone who lives off of Santa Fe' but ne wayz so oh yeah! He called me and was like do you know who this is? I was like yeah Lenny and he was like its your boyfriend LB. And I was blushing for like the next 15mins or so.&nbsp; Then we talked about how we both liked the kiss. I think I'm seriously lusting for him, but I have to play it cool for a little while longer because I might be getting in deeper than needed right now.</EM></FONT></P>"

Lenny seems like that type of person who can give me that&nbsp;""thug love"" that I love so much.&nbsp;He is such a cool person he helps me get my mind of a certain (D) someone, which is great not to many can do that. There was only one other person who did that and I still love him as a person. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#996633 size=4>Well my sister hooked me up with this boy named Mario which I still haven't seen yet even though everyone including my niece said was cute, they said ""He's dark skin about 5'9 about 160lbs, all gold teeth (ill), tattoo's all over"" everything but them damn gold teeth sound straight...we've been talking on the phone ever since Saturday night when I got off of work. He seems like cool peoples, but I wonder where this is going to go.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#996633 size=4>Who do I like better Mario or Lenny?

<P><FONT color=#339999 size=4>My mother has just pissed me off once again, I don't care if she is my mother fucking mother I still don't believe she had the right to say what she just said to me...I'm meeting again with my recruiter monday and make it official cause this shyt is aggravating the hell out of me. I feel as if I can't grow as a person here, I need to get away all this stress is bad for my health cause he has is making me smoke shyt if I didn't have that damn nicotine to calm me down, shyt would escalate uncontrably into a worse situation. I talked to Lennie he calmned me down, I'm not quite ready to start talking to him about my problems shyt neither was I with Dee and I've known him forever aint that funny? well nothing really serious anyways I just don't tell him about that stuff. But I'm gonna go on this trip because I want to spend time with my family and also it depends on what shakila thinks.&nbsp; I don't know if I'm going on this GA trip I need to save up my money so I can get the FUCK up out of here. Just when I was start to open my eyes my mom (symbolically) pokes me in the eye which brings me back to square one...she's so fucking closed minded its either her way or the highway... I was gonna drop the whole situation after she said she wasn't gonna change her mind but when I get home she starts bitching....but wutever.&nbsp;Well I guess if I ain't stressing about shyt at home it has to be school I knew there was a reason why school has been so unstressful actually between work and school give me time away from her ass. Someone who also used to get my mind off of the negative things was James, I think that's why I never wanted him to leave he was such a positive impact on me at one pt and time....I hope he's happy with his life, I never wanted any negative to happen to him, he so sweet when he wanted to be, so many small memories. Oh, yall are wondering like where the fuck did James come from, I'm just listening to this song he had me listening to one time that's all. He hipped me up to a lot of songs....this was when he was trying to describe how he felt about me at one pt and time. Also when I&nbsp; hope my mother enjoys her life with fucking Luke and Chrishana cause she so close to them to and fuck everybody else. That's one thing me and medina feel on that.&nbsp;But whatever, this is one messed up family, but what family isn't? I need a big hug right now, because I'm so scared of what my future is gonna be, because I'm clueless I just hope everything works out for the best.</FONT></P>"

And its not necessarily holding a grudge, its actually being real with you ain't no sense in fronting like things were gonna be ""personally"".  I mean unlike you I don't come fake with it.  Because you actually were fake with right along with me expecting us to become back cool or wutever, so please stop ""frontin'"".But wutever. So please again, stop ""frontin'"".  But its wutever with it all. I just hope you read the whole journal.


But anyways yesterday was pretty good day in all.  I mean I went to clinicals that morning and it was ok... Anyways that day I chilled with my friend Kim and we went to her house so I could see her mom, sisters, and brother...haven't seen them in a while.  Then we went to the mall and walked around and what not.  Then I had to go to work....and around 7:30 or so Shakila tail show up actin a fool...but I needed to see her to cheer me up a little cause these people who couldn't speak english kept coming up in KFC while I'm at the cash register.

Then when I got home I started talking on the phone with D and he was on that non-sense and he pissed me off a little...just when my day was getting good or wutever.  But I just shook it off, when he tried to call back I just didn't answer...no need in making things worse...ya feel me.  Then D friend Josh called me and was tryin to talk to me about the situation...the only reason Dee is even caring cause he thinks I coming down there to see him, which I'm not. I'm through with doing all the work in the relationship, especially when I never done anything wrong in it to begin with.  Then I got off with them around 12:30 and went to sleep."

But newayz....as everyone knows yesterday was St. Patricks Day, I completely forgot about it...but newayz TD pinch me once which was expectable but then the second time it really hurt and on top of it I wasn't in the mood so whatever I let it go...but me being mad at Q always runnin his mouth...I got some tea on him and it also got on TD but actually I got more on her than I did him, which wasn't my intentions at all. But newayz so she attempts at first to put her drink on me which I was like stop...I didn't get you on purpose...but as I start to walk up the stairs and then she get me which wasn't cool seeing as I didn't even get her that much...So she knew I was gonna get her thats why she ran so I chased her...because that wasn't cool at all. So I guess she thought I wasn't gonna go in the class room but what a surprise I just planned to get her on her back pack or wutever but she turned around and I think I got her on her face/chest or wutever and I dropped my bottle and started to walk out next thing I know this bitch ass pussy grabs me by my hair. So I'm like what the fuck....So I guess that's when we started fighting or wutever...this bitch had a good hold on my hair I give her that.  As a matter a fact I thought I was gonna have a bald spot but I can't tell where all that hair came from exactly in my hair cause I had my mom looking for where it came from for me.  

HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION....
BECAUSE I KNOW SHE IS READING THIS SO THIS IS STATED TO:
TIFFANY ""WUTEVER"" DANIEL

This bullshit is kinda of silly and what not I will admit to that.  But as far as things being the same between us never that. To me you are considered an ""enemy"" for life.  Any Emotions I ever had for you dissappeared when I saw my hair on the ground ""no lie"". Will I ever try to fight you or wutever? Nothing is plan....but prom night I suggest you stay out of my path.  TAKE ALL OF THIS HOW YOU WANT IT. But I mean every word of it.
____________________________________________________________

And to other people who participated in such childish acts once I got in the office....I expected it from some people but not you. To the people outside the window to let you know I heard every thing that was said out in the hallway, Livingstons walls are shallow.  I heard everything from James saying let's see who pretty she is now....to Michael trying to take a picture to.....Laveta saying knock on the window she'll turn around.  So to James I expected that much from you that was your intentions from the beginning.... Michael which ever one it was, you never really existed to me to being with....Laveta you can take that fake make up and shove it up your ass so I suggest you stay out of my way prom night also TAKE IT HOW YOU WANT TO.  

But newayz yesterday me, shakila, Ashley, and DP was acting crazy up in the car...because my homey was pissed off and DP was instigating stuff all together but I won't paying him any mind. But it was cool....relaxing.  

My mom took the whole situation better than I ever imagined.  She just said what happened and was like ok wutever.  I thought she would over react like usual but she didn't. 

My Day ended better that I ever imagined because my friends Kim and Alexia came over and we all chilled and planned to hook up prom night so that's all gravy with me, I need some familar faces since they are changing so much now a days...but through it all I believe it was the way things were supposed to be except with TD, I don't think and still think things should end they way I'm making them, but at the same time I know how I will get if I ever got around her so its better off this way.  

Everything is str8 for prom so far regardless whether I go to prom, I still get to go out and what not like my mom originally a loud me to....so everything is not so bad anyways."

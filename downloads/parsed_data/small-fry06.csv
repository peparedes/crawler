"event","Hello guys... I haven't posted in a long while on here. I just got to looking at friend's sites and decided to update. I actually updated my xanga today, but I don't do it very often. I don't really have a lot of time to do it anymore. I started on Greg's valentines day present last night and I told him one thing...lol! I'M REALLY WEAK! ^_~ I wish I had a lot more to say... but I'm just sitting at school right now, nothing real special about that. I'll post sometime... hopefully soon!

ZACH! ^_~ Saturday we went to Matt's and they played PS2.... after I could actually keep food down and look presentable... Then we came back ""home"" and had supper with Greg's mom, Aunt Jennifer &amp; Eric, Uncle John, and some guy named Kenneth. Zach finally crawled out of bed about the time Greg &amp; I went back to bed... he slept a good 12 hours. I got up Sunday (this morning) about 11... it still felt like night-time! &gt;_&lt; I had a shower and then Greg fixed a PIZZA! My mom came &amp; got me around 2... and&nbsp; I have been home since then. It's back to the old grind... the nitty-gritty... wtf am I saying?! Want any more details...ask me!

From him I got: Enchantment (perfume,) purple Snooz pillow, a red old navy hoodie, and a green long sleeve old navy tshirt. *i love Old Navy ^_^* From his mom and dad: Victoria Secret pj's, VS purse, VS lotion, spray, and shower gel. From Jennifer &amp; Eric (his aunt and her fiance): Bath &amp; Body Works foot care set and a bag. I got him: a red polo shirt, a brown Old Navy sweater, a button-up Chaps RL shirt, a necklace, and Spiderman 2 on DVD. I got stuff from other people too! My momma got me a purse, 2 pair of Abercrombie jeans, pair of Mudd jeans, and sweatshirts... other little stuff like makeup. I got $15 from my grandma.

<P>When your friends ask what's new, you get mad at them because you already wrote it in your LJ and they didn't check it yet.</P>

<P>You've pimped one of your friends on journal, trying to get people to friend him / her.</P>
<P>Instead of doing research, you post difficult questions on your LiveJournal.</P>
<P>Your pets all have their own LiveJournals.</P>
<P>You know, right now, how many people have friended you (without peeking).</P>
<P>You've stopped being friends with someone in real life because of something they've said on LJ.</P>
<P>You're guilty of posting sexy or nude pictures to get more people to friend you.</P>
<P>You have consoled yourself after a horrible day thinking ""At least this will make a great LJ post""</P>
<P>You're jealous of people who have more friends and / or comments than you.</P>
<P>You have written a really great, solid post - only to be disappointed by the lack of good comments.</P>

When we got home, we had a little misunderstanding, but it didn't take too long to figure it all out. Right now I'm just waiting 'til time for him to get off work. Soo...

I told Greg I was going to the bathroom, as I go to sit down his senior ring slides off... into the toilet! LOL!

There is this girl that works with Greg who I thought was a ""friend."" Well... girls are NOT meant to be trusted... especially her. She's very two-faced, but I have no worries... She's been trying to get him to cheat. He won't tho, I know. Not being cocky, but he told me so. First, he ain't that crazy... second, he knows what he has and what he WON'T have if he did. </FONT></P>

When we got back we cooked pizza bread, and then we went to take a ""nap"" at like 6:45. Needless to say it wound up to be sleep til this morning...lol. Greg woke up one time and started asking me about school. ^_~ He was like ""what are your&nbsp;classes?"" and I was like ""...my glasses?"" It was very funny... ^_^! I now know his schedule...hehe!

Friday night we lost to Lonoke and we swung by Greg's house to get him after the game since he worked. Saturday we got up and went to my aunt's house for a while, and then played pool. Last night I was going to lay down and I said ""hey babe..."" and he starts laughing... well I really couldn't figure out why so i go to lay down. I see that there's not a pillow so I'm still confused and I go to grab him and all of a sudden he bursts out laughing &amp; I noticed that the laughter is not beside me. As I go to grab him, I grab his feet... he's at the freaking other end! ^_^ Then he made fun of me! He got a kick out of it. Anyways... I'm gonna get back to talking for a little bit! Ttyl!</FONT></P>

Saturday we went to the derby! We had a lotta fun. He won me a stuffed animal and a rose. My cousin made it into the final heat, but he got like 5th. After the derby we rode the Scrambler, and we talked to a few of our friends. Greg also ""ran into"" someone while we were walking around. lol! ^_~ Greg hadta get up and go to work this morning ... *puppy lip*... but I got to see his car! ^_^ Mazda 626!!! I like it!

I woke him up this morning and talked to him. He's working rite now. I seriously gotta think of some ideas for our anniversary *November* and for Christmas... I know that's a while, but it's gonna take me a LONG time! HAH! He told me the other day that he thinks he knows what he's gonna get me! Hmmm... I could always get him ANOTHER watch. His ""0"" fell off the 10. I paid too damn much for it to fuck up like that! Last Christmas he got me a ring... so ya never know about this one. ^_~ </FONT></P>

"event","Today was a wonderful day at band practice... NOT! I got up at 6:30 this morning to be there at 8. I had practice 'til 10. At 9:30 some dumbass hit my mom's car. It's gonna hafta wind up being in the shop for about 2 days to have parts replaced and then painted. After practice I went to Jessica's. Jr & James were there. We hung out til I went to the dentist.. and then I came back & stayed until 3.. which is when I went to go get my sister from her band practice. I came home after that and have been on the internet off & on since then 'cept to call Greg, cook, & then eat. I've been talking to Greg off & on since like 8:15 or so. I really haven't had the greatest day, but it's getting somewhat tamer. One good thing... I'm playing first part... or at least for now. Toodles!

lol. I went to go get him Tuesday night from work! ^_^ He was supposed to stay longer than just a night, but it's alright. He went to the dentist with me this morning. We went to his house and went swimming. I love Gretchen! ^_~ She should join TBAA! Tennis Ball Addict's Anonymous. Nothing like throwing around a tennis ball all the time...'specially while we're in the pool. heh! After that we went out to eat! 
We came back to his house only to drop him off... which I wound up watchin tv with him and playing with Gretch a little longer. Got a kiss from both of 'em! LOL! Actually a lot more from Greg... but hey, who's counting?! I came home, and changed clothes. I found his cigarettes that he left...Great joB! Then I got on here and it wasn't too long after when he got online! It's just about time for me to get to bed cuz I gotsta get up in the morning! I can't wait until Friday! Byea!

"event","<P>Hey all! I had a great weekend with Greg... like always! Friday I went to see my best friend, Kim, before I picked him up from work. She's moving to Stuttgart... which sucks!! I'll still see her on weekends prolly... so that'll still be all good! We went to Gillett Saturday and spent most of the day with another couple from there... my cousin &amp; his girlfriend. We had lots of fun! ^_^ Greg &amp; I talked about a lot of stuff last night before we went to sleep! It was really nice just talking about things that happened...reminiscing about stuff. I don't think my week should be too eventful... just the dentist Tuesday! Anywhoo... Imma go now! See y'all!</P>

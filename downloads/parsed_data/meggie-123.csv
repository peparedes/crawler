"event","Well I wake up this morning at 9:30 which is fucking early as hell. Dont know why I woke up so early but I get to utilize my enitre morning so I was pumped. ANyways call my dad and come to find out my grandmother was over yesterday and she passed out in the front yard. They had to lay her on the grass and she stopped breathing. My little sister stood there and watched my dad try to bring his mother back to life. A fire truck came, an ambulance to take her to the hospital. My dad ended up getting her to breath and we found out she has phnemonia again. The last time she had phneomia she almost died. Her husband my grandpa is dying of cancer. He cant even get up to use to bathroom. My heart is breaking....they are so young. 64 is way to young to die. I am terrified of getting old. I dont want to get sick and have to have people take care of me. Im going to be 20 next year and Im going to cry my eyes out. Situations like this really show you somthing. I only have one time in my life to be 19, thats it after this year I will never ever get to be 19 again. Waking up ever morning being able to go for a run is the biggest blessing anyone could ask for. When things get shitty I just remind myself that I am so lucky to be alive and be able to do anything I want. I can do anything with the rest of my life. My oppurtunies are endless....Life is to short. Its to short not to tell people you love them, its to short to not be happy ever day....its to short to not do special things for others. Anyone who reads this....enjoy everday as if it was your last because before you realize it you will be 90 and you will wonder what happened to your life.  * Meg"

"event","So I know that most of the time this journal is used for my venting purposes. In all actually my life is going really great. Im doin well in school and working which is awesome. I have the best friends a girl could ask for and Im lucky enough to have people that care about me. So for the few that read these, Im not a depressed, upset individual, Im just venting. Well today was interesting. I spent the morning in class taking boring ass notes. I spent my afternoon in doors, which was rather depressing comsidering the weather. It was absoulty beautiful outside. I love campus when its nice, everyone comes out and plays. Its so refeshing to see all the people in a good moood. I spent the later part of the evening in my lab class. P.S I fucking hate my lab. It is a waste of 2 credits- yes I said 2 credits which is supposed to be 2 hours outside of class, but mulitply that by 5 and you have how many hours I spend doing hw for that fucking class. Found out today that I have a huge project due next tuesday which is 20% of my grade. I have to find data write a procedure and write the conculsion for the entire project. Damn gotta say I love group work expecially when I do all the work. Also found out today that I will be working weds, thurs and sunday night at the bar. Which is great because I love it there- but bad because I have no time to do anything. I have a essay due on thurdays which isnt finished and homework fucking coming out my ears. I dont think 24hours is enough time for one day. If I could have a few more hours I would be SO happy.  My social life is completly none exsistant. I think I deserve that though...I partied like a rock star my first semester. Life is all about Karma. You get what you desereve, tooo much fun first semster means I have to work my ass of second semster. I have to work at the veeg friday, saturday and sunday. Once again, good because im making money to pay off my currently 400$ debt to my parents, but shitty because MSU is in the final four, which will be taking place on saturday. I have two hw assignments due next week, a reading check and a case anaylsis all due next week. MSU dance tryouts start next week tues, weds, thurs 7-10pm. Really really excited and nervous. I think my problem is that I have to many priorities. Everything needs to get done and everything is equally important. Well sleep- is not completly at the top of my to do list. It falls rather low on the scale of needing to get done. Therefore- ill probaly be a little grumpy the next couple of weeks. Im just going to take one thing at a time and focus all of my energy on it. Like tonight- essay is #1. When dance tryouts come- I will go and just think about dancing, nothing else. When I think about everything I have to do- I loose my mind. It too overwhelming for me, it makes me feel like Im just standing in a room and my life is swirling around me. My life cant be swirling right now- it needs to be perfectly in order, everything needs to have a set time and place. But the good news is that my family is coming home on friday. Damn I miss then. Way more than I thought i was going to. I need to speak with my mother. She calms me down sososo much and I need her. Shes kinda like my anchor. She keeps me grounded when I feel all crazy. Ok well the time is running out on today and I have shit to do. Tommarrow will be better, Im sure of it. *"

"event","So its 3am and for some reason there is not a whole lot of sleeping going on tonight. The dorm is so quite its kinda scary. I wish someone was up so i wouldnt have to sit here alone. I have so much on my mind lately. All day long there is no rest...even when I sleep I cant stop thinking. Sometimes I wish I could just turn it off, not have to worry about anything. It would be so nice- but I guess this is the way life is supposed to go. I should be greatful that I actually have things to think about. How boring would life be if nothing ever happened. Working two jobs and going to school dont mix though. Class on wednesday, work weds night, class on thurs, work thurs night, class on fri work fri night, not to mention the 45 min drive home everyday to work. It kind of like a never ending circle. Somehow Im going to have to find time to do all the homework I have due in the next couple weeks. Probaly not going to be sleeping a lot for the next six weeks. It will all be worth it in the end- thats what I have to keep telling myself to make it through the day. I hate sleeping alone, that might have somthing to do with me not sleeping tonight. I love the feeling of having someone wrapped around me all night. It gives me a sense of security in my world of choas. But fuck that- seriously I dont understand why im so needed all of a sudden. Normally Im fine by myself- I think Im just looking for somthing to latch onto. someone to tell me that things are going to be alright. But as always I know ill be alright and I know that I dont need someone- I do just fine by myself. had a dance clinci today for the mSu dance team. it was a bitter sweet experiance. There were so many girls there that were absoulty amazing which made me feel like shit. But it gave me this crazy drive to make the team. I know I can- its just to take alot of work. I need to make this tteam- its kinda like a personal goal I made for myself along time ago, and I have to give it my all. I was going to go into tryouts thinking if I make it I make it and if i dont it was a good learning experiance...but now I will make the team. Its going to be hard though- Many many hours in the gym working on technique. its all stuff i know i can do- its just putting in the hours. its kicking my own ass and not letting myself fail. I will be devistated if i dont make it because its all or nothing from this point on. So ive figured out what happened to me this year. I need some sort of structure in my life. I need to work or be apart of somthing that I care about- I need somthing to keep me in line. I always thought that I wasnt one of those people but come to find out im not as strong as I thought I was. So someone is deffinlty having sex right now right above me. She is fucking screaming so loud. Youve got to be kidding me, haha I thought that only happened in movies. Damn it sounds like it was pretty fucking good. At least someone is getting laid tonight. Haha wow that was interesting- didnt last very long though...poor kid! Well im going to try to sleep....."

My whole world whips around me
I feel out of control...
Wildly insain with desire
I can't seem to get enough
Every touch makes my blood flow
faster and faster and faster
till my mind shuts up 
and my body takes control.
Hands flying everywhere
covering ever inch of skin
Passion overtakes any thought of stopping-
Im hopeless I think
To many emotions for one to handle
Although stronger by myself
vulnerablity is key in relationships
To many walls to break down
Afraid of being alone..."

"event","Well Ive offically quit drinking. Haha not really but I deffinlity partied a little to hard last week. It started on wednesday and didnt end till monday. It was great though- like always:) Thurdays went to the bar with a couple of the girls. It was alright- I dont think I was drunk enough to have a good time at spartys. haha its kinda a shitty bar. Friday we hung out with some people that I went to high school with. That was awesome- I kinda miss hanging out with people that Ive known for longer than a semster. Got in a fight with him over god knows what. Anyways I dont really know what is going on with that situation. Hes stopped calling and I dont know what Im supposed to do. But hes seriously changed since he started hanging out with fuck face. I dunno- those two together is not good for anyone. Its not even good for them and I think they know that. I just want some honesty-how he really feels because Im lost in the dark. Should I keep trying? Or is it a lost cause? So sat. hungout with my high school friends again and totally fucked over my 2 west bitches- which I am very upset about. I left the girls on sat and told them to meet up with me later and they called and asked where I was. Well at that point I was at Cedar Village but we ended up leaving there for another party. Well the girls showed up at cedar villiage and I was no where to be found. SO they got a lil pissed and I still feel horrible about it. A friend of ours ended up getting arrested and one of megs friend did too. Meg and her boyfriend ended up breaking up that night and kimmie walked on her knee to much and about killed herself. So overall it was a bad night for them. Everything is getting better though. Ive had so much on my mind lately. All of my emotions are bottled up inside of me and I cant get them to come out. I know I have people to talk to but its almost like I just cant do it. Like they're stuck. Im just so unsure of who I am. I try to do the right thing and I try to be a good person but sometimes I just get so confused. I have never expierenced so much freedom before. I can do whatever I wannt and all I have to deal with is myself. But this new found freedom has made me selfish. Ive never been like that before but Ive come to find out that I can do whatever I want to make myself happy. I truley believe that you need to make yourself happy in this world because your not here for very long but you cant make other people upset on your route to happiness. There has to be some sort of balance- I want to be happy but I cant take making my friends upset with me. Because I truley care about them more than anything. I cant even explain how much I have learned since Ive gone away. As lonley as I get sometimes-its all going to be worth it in the end. I have to keep telling myself that. Miss you much lauren. Well I should probaly go do some homework. *"

I have never seen more taco at a party ever. There was like a 10 to 1 ratio of girls vs guys. But it was packed regardless. All the boys were so great to us-tons of free wine without the line. Danced a ton with my girls. It was such a blast- colleen fell on her ass. Haha Kimmie was trying to get her broken self around the party. It was hilarioius- she was knocking into everyone. Then the fire alarm started going off- we were locked in a room for like 45 min. Haha the fire fighter knocked on the door and told us to get out of the house. We had to walk by police officers on the way out. A little scary but being drunk kinda takes the edge off. Haha easy mac kicks ass at 230 in the morning. Nada and I deffinlty made the best mac ever. Talked to him last night. I dont think he sounded very happy to talk to me. I was good dont you worry!:) This weekend is going to be great. 3 day weekend and we started on wednesday. Im so glad to be back. I missed all my girlies. Classes were kinda long today- well since i missed my first one because my alarm didnt go off- my one class was boring. Damn i was so pissed this morning- i have no idea why it didnt go off. O well no since worrying about it now- ill just get the info from someone in my class. So I gotta go to class then im off to the gym. Cant wait to kiss those lips*"

Dance class was amazing-i dunno i cant really explain what dancing does for me. Its almost like i can escape from my life just for a little bit. I dont have to worry about anything and the only thing i have to feel is the music vibrating my soul. I dont have to be anyone or worry about saying the right thing. I can just be a body moving to sound. its so good for me. I need that...i need to be able to escape from reality.somtimes its just to much- i feel overwhelmed today. I have so much on my mind and im homesick. I miss the comfort more than anything. The comfort of knowing that people truly care...knowing people completly- the good and the bad. I miss conversations that i used to have with people. But ill be fine soon-it just one of those days. Its prety shitty out- that probaly has somthing to do with it. I dont want to work out today at all. Im sore as all hell and my head is killing me. I slept like 10 hours last night and im still SO tired. I dont get it- how many of hours of sleep do i fucking need? Maybe i need less sleep. I dunno though- it sucks ass being tired. I miss my lauren. I need her around- for real though. but enough dwelling i gotta go. miss you tons baby-"

I want him to wrap his arms around me and fall asleep listening to him breath. Ive come to some conclusions tonight-first off I know what I want...but theres alot of risks involved. I guess I just need to be honest and lay it all out there. Im not perfect- I make mistakes and I do say stupid things. I have alot to learn about myself...Im not who I thought I was. But I do care and I want to know you- the real you-not the you that everyone else sees. I want to know all your deep dark secrets, and I want you to trust me. 
   Anyways dyed my hair today. I was so scared and nervous but it turned out so cute. Its a dark chocolate color. Ive never had my hair dark before and Im crazy about it. Others than that classes today were awsome. I love my dance class and I love my rock class- aka natural disaters. Tommarrow will be such a long day so i, off to bed- sweet dreams everyone.*"

"event","Life is crazy isnt it? You never really know where it is going to take you-I mean the things I have experianced in the last couple of days has been incredible. It all just seems like a dream- Im still not sure this is all happeneing. I just cant seem to get the taste of your lips off my mind. I think you can tell alot about a person by the way they kiss. To be totally honest- I haven't been so passionately kissed in a long time. As happy as I am about everything that has been going on- Im terrified at the same time. Ive seen what you have done to other girls- how you have broken thier hearts. But I live my life by no regrets- so I would regret it if I didnt find out what could happen between us. For me life is all about the experiance-its not where you end up, its how you got there. Haha anyways last night was EXTREME! I had so much fun-got a little intoxicated with Jim, Deshawn, Dave, and Jims roomate-mike. So its offical I am in love with jager. Haha we managed to get to churchills by 11. It is a shit hole in the middle of downtown flint. But there were alot of people that I knew and everyone was being funny and drunk. I had such a blast- until jims car got broken into and all of our shit got stolen. My brand new leather jacket- gone-Daves jacket keys, cell, -gone. We had to break into Jims apartment...haha they kicked the door in. It was horrible. We had to break into Dave apartment but that one wasnt as harsh. Im just lucky that I got a ride with the sober person-not exaclty sure how that managed to work out so perfectly. So I actually talked to the guys that stole all of our shit. Im planning on meeting up with them and buying my jacket back. How much bullshit is that? Hahah I know- I just really liked that jacket. I have mixed emotions about going back up to school. Im really excited to see all my friends again and to party and carry on-but Im comfortable here. I mean it has been such a long break that I feel like Im back in my old life. Working at vgs agaiin and going out with all my old friends. Im going to be homesick again. which really sucks because as soon as I get all comfortable up there I have to come home for this super long break. It really fucks with my head. And Im going to be so broke this semester. So I have to get a job which is going to suck. I have to try out for the dance team this semster and I am SO nervous. I have alot going on this semester that I dont think I am ready to deal with. But I will get to see all my girls again. ANd I wont have to deal with my parents anymore. God they drive me insane. My mom has been bitching lately about me not being home. I feel bad for her because she justs wants me to be around but I hate just sitting at home. We are closer when I dont live with her. And my dad- omg- him and his lists of chores can shove it up thier ass. Driving me crazy! Well I gotta go get ready for the basketball game-hopefully Ill get to see him tonight. Kisses*"

"event","Wow its been a while since I've wrote in this thing-I guess you can say I've been busy. Busy doing god knows what...but everytime I come home it just seems like time flys by. First of all I have to say is be careful who you trust. Fakeness runs rampid in this god forsacen town. Let me explain- had this huge fight with someone who claims that they love me. BULLSHIT- you dont lie to people that you love...not to mention that this person was fucking someone else-should I say two other people-then continued to lie about it...but the funny part is that this person couldnt tell me to my face that they didnt fuck these people. You think you know people- you think that you have it all figured out until some bullshit like this goes down. Im sick of being hurt by people that I care about. Im about done with the male population. Seriously I feel like I am just wasting my life away- I used to love being single...its so exciting. But Im about done with all the damn drama that goes along with it. Things will be better once I get back to school. Once I get away from all the drama here Im sure that I will feel much better about the whole single situation. Anyways christmas break has been amazing. Aaron called me-out of nowhere. It was SO great to hear from him. It sounds like he is doing so good for himself. As much as I miss him-I really think he did the right thing moving out to Cali. He is one of those people that you will never forget...ever. Ill have to say that he is one of my favorite people on this planet. It was kinda the attack of the exes this break. Casey is home for chirstmas and Ive run into him a couple of times. Im so proud of him for going into the army. It really is a huge accomplishment. He is back the old Casey I used to know. Joe was home for break too. Hung out with him a couple of times. He is not being such an ass anymore-which is a major improvement on how he was a couple of months ago. Love hanging out with the kid but he is a little to much into the future for my liking. Im more of a fly by the seat of your pants kinda girl-not so much into planning my life away. Ive been hanging out with my best friend in the entire world-lauren. I am seriously so blessed to have a friend like her. She is my anchor throughout everything. Shes the one person that I know that no matter where life takes us- we will still be friends. Shes the one person that I know will always be there for me. Haha we dont even have to do anything and we have a great time. People like that are hard to come by. Im gonna miss her when I go back up to school:( The veeg hasnt been as bad as I thought it was going to be. Ive acutally been having a great time. Ive got to see so many people that I havnt seen in forever. Ran into jenny brady yesterday. I havnt seen her for months and she looked great as normal. I wish people wouldnt judge her and just let the poor girl live her life. I think she is a great person. It is amazing how much I miss my friends from school. They are like my family- and damn I miss um. Im going up north for new years to see a couple of them. I cant wait! They are So fun. So I think im going to daytona for spring break. OMG Im so excited- I was mega bummed out that I wasnt going to be able to go anywhere but my grandma hooked it up this christmas so florida here i come. I just have to talk the girls into coming with me. Even if they dont maybe andy will just let me tag along with his group. Anyway Im going. I can not wait to go back up to school. Im not used to my parents telling me what to do. I hate it- its ridiculous that they are even preteneding that they can control me. I mean honestly ive been living on my own for months now and i come home and i have a curfew. PLease! Haha it acutally makes me laugh because its so retarded.

That was an experiance-niether one of them really wanted to shop and both felt like nothing fit right. But all is well in the end they both got really cute shirts to wear out. We ended up going to a christmas party at SAE. I seroiusly danced for probaly 3 hours. I got burned on the hand with a cig. which at the time didnt hurt but today wow that bitch hurts. Ill have to say Richard is a damn good dancer. I love all those SAE boys- they are so much fun. I helped a kid puking- rather discusting...but everyone gets like that one time or another so you gotta help a brother out. Had to get up at like 8 this morning because my mom was coming to pick me up. That was horrible! I was so fucking tired and hungover. But I was glad she came and gotme because I needed to get home for the christmas party and the show. Not really looking forward to eaither Ill have to say. The christmas party is going to be weird-lots of old people. The show is going to be horrible to watch- I miss dancing so much. I miss class and all the girls. Hopefully I can find somewhere in east lansing to dance. I need to start looking for next semester. Seriously I need to stop being so forgetful. I totally forgot about Brians birthday party...god I feel like such an ass when I do that. I think Im going to start leavng myself sticky notes so I can remeber stuff. I have to much on my mind all the time and things just go in one ear and out the other. I lost all of my birthdays out of my phone which is horrible because I cant remeber birthdays at all.

Haha we deffinlty had a good time today. O my god today when I was walking to class I saw this dad and his son by the dumpster. The dad was in the dumpster getting cans and this little boy probaly 5 years old was standing next to the dumpster holding a garbage bag. It made me cry. All I could think about was how horrible the little boy must feel. When I see things like that I get this feeling like i was supposed to see it. Like god is telling me ""you are SO lucky, and other people have it so much harder than you"" I think its fate that you run into situations like that. It really teaches you alot. I have so much studying to do tonight and I dont feel like it though. I just want to run around and be retarted. I have such a hard time sitting on my ass for hours on end. I think im going to harbor springs for new years. Molly lives there and it sounds like a mega bash. I dunnno though- i dont think  i could leave my lil lauren.

Came back to the dorm after class and started studying. I feel like my brain is going to explode. I dont think I have ever read so much....EVER! I hate finals more than anything. I can not wait to go home. I love my brother to death-he is one of the best people I have ever known. We will for sure be best friends when he gets a little older. He makes me smile no matter how horrible of a mood im in. He has grown up so much in the last year. I hope he decides to come to MSU. We would have way to much fun. 
   Ill have to say im a little home sick today. I want to be at home with all the christmas decorations and the fire. I miss my mom SO much. She is my savior. I swear i can talk to her about anything and i know that she will be completly honest with me. I cant wait to see her this weekend
   So the christmas party this weekend should be fun. I've got the cutest outfit to wear. It is absoulty fabulous. The party might be a litle weird though because Im going to be the youngest one there by like 5 years. Free food and booze...you cant go wrong. Haha the christmas show is going to be SO hard to sit through. I will cry my eyes out through the whole thhing. I miss it so much. Little gracie will be dancing and im sure she will look amazing. She is such a great dancer. I am very proud of her, she has come such a long way. I almost feel like not going because i already know how hard it is going to be on me. I cant believe that i have been gone for a semester already. It went by so fast. It was such a great semester though. I can not wait to see all my friends again. Ryan is coming home...joe is coming home...lauren is coming home.. uhhh i cant wait. I miss all my friends and i can not wait. I think finallly joe is turing around. He is acting like his old self. I miss the old joe he was so great. I think he will be fine once he gets out of the marines. I get to see ashley too. I miss that girl.

I am not ripping on anyone...I am just talking in general. Im guilty of this everyday. I hate it-because you never really know if people are feeding you lines or if that is how they truley feel. Once again....guilty-due to the fact that I hate hurting peoples feelings. I do hurt feelings if they are a good friend or someone I really care about because that is what you are supposed to do to be a good friend. But in everyday situations people act the same way...they will tell you basically what you want to hear. I adore my friends that are real with me. We can sit down and have an honest convo and I dont feel like they are holding anything back. People pretend like they ""stand"" for certian things...but get them in the right situation and all hell breaks loose.  For ex. church girls at college- wow if you could only see the nasty things going on with church girls in a college setting. I am not dissing or making fun I am just making a statment. I have learned alot about myself and what I stand for. Things that I thought I would never do-Ive done. Not always proud-but never regretful. I just wish that people would stop pretending. Be who you are and if people dont like you then...to hell with them. Im on this whole new kick of being honest-and real with myself. It is rather enjoyable. I feel like finally I can be who I always was inside. I hated living in Fenton because you always had to worry about what was being said and who thought what about you and who heard what and blah blah blah. Ya know living in a small town will doo that to ya. Im not saying that Im some crazy wild slutty bitch- Im just saying that for once I can experiance. I can try new things and not be crucified for them. It is am amazing feeling. It is nice to know that the people who truly care about me...dont judge-they just let me do my thing and I know that they will still be there for me at the end of the day. Well as insightful as that was-I gotta sleep. Tomm. is filled with class,Hw and the fucking nextel store. P.S I am so glad to talk to him everyday and when he calls it really brightens up my day. Cant stop thinking about him...scared as always-hopefully I wont ruin this."

"event","I love Thanksgiving!! My weekend was so amazing. I got to go home on tuesday...which was two days earlier than I was supposed to. I got to hang out with my best friend in the entire world for 6 days. She is such a great girl-Lauren I love you and we deffinlty need to hit up the Razz. again-maybe a little mac and cheese at 2 in the morning? Haha always a good time with her. Thursday during the day was SO boring...my grandparents came over. They both are so sick and neither one of them can talk well. It is so hard to sit with them-I feel so horrible the whole time they are there. I just feel so sad that they got so sick and that they can't take care of themselves anymore. They used to be so strong and now....its like they can hardly walk. My grandpa is going in for brain surgery on friday...I dont know how that is going to go. He has been battling cancer for 7 years and doing kemo forever and I just dont think he is strong enough for it. All I can do is pray for him. Umm anyways-thurday night the Fouss came over. We drank chocolate martinies till midnight. My parents got completly smashed and so did the Fouses. It was one of the best nights ever. I adore my parents even more now that I have been drunk with them. Way to much...haha Friday went over to Clint and Curts. It was.....well you deffinly needed to be drunk to have a good time. It was great to see zac and all the other peeps I graduated with. Walking through the snow at 1 in the morning is quit a experiance. Everyone must do it once in thier life. Went shopping with mom and got a ton of christmas presents. Sat night I went to a party out in flint. It was so much fun. I went with a friend of mine and when we got there I was the youngest one by 5 years. I felt so out of place...they were all married and had babies and I show up double fisting it with vodka and juice. Haha after I got drunk...it was a great time. Played eucher and touched an alligator. My friend was so much fun and he took care of me...drove me all the way home by curfew. What a good guy! Would love to go into more detail but I never know who reads these. Haha got the drunk munches when I got home on Sat. Chinease food is the BEST when your drunk and hungrey. I layed on my couch at like 2 am and watch t.v and ate the best chinease food ever. So this weekend I decided that I have burnt some bridges. I want to appoligize to everyone that I have blown off since I went away to school. I seriously feel horrible because I dont want to loose any friends because I was to selfish to call or call back. So if I have offended any of you in anyway I appoligize. I needed to kinda detach from my life in fenton when I first moved here. I felt like if I held on at all I would have to hold on tight. Which comes to find out...I can live in both places. I realized that I can have friends in both places and that I need to not lose my good friends at home. I love all of you....forgive please:)Drunk dialed Ricky this weekend...but it went straight to his voice mail so he never knew that I called. Thank god it went right to his voice mail-I dont know what it is but when I get drunk I feel the urge to talk to him. But I can honestly say that it will never happen again. It is such a waste of my time to even think about him. I'm happy as all hell to be single. I love every minute of it. Well I should probaly go to sleep...hey by the way let me know who you are when you leave a comment. Thanks Lots of love"

"event","Last night was a blast...went to a party at cedar village. All of the girls and I got completly hammered and walked our drunk asses all the way to cedar village which is like a 30 min walk. Haha acidentally kissed kimmie and colleen. I adore the girls I live with-they are to much fun for my liver. Got a call from dave-he invited me to go with him to a christmas party with him. I am so exited...it is going to be SO much fun. Free booze and food, it doesnt get much better than that. Got a call from an unknown number at like 400am last night. I called it back this morning and guess who it was? Ricky...I was shocked. I havnt talked to him since he told me that he loves pussy and pussy loves him. He told me that someone else must have called me last night because he doesnt remeber calling  me. Anyways I needed to get some answer so I ask some questions and got no answer. He bullshitted his way throught the entire conversation. Once again I got no closer. He told me that it wasnt that he didnt like me or cared and that I wasnt a piece of ass. So basically the conversation was pure hell. I really wish he hadnt of called. I dont care how horrible a person he is...I still cared about him. It just hurt because there is nothing worse than liking someone and them not liking you back. I told him to never talk to me again. I cant take the pain. But no matter what happens  I know that I will be fine. I'm a fighter:) haha well I pretend anyways. Enough of that... ran into jake last night. It was awesome to see those guys. Well gave him my number and hopefully he'll be a good person to hang with on the weekends. Tonight I'm sure we are going out somewhere and we are planning on having a fabulous time! Well im missing out on a movie so Ill write later. Love to all"

"event","Friday already....this week flew by. I can't believe that thanksgiving is next week, I cant wait. A little recap of the week- I sucessfully failed 2 tests and I didnt go to class today...I was a little hungover this morning. School wise this week sucked ass. I am so excited to have a few days off from all the fucking school work. I finally talked to john nuffer this week. I see him everywhere and he always pretends that he doesnt know who I am so I grew some balls and said Hi. We had a nice little chat for about half an hour. I was supposed to go home today but I decided that I should at least spend the weekend here before I go home for about a week. My thanksgiving break starts on tuesday....very pumped. So as fate may have it- I ran into scott at the bar again last night. It is very strange I meet him at a party the first week I was here. Then I ran into him at the bar a couple weekends ago- which he never called me after that. Then last night somebody grabbed my arm and pulled me over and turns out it was him. WEIRD!! I think its fate. Haha Probaly going out tonight- I dont know to where though. Colleen, Pam, and I bought a handle so anything we end up doing will be super fun. I miss my Lauren. Cant wait to see her over thanksgiving- it will be just like old times. Colleen got her tounge pierced-it is So swollen. It looks really good though. I am getting re-pierced over thanksgiving. I miss my peircing:( Meg went home this weekend-I miss her:( Hopefully she will be coming back up on saturday. Well I gotta go get ready...I'll write again soon. Love to all the Yakeley Bitches!!"

"event","Wonderful monday... managed to go to all my classes today. Had a exam in the first one and a quiz in the second. Overall I think I did fairly well. Came back to the dorm after class and ate some Totally Takeout. Haha what a joke- sick ass food. I can not wait until thanksgiving... so I don't have to eat this sick dorm food anymore. Meg, Molly and I went to the nextel store to get my stupid phone fixed. Piece of shit...I've only had it for 5 months and it already broke. I raised some hell in there! Haha not really acutally they were very nice. We hit up the mall for like 10 hours. Meg did some serious shopping tonight. It was nice to be able to drive to the mall and not have to take the bus... sitten next to some stinky old man does not put me in the shopping mood!:) Gotta love public transportation. Anyways- got a candle at the mall and a smoothie. Got a call from my friend Mike today and we are parting it up this weekend at home. It is so weird talking to him... after 3 years of not talking- all of sudden he's calling. Anyways I love hearing from him and everytime we hangout we have a blast. OOOO how could I forget- bullshit truley travels fast. I say one thing about salerno in this stupid live journal and I have him im-ing me to bitch at me. PLEASE....I don't care what you have to say- I don't want to hear you bitch and grow up... seriously high school has been over for a long time for you. I said my piece and I don't want to talk about salerno anymore. I have mega big blisters on my feet. Friday night killed me... wearing boots with no socks is not the way to go. I have a huge geo exam on thurday. Neil and I are planning on studying all week for it but we will probaly end up talking the whole time and getting nothing done. That is what always happens. O well... you only live once, right? A personal ""I'm sorry"" goes out to lauren. I am very sorry for not calling you back tonight. We didn't get back to late and well I was tired. Haha I still love you! Well i have to go to sleep... 910 in the morning is ruff. Love to all- with a few exceptions:) *Megg"

"event","Well... let me recap this weekend. Thursday kimmie, meg, cole, james, me and a couple of our guys friends played battle of the sexes and got completly crunked. It was an accident I swear. I had an 8 o clock class on friday that I didn't make because I felt like I got hit by a truck. I felt so horrible because I think I am invisible when I'm drunk. I head butt and wrestle around-not a good idea. Brian and Danny came over at like 2:30 in the morning and hung out for a bit. Love those guys. Friday- Matt came up. We went out to eat for kimmie's birthday and we hit on a waiter. We left him matt's number and wrote call me on a napkin- this waiter walked up to me and was like "" you forgot to leave your name sweetheart"". I almost died. I just told him not to call that number because it was matts. I think the waiter was more embarrsed than I was. After dinner we came back here and got drunk and went to a couple of parties. Like always- we had a mega fun time:) Umm my rents showed up at like 10am with my bro. Hung over and tired I had to talk with mom. She let me know that I was not supposed to get greg wasted this weekend. Sorry Mom! Haha I got him complelty smashed. He was walking around talking to random people and laying in bushes. Haha it was great. We went to the game- which was amazing I will have to say. Little nap- then we were back out parting. He is trooper. A true michigan state student- he fit right in. I love that kid. Once again hung over and tired the rents came up to school at like 10am. Haha they picked meg, greg and I up and we went out to eat. AMAZING food. She made steak dinner with garlic potatoes. O my god it was soso good. Never a lack of drama at home. Went over to beebe's to say goodbye. He is leaving for flordia so I told him I would come home. I'm going to miss that kid. Such a wonderful guy. Stopped up at the veeg. people are still talking about the ricky situation. All I have to say is- i'm over that. Saw salerno- that was weird. If looks could kill i would be dead 100 times over. Deffinlty looking forward to going back to work at christmas- NOT. It is going to be hell- with all the rumors and lies I am like this new person. people even look at me differnt. It is strange. Over all the weekend was great. I will have to say that I am finally parted out. I am going home this weekend to get away from the parting. I don't think that my liver can take anymore. Haha I hate to say it but I have no desire to drink. So this weekend should be mellow. Hang out with people from home and just take it easy. Grandma chickie was in the hospital last week. I truley believe everything happens for a reason. Don't take people for granted because you never know how long they are going to be here. I was SO happy to see her on sunday. I need to tell her I love her more often. She is the sweetest lady. So lauren and brooke I love you. Thanks for being there for me. Love you all * Meg"

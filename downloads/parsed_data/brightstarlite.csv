"event","Well, I went to the Winterfest dance tonight, and granted, I had a better time than I did at homecoming.
I was dancing with Alicia's friend Brittany, and my neighbor Resa mostly. But then again, I also danced and chatted with all my other friends. ^^;
Then, towards the end (probably the last half hour) I hung out with Ryan. (Sorry, can't spell his last name. O.o) The last two songs we danced together, which made my night. ^^;
A slow dance and a fast one together. Hehe. I'm quite happy about it. (Yes, I have a crush on him.) I'm not telling you what the hell we did durning the fast dance. >_>'
Anyways, It's past midnight here, and I'm exausted. I'll update again whenever.

Later,

"event","I had a super wonderful fucked up day.

First off, people would NOT shut up about my lip. (I didn't mind about Andy asking... he was kind.)

Rhiannon wasn't at school, and she makes it bearable....

I did have a good time in second hour though.. but that's a different story....

Talk to you later.

"event","My day has been on the couch.. literally..

Well... I had an okay morning.. (woke up at 9:30 *shudder* weird) Then.. in the afternoon (after my mom got back from church thank god) my dog attacked me. I went to pet her, and she bit my face. Yes, my face. She only got the lower half though, basically my lip, so that's the only thing that's scratched up.
Scares me though. She could've hurt me worse where I needed stitches.. and I HATE hospitals....
Anyways..My brother came over after the auto show today.. (whoopie.. >_<)
He was here for awhile.. which I didn't really like. I'm not comfertable around my brother...

Well.. talk to ya tomorrow...(maybe i'll tell you why I'm not comfertable around my bro...)

"event","Yesterday me and my dad went out for supper to Burger King, then we went to Zellers to get a soccer notebook. On the way to the stationary section we noticed some shoeprints painted on the floor. Of course we had to jump from foot to foot on them. We were looking upon a miserable selection of notebooks when my dad said, ""What are we doing here? We could go to the MECHA!"" So we ran backwards on the shoeprints, almost fell over, and decided to just walk the rest of the way. Then some lady said over the speakers, ""Security camera to clothing, that's security camera to clothing"" so immediately I grabbed a jar of jam and my dad and I hid behind this big sign. Eventually, we got to ""the mecha"" otherwise known as Staples. We got a funky coil notebook and some silver stars and went home."

It felt like we couldn't do anything because my house has like, different rules and such, but we didn't care.We were gonna make a music video using my camera, strobe light and c.d player, but we didn't get to the taping part cuz Jess and Desiree just HAD to watch InuYasha.&nbsp;We were looking for a song to do from one of my c.ds and Ashey thought like half of them were Emo. Her and Des played darts. Desiree got a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bulls-eye.Ashley thinks my 'big room' in the basement is creepy and haunted. I agree. Especially the doorway. We took a bunch of pictures of orbs. There was like 10 of them in one corner. But they were all like pink or green I think. I think that's good. We read a bunch of books on paranormal stuff. Just the ones we got at the library earlier. I totally forgot that Jessica was about to sneeze, and Ashley saiid, ""Jessica's gonna sneeze!"" and Jess fell backwards into the end of a bookshelf...anyways, in the morning, I woke up at about 11:15 (3rd time I woke up) and I ate, put my contacts in, and got dressed before anyone else even got up.og,yoy I mtnyiob thst I hoy vonydvyf?

Anyways, we found like a ton of books on the paranormal and such, but all the best sounding books were in the archives. Yeah, then we went home...and now we're at my house for a sleepover. Desiree H. is here too...Jess and I saw this guy that looked like Hitler driving a truck. Ashley signed out a book about Hitler. I can't think of anything in particular that we did, except that Jessica can't close Ashley's van door. So yeah...I'm done."

"event","<P><FONT color=#993399>&nbsp;Yesterday, Fawne came over and we played with Rhea then got freezies and went to Des H's house to pick her up. We got there to find out that Desiree was leaving in like 2 hours to go to her dad's. So we went to Jenna's house, only to find that Jenna had gone out of town. So then we road around thinking of where to go next, and thought of Christina. We went to Christina's and picked her up. Then we road to Skylar's after some debate. Fawne could see Skylar for 2 seconds (Fawne said 3 minutes). Christina and I would wait on the lawn. Fawne went to the door and Christina and I took off on our bikes. Fawne caught up to us near the school. Then we went to Christina's, Christina threw Miko at me, and we had these ice-cream drink things. We took Fawne home, saw her cat Rusty, and danced on her dance pad, which was actually kinda boring but hard and easy too. Confusing, I know. So Fawne put on her bathing suit top and some shorts and we went to my house to do the same for me. Then we went to Christina's to have a water fight. Yeah...Christina yurned on the sprinklers in the front yard, we soaked the trampoline, and we made about 20 water balloons. A bunch of them popped right away, but that was fun too. Yeah...Fawne and I filled up bowls with water from the hose and dumped them on each other and ourselves. That was fun. Christina jumped off her garage roof onto the soaked trampoline. It was awesome. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399>&nbsp; Last night I babysat Jordy. (He's like 1 1/2 ) That was...not too interesting. He was really good though, compared to last time. We went for a walk and there were these 2 old ladies in a car right next to us, and I think they thought Jordy was my baby. You shoulda seen their faces. They were like =O. Anyway, I got to eat chocolate cake, ice-cream and chips and drink coke for 4 1/2 hours so...that was good. And I got 20 bucks. Woot!</FONT></P>

"event","<P>k, last night me, Desiree H., Fawne, Jess F, and Ashley M were talking in various ways (phone, m.s.n, ...) and Ashley and I had come up with a new name to the band. Desaparicido. Yeah. Just try and pronounce it. Then we talked a bit about Fawne's crazy uncle. Then we all (except Jess, she was getting her hair dyed) went for a walk. To Skylar's.&nbsp;So Fawne could see her beloved. Lol.&nbsp;We met up with Lisa on the way.&nbsp;Skylar and Colby got into a fight and Colby almost ran over Fawne with Skylar's bike. Skylar won and Colby ran away. When the 5 of us were walking home we found a bat! It was soo cute! It was on the side of the road and I don't think it could fly. It made really weird noises.&nbsp;We scared it and it started hop-flying into the middle of the road. A car came by and it just barely missed the poor thing. Then Lisa scared it the rest of the way across the road so it was safer.&nbsp;Later, after Des, Fawne and me went to the store, us, Skylar and Brittany (can't remember her last name, darnit) went to check if it was still there. We couldn't find it! Des and I are saying it flew away. *sigh* Frankie's gonna be all right. I think that's what Desiree named it. Des and Fawne slept over at my house and we had a fire outside. A black cat came into my yard and Fawne meowed it over. It was pretty young and it was really soft. When we were back in my room we heard it near my window. Fawne meowed and we opened the blinds and it leaned on the screen of my window. It was so cute.</P>

"event","<p>Last night my eye was a bit watery and itchy, but I didn't think anything of it. This morning I got to work and Selina suggested I go to the hospital pretty much as soon as she saw me. The eye had swollen through the night. So I wait an hour to see the triage nurse, then an hour to see Dr. Touchy-Feely. He gives me a prescription for some antibiotics and sends me on my way. </p>"

"event","This morning at work at around 9:10, I have my third customer of the day. I am just standing around working on paperwork, when the guy that owns the fruit/vegetable stand a few doors down walks in for his morning coffee. I Apologize for the machine not being on yet as I often forget about it. While waiting for the water in the machine to heat up, he goes on to tell me about how he had just lost a bunch of produce as one of his freezers stopped working last night. Obviously at this point the guy is having a rough morning as loosing a couple hundred dollars worth of products when you are barely making ends meet is going to hurt.

The guy finishes getting his coffee made and says ""Oh yeah, I have to check my Super 7 tickets."" I check 3 weeks worth of tickets for him with no luck, but when I check last night's ticket he wins $1760. Now that wasn't the huge jackpot, but it felt good to see someone who was on the verge of hard times finally catch a break."

"event","Since the Vampire the Requiem game is dying here as with all of the New World of Darkness games. We have recently been realizing that the games were just more fun when there is no real backstory like in the old Masquerade and Apocalypse games. The NWOD drove a number of our domains members away and for so long I wondered what it was about the new system they didn't like. Then Chris starts up his Dark Ages game open to members and non-members alike. When we saw the attendance numbers easily double and triple our Requiem and Forsaken games, we knew something was up.

After having to cancel a few consecutive Requiem games due to lack of attendance, I was nudged and encouraged to consider running a Masquerade game. So I have been working on a setting and developing the ideas needed to get this off the ground. I make the official announcement on the local Cam list and already I have 11 players (which is easily more than any recent Requiem or Forsaken games) interested in playing within 24 hours of announcing it. Now to get the message out to some non-Cam members and get them into it as well.

So the more thought I put in and the more I see other people's interest the more I get excited about starting this up. I am also looking forward to see what Greg gets going for his Werewolf venture."

"event","Well we got to bed last night around midnight which is typical for Tara and I. The atypical part was that Tara had to be to work for 6AM... so she had to be up at 5AM and out of the house around 5:30. Not so bad as I should have been able to get back to sleep, but fate does not like when I sleep. Tara's mother has been down since Saturday, so she was getting ready to leave to get the bus back to moncton. I was trying to fall back asleep but Debbie kept yelling at skip for making too much noise ""that it would wake Steve""... :p Skip finally stops playing with bags in the hall, when Debbie leaves around 6, so what does he decide to do instead... attack Steve's feet!  since my gout has been acting up this week that didn't feel so good. That cat is lucky he is cute.

By 6:15 I realize I am not going to get back to sleep so instead I get up and have a shower. I then play City of Heroes for about 30-45 min and get my Scrapper to level 50! Yay me... :) So tonight while Tara is out I will make a Peacebringer. :D

In spite of the excitement of the morning I still managed to be ready and at work by 7:45 and I am awake and alert... odd.

Tonight will be nice since I will finally get to spend some quality time alone with Tara when she gets home from going out with Rendell. :) It has been about a week since we have had time for just the 2 of us. I think we will get in a couple episodes of House... we are almost done the Season 1 set.

I see from Jess's LJ that Guns N Roses is coming to town. Hmm... if it was the original band I would actually consider paying the ticket price, but Axl Rose and a back up band of people I have never heard of is not worth $72.50 x 2 (cause if I did go I would be dragging Tara along for the ride).

Back to work time... paperwork and inventory counts to be done."

"event","Here I am at work with a pile of books to be stocked, but I needed a break. I was looking at the books that I was putting away and found out that Anne Rice has a sister who also writes. Her name is Alice Borchardt and we got a couple of her books in about werewolves in the Roman Empire. They look interesting, so I may take them home and check em out.

This past weekend was ok. Tara and I got groceries and did a little shopping around Walmart and such on Friday. Saturday, I ended up cancelling Requiem again due to lack of people to play. It sometime make me wonder if we should be bothered trying to have games. Yesterday, we had lunch with Greg and Chris which was fun. Then Tara and I watched X-men 3, which was a disappointing movie.

On the upside to Requiem being cancelled I had a chance to play City of Heroes and get my scrapper up to level 48."

"event","Well, I don't feel any different having turned 30. Friday night was good fun to have everyone over and have some drinks. Unfortunately I had a killer headache for most of Saturday. Thanks to everyone who showed up on Friday, really made me feel good to have so many people over.

Last week I got a tattoo, just before my birthday. It looks good, but it is starting to be itchy as it heals.

After the party on Friday I lazed around on Saturday for the entire day. Sunday Tara and I went to the mall to return a shirt that she bought for me which was mislabeled. We ended up bumping into Jess and she gave us a ride home. When we got home Tara did laundry and we watched 5 episodes of Smallville to finish up season 4. The season ended on a nice cliffhanger so I am looking forward to watching some more.

I was reading about a new show that starts on NBC tonight called Heroes. This looks to have some potential. It is about what average people do when given extraordinary abilities or something along those lines.

City of Heroes news (since Nicole tells me I play too much ;p)- I finally joined a supergroup with my scrapper and got him to level 45."

Well this Friday coming I will be turning 30. Tara is having a party for me. Music/booze/snacks and friends. She sent an e-mail out a week or so ago from my e-mail account since she didn't have everyone's e-mail addresses. Hopefully people can make it.

This past weekend was Impossible Realities. It was quite enjoyable, I got in some Living Greyhawk and got to try a couple of new games including the Serenity RPG. That is a game with a lot of potential. I think I may chat with Jay, who ran it for us about possibly running one for some people I think would enjoy it. There were a few people costumed and some looked pretty good except this one girl (beast Yuna from FFX-2) who didn't realize that some body parts were meant to stay inside the costume... shudder. Overall I think the convention was successful.

Beyond that Tara and I have been buying and watching Smallville and House lately. These are my 2 favorite TV shows right now. We also have a bunch of movies we have bought and not watched yet. 

I have been playing City of Heroes quite a bit and got my scrapper that I have been playing a lot up to level 43 this morning before coming to work.

Well back to work, time to clean the floors."

"event","Tara and I rented this on the weekend.

First off, I will admit to enjoying this somewhat.

The production quality... one word ""Wow"". It was that bad it wowed me.
The story was definately more of a D&D story than the first movie. They made a point of pointing out D&D references. So I liked that they showcased some D&D stuff, like the rogue disabling the traps and opening locks, The elf noticing secret doors, the clerics having the ability to heal and turn undead, wizards preparing spells and needing spell components. The barbarian chick was hot too... 

This would have been much better if the production was better and they didn't feel the need to shove things down your throat.

The best line of the movie goes to Nim, the rogue when he says: ""Turn around, I am about to employ 1000 years of rogue secrets and I don't want you to see."" This happens while he turns a very simple lever."

"event","Well, Tara and I moved into our new place yesterday. The move was an adventure. 

Last week we found out that we would be able to get in on the weekend, but since we didn't know exactly when, we were unable to reserve a truck in advance. Then we found out the rental place that Tara's mother was going with wasn't open on the weekend, even though there reservation call center was. 

So most people I knew had plans and were unable to help. I managed to get Andrew and Tony to help out and convinced my brother at the last minuter to drive his car for us. It took bribes of painkillers and pizza, but all is good. Rob also went and picked Tara up from work, so she got off early and came home to clean while we worked on getting stuff moved.

After everyone was there, we loaded up Rob's car about 5 times and carried some other stuff, including the bed, down while he drove. So all in all getting the stuff out of the place on Princess went pretty good. 

Later we went to Tara's mother's place where Tara had some stuff in the storage area and dragged another 2 carloads of stuff thanks to Peter (Tara's mother's boyfriend). Now all we have left is 3 or 4 pieces of furnature that we are getting out of there when they get a truck for Val's stuff.

Tara got all of the clothes and stuff like that unpacked while I started putting the new entertainment center together, but I was exhausted and couldn't finish it.

So tonight I will finish the TV stand."

"event","Long time since I had a real update. 

First off, Tara and I found an apartment. We paid most of the damage deposit today so that he would hold it for us. We will be moving in there at the end of the month. The place is on Charlotte st at the corner of Duke St. It is a nice place with a decent sized living room and main bedroom, a medium sized kitchen and dining room and a small second bedroom that we will be using for a computer room and there are washer and dryer hookups if we ever decide to get those appliances.

Work is going well. Free Comic Book Day is Saturday. We are going to be getting coffee again. It is going to be the self serve stuff similar to what we had before and there is going to be a seating area put in.

In the Cam my Requiem games have been picking up lately, which is very cool. Forsaken remains great fun and Mortal is getting good. Tara is now DC, which she is a bit stressed about, but she has some good ideas and will be able to get caught up on stuff as soon as Jared sends her the prestige logs.

DDO is awesome when we actually manage to play, but things seem to keep popping up that slow us down. I have also downloaded City of Heroes again and am going to see about getting back into that."

They dragged everyone that worked there in for a staff meeting with the promise of Pizza, which they did not receive. In the meeting the management told them all that the theatre was closing as it was bought by someone. Most have the option of working at the big theatre out east, but for some it will be tough to get there as their shifts start at 4:00AM.

"event","So Mark was just here in the store showing a lady around. Aparently this is one of the prospective people to take over the store when the renovations are done and the store is converted into a magazine store. She seemed like a nice enough lady, but I must say that they know nothing of uptown Saint John if they think that she could handle this place. Aparently she knows her shit when it comes to books and magazines, but if she were to be the one running the show here, there would be a very different vibe to this store. Color me unimpressed. I think soon after Christmas/New Year, I will start looking for another job elsewhere.

Aside from that I got the keys to my new place and payed my first month's rent. Later I will be picking up some of my stuff and chatting with Julie. I will need to go through stuff while I am there, and look at putting it in bags/boxes.

"event","Is it just me or do people seem far less intelligent at night than during the day? Or maybe I am just more well rested than during the day shift.

Here are some questions I was asked tonight:
- What kind of root beer do you have?
- Can I mop your floor?
- Do you work here? (while I was ringing in a customer.)
- How much are the peanuts? (Giant numbers that says .99 on it)

This is why I make other people work nights.

More idiotic customer comments/questions to come, stay tuned."

When you love someone, you offer them constructive criticism.

In friendship, you tend to give a lot of feedback - positive and negative.
Your ideal careers are: accounting, banking, art, carpentry, decorating, teaching, and writing novels.
You will leave your mark on the world with art and creative projects.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/birthorderpredictorquiz/"">The Birth Order Predictor</a></div>"

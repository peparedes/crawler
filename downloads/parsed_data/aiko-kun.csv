"event","I used my leftover coins at Club Nintendo to buy an application for my 3DS called Art Academy: First Semester. It was originally a DSi program, but it's also in the eShop for the 3DS. :D It's a pretty nifty application! It's basically a painting simulator using the 3DS' touchscreen.

There are lessons where it teaches you about the different sketching/painting techniques and it's really easy to follow along.

First day was today from 10:00am until 3:25pm. Worked at the customer service cash register for almost all of the shift. I've never worked with a cash register before so it took a little to kinda get used to it. Returns can be a bitch though! You have to match up the item to its place on the receipt they brought in and some people bring in receipts with like 50 things on them. :u If they don't have a receipt and it's something we can take back you have to call someone over with a scanner to scan the item and tell you the price and you have to manually enter it into the register~ This one guy came in with like 10 things he wanted to return and he didn't have a receipt for any of them. He just said his girlfriend gave him the things and just told him to return everything at Michael's. A coworker had to come over and scan every item lol~ I go back on Thursday at 8:30am.

You are in a perpetual quest to find the new, the exciting. Emotionally volatile, you are known for sudden changes of opinion, of appreciation, and behavior. Following rules and established methods is difficult for you and the difficulties of higher education are usually quite daunting. Knowledge is best gained through an intimate association with the matter at hand. Usually driven by attitudes and desires of the group, you are talented in an established field of endeavor. Emotions come and go without a strong understanding of their causes. They are unexpected guests in an otherwise placid landscape. You live by your own codes of conduct, which can be noble or terrible depending on the individual. Authority is meaningless to you. You hate to be predictable, at all costs. Rarely verbally effusive, you can at times feel as if your feelings are too deep for words. You are very observant, but rarely express these observations to others."

"event","My mom forwarded me a job posting for a package handler position at FedEx. After a couple weeks of calling the number hoping the recording would change and say they were hiring (updated every Friday), it finally did. The application process changed and now you have to do what they called a 'sort observation' before you applied. The recording basically said to be there at 9am to schedule one. I drove there (takes like 30-45 minutes) and all they had me do was reread the text that was on the job posting and then sign a sheet of paper to schedule the sort observation. It was actually later that night at 12:30am. So I drove all the way down there again and after waiting in a hallway with no A/C for a half hour we finally took the tour. The manager took us to the loading and unloading places and briefly explained what the guys did there. Then we left. The whole tour was around 10 minutes total. As we were leaving he told us to come back at 10am to actually <i>apply</i>. Drove down again and they just had us fill out an application online and it only took 15 minutes. These people. 

The next day I was called to come in for an interview at 8:30am. I don't actually have any clothes suitable for an interview and I couldn't afford any so my parents lent me a bit so I could get a simple nice shirt, pants, shoes, and a belt. Lia helped me pick things out~ One other guy was there for an interview at that time and let's just say he made me look amazing. They had to do a background check so I waited the 5 days or so. They called me yesterday while I was hanging out with Nicolle and Lia and the lady offered me a job and told me to come in today at noon to fill out papers to get me in their system. :D!

Today we just filled out a bunch of paperwork and watched two videos about FedEx and stuff. My training starts tomorrow at 11:30pm. :) Hopefully I can make enough to pay for May's rent~

In other news, I got Pokemon Black when it released and it is amazing. I've also started playing Radiant Historia and I'm really loving it. It's similar to Chrono Trigger in that it's a turn-based rpg where you can manipulate time. Radiant Historia actually focuses more on the different paths you can take and has a way to keep track of which decisions lead where. The battle system is fun too. Everyone is on a grid system and some moves allow you to change an enemy's position after an attack so that if two monsters are now stacked you can hit both of them with a single attack~ <a href=""http://dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/radianthistoria_10.jpg"">Here's Stocke</a>, the main character you play as. <:3"

"event","<b>BOT 3802 - Ethnobotany</b>
Professor is alright I guess, she wrote our textbook. The class is held in an auditorium as there are a ton of people in it. So far we're basically just relearning about plant biology stuff from biology II. We had our first test yesterday and I don't think I did too well on it. :c

<b>PCB 3044 - Principles of Ecology</b>
I have two professors for this course. One teaches the first half and the other teaches the second half (after spring break). My current professor looks a LOT like an older <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Krumholtz"">David Krumholtz</a> (a.k.a Charlie Eppes from <i>Numb3rs</i> and Mr. Universe from <i>Serenity</i>). I also had a test in this class yesterday and I feel like I did much better than the ethnobotany one. :)

<b>PCB 3044L - Principels of Ecology Lab</b>
One of my favorite classes so far. There's a lot of field work in this lab and I love it. Last Monday we took the biology vans to a cemetary and went through and took data from the headstones. We're looking at males/females that died before 1950 vs. those that died after 1950 and comparing their ages. We also have an ongoing experiment using flys. We're comparing two species of flies and how competition will influence their breeding habits. Each species gets its own test tube with 2 males and 2 females and then there's a third tube with 2 males and 2 females from both species in it. These flies reproduce like crazy! I guess they'd have to with only a two-week life expectancy. :P

<b>CGS 2585C - Desktop/Internet Publishing</b>
Another one of my favorite classes. The professor is pretty down-to-Earth and seems easy to talk to. There was also a 0cr lab on Fridays for this course, but since he wasn't assigned a TA and he teaches another class during that time he just told us that there won't be a lab. Instead he is using our Friday class time as the lab so if anyone needs any help with assignments or needs to review soemthing they can go to class on Fridays. But since there's no new info covered that day he told us that if we didn't need help then we can just not come. 8) We're learning about XHTML and CSS and the class is geared toward creation of webpages using those languages as well as proper presentation and the reasoning behind it. Pretty interesting stuff~

<b>CHS 3501 Introduction to Forensic Science</b>
This class is pretty awesome too~ Every week we have somebody come in a and talk abotu their job and whatnot. Last week we had a crime scene processor come in and talk about her job and tomorrow we'll have a fingerprints expert speak. :D

<lj-cut text=""School"">
So I'm in Orlando now and going to UCF. School sucks. I had four classes and I dropped two of them. <i>I dropped half of my classes.</i> I hated them so much and was so uninterested that I stopped going and ended up missing a test in one. The other was an online technical writing course and the professor wanted us to group up and contact real companies and have us write something for them that they have to actually use. 8I Group projects are hard enough to do in real life, so coordinating online with companies and the other members wasn't working out too well. Also, I'm probably going to fail one of my remaining classes and may have to retake it. Programming in C is going wonderfully though. :D

I also changed my major <i>again</i>. This time to Interdisciplinary Studies. You have to pick two general areas of study and an unrelated minor is required. e.g. you can't have physical science as an area and also minor in physics or any other physical science. I just saw an advisor today to actually declare it as my major and go over how many more credits I'd need.  You need 15 credits in both areas. 15 of the 30 have to be at UCF and 15 have to be upper level courses. If it weren't for these two restrictions I'd pretty much be done with the two areas already. My two areas are life/biomedical science and physical science (with a minor in IT) so I'm putting all of those science classes I took to good use. Since they can only make 15 non-UCF credits count between the two areas I had to decide which courses will count. I'll have 12 credits in physical science and only 3 credits in life/biomedical science (since they can only take 15). That means I have to take 3 upper-level credits in a physical science and 12 upper-level credits in the life/biomedical area. As for the minor, I only need like 6-9 more credits, mainly because of a restriction that 9 of the 18 credits of the minor have to be at UCF. Anyway, I have to take two Interdisciplinary Studies core courses and an elective or two as well before I'm done for good. That's like 30-36 credits all together, which isn't too bad I suppose.

I already have 4 classes picked for the spring semester~

BOT 3802 Ethnobotany (3cr)
PCB 3044 Principles of Ecology (3cr)
PCB 3044L Principles of Ecology Lab (1cr)
CHS 3501 Introduction to Forensic Science (3cr)
IDS 3933 Interdisciplinary Studies Cornerstone (3cr; online)


That gives me 7 upper-level credits in life/biomedical sciences, the remaining 3 credits for physical sciences, and the first of two core courses. I'm thinking of adding another class as well(maybe using a grade forgiveness to retake the one I'm failing now?).

<lj-cut text=""Car"">
Also, my car is going to explode. It's been stuttering when driving at idle speed or stopped (like at traffic lights) and the tachometer needle jumps. The strange thing is that when I put the car in park and turn off the A/C (with the fan still running) the car stops stuttering and the needle stops jumping. I took it to Pep Boys and had them run a diagnostic that cost me ~$100. They found that I had blown an ignition coil and it would need to be replaced along with the spark plugs too. Too bad they quoted me $750 to fix it. :'(

"event","So Friday was my UCF transfer orientation. I almost fell asleep during all of the boring presentations about the different school groups and whatnot. I was finally able to go pick my classes at around 2pm. Picking my classes for summer/fall took forever! Since I was admitted to the summer semester I <i>have</i> to take at least one course in the summer or my admission would be disqualified or whatever. The big problem with this is that there are almost no courses from my major offered in the summer. The only class that was in my major and open was an online general psychology course. So that's 3 credits there. Thing is, I need at least 6 credits to get financial aid. I still have to pick another class, but it's probably going to be another online course.

I'm probably going to go up to Tennessee with my parents on the 18th. I'll stay there until two weeks after June 28th (when classes start) when my financial aid comes in, which I can use to get a cheap apartment in Orlando until I find a job. :v

<br>
haha I just picked a second class for this summer~ PSY2012 (General Psychology) and ANT2000 (General Anthropology) are the two classes I'll be taking.

I bought Red Dead Redemption with the money on my FIU card and it's a whole lot of fun. I was mauled by a bear earlier! There's so much horse-riding though. I'm going to try and get the xbox 360 hooked up to my old laptop again so I can get on xbox live~

I also ended up buying the LotR trilogy (plus The Hobbit!) and a book called The Magician's Guild by Trudi Canavan~ And then I have the second book in the Chronicles of the Necromancer series that Nicolle let me borrow! So much reading~

UCF orientation is this Friday from 9am to like 4pm-5pm. ._. It's like a four-hour drive up there and my car has no A/C. And the front window fell off of the slider when my brother took my car out. And VW is fucking dumb and puts steel plates over everything so you can't get to any parts. I told my dad to just foam the shit out of it so it'd just stay up. Whatever.

foobar2000 is the greatest music player I have ever used. &hearts; You can configure pretty much every aspect of the player to your liking. There is a layout editing mode where you can insert/delete/swap the different GUI elements. :D You can set your own hotkeys, even global ones that you can use from other programs to control the player essentially any way you would ever need to. You can set it to minimize to the notification area in the bottom right corner of your screen and have it display notifications whenever the song changes. With global hotkeys set up to change songs/playlists you would rarely need to open it back up~

<a href=""http://imgur.com/CQNQJ.png"">This</a> is my current setup. The album list displays the albums in my library and can be filtered~ The selection properties tab does just that; it shows the properties of the selected item(s). The playlists tab shows all of the playlists I have and how many items are in each one. Bottom left element is for album art obviously. :P

My grades for last semester were alright, I guess. I ended up passing a pass/fail class that I stopped going to so... hurray? I'm not really looking forward to more classes this semester. :( I've stopped caring.

The video game fight night thing on Friday was pretty fun. 10pm to 4am of video games and hanging out in a Dunkin' Donuts. It was a lot of fun~ &hearts;

My car really needs a new radio. xD The buttons were all falling off and while it still worked fine, it looked pretty bad. Yesterday, I was trying to get a cassette tape out (the ones that connect to mp3 players) and ended up breaking it more. Last time I used the radio it was stuck on Y100 and also on a certain volume. :3"

We stopped to eat at a Wendys and I'm pretty sure it was what made me sick for nearly the whole trip. I only started feeling terrible on that second half of the trip up there. :( Have you ever been so full that you just couldn't move for fear of everything coming back up? That's more or less what it felt like only I wasn't actually full. I was hungry and yet I wasn't able to really eat anything. >:( It was terrible. Toward the end of the trip it would start disappearing and then somewhat come back later. 8| I missed drinking and hanging out with Pam and everyone though, which I was looking forward to. At least I made dollar hearts? 

I found the most amazing restaurant in Orlando the day before Nicolle and I left. <b>Tenders.</b> I bet you can't guess what they serve there. <a href=""http://www.tendersucf.com/images/Menu_Web.pdf"">Look at this menu!</a> Isn't it simply amazing? It was good too~ &hearts; &hearts;

I got this laptop back in 2001. Since then it has had many problems, but still somehow survived to today. When I got my new computer I gave it to my family to use instead of an even <i>older</i> PC. Sometime between Christmas 2001 and now, the screen half of the laptop stopped being able to hold itself upright. We'd just lean it against something and go about our business. :3 Since my family got a new desktop I took my old laptop back to use for various projects, which so far only consists of dicking around with Chromium OS. *can't think of anything else* xD

It needs a lot of work though and I'll just end up buying a netbook. The laptop only has 256mb of RAM, if I remember correctly, and wireless only through a PCMCIA card, which the Chromium OS build I'm using doesn't even recognize.  If I could buy/build a netbook for less than $200 I totally would. :("

Well i have some Ill Nino lyrics for you all


This times for real-title

Why do you tell me all these lies?
I just want to live my life
I don't want to leave my dreams behind
Tell me
Why am I only getting older?
My patience getting shorter
I'm running out of time
And I hope that I get what I wanted

Is there anything I wanted?
Is there anything I needed?
Anything at all?

Always pushing me aside
You do not decide what's wrong or right
Tell me
Why am I feeling so much pressure?
Am I searching for the answer?
I'm running out of time

and ""urrrrrrrhhghrgggggggggggehgrheg""- Wookie guys are my new things that i say. yes its odd. Hm Beaumont gets out tomorrow but i'm allready done bithces. Thats about it for the part of me that everyone see's if that makes sense. For my emo part right now. it's in fine tune nothing really going done i like a couple people but i KNOW they don't like me. yes that is one of my worest habbits though. so it nothing new. this post is extremly long for me but i'll keep going because i don't want to go own people on xbox live in paintball nor halo dos.hmmmmmmmmmmm o yes i got my hair cut today i thank it looks good i mean i like it but its whatever.NIGGA i dont know why i said that oo yes because kerri as to walk with on for grad. tomorrow well no nigga but a mexican nigga want to be. what would you call that white = wiggar
mexica= migga i dont know when you find out tell me. im pretty sur ei have ate nothing but ramen for the last 2 weeks NO FUCKING JOKE. the taste is getting old though. I got this new hunting game i sniped a deer from 450 something yards away then it told me i was hunting bear so it didnt count. i was extremly pissed so i havent played it aftr that.I relize that i extremly out of shape now. im a total fattie. lol. i'm happy right now for alex he got a girlfriend but it took some work from em and nick fred lol. So not to leave u out in the middle of no where i'll tell u the story. ok alex liked jordan and he told john. john decied to be a uber fag and go out with jordan when he knew how muched alex liked her this last weekend me and nick fred went to alex's house then to house and beat the whole fuck out of that shit head. jordan got grossed out by john now the broke up and now alex and jordan are goign out. it was great fun.i think i like nicole but i dont know i think i like alauna again but i dont know and i like someone not to be speaked off again but fuck i dont no. i dont think a girl well trust me after what happened las time. well its ok i might be leaving and getting out of this shit whole we call kentucky.i'm uber happy about that though. ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww i saw chealsie gamboa and amber at the baseball parks yesterday at the sight off them i almost threw up. and probably because the burger was total fucking gross to but mostly becaus eof them i dont liek them much anyways. i said nothing and at austin drive me home. lol. austin got in trouble when i was over at his and alex's house because he drove me and nick fred to johns house so we could beat him up. i dont think scott or adam know me and nick fred did it yet. thats good. well its about time to go to sleep but i could keep typing but my stomach hurts so i guess ramen or i might break the cycle and have chick noodle soup or something well later to my nigga homies pimp and hoes bitchassss"

"event","i might get held back so here's a little song that fits me right now lol


Watch you on the one's and two's.
Through a window in a well lit room.
Become a recluse.
And I blame myself because I make things hard
and you're just trying to help.
And when I wake up you're the first to call.
This is one more late night basement song.
And I'm so sore.
My voice has gone to hell.


And this is one more sleepless night because we don't believe in filler.
Baby, if I could I'd sit this out.


This is over when I say it's over.
This is a lesson in procrastination.
I kill myself because I'm so frustrated.
Every single second that I put it off 
Means another lonely night I got to race the clock.
I ignore it and it ignores me too.
What say we go and crash your car?
And every time I leave you go and lock the door.
So I walk myself picking at a chip on my shoulder.
I'm another day late and one year older.
It's failure by design.


And we just want sleep.
But this night is hell.
I'm sick and sunk and I blame myself because I make things hard
and you're just trying to help.
I got no gas. No Gas
I'm winding out my gears.
This is one more day on the verge of tears.
And now my head hurts.  Head hurts
And my health is a joke.
Now I got to stop because the headphones broke.


We don't believe in filler.
Baby, if I could I'd sit this out.


This is over when I say it's over.
This is a lesson in procrastination.
I kill myself because I'm so frustrated.
Every single second that I put it off 
Means another lonely night I got to race the clock.
I ignore it and it ignores me too.
What say we go and crash your car?
And every time I leave you go and lock the door.
So I walk myself picking at a chip on my shoulder.
I'm another day late and one year older.
It's failure by design.


I'm out of everything.
But no one sleeps till we get this shit out on the shelves.
It's late. I'm faltering.
But this time I got nothing to say besides: 
Do Do Do. Do Do Do.
Do Do Do. Do Do Do. Get this shit out on the shelf
Do Do Do. Do Do Do.
Do Do Do. Do Do Do. Get this shit out on the shelf
Do Do Do. Do Do Do.
Do Do Do. Do Do Do. Get this shit out on the shelf
Do Do Do. Do Do Do.
Nothing to say besides!
This is over when I say it's over.
This is a lesson in procrastination.
I kill myself because I'm so frustrated.
Every single second that I put it off 
Means another lonely night I got to race the clock.
I ignore it and it ignores me too.

"event","You know latly i have had an ass lot of time to think about things. So i have found an ass load of shit out just thinking about them and having time to do. Also i have been thinking harder at what people say to me and what the true meaning is. you know you all should all try it because it is sweet

The other night me and Recee were out and we got so pissed because alauna,katie,shelby,and lynn got are hopes up and dropped them so many times. Well yea me and Recee like ran the whole fucking trail to go to katies house and we were up by kroger so we had to cut though the apartments and it was odd. But anways back to the point when we got there it was the nasty thing i have ever seen in my whole effin life!!!!!!!!  The were all dressed up all werid and it wasnt very pleasing.  So then me and Recee went back to my house for about an hour and played  some guitar, then we called them back and we were like when you all come home pick us up at my house so we can hang out. They did but the dropped o off at REcee's house so we pretty much did nothing last night. When we went to see if tom was at eric's we saw matt outside and he like stoned up like crazy and it was pretty funny.


Today i had to games i had a couple nice hits but nothing amazing my dad said i play a good game and i was happy, because you know he scouts the really good players that are like 18 so i think it is special coming from him, usally he tells me everything i do wrong. Must of this week i have had a lot of time with him and he has tough me a lot. He is usally gone but it was acutally cool to hang around with him he is a funny man. 


I acutally really really wish i had a girlfriend right now because im feeling unusally lonly at the moment. well moment as in for like a month. But me and ben have been talkign about starting a band that would be sweet so if you think you have any sweet names send me them. I think i would have to play bass because he would take guitar an vocals but i like bass so its good.


But now on to more thing you probably wont care to read but it's okay. I have to start to get ready for hockey night in boston, Omfg im so outta shape for it last year we came in second but we should win it all this year. i think i should be able to bench 180 before i got to it right now i maxed out at 165 so i guess im kinda close, i also need to start doing heavier squats and legs press. right now my squat is at 175 and my leg press is 300 so i need to be doing a lot more before i leave so i can get looks for bording school. States for my cincy team is coming up right now we are second seed for are region and second in ohio but the number 1 seed beat us 9-1 last game so that was not fun at all.

I'm going to end it up in this paragraph because it anoth hopeless late sleepless night i think im starting to like so people and in some people alauna is pretty much out of the picture for ever because i figured out when im around her i get really moody and depressed and i hate it so yea i think im just going to be her friend from now  on 


Later"

They set me free
And they get me high
No since to flower

The heat of the affection

Because of you you
my dreams came true
Because of you

Becuase of you

My dreams came true
Because of you

And I feel the warmth in your touch
my ego trips
I can't get enough
That satisfaction
lies in your hands girl
I sing this song
So you'll understand

Because of you you
my dreams came true
Because of you

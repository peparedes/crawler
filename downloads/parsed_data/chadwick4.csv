Saturday I worked, and then Sunday, today, or yesterday as of 2 hours ago, I went to the mall to go shop for Russell's birthday present, and hung with Misty and Kimmy ""Kimmilie"" for a few, then went to Sally's Beauty to get a new straightener, then to Wal*Mart! great fun, then I came home and got ready to go to Russell's 4th of July party, even though it was only the 3rd haha...So Yeah I went, it was awesome, helped John set up all the fire works, hung out with Miles, Jill,Russell, Will,Andy,Daniel,Kayla,and the rest of those kids...Good time, got home at like 1, and now im bored out of my mind and quite tired, but it doesnt matter because im sleeping ALL day tomorrow! haha...Goodnight :)

    ""You say hello, and in my mind im screaming 'I LOVE YOU'""

And I rode BOTH my horses tonight...at the same time! no im kidding, but I really did ride them, one after the other ofcourse, it was fun I guess...But yeah, im tired, long day---kinda bored and hungry- I guess I'll update when I have something useful to say!"

"event","Today was so long and so short at the same time..I didnt end up going to bed last night until like 4..then Miles woke me up at like 11, and I just hung out for a while, then I got ready to leave, and Miles came back and picked me up, and we went to Jamen's to collect more change for their ""poor kids"" fund..Then we went and picked up Chris Atkins and went to Kroger to cash in the milk jug full of change and ended up with like $28..Then we went to Schlotzskys to get free food because they didnt want to spend their poor kid money, so we ate and headed to Sundown in the Old City...MY MORNING JACKET hell yeah, so we were at Sundown for like 5 hours and just hung out with everyone there but before it started, me and jamen and chris were sitting by the fountains, and this bum came and was talking to us and we couldnt understand a word he said so finally jamen decided he may not be safe so we went back up to the stage area, and the bum got kicked out...AGAIN! haha, anyway, it was a good time, then we all left and went to Taco Bell and watched Lauren play her little ""sentences written on Taco Bell Sauce"" game, so that was entertaining, then they closed so we just hung out outside for the longest time, and then left and went to Walmart after racing Woody,Chris,Ryan,and Robin there...and Met Shawn and Richie, then me and Jamen rode with them to Shawns house so he could drop off the car, and Miles didnt want us with him when he let out his ""Bitchy Girlfriend Rage"", then we all somehow ended up back in Miles's car and they dropped me off here and I just now got home...so yeah, I'm tired...and my throat hurts like a bitch, but I guess that's it for now..I work 9-5 tomorrow,not too happy about that one but oh well...I'll update later*peace"

I think i'm going to spend the night at my aunt margie's house tomorrow, and that'll be a lot of fun I guess...So I figured out some things to day and thought about them very deeply, but I'm still a little confused about exactly what the hell is going on in my life right now, but once I figure it out, I'll spread the word..But I'm gonna go for now, I'll update later"

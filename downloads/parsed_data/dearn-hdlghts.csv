"event","So I have decided to make up a list of this year's resolutions, promises to myself and vows to become a better and stronger person. 

-No drinking to an excessive amount 
-Learn to listen
-Be more patient
-Not shoot up heroine
-No more random sex with people I've known for only an 1 hr
-Become assertive and that ""no"" means no.
-Lessen up on the bar hopping

I can't think of anymore. But at least it's a start. I hope I can keep at least one of these. It'll be a little pathetic if I can't. I found this really good quote and it fits in quite nicely. 

<b><blockquote>""Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow."" </b></blockquote>

I guess I have to learn from my experiences, good and bad, and realize that the obstacles that I have overcome makes me the person I am today. And right now, I may not be totally satisfied with myself, but I'm going to change for the better. I have to. My life can't get any worse than it already is. I just need some help and faith in myself. Hopefully, the next time I write in here, I'll have something good to talk about. I'm so sick of being depressed."

"event","I am ashamed of myself. How could I let go of control. I'm trying so hard..but I wish there weren't so many HARD obstacles in my way.

Right now I'm looking out onto the porch. My dad is out there talking to some shady guy. I hope he isn't buying more dope. He's been trying to get off it, and clearly this isn't helping. Maybe I should go help him get rid of it...if you know what I mean.

I'm really liking this LJ thing. I'm gonna sign off now and probably update later so you all know the outcome of today's events. Peace out."

"event","I'm new at this, and whenever I'm new at something, I like to get down and dirty and learn it. I'm always the first one to put myself out there, and have the first experiences out of all my friends. The first time I made love to a man, I was fourteen. He was hung like a horse. I enjoyed myself greatly. I had five orgasms that day. I enjoy the penis so much, that I decided to take a break and head right for the cold vagina with its deep caves and chilly, and moist temperatures. 

ANYWAYS, I got off topic. This journal will be my hopes and dreams and in order for me to recover from my illness that I have been inflicted with for these past years. This illness drives me to sleep with strangers and it has taken over my life. I plan on joining LJ communities and talking with my LJ friends. Hopefully they can help me cure myself of my sexual problems.

Today, I woke up in my own throw up and I've made a vow that I'm going to pull myself out of this deep black hole that I call my life. I don't want to drag it out so I'm going to go meditate and collect my thoughts. 

See you later, 
Signed."

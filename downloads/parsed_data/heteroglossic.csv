"event","<font size=""2"">It's about the time of year when I should be registering for classes at Harvard [Extension School]. But I'm not. And I can tell you I agonized over this all summer (just ask my boyfriend, who had to listen to my back-and-forth arguments for months), but finally decided that since I have little interest in enrolling in the program, it just doesn't make a lot of sense to take a class I'm not even remotely interested in. I'm not sure why this was such a difficult decision for me to make; I've been doubting and second-guessing <span style=""font-style: italic;"">everything </span>I do lately.<br /><br /> In any case, I do feel that I need to continue to learn and absorb and grow intellectually. To that end, I've assigned myself a reading list for the next few months.<br /><br /><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Adam Bede</span>, George Eliot<br /><span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Madwoman in the Attic</span>, Sandra M. Gilbert &amp; Susan Gubar<br /><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Indiana</span>, George Sand<br /><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Save the World on Your Own Time</span>, Stanley Fish<br /><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Wide Sargasso Sea</span>, Jean Rhys<br /><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Is There a Text in This Class? The Authority of Interpretive Communities</span>, Stanley Fish<br /><br /> It's probably overly-ambitious. But I've already bought the books so now I have to readreadread. Plus I need to finish my George Eliot biography (by Gordon Haight--it's semi-hard to find, but well worth it).<br /><br /> On another note, I spent a lovely few days last weekend in Princeton and Philadelphia with my gay boyfriend.&nbsp; I liked Philadelphia, and because of its proximity to my best friend and its low rent, it's been put on my mental list of cities-I-could-move-to-when-Boston-finally-does-me-in.<br /><br /> I met with a group of incoming students this morning, and they are so young and eager and together. I feel old and washed-up.</font>"

I guess it's a stubborn belief that liberalism isn't whatever dogmas currently possess this or that lefty camp. Liberalism is an admission of uncertainty. It's open to self-correction and to the complexity and unpredictability of life. Many ethicists and other self-described liberals don't fit or accept that definition. But I do.<br /><br />...Not everything that's legal is moral. The most interesting moral questions aren't the ones you can settle with simple rules. They're the subtle ones you find in literature and real life.<br /><br />Conservative bioethicists think that when we recoil at something in this gray area, our repugnance signals a moral problem. Liberal bioethicists dismiss this argument as 'fuzzy intuitionism' based on an illogical 'yuck factor.' The liberals are making a big mistake. Fuzz and yuck are very real. They're a lot more real to most people than bioethics is. You can't just ignore them or wish them away. You have to help people sort them out and honor their concerns in a way that doesn't require prohibition. An embryo may be less than a person, but it's more than a tissue source. The government can't stop you from having a baby at 60, but don't be so reckless."" <br /><br />William Saletan, </font><font size=""2"">""Rights and Wrongs: <span class=""subhead"">Liberals, progressives, and biotechnology""</span></font>"

"event","<font size=""2"">Yesterday evening I had a doctor's appointment, and I met Nicey's parents.&nbsp; (The gynecologist told me I seemed tense.&nbsp; I said, Yes I'm always tense before a doctor's appointment and I'm meeting my boyfriend's parents for the first time tonight.&nbsp; She laughed and said I must be a masochist, and at least the pelvic would be over more quickly than the dinner would be.)&nbsp; I don't mean to compare stirrups with parents.&nbsp; But both made me think to myself that this thing with Nicey, our relationship, is real.&nbsp; I mean--interconnected; of consequence and with them too; not vacuous.&nbsp; <br /><br />I liked his parents.&nbsp; I was thinking that of course I would like them.&nbsp; They produced Nicey and so the things that are good in him, that I love, must have been in some part cultivated by them.&nbsp; Then I started thinking about how I want to distance myself from my own family and how when I look at my parents and my upbringing, all I see is my childhood shaped in one direction and then this void or separator and then who I am now.&nbsp; </font><font size=""2"">Periods or dashes instead of arrows.</font><font size=""2"">&nbsp; I think I've started to realize some amount of continuity, even if it's as simple as who I am now is just a direct reaction to how I was raised (but I don't think even  that is entirely true).&nbsp; I think that continuity is a good thing; it makes my family easier to love, at least.<br /><br />Back in the day when I was taking sociology classes, we always talked about how everyone is only ever a product of their environment.&nbsp; I think whatever theorists started saying those things wanted to recognize some sort of nuance (and certainly a lot of it was a reaction to all of that quack biology going on).&nbsp; But it ends up making things seem so easily explained, when they're not.&nbsp; And now a whole new wave of scientists are telling us how many things are related to genetics.&nbsp; Like how much a person smiles is tied to some random collection of genes that makes some muscles turn one direction rather than another.&nbsp; Or something like that.&nbsp; It's fascinating, and sometimes I wish I was a geneticist.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes I also want to meet my birth-parents, just scientifically.<br /><br />Once Dr. Chaney described the impact of environment on identity as the impression a shell leaves when pressed into wet sand.&nbsp; Actually, I think that's an image some post-modern theorist uses but I forget who exactly (I can still imagine in my head the way her hands moved when she said that, </font><font size=""2"">though, and where in class I was sitting</font><font size=""2"">).&nbsp; In any case, I think that's a lovely metaphor, especially when held in contrast to the image of environment as a rigid mould that we are poured into.&nbsp; I guess it implies or allows a degree of self-awareness that we humans are so keen on.<br /><br />I always like to end on a frivolous note, to help myself feel less foolish for all the pseudo-philosophical ramblings.&nbsp; So I'll leave this now:<br />Today is mine and my gay boyfriend's one year anniversary.&nbsp; We are celebrating at Tealuxe in Harvard Square.</font>"

"event","so.  work:  nothing is going on right now.  nothing.  fundraisers are in the fall because in the winter no one wants to spend money on non-profits, they want to spend money on themselves.  so our little company drops off the face of the planet, and i spend the days organizing my desk and the storage closet and the file cabinets and whatever else i can get my hands on.  and i read.  the new york times in the morning or the newest vogue when i get it, and a book in the afternoon.  right now, the unbearable lightness of being.  a good recommendation from a friend of mine, and the first time i've been excited about a novel in ages.  since hemingway this summer, anyway.  so read it.  we'll talk.

i take long lunch breaks.  it's 27 degrees in the middle of the day outside.  darren asked if your body froze instantly in weather that cold (he's from california) and i said apparently not (i'm from arizona), ice cubes take a long time to freeze so i'd imagine your body would too.  i take long walks down newbury street.  it isn't so bad, not nearly so bad as i thought, the cold weather, as long as i wear gloves and a scarf and tights.  peeing is a pain--the tights or the long underwear, etc., so i try not to do it much, which is unhealthy.  but i don't like inconveniences.

often i go shopping.  i spent way too much money on christmas presents at all the expensive stores on newbury street but restoration hardware really was the only place i found decent pink bathtowels for my mother.  if i never have to shop for pink bathroom accessories again, i will be a content woman.  

when i'm homesick i get lunch at espresso royale.  it reminds me of seattle.  i grew up in phoenix but when someone here asks me where i'm from i find myself saying, i'm from seattle, without even thinking twice about it.  i guess the three years i spent in seattle were formative ones or i've completely detached myself from my childhood, or both.  they make a decent latte at espresso royale (i ask for a double because they don't make thier espresso strong enough here in boston) that i add cinnamon to and good vegetable bagel sandwiches and they play music by bands that no one has ever heard of.  today they recognized me and i said, i'm from seattle and this place kind of reminds me of home.  they smiled like it was a compliment and in a lot of ways it was.

everyone leaves around 5 pm but i stay until closer to 6 because i've found the train is less crowded then.  i put on my scarf and my coat and my gloves before i leave the office and if it's too crowded in the train i have to take them all off again because i start feeling claustrophobic.  there's an art to riding the train: the 8:40 am train, which is almost always late anyway, is packed because of the business people trying to get downtown to work by 9:00, but the 8:47 am train is almost always empty.  8:53 am gets crowded again (i don't know why), but after 9:00 things seem to calm down.  outbound in the evenings gets crazy around 4:30 until 6:15 or so (unless there's a sox game, which is a different story altogether) because of all the kids going to coolidge corner.  i haven't figured out coolidge corner's evening appeal to the young and hip yet, but sometimes i get off there and buy dinner or groceries and walk the four-ish blocks home.  sometimes i don't buy dinner and walk them for the hell of it.

if i do go home and not to harvard square where my friend lives, i watch tv or movies from netflix and i clean or do dishes and take a shower.  mostly recently i watched breaking the waves which was stunning but not something i'd recommend to a lot of people.  i stay up late but not as late as i used to because i'm getting old and tired and i have no roommates to talk to and if i spend too much time by myself i end up going a little nutty.

when i do go to harvard square, we talk about things like wallace stevens and (recently) virginia woolf and dostoevsky and last and first novels and being raised mormon and/or christian and being gay and/or slutty and bakhtin and brocade blazers and home furnishings and friends and depression and insanity.  he drinks tea and i drink a mocha arabica at the cafe in the old brattle theatre, or we lounge around on his bachelor couches.  recently i went to harvard's slavic department party and refused to dance.  russians dance a lot, he tried to convince me.  but i'm not russian.  i'm an uptight bitch.

the end."

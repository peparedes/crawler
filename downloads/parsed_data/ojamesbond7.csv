"event","I haven't said much in awhile but there's been a lot going on. First of all, my SAT scores came in. I swear Viki better have done worst than me. I doubt it though. I improved my last score which is always good -- not by much. Old score: 1000. New score: 1090. My only comment on that is that math SUCKS. Now that it is Thanksgiving, I'm finally getting the break I need both for work that needs to be done as well as getting more sleep. I need a LOT more sleep though. I recently went to EB games to look around. To my surprise, they had a huge container of PC games 75% off! 75%!! I wound up leaving the store with Hitman, Unreal Tournament 2003, Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield, Risk, and Rollercoster Tycoon. I spent less then $10 for all of them combined. Now that was exciting! I also got a new phone. While I truly will miss my old flame phone, I love my new phone. Verizon has some pretty good stuff. And of course, Morgan has been continuing to be a sweetheart. Its official. She's my new peach!"

"event","Don't you love it when you have a hold on things? I love the challenge of maintaining that hold. It just makes life worth living when you fight to keep something alive. Right now I'm trying to make sure I can get As in everything but precal and physics. Not that I don't want As in those classes but I must think realisticly of course. All As, one B, and one D. What does that average in GPA? Hopefully something good. Morgan is becoming such a dear. She is incredibly happy around me now all of the time. She is so fun! I hope she stays that way! I've been getting more sleep now than I've had since April. This past summer was a bitch! Anyhow, onto the positive things of life. I'm seeking all I can and I'm not stopping. ""And I still haven't found what I'm looking for / And I still haven't found what I'm looking for"""

"event","Finally, I know what has been pissing Morgan off lately. I can't say what it was but, she was such a dear sweet heart today! My day went so so. I'm still trying to push my ""I'm excited about learning"" high. I'm convinced if I just stay with it long enough it will become habit and I will get good grades all of the time. And I still haven't mentioned the movie yet! Matt is almost ready to begin filming now that the scripting is almost done and the casting is finished. The movie is Beowolf. We are going all the way on this one. Nathan D. is Beowolf. Kudos! I was offered any role I wanted but I chose to just get a sword fighting part and help with the score. Nathan F. is writing the themes and from what I hear they are quite good. I will be writing and producing the score with Nathan as well as be the guitarist for all of the parts. Such a wonderful thing!"

"event","Life (since my last entry) has been quite good. With the exception of precal, I am improving all of my grades to some degree. This is wonderful! My social life, however, is disgusting. I try to talk with people that I know like me or at least respect me normally and they hardly offer any direct contact. I don't think it was anything I did though since I hadn't seen Morgan since today for the first time since Friday. From what I heard, someone had pissed her off so both Monday and Tuesday she just said she was sick to get out of school. I hate how gurls have emotions like rollercoasters. They let one little thing affect every thing they do. Guys just vent with it for an hour or two then they go about their business in order to make tomorrow a better day. Anyhow, while school is good, people are pissing me off. And the great (and scary) thing is that I am able to completely go through my day with my vengence contained even though I could rip them apart at a glance of an eye. So know one really knows what I am thinking despite how I act! It's great to be in forensics!"

"event","Well, aside from being pissed in my last entry, I feel quite good now. I've gotten over my mother's prejudices and now look on to better things. I am pleased at my progress in physics and precal. I actually know what is going on. I'm turning all of my work in and there is still a good chance I can pull off Cs in both classes. Which means forensics won't be without my services for too long! And if no Cs, I will still be going to Irmo! But I am optimistic and very postive!"

"event","Well, I took 2 bloody tests today. Physics and precal. Precal was ok. Physics sucked. To top it off, my dear mother asks me what I want for xmas. So being the dear son I am, knowing my mother doesn't like heavy metal, I settled for the great Rob Dougan, the incredible composer of ""Clubbed to Death"" and ""Furious Angels"" from The Matrix (Hear his whole alblum at www.robdougan.com ). Anyhow, I tell her I want the Furious Angels album. So 2 hours later I go to eat dinner and she tells me ""Absolutly not! I listened to the album and while the music is good his lyrics are so negative and dark!"" I then proceded to get very angry because Dougan is a great musical genius and just because of songs with ""death"" or ""drinking"" in the title she flies off the wall. Oh well. It's her bloody loss. I hate it when parents think that because they are older they know ""oh so much more"" than poor little young me. I may not be a musical expert and I may not have played piano for 40 years but when it comes down to what is good music and what I know I can handle listening to and what music and lyrical passion I have burning inside of me they know absolutely NOTHING. I am my own god of music, and with my own ability to play guitar, sing and accomplish as well as enjoy poetic beauty,I don't have to ""uphold"" their ""standard"" of music."

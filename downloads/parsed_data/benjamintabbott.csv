"event","So I read Catcher in the Rye in the past two days for the first time. Its a preety good book. I finished the last 50 pages today in harvard square, outside peets tea because it was a really nice day and there was a guy sining beatles songs with an acoustic. It was a really nice feeling to one, read a book again, and b read in a sweet outdoor environment. Im probably going to read like 20 books this month because i got selected to be a juror 9am-1pm every morning until december 1st. So I need some books to borrow preferably more american classics because theyve never really let me down. Well, except when I was in high school but that was because I was forced to read and I don't dig that. So I know at least 2 of my friends read books, haha, you fucking morons...

KLEINMOND, South Africa (Reuters) - A South African inventor unveiled a new anti-rape female condom on Wednesday that hooks onto an attacker's penis and aims to cut one of the highest rates of sexual assault in the world. 

ADVERTISEMENT
 
""Nothing has ever been done to help a woman so that she does not get raped and I thought it was high time,"" Sonette Ehlers, 57, said of the ""rapex"", a device worn like a tampon that has sparked controversy in a country used to daily reports of violent crime.

Police statistics show more than 50,000 rapes are reported every year, while experts say the real figure could be four times that as they say most rapes of acquaintances or children are never reported.

Ehlers said the ""rapex"" hooks onto the rapist's skin, allowing the victim time to escape and helping to identify perpetrators.

""He will obviously be too pre-occupied at this stage,"" she told reporters in Kleinmond, a small holiday village about 100km (60 miles) east of Cape Town. ""I promise you he is going to be too sore. He will go straight to hospital.""

The device, made of latex and held firm by shafts of sharp barbs, can only be removed from the man through surgery which will alert hospital staff, and ultimately, the police, she said.

It also reduces the chances of a woman falling pregnant or contracting     AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases from the attacker by acting in the same way as a female condom.

South Africa has more people with     HIV/AIDS than any other country, with one in nine of its 45 million population infected.

Ehlers, who showed off a prototype on Wednesday, said women had tried it for comfort and it had been tested on a plastic male model but not yet on a live man. Production was planned to start next year.

But the ""rapex"" has raised fears amongst anti-rape activists that it could escalate violence against women.

""If a victim is wearing such a device it may enrage the attacker further and possibly result in more harm being caused,"" said Sam Waterhouse, advocacy co-ordinator for Rape Crisis.

Other critics say the condom is mediaeval and barbaric -- an accusation Ehlers says should be directed rather at the act of rape.

""This is not about vengeance ... but the deed, that is what I hate,"" she said."

They were preety good though there new stuff is really different from there other stuff. While on Newbury St I applied to two places, but I dont think they were too interested. Oh Well. Ill probably end up at a big chain like CVS or Staples, but I can deal with that.....I almost took out my painting stuff like twice this week. I been feeling kind of productive, hense the job search....I also have to sign up for classes this week, I cant wait for school. Its gonna be fun. 

I still dont know where I am going to live come September 1st. I want to live in Boston but I dont because its kind of blah down here. Hardly any of my good friends are going to be here. Ryan Z is probably moving to Cali and Dino and Josh are going to Nashua. But I probably should since all my classes start at either 4pm or 7pm. And to drive home at 7 after a 4pm class, the traffic would suuuuuuuuckk."

I need someone to cut it. I hear Sarah K can cut hair preety well so I have to hunt her down. If anyone else can cut hair and is willing to do it preferably in the next day or two call me up.. 

I also need a fan or an air conditioner for my apartment, its ridiculous. I have to wash my sheets like every week cause its so hot...not very pleasing. 

I think I will be staying in the area for the next semester at least because Its too late to transfer and I like my school. 

I applied to a few pizza places because I think that delivering pizzas will be fun as hell. Going home with money every night and getting a check sounds preety sweet. I just need to follow up with them....

Only a few things missing in my life. I just need to work to get them, and I will be a happy little camper.

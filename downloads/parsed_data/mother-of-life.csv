"event","I was up and thought to take that wing quiz that was going around.  On two questions, though, I was torn between two answers.  So I took it twice, one with the one set of answers, and one with the other, and got two results.  I then mixed up the two choices in the two questions into different combinations.  Still I got the same two results.

Why am I confused?

Well...because <lj-cut text=""one of the answers was angel wings...""><img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/C/chaoscomesatnite/1073431691_Angelwings.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Angel""><br>You are one of the few out there whose wings are<br>truly <b>ANGELIC</b>. Selfless, powerful, and<br>divine, you are one blessed with a certain<br>cosmic grace. You are unequalled in<br>peacefulness, love, and beauty. As a Being of<br>Light your wings are massive and a soft white<br>or silver. Countless feathers grace them and<br>radiate the light within you for all the world<br>to see. You are a defender, protector, and<br>caretaker. Comforter of the weak and forgiver<br>of the wrong, chances are you are taken<br>advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often.<br>But your innocence and wisdom sees the good in<br>everyone and so this mistreatment does not make<br>you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will<br>try to help misguided souls find themselves and<br>peace. However not all Angelics allow<br>themselves to be gotten the better of - the<br>Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting<br>for the sake of Justice and protection of those<br>less powerful. Congratulations - and don't ever<br>change - the world needs more people like you.

<lj-cut text=""And the other was demon wings...""><img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/C/chaoscomesatnite/1073352505_DemonWings.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""DemonWings""><br>Yours are <b>DEMON</b> wings, possibly resembling<br>those of a bat - huge, black, and clawed. You<br>are cold and impure, and a born Creature of the<br>Night. Possibly with an interest in those of a<br>vampyric nature, or possibly one yourself. You<br>have little sympathy or care for humanity and<br>see them as existing for no real purpose -<br>thus, you can be very manipulative and bend<br>them to fit YOUR purpose. And you do have a<br>purpose, to everything you do. Nine times out<br>of ten it will be strictly for your own self<br>gratification or perhaps merely amusement. As<br>soon as a person or situation is no longer<br>productive or pleasurable in your life, you<br>will rid yourself of it or them. You could very<br>well have just a touch of superiority complex<br>(or perhaps more than a touch?). Despite all of<br>this, you are capable of love so intense that<br>you place that person's wishes even above your<br>own - the only time that you will do so.<br>Chances are you are attracted to people in<br>which you see...yourself. Though many hate you<br>for your carelessness and evil...Sexy, fierce,<br>sinful, and mysterious...you turn me on.

I don't really forgive. Not completely, at least.

Don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled, overjoyed, absolutely delirious with happiness that He forgave me.  I don't know what I would have done if He hadn't.

But it's not something <i>I</i> do.  Or did.

I mean, think about it.  I had children and a husband to keep alive and protect, as much from each other as anyone else.  There wasn't <i>room</i> for forgiveness.  When Cain killed Abel, I couldn't forgive him.  Not completely at least.  I had to take care of the others, and he was a danger to them.

He killed my son.

So instead I lost two sons.

But it was what had to be done.

But self-preservation doesn't matter to me, either.  Only worry for my children.  

They're both good things.  They're both important.

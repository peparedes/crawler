"event","So ok... I have alot to say but i'm trippin on a couple pills that i took  ssooo i'm not gonna write much... Ok... i dont know hwwhere to start... let me start from the part where everything started happening... febuary 12... me and my boyfriend of 2 yrs and  3 months broke up... and i though everything was gonna be ok... btu i was dead wrong... cuz see a couple days after we broke up i went to his house and got back a box of my notes and memories wtih him...  and he was like my only friend.. like real friend... so i didnt know what to do when i   lost him... so i was looking trew my celll and i saw jorges number... i havent talked to jorge in a while and i didint know who eklse to turn to.... so i called him and froom then on... me and jorge had chilled like everydayy... he was my bestfriend... i mean... i figure he knows me pretty good so he wont urt me or play me out in anyway... but i was so wrong... cuz he played nice to my face but behind my back he was my enemie... but i didnt know it at teh time so i left my self vulnerable to him... i was open book... ready to be burned... but then him and my brother started talking... and everytime he would come over it was my brother this my brother that..... but i kept telling my self ... not jorgge he didnt use me... so then i kept chillin with him and trustin him... then comes keith... he is this 14 year old who pretended to like me and pretended that i could trust him... and he was struggleing with his sexulallity...  so i had a friend named jonuthin... he was jorges friend and  i thlought he was so cool... i mean he was the funnest person... but he trun ed out to  be like this really horrible person.. so he told keith when he had him.. not to chill with me cuz i'm this andthat and all this bad stuff about me and keith beleived him... why i dont know.. btu he did... so keith and me havent talked in a whiel cuz hes not allowed to cuz jonuthin said so...  so there now what are we up to... lester jonuthin and keith hurt me so far... so then i met this guy named mike rivera... ii thoguh he was cool... and he defended me when jonuthin was talking about  me to him and he really seemed like someone i could trust.. i mean i kept all his really deep secret and everything and he knew mine... but then jorge got to him and he stoopped talking to me and spreading all these rumors about me.. so there goes mike.. i couldnt trust him eihter he told all my secrets..  and  then comes jorge and my borther.. i trustede  jorge sooooo much... he was htere for me evertime these people hurt me... so i needed someone too turn to...but joge hasnt been around as much.. and now everythign fell into place... se.. i met this guy jose and he was really cool... and jorge wss the first person i wanted jose to meet... and as soon as jose met jorge... jorge sarted telling him all my secrets... i couldnt beleive it.. but this time i wasnt gonna stay quiet.. so i told jorgee tha tits wasnt right and that the stuff he was saying was suppose to be for him to know only... and he said his sorry and that big mess.. but then my brohter confrnoted him and asked him why he said all that stuff... which got jorge scared cuz jorge is obbsessed with my brother.. so he though becuzx of me he was gonna lose my brother... so he decided to get me in trouble... and i dont mean little trouble either.. i mean bigtime trouble... see when i was still working at a&p i had this customer and she was bying weird stuff...  like not the usual... and when ii saw that they were paying with credit card.. it got me confused.. and the credit card wasnt going through... so i asked for the card and saw my brotheees enemies name on it.. but it was her with the card..... so i told the person that the card trurned out stolen to see what they did and they just lranned... so i had the order voided out and i had the card in my draw under the register...  when it was time to leave... i took the card with me cuz i knew the perosn and was gonna give it back... but it turned out that i never saw her cuz my brother and her stopped being friends... so i put the card away.. not thinking anything of it... i figure they would make up sooner or later... and then i would give it to her... ... so one day me and jorge were at the waterfront and he was looknig through my wallet and stuff and heh saw it and he asked why i had it and i told him that it was my borthers enemy and he knew who i was talking abuot..so..now he figure if i'm out of the picture he can be with my brother.. so he decided to lie to the girl who owned the card and tell her that i took it grom her and that i was usign it and the whole nine.. and she beleived him... and he called my borther and told my brother and i though my brother would know me better then to beleive him cuz you know my brother was the one person i told everything to kinda... you know you figure he's blood so he will beleive me.. so when i got home from the movies yester day and i called my bro to say how gr8 the time i had was he was talking aobut the card and i told him the truth you know i toold him i had it and that i took it away from someone and that big mess.. and he recorded the meesage on his answering maciene...  the nedxt day i gave him the card and tld him to give it to her or what ever.. and him and jorge totally flipped the storry and so now jorge got my brother to beleive that i stole the damn card and used it and stuff... and then my brother got my parents to beleive it and that wasnt hard cuz they hate me.. so now for helping her and taking the card away from that girl at the store... i got blamed and in trouble for it and now everyone hates me twice as much as they did and now i just am totaly losing it cuz now i have noone at all to talk to and no one to confide it... cuz jorge and my brother and my family hate me... they took away my other friends by somwe more lies... it makes me wonder... like i seriously think the whole world it agenst me and they all wanna hurt me and they all wanna make me look bad... i seriously think that theres no one  out there that will ever beleive me or trust me cuz there is always gonna be someone whos gonna take them away from me.. the only one perosn and i realize it now that i could have trusted with my life was lester... and i lost him... and i let him get away.. and know he hates me... the one perosn that i loved with my life and that i could have trusted.. i let go ... i feel so stupid.. and gulible... so i have 168 pills left.. its a mix of pills... they are just sitting there in the bottle.. and i am seriously thinknig about taking every single one... becuz i have no where to go.. i'm stuck here in a house of people who hate me... and of poeple who want me out.. but i have no where to go.. maybe i should just leave... and never come back.. i know they will be happy that i finally left...   i seriously dont wanna stay here in this house or even in this town anymore,... everyones against me.. i'm gonna give it a couple of days... like 3 days... by the 20th if i dont have anywhere too stay or go.. i'm just gonna leave... i'll go like on my own if i have to but i'm not staying here in a house of peple who hate me so much... ... thank you whoe ver is readnig this... i will keep in touch,... and if i decide to take those 168 pills i will give you a one day advance and ill let you know ahead of time...  gonne go cry to sleep now.. bye

   So anyway... i have things on my mind... well... my friends... well i dont know if i should call him that... well his name is jorge... he hasnt called me in like 2 days.. and he barely talks to me... i think he is tryin to take my brother away from me too... thats not nice... i treated jorge like family... and he played me for a fool... he brags to me that he can do things better... he bags and tells me who he hangs out with and how gr8 it was so that i relize that i  dont have much friends... and that makes me feel sad.. the only person i feel i can trust lives all the way in Morris County... murmur... but he realy makes me feel good... and he is a sweetheart... to bad he is so far... 
   well.. here is some good news... i sent in 3 applications today... when i start work maybe i will meet people to hang out with... or people i can talk to about things.. i hope so really bad... i really just want someone to hold and lean on when i'm sad or depressed... i'm sure i will find that person.. if me and someone are ment to be then it will be.. i just have to wait and relax till that day comes. 
  Wow i just saw a story about a guy who died and came back to life 4 days later on the autopsy table... thats crazy... wow... well... i'm gonna go... write in ya tomorrow!

"event","so i was talkin to people... and i wonder.. i wonder if they are truly... truly.. sincere... i dont know how to explain to... see i met this gr8 guy.. i really wanna be cool friends wit him...  and i really like him... i dont want him to treat me different at all... he treat me so sweetly,,,  he seems like the type though that worries about weight and stuff like that... cuz i remember the way he talked about it.. i mean.. i know for a fact i'm not fat at all.. but i'm not skinny...  and he is... so it makes me wonder if he will back off once he sees that i'm not skinny... i have this feeling in the back of my head that says he will prolly back off.. but from what i really know.. i dont htink he would... i think he is a real sincere guy.. not liket he fakes out there... i hope i'm right abiout him... he is different... he isnt like all the other guys... i dont know how to explain it... 
  Anyway, today i chilled with my brother and his friends at wearren park.. i heard one say behind my back that he doestn really want me around.. and he was suppose to be my close friwend... to here him ssy that he doesnt like me or wanna chill wit me... i dont know.. i feel kinda stupid... he was and still is just being my friend out of pity... cuz everyone  hurts me... i dont get it... why chill wit someone and tell them that they are cool and  they like u and the next minute to other people say the exsact opposite.. oh well,,, thats life.. rite.. at least i have 1 good friend... he knows who he is.. lol... well gonna go now.. byes

"event","Hey, whats up... today i'm in such a good mood... i dont know why... so anyway i saw this movie called Vannilla Sky...  Its was so weird and confusing...  but most of it was a dream...  In the movie there was this place called L.E. Life Evolution... you sign your life away to them so when you die... they take ur body and feeze it and they implant this chip in your mind that erases your memory of your past life and lets you create the life you want.. the way you want it.. imagine if that was real... would  everyone will go off killing themselves just to have a good life... but this is what i think.. why would someone wanna have such a gr8 life... if its not the real thing...  i mean i know that they erase everything in your mind so it seems real... but why do that... u might be happy subconsiously... but people you leave behind whouldn't be.. so why be so selfish and put people through that.. i mean i know my parents hate me and my brother hates me sometimes... my ex's dispise me... and my firends even hurt me and/or dispise me... except micheal.. lol... but even though they hate me... they dont want me dead. I mean... i know they will miss me... how could they not miss me... lol..  but seriously...  no one really wants anyone to die.. and no one really wants to die themselves.. they just wanna start over.. And thats the truth...  Now there was a comment to my last entry in my journal... they told me that i had problems for thinknig that way and for saying all that stuff.. they said that they think i needed help... but they dont understand that i'm over my ex.. and i have been for a while.. it hurt me and yea i felt like dieing.. but i didnt really wanna.. i just wanted a new life.. a start over... and i realized on my own.. with out therapy... that my new life was right in front of my eyes... theres billions of people out there.. and my ex's were just one adn i realized that... so i chose to met those people and i met a really gr8 guy.. i mean he feels the way i do with most things and he is very opened minded.. and i like him a lot... and there are probably more people just as sweet who understand me just as well. So thank you for reading my journal though... i really thank you for taking time out to read my journal... and now i'm gonna go read my book... its called ""Hush"".. I'll tell you about it later.. byes!

"event","So... ok...  today i was thinking... once my ex told me that if we ever broke up... that me and him had been through so much that we would always be friends no mater what... now... we broke up 5 months ago.. and i have tried to be his friends so much... but he refuses... he said he need time.. but recently i have heard from people that he never wants anything to do with me... and that he just said that so he looked good... but i know now why he didnt tell me from the begining that he didnt wanna be my friend... he knew that i wouldnt be able to handle it... i mean i was so wrapped up wit hate and lonleiness... the only thing that got me through those really hard times.. was that i though that we would be friends again... if i would have known what i know now.. i prolly would have killed my self... but now i'm alot stronger with the help of some people.. very important people that i have met over the last few days.. they brought me hope... (micheal)... lol...  
 Well today i was watching the MTV movie awards... And Eminem Rocked.. but my favorate performance was without a doubt KELLY OSBOURNE- PAPA DON""T PREECH... its was the best eva.. she was gr8.. lol She looked hott during the performance! Oh and other Hotties that i watched it for were Britney Murphy, Vin Deisel, Eminem, and Of course Jack Osbourne.. lol.. he is the coolest guy.. which makes him sexy as ever! It was good...

"event","ok... well i just got off the phone with my friends jorge... he said i'm complicated... it confused me... whats so complicated about me? Well when i asked him that question... he told me becuz i always have something to say and i'm so hard to figure out.... now what does that mean.. always have something to say.. well yea... of corse i do... if i have an oppinion... why not state to... whats so bad about my oppinion... why is it so hard to understand.. i mena i know i think differently about everyone... but everyone thinks differently about things.. and sometime people just dont say that they do... they say its becuz they are worried about what people are gonna think about them... why worry... why pretend like they are right and you are wrong just for them to like you.. I mean.. if they dont like you for you... then does that really make you feel better about yourself... i dont know... but if i pretended to be someone i'm not then i would feel depressed and hurt that no one liked me for who i really was.. i dont understand how people can be happy holding things inside... see watch its easy... just say how you really feel inside.. i can do it.. i feel a little sad.. and a little happyness... the sad coming from like 10 minutes ago i was thinking of how happy me and my ex use to be.. its made me sad to know that its over for good now... and the happyness is coming from thinking that i can meet someone who i can love just as much... meeting this certain guy onine... call it craze is getting me over my ex...  becuz for the last 4 or 5 months that i havent been wit my ex... no one could make me stop thinking of him.. but lately... for the last few day.. i have been thinking of this other guy from online a lot more then i have been thinking of my ex.. and what makes it soooo crazy is that i havent even meet this guy yet... not even once... but his personalitly is so gr8 that i feel like i have known him for so long... hmmm, i also feel satisfied with myself today as i said earlier... i have been myself and people are still ok with me.. i dont have to act like a different person for them to like me.. i can be my self.. and i'm and very satified with that... there see.. i feel so much better having all that out in the open... its refreshing that i have nothing to hide.. and having most things otu in the open.. lol.. of corse there are somethings that i do keep to my self... everyone has to have privacy... and private things to keep to themselves and only people who they trust...  but thats another story... lol... well... there i go again... hey... this journal is gonna have so much writing in it.. cuz i love to write my feelings down.. i express things better in writing... so Micheal this journal will not go to waste.. lol.. byes~

Let me tell u why.. ok... well, I always though that being my self was the cuz of my problems... you know being too nice and getting taken for granted.... and i though that i wouldn't never find someone who liked me for me... or who saw some things the way i did... bit last nite i was chatting to my friend micheal on line... and he is like the one person i hoped for... someone who sees things similar as i do...  he thinks i'm cool... and i'm being my self.. so there must be more people out there who would like me for me too... he makes me satisfied with who i really am... and i'm so thankful... and being my self should be enough...  hey you cant play anyone better then you play yourself right...  LoL... and hey the people who told me they didn't like me cuz i was too nice are calling me asking me to be there friend again.. and tryin to make things nice...  But they have hurt me so much before.. so i have to be careful... so far the only friends that havent hurt me live like 2 hrs away.. that's the only sad thing i feel today.. But watch when i fix my car LoL... I'm gonna visit him! LoL.. I would be so shy though... I'm such a dork...  Well, the only thing i'm not satisfied with today is being here at home.. my parents hate me... and i'm stuck here cuz i have no money to move away... i wanna move in with roommates that are nice.. and people that i can trust... not just anyone... what a mission.. first I'll concentrate on a job... LoL.. cant get no where without that.. lol... well, off i go... i'm kinda tired.. i'm gonna take a nap..

"event","Well, today I chilled with my brother..  and my brothers friends... LoL... my brothers friends Samantha likes me.. Awwww... she's nice... its kinda flattering.. Well, today... I was very disappointed by this word called trust.. to some people its just a word that means little.. to me it means everything...  everyone uses the word trust like it doesn't really mean anything.. but to me it means the world... one I  trust someone.. I really mean I.. I'm not just saying it... why do people miss use that word so much... I say I trust people because I do... and when I ask that if I should and they just say well why not... it hurts... because they don't take it seriously... when I tell people... "" you can trust me "" its because I know that they really can.. not just to make them feel better... I've had that done to me and it hurt like hell so why would I do it to people, and then when I say it to people and mean what I say... people don't believe cuz everyone says it.. but not everyone means it..  right now.. I trust absolutely no one...  cuz everyone in my life one way or another... even sometimes unintentionally screwed me over.. and I should be use to it by now.. but I'm not at all... I still get surprised when I find out that people that I trust lie and hurt me... it still shocks me... So yea... 'I'm honestly disappointed in the way people use the word ""trust""...

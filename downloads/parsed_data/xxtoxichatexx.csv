"event","oh my goodness im so frickin bored! ugh! im at the library once again..""doing homework""..lol i really was doing homework at first but then i got bored and frustrated so i decided to come write in my journal..(cheers..*yay*) haha yeah..anyways...
OOOOH YEAH....Ron gets to play singles in tennis today!! yay!! aww i love him so much!! I DO I DO I DO!! hehe <3  we've been going out for a month and 4 days. woop woop. haha. 

dude..lewie davis drives me fuckin crazy. i swear to god im gonna end up killing that kid. he sits there and labels people (prep, punk, skater...) yeah..and it pisses me off. like the other day, i wore a ""preppy"" shirt. (with my studded belt and Sugar shoes i might add) and he comes up to me and goes ""oh hey..kiera looks like we got you back! yeah!"" and im like..""dude what the fuck?"" ya know..he really pisses me off. he thinks im a ""poser"" okay..yeah whatever. how can someone be a poser by liking a certain kind of music? that's my main question!! *grr* 

another thing...STEPHANIE MATULKA!! jesus!! this chick..I SWEAR TO GOD! ugh! if she doesnt like the way something is she will just bitch and bitch about it until people give in and give her what she wants. well guess what..it isn't happening with me!! me and her used to be friends and shit but god she annoys me soo bad now! like everyone i know that used to be friends with her isn't now cuz she just does stuff to piss people off. like how she just broke up with her boyfriend (ryan) he's an awesome guy and she just CAN'T believe him when it comes to something she thinks he did. (which he didnt) but whatever..that's her problem. she just needs to fuckin watch what she says and does because if she does anything to piss me off i swear to god i cant take anymore of her shit. haha

but that's about everything right now!! :)"

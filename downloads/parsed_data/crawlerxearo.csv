Me an eve had so much fun yesterday..just being goofy and playing games...we were suppose to go to busch garden's yesterday but we didn't wake up =( So we stayed here, and my mom came home a day early...I couldn't think of much to do..I felt bad and tired so I guess I kinda just slept to much...Eve got upset v-v I told her to focus on the good thing's...Were going to Busch today so she can look forward to that...It's just sad that when she's happy I'm happy but when she's depressed it just completly over-takes her...It's not her fault though...I said I was sorry but I wasn't sure if it was I who made her sad, but who else or waht else could of it been..I guess I didn't make a good enough effort....She's ok now though, she just needed to talk and I listned...

So Busch Garden's will be a good time, and we'll have fun and not worry so much...

Hector get's to stay!! He's coming over and were going to Con, then He's coming back here to hang out with Me, Eve and Mikey and whoever else...I'm just worried he's gona get bored like Eve was, I'm not that entertaining really...and it sucks...

So this guy that's here all the time now, steve..little by little were talking more an more..I actually had a 20 second coversation with him about the food my mom cooked...It may not of lasted but it's a step...He's trying, I give him props for trying..."

<b>Posted 2 days ago:</b>

 Nothing incredibly happy to report...

The day before yesterday was my father's funeral...but it wasn't exactly emotional for me, I'v felt numb for so long now. It really made me miss him more but still no tears for a while...

What was really upsetting is that my mom decides to go out to a bar with the money she received that day...So She left for the bar pretty much as son as she got home...She was gone for so long...I refuse to get into her past right now...Just make it simple and I can say that she use to be a big drinker and stopped a few years ago...Now she decided to start again...She didn't get home tell 3:30...

All these new stories that Iv never heared..How she's been married 4 times...It goes up everytime I hear somethign new...Anyway It made me lose respect for her...I'v got to be reasonable I know..this is her way of ""copeing"" but she's taking is to a level that is unneccesary and wrong...Her and her friend sharyle...stayed up arguing all night...Sharyle is one of her old friends who staying with us for a while...anyway she met up with her Ex...Now she's been hanging out with him all day and Sharyle told her to come home and she didn't listen..if it wern't for her then my mom wouldn't even want to come home...

She went to bed at 5 and woke up at 6? that doesnt make any sence..she went out as soon as she got up yesterday....she didn't come home tell 10 this morning....She left me in the care of her friend so she could go out and drink...I really can't understand how she get's her relaxation that way...I can't look at her the same..she's two diffrent people now...Can't she wait a DAY before she decides to go out and do this...stuff?

My mom wants me out..I moved in to take care of her but she's made it clear to me..she'd rather have me gone so she can ""do what she wants"" I overheared her say I'm old enough to take care of myself, she wants to do what she wants to do and..Well, I don't matter as much as I thought I did....

I don't plan on stayign here that long anymore...a few month'...but what am I suppose to DO? College, but..I'v been so cradled in my life it makes me sick...Now she decides to just drop me...I'll have to wait and see how it goes...Everyone's all like ""you should be able to take care of yourself"" How the FUCK old are you people? Still living with your parents? If you dont have a better reason than I then fuck off...I'm fucking 17 fuck you...I don't have problams with people there just so fucking stupid!

That's a little harsh...I mean..As long as your going to college and/or try making somethign of yourself it's cool yah...but don't be a bum..like my brother...he's sucking the life outa my mom SUCKING the life outa her >.<

Anyway, she's bitching about money, she's been throwing it around on drink's, taxi's...blah...

What am I rambling about? Jeezus... Well she's home now....I don't know for how long though...

I should be more decriptive but I'm so tired of updateing about my life I'm thinking of just putting short post's like some people do...and stop treating this like an actual journal...I don't know...

I'v just lost so much in so little time...All I do now it sit and make art.....

I was going to go to Busch Garden's again with eve like we did last week but she got a job =/ ...Maybe I should look for a job..and a way to actually GET there...ha...

I still have that list of things to bitch about...maybe I'll get to that tomarrow...maybe not..

---------------------------------

Mike is holding a meeting this sunday and hopefully I'll get to go...So I was thinkign that everyone decided not to go Since Caleb said he wasn't but I guess not..Now everyone is jumpign in Mike's room O.o Ha this is gonna be greeeeaatt....Well I don't have to worry about paying atleast =) I already have to much shit to pay for lol Like me and Eve's ticket'....I hope we get the money I gave FOR the ticket it would help me pay for them...If not Ill have to put up ANOTHER 90 bucks...but I no mind...As long as it is for the people who actually cared...

I wodner how things are goign to work out now..and if I'm going to get my Outfit..Either way I could ride a bike to con if I have to ha, its close enough..

----------------------------
<b>Posted Today/Yesterday</b>

 The day's pass on like..days...one after the other...Fast...

My mom calmed down and isn't exactly all partyparty like she was so that's good...she really scared me...her friend still here...she's really nice...for the past few dyas she's been more of a mom to me though...She actually cooks! ...oh em gee....
Well...I really hope my mom doesn't hook up with her ex..who I'v never met..and don't plan on meeting...because if she does I think it will be the first time I actually ever hit someone...I'v never pictured my mom with anyone but my dad...and now that he's gone...I feel bad that she's alone..but she needs to slow the fuck down....I know my paretns marrage wasn't really a marrage for the past 5 to 8 years...they kinda just stoped talking and got seprate rooms...but she could atleast act like she loved him and misses him...

Anyway...I'v got nothin'....

I was thinking of going to an Art school right down the street....I need to choose though..If I go to The art School I could always switch back to USF in a year or two if I wanted..SO it wouldn't hurt...I just DON'T know what I want to do....I love art...but I also love money XD...Computer's...and being a doctor is something I COULD do if I really wanted to but it's just doesn't FIT me...Architecture is another choice that I really feel like I could be comfortable doing...I just can't decide...it jumbles my mind >.<

So everyone is all working out for Con...I think it's great cuz I felt alone XD Everyone all dieting and working on there ABS...FUCK! I'd be happy to have a FLAT stomach let alone some fucking ABS godamn xD I have been eating less...and it has been working (a little) I'm just worried Iwon't be able to get in a good enough shape in time for con..it's coming so QUICK! I'm thinking about...NOT eating...or eating very little like a week before con...All I need to lose is about...10 more pounds...then I'll be semi happy...
I'm not sure about the suit...I keep thinking everyone's gonna be like ""Oh you can't pull it off"" but then I'll be like ""WTF? This isn't about looking GOOD this is about having FUN...that's what con IS...""...y'know? So I think I'll try...even if I don't have the right hair or the right build...goddamn lucky people with high metabolism...damn them... 

------------------
</lj-cut>

<b>now</b>

well...I posted that on GJ...I havn't really been keeping up with this journal so I'll just copy my updates, if I continue to make important one's...I'll probably just start makign short one's...

Anyway...Hector...What's your E-mail? (maybe I should just check you Info O.o) and Mike...Goodluck with the meeting =/
There was somethign else I can't think of...Hmmm

<b>Ultimate Attack:</b> Fumetsu Shin (immortal god) -Is protected by all elements. (Can only be used if in risk of dying, can also be used to protect the friends around you.) This attack is used by calling upon the power of god(s). This attack was first used in a battle agaisnt Taishita Oni (greatdemon) and was used by speaking the words ""Dearou Mai Kensei Eimosu!"" (may my powers be born by god)

<b>Starting stats:</b> (based on 255 max.)
Strength: 40
Agility: 55
Intelligence: 65
Wisdom: 65
Constitution: 60
Charisma: 55 <i>(he speaks better in his writing)</i>

<b>Special ability:</b> Fukkatsu (resurrection)- cannot be used on self. (can be used to help other's and living creatures such as animals, plants and even the smallest of insects) -note-resurrection does not actually bring back the dead, it only cures ones in risk of dying when normal potion's arn't enough.

<b>Starting spells/techniques:</b> Basic- Fire,Wind,Water & Earth (Dark and Light Spells are acheived with more experiance and higher levels)
<b>Special items:</b> Makes his own Healing/Phoinex Downs (if you want to refer to them as so) because they cost to damn much in the market.
<b>Background:</b> He has moved constantly throughout life and hasn't had a chance to make friend's, but finally he feels (in the beginning of the story) that he has friend's that may last.
Personality: quiet&shy, giving and careing...he gets picked on alot so he doesn't want others to go through what he has been through. he also has a deep feeling of anger that is strongly hidden...this anger rises in his heart at times, slowly driving him mad. all is revealed later.

<b>How to get this character:</b> Catch him wondering around the Garden alone. He may not be where you last saw him, but his favorite spot is through the Garden's training facility into the hidden doorway that has been unused for years, where no one goes. It leads into a straiwell that goes down through underground hallways leading outside the garden. No one is aloud to leave past curfew, but he does. If you  catch him wondering around in the training facility past 11:00, look for the secret doorway. Follow him where he may either take a walk through the forest or be sitting by the beach, writing.

<b>Character bonuses:</b> His ability to learn much is useful. He has multi-talented skills in magick and potion brewing.

<b>Special appearances/sequences:</b> As his story is unraveled, the anger in his mind begin's to rip through his heart. Inbetween the middle and end of the game you are thrown into a battle that no one is prepared for, the demon is strong and you are weak. You watch as your friend's are being murdered, yet the demon laughs and doesn't attack him...just lets him watch his only friends being murdered. As they lay on the ground the demon stars down at you and tells him that he has a great power in his heart. A power that would be very useful to him. The demon holds forth his hand and speaks words that evoke forth the darkness within Jasutin's heart. As Jasutin lifts up off the ground, he watches as mirror image of himself forms out of the clouds of darkness surrounding him. 

<i>Boss: Taishita Oni</i>

The demon laughs as Jasutin drops to the ground in agony and watches the the cloud take full form of himself...but the dark form of himself has black eyes and no emotion in his face at all. As the pain in him subsides he feels enlightned somehow. The darkness and anger he once had was gone. He looks at his friends dying around him, and the two dark lifeforms before him, he calls upon the power of the gods, praying for help.

 <i>""Dearou Mai Kensei Eimosu!""</i>

<b>To take or not to take</b>: He's the second main charector in the story, so you must find him before continueing.

I beleive that is all for now. Maybe More later. I'm tired.

I hope you liked it anyway.
ByeBye~

"event","Having friends is such a good thing. It makes everything feel...just a little better when you need them to most. I love lisning and giving advice the best I can, and when I actually help someone, is when I feel best. Like Today.

I may not be able to change very many things, but it's such simple words that can give a person comfort, and make them feel as if they are needed, and maybe even loved. I hate to see such a sad face on someone I would like to enjoy the world for what it is, which is beautiful, so they can be beautiful...and happy...and not have to worry about such things as the downfalls of which life brings them. Seeing hope in there eyes as they realize someone actually cares and understands is what I love to see...unfortuanlty, I don't suppose this look, this look of hope, ...has ever been seen through my eyes.

I did also get to talk to my friends today, what Iv been wanting...but yet it is another day of work for them, so not much today...maybe soon enough. Anyway, this week-end will hopefully be another ""fun"" filled day with the walking and the...walking...and the going to the movies, and the...walking, but I honestly don't mind it when I'm with people who lisen & care. They do...Usually...anyway I suppose that's all i have to say for now.

If anyone ever needs someone to lisen, and they feel as if no one else around can hear them at all...my eye's and ear's are open along with any advice you may need. Thanx for caring

I know the one I'm planning on getting so that's cool...almost got my digicam, and I'm also plannign on getting a DS (this is all things I told my mother I wanted, she agreed.)&nbsp; When I get to Tennessee, my father told me he would by me a bike....oh god that's going to be awsome....I don't know what kind though...just something big enough for me...oh and a quad-bike...XD *sigh* that's what it is like in tennessee...People think I'v never worked...well the kind of work i did do wouldnt be called average work...but it was work. Not to the extremes of everyday, going to work, sit for eight hours, and then go home...what a day *wipes for head* nah...the work you do in tennessee is take care of shit...which is a lot harder then you would think...having over 30 achers to take care of...I don't want to get into details...ack I'll talk about it later...

But i do plan on getting a job...and goign to college...college is going to be great I just know it. This christmas is going to be huge too....Life will finally settle out...No more of this moving shit...and if my paretns arnt happy I will strap them down and feed them throuh a tube o.O....Gosh it's so hard to make people understand what's it's like moving os damn muh if they have lived in the same place there whole lives...but although I don't like moving (as much as we do) I don't think I could stay in the same house my WHOLE life...that would be torture...well maybe not for others...but its there decision.

I'v been getting a few people coming to me becasue they feel depressed all the time, there ugly, there sad, there life sux....My friend Sarah especially...she called me and said she is sick of guys (I hear that alot XD) and that every guy she dates turns out the same way...they always tell me not to change that Im the perfect guy and that im soooo sweet....NO NO ...I know waht your thinking...no need for comments I DO in fact know this is bull shit so calm down -_-....I think to myself well hmmm...soemthing's wrong here...there either one lying or two im ugly as shit and my sesitivity inst enough to make up for it?....Now either way Im fucked ~_~...But for people who want a lift once and a while...a confidence booster thats ok...I'll reassure you...but don't expect me to say the same things as ""im ugly"" or ""no one loves me"" becasue chances are if Im thinking it it's already true...

im ugly, im too sensative, im stupid and emo...is anyone going to disagree? no...don't hurt your pretty little fingers typing to me.

I can't...tell you...the words you want to hear becasue if I did it would probably be a lie...but if I do I guess your reassured Im tellign the truth...

Eh...Well...I guess that's it for now. Have I offended ANYONE in the world except myself? No, Yes? Does it matter? i don't know...

Yesterday I played Disgeia, and I also went to Mike's...It was really fun ^_^. I'll admit I was still...abit...mad at him. But he proved to me he really cares...it wasn't what I was expecting...it was nice just me an him. No one else wanted to come becasue of tnbtw/e...well I had fun so I hope there having just a dandy time O.o 

I talked to my mother and she keeps asking me why I look so miserable...I keep telling her ""this is my face!"" XD but she's my mommy and she cares, so I love her...She says I need to take more pills...I have no problam there...I think it's really stupid when you would rather go see someone who doesnt give a shit and think thye know you than to just take a tiny little pill...Some think the oppisite becasue ""drugs are bad!"" well fuck you! I don't give a shit so :P

Also she said she was getting me a digicam!<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v149/crawlerxearo/My%20Gifs/1099802822594.gif"">

So I'm happy ^_^...it's funny I asked her for a cheap DigiCam and she was like, ""well don't you want a good one?"", and I was like....yeah, but I don't want you to spen-, and she interupts, ""well I'll get you a good one then..."" so I just shut up and said thanx ^_^

I guess that's all for now...

ByeBye~"

Anyway I lisnted to a song in the car that sounded very familiar to some of the things that have been happnign lately...

----------------------
<b>LP:Breaking the Habit</b> 

<i>memories consume
like the opening the wounds
im picking me apart again

you all assume
im searching in my room
unless i try to start again

i dont want to be the one
the battles always choose
cuz inside i realize
that im the one confused

i dont know whats worth fighting for
or why i had to scream
i dont know why i use to cave
and say what i dont mean

i dont know how i got this way
i know its not alright

so im breaking the habit
im breaking the habit 
tonight

watching my cure
i tight and lock the door
i try and catch my breath again
i have much more
than any time before
i have no options left to give

i dont want to be to be the one 
the battles always choose
cuz inside i realize
im the one confused

i dont know whats worth fighitng for
or why i had to scream 
i dont know why i use to cave
and say what i dont mean

i dont know how i got this way
ill never be alright

so im breaking the habit
im breakign the habit
tonight

ill paint it on the walls

cuz im the one at fault

ill never fight again

and this is how it ends

i dont know what fighting for
or why i had to scream
but now i have some clarity
to show you what i mean

i dont know how i got this way
ill never be alright

so im breakign the habit
im breaking the habit
im breaking the habit
tonight</i>

If you don't like this song that's fine...It just got to me when I was listning to it...

Anyway...I guess I'll make more Icons for Eve...and some other people.

Oh Yeah Before I forget....I want to go to tnbt4...I have money...I'll pay you...and...do things >_> <_< ...I just need a ride...If not then I'll figure out how to get there some other way...I think you can buy tickets at the gate...atleast that's what the site said...if not I'll order them...anyway I need lift. I know you basterds are proud of your cars...and don't like being the driver...but I'd do it for you...most likely. I'd drive people but...I have another insurance problam on my hands ~_~

My brother is such a douche...i asked him to fix it and he said no and made my mom do it...what an asshole...

anyway...it's working now yay! I really feel bad about waking up past the time when everyone is already out of fucking school...theyve been out I know but it just feels weired...Do I want to go back? Is this feeling...regret?....FUCK NO! I hated highschool! I just miss my friends....if people would be kind enough to pick us up then we could all hang out...but I'm not gonna ask...that would be rude of me. 

I feel....kind today...I don't know the feeling...it's a nice feelign where you have no cares...you feel...well...nice. I just wihs I could share these kind of days with the people that matter...but I can't get ahold of them V_V

So I guess that's it for now...I'll float along the day as if I were on a cloud...then this cloud will float into the next day such as the day before and before...they pass so quickly now.

Today I took a long walk...thinking about a few things...I really wish I could just talk to a few people. Calling them will do no good, posting on a journal will only casue confsion, and asking my friends to hang out is absolutly out of the question because I would rather be forgotten about then avoided.

It feels as if there's nothing I can do...I keep telling myself there is. Things have to change...I can't go around being sad all the time thinking about how much everyone loaths me...if they do than that's there fault, I didn't do shit to diserve some of the stuff I'v gone though...It makes me sick to my stomach reading some of this bullshit people say about being bored with there lifes, doing the same thing over and over and how sick and tired they are of there friends...these people diserved to be slapped full force with a brick. 

Not to be a person who doesn't take there own advice...bitching about this sure as hell won't help so I'm going to stop...I'm going back to old methods of writing in a real journal that will sadfully be stained with blood.

How can you ever know what kind of friends we could of been if you never even took the chance?

of all the times that i became pissed
i thought you would help me, see me, or care
i just never knew you didnt give a shit about my despair

I slice and i dice on the wrists of my own
hoping and dreading to pick up the phone
thinking that talking would be for the best
but its not...it just made feel less

the feelings i have are of very few
but one feeling i do have i know consists you
i thought that you should know this 
and that i really care
but you don't care...and it's not fair

you think that your helpless when pain comes along
you have everyone i would ever want, to help you along
yet i lay in the floor helpless and lonly 
while your out with friends who think your the only

person who hurts, in this small world
but im here too...no im not...i dont matter to you

with the knife in my hand, i pick up the phone
anxois and hoping to hear your low tone
but when you do, you dont even care
that i tried to call...its not fair...

all i wanted was for you to forgive
my stupidness, carelessness, and selfish morbid
i should of known that you wouldnt be thinking
of me, my feeling, or my slit arm that's bleeding

you asked me what i wanted and i gave the answer
but now in the end it's eating me like cancer
i feel nothing and now it's all gone
well you shouldn't care, your out having fun...

my tears, my blood...there's more it goes farther

of all the times that i became pissed
i thought you would help me, see me, or care
i just never knew you didnt give a shit about my despair

I slice and i dice on the wrists of my own

with the knife in my hand, i pick up the phone
anxois and hoping to hear your low tone
but when you do, you dont even care

my stupidness, carelessness, and selfish morbid

Why must I trap myself inside? If I really wanted to I could go for a walk...try and call someone...do something to take my mind of how bad today sucked...no...I must make myself suffer. There's nothing I will do to try and keep the thoughts out of my mind. I'm alone. Nothing will take my mind away from the darkness...no one will. No one wants to.

For the rest of the week I have no idea what will happen.&nbsp; Maybe something good will come of it. I'v been getting nervous about my future...I can't wait to go to college, but I am so nervous of the new people...the way life will be...I have this vision of it being full of friends and good times...But not being happy with what I have now...will I be happy with what I will have later? 

All these problams I have are caused by me...lately alot of people have been telling me not to think I'm so powerless. If I could only take control of my life, stop being so depressed all the time, act the way that I feel and not be scared of what wil happen, and turn my life into a life I think is worth living...then I'd be happy. But I'm weak and looked down upon by (<u>some</u>) people. It disgust's me to think they could ever be better than me. These are the people I was talking about before...there's only a few...but chances are if your reading this then your a person I actually care about. Well, chances are better than good...if your on my buddy list then your a person I wish I could see everyday. But's it's not that I <b>WANT</b> to look down upon <i>them</i> as they do me...it's my fault in general for making myself appear that way, I only want to be able to show them I'm not the pathetic person I may appear to be <i>(sometimes)</i>.

Alot of people were pissed at everyone today but with good reason...I was pissed, Eve, and a few others...Doesn't matter anymore cuz I=Don't Care. It's surprising how you can look up to someone then suddenly you look at them and think...<i>Wat the fuck? There fucking stupid...How could I of ever even thought they were better than me?</i>

Point is...Never Think someone is better than you...You'll be surprised how stupid everyone in the world can be...arrogance and stupidity...It mixes together to make one load of bullshit. So yeah...just wanted to say alot of people surprised me in that area today.

Other than that, Nothing Much else went on today...just ate dinner at the club house....mmmm foood. And talked. 

Well...if I think of anything else I'll tell you...

"event","Today was going o.k. I figured no one was going to call so me an Eve made preperations for ourselves to go see a movie. We tried calling people but, of course, they were all out somewhere. Dannie's spending the night at her friends, and everyoen else is...somewhere...So me and Eve went to CiCi's.

We ate at CiCi's and it was completly packed..there wasn't even tables available and the line went all the way down the sidewalk. Luckily me an Eve got a two person table and ate next to this cute little baby who kept smiling at me ^_^;(\ I love kids (ages 0-1) but still don't want one. Past age 1 they get bitchy. So We went to the theatre and saw National Treasure and it was long but it wasn't boring. It was very interesting how they made everythng fit together. We went for a walk and talked about Sailor Moon for about and hour...I love Sailor Moon...anyway...I then said how I'm scared of the stars (I have a fear of them exploding) then we talked about diffrent htings...and as much as I try to explain things...I always screw up...

<b>(next paragrph has been deleted)</b>

I also talked about how I'v never really had a real best friend. I'v had girl-friends yes... They wern't very meaningful...Bad experiances in many ways...There's no reason to explain. I tired to explain a few things without sounding to ridiculous. Maybe some of you will understand. 

Sometimes when soemthing is wrong...nothing in any specific area just something...you feel the need to talk to a close friend who would know how you felt. That would be one of your close guy friends...someone who you could call a brother even. I'v never had that. I move so often I barly get a chance to make friends so I'm alwyas doing one of two things...trying to avoid getting to make friends or getting to attached to the people around me. Right now I'm getting to attached...but it'll end soon when i move...for the 14th time...

People never realize what they have...and I'm stupid enough to think that someone wouldn't say the same thing about me...but...havign a close friend who you trust with your life...and you feel you can talk to them about anything...your lucker than you may realize...without somehting like that...it's hard.

If your wondering why I say I'v had so many girl-friends (relationship wise) I&nbsp; havn't...Think more lowly of me...Very Very few...I'v only had, 4 girl-friends. All...Meaningless...That's why I told myself I wouldn't date...All I ever wanted was a true best-friend and I can't even have that because I know it will get ripped away....it always gets ripped away.

You would Think I would of gotten use to it...but it's not soemthing you can live without...obviously I'm living but...I don't want to...I don't want to go through life like this..especially when my teenage years are nothing but...emptyness.

<i>Ok fucking Mr.Emo go back in your hole...</i>

I was hoping if anyone wasn't busy we could do soemthin..I know you guys do stuff everyday but...simply hanging out would make me happy. And you dont have to aks if Eve's with me she's right here sleeping ~_~;...Anyway...My number is in my AIM info...but like your gonna call MY house <b>AHAHAHA</b> >_> <_< 

Eh..Guess I'll go to sleep.

"event","Today was the last day of my tests...I have to wait for the results...I shouldn't of had any problam at all passing it...it's just I hate nerves tests...

From now I guess my highschool years are over..not like they were much anyway...but it's just strange...I grew up so fast...

I don't know if I can go to school...hopefully...but where will I stay? What would I do...? Doesn't matter to begin with. I have...stuff to worry about.

Last night I had a dream...don't know exactly what to make of it...I'll start from the beginning...of what I remember.

----------
<i>THe dream beggins with me as a teenage girl (please god don't ask -_-) anyway...it's kind of like Alice in Wonderland...Except She's in a Shitty house and is constintly made fun of and mocked by her two parents (if any of you have read my story-some of it that is- then you will slightly remember) as it goes on...she crys herself to sleep (she as being me- it's kind of a first AND third thign goign on hear-it switches back and forth) and when she wakes her parents are gone...she looks around at her crummy house...and steps outside. When she does she's engulfed in brightness...this light...and when it dimmers...there are colors everywhere...beutiful colors...as a marble road, small fields, even street sighns but no houses or buildings...in the distance she sees a small city...so she walks toward it...when she get there things start to turn...there are people being murdered in the street by these ugly monsters...she hides behind a house but is spotted...she runs...she runs and runs while being chased by 4 of these things...then she falls into ....well it's not exactly falling...more like runnign into...this whole in front of her...then it closes. she's confronted by a dark voice and a very pale complexed tall man...he tells her to reach in her pocket and she does...she pulls out some kind of glowing pink potion..he tells her that if she wants things to return to normal then drink it...but somethings wrong...if she drinks it she'll have to return to her old home and that's not what she wanted...she wanted to help this new world and live here...as far as she could tell this world much so much more than hers...except for the monsters in the street...she decides to try and kill them...(I don't know how I guess my brain skipped that part) but she can't...she gets cornered by huindreds of these monsters and just about when there about to kill her she pulls out the potion and drinks it...then she wakes up...she goes out into the living room and sees her parents...she walks outside and see the old black tar roads and the cracked, molded street sighns...she's happy to be home but misses what the other world had (excpet for the evil evil monsters) ...then shit happnes and her parants turn into monsters and she jumps out the window and she back in the bright world again...she hears laughter coming from inside her mind....""the potion wasn't to wake you up...it was to keep you here forever...""</i>
 --------------
the next dream im just going to skim thorugh cuz it was really stupid and ...and uhh..stupid..
------------
<i>I walk out into the kitchen and all the lights are off...i see my mom and she's standign there in the kitchen doing dishes..and im like ""mom where is everyone else?"" and then my mom#2 walks past the counter comign in form the door and says ""there outside drinking"" so then i freak out and im like ""MOM WHAT THE HELL theres two of you!"" then my mom #1 turns around and she's like ""what the hell are you talking about?"" then my dad walks out of the bathroom and sits on the recliner then dad#2 walks in form inside and walks into the kitchen to talk to mom#1 and I freak out and run to my room and there GAMECUBES EVERYWHERE!! I'm like ""OG MY WALL IS TACKED WITH GAMECUBES!"" so then I run outside and jump of the railing and fall the water drown...</i>
-----------

After that dream told myself I would just stay awake...

Anyway...I don't have much else....anybody...im alone way to much for my own good..."

"event","I went to St.Pete today at Tomlinson Adult School. The first three sections were given today and the next three tomarrow. 

Now as far as I can remember, which isn't much, the test I took today was either incredibly easy or I didn't understand anything it said. One of those two...
Tomarrow's Test will probably be the same. 
The test were very...drama-tized...if that's a word. If made you feel as if the test was talking about you instead of other people. Weired is it not? Maybe it's just me...

Anyway there not much else to tell...Except...

--------------(<b>I'v labled the following as bullshit, becasese that's probably what it is-you do not have to read past this point</b>)---------------

<i>This Apartment complex is really stupid...there seeling our apartment for over half a million...who would by this small as apartment for half-a-mill? Greedy basterds...rich basterds too yes non the less there all evil...I hate them for kicking us out...if we had just had a little more time maybe....maybe I'd be able to stay though I still don't know. Even if I did...would anything change? 

What I want only matters to me so I suppose me wanting to stay is meaningless...is it so that it's better to smile and forget then to remember and cry? Is forgetting even possible? Is remembering even worth anything to others? I don't know...I wish I had help.

Holes that are missing in life...voids I should say...will hopefully be filled if I just wait a little longer. Answers I need, I can't wait any longer. Every second wasted could be forever to someone else. 

I am blinded...I want to see but can't. I am meaningless and stupid. The things I want, care for, think about, are all nothing to you...

(Pause for an IM)</i>

------------<b>Rant Over-Calmed Down</b>----------

YaY! One of my old friends from school IMed me so now I feel cared about...Strange how everything pops up when I start to think to hard O.o...My Dad..My mom...They care too...

Anyway, I'll be going to school toma@#$%#DAMNET!!! mosre tests....forget that...Friday I will go to school....XD

I ate my dinner at Target...how sad is that? I have done nothing preductive today and I feel...wrong. How can I try and do so much and end ruing so much more? I don't know what to do or say anymore...what I want just isn't good enough for the rest of the world. I'm not going to say I havn't been selfish...and that it's not my fault...It is. I want something yet I can't...can't control it. I want to be happy and I was...so were you.

Everyone's, just getting out of school I think. I am at home waiting for my mother to answer me. 
Nothing new so far this week. I'm wondering if I should go to school tomarrow. I'v got nothing better to do + my test is...TOMARROW OMG! I didn't even get my papers from school or anything...I don't even know where the hell it is...I'll just call them and ask. I can't believe it's tomarrow...I completly forgot. No big deal, I'll just call. Other than the test I think my week will be uneventful although I'm not sure. 

I will stat college soon, but first we have to find out the bank's decision's...will we stay or will we go...Pray for me...I want to stay.

I don't know how things are going to end up or if I'm happy about it. I miss hanging out with my old friends...I don't care if everyone says they were druggies or whatever...I miss them. When I was with them there were no worries and all we wanted to do was party and enjoy ourselves...Selfish? I think not...I do enjoy the friends I have now it's just there so many problems...eh I just wanna hang out and everyone else seems to want scream at me or someone else...tiz ok, once I get my car back I'll be fine again...I miss the feeling of driving...

This week-end will be fun I hope...No crying-sighing-worrying-moaping or groping...if there is any, I'm probably going to end up being the asshole in the situation becasue like many times when this happnes I end up ignoring it and becoming the asshole...just becasue I don't want to hear and deal with it, does that make me an asshole, or selfish? I don't know...I can't wait tell college...no worries...

Has this turned into a rant? I don't know...Im bored anyway...

*yawn* the selfishness of me...whatever. I just want outa life what I want...I come first right? Or is that to assholish for some people? When I get to the point where I feel comfortable with people, then I can deal with others and help them...Trust me, I like helping others I really do, but you can't help others if you can't help yourself...

I'm thinking about writing more...I miss it but I'm just lazy...and drawing more and starting to paint so that will make me happy...

Jackie's going to draw me a poster ^_^; I'm going to love it so dearly it's going to be so awsome...the great Saija-Man and Sailor Mercury...The perfect Couple ^_^(\ 
----
If Sailor Mercury ever decided to start liking guys (becasue I YES I say she's lesbion i don't give a shit what you think :P) she would definatly go for Gohan...
----
Anyway...

Well...What movies are showing this week-end? Dinner sounds nice...A few presents, some games, drawing/painting, and...what was the surprise...I don't remember ~_^ ............

Once we move I will concider myself free...I guess -_-...Im getting a hair cut hopefully soon...and I need new clothes...and a new self...cuz I'm to ugly for my...EveRyThIng...Hahaha-That made me laugh ^_^

*A third Yawn* Borrriinngg...class...I feel like taking a looooong bath, havn't done that in years...I take my little action figures too ^_^;(\

I have been walking around in circles since then...I updated my AIM info, Talked to my mom...and Watched my brother play Halo2...

My mother said they told us no to one of the houses...fuck them...my mother keeps searchign for more realtors for other houses...movign to TN is just to much trouble, so I found out she's pissed about it too...She said If I wanted to stay in Clearwater/Florida...Maybe if they keep saying no we might be able too...I don't know yet though so don't get you hopes up...Then I need to make up my mind within the next day...What the hell is happning to My...Life? Why does EvErYThIng have to be put on me? 

Well....I wasn't sure, I did look for houses available in Clearwater and found one on Highland and I'm like ""Hey, Isn't that where matt lives?"" or atleast nere there...Anyway...I found a few. I still don't know...I dropped out of Highschool for the sole purpose of moving to T.N....man was that wasted...yet still even if we don't move to TN I won't mind...I'm better of now then staying in highschool...

Eve maybe you got your wish...Wish a little harder and it may come true...

"event","Today was...blah...at first...mostly...all day.

I went to school, drew and cut-out letters for the sub-teach in A.E. class...she was selling peacons for her church so she made me sketch the words <i>""Peacons for sale""</i> and <i>""Plain Peacons""</i> and <i>""Plain peacons for sale only $7.00""</i>...I swear who the <b>FUCK</b> would want that many goddamn <b>PEACONS?!</b> I don't even know how to fucking spell peacons...I guess I do now...

After class I spent lunch with eve, jackie went home on a sad note, then I went home. I didn't get/give eve the pictures though V_V, but later I called her and Eve and Jackie were on there way to my house. They picked me up and we headed to Jackie's. At her house we played games, talked, and tryed to solve shit but...it all had to work itself out i guess...
Went to the beach, walked to the pier, played DDR...

Later we got ahold of Trent at Blockbuster, said he was getting off late, that's when we went to the beach--AnYwAy...
Got to Trent's house, called shane, Went to Wendy's, ate, picked up Matt and went to the park...A very energetic and tiring day so far yet NOT over...

At the park we all fooled around, acted stupid, talked, and then headed back to Trent's after a few hours...Dropped Jackie home....Tim decided he wanted to sleep so Eve had to go home too...I know she didn't want to and I'm sorry but...THis week-end will be fun ^_-

Me, Shane, Trent, and Matt wanted to go see if we could conjure up anything at the cemetary...I usually go thinking nothing of it...honestly I know it sounds stupid saying I have no fears...but when your not scared of dying then what's to be afraid of? 

We drove to Trent's and sat around a bit, got shit like a recorder, flash light, and headed toward the graves...We parked back at the day-care center or whatever the fuck it was....and had the loooooong ass walk to the graves...

As we walked I hadn't said a word since Eve had to leave...I really hate it when I'm so quiet...I want ot say so many things...but I just feel like I don't matter so I shut-up...one reason I knew I wanted to go is to show everyone I wasn't the Quiet, asshole person I seemed to be...and at first it wasn't working...

We kinda talked about D&D (this was a <i>very</i> long walk) and I kinda started to talk after Trent mentioned me...

We got to the Graves, turned on the recorder and walked while tyring to have contact...with somehting...anything really. First Matt, then Trent, Then Shane, THe Matt again....I guess I didn't offer or wasn't involved enough to give it a try...I hadn't doen it before...but I honestly htink if I tried...I actually be good at it...it sounds stupid coming from me but I really think I could do it...

Anyway, I did actually start hearing things...footsteps...not norma l""crunch/swoosh"" footsteps...like fast, running, baby footsteps on concrete...not grass...it was weired...me and shane didn't say anythign but we both heared it...I finally mentioned it...I noticed Trent and Matt were fucking way across the graveyard so it couldn't of been them, then shane said he heared them too...they were close....but I wasnt scared at all...Shane seemed concerned, but this ws <i>before</i> his turn so he couldn't of been scared...

Shane took the recorder and it was his turn...he personally called names from graves...and although it (on the recorder--we played it at trent's later that night) didn't sound like words, it sounded like humming, or a long sigh...very long sigh...

Also While it was Matt's last turn, There seemed to be a sound like a Car starting, several tiems except it was very low, repetitive, and no one heared it while we were actually there...and it sure as hell wasn't anywhere near us at that time...

All these actions or sounds we heared always followed a question...we aksed about 50 questions and only 2 maybe 3 were affected...I know It may seem like I'm making a big deal out of it...but this is the first time I'v done soemthing like this...and believed it...

-------------------------------------------------------------

I home now, wondering about tomarrow....I hope I get to go somewhere...

Problams occur, reoccur, resolve and reoccur once again....as is the life of <i>me</i>...

I need someone to help me...I can't rely on pills the rest of my life...I hate it...THe only time I'm happy is on them and I feel horrible after words...I want someone to help me... feel...Feel...that's the perfect word...

Thanx

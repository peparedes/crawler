CHAD.


Wow, I've been simply amazing lately.
I honestly can't put exactly how I feel into words because it's beyond what I've ever felt.

Ahh<3, I can't wait til Chad comes home, this relationship will be full of cute things and many memories.

I could go on and on and on; it would take too long though.:]

But I think you get the way I'm possibly feeling, Chad is everything I've ever wanted, I'm so glad we met.
<333.

"event","So..i haven't really updated..just stupid short entries..this is gonna be real though..so anyway..recapping my week...basically...a lot of school and work...i decided i'm gonna become a supervisor at UPS..after all ""supervisor"" on the resume looks better than ""package handler""..School is the usual..go to class..listen..take test..get an a on the test..cause i am that damn good...which reminds me of a story..so the first couple of weeks of class..i wasn't showing up to bio..then i eventually do...and we're doing a lab..and i'm all dressed sexy (cool shades, cool shoes , sweet suit and new tatoos (no tatoos at at all actually))..so we're getting supplies..and this girl standing next to me..leans over..and whispers ""i have a huge crush on you""..so i'm like ""xcuse me""..and she's like ""oh..just talkin to myself""...when she clearly wasn't talking to herself..so as we're walking out of class..she hands me a piece of paper with her number...i don't know if i'm gonna call it tho..we just talk in class...i dont know if i'm interested or not..Then this other girl i met in my business law class - cute girl - and she works at a bmw dealership..the same dealership where i know someone who works there as a salesman..so we had something in common already..we had a pretty decent conversation going..then i'm walking her to her car..and it's a damn ""rice racer""...115 hp of raw mean muscle!!!! grrrrr....i dunno..i don't wanna judge people by their car...but it's just the first impression that you get...but whatever..this girl seemed like she was diggin me..so we'll see how it turns out..i dont know what to do bout girls..i'm really focused on other things now...1)transferring 2)work 3)martial arts- we got an amazing team this semester..hopefully we won't get our asses kicked...actualy..i lied..girls are always at the top of my list..i love girls..especially girls that like me..but anyway..fast forward to today....i woke up..went to take my econ test....finished in 35 minutes (we had 3 hours for it) ..got it graded..98 (made a stupid mistake!!)...then went home...watched a movie..worked out..watched a movie..worked out..watched a movie..worked out...so..movies watched today 1)ghostbusters..2)school of rock..3)soul man..4)Mighty Ducks 1 and 2(got the box set..but d3 sucks!)...alrite..that's all for now..more updates as i get more news...and that's the way the cookie crumbles..peace....P.S..i really do like girls...even if i'm not interested in a relationship...just talking is fun...it's good to get a different point of view once in a while..that's all"

"event","So a little update I guess is in order :)
Summer school starts tomorrow so I'm pretty excited. I have about a semester and a half till I can  complete my transfer to UCLA. Pretty exciting folks. But the complete boredom of San Francisco has finally slapped me in the face. 
Kipling Brand Ambassador for the West Coast-sweet title huh. Yeah- so it gets better. I choose my own hours, have a cushy little salary and get hella free swag all the time. Be jealous.
After about 5 weeks of summer there is Comicon :-) Although Clive Owen may not be there this year its totally worth going to again :-)Oh, plus we're staying in a 4 star hotel. Sweet.
Travis is Travis, eh. its all good.
My family got a puppy and its freaking ADORABLE-its name is Molly and its a golden retriever puppy.
Bioshock is pretty fun.

I abso-fucking-lutely HATE San Francisco.
The people here think they are gods gift to all, but in reality they are a waste space and time.
Complete fucking idiots. Not only are they aesthetically disturbing but they are mental cases to top that little dysfunctional sundae. 
The count down to backpacking is about 5 weeks.
5 weeks to many, I think. 
I think after I get back there is going to have to be some academic relocation because I cant fucking breathe in this smoggy, time-consuming rats nest that people leave their hearts in. what the fuck ever."

"event","There is a mix between butterflies and complete emptiness in my stomach. 
I'm really not sure why.
There is nothing wrong in particular, I just have this feeling that I need to branch away from everything I'm attached to. School, San Francisco, California, the united states.

So i went home this weekend and it was amazing. after having to work sooo much and having just passed midterms the break was just the right thing to lift my spirits. I went on a walk all through El Granada-the woods, the beach and even the park. The entire time I had this little gushy feeling in my tummy and old past times and past walks and days came back to memory. I'm hoping this was all provoked from just walking through but I dont know anymore...
I thought about around 2 years ago just lying down at the park and relaxing with alex and chris. The heart felt walks we used to go on and how I was at ease with everything. family, school, work and love. 
This walk also reminded me off someone I lost contact with and that as left a little whole in my heart, i know corny but whatever. I figure spieling it out might help a little bit. 
After a year and a half friendship then dating a series of events happened that wrecked a wonderful thing. I'm gunna take 99% of the blame right now becasue of my inability to trust and inability to let go off stupid little problems. Two weeks after I moved out to san francisco to a new apartment, not really near my family and not knowing anybody there chris and i got into a tiff and decided to break up-it didnt last long becasue later that night he came to my house and spent the evening with me. But the thought of being left totally alone in a city that i felt i didnt belong to made me feel absolutly terrible and weaker then i had ever felt before. Although we were back together i just assumed he would break my heart again in a day, week or another month..who knew? all i knew is that i couldnt handle the hurt again. I became partially numb. The visits to half moon bay and his visits to san francsico became fewer and far between during the next few weeks becasue of school and work schedules, it was understanding. I was suddenly thrown into the college life that i was completly not used to and met travis. Clearly after drinking a little to much one evening we kissed and becasue of guilt and feeling like an absolutly terrible person I tried to break up with him the following day when he came to visit. He was to good for this. What we had was to good for this. I couldnt handle feeling so rotten inside and for months regreted that night and wished i had just gone back to hmb but couldnt. I wanted so terribly just to crawl back into my old bed, in my old house and cuddle with the love of my life with a wonderful cup of easy gas station coffee.
For the next few weeks I hungout with travis more and more(basically crying a lot) and we becasme closer. It sounds really stupid but i just needed someone to talk and relate to and it just went from there. as the months and months flew by we started dating-probably the worst few months of my life. I was still completly heart broken and had this guy over all the time that i had no emotional attachment to, to be honest. 
To be even more honest, the emotional attachment has not grown an inch more since then. Im not going to lie-I do care for him after 14 months of dating..(and i count the dating thing from the day we met/became friends..we didnt really date date for like 2 months. we are like friends that have hanky panky from time to time. I have just always wanted to bond with him the was i used to with chris but it just wasnt there. Im still hoping...but as time goes on it just feels like more of a waste of time.
I dont know why this still bothers me after about a year but it just kinda still does. There are so many memories that i just cant forget about. The letters, the hundreds of dollars spent on little coffee breaks, and the 'nuggles. lol. one day of that was just worth more then a month with travis. 
Well, i feel a wee bit better about getting that off my chest into words but whatev. Its bettere to of loved and lost then never to of loved at all. :-p
back to work."

"event","So, the last few weeks and months have actually been great. I am on Deans list in a double major and two minors and doing really well. Credit-wise I'm actually a junior. 
Via work I have two jobs. Visual Lead at the Downtown Centre American Eagle and sales rep at ThermaClear. yay being over worked and underpaid.  
After a few tumoltuous months, Travis and I are actually doing great. We have officially been living together for about 6 months. He is the manager at the Metreon Rosetta Stone(which basically i get to use all the time for free) and a full time student. Its strange, though, this is the first relationship that let me feel as though I dont hae to babysit my significant other and actually get spoiled to tears.Each day together actually means something versus just lying around and watching family guy all day and eating gas station food.He just bought me a diamond frenship and promise ring :-)
We have a little pitbull terrier we adopted two weeks ago, named rocco, and all the roommates absolutly love him.
Deeba and I won a free trip to Vegas through work and are super excited. Its in about 3 weeks. Then abdul, trav deeba and i are going to germany over winter break. 
Everything in life is running smoothly. I havent got to visit home though in months due to being so busy but my family comes up once a week or so to go get coffee or lunch. I really do appreciate and love them.
We got a ps3 and a wii. Awesome. But i am still addicted to n64 marioparty or pokemon puzzle.
anyways, i guess this journal is a nice theraputic way to do stress.

The vacation, as expected, was god-awful.
My parent(and by parents-i mean my mother) hated Travis.
Travis hated my mother.
Since I have gotten back miles and i have been in even closer contact. Yes, Im a jerk but this whole vacation made me see that Travis and I were just a fling that went on waaaay to long. 
School started last week. I have decent classes. I think I will do very well >.<
I have a big ob interview which i am very excited for tomorrow. 
Assiistant managing position.
Ive started working out and eating right-which, to be honest, i havent done for years. woot. 
I feel good about how i look and feel for once.
meh. Im bored right now. Gunna go study, do homework, jog and see miles.

"event","So todays the start to a new end.

I dont know what i feel towards travis anymore. i think i love him some days but other days the sight or thought of him detests me. we have been living together for some months now and although it has perks there are also huge faults as well. I like my freedom and wantingness to go out and explore the city-sometimes with just my ipod and a cell phone but he doesnt like o appreciate that. wtf. But besides all of this we are going to spain and England for 3 weeks in about 2 days. There is a huge dilema running through my mind though. 
I met this guy named Miles.
I like him.
I mean to say-i REALLY like him.
We get along so beautifully but I feel like a complete asshole when i then see travis. But there is an unadulterated passion i can feel between miles and i that feels impossible to ignore. Either way i just feel like poop. I have not had that ""oh i cant wait to see him"" kind of childish giddyness for a very, very long time. although for the most part i can say i care for travis dearly-he smothers my freedom which makes me care for him less sometimes. I do blame myself though for letting this get so bad. 
When he speaks of the possibility of marraige his eyes glimmer and shine and my heart drops to the bottom of my stomache. One of the reasons i broke up with a previous boyfriend was because the thought of settling down at such a young age terrified me beyond the point of truly loving somebody. 
I dont know what to say. It seems like i drag myself in to this spiraling mess on my own.
Im going to hangout with miles again-but Trav is going to be at work. *sigh*
I am an asshole.

I am still currently unemployeed becasue i am extremly hot headed and suck at life.
I still need to pay for school and pick classes.
I am on the Deans List but am really lazy these days so it means nothing.
We are going to be having 5 people living in our house so we can afford rent. re-fucking-diculous.
im out."

"event","I absolutely feel like screaming and pulling out my hair...
I'm so fuckin sick of everything. I wanna get out of here.


First off-school I have a minimum of like 5 hours of homework a night.EVERY NIGHT.wtf.I consider  myself a tenacious person..but gah. I'm SEVERAL thousand dollars in debt do to school loans but don't have the means and  or time to actually get a job that can help me pay $700 a month for rent  and all the other bills and such. To add to that, my academic adviser informed me that I have to take summer school. >.< basically meaning spending MORE Money and having LESS time to make it.

Secondly, My family is driving me off the fucking walls with ""not being home enough"" or not doing ""family type things"". Not only do I have to against my will go to Spain with them at the end of the summer(again-less money making and in a country I detest) but I can't please them. I'm constantly being domestically harassed about phone bills and text messages, then about dental and medical bills...GRR.And on top of all of this-i need to get a new cell phone and plan because my MOTHER is kicking me off of her FAMILY PLAN..bitch.

Thirdly, Today is Travis and my ""6 month anniversary"". Thats an entirely new bag of worms.It's supposed to be a wonderful milestone-but its not.. So, I was just told that instead of joining me in summer school-he's of to Israel for like 6 weeks. *sigh* I don't even think I'm really to bothered by it but even after 6 months I truly cant decide how I feel about him. Even though we are totally monogamous..I still just don't have trust in him and with out trust there can be no love, c'est la vie.I just want to truly care about Travis but in my hearts or hearts I can only see heartbreak at the end of this.I just have this hallow, sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach.

Fourthly,
Theres Deeba. Deeba is an interesting roommate but because we are so similar we get on each others nerves...A LOT. Half of our classes are together.A cute idea...in the short run, a very bad one in the long run. She has her ex-boyfriend calling at 4 in the morning and since we share a room he believes that since she won't answer her phone that it's a brilliant idea to call MY CELL PHONE and to wake her up. gah. We actually have a fourth roommate moving into our place on Saturday so hopefully that will lighten the atmosphere around here..she seems sweet.

To conclude, this is thee most hopeless I've ever felt. I can't really talk to anyone who really gives a damn.Its like I wake up and go to sleep everyday and night and just feel hollow and emotionally void. I just want to run away and have another life..this was not how i expected and wanted college to be like.

I'm just so lost..:-/"

Via October, there has been a few adjustments and readjustments in my life, some good and some bad. Lets begin, shall we: <br /><br /><strong>-Chris.</strong> ::dramatic-flopping-over-onto-the-floor-sigh:: He is simply amazing. There aren't many ways I can explain and emphasize our relationship enough. This Saturday is our 1 year anniversary. <em>1 YEAR</em>. jeeeeze. It really is astonishing how we have gotten along this last year with hardly any problems (not complaining by any mean). He just makes me appreciate how wonderful and loving people can be. If I dont say it enough, I realllly (heartfeltly) love&nbsp; meine hausputzfrau! <br /><br /><strong>-School</strong> ::another-dramatic-flop-onto-the-floor-although-not-as-glorified::Well, graduation is in June and as far as i know I am good to go. Im not quite sure what the count is now, but I assume around a handful or two relatives from England are coming down for that week. *w00t* Im just a little too ecstatic to get out of hmb.&nbsp;Then next semester im of to SFSU which brings up another topic...<br /><br /><strong>-Moving Out</strong>. ::a roar golf claps from around the room:: yes, yes. Moving out. Big deal. But when you live in such a wee town with my Family-it is a huge deal. Hopefully, the date is End of August or begining of September, but Chris and I are planning on renting <em>our own little</em> shady appartment in San fran or Daly City area. Cool 'eh. You see- this technically can work-although my love can burn water...he can cook. AND its edible. 1 necessity down. Next-I can clean and mend things..im slowly learning to be more and more domestique as the days go by. 2nd necessity down. and the 3rd...::drum rolls, please:: we both HAVE jobs. That hardly ever happens. lol. we're good to go...:-)<br /><br /><strong>-Paris.</strong> After traveling with my family this summer, Chris and I are planning a trip to Paris from August 3rd + like 1 1/2 weeks. It should be spectacular. Ive taken several years of french and through a brutal osmosis, Chris is learning quite a bit of it. Plus we have both been to Paris before and we both loved it.&nbsp;There are &nbsp;two options, (though the second is obviously more idea):<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Each save up for the tickets and use either my parents timeshare or stay in youth hostals. Not to shaby..but quite exspensive. Then theres the metro passes, museum passes, food, souvenirs...Chris doesnt have a U.N passport either so it might be even more exspensive to take the trains around. &gt;EEK&lt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -SECOND OPTION. The French scholarship I have been drooling and slaving over for the last week. Basically there is a contest going on with the french embasy in San fransisco were you have to do this art-history questonairre and do an essay. THIS essay has driven me insane but is now finished. You are basically being graded by native french speakers and they decide whose is the most creative and well-written essay.&nbsp;I have given my&nbsp;Pre-rough draft to my French teacher who said there were a few gramatical mistakes but overall actually has quite a good chance of winning in her opinion..Im bringing it tomorrow to the Belgium girl(native speaker) to look it over then sending it out. <strong><u>But anyways...</u></strong> if i win, it pays for tickets, place to stay, food, shiny-things and all the metro and art museums you could possible ever want to see. Amazing , huh.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, for the time being this is going to have to be it. There are a few more things here and there, but oh well.&nbsp;<br /><br />TTFN<br /><br /><strong>p.s</strong>.&nbsp; J'aime mon stupefier, l'petit ami pensif merveilleux et aimable qui s'avere justement etre l'amour de ma vie.<br /><br />&lt;3 Jenny"

"event","*sigh* here we go again. School; oh what joy. Today was uncannily long. The moment I got to Broadcasting this morning (Dumbass) Olsen made me take a ""hands-on"" test which basically was a waste of about fifteen minutes.Iwas just screwing around on the sound system and key joint board doing the EXACT same thing I do everyday; but somehow today was some kind of exception. whatever. Then in math and us history we basically did pointless buisy work just so our lazy-most-likely-still-hungover-""teachers"" dont have to do much but sit on there arrogant, ignorant pedistools and bitch. French today was a piece of cake (mmm...cake) and English wasnt to bad although i do have quite a bit of studying to do. Lunch was pretty laidback-me and kenny walked around and munched on our chewy bar. yummy. I basically was asleep in chemistry so i have no idea what we did and in art i got to work on my geisha a little bit more. Instead of practice today I had to go get my knee taken a look at. A shit load of fun if I do say so myself. After the doctorknocked at my knee about 100 times and asked ""Does THIS hurt?..good"" we finally established my knee STILL FUCKING HURTS. Lets praise these dumbass guys and there fucking B.A.'s in wacking peoples knees and sticking thermometers in there mouths...and while we're at it lets pay them hundreds and hundreds of dollars too. Well, I am pretty excited to get home. for the last two days; basically for about 13 hours put together; I've been painting on the canvas I got for christmas. It kicks ass and I am pretty proud of it thus far. I set up a flood light about my easel and have all my acrylics and oil paints spread all over. Its really quite lovely to just sit in my room and paint for hours on end. well, thats about it. oh. Its official weigh-ins week AND we have a shitload of tournaments coming up so yay.no food. :D. well, i hope you feel better manda panda. -jenny"

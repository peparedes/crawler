"event","Well, I have officially left school...And the prom last night was amazing :)

It was at Kelham Hall in Newark, and the place is gorgeous. From the outside it looks a bit like the castle in Beauty and the Beast, and inside it looks like Hogwarts! lol.

Everyone looked so great, very different to seeing everyone in jeans and t-shirts! Some of the girls looked like super-models or princesses in their dresses, and the guys all looked so grown-up in their tuxedoes (not that they acted it, though...)

We started with a drink while we waited for everyone to arrive, and marvelled at everyone's outfits :) Then we all had to take our seats for the meal. We had place-names and everything :) hehe. Our table was nice, some of our closest friends on there, plus a couple of teachers. The meal was alright, but I don't think anyone liked the main course! lol.

Next came a VERY funny speech from the head of 6th form, Mr K...he managed to embarass/shame at least half of us in it...luckily I escaped ;) hehe. Even one of the english teachers was embarassed, though not as much as Tash, who was mentioned for having a huge crush on him (despite being in his 50s). Lol.
Sam Allison, our head of council, gave us a hilarious speech that let us rememeber some of the funniest (and most drunk) times we've enjoyed over the last 2 years or more, letting s remember the socials, the drunken throwing-up, the odd couples and even our resident rats - the ones we came to love and will miss the most (ok, maybe not, but by the end they were part of th 6th form family) :)

Then the music finally started! Ok, so none of us would dare enter the dancefloor for the first 45 mins or so because of all the embarassing, older members of staff that were jigging there...so it was trips to the bar and watching the teachers with awe as they strutted their stuff on the dancefloor...what that stuff was I'm not sure, but none of us dared get any closer to find out...
After watching what I think is the most entertaining (yet disturbing) display I've ever seen whilst at that school, the teachers finally cleared the floor, knackered, and the good music was put on for us students. And we danced the night away! We had our theme song played about 3 times throughout the night Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now') which was cool, and some very cheesy requests were made in between. There was a big group dance at the end where all of us squished ourselves onto the tiny dancefloor to drunkily sway to the slow songs, as thats all we could do by that time :)

All in all it was a fantastic evening. There were a few tears at the end, but also a lot of laughs as we all remembered the great times we had together. If I said I won't miss it all I'll be lying...big-time. They're a great bunch, our year, and that was our last night all together. Which sucks. But hey, the memories are still there. And what bloody great memories they are :)

So, thanks Class of 2005, we rocked!...And we were the best god-damn 6th form that school has ever seen!! :D"

<P>What can I say? It was AMAZING!!!</P>
<P><lj user=""teylaminh"" /> has written a pretty lengthy account in her LJ that covers it, so just a few points...</P>
<P>First of all, was great to meet Bex, Miranda and Steve, who are all just as crazy as me when it comes to Most Haunted, lol.</P>
<P>The whole evening was very surreal, especially at the start, but seeing The Sofa let it finally start to sink in that we were really there. Then spotting Richard Jones helped too. But the first real shock for me was Karl's first (albeit very brief) appearance during rehearsals...So cool!</P>
<P>The whole rehearsals thing was very funny, particularly with Richard Woolfe doing impressions of everybody, the funniest being a very squeaky-voiced Yvette, who snuck up behind him during the process...Cue Shock No. 2. Yvette Fielding on the set, only a few metres infront of us. Very cool indeed.</P>
<P>But the best shock was No 3...Karl, Yvette and Derek all walking down the ailse at the start of Access All Areas, all of about 6 feet away from me. Oh. My. God. That nearly killed me! lol.</P>
<P>Overall it was a fantastic evening, during which I learnt some very interesting facts...</P>
<UL>
<LI>David Bull really is a *damn* good-looking man</LI>
<LI>Karl's hands really are that gorgeous</LI>
<LI>Julian's ears really are *that* big</LI>
<LI>Yvette Fielding is even more beautiful in the flesh than when you see her on TV...OMFG ;)</LI></UL>
<P>And yes, she really is that foul-mouthed, even when she's not terrified, as her remark to Richard Woolfe proved - ""You're a shitbag."" LMAO.</P>
<P>Yup, that's about it for now :) Still really too squeed up to say anything else about it at this moment in time :D<BR></P>"

"event","Well, yesterday was a...different day. Went to meet a couple of friends and ended up modelling some beautiful role-play clothes for Caroline. That woman really is talented. My favourite was probably the silky purple Egyptian-style outfit, very nice. That or the gorgeous green velvet dress I tried on first (which I nearly fell down the stairs in considering the size of the train on it, lol, great start). The mini 'photoshoot' only lasted about half an hour, but then we got talking about role-play and Caroline explained a lot of it to me in a bit more depth and showed me some photos of past events. All looked like a lot of fun, and not just because of the amount of beer tents ;)

Also, the couple have two of the most adorable kids, of which Summer - a 5 month old baby girl - is the cutest little girl I've ever seen :) She'd make anyone rethink not having children (ok, so maybe I wouldn't go *that* far, lol).

So, because I ended up staying at Lee & Caroline's way later than expected, it was 11pm when I got home, so didn't get to mark Beltane in any particularly special way. About the closest thing to it was singing 'Queen of the May' at random points throughout the day, which I'm sure would have annoyed the Goddess rather than appeased Her, lol. Ah well, was nice to spend the day with a Pagan family though I suppose. 

However, because of the amount of alcohol consumed throughout yesterday evening, I now don't feel too great - totally didn't think about how it would suit (or not suit) the pills i'm on...let's just say I've learnt not to take them and drink in the same day, ugh. 

Today, after about a 2 hour fiasco with the bank holiday screwed up buses, I finally got to see my dad. All is well that end, and it was nice to see him (it's getting very hectic these days to see him, with his work, my stuff). Enjoyed chatting to him and making the most of the nice weather...that is, until it decided to piss it down with rain. Ah well, can't win 'em all I guess.

All in all a great weekend :)"

"event","...And all in one day. 

Here's me thinking it was a lovely day for a walk yesterday, so I decided to go down to the old village I used to live in, to sit in the small garden there. Yet, along the way...

Incident #1: An old guy on a bike rides by me, scaring the life outta me, and says ""Ah, cover up for fuck's sake"". Excuse me? I just looked at him gone out as he rode off, then looked down at what I was wearing. Ok, first of all, it was a relatively warm day, so I had on what I thought to be a nice summer outfit...This consisted of a skirt that actually *touched* the floor (so no legs showing), and a top with long sleeves - one of those cropped belly-top things that wasn't really low down either (so, no boobs showing). Huh?! I had a little of my midsection showing, and I get told by some pissing guy to cover up?! I walked past 3 pubs on my walk, and there were girls sat outside every one of them with skirts on that looked more like belts and tops that were practically bras. If I need to cover up, then what do they need? Shooting? And this from a man too old to be wearing the skin-tight lycra...*thing* he had on. Fucking ignorant git. 

So, finally got to the garden I was heading to, and was enjoying sitting in the sun, when...

Incident #2: Is it that obvious that I like girls? Oy, I was sat on this bench, and I could see some guy looking over at me from the other bench in the gardens, and eventually he came over. He asked me my name, and we chatted a bit...then he asked me for my number. I said I didn't think so, thanks; then came the ""You have a boyfriend?"" ""No"" ""Why? You're 18 and beutiful..."" and all that crap. I laughed it off, saying I wasn't interested. Then there it was - ""Ah, so you like girls, not men is that it?"" WHAT? Did I say that; no. Either I naturally give out the ""hey, I'm into girls"" vibes just by sitting there, or he's just that full of himself that me being gay *must* be the reason I don't wanna date him. So, cya Tony. Arrogant twat. 

Wow, what a nice day it was. Can't even go for a peaceful walk without getting weirdos talking to ya."

<P><EM>Oh, yes, and about ten seconds before my bus turned up, the MHLive ticket people rang back.&nbsp; Apparently - get this - we're on the guest list!!&nbsp; Dude!&nbsp; GUEST LIST!!&nbsp; We're MHLive VIPs!&nbsp; So that left me grinning stupidly all the way home. :D&nbsp; Word to the wise: fangirling definitely works. :D</EM></P>
<P>Yup, plus my supervisor made me smile when she told me I'd definitely got the day off for it...all looking good so far!</P>
<P>VIPs? Man, this is too good to be true!! lol. Not that I'm complaining... ;) *begins to count down days til MHL...*</P>"

Not a hell of a lot - been off school for 3 days now with what I'm sure is food poisoning from a dodgy Chinese...ugh. So, my days are totally screwed up and I keep thinking it's the weekend, lol. 

Back to school and work tomorrow though, which is...boring. Can't believe there are only 6 weeks of school left though, then it's over forever!! (Well, after the exams...and the results - but then that's it! Yay!)

Am slightly worried now that work are gonna turn to me tomorrow and say that they messed up or something, and I can't have the 7th of May off - that would really throw a huge spanner into the works :( I'm so close to going to Most Haunted Live now, and I will hate Morrisons superstores nationwide if they take that away from me because of one measley Saturday off *glares at store*

Anyhoo, enough of my paranoid work ramblings; off to get something to drink."

Your heart burns for love
My soul burns for blood
I'll take you, I'll break you
I'll crush you, I'll break you
If you want me, I'll need you
I'll kill you, feed from you
I'll take you down that road
That leads to destruction
Come and take a walk with me
Where the angels fear to tread
Kiss the flame, feel the pain
In the furnace of our love
I can't feed my hunger
Your youth makes me younger
I'll hurt you, desert you
Turn your dreams to nightmares
I'll cheat you, I'll eat you
I'll maim you, I'll drain you
Come to me, come to me
To the dark side where love sleeps
I'll hurt you, you'll love me
I'll scratch you, I'll cut you
You'll kiss me, then miss me
I'll laugh at your torment
I'll have you, and own you
Be hard and cold to you
I'll be your dark angel
I'll be your worst nightmare

Big Mistake.

I've had this Ink Suk CD for over a year now, and I'm only really listening to the words of 'Love Spell' properly for the first time, and hey, it's pretty cool :) Don't know why that has any relevance to anything but hey. Just me being random as usual.

"event","At least it will make my other entries seem interesting hehe.

So, after voting yesterday and nealy collapsing in a fit of excited laughter, smeg and I went to the gym and then watched movies (thank you by the way for tolerating my insanity).
I then proceded home to watch the election results. I resigned myself to accepting a conservative government, and just hoped against hopes that it was a minority (meaning they have less power to enact real big changes). Which occured, so I am a little relieved. Unfortunately my good friend Mr. Carr did not retain his seat as MP of Halton which I was fairly disapointed about. He is a really good guy (he played hockey too!).

So I sincerely hope you ALL voted. It is such an important thing to do. So many people around the world either a) cannot vote at all b) their vote is worthless because all the election results are rigged or the military intervenes and nullifies the results or c) people are harassed and coersed into voting for a specific person against their will. And it was only 80 ish years ago that even in Canada, women could not vote! So those women that endured harassment and public persecution for the right to vote would be disapointed at all the women today who don't vote.  

It is such a blessing that we can actually exercize a right that so many others don't have in this world. To ACTUALLY have a say in where our country goes. To those people who think they threw their vote away, no vote, EVER is wasted. Parties may get more recognition next time, be it in the form of official party status (and the finances that come with it) or a spot in a debate or just recognition in the community that this party/person is worthy of representing some people. And to all those naysayers (funny word) who think that their one meager vote doesn't count or doesn't matter, I must protest.

28 498 - my vote was one of those, and however insignificant that seems, if I adopted the belief that my vote doesn't matter, and the rest of the 28 497 people adopt that belief as well, then the voice of the FEW would govern our lives. 

Only when everyone speaks do we have a democracy, it of course means rule of the many (literally) - do you want to be the many? or the ""others"" (which is a scary movie by the way).

All for now..."

"event","I'd list the flaws I see when I look in the mirror, but I know everyone will just reply sayign tahts not true, you're smart and pretty etc.

So there goes that line of attack. 

How about I begin to describe the things that ARE going well in my life as of now:

- cheese

(why is it alwys cheese? I have a bizarre obsession with it)

its the kind of thing that when peopel say: say the first thing that comes into your mind, I would say cheese

I don't know why I conjure up these crappy feelings right when I have an important project due. (Tuesday)

I guess its just the stress of worrying I will fail it that makes all of these other insecurities surface.

So I sit here and drive myself slowy insane and try not to sleep or eat in hopes that everything will go away if I outlast it all.

And then I eventually go to sleep and wake up fine in the morning and then kick myself several times for not snapping out of it earlier and doing my work. 

I really have no idea what my point is here.
I don't know much of anything.

You can try to tear me down, beat me to the ground, I will see you screaming. 
(That is from the song I'm listening to)

I don't want tomorrow to come, because it can only be worse than today."

"event","I don't know what to write about. Other things I don't kno:

- how to do half of my computers work
- what sort of mood I'm in

Refering to the second one, I am not sure if I am content, or angry/upset. It is weird. It is some form of mixed up blurr between anger and being fine. This may explain my freakout yesterday steph (sorry about that by the way and thanks for being so awesome!)

With that said, here are the things that may be contributing to my confusion:
- school (I am really really concerned about failing/not being good enough)
- family (my parents are being weird, which kind of ends today cos my dad is going on another one of his 8 month trips away from here which I'm very glad about) - is it bad that when he came back from being away for 4 months all I thought was why can't you leave again? meh
- so yeah I'm not really sure what is contributing to my sense of intangibility
- i like point form

that is all i have to say
so i will write more story"

"event","I had a whole long entry about why I hate wal mart and a wide assortment of other neat facts (one of them is really really interesting and funny) but at the moment it is not appropriate, why you ask? It is because people are thoughtless and hurtful. 

What is it with people, what makes everything a competition? We always have this inate desire to prove to others a)how great we are b) how screwed we are or c) generally trying to show that we're better than others.

This is the reason for fancy cars, plastic surgery and senseless complaining.

How can you tell when people intend to hurt you or not? Do they do it without shame or a smile on their face? Or do they just recklessly trample all over your feelings?

Don't ever ask me again why I don't tell people anything, or share things because this is what happens. It has happened before and I swear it will not happen again.
I don't even know why I'm writing this, it doesn't even matter."

I was writing the following at the end of a reply to stephs journal and figured it should be its own entry so blah>


I also have no job and even my attempts to apply for jobs are failing: 1. the fax wouldnt send my resume so i threw the GIANT 30 pound fax on the floor then my dad came and sent them (in the wrong order mind you but he sent them) 2. I e-mailed my application to this AWESOME sounding municipal gov secretary job and it sent back this morning saying that the human_resources didn't have an account on the email server. The deadline was yesterday.

In addition to that my face broke out again. Badly. I don't on any accounts want to go back to school in September. I hate school and have no desire whatsoever to do any work. Ever. At all. 

So I'm thinking that considering I can't do school and can't get a job, I should just commit suicide now. *jumps out of 4th story"

"event","Wow, it's late. I hate marketing. Damn. i just remembered I have to print this stupid assignment out. I'm not making much sense. I have to wake up in 5 hours. Should be fun. I can't believe this semester is almost over. I can't believe 1st year is almost over. It seems like last week, it was the first day of school. Wow. It's seemed to me that I'v missed things, like things are going by and I'm just standing there watching them sometimes. That's bizarre. I might think that because for the past 3 days I feel like I'm forgetting to do something, I just can't shake that feeling. I'm probably forgetting to think, or breathe, or sleep. I think I might be getting sick. And I'm definitely developing insomnia again. Eh-em, its 2:00 now. I want it to be summer. It feels like it hasn't been smmer for the longest time. I can't remember what summer feels like. It might be because my ""holiday"" last summer sucked, or that it's snowed constantly for the past 3 months. Well kinda. 
I hate the weather. I'm definitely developing a deep hatred for these weather people. They are LIARS. ""Kids, dust off your tahogoboggans because you won't have to go to school tomorrow"" the next day it was sunny, and NO SNOW. Damn liars. My dad was watching it this morning and I wanted to kill the cocky jerk-faced weather guy that was prancing around the screen giving predictions sooo specific he was using hand gestures to describe how much snow there would be. LIKE is he insane? I know NOTHING about the weather and even I know you can't predict snow amounts like that. The more truthful ones give a range (i.e. 5-10 cm pff yeah right!) but this guy...he was practically decimilizing his prediction. Ok, wow, I read in the Champion that its a sign your getting old when you complain about seemingly insignificant things.. Ahah. It's sad that I've written a paragraph about how much I hate weather people and how they are the scum of the earth. It definitely must mean I'm old. 

I changed my room around. Which made me happy. Except that I kept sneezing cos it was dusty. And I made a pile of old clothes to give away. I was breaking out all of the stops in procrastinating this whole ""essay"" thing. I just don't want to do research, I can't find anything relevant. 

Wow, hopefully some mudbloods at Guelph will be petrified so we can have finals cancelled. Or a whole colony of squirrels were slaughtered by a rogue gang of skunks or beavers. I wish there were some skunks (that didn't smell haha Stephs dog) that were like peppy le pew (did I spell his name right?) it would be funny. No, puss in boots. Or dobby. Yes, dobby! AHAH its soo funny that he is soo self-mutilating. ""Iron my hands"" hahah. I like how he wears a pillow case. It's bettter than a paper bag. I forget how that story goes.

but where shall we go?
We could sail downtown
and loiter around.
Or we could sail to the stars
on a plane of choclate bars.
Or take a glass elevator
and land in an ice cream crater.
Make a gingerbread fort
or perhaps a lodging resort.
Then we'll find a map
and have a low carb wrap.
Underneath a cherry tree
we will find security.
And a cotton candy cloud
will call to us aloud.
We will ascend the candy stair
to the phantom's secret lair.
He will serenade us till dawn
due to the length song.
We'll stumble upon a shiny ring
and see so many blurry things.
We'll walk through the glass
to a world that will last.
We have tea and play cards
we're arrested by the guards.
We plead our hopeless case
in this lawless place.
Then the pirates storm the seas
and the hot ones set us free.
We sail to a merry land
of riches and golden sand."

"event","Ok, so Skendrie complains no one has written anything since before Chrismukkah...well 1. she should write something then and 2. its because we're all recovering from an amazing night (Chrismukkah of course). Ok, so I'll write something then, and since I have nothing to write about, I'll write about Chrismukkah. Here goes:
Kendrie, I loved the name card things (with our picture on) and the punch was really great. Oh and Herbert the chicken was pretty good, aside from the fact that he was still partially alive when we ate him (haha, I don't think anyone got sick- was Jodi ok?)And I loved the crackers, how cool were they? I got a bowling set, although I got yelled at for playing it at the table during the prayer time :( 

Oh and our gingerbread houses rocked Yay Jodi, Steph and Denise! It tasted good too. Although there wasn't the obligatory eating too much and getting sick this time (I was able to restrain myself). So, I had a great time. All in all, a GREAT time. It was fun seeing everyone and OPENING PRESENTS. I'm sorry again that I ruined your present Katie. It's the world's fault. So, before I had 0 I Heart Hockey Player Sweaters, then all of a sudden I had 2~!! Do you think that works with boys too? Because that'd be great! Anyways, thanks again Katie. I hope you liked your present Wilson. I got the Sea Monkey things from a store in Mapleview mall in Burlington on the 2nd floor called Hobbies something or other, they had a lot of cool sea monkey things. It was funny that Q got mono (the stuffed animal ahah) and Steph's belly button rings were pretty. I really liked Kendrie's maple leaf blankey it was really awesome. Katie's doll thing scared me. Nat's cd was cool except that they were trying to listen to it whilst I wanted to watch LOTR ROTK EE. Which brings me to that point! There were some LOOOUUUUUD people behind us (I shall name no no names, you know who you are ...and you were supposed to be the parents tsk tsk!). But I manage to get out all of the interesting useless facts I could to Steph, Skenny and Denise. Although I was disapointed I didn't get to tell all of my useless facts...we'll definitly have to watch it sometime so I can tell you all of them Steph. I really enjoyed explaining things to Denise! Oh and I saw Harry Potter 3 last night and I've decided to read the Harry Potter Books (in addition to writing our version Skenny) over the christmas break. Aren't you proud Skenny? I like the hypogris (is that how you spell it?) the bird horse thing anyways. I wish I had one. Ummm... I think I'm going to get something to eat and read... and then watch LOTR so ta ta all. I hope everyone has an awesome Christmas/vaction and I hope everyone gets what they want (I know I will ...World Juniors on Dec 25th mmmmmm *drooling ok ok I've composed myself). We have to get together sometime before school starts and go tahogoboggoning (I spelt that wrong for sure~)"

Maybe it was just the thought that I SHOULD be studying is what was causing my insanity - who knows? Lol anyways, I have one exam left on Monday (which I could care less about. Over the last week, I have seriously began doubting myself and what the hell I'm doing in university.

Erghh and what I hate even more is that I'm complaining about it all the time. Ok must stop! Ok the only good news of the week (well in addition to Chrismakkah) is that my man (yes I dibsed him) (Remy Lavalle, Jacques son for those people who didn't read my last few entries) used to PLAY HOCKEY. Yes, for a team in Paris. How hot is that? Really hot in my opinion. But stay away! Anyways, he was a right winger (the best wing, in my humble opinion) and a good player too.

Umm, yeah what else? I made myself hot chocolate. And I'm trying to relax in my bed. I only got 5 hours of sleep. And I have really big holes in my socks haha. When is it Christmas, I need new socks? My mom would throw them out but I would never, due to the lack of socks that I have. I wonder what time I should leave for class. I'll need an extra 5 minute buffer so I won't slip because I can't walk fast. I'll land on my ass and cry in the middle of campus. It's much easier to mumble, it takes less energy to respond. What the hell is this thing? Is that like a water sprinkler. Zakiah what is that? It's got holes on it. It says do not paint. I wanna push the button. I want to touch it. I have to go to class. Ah Jon. Don't make me go. I don't even know what - oh. I lost my books, again, they're probably still in my bag, from Monday. No they're on the floor. Snaps for Wilson. Everyone is gonna be so confused by this. It is like dialogue of a day in the life of Wilson. Do you think I should take mitts to class? I could go to the bathroom before class but that takes too much effort. Where are my sea monkeys? I'm going to be late, I'm always late. I'll put on my scarf, in preparation for my trek in the snow.

I'm not joking it was so loud everyone looked and was in shock for like 3 minutes and then we all laughed for another 5 minutes. I was really shocked, I thought he saw a scorpion or something and is deathly scared of them. Anyways, our mall trip was good we got a gingerbread house. Remember Katie, Kendrie when we made the gingerbread house- it was funny. Except I was spilling the icing and Nat called me a retard :(. Then I was called gingerbread house illiterate for pouring chocolate sauce all over one side (ahha it looked Terrible!). We fixed it up nicely though. We were laughing our heads off though so it was fun. Then we ate it. Which was fun too. Oh and the other day (was it yesterday? I'm loosing track of time) I was talking to people on MSN and ALL of them just forgot about me (ok it was 2 people but still). Katie apologized but am I an easily forgettable person? I remember in grade 10 I used to go out to lunch with Kristin and Stacy and them and one day they forgot all about me! I'll go cry in a corner. Oh well. Oh and we thought of another thing to add to the ""things no one told you about university list"": sleep is hollow- you can sleep forever and you will NEVER feel well-rested.

Superheros take on Southern Ontario.
*Note: the University of Katies Car is also comparable to the study ship (its education on wheels haha that should be the slogan of the university) Katie, Michelle, Nat, Steph, Kendrie, Amanada and I are trekking across Southern Ontario in Katies boat or U of KC. All of a sudden Mr Neshivich, Ms Mikoleit and
Mrs Fitzimmsons swing from vines and stop our smooth running univerity dead in its tracks. Katie, quickly takes the helm and steers out of the way while slamming on the brakes. Then Michelle C, called for all hands on deck and we all gathered to make a strategy. The band of teachers, or hoodlems as we will
from now on refer to them, gathered their law text books, chalk and fast writing skills and started walking towards us in a sinister manner. Michelle quickyl told Nature Girl to call upon the rain and cause it to fall, and WEPH to shake trees (so leaves fall on them). Natalie then stared at a large group
of (hot) firefighters conviently located right beside our location and their hotness sparked flames which ignited the leaves that fell from the trees. Zakiah then shot pens that were attached to the four corners of a net which enclosed the hoodlems inside. Kendrie then (being the female version of Peter Parker) takes out her camera and snaps a picture of them, which causes them to fall into a deep trance/hypnotsis. She then tells them to walk to the end of the earth and never return! Until next time..."

Clarity, flushed down the toilet (that was cleaned for 3 hours by the new cleaning guy). Someone mentions work and the thought process in our heads: hmm work...work ... work out? no, thats not it, wombat? no, word, worm, no...yeah there's no such entry in our dictionaries. But then again we don't even use dictionaries because we can't spell. And again I'm not making sense. Last night when I was supposed to be writing my essay I decided to take a nap. I fell asleep for a while but then I was awoken by my mom in the laundry room talking really loudly. So after minutes or possibly seconds of trying to find a position where I couldn't hear her anymore, I proceeded to punch myself in the head and went back to sleep. Yes, I punched myself in the head. And yes, it was hard. It really hurt. Now don't ask me why I did this, because I do not know myself. Perhaps I was trying to commit suicide? or perhaps I was trying to knock the sense out of myself. I really don't know. I really cannot wait for Saturday. It will be great. Except for the fact that I will have less than 2 weeks to read all of the rest of my textbooks in order to pass finals. Great finals. 
Episode 2. Attack of the Mall. 
So, us superheros are taking a trip to the Stone Road Mall to buy material for our superhero costumes. They were getting a little skertchy. Zaha drove WEPH, Nature Girl and Princess to the mall. Upon arrival, the mall doors slammed shut and barred themselves. A voice over the loudspeaker bellowed ""You will never escape"". Just then WEPH's purse was pulled by an invisible force into the movie theatres and the doors locked. Pita's began to fly around and their contents spilt all over the floor. Laughing gas began to filter into the mall and reduced the superheros to laughing giddy girls lying on the floor clutching teddy bears in the arms. What will our heroic women do? Nature Girl quickly called upon her friend the periodic table to neutralize the laughing gas. The superheros escaped this attack with only sore sides, but the pitas began to spit hot sauce at the women. Zakiah shot an arrow at the door of the pita place which caused it to shut, she then shot another arrow at the keyhole and it locked. All of a sudden, an army of Laura Secord guy zombies began to eminate from the ice cream place. Princess quickly looked at them and they bowed at her feet. Then the loudspeaker said you won't be able to catch me. Just then the owner of the voice showed himself, he was a squirrel. He ran into a store and locked the door. WEPH then broke down the door, with her massive muscles and Nature Girl got a cage (conviently located in the clothing store next door) and lured the squirrel into the cage. She then took him to an institution for ""Rodants who try to take over the world"". Until next time..."

OK I've decided what I want to do: I want to go on an exchange to a developing country and work there for a semester, or a year. Our TA for world politics went to Sudan with this agency and he sounded so enthusiastic and that is definitely something I would love to do, I just have never thought about it before. I would like to go to somewhere in the Middle East or Asia or somewhere. So I did some research and I can't go with the school (unless I can magically become a grad student). But I can go with some international agency, so I'll definitely look it up. But it will obviously fail because of various reasons (parents, money, not getting accepted and so on). For all of these stupid things you need to have an undergrad degree! Damn the world! The world hates me once again and I'm trying to HELP the world! Wow theres an organization for Environmental stuff, that would be fun. Damn they all NEED an undergrad degree. Masters degree!! Pff, the world is stupid. Theres this one NetCorps that I'd really like to do but NOOO you have to have a degree. OMG I'm soo upset, because it would be awesome because it involves setting up servers and teaching people how to use the internet and stuff. I am in so much pain and Nat is not helping me feel better because Mr. Oh la la is here. Hahah ok now I'm just being bitter. She doesn't care. She asked me what's wrong and then I told her and then she turned back to Mr.More important than Zakiah's breaking down. Oh and stupid HIM came by and he's stupid! STUPID. OMG I found one where you DON'T need an undergrad degree!! OMG it would be amazing. OMG I would be working with a member of Parliament, OMG I want to do it! But the application form is for last year, so there better be one for this year otherwise I will break some things.

But then again its 5 minutes later and I got up to write in this journal...yeah doesn't really make sense eh. Ok the VCR just randomly spat out a video which was quite scary. I thought at first it was Steph's printer printing some death threat or letter saying ""You should go and die, sincerely the world"". Oh gosh. Ok while I was in my half asleep coma on the floor I realized that we are either 1. angry 2. sad or 3. cracked out. Never happy. Nat quite rightly pointed out that happiness is sometimes associated with being cracked out but I pointed out that the happiness is only a by-product of happiness, never just because we are truly happy. I have come to the conclusion that being angry/sad is by far much easier than being happy and it's more common, since you have to feeling happy (hey maybe that's why they call it a feeling, but then that doesn't explain why being angry/sad is easier). Oh well I'm probably not making much sense now am I? Ok so here are my thoughts as to why we are usually more sad than happy: 1. school: no one likes going to class because well for obvious reasons, but school just isn't fun- at all 2. (and the major one) guys! Ok here is the general problem with them: they are attached (and we like them) or they don't reciprocate the feelings. Ok so about the guys being attached, it sucks a lot and that's polite way of writing it. Ok so now I'm just rambling and I don't have anything to say anymore (my stories don't have points usually so blah). I'm done."

This is gonna sound messed up but I miss the sound of the skates scraping on the ice, the whistles, the fans screaming and the music they play in between play. I also miss the goals, the screaming at refs and the sweaty boys. Oh my gosh and the fights. I miss yelling random and nonsensical insults to the opposing team, and sometimes Kaberle and Belak (Goon!). I miss getting all hyped up for the games and jumping on the couch (and its SUCH a good excuse to not do work). And what would be an awesome thing would be to find some other leaf fans to watch games with in Guelph. Oh well damn you world! One more thing you're conspiricizing against me with."

"event","So I get lost today taking a short cut to school. I Hate the country roads, it's not like they NAME them or anything. Anyways I found an awesome space on my random drive through Guelph and it's so pretty I think we need a day trip there...oh no a picnic! 
Chrismakkah (is that how you spell it Nat?) started early today because I arrived at Nats/Stephs/Wilsons room and Santa/Hannukah Harry got me a present! A cookie from Creelman, ok let me describe it: chocolate, with meltey chocolate inside, nuts and marshmallows. Yummy! (Thanks guys you rock...I mean Santa). Anyways it was off the Richter. I'm supposed to be in politics right now but my ""shortcut"" made me late so I just didn't go. I also have a mid term tonight ... I haven't started studying and in fact haven't finished the readings (could be a bad thing eh?) But this is by far more amusing than studying. Nat just told me that all of our ""girls"" (Q, Katie, Jodi, Emma and Kendrie) should have an online journal, which I think would be cool, but I still love getting the girls night email. Steph and I are signing up for vollyball next week so that should be a lot of fun! I might be a bit rusty though but I really love playing so I think I'll get into it really fast. I don't like my schedule for next semester (4 consecutive hours of computers- no thanks) and no less on a Monday! Wow I'll really develop a ""case of the Mondays"" each week with that. But I think I'll find time to play. Considering I don't do work at all (case in point: I'm skipping class and NOT studying right now), I think I'll be able to find time. I'm positive that these bad habits will eventually catch up with me- as of now I do the barest minimum with regards to work and I'm doing about the same as I did in high school (well a little lower but still). So take that Mr. You all are going to fail! (what a great motivational speaker eh?) 
(Word of caution: the following is a pure inside joke that only a few will get, and others will believe I am insane So reader discretion is advised)
Now onto Episode 1: Attack of the Burny lady
Burny Baker is in Creelman cooking up some food (burning it obviously) and she begins to set fire to our Creelman slide. Frantic we run downstairs and out the door. With her sharp thinking, Squish (name subject to future alteration), using her male-controlling powers, makes all the boys in Creelman throw their glasses of liquids on her- unfortunately one (stupid) boy was drinking alcohol so Burny McGrill went up in flames (or in other words - she esploded *and no that is not a typo). Then Nature Girl calls upon the rain to fall, thus quenching the flames (Creelman is safe from harm - so don't worry all you hungry university students). Then we burst through the doors of Creelman (in our hot superhero outfits) as the smoke rises and Burny McGrill makes a run for the door. I hop on my textbook and fly across the room and ala Legolas I shoot her with my penlike arrows in the shoulder. WEPH then punches her under the chin and she is thus expelled (nice pun eh) from Creelman and our lives. 
Until next time..."

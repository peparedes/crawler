"event","<P><FONT color=#ffccff size=2>only one more day until mine and lauren's <EM>six month's</EM>. its insane if you think about it. most would believe that we are sick of each other, but in all honesty, i feel the same way about her since the first day we were together. <FONT color=#ff0000>i still have a crush on her</FONT>. =)&nbsp; in other news, who am i kidding. i dont have other news. i just love her. &lt;33 ..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffccff size=2>the big 1-8 is coming up this friday. wow. im going to be <STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>18</FONT></STRONG>. i can legally go to clubs and buy cigarettes and porn. well ill probably only accomplish one of those three. and its not the clubs or cigarettes. <STRONG><EM>ANYWAY</EM></STRONG>. yea so i dont know this, but lauren is getting my friends together to go to the bees and then a few people to go out and drink afterwards. should be a good time. i hope it is at least. i drank the other night with lauren, farheen, jay, rob, melissa, tyler, and kristin. it was good. they drank, and a few people smoked a bit. but then tyler had a bunch of shit going on with her mom, so she had to go home. we all left, and me and lauren just hung out. it ended up that tyler got her car taken away until next april. =( =(&nbsp;&nbsp; im sorry tyler. um but yea at least we got to spend a fun night together. and whenever tyler needs a ride, she can hop in the red vehicle..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffccff size=2>at work today, i realized something. i really love kids. like, i really really love them. not in a sexual-molester-rapist kinda way, but in a different way. i love teaching them things, and having fun with them and teaching them how to share and play and stuff. i dont know, but whenever im working, and a kid hates me and cries and wont come near me, i find it to be a job of mine to gradually get the kid to like me. like today, there was this little chinese girl at a party and she hated me. she cried and was afraid, but eventually by the end of the party i got her laughing and she hugged me. i felt so accomplished. the second party was for my baby cousin brianna. my mom scheduled for us to come and be dora the explorer for her. brianna is so cute. she was dancing and smiling and walking around and stuff. shes adorable. work for today was pretty cool. and i made a new friend. this girl mikayla or something that goes to newfield. shes friends with frankie and people, so i donno. shes a nice girl..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffccff size=2>after work, i stayed at my cousins party. it was freezing out, and the party was at southhaven park, so me and my family left. i got home, and went to get lauren, and then she came over and we took a nice nap together. we were both really tired. it was nice, laying next to her and sleeping there all nice and warm. she said she couldnt sleep, and just watched me sleep. its those kinda things that get to me. i love it..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffccff size=2>so i heard that billy and rachel arent friends or something? thats <STRONG>bullshit</STRONG>. theyve been best friends for how long now, and they throw it away over something so stupid? its ridiculous. you guys, if youre reading this, just know that you guys are better than that. talk it out and work on it please. i hate to see you guys not talk to each other and shit. i love you both..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffccff size=2>so last night. i was pessimistic. i sat on the computer and looked around at peoples journals and stuff. but theres one journal i cant stay out of. ali's. i dont know why, but i read it all the time. it seems stupid, but i always start from the beginning, because that was when times were good. i read all the great things she said about me, and i read all these comments i left her. i said it once, ill say it again..i miss those days. before i get all ""emo"" and shit, ill stop here..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffccff size=2>so tomorrow..i have gym and then bonnie and thennnnnn public speaking. thats become one of my favorite classes. its pretty cool, writing speeches and shit. i got a 10 out of 10 on my first speech. hell yea. im on a roll. well after that i have work and me and lauren are going to plan out what we shall do for our <EM>6 months</EM> on tuesday. &lt;33&nbsp; well, im off to bed. goodnight world.</FONT></P>

"event","changes.a word that has so many meanings to me. good. bad. beautiful. ugly. painful. heartwarming. ive been listening to tupac all day. well, as long as ive been home. i dont know why. i think about it, and i hate those stupid fucking rappers who talk about dumb shit like their bling bling and pimping hoes. but tupac was pretty different. sure he rapped about drugs and drinking and shit. but he told it like it was. i dont know. i just start thinking when i listen to him rap. and hes definitely not dead. its a hoax..

well today i woke up happy. something that doesnt happen much. but why was i so happy? because i was in the middle of a strange ass dream, when i heard my bedroom door open and i looked over. lauren was standing in the doorway. she just got back from the doctor and her injections she has to get and she wanted to come and hold me as i slept. it makes me so happy to wake up to someone i love. it really does. she laid with me and we watched some tv and stuff until i woke up fully. after i woke up, we ate some breakfast. i made french toast and coffee and stuff. then i got dressed and we went to her house. wolfie is so cute i love that dog. well, we went in her room and watched eurotrip. haha def one of my favorite movies now. and then we came back here to eat dinner and then i took her to work. now im sitting here all bored and shit. im thinking of driving out to montauk just because i have a full tank of gas and just because i can. i donno. i might go hang with katy for a bit while i wait to pickup lauren..

so the other night i spent the night at rob's house. rob temple is awesome. me, lauren, shib, and kelly all hung out on wednesday night and drove around and shit. then shibs dad called and said that her mom is in the hospital. shib, being the ass she is, decided ""well shes gonna be okay lets to get drunk"". nice. very nice. anyway, we picked up rob, got beer, and went to his apartment off portion road. it was cool. we sparked up the joint we rolled, and drank and chilled. we didnt get too crazy, but by the second joint and a few shots later, i got sick and threw up a bit. i was pretty out of it. but lauren took care of me. i remember that night, but i also forgot some parts. i know that at one point kelly and rob and shib tried to get yayo, but the guy screwed them and gave them crushed vikes instead. i dont sniff yay, so i was like uh ill sleep. i was really out of it man lol. but shib and kelly ended up going home later on, so me and lauren slept in the car. we woke up and went to laurens, and slept there. she was nice to me and let me sleep for four extra hours. lol. that night was crazy..

ummm yea sooooo last night me and lauren went to the movies. it was a me and her only day. we saw napoleon dynamite. haha holy shit it was funny. before we went to the movies, we hung out at the lake. it was wonderful. and we also went to the mall earlier that day because we had to find a place that puts things on shirts. at work, we decided to make shirts for all of us and theyre really funny. if i was so say what they were going to have on them, no one would find it funny because they dont know anything about the library peoples. so yea that was cool too..

im trying to set up my darling anthony with the beautiful katy big boobs. i hope this works out. they would look so cute together..

so yea tomorrow night im hanging out with people and my cousin christopherrrrrrr is gonna come too. its funny because me and him NEVER hang out together. tomorrow will be the first time ever and im excited. i always thought he was a big fag and wouldnt want to hang out with me because im ""selden trash"". haha. whatever man..

so apparently i mean shit and people dont know why they wasted their time on me. what did i even say to get that reaction? i surely do not know. was it the ""dig it"" thing? because if that offends you so much, dont say it. dig it? i have a lot of shit i would like to say to you, but i hold it back. why do i hold it back? because i actually respect you. yes i do. the very little respect i have towards you, im trying to keep it there. so telling someone that you hate to fuck off isnt doing very much to lower my self esteem. nice try. so, person who used to care about me and told me that they were in love with me, YOU go fuck off. im done with people like you. have a nice life. and one other thing, if you do anything to my house or anything to someone i knows house, youre going to fucking get it. so back the fuck up and fucking watch yourself.

well anyway im going to be off now. i have some studying to do and parties to crash. peaceouttttt.







i love you babe.
youre wonderful. <3"

"event","i dont know why. why is it that once things are pretty cool and going good, you find out something happened, and it ruins everything you had going. this world sucks ass let me tell you..

 i just spent a lovely night with my love and we watched s.w.a.t. and went to the bees and stuff with kelly ann, jenny ferrari, her boytoy louis, and diannaaa. it was good. i met jenny for the first time and we had a lot of fun at the bees. eating. and whatnot. we saw erin locasio, tyler, mike milillo, and other people. it was wonderful. and then me and lauren went to my house and hung out and then went to her house and talked and such. shes under a lot of stress and i dont know, i just want to help her out and stuff. shes worried about college, and work, and school, and me, and drivers ed, etc etc. its too much for her to handle, but i told her to not give up because i have faith in her. i really do. i believe that shes a strong ass bitch and she can do anything. nothings too much for her to handle. but anyway, i love her so much and we have plans and everything for next year and when we grow up and everything. =) its amazing..

 oh frigin man. saturday night. oh wow. i dont think i was ever that fucked up in my liiiiife. me, kristen, lauren and evan got driven to this kid steve's party so none of us would have to drive home. as soon as we got there, we whipped out the coronas and buds and carried them to the back. there were a lot of people there. me and lauren followed danny and blazed a bit. his stuff kept making me cough, my stuff was better. totally. so yea me and lauren did that and then went in the back and drank a bit. then heather showed up and we blazed with her a bit. and then we all got tired so we slept in danny's van until he woke us home bc he wanted to go home. lol we slept like 2 or three hours. well anyways, we went in the backyard and chilled with kristen and people. we were kinda bored. kristen and erin dabe made up so theyre friends now. a little while later brigid showed up with steph ryan. and then frigin alyssa kinney showed up. i was like HOLY FUCK ALYSSA KINNEY IS HERE. i went up to her and we hugged and talked and stuff. then we all went out to the front yard again bc alyssa wanted to smoke. so we did and got reaaaaaaally messed up. steph ryan was on the phone and shes like ""dammit i want a hit"" and we teased her and shit and were like ""steeeeeeeph you know you waaaaaaaannnt itttttt"". it was such a funny night. i only remember some major things like that and stuff. but i dont remember anything else. lol it was hysterical. alyssa kept doing cartwheels in the road. her and her friend brooke were smoking and pissing themselves. it was awesome. and brigid was just there. i also got to hang with mcintee who i havent seen in a while. i miss that kid and his crazy antics. he said that ""after tonight i quit drinking"" LMAO. yea. sure mike. so yea we got picked up and went home. lauren slept over and we went to bed and woke up and we were stilllll fucked up from the night before. i walked around work not even knowing where i was. it was insane. wow that night was great. good luck in the army steve, youre a cool guy..

 well, things started to suck once i got home tonight. i started looking at peoples away messages to see where they were and i looked at danielles and my mouth dropped. this girl amy from centereach died tonight at about 6.30 pm of cancer. i didnt know amy, but i heard all about her. i read jessee's journal all the time because she was always updating on amy's condition. and i read it tonight when i got home. and i broke down in tears. i couldnt believe it. this girl who stayed so strong for this long, finally passed on. it got me so upset like you wouldnt believe. i kept crying to lauren and then she cried and it was a catastrophy. i know it sounds wierd when someone gets so emotional about someone they dont even know, but it hit me hard. im not sure why. it upset me and scared me and made me so angry all at once. heather called me too and we talked about it. the girl was so young, and she endured so much pain. she held on for as long as she could, and then she just couldnt hold on any longer. the first person i thought of when i heard about it was jessee. i kept thinking of how distraut she much be. im glad i got to talk to her though. and danielle too. danielle is doing worse, or seemed like she was doing worse, than jessee was. i dont know, danielle is a confused girl who needs to figure herself out. i made up a quote that heather stole from me. ""live your life like death is a hypocrisy"". i think im going to try and follow it, because life is really too short to waste if you think about it..

 well im going to go to bed. its gonna be hard to sleep. the past few nights ive been taking soma, but tonight im on my own. bowling in the morning, and then bonnie, and then public speaking. then work. I HATE THAT GOD FORSAKEN PLACE. im gonna be a bartender at the bees when im 18. =)    speaking of, the countdown is 11 days till my 18th birthday, and 8 days until our 6 month. :o*  i love my baby so much. shes my bandaid. <333  goodnight everyone.

"event","college is...college. actually, it's more like, 13th grade. really, it is. my classes are boring. i only know 2 people in my american national politics class, rich atinesse and mike ozer. cool kidds. and i made a friend in public speaking. her names kristin, shes really cool. i had to ask her questions to prepare for a speech on her for wednesday next week. but yea, college is full of newfield graduates. parking is hell because theres no open spots, and i can never get to mythology on time. i go from the islip arts building, to southhampton, which is really in another area, and then i walk from there to my car and then drove around the campus to nicolls road and go to the annex building. this all takes more than 15 minutes, so im late to mythology each day. shitty part is that each late counts as half an absence. so basically, im gonna get dropped from that class unless i find a quicker way to get there. but anyways, yea i see a lot of people there. so far ive seen nick gianinno, jen christoffel, kate rieu-sicart, sean effinger, erin dabe, tonianne altebrando, rick atinesse, mike ozer, sarah koneig, lauren huss, darlene dalba, patterson, lauren merola, and a lot of other people. its insane. im really trying though, ive been reading what i have to read, taking notes, and trying to stay awake, although that part has been the hardest. ill survive though..

tomorrow i have bowling from 10-10.50. should be interesting. after that i have to go to registrar to get some letter and then to get my books. then to fill my prescription, then to get lauren. oh yea, and tomorrow is the skynard concert at westbury. its gonna be fuckin awesome. me and lauren were gonna tailgate and kristen said shed give us beer, but we decided not to. actually, lauren decided not to. damn you a hole. but yea i cant wait, its gonna be such a great time..

so hummmm. the other night me, darkie, and jarret went to the show at the downtown. a bunch of bands played, like sarcasm, hellogoodbye, madison, etc etc, and then hidden in plainview came on. they were fucking amazing. it was so much fun. darkie and jon b went into the pit and hit people with their hardcore dance skills lol. theyre awesome. but yea, i was like touching the lead singers hair and pants and shit i was like OMG IM IN LOVE. it was the first time ive heard them and they are amazing. thank you darkie for introducing me to an amazing band. but darkie almost got into a fight with some kidd. the kidd was crowd surfing, and kicked darkie in the head, so he took off the kidds shoe and threw it lol. hes so dumb. the kid was all like WHAT THE FUCKS YOUR PROBLEM MAN WHAT THE FUCK ETC ETC. douchebag. chill out man, its a show. shit happens. hahaha..

i had a wierd dream last night..but its too long, so im not going to type it here..

so yea i went to work today and theres this stalker guy called the balloon man who keeps asking for me. he wants me or something like that. well, hes kinda scary looking, and the lib has this policy about stalkers and reporting them. i felt bad so i didnt say anything, but lauren told lameras a while ago, and he came back in today and asked for ""kim the librarian"". haha. so squires came up to me and was like ""yo you have to change your name and not tell people your real name""..well not exactly like that, but it was along those lines. so me, lauren, and cait have a new name each time someone asks us our name. im ursula, cait is satan or something, and lauren is nathaniel. lmao. it was good. but yea i actually did work today and it felt so wierd. and squires was being nice to me today. i guess its the change in the weather..

ya know what sucks..when you see someones mom more than you see that someone. perche you ask? well. i work with miss jennifer ciardulli's mother. and her mother is such a sweet person and always says hello to me. its the same old as usual. ""heyyy jens mom""..""hey kim how are you""..""im good jens mom how are you""..""im good""..""hows jen doing""...""shes good, dont see her much because shes never home""...""ahh i see, tell her i said hello"". i dont know, its just funny to me. the girl doesnt talk to me anymore. odd. i guess people just stop talking to me and shit whenever they feel like it. its cool though. im over it. haha. =) ..

mr james doolan called me up tonight and hes going to the beach on saturday. i wish i could attend but i have work from 9 until 1 on saturday morning. =(  but saturday night me and lauren are going to tylers to get trashed. why? because we can. =) haha. if we cant sleep there, im gonna have kristen pick me up because she owes me one. =) =) ..

i talked to ricky the other night. it didn't go exactly as i hoped. i think im going to stop trying with people. ive tried with ricky, ive tried with casey, and ive tried with ali. im done trying. i really am. ive tried too much and if they miss me like they say they do, i think its time they start trying. i mean, i try everyday to convince myself i dont need them, but i do. but then i think, if im doing all the work in this situation, and their doing nothing to work things out, then why do i bother? its obvious no one gives a fuck. so ya know what. im not gonna give a fuck anymore. soooooo im officially not trying anymore. ive done all i could and now its someone elses turn. DIG IT??

well im off to bed. goodnight all.

well isnt she wonderful. =)



well today was eventfull. i had work today, but the first party got cancelled. so nikki dropped me off at home, and then picked me up an hour later to go to the second party. i love doing the character job, i mean i sit there and say how much i hate going and how i dont wanna go and shit, but in the end, it was worth it. i love to make little kids smile. and like, when they see you come in the door as one of the many characters they adore, their eyes light up and a smile runs across their face. and they give you these hugs and these kisses, and they just love who they see. thats the only part that sucks. i get so happy bc im like, wow im making all these kids smile and they love me. but its not like that at all. they dont love me. the hugs and kisses arent for me. they love who im pretending to me. they love barney, or elmo, or mickey, or blues clues..not me. i donno, i mean i like my job and i know its a job, but it just kinda gets to me sometimes. it makes me think way too much..

so tonight i got home from work and showered and such. and then went to drop off kristen and evan at jay hornicks for a partay. who did i see while i was driving back? LARRY LISO. why? BECAUSE I SEE HIM EVERYWHERE. he invited me and lauren to come to the party and come to the beach to drink with him and people. i would have, but i had to drive and i have curfew of 12.30. i picked up lauren and we went to guam to pick up mary, who by the way, sucks at giving directions. =)  we met up with diana and erin and then heather met us there because heather is amazing. =) ...

SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION BUT ITS ABOUT 1 OCLOCK IN THE AM AND I WANT TO LAUGH IN SOMEONES FACE RIGHT NOW FOR REASONS I SHALL NOT NAME..

..so then we ate and such and then me and lauren drove mary home and then stopped by the decosimo residence. we walked in the door and say danielle, roxanne, mama, some other chick and some guy. the guy was drunk off his ass and he made me and lauren pee ourselves. well, we stayed there for a little bit, and then left. i missed that household and that family. im glad i got to see some of them, and im definitely stopping around there more often..

well last night me and lauren went to the beach with a bunch of kids..lets see if i can name them all..patterson, melissa paduano, sam, tommy, larry liso, chris ramsey, some 22 year old, kenny vancour, meghan wright, and some other chick jen (??). we all chilled and drank and smoked and shit. it was relaxing. then someone made a bet with larry to run around someone elses campfire with his pants down. so he did. in return, he got $20 and a triple kiss with me and lauren. people just seem to like that sorta thing. but yea me and lauren went back to her house and she was definitely fucked up. i just laughed at her. then i ended up coming home late and i got a half hour taken off my curfew for the night. but its okay, im over it..

you know what i hate. i hate liars. i hate when people say shit they dont mean just to get your hopes up. like what you ask? like when people say ""i miss you"". you never know if they mean it or not. and i think its kinda fucked up when i really do miss some people and they say ""oh yea i miss you too""..i know they really fuckin dont. they like to fuck with my head. i think thats it. well in case they dont mean it, i just want it to be clear that i am so fucking happy with my life. i have an amazing girlfriend who treats me like im perfect, and i have friends around me who make me smile all the time. im out of that fuckin piece of shit high school, and im going to a college where i probably have classes with people i know. im happy. i am. with only a few things missing, my life is basically complete. its the first time ive been happy in a long time. and it just gets better each day. so to those of you who like to just spit out meaningfull words like they mean shit, it doesnt affect me anymore. you used to be all i had, and then you dropped me. well look at yourselves. all you have is each other. what happens when something goes wrong and you leave each other? then who do you have? ill tell you......me. because i dont give up on people that easily.. i know im still gonna be there for you..not like you were for me..im different than you are..i believe in second chances..

before i start crying im gonna end it like this. so goodnight all.





IaMcOnFuSeD820 (12:47:00 AM): moving on...
IaMcOnFuSeD820 (12:47:56 AM): i have gas.





""HC02. no one understands us. the 02, its like oxygen, you need it. the HC02 is a family. and no matter what happens, we could not speak to each other for months at a time, but when we wanna get together, we have a blast. no one understands..""
--we really are heather, no one can break us apart. ""the heavenly seven""-we are ""the core"", the original. no were not a gang, we are a family.

"event","well hello there all. its been a while. by popular demand, my livejournal will be updated every now and again. thank you diana for reminding me that i actually had one of these things..

well, lifes been.....life. i have an amazing girlfriend who im completely crazy about, i actually graduated high school and am now off to bigger and better things, and i have things pretty okay with the bank. its been a good 5 months ya know. little problem here and there, but nothing too major to result in an ending. lauren is beautiful. i look at her, and allt hat goes through my mind is, damn, thats my baby. her eyes just catch you ya know. those big baby browns. her smile just makes you want to smile with her. shes so amazing, and i could never get any better. <33333 ..

well, major things this summer:: prom. now that was an experience. being fucked up for 27 straight hours can take a lot out of you. im not kidding. it was me, maureen, candice, val, dave, ray, and anthony. i mean, i had some crazy fuckin fun. the actual prom blew dude. me and christy went into the boys bathroom with mikey and sean and took a few swigs of some alcohol. but yea all together, it sucked. after prom. damn. we baked out a hotel bathroom, chilled and smoked on the beach, got into a car accident (maureeeeen), and i dont really remember the rest lol. but all in all, it was okay..

graduation. amazing day. it sucked because it was boring, but it opened my eyes and now it hit me that, hey, this is the last time ill be setting foot on the football field. this is the last time i have to come to the school by demand. now its all by choice. ill probably be at the school every day because im gonna be picking up lauren and stuff, but still, i dont HAVE to go there. thirteen years of teaching and studying and beating my brains out for a passing grade, all just leads up to one thing: my future. that was all the beginning..now comes the real deal. i dont know if im ready for it, but i know this, im not going to fuck up. im going to pass, and im going to fulfill my dreams. partying will be a side deal..

lets see..what else..hm i know. ive been actually going out and hanging out with people. i mean, i feel my life getting better with every moment i spend with them. ive been going to parties, and going out to eat with people, and meeting new people. and this whole myspace deal, its awesome. ive met so many people and reunited with people and its just great..

so tonight i went to a show at the village pub. my cousin frankie's band played there (strung on grey), jarret's band (leftfield theory), and a bunch of little bands played there. me and lauren left early because we were bored. there were so many people there. we saw vinny and little fiacco, little girl, jeanette, billy, rachel, jesse sayer, mike smith, tom williams and the rest of sftp, my uncle and cousins, nikki benanati, little doolan, james doolan, little rachel who i took to dfp, jessee egan, jen christoffel, krystal, little rieu-sicart, some hott kid named walter, and a bunch of other kids. me and lauren went back to my hosue, pigged out on some food, and layed down and watched tv..

i saw jessee egan at the show tonight. seeing her and having her remember who i am was just awesome. i got so excited. i miss that girl <33 shes so adorable. but, something just clicked in my head after talking to her. i remember the first time i met her was with casey. and i started thinking about the times i had with casey and such. and how i really miss her. i miss all that we used to have. but its not like i can change thing and make them how the used to be. shes changed, and ive changed. shes not the way she used to be when we were best friends. i remember being at the mall a little while ago with lauren and casey and ali were there. we sat down and ate some food, and casey just gave me an attitude kinda deal. i dont know what i did to make her treat me like im a 2 year old, or a piece of shit on the ground. but thats how i felt when i was around her. ali just doesnt talk to me anymore. i dont think we will ever get things to be okay. but i guess if they like the way thigns are with them now, then thats fine with me. if their happy, then alrite, great. my life has been amazing. and i dont think i could ask for me. yea im still smoking weed a bit, but you know what, because i smoke it once in a while it really doesnt change who i am. it doesnt make me a dickhead, and it doesnt make me any kind of bad person. i felt like it did when i first started doing it because well, everyone around me thought it was wrong. but i realize that it doesnt do anythign to change who i am. people change, times change, and you have to deal with it and go with the flow..

i drink once in a while. the last time i got pretty drunk was laurens bday. it was pretty damn funny. me, lauren, farheen, tyler, melissa, rob, and jay went to the beach. us girls got drunk, and the boys drove us home. the girls slept at laurens and we had such a funny night. they all made fun of me because i couldnt do the alphabet when im drunk. and i try to speak perfectly. but its still slurred and precise. farheen made me piss the next morning. i asked her what kind of cereal she had in her hand, and she said ""THE KIND YOU MOTHAFUCKIN EAT BITCH."" and i peed all over the place. and then lauren showed her that i have rather large breasts, and farheen says ""DAMN GIRL WHERED YOU GET THOSE, ON EBAY??"" i really peed myself. it was awesome..

so yea tomorrow i have work 11-5. my work schedule changes starting next week, because i start school on the 31st. =)   well, after work im going to james's partay at n. bike school. should be cool. for now, goodnight all."

"event","well, i dont plan on writing much today.so yea heres what i have to say..

the past few days have been kinda shit.my dog, that ive had for as long as ive had my 15 year old sister, died the other day.she was like a part of the family, and losing her was really hard.one of my moms best friends also lost her daughter to some kind of medical procedure screw-up.she died at age 23, and elena (the girls mom, my moms best friend) is devistated.its so hard losing all these loved ones at once.its really hard..last night i found out that tubby dyke is in the hospital again.she cut herself real bad.im worried for billy and lauren, because theyre best friends with her.i can barely imagine how they must feel, and its not the first time..

a single senior with a lot of balls pulled an awesome prank on all the newfield seniors.someone (who shall remain anonymous) sent out a letter to every senior and their parents talking about after prom, saying that the east wind is offering rooms, as well as ""protection packages"" to every senior for after prom to promote safe sex.everyone believed it, and it ended up being just a single prank the next day.what made it so real was that the person stole the list of every seniors addresses, put the letter on official newfield letterhead, and had mr ross's real stamped signature, just like all the letters do.well i thought it was harmless, but it ended up being everywhere.an article in newsday told about what happened, and channel news 12 and channel 7 news were at the school.some kid came up to me and asked if i had my letter on me, and i said yea.he took it and ran outside with it.when he came back, he told me that he gave it to channel 7 news and they were gonna put it on the news tonight.so yea if you see a copy of the letter shown on the news, yea thats my damn copy.i wanted that back those sons of a bitches.but yea anyway..

yea so laurens here.and tomorrow we really are going to fire island.me, her, kristen, and cousin gina.gonna be awesome.peaceout."

"event","i hate when this happens.i finally just sit and tell myself nothing is going to go back to the way it used to be.i finally convinced myself.and then i go and find things.things to remind me of all the good times..

i cant believe myself.i really cant.i mean, the few single people that have been there for me through everything, i let them down.i couldnt help but go through ali's old journal entries a few minutes ago.i read from the first one all the way to the last one.wow.i cant believe i lost that kind of love we had for each other.well, not like girlfriend kind of love, but we loved each other as best friends, even sisters.i read through all the memories we had together.i read one, close my eyes, and remember it exactly as it actually happened.its so amazing.im such an idiot..i cant believe i totally gave that up.she loved me.and i loved her.i could do anything with her and not feel strange.shes the only person i could lay in my bed with and cuddle with just as though she was my sister.shes the one person i could say anything to, and i know ill get made fun of, but shes used to it because she knew how i was.i loved laying in bed with ali.we could just lay there and hug each other and fall asleep or talk or whatever.we could hang out at my house or her house and have the best time in the world.i would never give up that friendship for anything..but i was wrong.i let go of one of the greatest bonds ive ever had with anyone.i cant believe myself..i know things will never ever be the same as they used to be, im very aware of this, but i wish things could start again.i loved being her best friend.we were two completely different people, but we connected so awesome.i miss having a dubby.i really do.if i could trade it all, or go back to what it used to be i would.i would have never been an asshole that night at andreas.i would have never tried pot.i would have never done anything to anger and upset her.i love her and miss her so much.she probably doesnt feel the same, and i dont blame her.i was selfish and irresponsible.i cant stand having to just glance at her in school and just keep walking.i miss everything.i wish i could turn back time.but that kind of shit isnt real.i lost my best dubby, and i hate myself for it.

best friends are the ones who are they when you need them, and they are there even when you dont think you need them.thats what i used to have.the one thing that sticks out in my mind is my car accident.i didnt expect to see anyone there for me, it didnt even cross my mind.and then when my mom came in the room and told me that i had some visitors, i knew exactly who she was talking about.but little did i expect to see ricky.i had a feeling ali and casey were going to be there, but i would have never guessed ricky would be there.i didnt tell them to be there.i didnt ask them to come.they just did.why? because they loved me.they were my best friends.all three of them.i am ashamed of myself for dicking over the three best people i had in my life.ive broken promises, ive went against morals, ive had my eyes half open for a while.ive made many mistakes.i dont know whether to regret and keep wishing things could get better again, or learn not to regret anything and pay attention to the lesson im being taught.im really not sure.all i know for now is that i lost three amazing kidds.and by my own stupidity.im being repetitive, i know, but once again, i cant even say how sorry i am.its not enough just to put it in words.i really mean it, and i can tell you all now, that my appologies are coming straight from my heart.i love you all.and i am so sorry..

um i think im going to stop here because i definitely need to learn to breathe.goodbye.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ali, im so proud of you.like you told me, just be yourself and dont deny who you are.im trying that on for a change.i miss you dubby.

casey, i love you so much.im so glad that we are friends again.i miss you every second of every day.i loffa you kc.you are the best.

ricky, i dont really know what to say.ive been untrue to you.ive broken promises that meant so much to you.i know ive done you wrong.things havent been going good for you lately, but you have to keep your head up.keep moving on.dont ever give up.you are such a strong person ricky, and youre carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders.but dont break on us now.i love you ricky, i love you as my best friend.never EVER forget, that when you need a shoulder, its always right here."

"event","i dont know why, but i decided to walk back to the school from the game.honestly, i shed a few tears.not just because we lost to west islip by one single run in the 7th inning, not because it was an amazing game that i didnt end up being part of, but because i miss everything.once i saw rosie and kc show up to the game, i kept thinking the whole entire time, "" want to run up to her and hug her..but i cant..im gonna ask permission before i do.yea, definitely."" and that thought diminished when my offer was refused.i felt like i was shot in the heart when she said no.not because she didnt want to, but because other people wouldnt agree with her hugging me...im such a terrible person.i really am.i mean, i cant even hug my best friend without having to check and make sure s o m e o n e s mother isnt looking.i just find it really heartbreaking and sad.when i got back and into my car, i just cried.i miss everything we used to have.and if i could take every bad word or gesture back, i wouldnt hesistate to steal it and burn it.im so wrong for everything ive done...even ricky still hates me.ive done so much wrong to so many people, most my true, best friends.i cant believe myself.i think everytime i close my eyes, even just for a brief second, a memory flashes in my head.whether it be memories from dyke rd lake, or downport, or just crazy times at kc's house, i miss it all.i could sit here and keep telling myself how much i miss it, but im the idiot who doesnt take action.and i ask myself why all the time.i think its because im afraid of what the outcome will be.im not too sure.god, i just really miss it all...the other day darkie said something to me that really meant a lot.and then i thought about it, and ricky said the same exact thing when we were really close.something about how just driving around and talking about nothing and randomly finding something to do is so much more fun than anything.and it means a lot to me.i cant believe i lost all that.i really cant believe it...not only am i upset, but im disappointed in myself.and i really feel like everything ive done has just be wrong to an extent.and i dont know how to fix my wrongs to make them right.im not sure what i can do anymore, and i dont know how much longer i can hold on.my grip on life is slipping, and soon enough, im just going to let go."

4)i failing college english, and if i dont have in the research paper, ill fail for the semester and i wont graduate.
5)i just had $-77 in my bank account.

 out of the 24 hours i was awake yesterday, i was on the phone with lauren for 7 or 8 of them.its crazy..so apparently i have $-77.66 in my checking account.i have no idea how that happened.its insane.but i cashed some checks, so i should be good with that whole thing..

 so almost everyone knows about me.and i didnt expect it to be going this good.everyones either happy for me, or proud of me.thats a lot different from what i expected.i definitely expected to have less friends after it was out, but im glad that the few friends i have stuck by me through it all.thanks guys. =)  ..

 theres really nothing much to write..last night i talked to ria about a few things lately.i figured i should fill in one person from the team so they know whats going on and so they know that im not just a slacker who doesnt show up to practice.she thinks i should go to patti and talk to her.i dont think i should.i really dont know what i would say to her.i dont know how i would even bring it up.besides, i dont want people to think im just feeling sorry for myself and looking for sympathy, because im definitely not looking for jack shit.i cant even explain how i feel.it just sucks..

 so last night..i thought it was a conspiracy at first..both of them iming me on the same night at almost the same time, but for two different things.i was shocked that they even still knew my screen name..al and i had a conversation about all the shit thats been going on and how we arent friends anymore.i told her i miss her a lot, and i really do.she says she misses me too.and i finally found out why our friendship ended in the first place.it wasnt bc of weed, it wasnt bc of me drinking..it was because im a totally different person than i used to be.im sorry that i changed.and that im not the best friend i used to be.i mean, i know that ive changed in little ways, but everyone changes as time goes by.things just faded with us, and i wish that i could turn that around.but i cant.and i dont know what i can really say to help anything out.im sorry i wasnt there for you when you needed me.im sorry that i turned you away when you gave me advice.im sorry for just closing myself up and being alone.i shut you guys out.and im sorry.you deserve better.and now you have it by just having each other.im glad you guys are happy, and ill never forget the good times..

 alrite..im definitely done..not feeling so hot..peaceout nuckas.

"event","alrite everyone.pay attention because im only going to say this once..no body needs to know anything about me.i am not the type of person to go and tell everyone about my life and what i do.everything i do and say and whatnot, is personal, and if i wanted everyone to know, i would tell them myself..

 i usually say ""a secret isnt a secret if you tell someone"" and i like to live up to that.hey cmon, i mean, there will be a point where you can go and tell your closest friend some major secret you have, and they can turn right around one day and tell the world.well guess what.i cant trust anybody with anything.if i cant even trust my so called best friend, why should i trust anyone?..

 people have probably been hearing rumors about me.""kims gay..kims bi..she has a girlfriend..she drives drunk..shes a pothead..etc etc"".i love how people are too pussy to ask me personally, and instead choose to believe the rumor.well everyone would you like to know the truth to these rumors? well yep ill tell you..no i am not gay.for all you people that keep telling me i am, im not, so get the fuck over it.im more of like ""i dont fuckin care"".sure, i like boys, just as much as the next valley girl.but then theres the i dont care side.guess what.i like girls too.and if people have a problem with it, then fuckin eat me because the fact that i dont have a specific sexual preference doesnt change who i am.if this changes anyones opinion about me, im sorry, but then you obviously werent my friend to begin with..do i have a girlfriend?..yes i do.and shes an amazing person.if this offends anyone, i really dont have anything to be sorry about, so im not about to say the words.get over it.open your damn eyes.you dont even realize how many people out there are gay and bisexual.its not hard to find them.open your fucking eyes.its a way of life and im not the only person who has a girlfriend out there, but i wont give out their shit like they gave out mine..ANYWAY..so yes those are true.i used to be terrified to tell anyone, but now i just dont care.why should i have to cry every night because im afraid of what people might think of me? i was so afraid id lose my closest friends, and friends ive kept for so long.but if this makes me happy, why should it even matter what people think? it doesnt.if anyone has a problem with me being happy and me being different from you, let me know, i really need to start finding out who my true friends are anyway..

 and about the other things..drinking and driving..you know what, im not proud..but yes ive done it before.and its unexcusable.i know.ive made stupid mistakes in the past, and i learn from them, and i try to consider it more of a learning experience more than anything..i dont want to be confronted about it again..ive had to hear it from my friends, parents, newfield guidance counselors, centereach guidance counselors, teachers, coaches, and people who im not even close with.its true.its done and over with now.if i can move on from it, so can you..

 drugs.hm.a funny word.two different meanings.drugs are used to help you, and they are abused to alter your mind..is kim a pothead?..well everyone.the answer is: no.kim is not a pothead.unless you consider every once in a while, special occasion or something, taking a few hits, then fine yea i am..definition of a pothead: someone who does drugs to alter their state of mind, therefore making the drug a part of their life they cannot live without..sorry everyone..im not a pothead..

 if anyone has anything to say to me about any of this, my advice to you would be not to be a pussy, and ask me straight up.im getting sick of this ""oh yea i heard this about you...oh yea i heard this....eh eh eh are you this..."".shut the fuckin rumors down and ask me.my policy..ask me flat out, and i wont lie to you.

 thank you and have a nice day."

 people are such shit lately.schivvy was upset bc a freshman might be taking her position at 3rd.i think thats fucked up.schivvy is a thousand times better than anyone on that team.and ive been finding out shit that people have been saying.kristin came up to me 5th period and was like ""just to let you know, i agree with you with the whole shit thats going on"".and she started telling me all this shit that shes been hearing..i was told when i went outside in the courtyard that my ""best friend"" said shit about how i wont make it on the team or some shit, even when we were on speaking terms! ""she said that she knows youre not gonna make it through the season.she said she knows youre going to quit before the seasons over""..hey..well guess what..ive made it this far.the only reason i wouldnt be on that team anymore is if i get kicked off for beating the shit out of you.you people make me so fuckin angry.but in all honesty, shit is so much better than it was.i dont have any assholes trying to make me feel like a dick anymore.no one to sit there and try to prove me wrong, even though they should know that they are fuckin stupid and dont know shit.ugh whatev man..off this topic..

 so i went to heather ciggy's partay on friday.wow that was funny lol.i finally met a SOBER katy big boobs, and i got to hang out with megan and irving.and some other cool ass kidds.it was exciting.IRVING, NEVER AGAIN IRVING.NEVER AGAIN WILL WE TRY AND SNEAK THAT SHIT.lol.then saturday i went to a mets game with lauren and met up with my sister, evan, jessica, my aunt, 2 kiddies, and christina and nicole from work.it was a grand old time.the drive home was funny.i told them about how i was called ""r. kimmie"" for a while bc i hooked up with this 15 year old.they made fun of me non stop for that.and we stopped at a mcdonalds for food and drinks on the way home.a bunch of little kids came in and i was like AW OMG THEYRE SO CUTE.I WANT THE LITTLE BOY OVER THERE.and christina and nicole looked at me with concerned faces.and i walked away.lol theyre such dicks.i didnt mean it like that..christina decided to buy a box of cookies that were in like a happy meal box.i carried them outside and started skipping like a little girl.and the box broke.and the cookies flew all over the place.and i started picking them up and putting them on my car.lauren screams ""DONT PUT THOSE ON YOUR CAR I WAS GONNA EAT THOSE"".lol she would eat them off the ground but not off my dirty car.we all pissed ourselves..we got home and i slept at laurens.my parents kicked me out, and told me to think about moving out.amazing..

"event","exciting night i must say.kerry invited us all over her house for a shindig.i picked up lauren after i showered and such.then we hit up the bee's to say hello to a few madd crazy ganggsters.it was like, oh wow lets have kims entire social life in applebees and have her not be there.dammit.but yeah i saw like 8 million peoples that i miss oh so dearly..jen and britt christoffel, wilson, mo, dave, pete, amanda, mallori, candice, ashley, danielle, alyssa, the sue frigin bird, and then of course my sister and evan were there.i was so excited to see them..afterwards we went to kerry's and all of us got drunk and sang and danced and played pool.it was a good night for the most part..

 a little later when both me and lauren were drunk, we took a walk to c-reach since kerry lives right there.we sat and talked about shit and i told her how i felt about the whole ""best friends"" situation.i told her how much i miss them and how yesterday was one of the most hurtful goodbyes i ever endured.they succeeded at making my life half miserable.after talking, we both had to pee so we peed on the building of centereach.haha.and then stumbled back to kerry's.i left an upside bottle on the curb to feed the ants lol.but yea that was saddening..

 yesterday newfield massacred c-reach 6-1 in an awesome game.little berti hit a homerun that hit the baseball field before rolling toward the backstop.lauren kamena hit a solid homerun over the head of the left fielder.it was amazing.great times.good game.i also slipped on third base.it was horrible.i kept thinking ""girls on 1st and 2nd..i hope she hits it to me so i can touch third and go one and make a solid double play.i want the coaches to see that i dont suck""..what happened? she hit the ball to me.and i went to touch third, and i slipped and fell on my ass.i dont even know how i slipped and fell, but i did.BUT i held onto the ball so yay for me..after the game, a bunch of peoples went to friendly's.me and lee stopped by and waited, but no one showed up until a little later.so we left and went dress shopping with heather and lauren.fun times.me, lee, and lauren got hit on by 3 guys.they were so dumb.they were all like ""you play softball?"" while we were in our uniforms. and were like yea..and theyre like who won..and lee's like newfield did..and theyre like oh where do you go to school.and we just pointed at our shirts and lasughed and walked away.it was good stuff..

 ""if yo had three wishes, no boundries at all, except that you cannot wish for more wishes, what would you wish for?""
yea i have to come up with an answer by thursday.ive been thinking so hard about this, but i cant come up with anything i really wish for.i already know one wish, and thats to be happy again..dammit..ifiwishhardenoughmaybeitwillallgoaway.

"event","yea so who could have guessed that i was late for practice today..anyone?..anyone?..yea i was.i ended up going to the school first and then as i was on my way to the field, all the other cars pulled up.""yea were practicing inside..patti's cold""..ah very nice.sanicola kept calling me the ""black sheep""..and shes right lol.im always in trouble for one thing or another.so yea after practice we were supposed to help set up the homerun fence.everyone else did except for me.i had to return the sisters car so she could go to work.but i ended up going to the bee's with them afterwards.they wouldnt let me pay for anything bc all i got was a bowl of lemons and a water.damn kidds..

 ehhh work blew my ass.well, i didnt even do anything.i wrote a paper the whole time.amazing how i can spend my entire shift sitting in a computer chair writing a paper..i told diana a secret and her and lauren made me angry.so i knocked laurens books on the floor.and she had to pick them up.and i messed them up again, and knocked down some more.revenge is sweet.and then i tied her landyard thingy we have to wear to the pole downstairs.i wasnt really angry.it was fun to pretend..

 so today was cool.carlos was at my house all day, and i ended up taking him to guamshithole and a half to see his gf.i dont care much..he gave me ten bucks.then i went to hang out with lauren and we watched '10 things i hate about you'..kind of ironic in a strange sorta way..

 so tomorrow we play c-reach on their turf.should be good.starts at 2 if anyone wants to come watch.afterwards, going shopping with mah grlllllfriend and deeeeanna.lauren too maybe. ;) .well im gonna go make a phone call and head off to bed.gnite all.

"event","sue bird just hit me back up 2 seconds ago.we FINALLY may just be chillin.niiiiice.you know how we do.steph ryan went on vacay this whole week.i told her that shes not cool anymore because shes not chillin with us.damn you steph ryan.jk man, chill whenever you can bro..

 so pat-med game.interesting, yet pathetic.we lost by like five and played pretty shitty.id like to blame it on the field or the weather, but to face the facts, we played shitty.we made some nice plays and shit, but the errors were like madd crazy whoa.they actually kept me in the game, putting me first at 2nd base, then switched me to 3rd.it was cool with me, i just wanted to play.i didnt get on base, i struck out once and then grounded out.shitty.oh well.there will be more games.we even have homework, thats how terrible we did..so overall, our record is 3-1.not too shabby..
 kristen and salvato attended the game today.MY SUPERHERO IS FINALLY HOME!! i miss her mucho mucho..and christa and rosie came to the game today too.i miss those characters also.rosie left after a little while because she had hitting practice, bc ya know shes actually good.christa stayed for the majority of the game.casey also showed up.i said hello to her, and to my surprise, she said hello back.we shared a nice little moment with ""mimi and bear""..haha good times.bear definitely grew up.but he still looks like a frigin bear..and i got to see caseys mommie.i miss her so much.for the most part, todays game was okay.besides the whole losing to a cocky as shit team, it ended up okay.

 so yea i have to like clean my room and shit.lauren is sleeping over tonight.i heart sleepovers.we both have work in the morning, soooo this should be interesting.and my nana is here.she is one awesome woman..but i must go shower..my sister, salvato, jenna, and i are going to the bees to gather some grub.peaceout burnouts.


 things get a lot less shitty when youre around.you keep a smile on my face.<3

 happy two weeks!! lol"

"event","yea so i just arrived home a short while ago..i was supposed to hang out with lauren and billy and peeps, but i fell asleep and didnt get any of the phone calls because mother dear turned my damn phone off.so yea.i didnt partay like i was supposed to..i called lauren when i woke up and she was taking care of this girl katy, the girl whos party i was supposed to attend.she was madddd crazy sick and needed some TLC.i basically got up and threw my hair up and shizzle and rushed over there.yea the girl was in pretty bad shape.we helped her with her throwup and shit and put her in her room and talked to her and shit to keep her concious.she eventually fell asleep, and things were fine..we asked her random questions, (mind you i never met the girl before), and i asked her if she knew my name, and she let out a slur of ""kinggdomm commme""..we all pissed ourselves.lol i am now known as kingdom come.not that she will remember in the morning, but hey its fun for me to remember.thank god she's okay though.she got the majority of the shit out of her system and she was fuckin funny as hell..""katy, you need a breast reduction.how big are your boobs?""..""tooooo biiig""..awesome.lol..

 today we had our game vs. west islip.it rained of course.what else is new.but isaac and ria went on vacay soooo they put me in at short.but then took me out.and put me at 2nd.i was just happy i was playing.but then they ended up cancelling the game.GO FRIGIN FIGURE.they cancel the only game id actually play in.and they cancelled it RIGHT BEFORE I WAS UP TO THE PLATE.god dammit.we were losing 1-0 though, so yea thats gonna be rescheduled..

 school went by pretty damn slow today.just maybe because it was the last day before vacay.9th period, me and lauren hit up the c-reach to chill with cait and some girl mikayla.we just met her, but she was pretty damn cool.we chilled for the most part in the music dept with her AWESOME asian chorus teacher mr huff puff.(hough? huff? i have no idea.) he was a cool asian man.we saw amelia and knodel and peoples.i heart c-reach.it is a thousand times better than newfield.sigh.i wish i attended that place..

 listen hun..i know things were shitty for you today for personal reasons.i hate seeing you upset and i want you to be happy.keep your head up, and remember it's okay to cry.my shoulder will always be there for you.""hakuna matata"". =)

 yea so im pretty frigin tired from before.im gonna hit the sheets.we have a game tomorrow, but it may be canceled bc of the rain.soooo thats it for today.goodnight all.

 so im back on the softball team.that must have been the longest 3 days of my life..sooo yea friday..friday friday friday..what did i even do friday..oh yea..after work, the lib peoples went out to eat at fridays.but before we went, me and lauren visited a drunken billy at the field by bike path school.""you guys..i cant kiss you..thatd be cheating..and you cant cheat on youre love"".haha OH WOW.good stuff.but yea dinner.interesting.matt making obscene gestures.MATT YOU OWE US 4 BUCKS DICK.saturday i had practice in the morn, and then drank and slept at lauren's.FOR SERIOUS..woke up on sunday NOT wanting to wake up, and then picked up billy, dylan, and jennifer and went to the late december (early november) show.ah i heart them a lot.so yea that was a good show.we got mcdonalds beforehand and ate it all and smelled up my car like fries and shit.and then after we went to ralphs italian ices (omg orgasmic) and i almost ran over a bunny.i screamed.as well as dylan and billy and jennifer.

 so today was the one month since jessie passed.i miss that girl.it just doesnt feel the same anymore.im so used to going into the cafeteria and looking at her as she passes by and telling people how she looks like a pretty version of kelly osbourne.id look at her, and remember all the good times we had with my cousin.everytime i hear that song by eminem that goes ""you dont..wanna fuck with shady..cause shady..will fuckin kill you"", it reminds me of her.lol.i remember at my cousins bday party, we played that song over and over and over again and just laughed at the part where it goes ""skibidee bee bop and christopher reeve.sonny bono, skiis, horses, and hittin some trees (HEY!)""..we just laughed all morning to that song..it sucks to drive down the road she was killed on.its like i can feel her presence or something.i dont know..we all miss you jess.rest in peace.i love you homiesniffles.

 so yea work blows.i dont even know why.but it does.and so does softball.yea i joke around a lot, but its because they dont play me n any games or practices, what else am i supposed to do to keep me occupied? come on now.yea i dont even know.im so tired.

 so yea lauren made me break my phone.""i wonder what it sounds like to be thrown against a wall""..so i did..and now my phone is in two pieces.amazing.AND.the whore makes me late going home every day.stupid lesbian.lol.jk jk jkkkkkk.

 but yea things have been hard, but im alive right? oh yea btw it ends up i have a torn tendon in my right elbow.and 2 cysts in the same arm.and my leg is still swollen from my accidente.awesome.goodbye.

 can i just say something..321

 CHEAAAAAAAAAAA
sue bird, im saying that for the rest of my life.theeenks maaaaan.

-drunken laser tag with madd chill peeps.

so yea things were getting better than ever.no one was mad at me, things with me and the boy were fine, and things just werent doing so bad..but then, the drama production happened..go figure.drama occurs betwixt best friends at a drama production..my best friend and i have been in such a hole lately.we barely talk, we cant tell each other anything, we dont hang out as much as we used to, and everything is just so different now than it was.i remember when we used to be so happy, taking our walks and learning new things about each other.life was good.i loved her so much, she could relate to me and was just absolutely amazing.and my c-reach sweetie was the best.she was just awesome to hang with and was the sweetest girl alive..well, lately, supposedly, i have changed.and no ones liking it.on saturday night, i called my best friends and basically had a screaming match with them.i sat in the lobby by the auditorium with the big black security guard d-bo watching me and listening to everything i was saying.and thats when my other best friend came on the phone..and said something i would never expect her to say..""kim..never call my house ever again.goodbye"" and she hung up.i went insane.i ran out of the place trying to hold it all in until i got to my car.when i locked myself in my car, i broke down.i called ricky and i couldnt stop crying..i hung up with him and drove to the gas station.the guy looked at me like i had 10 heads and was cut up on every single one of them.i wanted to go somewhere..anywhere.i started to drive to the lake in the pouring rain.i held my box cutter tight in my hand, and just kept thinking of what lauren and ricky once said ""down the road and not across down the road and not across""..it was like a broken record.i ended up getting lost and tryed to find my way back.i found the lake and sat there by myself, just crying and recalling old memories.i got back in my car and sat there.i dont know what was going through my head.once again, i did something stupid, and that could have been potentially dangerous.on the way to the lake, i took about seven zoloft, and i had a hard time swallowing them.(for some reason ive been having trouble breathing and swallowing lately.)i grabbed the first liquid substance i could find.it was a schmirnoff.i poured it into a water bottle, swallowed, and proceeded to head back to the school to get lauren and billy.on the way back, i took the bottle and threw whatever was left out the window.i got back to the school and parked in the parking lot, and then i passed out.im not sure how long i was passed out for, but i felt so wierd.i woke up hearing sara say ""yo i think this is kimmie's car""..i looked out the window and sara and gumby were standing behind my car smoking a bogie.i got out and they were like OMG YOU WERE IN YOUR CAR?? and im like yea man i was sleeping..i totally blacked out.andrea came over to me and felt my heart.she said it was beating so god damn strange and fast and a wierd rythem.sara was holding me so i didnt fall.and i was shaking bc i was so cold.and they said that it wasnt that cold out.they told me to go inside, so i did.and i waited until intermission.i looked at my thumb, and apprently i cut my thumbs bc they had some deep cuts.and i dont remember doing anything else, but i have a scratch on my wrist.i could swear on everything that i didnt do it.i sat and waited for a few, then i went into the thing to watch the second act with britt and mootz.good play..good people..i miss the good kids..

 all weekend i hung out with lauren and billy.sleepovers are soooooo cool! sooo fun fun fun.i heart them.so yea, i got like no sleep this weekend.we slept at laurens on friday, and saturday slept at billy's after the play.i definitely love those two.they make me laugh and smile and they took my mind off of ridiculous shit..

 i missed practice the next morning, and work.i woke up way too late, and didnt get a chance to go to either one.i went into school today to find out im suspended from the team.i was told that im irresponsible, and that i have to learn to put my priorities in order.i dont even know.it hink they went a bit overboard suspending me.they told me i wasnt even supposed to practice today, they just ""didnt want to embarrass me in front of the team"".gee thanks for caring..so yea forget about my dream to be a starter lol..

 i definitely have not had good nights lately.it seems that drama shit happens at night.from now on, im going to bed early to avoid any confrentation that may occur to make my life even more of a hell.i just want to sleep each and every day away.all the passing days just suck.and its really getting harder and harder to wake myself up and li to myself and say ""today should be good"".i dont know man..

 ok yea.lol so what is it with people and robbing my shit?? haha.not to mention any names man, {cough cough ALYSSA, LILLY, MALLORI, JAMIE, ETC ETC cough cough} lol jk i love you guys.i like when people take my shit, it makes me feel good..

"event","<P>hi.my name is kimberly alyssa forrester.i am seventeen years old and live in the town of selden in the state of new york.its a little place on this island thats basically connected by the city.i grew up in the simple life in my grandmas house.then eventually moved to my house now.my childhood was basically filled with distrust and paranoia.after a major event that happened with my neighbor and at times myself, my life changed from being a happy kid, to knowing that theres no one in this world that can be trusted.every step i took farther away from home was another step that could lead to danger.thats how i lived.. i grew up pretty lonely.i had a few friends and one best friend.i tried to look for meaning to life since i was younger.believe it or not, i did.up until the 10th grade, i was the typical ""good kid""..the good grades, the good friends, the respectable one, the one who didnt lie to her parents about where she was going.i swore on my life that i would never smoke or curse or anything.i was basically a good two shoes.i didnt really mind, i was happy about who i was for the most part.tenth grade..the year my life took a complete 180.. </P>
<P>i was getting pretty sick of being the one who was good all the time.im not really sure how it happened exactly, but i changed.i got drunk for the first time in my life on 2/25/02 with the HC, including my sister and other friends from softball.it was amazing.it was my frist time ever doing something that my mother wouldnt approve of.i drank a few, and i kept getting more and more dizzy.it was the greatest feeling i ever felt.the feeling of not having a care in the world, and being able to call anyone your friend, was so great.i loved being able to hang onto someone i didnt know and just have a good time.it was great to have something to take my mind off of the shit in my life.it was great.eventually i began drinking more, but without my sisters supervision.everytime i drank, i would feel my best.if i was mad, i would go and drink.if i was upset, i drank.and my problems went away for that few hours i was wasted.ive drank myself to the point where i would throw up all over the place, or even wake up and not know where i am.i once even threw up all over this kids apartment.the sink, the walls, the bathroom, and the worst part was that i didnt even knew where i was or how i got there.it was bad.but i loved it.i loved the relaxation i felt.well, that same night, it led me to something else.i was drunk enough to try something i swore id never try.i wasnt even concious to know that i was doing it.but i was upset enough and drunk enough to try it.. </P>
<P>the first time i didnt get the full effect, only because i was already wasted and youre not supposed to smoke after you drink.but i did.and i hated it.i hated every minute.but i realized later on that i didnt get the full effect.so i tried it again.things became wavy, and i started seeing things out of the corner of my eyes.and i was colder than everyone else.it was wierd.and i didnt like it.but i kept on trying it.repeatedly over and over again on different nights.i dont know why, i guess just because it was something to do, and another ESCAPE from my problems.lame excuse i know, but it was an escape for me.. </P>
<P>before anything with drugs started, i became best friends with a few certain people.they meant the world to me, and they were a few of the greatest people ive ever met.me and ali became best friends, and one day, ricky became a major part of my life also.and casey was a best friend to me also.we couldnt be any happier.. </P>
<P>i can be honest on something, that the most major reason i have problems that are only cured by alcohol, started in 11th grade.i met one amazing individual that changed who i was.i was in love.it was crazy enough, but i was really in love with this kidd.i never felt anything for anyone else before, like what i felt for them.and then the day that things broke off, i felt like the world couldnt crash down anymore.they didnt break my heart, but i felt like they stole a piece of it, and are never going to give it back.it was the worst thing in the world.i didnt know how to deal with it any other way than, take a guess..drink drink drink.. </P>
<P>i made a promise recently that i apparently couldnt keep.and i ended up hurting the one person who actually made me happy.he taught me how to smile again, something that i had forgotten how to do since the summer.every moment i spent with him, as friends or more, gave me a feeling that not any drugs or alcohol could ever give me.he took my mind off of my problems, and i was focused only on him.it was a feeling i havent felt in forever.and i never thought that someone could ever make me happier than a few beers could.it was something so different, and i loved it.. </P>
<P>the promise i made to him seemed to matter more to him than it did to me.dont get me wrong, i am not proud of myself for breaking it, im unhappy at the fact that i hurt someone that i care about so much.i care more about him now than i ever have, and i was a fool to ever do anything to hurt him.not only did i hurt him, but ive changed enough to where i hurt my best friend.and she doesnt even know me anymore.it makes me sick to know that ive changed that much.i didnt see it until now.and i regret doing anything to change who i was, and i dont like who ive become now..</P>
<P>to the world, especially my best friends, i am sorry.i know it doesnt help or mean much anymore because ive said it so many times.each tear ive cried over this situtation, has given me another reason to hate myself.im sick of having to say sorry all the time.this will be the last time i hurt the people i care about most..i love you guys like no tomorrow.im so sorry for doing anything that changed your opinion on me.ive been stupid, and for various reasons.my ""escapes"" are&nbsp;doing nothing more than breaking my relationships with people.i vow now from here on, that i will no longer smoke pot or anything like that.but, i refuse to quit drinking.drinking is just who i am, and what i like to do, and i am not going to stop it any time soon.i like drinking, and it hasnt ruined my life any more than the pot did..</P>
<P>my feelings cant be expressed in just words.if i wanted to tell everyone how i felt about what i did, my head would be banging against a brick wall, and my arms and legs would be broken and shattered.i hate myself for everything ive done..i know it will take time to earn back the respect that people once had in me, but im willing to take that time.my relationships with both my best friends and my bf-kinda thing mean more to me than getting high and seeing leprachauns..i love you all..and again, im so sorry.please forgive me for everything ive done.</P>"

"event","i said i would have some interesting stuff on here. but i dont....not yet any ways. i dont have much to write about today so im just gonna tell you people some more about me...hmm.......where do i start?...well, i guess i should tell you about my family..........theyre all screwed up, yup. my little sister felicia resents me because i weigh a whole 20 pounds less than her,so shes constantly reminding me that i used to be fat (i weighed about 190) and her and christen (my other little sister) are always calling me an anorexic and saying how i look like shit because im skinny now (i now weigh 110 lbs) and feel it necessary to remind me that i have had eating disorders (im better now, well im getting ther- hey i gained 10 pounds =]), my other little sister amber is kind of cool but shes a ho, big time. and my 2 little brothers are jerks, plus theyre sissy mamas boys. my mom is faking a mental illness, saying shes manic depressive, its amazing someone verey close in my family happened to be a manic depressive, and a few months ago she said she had lost so much weight her doctor thought she was anorexic ( this was the same time i was having my food issues- coincidence? i think not) but i dont let them get me down because i know im above them and their immature little games. me and angel are the only 2 out of seven kids who are able to think for themselves and its amazing because were the only two who dont live with my real mom, so basically the bitch has them brainwashed. oh, my mom resents me for getting skinny too, but thats just because i used to outweigh her by 10 pounds and now she outweighs me by probably 90 (i think she gained weight, not lost it) and i know shes pissed because she cant even squeeze into my old clothes ( i was between a size 14 and a size 16, but i could still squeeze into a 13) and thats a really dumb thing to resent someone for- she can go out and spend 200 dollars on excercise equipment and another 200 on diet pills and subscribe to every fitness magazine out there (she did all of that) but it doesnt do any good if for one you dont use it and secondly all you do is sit on your ass all day stuffing your face with chips,cookies,and candy and then sit down to a huge dinner of dead animals (im a vegetarian,so i dont eat meat) and mac and cheese with microwave mashed potatoes to g along with it. she doesnt understand that you gotta work for it too. i do 200 crunches every night, 160 reverse crunches, plus calisthenics, every single damn night, it may not sound like all that much but thats only a third of what i used to do..........
            ok im done rambling about my family now, except to say i do like my sister angel, shes always been my favorite sister, not only because she lives with me but because she doesnt copy everything i do like the others, especially amber, they copy the way i dress, do my hair, my make up, my clothes, my music,the way i talk, even the damn jewelery i wear! its pathetic, but i guess nobody ever told them to be their own person. at least angel is her own person, she has her own unique style to her, really she does. thats why i like her the best out of all my siblings. well anyways, im off here, i wanna go to sleep, plus i still gotta do my excercises. see yas."

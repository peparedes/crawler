"event","its been awhile since ive written anything here.
i've been pretty busy, all the hw i put off at the beginning of the semester is finally starting to be due so thats taking up some time.

i also feel like i'm trying to juggle to groups of friends, neither of which want anything to do with the other and thats frustrating and inconvenient for me.  i really like hanging out with my girls and i love my roommate, i wish they could all get along.

my weekends have been pretty typical, homework, working out, and some sort of partying i suppose.  mostly we go out to the bar but two weekends ago i went home to indiana with the roommate.  i always chuckle a little when i go down there, its so different from what i'm used to, even more so than chicagoland.

tomorrow for halloween i was told today that we're all dressing up like burritos and going to chipotle and getting free burritos...sounds good to me since i missed out on my free taco today, i was just too tired to drive to taco bell for one taco.  tomorrow night i'm either going to the haunted house that the boys side of my dorm puts on or dressing up and going to doc ryans...either sounds fun to me.

im much too tired to ramble anymore because i feel like i could go on forever if i let myself.  instead, i think i'm going to go lay down and watch some LA ink.  i'll leave you with a few pictures.

"event","the thing is, there really arent many people here at school who give a shit about me.  and you know what?  it makes me a little sad, but i have so much that these people dont have.  because really what have they achieved?  meaningless friendships sustained by alcohol and petty conversation that will disolve after a few years or maybe even less time?  congrats.

i, however, do have lots of people who love me, and who will for a long time.  they're not here, but they would be if they could.

<b>-my family who will always be there for me, no matter what.  even without being here, they still make me feel more special than most anyone else could on my birthday.</b>
-my boyfriend, kyle adam simon, who always picks up his phone and listens when i call him crying because someone else has let me down.  if he could, he'd come here everyday just to give me a hug.
<b>-holly grace mulherin.  not many adults have had friends for 12 years and i'm blessed to have her in my life.  no matter how many miles we are apart, we will always love each other.  ithaca, summer 2007 will be epic!!</b>
-mark williams.  my darling, i hope you can come up here this weekend, things will rule if you do. :)  i dont really understand how we became friends, i'm just glad that we did, its been two years, can you believe it??
-<b>my six oh three friends.  i'm sure we will love each other always and have reunions and reminisce about things like the time we got drunk at kegglers den and went bowling over easter break 2007. :)</b>
-kelly, we can always talk about anything.  i cant wait to see you and spend time with your this summer.  i think we're going to get real close again, at least, i hope so.  i cant wait to be in your wedding!
<b>-mr. aaron hawn, you are my saving grace on my birthday.  thank you so much for going out with me tomorrow night, i think the day might have ended up being a total bust without you.  you are such a kind person. :)</b>
-and matt.  i know you wont be around next year, and we kind of just met, but i've never really met anyone who cared so much about others (even though you sometimes try and act like you dont).  you hugging me today was just what i needed, i truly appreciate it.

thats got to be AT LEAST 25 people without even thinking too hard.  and i've met so many people on my travels lately who have welcomed me with open arms and who have genuinely seemed to like me.

concordia university, you are temporary.  lots of shitty things happened here, but none of it will break me.  i've had some shitty luck, but i'm going to get through it.  there was life before you, and there will be life after you, i'll take the important things and people from this part of my life with me and leave everything else behind me.  i say, whatever to you CUC."

"event","so i'm home and its great.
getting here yesterday suuuuuucked.  my flight was delayed because the plane got stuck in omaha so we didnt leave until 8:30 and we were supposed to leave at 6:40.  it sucked even more because my plane had to go to baltimore before NH so it was like the longest ride ever.

i finally got to manchester around 12:30 and we got to my house around 1:15 AM, i think.  needless to say, i was exhausted.  i slept until mom woke me up at like 10:30 this morning.

today me and mom went to the museum of fine arts in boston.  i took lots of pictures of paintings that i can use maybe in a lesson or for projects when i start teaching.  i'm sure i can use them for a lesson plan for art methods too.  when i got home jeff called me and i met him and griff and crystal up at friendlys for icecream.

my family just finished dinner and i'm exhausted again.
i was thinking about going to boston tomorrow but i just dont know if i have the energy.  we'll see. <3"

2. if we call you, pick up your phone.  if you're busy, just text us and tell us so.
3. R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
4. don't say things about to your friends that you wouldnt say to us.  we will find out.
5. dont call us clingy.  if you didnt want to hang out with us, just tell us.  if you want us to stop calling, pick up your phone.
6. to us, ""i'll call you later,"" doesn't mean eight hours later.
7. please dont kiss and tell.  if you must tell, dont tell everyone, twice.
8. dont expect us to be ok with you making out with the whole campus. (see #3)
9. when we ask you to hang out, we dont have any alterior motives, we just want to hang out!

""i'm really hoping to teach in the chicago public school system.""
""oh, but in the nicer areas, right?  there are some really dangerous parts of that city.""
""no, i want to teach on the south or west side, in an inner city area.""
""oh...really?...why?""



why?  i guess i dont really know why.  if i wanted to make lives better it could easily be argued that i could do so in a quiet, comfortable, suburban school.  indeed, there are many fine educators who teach at these schools, and it is to them that i owe many thanks for helping make me the person i have become.  by no means would i ever downplay the importance of any educator.  each teacher innevitably affects the lives of so many children for the better, and the world is a better place because of each of them.

i know i'm no hero, no one will ever make a movie about me, or write a book, or even a newspaper article for that matter.  and thats ok.  but i guess when it all comes down to it, i just feel like its the right thing to do, for me.  we're all called to different professions, we have different talents, abililties, goals, and dreams, none superior to another, and this is mine, to create change in the world in a small, quiet way doing what i love.  i fully accept that it will not be easy, but its been my experience (and i've often been told) that the best things never are.

so why?  because i can, because i want to, because this is what i was made for.  i dont think i need any reason beyond that."

dont put all your faith in one person, no matter how much you care about them.  people are imperfect, they fail and they let you down sometimes.  however, the imperfections in people can also be beautiful, they are what make us who were are.  we all fall short sometimes, but the important thing is to learn from the mistakes we make, grow, and become stronger.  the human spirit always proves itself to be stronger than we tend to think it is.  things will be hard sometimes, but when given the choice of sinking or swimming, i know i'll be able to swim, or at least tread water for awhile until i can get moving again.

"event","<i>maybe the truth is there's a little bit of loser in all of us, ya know?  being happy isn't having everything in your life be perfect.  maybe it's about stringing together all the little things, like falling alseep with someone watching a movie or seeing christmas lights at the zoo, and making those count for more than the bad stuff.  maybe we just get through it, and that's all we can ask for.</i>

that part of the movie makes me sob, every single time.





i started packing my room today. moving out feels like moving on, from a lot of things. some things i'm ready to leave behind me, and others, i'd keep around for a long time if i could.

today in spanish, very appropriately, our final composition on our exam was to talk about what we wanted to do with our lives...after college. i almost laughed when i saw the topic, and i think it was probably the best composition i've ever written for her. i felt excited as i was writing it. it made me realize that college is just a small part of a very big life.

after college. i want to join the peace corps. then i want to teach at an elementary school in an inner city. or maybe switch the order around. i want to give back to a world that has given me so much. (just for fun-- i had to name my children in my compostion...patrick hemmingway and emma austen or sula eleanor and isaac dylan.) but the point, is what i've always told other people, the little things, they just cant matter, there's no time for them. and in the scheme of things, even all this, is a little thing, compared to what i have to look forward to.

honestly, i think in time, i'll look back on this part of my life fondly. i learned how to be on my own and it made me stronger. i learned a lot about life, and about people. surprisingly though, i'm coming out of this with a better view of people in general than i had going into it. i think i know the reason for it too, and i'm thankful. things happen for a reason. i've always believed that and i probably always will.

if you're leaving, more likely than not, i'm going to miss you. hence the title of this, note, ""see ya"". i wish i had gotten more of a chance to know certain people, but even just the last two months have been pretty swell. take care of yourselves if you're heading out of here and enjoy the real world, because we all know, this is not reality (a little david 115 wisdom).

and finally, i'll try not to wonder ""what if"", because i think things could have been real good, in different circumstances. i definitely did not expect to care like i do, or as much as i do, but i dont regret anything. i really dont.

be easy everybody, wherever you're going. good luck, and i'll see ya sometime i hope."

i would be lying if i said i was happy all the time lately, but i knew this would happen.  matt and i talked about it over the summer that if i decided to end things, i was probably going to be super lonely for awhile.  we talked for a long, long time about how i was scared, scared of being alone.  i miss having a best friend here.  it was nice to have someone that i could call up whenever i felt like doing something or going somewhere or eating a meal and knowing that person would always be up for it, because they were my best friend.

i wouldnt ever blame anyone but myself for this.  i let myself become consumed in a relationship, i rushed things.  i was blind to the fact that it was hardly relaistic that my first serious boyfriend would be my life long love.  i let people i cared about drift away from me because i thought that he was all i needed.  i put too much trust in one person, and in true fashion to my life, i got burned.

my mom told me though, no one else could have told me this, not even her, i had to learn this lesson for myself.  and it sucks that i had to learn it this way, but at least i figured it out.  and in the end, maybe this will be good for me.  its time to sink or swim, and i think i'm kind of doggy paddling right now, but i'm not going under.  and i wont.  i know i will come through this a better, wiser, and happier person, there is a light somewhere at the end of this tunnel.  and in the meantime, i've never been that good being on my own, i've always needed someone, so maybe this will toughen me up a little bit and make me happier with myself, just liz.  and when all else fails (or maybe before everything else), i know i've got someone taking care of me, and i'll never really be alone.

and finally, when i was writing this, i felt a sense of calming peacefullness.  things aren't really ok right now, but they will be, someday.  and i'm excited for that someday.  i'm going to keep working on things and keep holding my head up. &hearts;"

"event","today i had two group projects and a paper due.  so i'm pretty tired.  and i think one of the projects sucks but at this point, it doesnt matter.

i've been pretty good lately.  probably because i've been too busy/tired to think about not being good or to think about missing home.  i think i will be playing some pizza power tonight after class, most likely, so i'm excited for that.

i'm moving, also.  allllll the way across campus.  if you've ever seen my school, you will probably laugh at me saying 'allllll the way' because its not even a block to the other side of campus, but it definitely seems real far in december.

i cant believe i'm going home again in a week.  woah.  that was fast. <3"

"event","i'm free.  i'm a little rougher around the edges and a little wiser.  i still dont know if i know exactly what i want, but i know i've figured out what i dont want.  and i'm going to be ok.  i've actually felt happier the past two days than i have in a long time.  my steps are bouncy and i have moments when i'm alone and i smile, for no reason.  people make me happier.  i feel more like myself than i have in a very long time.  i feel like laughing, and playing in the snow, and playing the piano, and running, and decorating for christmas.

and i guess the best part about this is that i know i always have people who love me.  they may be 1,000 miles away, but thats ok, just knowing they are there helps.

<lj-cut text=""oh, and we'll find each other one day"">
my other half and i.  some days, we'll watch crappy (or good) movies together and eat junk food in our pjs all day.  we'll have adventures, which will undoubtedly sometimes turn out horribly but sometimes they'll be better than we could have imagined.  we'll take naps together at weird times.  we'll play outside on playgrounds in the summer, fly kites in the spring, make snowmen in the winter, and jump in (other people's) leaf piles in the fall.  he probably won't get excited for things as i do, but my excitment will make him laugh and he'll humor me, and i'll love the challenge of trying to make him excited.  we'll appreciate the simple things together, apple picking, farmers markets, and good thrift stores.  burps and sometimes farts wont bother either of us, they'll just make us laugh.  silly tv will be our favorite and it will entertain us for hours.  he'll keep all the pictures i color for him in a drawer somewhere.  it probably wont ever be anything dignified or particularily refined, but thats probably because i'm not very dignified or particularily refined.  and it probably wont be exactly like i expect, but you get the idea :)</lj-cut>"

I never loved nobody fully 
Always one foot on the ground 
And by protecting my heart truly 
I got lost in the sounds 
I hear in my mind 
All these voices 
I hear in my mind all these words 
I hear in my mind all this music 

And it breaks my heart 
And it breaks my heart 
And it breaks my heart 
It breaks my heart 

And suppose I never ever met you 
Suppose we never fell in love 
Suppose I never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft 
Suppose I never ever saw you 
Suppose we never ever called 
Suppose I kept on singing love songs just to break my own fall 
Just to break my fall 
Just to break my fall 
Just to break my fall 
Break my fall 
Break my fall 

All my friends say that of course its gonna get better 
Gonna get better 
Better better better better 
Better better better 

I never love nobody fully 
Always one foot on the ground 
And by protecting my heart truly 
I got lost 
In the sounds 
I hear in my mind 
All these voices 
I hear in my mind all these words 
I hear in my mind 
All this music 
And it breaks my heart 
It breaks my heart 
Breaks my 
Heart 
Breaks my heart 


I hear in my mind 
All these voices 
I hear in my mind all these words 
I hear in my mind 
All this music

It breaks my heart 
Breaks my

Breaks my heart 
and it breaks my heart 
it breaks my heart 
and it breaks my heart 
and it breaks my heart

"event","<i>""Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion's starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it's always there - fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge - they were all messages of love. If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually is all around."" <b>-Love Actually</b></i>



that always makes me smile.  whenever i'm sad or lonely lately I think about that and then i feel better because it makes me think about going home and coming out into the terminal and standing on my tiptoes to see mom and dad through the glass and then running past everyone else and into their arms.  i havent seen that movie in awhile and then this week when i was not the happiest i saw it twice and once on accident, i'm pretty sure thats a sign of some sort...or it means its getting closer to christmas, take your pick.

i had chocolate covered marshmellows tonight.  and bought a new bag that was handmade in nepal.  and last night, me and lora watched grizzly man and tried to immitate the bears and took some pictures.  i need to do years of homework tomorrow and i know i wont do it.  duh."

home has been pretty sweet.

my first night back, i got to see my amigos, but i also popped the front tire on my car at midnight.  not the best thing and it was coooooold, but we had a semi-adventure, got to meet a crazy guy who worked for triple a, and i'd say we all learned something.  me, i learned that it actually is important to know where things like the jack for your car is. :)

the actual day of thanksgiving was standard.  we ate the food, drank some wine, i wrote a paper, we watched deal or no deal, i wrote some more paper, and then i fell asleep.

i got my christmas shopping pretty much taken care of during some early am (5:30!!) shopping the day after thanksgiving.  i also bought myself 5 pairs of undies, earrings, and a purse for $23!  i also saw christie and janet and got to play with janets little cousins.

today we went out for breakfast at SEVEN AM!! (who does that?)  then went to some crazy shop thing and mom bought us candy at 9:30 to shut me and daniel up, hahahahaha.  i was lazy most of the day today after that.  but i CUT MY OWN HAIR and worked on a paper on The Lion King for a little bit.  soon, i'm going to help mom buy jeans.  tonight, friends for a little bit again :)

tomorrow, church. home. airport to go back to chicago.

"event","i'm exhausted.  my pillow case is covered with countless nights worth of tear stains.  the only thing that keeps me awake lately is bottles of diet wild cherry pepsi.  but for the first time in a month, i'm ok, and for the first time in a long time, i'm ready to be by myself.  i'm terrified, honestly.  but i feel a sense of liberation at the same time. <b>this didnt break me.</b>  i made it through, and i did it by myself.  i made mistakes, but they were my mistakes.  they were mine to make, mine to accept the consequences from, and mine to try and fix.

i realized, for the first time in my entire life, that just like everyone else, i dont have to be perfect.  i've been so absorbed in trying that i completly missed the point.  its not about making the right choices all the time, its about learning from the wrong ones.  people are imperfect, and thats what makes each of us so beautiful.  if we were never angry, love would never be so wonderful, and if we were never sad, joy would be empty.

the only true disapointment, the only true failure, in life is apathy.  to not care is the saddest waste of the human spirit that man can know.  it is fear that drives apathy.  a fear of feeling, a fear of failing, a fear of being wrong, a fear of changing.  i dont fear pain and sorrow, i fear apathy, because the day i become apathetic is the day i have given up.

its been a long month.  but i grew and i changed.  i learned a little bit and what i learned is what i just wrote above this.  surprisingly, im coming out of this without any resentment.  too much has happened for that.  i appreciate what happened, and now i'm glad its finally over.  i'm ready to move on, alone for now.





i'll be home soon.  it'll be thanksgiving, and i know i'll be happy.  i'm going to smother mom and dad at the airport.  me and mom will both cry and no one will stop talking the entire car ride home (i'll probably dominate the conversation).  on thanksgiving, we'll sit around and watch the parade and football while mom yells at us to help her while she's making dinner.  we'll all eat too much, and we'll probably finish a whole pie and gallon of icecream.  my friends will be around.  we'll play catch phrase and be content just to sit and talk with each other for hours.  maybe the girls will go shopping together.  things will be peaceful, and happy.  and i'll take in every moment and hold it with me until christmas comes.  soon. &hearts;"

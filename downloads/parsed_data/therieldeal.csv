"event","so now i have no job.  fuckin a.  this is just great...

steph owes me more money than i have to my name right now.  

anyone know somewhere that i can get a job? making like... $324463 an hour maybe? thatd be nice.  i need to get out of here.  my house... this town... state... area... but i dont know where i would go seeing as im not so good on the people skills and im broke.   fabulous! trapped once again

the band is even going to shit.  matt and i discussed it this evening.  we havent played in like 4 months. what the fuck kind of band is that.  im about ready to give up on music shit.  ive got a good several thousand dollars into my music gear... 

blah blah blah im going to continue bitching

ive been single for a good year now, without even a prospect.  what the fucks up with that? apparantly i just AM that much of a failure.  that or no one wants to date someone who looks like jesus.  either way, what the fuck?

ive got my car and no money so if anyone wants to pay me for gas i will bring them places.  i have nothing else to do now.  100% free time other than community service and drug classes for my arrest.  fucking cops. 

so the best part of all of this, is because i got arrested, i had to drop a semesters tuition cost on court and the classes, and now i lost my job.  so without my job i have no way to earn that money back to pay for school, and if im not going to school i have to get my own health insurance, which i was going to get through wal mart... but guess what! no more wal mart.  no insurance. no medication. means i wont be able to drive again in a few months when my parents insurance drops me.  aint that just dandy?

so yeah.  fuck this shit, im pretty sick of everything from school to work to music to friends to girlfriends to pretty much everything i can think of.  <b>someone please find me something to be excited about </b>besides getting completely cocked, cause god knows i wish i could spend everyday in a drunken stupor right now.  because im about to<b> give up.</b>"

yep, watched that movie this evening with sabrina.  twas a good time.  got to hang out at her dads house and eat dominos pizza (shitty place to work, but good pizza nontheless).  beans gonna be in the production at the bradley soon (of JCS).  as i said, twas a good time.

the last 2 nights i spent at stephs house,  but i said i was at matts house cause my parents are crazy like that.  saturday, lindsay and carissa hung out but then went home, but last night nate and carissa slept over too (which meant that i got to sleep on the floor... dammit.) oh well, it was a good time.  we got to watch good movies (including the wedding singer), and steph told me every detail of her love life... because she was upset about what was going on downstairs.

also today... i bought a bass cabinet.  its kinda huge... and really loud.  but thats okay, i like it that way.  now i just have to get it into the house.. hmm.

also in attendance (besides jeff and john) were andrea (jeffs girlfriend) and nicole (andreas sister, johns girlfriend), and sabrina (gets something in parentheses too).  after band practice, everyone left but sabrina, who hung out and played some guitar, violin, harmonica, looked at stupid pictures, and watched some aqua teen hunger force ('twas a good time).  then my dad brought her home cause im dumb and have no car :(.

"event","so, i spent all day at wal mart today.  i think people should visit me more. yes, visit me. i command it.

there were a few highlights today, heres the most exciting:

first and foremost, there was a sighting of the rare and mighty BRENDA (of the HEATH category) at, who would have guessed, the wal mart snack bar.  she lumbered by on her way to the counter to purchase some sort of fatty food product.  wow.

i also saw like 3 of my old teachers from high school.  that was a blast.

and i saw maureen, shes cool.  she skipped beans concert though (which i also missed due to wal mart, sadly)  

thats about all that happened today.  perhaps tomorrow will be better... i hope i can find a ride at 6 to go do SOMETHING, preferably with people, and not man eating gerbils. and not at wal mart. ive had too much wal mart lately... it cant be healthy.  i find myself praising sam walton by accident, frightening.

"event","so i havent updated this in a DAMN long time.  so i am right now.

my life recently has consisted of a whole lot of working at wal mart.  (its fun i swear)  that and doing various random things.  heres some of the non wal mart related stuff i have done recently (but not too far back cause i have a bad memory)

on friday i hung out at stephs house, it was a good time.  carissa, sabrina, and nate were there.  we got drunk.  saw some girl i sort of knew like 3 years ago who somehow recognized me, which is odd.  oh well.

wal mart

wal mart

on monday i hung out with bean and watched lock stock and two smoking barrels (an excellent movie).  then, she had to go to play practice. so we walked to the bradley, then i went to savage and hung out for a bit, and then michelle and sam met me in downtown putnam, where we waited for bean to ge tout of practice, and then we went to the courthouse and ate.  note: mexican pizza from the courthouse is supurb.

more wal mart

today sabrina and i chilled again, and watched snatch, the not-so-much-a-sequel to the one we watched monday.  then.... played some guitar.  then i was forced to sing a few songs.  sabrina says i should try out for jesus, in jesus christ superstar at the bradley, but i dunno.  also, i work second shift. so. yeah.  so yeah i tried to sing. and then... sabrina made tea, and we walked to phs cause she had jazz band, and had a reminiscent chat on the way.  then my dad was 30 minutes late to pick me up (hes cool like that), and now i am here. sitting, doing nothing as usual.  blehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i need to get a car.  26 days till i can drive.  seems like a long time...  i also get a raise then though.  thatll be nice.

aiight, im hungry. so i think im gonna go do something about that.  i smell tacos in my near future.

oh yeah, and im gonna try to update this all the time again, for you people who read it everyday and whatnot. *cough*

yes, it is actually what time the entry says it is, like 3:50 or something insane like that.  why? because i am insane.  and i did infact battle wireless networks and ladybug attacks to bring you guys this entry. so be grateful, dammit.

ummmmm i dont really have anything else to say.  i am still awake cause i cant sleep cause i keep getting attacted my ladybugs as they have overrun my room.  and my wireless network seems to work randomly when i DONT need it to (like right now, at 4 AM)... it never works during the day or at any sane time.  and its working perfectly now but once morning rolls around, it will be fucked again. i dont understand.  oh well.  

i hope you burn in hell, or your religions eqivalent of hell. or... fuck it.  i hope you burn to death, in a volcano.  that way it applies to anyone.  no, im not saying that everyone should die in a ball of fire.  just a select few who know who they are.  and i doubt they even read this.

so  anyway.


i got a new guitar.  it is in fact a very old guitar.  32 years old actually. a 1972 gibson ""sg professional"" to be exact.  and its a little bit fucked up, so if anyone knows of a place i can get it fixed, lemme know.  its red and black if you wanted to know.

i think thats enough middle of the night rambling for now.  oh yeah, sunday night i had two seizures and was in the ER for a while.  means i cant drive for a month or two, but other than that its not really a big deal.  so stop asking me if im feeling better.

"event","so today wasnt such a bad day, i feel suprisingly good. i am not sure why.  lets see.

as usual erin picked me up in the morning and we went to communications (i really should thank her more often for the rides, since shes always on time and otherwise getting to school would be a bitch) and that was generally fun and not so bad.  we worked on purpose statements for our big speech.  i thought of mine in the parking lot at school.

after that, matt and erin decided they werent going to class, and i decided english was hopeless, so i filled out another add/drop form and went in search of my super cool teacher, Julius.  i finally found him when he pranced into his office at about 12.  so after that, we all went to burger king to get lunch since its the only place that has veggie burgers for erin.  then matt had to work so we brought him back to his car at school and then headed to erins house.

on the way there, her cd player started freaking out, so we made it a plan to fix the stupid thing while we were there.  i also tried to fix her computer, but was semi unsucessful.  its being kind of a bitch.  but we did manage to fix the cd player i think, i reconnected a wire and straightened it out so that her dashboard is no longer hanging off like it was before.  so no more rattleing on the highway.  it then proceeded to be dumb... but then stopped. *knock on wood*  

so then, erin had to do some shopping.  not just any kind of shopping, she had to do some bathing suit shopping.  i of course, was totally up for that as i take great interest in womens clothing... *cough*... what?  so she managed to extort $40 from her parents and we headed up to target since they supposedly had one there that she liked.  well first we stopped at my house to get cds and my cell phone, but THEN we went to target.  of course, they didnt have it in her size, and there were no other super cool ones there. so we went next door to coles, and after much hunting she found a suitable replacement for a whopping $44 on sale.  so then we headed back towards webster, and listened to some led zeppelin.  we were busy talkinga bout something and missed the proper exit (2) and were forced to get off at 1 and backtrack to get gas. *sigh*.  so then she had to go to a doctors appointment with her mom at 7 so she dropped me off here, just moments ago. 

my parents should be home soon, i think we are having left over tacos for dinner, and then i have to go back to QV for my class at 8 (business law), one of the 2 classes i have left... hmm. so yeah.  that ends at 9:30, at which point i am probably gonna come home and just go to BED since i have to be at wal mart at fuckin 7 tomorrow for cashier training and CBL (computer based learning).  apparantly im late with that... shit. i need a car.  i  can do it whenever... i just have no way to get to wal mart.  DAMN me for not having a car *kicks self*.  so i might buy my grandfathers super cool escort wagon, its green, and a standard.  but i fucking hate fords, so i dunno.  i would rather buy scotts fucked up golf and get it fixed.  (hey, i have a parts car already)

that is all for now."

also, i am sucking at school.  i dropped math cause i hadnt been in over a month, and i am pretty sure that tomorrow i will be dropping english since its my last chance to do so and it looks pretty hopeless. leaving me with 2 classes, which is 6 credits.  so hopefully i wont get dropped from my parents insurance.  if i do, oh well, its not like i have a car to drive anyway.

lets see. so if i can get full time at wal mart, it will suck.  but i should be able to rake in almost $250 a week.  which means, that maybe i actually could move out.  and maybe i could get my own apartment, and live by myself and hate everyone from a distance.  at least for a while till i finally decide its time to give up on this whole hating people thing, and this whole trying to do something with my life thing.  it seems like its probably not going anywhere.

i was looking at this school called musictech college. its in minnesota.  seems that i could go there and get a degree in music production. thatd be cool, but first i would have to get in.  hahahahaa. right.  whats my gpa? oh yeah... somewhere between 0.67 and 3.0  whats that?  hmm something like a ... 2.25 or something.  oh boy.

so i finished recording our one song today, definately not happy with it.  the sound card on my computer sucks, so it came out shitty. i kind of want to do it all over again.  because its really shitty.  not that matt sang bad, or i fucked it up, it just sounds bad, cause my sound card is a piece of shit.  

so, im selling my red guitar to hollis taylor i think, for 300, which is pretty cool cause maybe then i can buy an interface for my computer and redo the whole recording. of our one song. that i am starting to hate.  or maybe i could write something new... oh wait. nope.

i was supposed to write a purpose statement for communications. and do the paper that was due wednesday. didnt so much do either.  i think im gonna do the purpose statement when i get to class tomorrow, then drop english, then do the communications paper and bring it in wednesday, maybe. i dunno.  it seems kinda futile.  i should pass that class though, its not so bad.  that and business law. my teacher is pretty cool.  

so im listening to elliott smith, its some good stuff.  certainly doesnt cheer me up at all though.

so whats with girls around here and me being everyones friend and everyones guy to talk to about guy problems?  gettin kinda lonely so if anyone likes me youre gonna have to let me know cause im not catching any signals from anyone and its kinda sucking.  :-/ if your looking for me im probably hanging out with matt seeing as thats all i ever do these days.  go to school (not to class), play pool, then hang out with matt and/or erin, and then go home and wish i wasnt at home.  when really its not like theres anything else to do anyway.  

i kinda wish i was drunk. all the time. itd make everything suck a little bit less. i gotta work on that, the getting drunk, or something

go away."

"event","so i am kinda bored, its nearly three am, and im just hanging out as usual. i definately slept till 5:30 today so i am not tired at all, dammit.  

yesterday i went to center pizza with matt and erin and chris (my brother) and then we all went to johnny d's house to drop off a cd, which turned into hanging out there for a while.  and then erin had to get her car, and chris didnt want to go to savage, so matt went to bring them home.  i stayed at johns because of 1. lack of seating in the car and 2. johan and i had some music stuff to work on.  so we did that, we have a cool new song that has some linear drumming in it, sounds nifty.  so then erin and matt came back and we all went to savage (oh what a wonderful place).  we didnt actually go in, cause it was just a bunch of shitty metal bands, instead we played lacrosse int he parking lot and hung out with roland and some other people.  i take that back, i did go in once, but it was only to take a piss.  so yeah.. then erin had to go home cause of her cerfew and whatnot, and matt and i... well. we went to this party and met steph there, who was completely... i mean... COMPLETELY inebriated.  beyond drunk.  by the time we convinced her to let us drive her home she couldnt even walk to the car.  so that was interesting... after that we drove around.. went to bickfords, matt dropped 13 bucks on a steak, then we drove around some more and i think we eventually wound up in sturbridge, and then got home at like 5ish.  so then i took some nyquil and went to bed
-- flash foreward 12 hours--
5:30 pm today, my mom wakes me up, says erin called half an hour ago, so i try to call her back but shes not there... so then i get in the shower, and she calls back right as i am getting out to say that although she wasnt sposed to be working... and called in to make sure she wasnt... they then called her in, so she was on her way there.. so i just hung out for a while. and then at 8 i called matt and since my dad was going to wal mart anyway i went there with them and met mat there. and we went to his casa to hang out and whatnot.  so we... hung out for a few mins, played gutiar, erin called on her break. then matt went to take a shwoer, and i started playing need for speed underground.  at which point erin called back cause she got outa work early.  so she began on her journey over to matts, still wearing her work clothes since she couldnt go home without being stuck there.. so then we all hung out for a few mins before we decided to watch pulp fiction (good movie).  unfortunately, erin was not a fan of all the needles, and had to be home at 1, so she left about halfway through, missing a lot of the great parts. *sigh* she shall have to watch it again. so then matt and i finished watching that, and he brought me home, and here i am being an insomniac again. YAY

so thats my story and i'm stickin to it.

ummmmmmmmm so since i have nothing interesting to talk about other than telling my life story, thats probably all you're gonna get for a while for anyone who reads this, at least until something interesting happens to me.

"event","band practice was... meh.  it always feels so unproductive because we lack all the necessary intruments... so it just sounds thin.... i am growing to hate the sound of just drums and guitar, we need fucking bass and keys before i kill something. RAR.  so yeah that sax part i wrote sounded cool by itself, but clashes horribly with matts vocal melody... time to rewrite that one.  also, i dont know how to play wind instruments so i kinda didnt include any rests for breathing and whatnot.... hmmmmm.... i dunno.  ithink maybe andrea should try writing those, once we map out the vocal melody for her to go on.  so yeah... we did that.

then afterwards, me, john, and erin went to mcdonalds and sat around for oh... .2hours or so.... talked about various ""stuff"" and ""things"", it was quite interesting.  at one point john said something like ""its snowing in napkin land!"" and tossed napkins all over the table. 

to me, at that moment, that was the single funniest thing in the whole world and i laughed so hard and so long i thought i was gonna throw up my cheeseburger.  mmmm.

but then we had no lives so erin went home and we dropped john off. matt and i then went on our quest for something to do.

by reading this, you will be able to have ALMOST as much fun as actually being there, without the risk of death or dismemberment.

1.  call a few people... while driving all around putnam.  that gets old
2.  drive to rhode island (for about 2-3 miles) and then turn around
3.  follow car from rhode island on back roads all the way to their driveway in thompson.  stop in front of their driveway and stare for a few seconds... then drive away.
4.  we went to webster, drove around, then went to
5.  dudley, then got
6.  lost in charlton, but i recognized ""buffenville park"" from when i almost got E Coli there a year and a half ago with joellen and harrison, and managed to find out way to
7. teds package and then to
8. southbridge and then to
9. woodstock which led us back into
10. putnam so we got on rt 12 and headed to 
11. dayville where we went to dunkin doughnuts.  matt got a soda and an apple pie (cold) which he didnt eat cause it was gross cold. (they offered to heat it, he refused).  then some wierd old guys came in and we left
12.  accidentally yelled ""NEGRO"" at black homeless man walking down 101 (it was an accident)
13.  drove across the street to the back of the movie theater parking lot, since nothing with a bathroom was open at this point (2:30ish)
14.  as we were leaving, 2 cars pulled in.  we figured they were gonna go fuck so we were glad we were leaving.
15.  with nothing better to do, we decide of course to go to 
16. lisbon wal mart.  this is the super duper 24 hour walmart.  we wandered around here for a good long time, bouncing basketballs, hiding squeaky puffy pigs with funny noses, and other fun things.
17.  lacking money we then headed off to 7 eleven, where matt got a coke smoothie and i got some cherry coke.  he also got a candy bar of some sort.
18. decided to take rt 12 all the way home from lisbon
19.  suddenly, death.... and fog and hail and pouring rain, began to fall from the sky.  thus begins the
20.  ""don't die game"".  needless to say, we won the dont die game since we are still alive.  the dont die game consists of driving through heavey fog in pouring rain on curvy roads that you dont know at all.  the object of the game is to not die.  we are pretty good at it i think, we only almost died once a few weeks ago.
21.  after a thrilling game of the dont die game, we finnally got home, and proceeded to go online. where we are right now. doing nothing.

so that was our super eventful night.  dont you wish you were as cool as us?  if so, let us know, you can hang out with us sometime...... 

goodnight

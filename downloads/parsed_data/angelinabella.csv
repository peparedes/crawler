"event","Well, tomorrow afternoon I get to go to the Doctor and find out if I'm with child or not...  It's funny, because there is absolutely no way that I could be pregnant, but my Doctor refuses to take ""No"" for an answer.  It all started 2 weeks ago, when I got sooo sick.  I got really dizzy, I felt like I was going to pass out, and my stomach was so queasy that I wanted to throw up, because I felt it would make me feel better.  Well, after a few days of this, I decided to go to the Doctor's office.  The minute I told her what was happening, she immediately diagnosised me as being pregnant.  I insisted that there was absolutely no way that I could be pregnant(I haven't had sex), but she insisted on me peeing in a cup.  I went ahead and did my business in the cup, just to prove to her that she was wrong and that I was actually sick.  So, the test comes back negative (as I knew it would) and she says to me ""Well, your test came back Negative, but that doesn't mean anything, I still think your pregnant.""  Then she instructed me to take TUMS and Vitamin C tablets, and come back in two weeks for another pregnancy test.  So, now it's two weeks, my stomach is still a little weird, but it's nothing like before.  Oh, I joked with a friend that the unborn fetus in my tummy must be Jewish, because Jesus was Jewish and conceived through ""immaculate conception"" So, I've decided that since my baby was conceived in the same manner he must also be Jewish and I'm naming him Ishmael.  I know I'm weird, I chose my Doctor based on her last name.  Her last name is Gabor (like Zsa Zsa or Eva)so that's why I decided to go to her.  I'm gone."

"event","Have you ever had a friend that, from the moment you met them, you just felt instantly, I don't want to say ""attracted to"", but there was something about this friend that just made you want to surround yourself with that person, get to know everything about them, because you were just soooo curious?  And then for some strange and curious reason, you really wanted this particular friend's approval?  For the past few months, I have been striving so hard to get the approval of one person, who was just fascinating to me.  I mean, there wasn't much about this person, but perhaps it was the things that I didn't know, that just fueled my desire to learn more.  I thought the world of her, put her needs above my own, and then when I really needed her she bailed.  I understand that everyone has their own demons that they need to battle, but I don't think they should use their friends as punching bags.  I was a rock for her, when her whole world crumbled down around her, there I was emerging from the ruins with a little ray of hope.  You know, I think of all the happy memories that we shared, but for some reason they seem to get buried by all the bad ones.  For every good thing about our relationship, there are probably a dozen bad things.  I'm nervous for her, I'm afraid she's on self-destruct mode, and now that she's no longer a part of my life, I'm afraid only bad things are gonna start happening to her.  Everyone keeps telling me to forget about the situation, that I don't need her, that she brings me down, or she was only using me, but honestly, how do you make that original feeling go away?  How do you truly stop caring for someone, who only a few months ago, was the center of your universe?  * Note to boyfriend ""No honey, she and I did not sleep together, even though I know how badly you wanted it to happen, and how badly you wanted it videotaped."""

"event","I can not wait for the Summer!  Winter is hell, I seriously feel 10 years have been knocked off my life expectancy because of all this snow!  I actually had fun playing with the snowblower, and for those of you that know me, you realize how funny an image that can be.  I had no idea how to even start it.  There were all these buttons and knobs, and god forbid I remember to put the key in and turn it to start.  I swear, I should have been a blonde.  And that's not a knock on the blondes of the world, I just feel that if I used (and let set into my scalp) a lot of bleach and peroxide in my hair it would account for how ditzy I am."

"event","Wow, what an exciting day!  I fought with an evil witch in Brighton, came home to face my own demons, met a cute little Pug-el, watched some poor gerbils (or were they hamsters?) get bum raped, and then screamed the lyrics to Faithfully and Open Arms with my home girl at the top of our lungs! And I feel guilty cause this dumb broad at Bath and Body works gave me an extra hand soap by accident.  Is that considered stealing?  If you get out of the mall, right when it closes, and realize that you have merchandise you didn't pay for?  I just took a shower, but I still smell like dog.  I was amused in Spencer Gifts when I found a t-shirt that said ""I'm Rick James, Bitch!""  reminded me of my days with my buddy Mike.  I can't wait for tomorrow, I'm going to escape to my favorite place, with two of my favorite people, get massages and eat chocolate covered gummy bears until I puke...life is sweet."

"event","This is the first time, I've ever done this.  I only hope that the people that really know me are not reading this...  I've gone through so many emotions today.  I'm afraid I may becoming psychotic.  My love affair with my pseudo boyfriend is taking over my well-being.  I've been thinking alot about breaking up with him again, but we both seem to come back to each other, after one of us has called it quits.  He's an Aries and I'm a Capricorn...so, not a good match.  It aggrivates me when we fight because I'm a fighter- I always have valid points.  He's irratic and tries to retreat which only gets me more angry because no one likes to fight with someone who won't fight back.  It's like he puts up this wall and then tries to ignore what I have to say.  I think he's afraid of the truth.  He's significantly older than I am.  And you would think he would be the mature one, but no...  We have this weird pattern that we constantly follow.  We have a few weeks of happiness, followed by 2 weeks of total hell and heartbreak.  We reach that end, the end that would be over for any sane couple.  And then when either one of us has said that's it, the other grovels until we're back together again.  Then we slowly go back to happiness, and then the whole cycle begins all over again.  I love my boyfriend, I just wish that our relationship was more easy rather than more complicated."

"event","Watching documentaries on TV. A raspy, so-called pleasant voice of the narrator. Tantric. Hardy. A funny combination, really. Titles rolling, heads too. A child in the man's arms. Chocolate coating. Time to switch. One up, right into void. Another, into more narration, gross-out images of little importance. changes needed. We're at the beginning, seeing someone we know. But it takes just too damn long, so we lose patience. Funny men. Good, even if forced. Silence on number three letters in colour. Going more and more, to where the film resides. Information abound. Useless, speculative, commercial, selfpromoting. With a british accent. And we're where we started. Where to go now?

Solid Ice. A fine title. Makes you wonder what could be behind it. Makes you wonder if you have got it in you to make something of it. Giant inchworm. Not so fine title. There's a not so fine line between good and not good. And no one to locate it. Dreams of glory, daydreams of little importance. Been used twice. What does that say about the writer? A something little that started all this, went on for all two lines before dying a slow but sure death:

It was a little, hairy creature. How peculiar. She squatted, looming over, a towering giant in the creature's eyes. What was it thinking? Was it thinking?

I like it. The idea. I know where I'd like to take it. I know the effect I'd like to achieve. I've little knowledge how to get there. It will be tapping in the dark. Days and weeks and years in the making, perhaps. Not the two lines here. Probably two million lines, yet unveiled. Possibilites. It will do, pig. Now, off to tomorrow."

"event","Layers of metal and artificial fibre strain and shatter under the overwhelming pressure enveloping the hull, followed by a rainstorm of scorching debris scarring the ship's underside, scarring the Beast.

Inside, the command bridge is silent, people at their stations, strapped to their seats, some faces drenched in sweat, other give away a prayer spoken in their mind, all visibly uneased.

Noise disappeares, light seen through the few small window panes give way to complete darkness of space once again. The ship is still in one piece. Starboard thrusters blast away, rotating the immense mass, hiding the ripped and bleeding underbelly as the bow thrusters aim the shielded front towards the incoming.

Inside, a fast exchange of orders and confirmations, chain of command on show, human input converging with the processing power of the artificial brains.

Outside, just beyond the shielded bow, large cannons appear from the openings in the hull plating. A moment of adjusting follow, then a silently fired salvo of projectiles that melds with the darkness.

Twenty seven kilometers away, an fleet of many begins to scatter, large carriers opening their bowels, launching small attack gunships. A large group with red insignia on the nose leads. First one shatters in thousands of pieces, blown away, as the fired projectiles cut through the swarm of gunships, scattering them and disintegrating two more, flying through.

Their final target, though, remains. Vast shadow covering the sun, outline of a massive carrier. They hit, striking the starboard side, cutting into it before going out through the port side. Explosion roars inaudibly, severing the ship in half before setting off a chain of smaller detonations along its hull. One down, too many more to go. 

Gunships cut the distance in half, letting go of their payload. Space floods with sparkling stars, lit engines propelling the rockets. Moments later, as they approach the Beast, they're rained upon by its autocannons, making a veil of blasts engulfing the weakened ship. Rockets detonate left and right, struck and blown away, four, three, two kilometers away. Too few. 

The rest make an impact, a series of blows devouring the enormous metal body, opening the old scars, making new ones, tearing the Beast in parts. Layers of metal and artificial fibre strain and shatter under the overwhelming blasts of pressure enveloping the hull. Life ceases. Light subsides. Beast is no more, only debris where it once stood, flying away in various directions."

"event","""Do you think they will ever come out?""
""I've no idea"" Alex shrugged her shoulders.

Right. Suddenly the missed opportunity to babysit that witness on the Capra case seemed like a real good deal. Jake played with his fingers, staring numbly at the floor. Three full days. And nothing, not even a face out of the window on that building across theirs.

""Do you think it's possible these are some kind of decoys?"" Jake asked again, glancing at the computer screen, connected to a IR sensor looking out of their window, hidding behind the curtain.

Alex's eyes followed the black and white image, human shapes sitting at the table, maybe playing cards or something. ""You can't fake this. No way.""

""But wouldn't you go crazy not going out of the house? Even to go to the store? How do they get their food?""

""I told you someone else gets them food. It has to be someone else."" Alex rummaged through a couple of folders with pictures. ""I'm tipping on Mrs. Finch here, apt. 4B.""

""Wanna play ch...""
""No Jake, not again."" Alex's voice was genuinely tired.

Sounds of silence filled the room for several moments again, as much as that was possible with the traffic out in the street, soft hum of the computers on the table near the window and Jake's fumbling with the amp connected to the shotgun microphone, keeping the camera and IR sensor company.

""They're not even talking. And when they do there's always that damn music on. I can distinguish maybe every tenth word they say."" Jake sighed.

Alex pulled up her laptop, typing away. Jake was dangerously close to start picking his nose but instead he opted for merely playing with the stubble of two day hair on his unshaven chin. 

Moments passed, typing ceased, it seemed as if even the traffic outside stopped, alongside with the time.
 
""Screw this. Do you want to go get some coffee?"" Alex got up from her chair, grabbing her coat.
""God, I thought you'd never ask."""

"event","I've got that class at 5, it rings in my head after glancing at the digits on the digital clock. They change to 4:41 and I think to myself I should be going in five minutes time. I should also call Daniel, tell him about the new plan for Saturday, he'll have to find more people to help us. I walk around the room, mobile phone in hand, calling. The line is busy. I make a pit stop at the toilet, grabbing the phone again as I come out, making another call. It rings.

I say hi. He says hi. How's wife? She's fine. What's the news? I explain it to him, what happened, what was said to me, I say everything I know. We settle what we're gonna do about it. I chuckle at his joke. What about the next weekend, he asks. Well, we could ask Fred, do it at his place. Uh huh, he responds, then goes on to tell me why that's not such a good idea. I ask what would he do, he doesn't know. Typical, I shake my head then go on offering another idea. Yes, he likes that one better.

Can you help me with buying that new computer monitor I mentioned? I say yes. He goes on about the specifications, I listen and give my opinion. What about the equipment, he then asks out of the blue. For this weekend? Everything's taken care of. Thats good, he laughs, makes another joke. I run with it, joking with him. His wife said that? I can't believe it. Yes, we definitely should have our wives meet, who knows what would happen.

What about the money, am I gonna pay for everything, he asks. I nod, pointing out I'd need to be reimbur... - Fuck me! I'm so sorry but I have to go, I'm late, Bye! I hang up panicking, grabbing my bag and rushing to get the shoes on. The clock reads 4:58 and I slam the door, fumbling with the keys. How the fuck could have I been so stupid? I always do this, fuck fucking fuckshit! I run out of the building knowing I'd be 10 minutes late yet again all smelly from running."

"event","Stooge was behind them, ready to start moving on the given signal. Fingers clutching the cold of the metal tripod, he was a wheel in a bigger mechanism, unimportant by himself, but of some significance in the whole picture. Or so he secretly hoped for, as he thought of the reasons why he was standing there in the first place. It wasn't that bad, at least he had a warm jacket on him. 

Some meters behind him, four of his colleagues, three guys and a girl. Some meters more behind them, two more girls, shivering in the cold, not being able to dress normally as they'd want like the others. Suddenly, instead of a green light, the main guy yelled red. 

Two girls ran towards us, left one asking for people to hug her, as she was dressed particulary skimpily, she was so cold. Stooge laughed at that in himself, then sensed people's eyes on him, their looks. He was the only guy with a jacket on. By the time he realized what he is to do, the girl, the colleague, was already giving the shivering one her jacket. She too gave him the look.

Some minutes passed. More preparations. Then, they were on the move. So was stooge, watching carefully not to get in anyone's way. Quickly they moved, quickly he walked in front of them, keeping occupied by a silly game of trying to exhale a breath of air in as much narrower stream as possible. It was cold. Three minutes passed, it was time for a break.

They all stopped and mingled, Stooge found himself closest to the shivering girls. An order was made, that he leaves his current position and goes away to take another one. As he was starting to move to do just that, the skimpily dressed girl ran into his way asking him to put his arms around her. He didn't realize why she was asking it and just awkwardly layed the palms of his hands around her. Yet he didn't have time to that, he was ordered to go. 

He let go of her and, as he was making his first steps away from the group he heard the colleague girl telling him ""I thought you'd follow my example earlier."", giving the shivering girl her jacket once more. More looks. Or at least he saw them in his head. In a second, he found himself jumping in the air a little, out of sheer frustration, a sure sign of how mad he was at himself. Yet, he had a mission. He had to go.

More time passed. He was sitting on the bench, on his new position. A chance of possible partial redemption came, in the way of the two girls coming his way. He took off his jacket, offering it, but the previously shivering girl didn't want it. They passed him by.

And so, slowly, it all ended. In a boom of a sort, even if he wasn't involved in it. Everyone packed up and they all went home. As he was sitting in the back of the van, among equipment, he watched the dawn rise through the dirty glass. World seemed sleepy and sad. He knew some people would forget the night, he also knew some wouldn't."

Ships off the coast of fog, mill through the wakes of the waves made before them. Gentle whisper baths them, lulls them in their sleep. Like stone watchmen, they wait, moss engulfing them as the water gives way to sand. Winds push and prod, lightstorms roll, grinding away. Nothing remains.

Strumming across the hair, booming into the open. Voices caressing the walls, reverberating, joining the boom. Silent souls, open eyes, closed, humming, twining around waves sailing above them. Speeding up, louder, crecsendo looming, imminent. Darkness of the skies giving way to technicolor.

With clouds they went, rode, galloped into the dawn reflected off their shields. Another death, another warrior, plunged into the abyss of the blues of the sea, waited for salvation. Shore never reached, achieved, music played in their ears. Final destination waited for them, all along."

"event","The book was boring. She closed it, put it away, stacking it on the top of a lumbering tower of novels that preceeded it and exhaled deeply. Glancing at her watch she knew she didn't have anything else to do for three more hours. Her eyes roamed around the room, searching, hoping to notice something of interest.
Walls were covered with posters and drawings, of legends and myths, fairies and hollywood tries to bring them to life. On shelves there were works ranging from E.A.Poe to Stephen King, from H.P. Lovecraft to R.R. Martin, accompanied by several wicca handbooks and rest of the similarly themed stuff that you'd find in a second hand 'everything for 5 dollars' bookstore. Her fingers tapped alongside the surface of her desk as she was trying to decide is it worth looking through the window. As if she could see something fun from the first floor looking into a blind alley. Being grounded sucked.

Her hand went for the nearby pencil almost instinctively, flipping it between fingers, playing with it. Her mind was sluggish, tired, even if she felt quite awake and detested the idea of going back to bed after she already slept hours more than necessary that day. She detested her mother, too. Well, that's too strong of a word, of course, but they young girl's mind couldn't quite agree with her mother's view on curfews, especially since school was over. Lanie must be out with girls, she thought, furrowing her thin eyebrows. Her hand stood still, her eyes swaying towards the pencil. It was standing upright, on its rubber end. ""Did I just do that?"" she wondered, a glimpse of a smile appearing on her lips before the pencil fell over, rolled down the desk and ended up in the trash bin on the floor. 

She sighed and picked the pencil up, putting back on the edge of the desk. Crap. Having music would help. If only her dear mother didn't think to include that too in the terms of being grounded. If only she remembered to take the walkman with her instead of leaving it in her jacket pocket. If only... She shut her eyes closed, listening to the hum in her mind, making music of her own. Crap. What do to? Laying on the bed, she focused on yellow, wet spot on the ceiling above her. She wondered what odds are there that a drop forms on it and falls right on the tip of her nose. Come on, fall. Boring, boring, bored. Something to happen.

Doorknob turned and girl's mother appeared on the doorstep. 
""What are you doing?"" she asked. 
""What do you mean? I didn't do anything.""
""I told you not to play any music.""
""I didn't..."" Girl's voice went silent in a second. She was hearing music. Glancing at the stereo she was even more perplexed. ""Stereo is off, mom. I'm playing anything.""

Yet the music was definitely originating somewhere from the room. Soft, gentle, humming a mellow tune.

""Turn it off."" Mother said, her voice cold.
""I didn't turn it on. I don't know where it's coming from.""

For a moment mother's face went all red as if she was about to go into another one of her raging fits but then she just turned on her heel and stormed out of the room. The girl knew that wasn't good. The door remained opened, and she could hear the yelling coming from the living room. Within moments she could expect father coming up, all hell breaking loose. Her fingers instinctively went for the doorknob, shutting it closed, wishing there was a key she could turn. Like a trapped animal. She didn't want him to come up. She didn't want to be here. Closing her eyes she pictured a sun lit meadow, deserted, peaceful. If only she could be there now. Her father's footsteps, inching closer to the door snapped her out of the image. He would come in the room any second now. Her thoughts ran in thousand directions, scared, lost as she bumped against the desk, her hand gripping its edge, feeling the pencil underneath the trembling fingers. Any moment now, she knew, door would open, yelling would start. Meadow, waterfall, woods, her mind raced over most random images without any control. 

Door opened, girl's fingers clenched around the pencil, her father's voice boomed in her head, she felt her heart ache, she wanted it all to stop and go away. He would come closer, she knew, her skin already felt the burn she knew would come. Go away! Girl's eyes still closed in fear, her hand rose and protected her cheek. Get away! The pencil flew, out of nowhere, flung out of her fingers even though she didn't throw it.

Silence. A second must've passed. Girl opened her eyes and saw her father, watching her, his right arm extended, palm making a stop sign, pencil levitating in front of it, in midair. 

His face gave away a mix of anger and satisfaction. ""What the hell do you think you're doing?"""

Janice was on his left, reading some book, chuckling at it (with it?) every now and then, quietly of course. Mrs. Derringer sat at her desk, reading an old issue of Vanity Fair, playing with her spectacles.

Little Debbie flung her Barbie (tm) into the wall, throwing another anger fit, eyes all teary, shouting off the top of her lungs. Within seconds, Mrs. Heckler ran into her room, started waving her hands around, shouting herself. Outside, through the window, neighbour Bob could be seen looking up, pausing the mowing of his lawn.

Little Timmy looked up at the skies, grasping the old, damp bricks, stepping out of the dirty water that surrounded his knees. He wailed, called out Mr. Winchester's name, then stood still waiting to hear some reply. None came and his cheeks once again filled with tears. He struggled, trapped in the well.

Little Susie held the violin firmly, strumming, her eyes closed. She imagined playing in front of her teacher, humming while she played. Mr. Wesson, sitting next to her, looked up at the ceiling and groaned. He wasn't thrilled with her music but he loved the fact her 60 minutes were drawing to a close. 

Little kettle whistled, singnaling the tea is ready. The Gunn family sat around the table, four of the kids giggling and teasing each other while the parents tried to make them behave. ""How was your day?"" Mrs. Gunn asked them. ""Same old."" Kids replied, waiting for the little teapot to be brought to the table."

I've past from general uneasiness to frustration to 'ah screw it' to more frustration and despair. The whole time the little piece of meat stayed logged in, perfectly happy pissing me off, probably even having a blast doing it.

I pretend there's nothing wrong. A minute passes, even too, I hope my mind will just forget about it, get used to the filled out space between teeth... I fail miserabely. One last groan, furrowing of the eyebrows, painstaingly precise tongue sucktion. Nothing changes.

"event","Little furry animals. I still have them. I look back at when I got them, I remember, I know almost every one. The fuzzball turtle I got from my boyfriend for my 19th birthday. The long haired lion cub I won at the fair that summer of '99. The little button eyed bunny I got when my brother grew too old for it. I read about some people, I think they call themselves 'furries' or something, which dress up as stuffed animals... They just give them a bad name, I feel. But for real, for what they are, they are memories. Real, warm, fuzzy feelings, fuzzy to remember and fuzzy to snuggle with.

Now the bedside where they laid is empty. I can see the cracked wall, so plain and lacking. Sure I could buy new ones, but it's not just fuzz, I could cuddle with a pillow if I needed that. I need him. I look at the boxes on the floor and I feel cold. There will be room for some, not so for others. Suddenly I feel so old and unnecessarely mature. I need the fuzzball under my fingers, running through them.

I hear the footsteps, I go to the window, I stain the glass one last time, knowing I'll probably be the only one to even notice it's stained in my new place. I wonder if I miss being nagged about it. I hear the last boxes being taken out. I see neighbor Bob washing his car outside. God damn bastard. I turn around, look around the room. Empty. Wet spot on the ceiling clearly visible. Mrs. Gibson, apartmant across the wall, moving her furniture again. Wooden floors, so loud, so old. Well, goodbye to that. It's time."

"event","It reminded her of summer, some ten years ago, when her bicycle hit a rock and she flew out of her seat, landing not so softly on her chin. Her hand immediately felt out the skin, feeling the still present mark. 

The young man with the scar lowered his head, leaning more on the wall and escaping back into his novel. She didn't dare looking at her watch, knowing it's been way too long now and that the day's passing in vain. She wondered since when the young man was here. If only she brought something to pass time, like he did.

The hallway went into dimly lit haze on her left, doors upon doors peeking out of the walls. The bit where they waited was at least brightly lit, probably trying to repair the damage done by the gloomy gray and broken paint. The blue painted door she was facing was locked.

Her fingers twirled her hair, she stared at the crack in the large tile, just one of many on the floor, not unlike the ones her grandpa had outside the house, leading through the garden. It was still hard to forgive herself for not crying on his funeral. It wasn't a thought she enjoyed to reminisce.

Her legs hurt, she had to move them. Had to walk to the window, again fumbling with it, again taking a minute to open it and get some spring air. There's little buds on the trees, she didn't notice that before.

The man sitting on the floor across her had a stubby, sparse beard. Could it be he waited for days here? Lame joke, her brain cackled at her. The man then rose, putting away with his novel. Footsteps she heard approaching made her curse and smile at the same time. Who would go first?"

He was calm. Perfectly crouched, hidden behind the large wooden crate, we watched the little action he could see from his vantage point. Must've been quite some time now, but he didn't even feel the weight of the massive sniper rifle in his hands.

At times, he'd look through the scope, scout out the surroundings, then lower the gun down a little, getting a broader perspective without the scope. Movement. Quickly he looked through the scope again, struggling to see what was going on. The finger on the trigger remain still, however. It was a small group od his squadmates, running towards him, their blue insignia barely visible. It could mean only one thing.

He turned around, a full 180 degree turn, laying prone onto the floor for lower detectability. In his scope, the blue flag gently waving in the wind. He rose the rifle to the air ducts right behind it. They could be coming any second now. He saw the leftmost air duct quite clearly, no one was coming out of it. The right one, however, was just out of his sight, as he could observe only its edge. What if they're already there, hiding behind the corner?

The squad that he expected was just nowhere to be seen. Maybe they've been shot, engaged, dealt with. Not happy about the possibility of fucking campers lurking around, the man with the sniper rifle crawled out of his sheltered position, inching more to the side until the air duct was exposed to his eyes. Then a shot hit his head, killing him momentarely."

I had no idea my punch would be so powerful. She watched, i felt like vomiting. I felt like being no more, I wanted to disappear. And I did, in front of woman's eyes. Her panicking look still hurts in my brain. I ran, I almost got ran over half a dozen times, then finally got hit by a speeding car. How can i run so fast? Why couldn't I have seen my hands, my legs, my body just minutes ago? That car was going at least 40, why don't I have a scratch on me?

It never ceases to amaze me. They always think they can beat me, always so full of themselves. Then I grab them, then the fear comes. It's almost fun, guessing when they'll start fearing me. I look at him now and i almost feel sorry for him. Crying, broken jaw. Should've thought that before you went into the store with a gun, moron. Why should just you get the prize? Police won't know who took it anyway. I'm sick of doing all this night in, night out for nothing.

I eat the last bit of the sandwich. News on the tv is filled with stuff I hate. It's not my problem, okay? Police should do its work. I watch the screen then turn the damn thing off. Looks better, all dark. I stare in the wall. I look down and stare in my hand. I make it invisible, first just the finger, then the whole fist. I stare. Yawning, I take the phone and make the call. ""Alice? Hey, It's me. I've got some time this weekend, finally. If you wanted to go get that cup of coffee...""

""You don't like it?"" I am hearing myself scream like a madman. But it distand, muffled. ""Do you have any idea what I went through to get it for you?"" She looks at me scared, terrified. ""You said you wanted it!"" I know the bulging vein on my forehead is looking about abnormal to her right now. It is midnight, it is Alice and I, it is her bedroom and she lays on the concrete, her nose bleeding. My hand, on the other hand, doesn't even sting. Like squatting a fly.

Bodies lay. I hear the bones crack as i step over them. I turn invisible and rush toward the remaining squad car. One officer shoots, i feel it but not much more than that. Next second he is dead. I stand over his body and feel the rush. Now, where was I? The bitch was running away from me. I block her way and speak, still invisible. ""Going somewhere?"" She is bloody and beaten. ""I told you to slide those panties down. No one to protect you now."" She cries as my hand appears out of thin air. I do it for her."

"event","Her face looked familiar. Her eyes looked right into him, a lingering second, before she turned her head. She walked slowly, eyeing the rows, touching every other seat she'd pass by. He never felt dirty for watching but the pants on her seemed so impossibly tight. She stopped at his row, her eyes gazing around the room as if she was looking for something in particular. There was just something about that face, his brain obsessed. The lighting in the theatre changed and she became a silhouette.

He could see her moving closer, walking sideways down the narrow space between the seats. The old guy on the far left didn't even seem to notice her, unphased by the back of her thighs that had to rub off him as she was passing him by. She still went on, closer. Just three seats to the left of him, a couple, a pretty young thing with her boyfriend. Their faces got lit a bit here and there, enough for him to see the boyfriend watch the newcomer all while his girl held his hand. The woman didn't stop. 

Passing them by, not slowing down, her face turned to the screen the whole time, her behind just moments from being right in front of him. His legs were wide apart, extended to the seat in front of him yet he didn't move. His eyes watched her waist inch closer to him. He found his hand slide down to his own knee, cupping it, out of control, out of his mind. Her body obstructed his vision, her leg feeling so firm against the hand on the knee, stopping for such a brief moment as she switched her weight to the other leg and moved on. The pants were impossibly snug.

Then she sat down. In a moment, without thinking, out of all the free seats, she sat down to the seat next to his, to his right. He watched straight ahead, couldn't make himself glance at her even for a second. But those eyes, they have watched him before. Moments slid into minutes and more as she remained immobile, those eyes of hers staring ahead.

Slowly, he grew braver, the edges of his vision now catching her legs, her hand on her thigh. Was she so slowly sliding it across her pants? He dared not moving, either his head, his hands or his legs. He could see the outline of her face, starting out in front, making him guilty, making his eyes move to the screen as well. He had been hard for an hour now.

Loud noise rumbled through the speakers, lights flickered on their faces but he could only think of those fingers of hers, her hand moving down her leg, down her inner thigh, then back up. He was not crazy, she was doing it. There could be no room for anything under those pants. Her legs opened up, her knees spread, her left leg almost touching him. It hurt.

It wasn't him anymore. He could see his fingers move, he could feel what they felt, the hard muscle on her thigh, but he didn't do it. Did he? Her eyes remained steady, looking ahead, her body didn't flinch, her own hand didn't move an inch to stop him. He was touching her. Moving up, he expected something, anything, any kind of reaction. He got none. His fingertips slid down her inner thigh, trembling, savouring the warmth. Just an inch more...

He found himself clenching his fist into her flesh, through the thin fabric, stopping in his tracks. What was she doing? It was a flash of a second, but her left hand was now on his pants, the fingers pulling hard on the zipper. Before his mind was aware of it, he could feel her hand, cold, firm grip, grabbing him. His boxers were pulled down, he pulsated hard in her fist, then felt the rush of cold air as she dragged him out of his pants. He cringed in pain, feeling bent and scarred by the zipper, only to get a moment of break before his balls burned as she dragged them out too, all through the opened zipper.

His jaw opened, the hand still on her thigh paralyzed, he felt nothing but her firm squeeze. She was working him so fast he couldn't keep his eyes opened. He knew the couple must be watching yet the only urge he felt was to come. She didn't even stop stroking as he blew over her hand, drenching it and his pants. He couldn't breathe. Finally, her grip loosened and, without pause, her hand pushed him back into the pants, zipping him up neatly. All that was left was the large stain on his new jeans.

She stood up, watching towards the screen, rubbing off his knees as she made her way left, disappearing into the shadows. He struggled for breath, not daring to look any way but ahead. Did he know her?"

It was small, shiny and smooth, the face on its metalic surface reflecting the sun. Ground beneath it turned into mud, mud into frozen, barren soil then back to the soft soil with new fresh blades of green sticking out of it. Light changed and grew and mixed with rain and snow and wind. Little thing grew dark, its surface scarred and dirty.

Ground shook next to it, men yelled, guns roared. A horse galloped, almost stepping onto it. Then all grew calm. A pair of feet would pass by here and there but it was mostly just the little bugs and insects, a worm, maybe a bird plucking it that were its company. More rain and sun and snow and dirt came.

Large metal hand dug it out, alongside with the ground, jackhammers sounded off, lots of pairs of feet with shovels walked around and made the dirt go away, made the ground disappear under the coat of thick asphalt. Little thing got covered, almost lost, dug deep beneath it, sensing the countless rolls of weight overhead.

Another bang, loud, so powerful, lifting the thing and loads of soil in the air. It was hot, scorchingly so. Men screamed again, noise was deafening. But the little thing flew through the air, free, dirtied up but back where it came from. The head on its side was almost smiling."

"event","The watch read 00:17:21. Joanne had less than 20 minutes to pull it off. A feat that many have tried and failed at, she snickered. But she didn't feel at ease. Her head hurt, she felt tired and daydreamed about suspension in time, where nothing moved, no changes passed, time all for herself where she could rest as much as she'd like. Time, however, thought differently. Digits changed to under seventeen minutes and a drop of sweat ran down Joanna's forehead. Like in a bloody Hollywood movie, she thought.

James Spencer lazed on his couch. The game wouldn't start in another fifteen or so minutes so he flipped through the channels, lingering on a pepsi commercial with Britney, flipping fast past the likes of CNN or Fox News. He hoped to God Francine wouldn't come before eight. One lousy day off for himself, that's all he asked for. His stomach craved some deep fried sludge of a food but his brain wondered if it was worth it to actually get off the couch for it.

Faculty seemed empty. Long hallways filled wall to wall with lockers, empty. Everywhere Timmy turned there was just his reflection from the glossed up marble floor looking back at him. No one else. He ran down the south corridor, it seemed like minutes, he was still in the hallway. The French class would be beginning any minute now, he knew. And he was lost.

Neither of them wanted to open their eyes. Clinched between the sheets, they enjoyed the friction their skin produced on each other, enjoyed the sighs they made. It was just smell, sound, touch, it was them away from it all. Dirk and Lorna. Dirk and Lorna Santoro. She thought of how that sounded, and liked it. Dirk felt he was getting close.

The watch read 00:01:54. The clock on the VCR read two minutes to midnight. Time stood still. Time was of no importance."

"event","Their backs leaning against the wall, they sat together on the cold metal floor, almost pressing against each other. They were completely silent, completely still, only thing that gave away the fact they were alive was the breathing and the little puffs of warm air that was being slowly exhaled from their noses. Their helmets, one covered with now frozen blood the other clean but with a large rip through its left side read 'Franz' and 'Stuart', respectively.

Rifles in their hands were cold, almost frozen, almost glued to their fingers that cluthced around them, afraid to move away from the triggers even for a second. Around them, shattered window panes, bullet ridden walls, twisted metal, broken pipes and wiring sticking out of holes in the ceiling. The two was in a dead end of a sort, tightly sealed doors on one side, long dark hallway on the other, exactly the spot where their eyes were aimed at.

Suddenly, the floor shook. Their eyes met, their hands gripped the weapons firmer. A thump followed, resonating across the hallway before finding its way to their ears. Stuart gestured with his hand then changed his position, crouching and lifting the rifle's sight to his eye. Franz nodded and made a few steps across the room, also pointing the rifle towards the hallway. Another thump, louder, closer. Seconds of silence while the overhead light flickered. Then went out. Compltele darkness. Then they came.

Thumps became drumming, fast and ruthless, echoing through the hallway, imminent. In a moment, they swamped the hallway, crawling along the floor, walls, each other. Stuart fired the first round, the small flashlight under his rifle guiding him, eerily calm, just one round, straight into the skull of the leading creature. Franz's gun was louder, a three round burst devouring another creatur's chest. Within a second, the drumming got drowned in the roar of gunfire followed by the dying wails of the incoming.

""Reloading!"" Franz yelled, making Stuart increase his rate of fire, spreading it across the hallway as much as he could. They were still coming, one huge wave of bodies rolling over their fallen, crawling closer. Franz's gun joined him within seconds, barely in time to stop a pouncing creature making it fall just feet away from his feet. More bodies flew apart under the hail of bullets, but still they came. Stuart fired his last shot in the magazine and knew he wouldn't have the time to fire another one.

The gaping jaw rushed toward him as a creature leaped towards him. His hands rose the rifle across his face, protecting from impact but his brain knew it was a feeble attempt. Sounds appeared muffled around him, Franz's cry barely heard as claws ripped through his chestplate. Stuart thought of his of wife."

"event","Frank Smiles was hurting. Goddamn fever was eating him up from inside and there was not a fucking thing he could do about it. All alone, way up in the mountains, in the cottage that he and Laura bought, before she discovered what a good idea it'd be to steal his house and half of his bank account. In the meantime the other half melted away, pretty much like his selfconfidence.

He sometimes wondered if he was the last man alive on earth. Being all alone for weeks, he couldn't know whether the evil aliens killed everyone else. Chances are they didn't but one should never be too sure. His stomach hurt, muscles ached, everything was so hot and he felt rather dizzy. Time to take a little nap. And so Frank Smiles fell asleep.

The horror. The horror. Frank's eyes roamed around his new surroundings in panic as his brain struggled to make sense of them. Twisted metal, living flesh, he couldn't even distinguish what it was. But it smelled awful and it gave him the heebie jeebies. Growl! Frank turned around, locking his eyes on the creature that entered the room. He knew it, this is the end. His mind begged 'Don't kill me, don't kill me!'.

The alien creature stood motionless, watched him, or did whatever that thing that protruded from it's chest was for, and waited. The fear that engulfed Frank finally subsided. Alien smiled and extended its tentacle towards him. Suddenly, Frank realised he wasn't wearing panties."

"event","For the 176th time, a new site/blog/hope. But I'll kinda be mean and use it to better myself. I promise to try to spell correctly without using a spellcheck, watch my grammer and definitely watch the capital letters, something which has been a great thorn in my side ever since i started chatting online. Also, i shall use this stjuuupid (yes, misspelled words on purpose are ok) blog to brush up on my writing skills, as well as my work etiquette. That means a post each and ever day, and i don't mean the 'the weather is nice, my back hurts a little' kind of thing either. Alrighty. Now that we're done with the disclaimer maybe we can even endavour on something beautiful. (suddenly i get this urge to vomit, i wonder why...)"

"event","It started like any other day. He got up, late as usual, did his chores, forgot to brush the teeth (or maybe just didn't care to do it) and sat on a small wooden stool, right next to the window. The neighbour played the Moonlight sonata, easely audible through the thin walls of their building. It seemed more than suiting, as he watched out the window, watched a couple standing on the opposite side of the street, talking, gesturing with their hands. A cyclist passed them by.

He got up for a second only to get his morning dose of nicotine, lighting the cigarette even as he was walking back to the stool. The couple was gone. Exhaled smoke lingered over his head, making it look like he himself was steaming. Sunlight grew less and less harsh. He could feel a drop of sweat slowly making its way down his side. There was no more piano playing from across the wall. The ashtray, even though just yesterday he told himself he wouldn't let it, contained over a dozen cigarette butts. Deformed, dirty, laying in the pool of ash.

A call was made, 49 minutes later a rather cold pizza came. He ate in silence before throwing out more than half, being disgustingly unedible. Billy Joel played from the neighbor and he found himself tapping his foot on the floor to it. The crack on the wall seemed bigger today, he thought. One more earthquake could do it, he thought. I'd be really fucked then, without the house, he thought. I could stay inside...

A fire brigade rushed past his window, four firetrucks all in all, syrens and everything. He always liked to watch them, or maybe it was just the blue lights, so soothing. An old image appeared in his head, no sound, just visual. Darkness and blue lights, lots of them, surrounding a house, revolving, forever. He made a few steps to the couch and concentrated on the image, helping himself by closing his eyes.

Room seemed darker now, even if there were more pedestrians on the street when he took up his position on the stool, after making a cup of coffee for himself. New people, never before seen. Dogs, owners, married people (he could spot a ring on a finger from mile away, so to say) young girls and old grumpy men. He watched as the shadows grew longer, as the coffee grew colder. Then the couple came. Holding each other, man's arm around woman's waist. They walked slowly, resting their heads against each other's, step by step until they moved out of his area of vision. The sun set behind the buildings on the far west. It was like any other day."

"event","Scared Straight 

Jimmy received a parrot for his birthday.
The parrot was fully grown, with a very bad attitude and worse vocabulary.
Every other word was an expletive; those that weren't expletives were, to say the least, rude.
Jimmy tried to change the bird's attitude by constantly saying polite words, playing soft music... anything he could think of. Nothing worked.
He yelled at the bird, and the bird got worse. He shook the bird, and the bird got madder and more rude.
Finally, in a moment of desperation, Jimmy put the parrot in the freezer.
For a few moments he heard the bird swearing, squawking, kicking and screaming and then, suddenly, there was absolute quiet.
Jimmy was frightened that he might have actually hurt the bird, and quickly opened the freezer door.
The parrot calmly stepped out onto Jimmy's extended arm and said,
""I'm sorry that I offended you with my language and my actions, and I ask your forgiveness.
I will endeavor to correct my behavior"". Jimmy was astounded at the changes in the bird's attitude and was about to ask what had changed him,
when the parrot continued,
""May I ask what the fuck did the Chicken do?"""

"event","WELCOME TO HOLLAND
by
Emily Perl Kingsley.
c1987 by Emily Perl Kingsley. All rights reserved
I am often asked to describe the experience of raising a child with a disability - to try to help people who have not shared that unique experience to understand it, to imagine how it would feel. It's like this......
When you're going to have a baby, it's like planning a fabulous vacation trip - to Italy. You buy a bunch of guide books and make your wonderful plans. The Coliseum. The Michelangelo David. The gondolas in Venice. You may learn some handy phrases in Italian. It's all very exciting.
After months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives. You pack your bags and off you go. Several hours later, the plane lands. The stewardess comes in and says, ""Welcome to Holland.""
""Holland?!?"" you say. ""What do you mean Holland?? I signed up for Italy! I'm supposed to be in Italy. All my life I've dreamed of going to Italy.""
But there's been a change in the flight plan. They've landed in Holland and there you must stay.
The important thing is that they haven't taken you to a horrible, disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine and disease. It's just a different place.
So you must go out and buy new guide books. And you must learn a whole new language. And you will meet a whole new group of people you would never have met.
It's just a different place. It's slower-paced than Italy, less flashy than Italy. But after you've been there for a while and you catch your breath, you look around.... and you begin to notice that Holland has windmills....and Holland has tulips. Holland even has Rembrandts.
But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy... and they're all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And for the rest of your life, you will say ""Yes, that's where I was supposed to go. That's what I had planned."" 
And the pain of that will never, ever, ever, ever go away... because the loss of that dream is a very very significant loss.
But... if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn't get to Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things ... about Holland."

"event","Well, earlier today, i was reading an article about the NAD (national assosication of the deaf) opposing cochlear implants.  One part that really hit a nerve (and there were SEVERAL parts) was... ""people must be proud of their deaf heritage!""  Ok... First issue: im deaf.  Second issue: IM DAMN PROUD OF IT!  

One thing that really pisses me off is people dont try to see how the other half or someone different than them lives, what their lifestyle is like, or rather walk a fucking block in their shoes before opening their mouths. 

 I was born hearing, i come from an all hearing family, i lost my hearing through the course of my childhood life, and the implant was my choice.  Yes, im deaf.  I went to ISD, i graduated with deaf peers, my sign language is pretty fluent, so, i consider myself deaf, with or without my implant.  How dare someone say im not Embracing my deaf culture?!?!  Fuck that!!! 

Im tired and tired and tired and TIRED of people thinking that cochlear implants are attacking the deaf culture.  An implant is an individual choice, and it should be made wisely.  I have thought this over for quite a long time, and TODAY, i am still proud of my decision, just as much as i am proud to to be deaf.  Being deaf is a rare gift. 

I will not tolerate people telling me that i am not deaf, that i have no reason to be around deaf people, that i do not show any pride for my deaf culture because they do not know what the hell they are talking about.  what about those ""deafies"" that wear hearing aids?  ITS THE SAME FUCKING THING, only cochlear implants provide more CLEAR and SELECTIVE hearing/listening.

this shit is getting old and im damn tired of it.  i wish people would grow up and, again, think about the other factors, walk a mile in another persons shoes, and see what their life is like before they open their mouths.

I finally dont have to worry about how im gonna get through college by way of $$... That parts figured out, but the studying part's up to me.  Im in the library right now to do some homework, but i'll get to that right after this. 

School's ok.  Some parts are good, like introduction to education where we do nothing but sit and listen to lectures.  the lectures arent so bad though.  I also like first aid.  I hope i never have to use it though, becuase i know i'll probably screw up.  Intro to psych. is gettin better now that i kinda know what im doing.  We started our group project last week, and everyone know's group projects arent always a good thing, so we will see how this goes. MMM... what else?  oh yeah, English comp isnt so bad either.  we do the normal things you do in high school.  Read novels, write essays, explore the wonderful world of grammer.  and last and definitly LEAST, Child growth and development.  God knows i hate this class... UGH...

Well, better get back to my homework.

A man who tried to shoot seven puppies was shot himself when one of the dogs put its paw on the revolver's trigger.

Jerry Allen Bradford, 37, was charged with felony animal cruelty, the Escambia County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday. He was being treated at a hospital for a gunshot wound to his wrist.

Bradford said he decided to shoot the 3-month-old shepherd-mix dogs in the head because he couldn't find them a home, according to the sheriff's office.

On Monday, Bradford was holding two puppies -- one in his arms and another in his left hand -- when the dog in his hand wiggled and put its paw on the trigger of the .38-caliber revolver. The gun then discharged, the sheriff's report said.

Deputies found three of the puppies in a shallow grave outside Bradford's home, said sheriff's Sgt. Ted Roy.

The other four appeared to be in good health and were taken by Escambia County Animal Control, which planned to make them available for adoption.


ok... now here comes my input.  WHAT THE FUCKING HELL?!?!  What kind of HUMAN would shoot a dog because he couldnt find a home, much less THREE????? gosh this story pisses me off in a lot of ways, and if you could see the picture of them as well, oh wow, i wish i could adopt them all.  look here, to see a pic http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/09/09/shooting.dog.ap/index.html

"event","Wal Mart Urine Test 
One day, in line at the company cafeteria, Jack says to Mike behind him,
""My elbow hurts like 'all get out' I guess I better see a doctor.""
""Listen, you don't have to spend that kind of money,"" Mike replies.
""There's a diagnostic computer down at Wal-Mart. Just give it a urine
sample and the computer will tell you what's wrong and what to do about
it. It takes ten seconds and costs ten dollars...a lot cheaper than a
doctor.""
So Jack deposits a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to Wal-Mart.
He deposits ten dollars, and the computer lights up and asks for the
urine sample.
He pours the sample into the slot and waits. Ten seconds later, the
computer ejects a printout:
""You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water
and avoid heavy activity. It will improve in two weeks.""
That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Jack
began wondering if the computer could be fooled. He mixed some tap
water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and
daughter, and masturbated into the mixture for good measure.
Jack hurries back to Wal-Mart, eager to check the results. He deposits
ten dollars, pours in his concoction, and awaits the results.
The computer prints the following:
1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener.
2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo.
3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab.
4. Your wife is pregnant. Twins. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.
5. If you don't stop playing with yourself, your elbow will never
get better.
Thank you for shopping at Wal-Mart"

its been nearly six months since i;ve been hooked up to my implant, and already i've made a shitload of progress.  WOW... I now understand my name, a few select words, and some short sentences if i try really hard.  Judge Judy is AWFULLY easy to understand, kudos to her!

mmm... My family in Des MOines is pretty fucked up... My mom refuses to either believe me or prove me a liar, so i have not talked to her since march.  AY!  Sarah should be about three months old and i have yet to meet her.  i should feel bad about that, but for some reason, i dont.  I do however MISS the other kids like CRAZY... I hope they are all doing well... I miss them and love them more and more everyday.  :-( Great, now i made myself cry.

I start college this fall.  Im only worried about a couple of things.  
A) paying for everything
B) finding my classes
and 
C) actually PASSING my classes.

i dont know why im concerned about the latter becuase i've always been a good student.  I just have a very bad attention disorder... Yup... im an ADHD child.  Im still considering getting back on my ritalin, only this time i wont have zoloft in the mixture.  I think its bad for the hormones with the BC shot and whatnot.  We'll see though...

Well, thats all for now...

one more thing... i just realized if you cook ham enough to melt cheese in between ham slices, it smells like bacon.  YUM! i dont know why i never noticed that before.  

Im off to spray the gnats.  DIE YOU LITTLE *UCKERS!

"event","Don't worry it's going to be ok.
It's all right little one you're safe and loved.

It's ok to cry, it's ok to be afraid, it's ok to be weak,
it's ok to be vulnerable, it's ok to be human.

It's from all these elements that we grow,
and it's from all these elements that I am born out of you.

I Love You.

You're not alone.
So long as you reach out to others you're never alone.
Ask for my help in loaning you the courage you already have.
It's not that I never give you more than you can handle,
I am not responsible for the consequences of your actions,
only you are.

Stay on the path if you're suffering
by taking the steps you need to take.
Hang on and hang in there, because it's now
that you're growing at light speed,
You're never going backward only forward.

Decay your loneliness, by making full use
of my greatest gift to mankind, which is mankind.
Feel my alleged absence, as proof,
for the paradox that I exist and have always existed.
Let me in by letting me out.

Love fear and all of the other feelings spored
are what create this reality.
These are the cause and effect of compassion and true forgiveness.
Ask for my help in walking through the anguish of forgiveness.
Do everything in your power to learn to forgive
and love those that hurt you,
Not for just them, but for others as well as yourself.
And never give up the hope that some day your ex-suffering
will be able to help the ones who were sick and hurt you,
As well as those who suffered like you.
Learn all this by practising to love everyone.

Always look into yourself first;
you're past, your present, your motives,
you're feelings, and share the secrets
you find with myself as well as others.
Be gentle and kind to yourself
by being vulnerable, and sharing yourself
with others who are patient, kind and who can only
try to love and accept you as much as I do.
As you get better at this,
take the risks that will enable you to venture out
further and further, so that your true self
may finally be exposed to the real world
I created for you to live in.

Be honest with everyone by never
accepting the blame that is not yours.
Free yourself with the truth, by telling
those stepping on your toes how you feel,
no matter how difficult it may seem at first, or
what it's consequences may be
you'll only get better at it.

if you can learn to love/forgive,
fully listen, understand and accept those around you,
you will eventually begin to learn how to love/forgive,
fully listen, understand and accept yourself.

"event","Time is a never ending thing... it slowly steals away our lives... bit by bit.  Before I knew it, it was over a week before I updated my live journal.  And Boystown has yet to call.  MMM... 

Matt and I are taking our lives day by day.  He works the 1-9 shift today, but he feels he'll get off early.  :-)  We both want to catch a movie, but if he doesnt get off at seven, we wont be able to go tonight because i doubt his mom will let him out that late for the 9:00 pm showings.  HRRRUMPH!

I miss my family.  I miss Chris a lot too.  I miss Cora.  I miss Cindy.  I miss Skyler.  I miss Kaile.  I miss Scotta.  I miss Kendra.  :-(  It sucks living two hours away.  But on the BRIGHT side, Cindy says Will will see what he can do on account of moving out closer to me :-D  Susie SO happy at the mere thought of living with her older sister and her new brother.  :-D And Matt.  :-D :-D :-D

Matt and I saw a good movie last weekend- Texas Chainsaw.  Pretty sick at some parts, but overall a great movie.  Because of the lack of captions, I sometimes either fall asleep during some movies or I lose intrest and hide out in the bathrooms buying crap from the vending machines they have in there.  Last weekend, I only left my seat ONCE, to go wee wee.  So overall, i pretty much understood what was happening.  My favorite quote from the movie?  ""what a waste of pig"" LOL!!!

SOOOOOOOOO... oh yeah.. one more thing.  I got my nose peirced on thursday. Its a little bit swollen now but i expect the swelling to go down soon. (i hope.. my nose is already big enough!)

one more thing.  I was watching a commercial the other day and a little boy was dancing and singing, ""i dont want to be your monkey man, i dont want to be your monkey man""... and i just cannot find the lyrics or the NAME of that song!!!.. a little help please?"

"event","I thought it was over baby, we said our good-byes
But I can't go a day without your face, going through my mind
In fact not a single minute, passes without you in it
Your voice, your touch, memories of your love, are with me all the time 


Let me let go, baby...Let me let go
If this is for the best, why are you still in my heart 
Are you still in my soul, let me let go


I talked to you the other day, looks like you made your escape
You put us behind, no matter how I try, I can't do the same


Let me let go, baby...Let me let go
It just isn't right, I been two thousand miles 
Down a dead-end road


Let me let go, darling, want you, I just got to know, yeah
If this is for the best, why are you still in my heart 
Still in my soul, let me let go


The lights of this strange city are shining
But they don't hold no fascination for me
I try to find the bright side baby
But everywhere I look, everywhere I turn, you're all I see


Let me let go, baby...Let me let go
It just isn't right, I been two thousand miles 
Down a dead-end road


Let me let go, darling, want you, I just got to know, yeah
If this is for the best, why are you still in my heart 
Still in my soul, let me let go"

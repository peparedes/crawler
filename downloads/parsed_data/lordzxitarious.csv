"event","Here I sit, a free man, finally gathered most my senses after a draining relationship with a turbocaste. oh well, I am now free to look, to feel, and to be. I can enjoy my home, and my friends. No longer do I have to worry bout the one behind me, who told me constantly how i was going to cheat on her, Cheat? with what energy, I work 2 jobs plus i have to feed her and watch her like a frickin child. gadzuks. Oh well, at least on the plus side i dont have the entire female species pissed off at me about it, thankfully alot of em sided with me.

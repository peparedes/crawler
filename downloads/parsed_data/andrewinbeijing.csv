"event","Ok, I'm still in Beijing, at the GSB Law offices in the beautiful Kerry Mall District.  I have waaaaay to many stories to tell, and way to little time to do it...so this journal is officially done.  Sorry, but it's not worth my time to update this things when I'm so busy doing so much stuff over here.  Don't fret, I wrote up a journal on the computer of all the stuff I've done and observed, and I can share that all with you if you'd like.  However, for all intensive purposes, ANDREWINBEIJING livejournal is no more.  

I'll miss the good times, like when it was earlier in the morning before I was to depart for my flight, and Mariela and I took swings at each other, trying to find out who was the bigger nerd.  I'll also miss....hummm... I'm not sure there was anything else of substance.  Alas, I'm killing this thing riiight abooout noooooowwwww.



...I wonder.........will I dream?"

"event","Ok, leaving the house in about a half hour or so, and then it's to the airport for a long ass plane flight.  More than 12 hours to be a little more precise.  

Frankly, this flight (and the return flight) concerns me most of the whole trip.  It's not that I'm scared of flying, it more or less that I don't want to have to face the reality of my long legs and tall frame being forced to sit in a undersized plane seat for half a day.  I have no idea how I'm going to do it and stay sane.  In fact, I spent all last night building a bomb in my shoe that I plan to detonate and use to put myself out of my misery if I can't take it anymore.

O yes, and I just turned on the tv, only to see that Con Air is on.  It's the scene where the plane full of convicts makes a crash landing.  Awesome."

I know he loves me, but I don't know if he can deal with all the problems I'm having right now. He has this control issue going on, for some reason, and this issue of him not thinking he can trust me. I have been completely faithful to every guy starting with Joe. And that was almost 2 years ago! I've never even thought about cheating on Adam, and I never will. THere is just nobody that can turn me on like him. I know that he wonders sometimes, because of all my 'guy' friends, that I'm cheating on him. I just wish someone could prove him wrong. I've never had the time to cheat on him, even if I had wanted to. Gods, how things get messed up so quickly. I love him with all my heart, and I just wish he'd get thru his hangups so we can start working on mine."

<h3>A BLUE Dragon Lies Beneath!</h3>
</a>
I took the <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/teo592/dragon.html"" target=""new"">Inner Dragon online quiz</a> and found out I am a Blue Dragon on the inside. If there ever was a draconic example of a supple attitude, my Inner Dragon is it. Blues are the Water Elemental dragon - typified by their Steam breath weapon. Pretty creative, huh? It goes right along with my Inner Dragon's tendency to maim, but not destroy. Much like my native oceans and rivers will deform the rock over time, eventually wearing it away to nothing.<br><br>

Humans shouldn't make the mistake of thinking I'm weak, however. After all I'm a good 30 feet in length and have a penchant for materializing out of any body of water, no matter how small. I also enjoy communicating with aquatic lifeforms, hunting in totally inhospitable terrain (i.e. 3000 feet below the waves), and using my fluid nature to my advantage. My enemies probably won't even see me approach in the first place. My favorable attributes are the sunset, Autumn, water, compassion, intuition, and calmness. Naturally, I pity the fool who'd try and prove that calmness part, he'd probly wind up being scalded. *small grin*<br><br>"

I bite my lip to keep it from trembling,

and very slowly fade out over time.
But I can't bring myself to forget about you,

Seeing you is always going to be hard for me,
because I can't stop myself from loving you.
Though, hopefully, I will be able to move on,
while keeping a part of my love for you true.

Songs are constantly being played around me,
and they just remind me so much of you and us.
That I have to close my eyes and silently wait,
so the pain ebbs without much of a fuss.

I will always, <b> always </b>, love you so much,
and remember you without any anger or pain.
Even though the torment from our break-up hasn't ended,
I will be quiet and let time go by frame by frame."

It hurts so much to think that she's getting what should have been mine: His affection. I don't understand why she is so much better than me, but it is so obvious he believes so. It's so hard to sit here and be normal, when all I want is to end everything. I want to leave, move away from this town and just go be someone else for a while. I don't know, and I'm not sure I understand why I want to do this. I think that everything is just getting to hard for me. Too much drama going on, and I don't think I can deal with it. I'm going to talk my mom into getting me on some anti-depressant's. Because that's all I am anymore...depressed. Because I know if I wasn't good enough to keep Chris for longer than a month, what the hell good am I in keeping any guy for long enough, so that they can love me like I do them? It's horrible, and I feel so cheap and dirty. I don't have to really worry about friends, because I have so very few. Hell, maybe then I'd see who my true friends were."

I loved Chris enough for both of us, at least when it came to making love. I wasn't shy with him, and I will NEVER regret anything we did. He showed me that it CAN be enjoyable, when I definatly didn't know that. Oh well, remembering isn't going to bring it back. I have to get over it.

You didn't care how badly you hurt me, just as long as you got out of the situation without your arms tied behind your back. You didn't care that I was dying inside, my heart literally beating so hard and so fast it hurt. The pain was so unbearable, I sobbed the entire ride home from your house. All I could do was curl up on my side, rest my head against the door, and cry. My sister bought me flowers from the store...strange, you never even did that when we dated. My love for you will never die, but I will push it back so far I won't be hurt by you any longer. I know I will cry myself to sleep for so many days coming up...and I will once more go back to the lonely nights. Because you were the first person I've ever slept an entire night with. And that feeling will never quite leave my body. I let you read my inner most thoughts and feelings, gave you my body without the smallest regret...and you still managed to turn yourself against me and cause me the most pain I've ever been dealt. You made plans with me, inviting me with you to your dad's house this summer...to your beach house this summer...all lies. And all tricks that I believe you used to get me into your bed. Well...they worked. You used my complete love for you against me, because I was so weak with you.

Why couldn't you just love me back? Was I so terrible? Did I do everything wrong? Why can't you love me? You loved your ex, maybe that's why you can't love me. Was I a substitute for her? Were you thinking of her when you were making love to me? Did you imagine you were still with her? Was that all I was to you?

I don't understand. I tried everything. I gave you everything, and I still couldn't make you happy. My gods, it seems my luck with relationships isn't improving with age. Merely working harder against me, in destroying my heart. I couldn't please you enough, that you wanted me for longer than a month. You became bored with me, and I was useless. Oh god, that hurts me so badly. I can't stop crying, it's like my tears will never dry. 

I love you so much, so deeply. But I will leave you alone. You want nothing to do with me, so I will simply bury the pain deep inside, cry my heart and soul out at night when no one can hear my sobs into my pillow. And if I run into you on the street, or in a store, or anything...I will smile, turn and walk away. Leave you be. I won't bother you, or stalk you...but I will never stop loving you.

"event","The entire purpose in being in a relationship is comfort and support through the rough and tough times. But I've found out, that most relationships aren't based on that trust or affection.

Because when the going get's rough, the guys get going. And I think this is probably the second relationship I've been in, where I was nothing more than a lonely, lacking substitute for the person they truely wanted.

Lies constantly and harshly told to you, straight to my face...Always telling you how much they love you, only to curl their hands around your heart and squeeze until there's nothing left.

I am absolutely terrified right now, and Chris knew that. He knew I was scared he would leave me...and he lied. He told me he would never leave me. All lies. Constantly telling me he loved me, when it was just shit he was spewing forth from his lips. And he wondered why I argued with him over the fact that he couldn't love me more than I loved him.

My gods, I'm still so completely in love with him, every breath hurts. Each time I see him will make that pain so much deeper. So much stronger. And I know that I was in love with him, so deep...because I absolutely loved Joe, enough to overlook his faults. And <i> <b> HE </b> </i> didn't even hurt me nearly this bad.

I have no clue what I'm going to do. Probably curl my arms around my waist and hold on for dear life. Just be completely scared of the next time I see him...because I know I will just have to turn and walk away, hiding my tears and my pain.

He won't understand, he'll never understand the pain. And I have absolutely no idea what I will do, if my worst fear imaginable comes true.

Gods I never imagined love could hurt you so badly.

My heart is broken so many times....it was so fragile to begin with...

And God damn him he knew that! He held me when I cried over my ex and his bodily use of me. And damn him he has done the same thing.

There won't be another chance for so long, for someone to hurt me. Because I won't be able to love anyone for a long time, the way I love him."

To say I'm still in love, with you,
is a painful lie.
I am in love with an illusion of my own making,
Which was that you were in love with me.
But I see now that you didn't love me,
that my great love affair was one sided.
And I can't figure out which hurts more:
Believing you loved me, or loving a phantom.
A gorgeous illusion you truely were,
and everything I believed I wanted.
But then came the time your visage wavered,
and I saw past your cruel facade.
Admitting I was wrong hurts my pride,
Since I believed the best things of you.
Having you turn against me so quickly,
nearly tore my spirit apart.
Many say that teen-agers do not feel ""true love"",
and I have always fought against that saying.
Because now I know the full extend of the truth:
Teen-age love is often only one sided."

"event","I didn't realize how lonely the nights can be. When you just want to curl your arms around that special someone and hold on as tight as you can. When you want to just close your eyes and curl up close, relaxing within their embrace. The feeling never quite fades, no matter how long it has been.

The nights are the worst, I think. During the day, I have things that can stay on my mind and keep me occupied, but at night...The house is silent except for the ever present christmas music playing softly in the background. And I can't help but try to forget about all the times when I've missed having someone to hold me or to hold. 

I hate being alone. I hate the fact that I don't have 'friends' I can talk to, because everyone has deserted me. I just sit at home and write in my notebooks. Gods, I have so many notebooks full of things that I've wrote. I can't understand why I feel the need to write, but maybe it takes the pain away.

Writing down my emotions always helps..but it never takes away the silence of the night. The chill of the fan's air as it blows over your body even through the blankets. It's the chill that flows to your bone, when you NEED another person's heat to keep you warm. You're just totally alone..at night.

Gods the nights are rough. So you close your eyes and curl you own arms around you (or the nearest extra pillow) and just try to imagine. Just realize that sometime soon, there WILL be someone to curl up with. Someone who WILL love you just as much as you do them. And you beg whatever Higher Being you speak to, to make that come alot sooner. 

I hate the nights...but I love them when I have someone there. It's just been so long since I have had someone...almost 5 months. Longer than that, if you count the facts. But, hopefully, I'll have Chris soon..And I'll feel better....maybe.

"event","Well hello everyone, I'm finally back online again.  The main reason for my long absence has been due to a broken laptop which I only bothered to get fixed a few weeks ago.
So what have I been up to?  Well probably the most exciting thing to report is that I've taken up pole dancing classes.  Always wanting to try different things I found a dance club that does pole dancing classes, so at the beginning of the year I started the beginners course.  I also did an erotic dancing course that included striptease and lapdancing which I enjoyed very much.  Having since completed my first pole dancing course I'm now having private lessons with my teacher at intermediate level.  So far I can do various spins and twists, and I can nearly hang upside down on the pole.  After completing this level I'm going to do the professional level with the intention of working in a club when I'm good enough.  I've got a while to go yet, maybe another 4 months or so of lessons, I'll keep you posted with my progress.

Along with the pole dancing, I'm also doing ballet again...I'm sure you're trying to picture me doing pirouettes and other such things.  I used to do ballet when I was younger and I really enjoyed it, so I'm slowly getting back into it again.  And no, I DON'T WEAR A TUTU!!!

Not much, in fact nothing has happened with my aromatherapy.  After deciding I don't enjoy massage enough to do it as a full time job, I've decided to go back to college and do an NVQ in Beauty Therapy.  The course lasts 2 years and I'm hoping to start in September.  It feels like I'm spending my whole life studying but I've definately decided what I want to do with my life now so this should be the end of it.  The only bugger with this course is that I'll have to take out my labret piercing while I'm at college.  This worries me because the last time I had it done and removed it, it closed up very quickly.  Saying that though, I hadn't had it done that long so I should be ok this time

So that's a brief overview of where I'm at in my life right now.  I'm still doing lots of exercise/dance classes and going to lots of gigs so I'm not around much during the week, therefore, posts will be quite staggered.  But I'll do my best to keep up with everyone.  I hope all you lovely people are doing well and I look forward to catching up on your journals xxx"

"event","I met up with an old friend 2nite who I haven't seen for about 3 years, we had a lot to catch up on so we chatted the evening away.  But....she took me to a townie pub.....OH THE HORROR!  There were lots of girls wearing tiny little skirts and guys in football shirts etc, it's just as well I didn't wear my cannibal corpse t-shirt and new rocks as I had planned.  I also had to sit thorugh karaoke which was painful, never again.
Shit, I've just remembered that it's Sunday evening and I have to go to work tomorrow, I suppose I had better sign off Lj.
In other news, I forgot to set my video to record brookside yesterday, I was not impressed when I got home to find it hadn't recorded.  Oh, and the piggies decided to wake me up at 5am this morning, they decided it would be fun to chase each other around their cages, I wasn't laughing."

Jude provided much entertainment as did everyone who was jumping around on the pogo stick that I bought for Zeke.  When the charcoal eventually arrived we had some nice food and enjoyed the sunshine.  Unfortunately it started raining about 7pm, but we spent all day outside so it wasn't so bad.  Great party guys!"

"event","Ooooooowwwwwwww, I'm in pain!  A word of warning/advice to fellow piercing fans out there.  If you have your nipples pierced with bars and later decide to wear rings, this is a bad idea.  Because the bar is straight and the ring is curved, the constant moving around of the ring causes irritation of the supposedly healed piercing, the result is serious pain.  Fuck, this pain is bad, and driving over the speed bumps tonight was a highly unpleasant experience.  Back to my bars I think.

On a more pisitive note, I got an e-mail from James today, the guy I met at a gig a couple weekends ago.  As I hadn't heard from him since I sent my e-mail, I decided to let that one lie, it seems he has just been busy moving back home.  Anyway, I'm hopefully seeing him on 7th July at another gig which is very exciting.

If anyone is reading this, I'm hoping to go to the Intrepid Fox on thursday, about 7.30pm.  Feel free to come along, the more the merrier.  For more info, drop me an e-mail."

"event","It's far too hot in my house and I'm sitting here eating ice-cream to cool down.  This makes me feel guilty because I should be at my aerobics class, although I did hve good intentions at 6pm when I was attempting to get ready to go. That was until I realised that I hadn't washed my tops so I sat down and watched family affairs instead.

My weekend involved spending a lot more money than I had first intended-mainly on cosmetics as well as a run and a new cage for the piggies.  The 3 girls enjoyed playing together in their run and munching on the grass.  The two babies were placed in a run my sister made for me, but one of them escaped, don't know how.  Luckily my mum noticed and I was able to catch him before he started exploring the garden.  He is a very mischevious character.

So now I sit here unfortunately suffering from hayfever.  Positive thinking has made my body believe that I do not suffer from this extremely inconvenient condition and until now I've had no symptoms.  Damn that evil pollen!"

"event","I will start off saying that none of this is talking shit really.
If you're going to fight with me over what I have to say then obviously you're
not comfortable with the fact that you do this shit any ways.


I went to a close friends house tonight.
Expecting to hang out with friends who enjoyed my company.
But tonight was far beyond that.
Instead I realized how unhealthy and fucked up this city truely is.
And how peoples perceptions on their priorities are extremely fucked up.

It takes certain actions a person preforms to get me to push them out.
Seeing children file in a bathroom to snort cocaine was one of those.
I've never touched cocaine and had the urge to rarely do it. 
I never did though and I'm glad.
Okay I havn't heard a bunch of bad shit about it.
I know people can O.D.
I know it's bad in general.
And I know Lindsay Lohan can't shake the shit.
However, I do know.
That it is rude to do it all up in someones house.
Whether or not you were allowed to or not.
Out of pure respect for yourself and for others.
For yourself in the sense that Someone could have saw you
and word will travel fast in this town.
And for the other people, like me, who quite frankly don't want to be around that.


Maybe I'm over reacting but I was extremely offended and disgusted
with the way that they just sat in there like starving club kids and never came out
but a few times to smoke.

Most of them I knew before all this.
All none of them were like this.
They were healthy lively kids.
And tonight.
All of them looked dead and numb.

I really give up on the hope I once had in people.
Everyone is a fucking dissapointment."

"event","Today has been such a long day.
The baby kitten died around 10:50 am today.
:/

I cried for a while over it and thought about it all day.
As gay as you think it may be crying over a dead kitten, i don't care.
it broke my heart.


Everyday I continue to wonder why I'm still alone.
But I&nbsp; can't do much about it so whatever :[
I need to just lose weight and maybe just maybe by the sheer shallow goodness of the devil
I will end up being uber hot, and then, i'll find someone to love and worship me.
Does that sound conceited and far fetched?

The night had a slight redemption period.
Some good friend time with Kat, Laura, and later, John.

Hookah bar was so-so.
I never liked that atmosphere.
Too many memories and hate being sprawled up there.
But I enjoyed the night anyhow.

I'm still puzzled about my recent guy crush situation.
I don't know what I did wrong but I'm now being exiled.
I wish being an adult caught on to more people.
So we all realized that lying like we're in highschool or middleschool even
about how we "" rlly srsly like someone lol omg wtf ily!"" 

UGH.

Whatever.
Back to my lonely coffin :]

I'm going to go take a bath now, and soak away the bullshit.

"event","Ugh.
Could I feel anymore like shit?

I've been up every two hours for the past 10 hours
Checking on the baby kitten.

The momma cat outside had a litter, but 3 died and only one survived.
I'm now it's mother.
It doesn't seem hard
but it is.
because If I don't check on her every often
She could die or starve or lay in her poop idk something sad :[
So I'd rather lose sleep.


I keep having stupid dreams that I'm with someone.
I know who the someone is but I don't want to state his name.
I just wish things didn't go randomly and unexplainabley&nbsp; sour.
:/
I wish
all those stupid things he said were true
I wish he meant them all
so now I'm back to square one


Lonely.



I'm pretty sure I'm going to go back to sleep now.
Nothing left for me in the day."

"event","I've been nauseated the entire day.
the kind where the smell of food makes me want to puke.
the kind where the site of light or sun burns my pupils.
even this shitty computer monitor screen causes a headache.
it's probably all in my head, or i'm actually sick? i can't tell really.


today has further upset me in one particular problem area of my life.
meh.
i don't see why i'm like not capable of dating someone.
or even like attracting someone.
I apparently having some sort of inner issues.

But really, I've reached that point where I have 100% stopped giving a fuck.
I seriously DON'T CARE.
Why try to achieve some hallmark supported teen angst drama lifestyle 
with some sad individual
who will end up cheating on me any how?
No one is trust worthy, few are exceptional.

Anyone from the male species is tainted.
Even the girls are broken.

Fuck you fake ass bisexual wannabes.
You're not a lesbian, you're bored and underage.
You can't find a suitable male so you flaunt your sexuality in public.
Granted, the hacked reality version of The L word is sometimes entertaining.
As a whole It is very vile and embarrassing .
Some of you are really gay maybe, I don't know.
When you have a float at gay pride day let me know?
Otherwise, keep your myspace fuled lesbian fits on a hold.

I'm sorry, the last girl I dated was a fucking skank and ruined all future girl relationships
or perceptions on girl relationships for me permanently. 


Egh.
Live journal is here for bitching.
If you're bothered don't read this shit, I know I wouldn't.



I need a job.
This mooching off my parents shit is bothering me.
I don't do it on purpose.
Honestly, all I ask for is food and cigarettes.
I'm like a small hamster with a smoking addiction. 
Maybe&nbsp; it's cute?
Throw me in my hamster ball with a pack of camel wides
vitamin water and something concerning pasta and I'm good to go.
Maybe some taco bell?

I want to make something of me 18 1/2 year old cadaverous (and bloated, egh) body.
I think I have potential down here somewhere.

I think one day.
I'll be hot and rich.
Well, I wish.
And then, I'll treat everyone who fucked me over like a piece of shit.
Payback, revenge, karma?
Fuck it.
You're hopefully future screwed :D


This screen is now melting my eye sockets into my skull.

I need to go strip me room of whatever the fuck smells and then spray it or burn it idk.

Eat shit &lt;3"

I keep forgetting my passwords.
That's indeed very lame.

There isn't a need to catch up on my life really.
I'll have oodles of bad days from here on out I'm sure.


But my recent upsetting is yet another human being.
Just don't take things guys say seriously.
They're lying.

I just thought when someone said "" I like you a lot.""
That's exactly what it meant.
Apparently I didn't get the memo?

Fuck ittttttt.

I'm going to my dads house again, I'm sure I'll post a new entry tonight before I sleep.

"event","my internet is bein pretty good to me, so thats cool, i will update now while i have the chance, Tennis sucked today, i punched my racquet,and it started bleeding and my hands got sticky from the blood.  Did you know that you can swallow a pint of your own blood before you get sick? (sorry caitlin) just a lil fun fact. you can also make napalm by mixing equal parts gasoline and diet cola/frozen orange juice concentrate, not A-bombs, Kayla, napalm.  sure, tennis sucked today, but geez jordan, you got ""cheesed off""........gross.i am on pg. 150 of LOTR the fellowship of the ring, and they are just now gettin to the prancing pony, so i only have 250 pgs. left for all the other stuff to happen, that is weird.  anyway.... boobs,sharpee,cup,sword,button,hair,... i dunno. anyway... THESE ARE NOT JUST RAMBLINGS, THESE ARE...POETRY....

my internet/computer is  being so nice that i even got on msn messenger for about 15 seconds, i didn't talk to anybody, but i got on there, so thats a good sign, or a bad one.  

one time, when i was really really little, it was late, everybody was already in bed, it was thundering and lightening outside, and i thought the thunder was dinosaurs, and they were gonna eat me, so i went and slept under my parents bed, no covers or pillows, i didn't wake them up, i don't even think they know about it..........good story. 

i finally got to work out today, i mean actually get a workout, i don't get to very often now.  

congrats forensics team.

i am not goin to school tomorrow, i actaully don't know if i already typed that, i don't feel like goin back and reading, i know i thought of it before, but eh, whatever. i hope you guys miss me, somebody other than my sweetness whom i love soo much.

my love is so strong for laura, that chuck norris couldn't take it,  well he probably could, but not easily. 

time for bed, even though i took a loong nap before.

i love you guys....EXCEPT YOU, GOD I HATE YOU, FUCK YOU....AHHHH.





so how many of you possibly considered that you were that ""YOU"".  cause...don't be crazy, i don't hate you, i don't think.





incase one of you thought that you were ""you"" and then thought i was jokin then thought there really was a ""you"" but i was covering it up with a joke, you are wrong. cause there is no ""you""."

"event","welp here are some lyrics for ya. i am in no way help responsible for their antics

the bloodhound gang: a lapdance is so much better when the stripper is crying

I was lonelier than Kunta Kinte at a Merle Haggard concert 
That night I strolled on into Uncle Limpy's Hump Palace lookin' for love. 
It had been a while. 
In fact, three hundred and sixty-five had come and went 
since that midnight run haulin' hog to Shakey Town on I-10. 
I had picked up this hitchhiker that was sweatin' gallons 
through a pair of Daisy Duke cut-offs and one of those Fruit Of The Loom tank-tops. 
Well, that night I lost myself to ruby red lips, 
milky white skin and baby blue eyes. 
Name was Russell.

Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Well I find it's quite a thrill
When she grinds me against her will
Yes a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'

Well, faster than you can say, ""shallow grave"", 
this pretty little thing come up to me and starts kneadin' my balls 
like hard-boiled eggs in a tube sock.
Said her name was Bambi and I said, ""Well that's a coincidence darlin', 
'cause I was just thinkin' about skinnin' you like a deer."" 
Well she smiled, had about as much teeth as a Jack-O-Lantern, 
and I went on to tell her how I would wear her face like a mask 
as I do my little kooky dance. 
And then she told me to shush. 
I guess she could sense my desperation. 
'Course, it's hard to hide a hard-on when you're dressed like Minnie Pearl.

Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Well I find it's quite a thrill
When she grinds me against her will
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'

So, Bambi's goin' on about how she can make all my fantasies come true. 
So I says, ""Even this one I have where Jesus Christ 
is jackhammering Mickey Mouse in the doo-doo hole 
with a lawn dart as Garth Brooks gives birth to something 
resembling a cheddar cheese log with almonds on Santa Claus's tummy-tum?"" 
Well, ten beers, twenty minutes and thirty dollars later 
I'm parkin' the beef bus in tuna town if you know what I mean. 
Got to nail her back at her trailer. 
Heh. That rhymes. 
I have to admit it was even more of a turn-on 
when I found out she was doin' me to buy baby formula.

Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Well I find it's quite a thrill
When she grinds me against her will
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'

Day or so had passed when I popped the clutch, 
gave the tranny a spin and slid on into 
The Stinky Pinky Gulp N' Guzzle Big Rig Snooze-A-Stop. 
There I was browsin' through the latest issue of ""Throb"", 
when I saw Bambi starin' at me from the back of a milk carton. 
Well, my heart just dropped. 
So, I decided to do what any good Christian would. 
You can not imagine how difficult it is to hold a half gallon of moo juice 
and polish the one-eyed gopher when your doin' seventy-five 
in an eighteen-wheeler. 
I never thought missing children could be so sexy. 
Did I say that out loud?

Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Well I find it's quite a thrill
When she grinds me against her will
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'

I have to write a page (as punishment) about Chuck Norris. thats awesome, my previous punishment was a story about bellybuttons.

i had an awesome day of gluttony and tennis with my sweetness. we ate at huddle house and at eachothers food, there was some lil girl in the booth in front of us, that was turned all the way around, staring at us. laura and i were sitting beside eachother, so our coats were in the seat opposite us, she proceeded to stab them with her fork. lol. but it was more entertaining for us.  then we played tenns for almsot two hours. i love tennis.

"event","Today was awesome. i played tennis with Laura, then we went to the boys jv game, after that laura and I went with Adam and his girlfriend and had some dinner, that was pretty awesome. then laura and i actually played tennis again. it was cold, but very fun. this was stretched over hours so it was fun as hell. good times.

I hope i can always play as well as i did today all the time. cause if i do then i will be in great shape.  Did you know that licking doorknobs is illegal on some planets? cause it is.  i love pizza.  I hope my value drawing in art turns out well, it feels good to be finished with my space ghost painting.  it's pretty damn good.  i slacked of a lil on the finer details, but i wanted to be finished.  I don't have a lot of cool things to talk about. i doubt anyone cares about my sweetness, tennis, or art.  So i will try and think of something interesting, if you have tuned in this long....not like you can actually tune in to anything on here....but if you could, you may not have this long. whoah, ""this"" and ""long"" are right on top of eachother....or are they below eachother, or is it one another?....one anohter, def.

as i draw to a close (how the hell does one draw to a close, i take art and everything, but i can't draw a close, well i suppose i could try. but it would be strange.

You are strong and powerful. Crossing you is not a good idea.
You have worked hard to get to your position, and you're not about to give it up to anyone.

Your fortune:

In the near future, you need to be willing and able to defend those you love.

Only i can prevent forestfires, so you guys better not piss me off, cause i have the power to destroy you all.  commercials are getting retarded, do they even try anymore?

  I have nothing to say and yet i continue to type, which has nothing to do with what i say, which i have nothing to say...but i shall type on, i shall trudge through the typers block...if it exists, which i declare it's existence. so now that it exists, i shall trudge through it.

  if i ever write a book then it will be 987 pp. of this...just rambling and contradictions, but you will read it damn you, yes, you will read it. well you won't but you should, cause it will be great. maybe i should write a book about the 7654 words that sound funny, their meaning, and why they sound funny. I have a lot of books to read, but most people do. i should read the stalker book;) i feel stupid when i type these updates. i am going to bed early tonight.  somebody once called me apathetic, but i don't care. <-that one was all me. but it has prolly been said like a billion times before.  plagiarism is scary cause what if you say one broad casual sentence that is exactly like someone else's and you are totally screwed over and kicked outta college. that wouldn't not be not cool.

  i apologize for not spacing this update into multiple paragraphs.  so i think i will...and you would not have known that it wasn't in multiple paragraphs if i hadn't said anything, but i totally did, wasting about a minute of your time.  if i did write a book i promise you won't not be not hating it.  welp, this is it you guys.  is there anything you guys wanna tell me? cause you can."

Is Japan open on sundays?  who would win between a shark and a bear in zero gravity? i would root for the bear. i should celebrate wednsday, but i don't.  i havn't been reading enough either.

  anyway,  i wish i could get a tatoo of a lil violin on my thumb and a lil bow on my index finger so i could play the worlds smallest violin, but then i would want to use it all the time cause its a frickin tatoo, so i want to get all the use i can out of it, then people will think i am a total dick cause i keep playin the worlds smallest violin and they will mock me, and say ""hey, who am i?"" and they will mockingly play the world's smallest violin.  so i am not goin to do that,....good story. what a rediculous claim anyway, has anyone seen all the violins in the world? thats what i thought.  I can't wait til the ATHF movie. Remove the chain, cause that is of it.lol.  i am a lazy bastard. except i did run 1.2 miles with lincoln for no reason at all except boredom, that is the only exercise i have gotten in awhile.  we played basketball, we were so bad, it took us almost 45 minutes to play around the world, NBA here we come, good joke.  maybe i should start painting outside of art class.

fuzzles are pretty neat little creatures. i wish i had one.  all anyone wants is some recognition or appreciation.  well not all, or anyone....once again i am contradicting myself.  my sleeping habits are gettin worse.  i have just noticed that i have more visible veins in my left hand. here is some poetry for you.

       they paint these stalls to hide my pen
       the shithouse poet strikes again

i don't know about you guys but i think that this has to do with the poets stance on the study of octadecene and it's effects on the viscosity of quantum dots, but that is just my opinion.  i forgot where i saw that...it was probably some collection of poem or somethin...i do remember somethin else...it said for a good BJ call 583-1519....so like any other person would do, i called and someone picked up they sounded like a real old lady, she said "" hello, we got the best BJ in town, bar none."" so i asked, ""is that black berry or blue berry"" and dey says "" boisen berry, all the  other berries are outta season"" and i says "" nah, boisenberry gives me da hives"".......good poem.  one day there will be a massive war between the hotdogs and cats...they will meet eachother on the field of battle, the hotdogs shooting lazers out of their newly developed eyes while the cats use their lazer cross bows (not to be confused with the bowcaster used by wookies)

i can't think of all those awesome things to talk about like i used to, well not as much as i used to. i guess i don't enjoy it as much or think that it is entertaining."

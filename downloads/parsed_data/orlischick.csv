My parents leave for a week on the 12th so I get to stay home all alone. It'll be a blast.  I'll finally have some peace and quiet without the girls screaming at each other.
jen- if you read this.. I'm sorry I disn't get back to youthat day. We went to cell one forever and we couldn't even get my phone activated then so we went to amanda's. i didn't come back into town til like 11:00. sorry!
school starts pretty soon. it's  kinda weird that I'll be graduating this year.  Then i have to move for four years, for college, of course.  That's all my life will be is schooling. I don't know. maybe i should skip a year then go to college. i have no idea what i want to do.  
There are a bunch of people from out of town up because of a wedding.  They don't leave for like 4 more days either so it'll be fun hanging out with different people for once.
well, i have nothing else to say. update later!"

So now I have a 2000 Green, Ford Taurus, which puts me, oh lets see.... $6000 in the hole! So uncool, plus now I have a bill at Fine Line for the work they did on it, 'cuz my dad got the price lowered and bought it as is.  But oh well, it'll only take me say.. two years to pay it off! 
Well, I broke up with my b/f yesterday, cuz he was like soooo serious, planning on moving with me when I went to college and he got all pissed and started cursing and acting very immature, when he is 23.  So yeah, I dumped him, prolly broke his heart but seeing as I am 16 years old, I don't need a serious relationship right now.  I'm too young, or at least that is what I think.
Well, I am at school and seventh hour is getting over soon and then I get to go to work(BORING!)... hahaha. Update l8ter!"

So, after Rhonda came home she called them and asked them why they didn't coem in.. so they came back-just to stay for about 10 minutes.  Cole and Les stayed until the other guys came back and then they went to go play hockey.  Well, Les left his car sideways int he driveway so we had Rhonda's friends move it and then we filled it with snow! It was so funny! But then, when we were leaving, we decided to take most of the snow out.  So, when we were doing that, a neighbor lady came outside and started hollering at us saying we were vandalizing his car and blah blah blah.  We told her it was none of her business what we did with his car and then we left.  But les didn't even care- he just got Rhonda back by putting a huge thing of snow on her living room floor! It was so funny.

and i got into a rollover last thursday. it was me, meghan t from calumet and nadine ruonavaara. i dont know how it happened but all of a sudden we were sweerving and the next thing i knew, we were in a ditch. i flew out of the jeep and landed on the topper of it cuz i guess it came off when we rolled. but i was lying in a bunch of glass so i had cuts all over my back and had to get stiches in my neck.  meghan had to get 70 stitches in her mouth cuz she got a cut that went right thru her lip.  and nadine, the driverm was fine. so that was great.

We decided to eat at Burger King in Calumet and then we had to go through a car wash because her car was pretty gross... Anyways, we then went to MTU to look at the snow statues...which were cool.  But we froze to death and went to the campus store. I bought her a lightbulb that had many diff. colors in it and a yooper bar.  We went to look at more statues and the best of all was hte McDonalds' one buy TKE.  It was awesome! But after that we froze all the way back to her car and went to her house...to clean. But then I watched 2Fast 2Furious and i didnt get to finish it so i got mad.  I got back home around 6 to find that my laundry room had been ripped apart... we are getting  new shower downstairs! Yay!
Anyways, I had a pretty fun weekend, b/c I never get to spend time with my sister...so it was awesome!"

Well, I caught the ball and that person was out but Nathan kept running. So I took the ball and whipped it at him.  When it hit him, he fell over and rolled a little bit.  It was so freakin' funny! I overheard people saying that he had a big welt wherever I hit him! The whole class was lauhging.....
Anyways, I didn't do anything yesterday.  I waited for Kath to get home so we could do our Euro. History and we didn't do it until 9:45.  We got done and hour later... 10:45 and I didnt get too much sleep  and didn't get all of my gym stuff so i was pretty crabby after gym....

Well, we watched Pirates of the Carribean (or however you spell it) and then we ate dinner.  Then me and Nadine got real bored and we wanted to go for  drive. Not go anywhere 'cuz nothing is open on Christmas day but just go for a drive.  He started bitching that I was too young and I couldn't go anywhere with Nadine.  So i got really pissed off and yelled at him in front of everyone and i told him to fuck off and I walked out the door. My uncle came after me b/c I was swearing my head off and told me to go for the drive, cool down and come back later.  Nadine and I left and went to Amanda's house.  I went home around 9:00 and he bitched at me for five minutes and made me clean the kithcen and said I was going to pay for yelling at him in front of everybody and for leaving. I was like who gives a fuck? I dont! So i just went to my room and listened to music and lit my candles.
Anyways, I am at Kathleens house right now and I have to feed Daisy until Kelly gets back, which I think will be soon.  SHe is coming back earlier then her mom and dad and kerry, dane, and kath might come back with her.  (to leave their parents some time to themsleves).
Well, I guess I got all my anger out talking about my dad.  I will talk to you all later.

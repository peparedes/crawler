"event","Easter was off da hizzle.

I went to church today!!!! I go twice a year, christmas and easter. It was exciting. I'll have to go back sometime.


- After church I went and caused an uproar at my grandmas during dinner.

+ After dinner I Went to wal-mart with my mom and bought 100 dollars worth of junk food by sneaking things into the buggie while she wasn't looking. Much to her dismay. 

+ After wally world Dan and I went to see walking tall. It was funny. Plus the Rock is so sexy ya know.  Then we went to mcdonalds cause it was the only place that was open on Easter. That makes 5 out of the 7 days this week i have had fast food for dinner. I'm on pace to die next year.

-I blew all of my paycheck this weekend already. That's very depressing. Whatevvvv.

-We have school tomorrow

+ I don't think im going.

+ I have finally gotten a band going.

-Weird Al's parents died.



Well thats my update. I love you guys."

Now i'm just waiting to go to work. 5-11:30. Woopee. Last night Ashley came over and we went to giant eagle and bought popcicles! Popcicles rule hardcore. And fruity pebbles, and cheeeese ballllsss, and gatorade. Everything we were in the mood for. And we had a little party by ourselves. It was nice. Very nice. 

     I was looking foward to cici's pizza with brian ben and michelle. But since i'm so nice, i told some girl id work for her. But since she's so nice she wont work for me tomorrow. Being nice to people gets you nowhere. Seriously. It just makes people take advantage of you..."

"event","Hey, this weekend was cool.

     Friday Dan H, Dan L, Greg and myself went to cici's all you can eat pizza buffet. Then we went to k-mart and tried to buy a bb gun to shoot cows with, but no such luck. So we went to gregs house and watched the pitt game while conversing about different things. I found myself growing bored, so i went to Brians house. We played x-box for awhile, finished watching the pitt game.

   Saturday I asked brian if he would go see grease with me, since I had a major obligation to go. He reluctantly agreed. It was ok. Musicals never hold my attention, so Brian and I played an hour long game of rock paper scissors, followed by thumb wrestling, followed by cell phone games. No offense to anyone who was in the musical. Those sort of things dont hold my interest. Accept the wizard of oz last year was very good. I think the major problem with this years musical was they did a horrible job picking the cast. Nobody played their role very well. Ashley did very very very very good though. I was very proud of her. And so did lynds! Im very sorry i didn't dance on the stage with you lynds. I was just very comfy in my seat. I regret not doing it now. Jackie did very good too. But when you guys were not on the stage, I was zZzZzZzZ.

     Last night at work ruled. It was sooo slow. Steph and I called papa johns and told them if they brought us pizza we would give them ice cream. So basically we just pigged out on pizza and ice cream. It was like a birthday party.


   This week sucks ass. More PSSA's. BLAAHH.

So anyway, it's been pssa's and work. Work has been very intersting to say the least. One of my managers likes to sneak her friends into the walk-in freezer and get high. Seriously, if you can't even wait until you get home to get high, then you're a really big loser. 

    Although my week has struggled, my weekend has ruled. I spent the night with my sweetheart. We went and saw ""The passon of the Christ"". It was a good movie, but i didn't like it. It was very sad, and the whole point of it was to make you feel extremely guilty. It was very well directed. But no. It wasnt a movie i would ever watch again. I just really wanted to see what all the hype was about. I believe in God and everything, i just don't like religious movies.

    Today I worked. Tonight I had one of the funniest nights I have had in a long time. I hung out with Brian, Frank and Ryan. And we went out to dinner. Then we commited a Federal Offense and I hope we don't get put in jail. Though it was the funniest crime ever commited. I'd rather not mention it though. After that we went back to Brians house and played RISK!!!!! Hahahaa, very fun night.

     I'm worn out. It is bed time. I love you everybody <3."

"event","Work sucked last night. It was super busy. I can't stand the public as a whole. People are so bitchy. I know im contridicting myself when I say this, because I am guilty in many aspects of this public stereotype as well. The difference between Bruster's and fast food restaurants, is that everything gets sent back. You do one thing wrong, it gets sent back. If one milk shake is too milky, it gets sent back. Not enough hot fudge? Damn that bitch is coming back. I find it horribly irritating. Usually at fast food restaurants, a lot of times people will just grunt and deal with it. I think part of the reason is that I work in Bethel Park, and many people in Bethel Park are snobs. It just amazes me how someone can so grumpy over their ice cream cone being messy! I mean its ice cream! How isn't ice cream messy? Everyone is so picky. It's  annoying, but it's not going to stop me from lovin that job. That job rules."

Today consisted of being boredddddd. I played the sims a lot today. I made a real world house with all my friends. Then I took like 50 pillion pics with my digi cam, which ill post eventually.  

I'm out fo now."

"event","To put it mildly, today was a not so good day. Everything would be perfect right now, if I could just somehow muster up a way to stop the constant conflict with my parents. But I'm really coming to the conclusion, that no matter how much I get blamed for, and no matter how much they say I do wrong, nothing they say is true. I mean, after we fight, I will try so hard to think of what I did wrong, but there is nothing. I understand a lot of people feel this way about their parents, but damn, I would bet my life that I'm right. It's pretty horrible. 

    After my day started off with a fight with my mother, Brian and I went to pizza hut for the pizza hut buffet, which was yummy.

    Then I had my first day at work. It's pretty cool. It's a lot of fun, just a bit challenging. They make over 500 different types of ice cream, but they only serve 24 at a time. Which is really cool, but honestly i'm not a huge ice cream fan. I love sherbert. And i like a few flavors, but i'm not a big fan of it. The job seems pretty easy though, the people there are pretty nice.

    I'm so worn out, both physically and mentally, and it's taking its toll. I hate having to be dependent on my parents. I hate the thought. They shove every little thing they do for me down my throat. But you know, it was they who accidently brought me into this cruel nasty world, so as far as i'm concerned, they fucking owe me a lot. That might not be a good attitude, but it's the truth.

                Goodnight"

I didnt skip, cause i'm not a senior. But the rest of the school did...

I start work tomorrow. I'd normally be nervous, but the people that work there are idiots, so its ok if i act like an idiot, cause i'd fit right in. Before I go, Brian and i are heading to the all you can eat pizza buffet at pizza hut, which is a HORRIBLE idea, due to the fact that I have to go to work straight from there.

Then our dinner consisted of the dollar menu at wendys. We are the fast food kings. It's not unlike us to hit up 2 or 3 fast food restaurants in one day. Very unhealthy though. After that Mike came over for an hour or two to get a brief beating in madden. Then I was exhausted so i took a nap. During my nap Jesse called and I went to his house for a few hours.

"event","I felt much better today. Well I did until a half hour after I woke up. Before I tell you this story, i have to start with another one:

     I no longer have a good relationship with my dad. I mean, I would love too, and I try all the time too, but its useless. We had a good relationship up until 2 years ago, and then for some reason it just went down hill. The only time my dad speaks to me is when he says ""GEEETTT AAA JOOOBBB"". Now that you know this information I will begin my story

     So today I woke up. Called my baby, and my call waiting beeped. What do you know, ITS BRUSTERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They called and asked me to come in  for an interview. I went downstairs and told my dad I needed his car to go for an interview. I was so excited, cause I thought my dad would like me if i had a job. Boy was I mistaken. He flipped out on me, because Brusters is 15 minutes away. Which makes no sense, because the other places I applied at are like 20 minutes away, and he oked those. Anyway, I flipped out on me, screamed, yelled and what not, because it was 15 minutes away. Jesus. He doesnt want me wasting his gas. There is seriously no pleasing him. I really can't take it. So I go for the interview and I get the job. YAAAY. I start Friday. I got my bruster's shirt, and I got my bruster's hat. it's gonna be cool. I'm the only guy that works there, it's all girlies. It seems pretty cool. I only work 3 days a week. Anyway, I come home, and I ask my mom if i can go to the library. Here was our convo

Me: Mom can I go to the library?
Mom: No. You will probably go somewhere else. You dont even like to read.
Me: Yes I Do! Where else would i go?
Mom: I dunno. You might go do drugs. You just know i'll say yes if you go to the library. I bet your going to go do drugs, so no.
Me: I HAVE NEVER DONE DRUGS!?

So cool man. Now im accused of doing things I have never even done. We got in a huge fight, and now i'm not allowed to drive her car, but I have to pay 70 dollars a month for my car insurance. Hmmm something doesnt seem right. I pay 70 dollars a month, and i'm not even allowed to drive the god damn car. WOOOO. I love life. My mom is pyscho. She seriously needs help. My dads a jerk. I don't know how I am supposed to operate with parents who are half retarded...

     Well anyway, after that, Mike came over and we filmed cribs. After we filmed cribs, we played ps2 and ate 3 boxes of gushers.

Tonight my baby is coming over tonight to calm me down from the psychoness my parents thrust upon me."

I got 12 hours of sleep last night which ruled, and I probably added another 3-4 on to that total today. Ashley and I were supposed to have a slumber party tonight, but her Great Grandmother passed away and I haven't heard from her since after school yesterday. I don't know how she is, or where she is. All I know is that she is not home and I miss her :(. Tonight I watched Gone in 60 seconds, followed by edward scissor hands, followed by the lion king. BLaaaaaH. I love the lion king though. That movie's a classic.

     Last night Brian and I went to see Miracle, but it was sold out. So we got some unique food at the mall, and of course i stocked up on gummy bears!!!!! Then I went back to his house and we played x-box, and made fun of michelle. Heh.

Tomorrow Mike's coming over and were filming cribs at my house for video production. AHAHHAAHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

Today was downright thrilling. I decided to go out with Dan and Greg. We got 15 arbys sandwiches for 15 bucs!!! Also put in an application there.

On the way back dan crashed the car. We slid on some ice right into a sign that said ""Weight Limit 10 tons"". WOOOOO. Knocked it right off its ass. This put a big dent in the front of Dan's car, and caused his oil to leak. We got to gregs house and greg put some oil in it. Then we got back to dans house and the car stalled in his 1294319932 mile drive way, and it doesnt start anymore. RIP Beaver. Everyone was ookk. Some old fella stopped and helped us out.

I came home, did some arguing, since thats all we ever do anymore.

""It's hardly snowing!"" I replied
""YES IT IS! I WAS JUST OUT THERE."" Shot back my father
I sighed.
""DONT BLAME ME FOR THE WEATHER"" He harshly added.


See...I've had this problem with my parents, and this phase they are going through. I like to call it the ""fibbing/exaggerating phase"". This phase only pops up when I want to use the car. My dad loves to use weather as an excuse why I can't use the car. He will call me from work and say ""Dont think your going anywhere, where supposed to get a huge snow storm tonight."" Meanwhile I watch the weather and all they are calling for is flueries. I have literally asked my dad to go somewhere before, and he has told me no, and I have asked why, and he has said ""Because its too cold"". I just don't know how I am supposed to deal with such ridiculous childish behavior. I sent a very detailed e-mail to Dr. Phil asking him if he would have my parents and I on his show to help fix this problem of theirs."

New Years was quite a trip. Ashley and I went to Brian's party, which was fun, but nothing out of the ordinary. I was really hoping for alcohol, but there was a very limited amount. We just played air hockey and beat the shit out of each other like we always do. We left around 12:30, and went back to my house. Ashley stayed over...We didn't really sleep. We stayed up all night talking. We layed in my room together and just talked. We would go from laughing and being happy, to crying and being sad. It was a very starry-eyed night, as we just laid their with the only light being that of my neon guitar light. I found out things about her that I never knew before, and i've dated her for a year and 10 or 11 months. I loved last night. I really loved it. But after we have a great night like last night, I find myself missing her like hell. I want to talk to her and be with her every second of the day. We are 16, and I shouldn't feel like that at 16 years old. I shouldnt constantly feel the need to be with her, and that's what makes it so scary and confusing. So I try to seperate myself from her, by exposing my mind to all the bad thoughts, and bad situations that have happened between us. Which also leaves me miserable. It's nights like these that leave me utterly confused. The majority of my journal entrys are of this kind, but it's the major thing going on in my life right now."

Everything has been pretty consistant latley

Christmas was great. I got a cellular device, sine I was the only kid in the United States who didn't have one. My new number is 724-986-9188 for anyone who cares to call me:) My parents also got me an awesome new cd player, some clothes, a watch and other things. My sister got me the Foo Fighters dvd, which I love. My grandma got me a radio I can take in the shwa. It was good.

Friday night, I agreed to meet Ashley at the mall. We went shopping, and out to dinner. It was nice. She came home with me, and she slept over. Which was really really nice. But I have a really hard time getting too close with her again. It's kind of like...one big mind game. Which isn't really nice.  Last night I went to the Pens game with my dad. Its nice to do something with my dad once in awhile.


I really despise this time of the year. Right after Christmas sucks. I really don't like January-March. It's just cold and miserable. New YEars is my least favorite holiday. I don't like it at all. 


Over Christmas I was talking to my cousins husband. He travels around the world with kids from his church, and he asked me if I was interested in going to Nicaragua for 2 weeks this summer. That would be so raza. Accept its sort of a mission thing. I mean I believe in God and everything, but i'm not all about offering food for exchange in belief of a religion. Anyway, Nicaragua is a very dangerous country. But I really could give a shit less. So is America."

"event","It is finally Christmas break.

On Saturday Night, Dan called and we decided to go to the movies, and he drove. We decided to see Stuck on you, since LOTR would be way to packed. Plus...believe it or not, I haven't seen the first two LOTR movies. I'd like to see those before I sit in the movie theater for 3 and a half hours watching the third one. Stuck on you was the lamest movie ever. Holy fuckin begeebers, the people making out in the seats infront of us was a better show then the movie. It was a fun night though. The window in the car broke and we had to ride the whole way there and the whole way back with the window down, which made things a bit nippy. It was hella fun though.

Yesterday on the other hand was of the less enjoyable days I've had in a long time. Primarily because I remain confused as hell about my relationship life. Yes, I basically say the same thing ever fucking entry. Ashley and I battled long into the night last night. No fun. Lots of crying. Lots of hurtful words. No fun. Somethings gotta give sooner or later."

"event","Last night, Brian and I did our Christmas shopping as planned. Kayla, Naioco, and I were supposed to go look at Christmas lights, but I was waaay to sick. I took some medicine, and felt ok enough to go Christmas shopping though. Plus that was something I had to get done. It wasn't bad. We got it all done pretty quick. Though While I was looking for Ashley's present, I ran into her there. I knew she was going to the mall too, I guess I just forgot. It startled me to see her... Afterwards I went back to Brians, and we hung out in the basement, which made my allergies go haywire, since they have been so bad latley. So I went home.

Nothing is planned for today, but I hope to plan something. I woke up feeling shitty again, but I took some more medicine. I took a shower. I guess staying home and relaxing wouldn't hurt, but I would rather do something. Sitting at home only causes worrying. Staying busy is good.

I don't know how things are going to work out with this whole thing, but it leaves me very confused. I don't want to fight around Christmas, I just would like to be happy, so thats what i'm doing. Atleast until after the holidays."

Tonight I'm going to pick Brian up from swimming, and then were going to do some Christmas shopping. He is getting Sammy a build a bear, haha. I'm still trying to finish off Ashley's present. We both agreed that we would not spend more then 50 this year. I still need to get something for Kayla, my dad, and my sister...

I have had this continuing dream over the last few years. I don't know if anyone else has continuing dreams. I'll dream it every now and then, and I drempt it last night. I dream that I'm at kennywood having a good time, and the steal phantom is stuck. But it's the old steal phantom with the loops. So then one of the cars fall off, and a women grabs on the track and hangs there for her life. It's really weird. But anywho, it usually puts me in a pretty lousy mood. It's a really sad dream.


But I must say, this Biggest news of the week is that....

"event","<p>I'm in Vermont right now :) I have a lot of downtime seeing as how chris is at work the whole day. I got breakfast this morning then came back to bed until the maid got here to clean at which point I went to the pool. I read all afternoon, poolside. If was relaxing. I love vermonts scenary. Last night when we were driving home from longhorne, it reminded me of mansfield and the final stretch on 15. That really got me thinking about summer. Every year I can remember being so excited to go back. Don't get me wrong, I am looking forward to it. But there's just stuff I will miss. Miss work, my bests, sleeping in, and relying on hotels to have continental breakfasts. And of course,  the boy is holding me back too. Yeahhh I'm focusing on chris. Dan might be right for me on some levels but I can't get past the herpes - without sounding slutty it totally turns me off. I made an extensive pros and cons list and Chris wins</p><p>La la la la tonight we are going to tour ben & jerrys! I'm excited :)</p><p><em><small>Posted via <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/cosysoftware_en/"">LiveJournal.app</a>.</small></em></p>"

"event","i pulled something in my neck while sleeping last night. initially i thought it was just me being goofy and sleeping in an odd position, but when i couldn't lift my head up after 20 minutes, i got kind of scared. i finally suffered through the pain and sat up. i couldn't brush my hair, let alone straighten it. and when i went to put it in a ponytail i was near tears. i took a few ibuprofen, but i'm still in pain like 4 hours later. it hurts soo bad :(&nbsp;:( time to take another pill and get some lunch! for sure.


i got me&nbsp;&amp; dustin's laundry out of the dryer and decided to fucking iron all of it. haha even his underwear :p but it was fun. then i cleaned out the fridge because we had spilled a few jello shots in there over the last two weeks. i have to do dishes after lunch, go to class, go to office hours to record the news and a promo, and then go to a meeting regarding a naughty radio kid. blah blah blah. 

today will be long but i'm looking forward to my committee meeting :)"

"event","i'm sorry if i stretched your friends page. i'm tired of being mistreated and always seen as the bad guy. i'm just glad i have&nbsp;&quot;proof&quot; that i'm not always a bad person. of course i'm going to be defensive when someone says things like that, but you learn a person's true colors. you look past the lies they've made for themselves and you realize it's time to move on. with that being said, i am much happier.

besides that, i had a great day today. i moved all my shit out&nbsp;of my room and my roommate helped me do so. she asked me why my room smelled so bad and i told her i didn't know because i didn't live in there, only showered and got dressed - then left. but once we got over to my new room, stephen, matt, roxy &amp; danger came over while dustin was at the gym. i met some of the girls on my floor - super nice! mega friendly. i love it. i can't wait til dustin moves onto b-side. but like, i'm glad i can chill over there and not feel like an intruder. she fits in soo well. i can't wait to get her involved with radio! hahahah. like stephen put a trashcan in front of our door and knocked. i opened it and wamm!&nbsp;all over. she thought it was hysterical so at least she wasn't pissed like &quot;clean it up&quot; blah blah. 

tomorrow i have class at 230 and some radio meetings. my 4450 meeting today was super productive! good timess! 

i'm in a great mood. no stress."

"event","so... i was nearly shocked when i saw john mccain decided to pick a woman as his vice president. then i read this information, and i hope this &quot;dead even&quot; poll standings shift dramatically toward obama now. i'm frightened to see what would become of the united states if mccain and palin got in office.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""INFO!""><p><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">Yesterday was John McCain's 72nd birthday. If elected, he'd be  the oldest president ever inaugurated. And after months of slamming Barack  Obama for &quot;inexperience,&quot; here's who John McCain has chosen to be one heartbeat  away from the presidency: a right-wing religious conservative with no foreign  policy experience, who until recently was mayor of a town of 9,000 people.</font></p>  <p><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">Huh?</font></p>  <p><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">Who is Sarah Palin? Here's some basic background: <br /></font></p>   <ul><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif""><ul><li>She was elected Alaska's governor a little over a year and a half ago. Her previous office was mayor of Wasilla, a small town outside Anchorage. She has no foreign policy experience.<sup>1</sup> </li><li>Palin is strongly anti-choice, opposing abortion even in the case of rape or incest.<sup>2</sup> </li><li>She supported right-wing extremist Pat Buchanan for president  in 2000. <sup>3</sup> </li><li>Palin thinks creationism should be taught in public schools.<sup>4</sup> </li><li>She's doesn't think humans are the cause of climate change.<sup>5</sup> </li><li>She's solidly in line with John McCain's &quot;Big Oil first&quot; energy policy. She's pushed hard for more oil drilling and says renewables won't be ready for years. She also sued the Bush administration for listing polar bears as an endangered species&mdash;she was worried it would interfere with more oil drilling in Alaska.<sup>6</sup></li><li>How closely did John McCain vet this choice? He met Sarah Palin once at a meeting. They spoke a second time, last Sunday, when he called her about being vice-president. Then he offered her the position.<sup>7</sup></li></ul>              </font></ul> <p><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">This is information the American people need to see. Please take a  moment to forward this email to your friends and family.</font></p>  <p><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">We also asked Alaska MoveOn members what the rest of us  should know about their governor. The response was striking. Here's a sample:</font></p>  <p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""> <font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">She is really just a mayor from a small town outside Anchorage who has been a  governor for only 1.5 years, and has ZERO national and international  experience. I shudder to think that she could be the person taking that 3AM  call on the White House hotline, and the one who could potentially be charged  with leading the US  in the volatile international scene that exists today. </font></span><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">&mdash;Rose M., Fairbanks, AK</font></p>  <p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""> <font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">She is VERY, VERY conservative, and far from perfect. She's  a hunter and fisherwoman, but votes against the environment again and again.  She ran on ethics reform, but is currently under investigation for several  charges involving hiring and firing of state officials. She has NO experience  beyond Alaska.  </font></span><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">&mdash;Christine B., Denali Park, AK</font></p>  <p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""> <font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">As an Alaskan and a feminist, I am beyond words at this  announcement. Palin is not a feminist, and she is not the reformer she claims  to be. </font></span><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">&mdash;Karen L., Anchorage, AK</font></p>  <p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""> <font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">Alaskans, collectively, are just as stunned as the rest of  the nation. She is doing well running our State, but is totally inexperienced  on the national level, and very much unequipped to run the nation, if it came  to that. She is as far right as one can get, which has already been  communicated on the news. In our office of thirty employees (dems, republicans,  and nonpartisans), not one person feels she is ready for the V.P. position.</font></span><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">&mdash;Sherry C., Anchorage, AK</font></p>  <p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""> <font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">She's vehemently anti-choice and doesn't care about protecting our natural resources, even though she has worked as a fisherman. McCain chose her to pick up the Hillary voters, but Palin is no Hillary. </font></span><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">&mdash;Marina L., Juneau, AK</font></p>  <p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""> <font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">I think she's far too inexperienced to be in this position. I'm  all for a woman in the White House, but not one who hasn't done anything to  deserve it. There are far many other women who have worked their way up and  have much more experience that would have been better choices. This is a  patronizing decision on John McCain's part- and insulting to females everywhere  that he would assume he'll get our vote by putting &quot;A Woman&quot; in that  position.</font></span><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">&mdash;Jennifer M., Anchorage, AK</font></p>  <p><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">So Governor Palin is a staunch anti-choice religious  conservative. She's a global warming denier who shares John  McCain's commitment to Big Oil. And she's dramatically inexperienced.</font></p>  <p><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">In picking Sarah Palin, John McCain has made the religious right  very happy. And he's made a  very dangerous decision for our country.</font></p>  <p><font size=""2"" face=""Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"">In the next few days, many Americans will be wondering what McCain's  vice-presidential choice means.  Please pass  this information along to your friends and family.</font></p></lj-cut><br /><br />"

"event","so! status on my health: i've been feeling better (thank god) but tomorrow i have a doctor's appointment at 9:40 am. i need a logical explanation and possibly some prescribed pills to conquer my sore throat/popping ears problem. i refuse to believe it will get better in time because it's been over a week. so after tomorrow, i should know for sure what's wrong with me :)

love life : peachy k :) we're going to (FINALLY) see the dark knight on tuesday.

work life: stressful, as usual. i got cut my hours for next week because i called off wednesday. i was SICK! but i got cut down to 24 hours. that's a full day plus some worth of hours i won't be getting. to be honest, initially i was upset, but i'll take what i get. i'm not going to go down to gilbertsville and beg for any hours mainly because i miss my main squeeze, ethan. but! i have a lot of fun working with aaron and jon. i let them both listen to ""on my chest"" and they love me ten times more because of it ! i am possibly going with dustin to aaron's on tuesday night after the dark knight. i'm friends with aaron and his twin brother, sean, and i know them through work but our ""relationship"" never went further than work/facebook. i want to go because i'm curious as to see how these boys behave outside of a work environment and how we get along. 

all in all, things have been well and just keep getting better !

school is in LESS THAN A MONTH now.

and it's sarah raub's birthday. happy birthday, sweetthanggg"

Tasks must also be realistic and stretching (ie. represent some amount of work on my part).<br /><br /><b>Why 1001 Days?</b><br />Many people have created lists in the past - frequently simple goals such as new year's resolutions. The key to beating procrastination is to set a deadline that is realistic. 1001 Days (about 2.75 years) is a better period of time than a year, because it allows you several seasons to complete the tasks, which is better for organising and timing some tasks such as overseas trips or outdoor activities.<br /><br /><b>Some common goal setting tips:</b><br />1. Be decisive. Know exactly what you want, why you want it, and how you plan to achieve it.<br />2. Stay Focused. Any goal requires sustained focus from beginning to end. Constantly evaluate your progress.<br />3.Welcome Failure. Frequently, very little is learned from a venture that did not experience failure in some form. Failure presents the opportunity to learn and makes the success more worthy.<br />4. Write down your goals. It clarifies your thinking and reinforces your commitment.<br />5.

"event","<font size=""1"">startled, i woke up. two a.m. another night being awoken by a strange dream. the moon was shining brighter than usual through the blinds. i tried to cover my head with the blankets to make the lights disappear but the summer heat and one fan left me close to heat exhaustion. i ripped the covers back and lay there, staring at my ceiling in just my bra and underwear. i was mesmorized. i stared. there was nothing there. the motion sensor light from across the street shut off and all at once my room was filled with complete darkness. i couldn't even see the ceiling at this point. i grasped a handful of covers and rolled over. i still couldn't sleep. something was wrong. something was not right. the clocks red numbers stood out like a sore thumb. 2:53. was i really that out of it for that long? i couldn't fall asleep. i grabbed my cell phone and used it as a light to guide me down the steps. i wasn't hungry, in fact, far from it, but i opted that a snack might do the trick to knock me out. i flipped open the phone and stared at the bright screen, squinting first but then noticeably making out i had one missed call. i fumbled until i saw that it was him. the boy who kept me awake at night. my heart raced so hard i could hear the beating in my ears. calm down, calm down, i told myself. but i was ecstatic. he called. he cared. suddenly being alone in the dark was not so terrifying anymore. i grabbed a snack and raced up the stairs and went over all the things i wanted to tell him. i hopped into bed and the phone was ringing.<br /><br />a groggy man answered the phone with a ""hey baby."" it was him. the man of my dreams. the one i couldn't fall asleep without and the one that i missed more than ever. we talked about nothing and sometimes the silence filled the void in our heart where we wished we could be but at that hour in the morning it was clearly physically impossible. i wanted him next to me, to feel that comfort. i fell asleep to his voice and when i awoke i couldn't help but look around the room for him. the cold hard truth that it was another night of falling asleep without him and waking up with his arms around a body pillow instead of me hit me harder than anything before. i had to go on with my daily life, do things the way i should and complete any tasks that i knew must be done that day. i got ready. i grabbed my keys and headed for the car. halfway down the driveway, i flung my right hand back and slowed down my stride a bit. slower. slower yet until i was at a dead stop. i looked back. he was not there to grab my hand. i felt out of place finishing my walk down to the car. <br /><br />the realization of him not being around makes me feel uneasy and incomplete. when he is there to grab my hand, or even kiss my neck i feel complete. it has been a struggle fulfilling ""life"" without him next to me all of the way. i've become so dependent on a kiss every time before one of us leave the room that i often sit and wait for that kiss rather than get up and just leave. it's hard, it really is, when you love someone so much and you can't have them all to yourself whenever you want like you used to be able to. i want to grow up and run away with you by my side. that is when i will feel complete and have you all to myself. i love you. that's the real reason i'm saying this.</font>"

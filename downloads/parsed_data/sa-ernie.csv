Besides revision can wait until Sunday  Two whole days of week-end!!"

And, really, aside from Hufflepuffs and chocolate, what else do you need?"

"event","I can't help but worry that there are much more important things going on this year than quidditch and the House Cup.  However, after last night's meeting, I can barely contain my HUFFLEPUFF ENTHUSIASM.  So many of the younger students turned out, and this year we have the HEAD BOY on our side <font size=""-2"">and... hopefully... next year as well</font>.  Hannah, I really do think we're doing a fabulous job as prefects, getting the house spirit up in our charges.

Go Badgers!  Hannah, Zacharias, do either of you know offhand when our first game is?  I can HARDLY WAIT.

<font size=""-2"">though I'm not so sure how pleased mum will be when I ask her for money to cover the owl-order supplies... especially so soon after fidelius friends.</font>"

"event","I am very much looking forward to visiting Hogsmeade.  The girls have realised the neccesity of males such as myself and I shall be accompanying Hannah and Susan at the shrieking shack.  Perhaps another Honeyduke's run, too, if there's time.  One can never have too much chocolate.

Did anybody else notice that Seamus Finnigan and Padma Patil were sopping wet at supper tonight?  I found it odd, as it did not rain today.  Additionally, they seemed quite happy with themselves.  Personally, if I was wearing wet clothes in the drafty hall, I would not be smiling.  Does anyone else (perhaps those in closer vicinity to the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor tables??) care to speculate?"

"event","I would just like to state, for the record, that whether your parents or your parents' parents or their parents or grandparents were wizards or Muggles or hippogriffs, it does not matter.

What matters is that you are a witch or a wizard, and what you choose to do with these talents.

My blood's as pure as anyone's, as many of you may know, and those who choose to use that as an excuse to raise themselves above others are obviously afraid of putting in the work and dealing with the real competition from those who, despite ""inferior"" blood, are more skilled wizards than they.

No, it is not my blood that makes me a superior wizard, it's hard work, practice and talent."

Oi!  Woke up at seven, had a shower, got dressed, went to breakfast.  Headed for eight o'clock charms and was (as usual) a bit early.  There were only a couple of people there by the time I got there and I didn't recognize them, but figured they were sixth years I hadn't gotten a chance to know yet- there must be a few of them, after all.  As more people filtered in, I realized this was <i>seventh year</i> Charms.  Nobody said anything to me, but then Cho Chang came in with some friends and gave me a quizzical look.  I bolted out of there as fast as I could before ducking down an empty hallway and checking my planner.  Seems it was Wednesday, not Thursday, and I had eight o'clock <i>Ancient Runes</i>.  Ran as hard as I could, at least until right outside the classroom, before sneaking in.  Was only a minute or so late (early start pays off, after all), but I cannot believe I made such a mistake.

Must be very sure not to let Justin (or others, but especially Justin) find out about this, or he'll be sure to tell me I'm working too hard.  I say I'm working barely hard enough.  This is NEWTs we're talking about and I intend to do at least as well as I did on my owls without neglecting any of my other duties.  Perhaps Hannah will know what to do.  I do trust her, though I feel somewhat ashamed of mixing things up like this.  Maybe it'll just seem funny next week... yes, I suppose so, as long as I can keep my head straight from now on.

"event","Have just received notice of the Hogsmeade dates for this term.  Hufflepuffs may peruse the list in the common room.  Remember, this privilege is extended to third years and above who have turned in a permission form to their head of house.

Very exciting weekend ahead.  Not only will be there be a celebration for the Hufflepuffs (because we are very fun people and not at all because certain parties feel that I need to ""loosen up""), but Saturday is the first Hogsmeade date of the weekend.  Hannah, if you're not going with anyone else, I suggest we head over to Honeyduke's first thing.  My chocolate stash is getting dreadfully low, and I hear that they're releasing some new chocolate frog cards.  Everyone else is, of course, welcome to join us.  Though if you're lucky enough to get a Uric the Oddball, you will have to put up with fervent attempts my part to broker a deal.

I really should be getting to bed.  Ought to get up by seven tomorrow morning- Charms at eight.  As much as I like having access to this and thank Dumbledore for the privelege, if it disrupts my sleep schedule or cuts down on my revision time, I will be upset with myself.  It is rather addictive to write about myself, though, with nobody to tell me to stop."

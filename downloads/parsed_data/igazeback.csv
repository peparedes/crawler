"event","this entry will basically cover nothing of importance, its been awhile since ive updated and i thought i would just write somethin real quik to let the few ppl who r actually interested in reading this a chance to see whats goin down in honkeyvill. i dont have enough credits to graduate from magnolia next year so ima have to take summer school and probably go to an alternative school again except this time its not cause of my behavior but more to help me graduate with less credits and what not. im pretty freaked out about not walkin down the aisle next year so prayers, if ur religous, r greatly appreciated, lol. i recently took up a new hobby which doesnt help me seem more mexican but i just started fishing theirs a pond right down the road from my house and ive been taken trips down there everynow and again and seem to enjoy it very well. well i dont have that much more to say but if u read this leave a comment to let me know that ppl r still thinkin of me somewhere out there in this small world of ours. mucho amor

this conversation can't go on no more 

Cause if i don't let you go, i fear that i might let you know - 
""<em>cause i still love you, this i must confess 
i guess i still need you, i feel i have to tell you this again 
yes i still want you, these words i did not plan</em>"" 

But i better not talk about it cause i rather move on with my life &amp; do what i gotta do."

"event","<p><font face=""Arial"">People really have to fucking stop asking me&nbsp;how I'm doing. When i say that i'm doing great- don't fucking give me that concerned look.&nbsp;That's so annoying. You ask a question, i answer. If it's not the answer you were expecting, i don't really give a shit.&nbsp;Whatthefuck has he been telling you all? Oh let me guess, more falsely made up stories to make himself look good. I wouldn't be surprised at all. It's not like he hasn't done it before. FOR YOUR INFORMATION:&nbsp;I am doing awesome. If you have something to say, say it to my face. But no, instead, you go off assuming silly things about me and discuss it with people I've never talked to in my life. I bet I&nbsp;never cared to&nbsp;talk to you either, so shut up. To those that still thinks I'm crying my eyes out&nbsp;and&nbsp;thinks I'm still sad about the breakup, you can go fuck yourself. I was already over this shit a long time ago. It's people like you&nbsp;that&nbsp;just won't leave me the fuck alone about it. If I don't want to talk to him, that's my&nbsp;problem. If he doesn't want to talk to me, that's his problem. Don't make it yours. Get over it. <br /><br />And as for the people spreading these interesting rumours about me, alright thanks. You got my attention; i'm flattered; cause now&nbsp;i know that you're stupid :)&nbsp;hahah talk all you want. It's annoying, yet amusing </font></p><p><font face=""Arial"">Good day_</font></p>"

"event","<font color=""#808080"">So I went to dimsum with Dianne and Elise at Jumbo yesterday. It amuses me everytime I go there. Last time there was this bus boy with a pissed off look storming right at us and when he got to our table to get our bill, he turned all nice. It was so weird. And THIS TIME it was just horrible. The ladies working there thought we didn't know chinese and one of the cart pushing lady friggen checked me out! hahaha. To make us laugh even more, Dianne happened to find money on the floor. So basically we almost had a free lunch :) <br />Afterwards we headed to the mall to buy things we needed to the chinese new year banquet. I found myself an awesome dress&nbsp;inside XXI. From a girl that doesn't realy like to wear dresses, or even to dress up,&nbsp;I do admit that it was a nice dress that I bought. I think i fell in love with it....&nbsp;<br />In the end I end up going home with a dress and another pair of shoes. I'm addicted to buying shoes. That's another habit i should try to get rid of too..But how?<br />And I really&nbsp;hope that Elise won't end up blackmailing me with those pics she took of me at her house &gt;_&gt; Imagine, me in a pink dress! yeah....very very odd.<br />To sum things up, going out with Dianne and Elise yesterday&nbsp;sure was the most enjoyable day I had all week. I'm sure that I will have another one of these days scheduled to strictly hang out with those two again.&nbsp;It beats hanging out with a big group of friends</font>"

"event","<font color=""#808080"" size=""2"">Okay so I was wrong. Thanks to Elise, I now have a nice looking layout on livejournal. Apparently, the html here is different than edmontononline's or xanga's or any other site.. Again, I will try to figure out how to use this site. If only I had more time.. Maybe I should stop procrastinatiing. That would save me some time! This is one of my&nbsp;messed up habit that I simply cannot quit. sighh~</font>"

"event","<font color=""#808080"" size=""2"">It's 1:56am. I decided to create a live journal account while still using xanga. I'm quite bummed that I couldn't get my tornpanda username. Oh well. I'm sure I joined this site&nbsp;late. And&nbsp;I have a feeling that I&nbsp;won't understand the html on this site.. . kk sleeptime. I will be back in 2weeks. My midterms are here. How lovely *sarcasm*</font>"

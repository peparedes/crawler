I went to northgate tonight, and I ran into a ton of people I never get to see. it was a super night. I didn't drink a ton, nothing got out of control, it was super. I have to be at work at 7am though, so i am cutting this entry short."

I turned 22 last week, needless to say, I feel a little at a loss. Where has the time gone? I for sure wish I was graduating in May, or August, but noooo I have to wait until December. God! I wold rather die then spend another day in this shit hole town. i guess that isn't really fair to college station, but as it has always been, I get so worn out by this place. I really don't have anything to do with this place.

I have a lighting mock up tomorrow night. i have to get the slide projectors, the and slides, and the coloration sticks and get this thing to work before i see jill at 9pm. I don't feel ready since I was in San Francisco all weekend. i have a test in HAVC as well. Not ready for that either, well sort of. I haven't worked in studio in weeks, i hate my prof. At least it is my last studio and then I don't have to worry anymore. My furniture is coming out good, and the brochure for study abroad is coming out as well. I just feel like I spend all day in the architecture building on a computer adn I never really get anything done.

Work is work, and I never get paid what I need, but certainly more than I deserve. I have to pay my speeding ticket in the next few days. that is certainly depressing. I don't know, I just feel a little out of it these days.

Clearly there is no man in my life, well there is Dan in NJ, but who really knows, I haven't seen him in almost a year, it would be nice to get together for a drink when I'm out there. He was a really nice guy. Here at school, it is just one depressing day after another.I started playing a game where I tried to count how many guys I walked by before i saw one I would be willing to kiss...last week I made it to 1,043, thats bad! funny, but bad. I just am ready to get out of here.


I send my acceptance to steve and amanda's wedding today, i am excited for that. otherwise the next few weeks are mostly just a pain in my ass.

argh! I think I am in a bad mood."

"event","So, things are going so much better. I went a a great first date!I realize he might read this, but I'm not saying anything bad, so 'Hi' if you read this. It was so nice. We had sushi and then went to get a cup of coffee and they played edith piaf!!! It was so nice. We just talked and had a great time. So last night I didn't sleep at all because after the date I went to studio (architecture, sickos). I made a model for my crit today, and it went over great. I'm just in a pretty good mood all around."

"event","So things are going a good bit better. I met with my studio professors and they have been very cool. Work is going ok, I'm asking for a raise, and I might have another job lined up with a contractor. That would be awesome. The apartment is so messy, I'm mortified. I got these awesome PJ's from my parents for Valentines Day. A few friends showed up at the restaurant on Valentines Day, it was really nice. It is going to snow a total of 24 inches between yesterday and tomorrow!!!! I've never seen anything like it. It's one of the top 5 storms in the HISTORY of Washington DC!!!! I can't get to work or school, that's awesome. Just chillin."

"event","First entry, wish it was happy. I'd say it's not that I'm unhappy, I'm just not happy. My life in washington hasn't been as fulfilling as I'd hoped. it has it's really good moments, but the everyday is not very complete. I just feel lonely a lot, and I miss my friends in TX and in CA so much. I'm ready to be done this and move on. I'm not motivated for school at all. I feel like I can't get my ideas across. I feel like the people at school are really great, but not my type. The people I know from A+M are by far the nicest. I just am not connected to my life here. I automatically accelerate to the future or the past instead of my depressing present. Today I slept through all my classes because I was feeling sick. It's just not a good time for me. I'm just hanging on to when I get to go back to TX for summer school, and back home to CA.

Living in a big city and not being 21 is so hard. I'm only a couple moths away, but it's tough because I'm the only person i know who isn't 21, so I'm constantly excluding myself from things so everyone else can. That really pisses me off."

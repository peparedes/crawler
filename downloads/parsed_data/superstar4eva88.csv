it sucks waking up on monday mornings....roar
and this morning before the bell rang alicia made me walk down the hall and see all the gay ass ppl i go to school with....it sucked

then alg...well i dont remember what we did

um..nothing else really exciting happened at school

after school liz and alicia came over and hung out for a little while, but then i had to get crackin on my homework, and they went job hunting, which i will eventually have to do....but right now school is a main priority

so they went job hunting and i went to dance
and ERIN WASNT THERE TONIGHT! i was so sad!!! i almost cried
but it was cool i hung out with jenna  who is a cool person too!!! 
in tap we did that awsome song that i still dont know the name to....i will eventually find it out.....

then jazz was ok...jamie taught most of it which is different than leesa but still good
leesa was helping the central kids make up dance combinations for centrals musical because there they actually want to see what u can do dance wise instead of taking ppl just because of what dance school they go to......so it was cool
and i hung out with kait, and we talked about TTB and beat each other up, and kait almost cried when a ""certain song"" came on....cough..""i know i can, be what i wanna be"" cough.......lol good times!!!!!!!!!!


so now im gonna go a sleep because im a loser like that

Don't wanna be an American idiot.
Don't want a nation under the new mania.
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mindfuck America.

Welcome to a new kind of tension.
All across the alienation.
Everything isn't meant to be okay.
Television dreams of tomorrow.
We're not the ones who're meant to follow.
For that's enough to argue.

Well maybe I'm the faggot America.
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda.
Now everybody do the propaganda.
And sing along in the age of paranoia.

well im not THAT obsessed
but its close
its a really good game...plus it has a bunch of the Disney characters..soo its pretty cool

today was an ok day
except that hunter wasnt in school today which sucked but i survived

so in alg.- once again i was thoroughly confused but managed to figure out the homework on my own, which i have to do a lot in that class

then current issues we presented our articles...i think everyone in that class is so burned out from debating on the election..i know i am..but next week we get to play jeapardy the whole week so that is a plus

then in german i kind of zoned out the whole period 
gym=volleyball which was pretty good, even though i am convinced that the gym teachers make us run for more than 5minutes....

english-we talked about the simpsons almost the entire period...i love that class. mr. volpone is such a good teacher

history-pretty good as usual, i kind of zoned in that class too

Lunch- funny as hell as usual..i mean what can u expect???? i think i didnt stop laughing the entire time

Chem-boring...especially on double days like today...i dont really mind mr. gessner because he usually stops class on double lab days early, which is cool, most teachers wouldnt do that, and he shows us funny pictures and videos and stuff

Key Club was uneventful except that i got to hang out with meg for a little while, which was cool, that is one of the only things i miss about marching band, hanging out with meg, kaitlynn, alice, and a few other ppl

o and chelsea named a chair fred...haha...gotta love her

Thursday:
School.....gay as usual except we played volleyball and it wasnt that bad. Luch was funny as hell...all i can say is WE MUST SACRIFICE THE VILLAGERS!!! and Fogey=tomatoes....lol..amazing times at lunch..lol. After school Hunter came over and we watched TV. then me,heather, alicia, hunter, and my mom went to see Grease, it was awsome, especially all the dancing!!! Great job all u Entertainer kiddos!!!!!!!

Friday:
Pretty good day...we got volleyball teams..mine won both games. We also had an assembly that told us the new edition MIGHT be done by January 2006! notice the ""MIGHT"", the assembly was funny because i sat with alicia hunter and evan..lol so anyways...um after school friday i went to the movies with a bunch of ppl and we saw The Incredibles. It was funny but it seemed really long....really long..like 2 1/2 hrs long. After the movie we dropped hunter and came back to my house.i went right to sleep but everyone else was up for a while.....

Saturday:
AWSOME day!! I went to NYC to see the Christmas Spectacular with Hunter and his family. We left really early, well 7, but it seemed really early. then on the way we played funny car games with hunters sister and his little cousins, it was cute....then on the way to the city we kept seeing billboards for Wicked....that was exciting. Then when we got to the city we parked in the parking garage for the Gerschwin Theater where Wicked is playing.....omg.....Wicked was right across the driveway thing...so then we saw the Christmas show, the rockettes and all that jazz, it was really good for the 3rd time...the dancing was really good. and the ice skating was cool. and the rockettes are always good. Then after the show we went to TGIfridays in NYC which was super crowded and it took like 20 mins just to get our menus. but it was cool
then after we ate it was really too cold to walk around times square (it was like walking around in a wind tunnel) so we went back to hunters house, and i hung out with Brielle and we watched a movie...um..i forget the name, but it was pretty good.. then hunter and i hung out after he finished doing his chores then me and hunter went to see the polar express....which was AWSOME
then i came home and watched SNL...haha...soo funny...""switch with me""...hahaha (u wouldnt know unless u watched it last night)
it was a very christmasy day!!

um, so yesterday, i went to lunch with my grandparents and it was really fun.....i love my grandparents (thank god they got their flu shots) they had to wait in a freakin 5hr line, twice.....kind of shows you what Americas come to....76 year old people waiting in 5hr lines just so they wont get sick over the winter.........

anyways, it was really fun talking with my grandparents, i had not seen them since the election has been over....and lets just say my grandma was NOT happy, and it was kind of funny.

after lunch i came home and....um.......o wait i remember Erin came over but then we had to leave to go to the football game

the football game was freaking ridiculously freezing!!! omg!
and then i dropped 3 times because i was so cold......but hey i havent dropped in competition in a long time..so w/e but yeah Voorhees had the same show as us but they went a different direction with it...they sort of actually went for the mystical, sort of cirque du soleil, which is actually what it is as apposed to what we took it as, a silly circus

i definetly think our show was better though, i thought their first song was really good, but then the rest of our show was better....they had a cute dance part too.....o well we shall see who is truly better sunday.........




after the football game erin,alicia,chelsea, liz, and hunter came over, but then hunter and chelsea left and the rest of us hung out and fell asleep, and now i think we r going to bridgewater mall but im not sure

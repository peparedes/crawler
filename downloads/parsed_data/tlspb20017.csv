"event","<font size=""3"">Ok, first I want to say Welcome to my LJ. I am not quite sure where I want to take the direction of LJ just yet, though only time will tell. All I know is that there are many thoughts swirling in my little mind and perhaps this is a place to be. Whether I need to vent at 3am and possibly get commets from friends. On the other hand, however, it may&nbsp;just be&nbsp;to take time for me to reflect on what is going on with just me.&nbsp;Either way, I will probably learn about myself, which is what I'm wishing to gain in writing through LJ. So, with that please do not hesitate to leave comments on my posts, even if they sound critical or negative because I will still learn from it. And do not worry, I will forgive you and will not get mad at you.<br /><br /><br /><br />PS: I'm new, so you may have to teach me the ins &amp; outs of what's going on with LJ. Therefore, comment away!!!</font>"

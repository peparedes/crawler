"event","DLAB = the language aptitude test. 

I have heard that this is the hardest test anybody has ever taken. The Air Force requires a 100 or greater to qualify for linguist. The highest score one can achieve is a 176.
I took the DLAB last Thursday. The AF guys at MEPS were floored when they saw my score, as was I. I managed a 131 on a test that was entirely gibberish. I am being serious. It tests you on your ability to learn a new language, so it wasn't done with real languages. Previous knowledge was useless, except in the case of English grammar. 131. Damn.&nbsp; I rocked that shit. I'm gonna be a linguist ::dances. 
Guess where the school for linguist is?!?! Monterey California!!!! Look it up...it's a beautiful place. School is about a year and a half for the upper level languages. CRAZY!!!

Now I'm just waiting for a call so that I know when I'll be leaving for boot camp. I'm going to start packing up some of my stuff right now so that I'm ready if I leave like next month. EEKS!!!"

"event","So Thursday I took my ASVAB. Totally owned that shit. 
Overall score: 97
Mechanical:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 95
General:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 96
Admin:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 98
Electronics:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 99
(99 is a perfect score)

So yeah, all I had to do was qualify physically for the jobs, and I'd be set.
After the ASVAB, I was shuttled to the hotel. Chilled with my uberquiet roommate, had dinner, then decided to take advantage of the pool and hottub! Was fine there for a bit, and then a herd of guys showed up, all going to MEPS, and yeah.....I was one of two females there. You can guess how that was. Thanfully, Robbie called, came to pick me up, and we went over to his house for a while to chill with his friends for his birthday. 
Back to the hotel by 11, was told that there were guys baning on my hotel door looking for me (or more logically, looking to get laid. Idiots.). I decided to just crash.
Woke up at 4 a.m. Shitty. Dragged my ass down to breakfast, stood in the cold for a bit, hopped into a van, and it was off to MEPS. Once I got there it was a lot of waiting, getting prodded and tested, taking a pee while somebody watched me, and being groped awkwardly by a little vietnamese man. I don't really like going to the doctor's. And to qual for flying, I had to be able to pop my ears for the doctor so he could see if my eardrums move right or something. Well he looked into my left ear, couldn't see my eardrum. Too much wax. So he cleaned it out with a little plastic thingy, and it was all good. Then he went to the right ear, and again, too much wax. Tried to clean that one out and only succeeded in pushing the wax farther in! Holy fucking painful! So they sent me off to have my ear flushed out! Fun. SSgt Gillis (my recruiter) drove me out to Camillus, where a nurse dumped peroxide into my ear (weirdest noise/feeling ever!!!), and then shot warm water into my ear with what looked like a thing you use to inject marinade into meat. Nasty chunk of wax bigger than a pencil eraser. Lovely. It was really nice being able to hear again out of my right ear.

And the joy of that whole ordeal?!?! IT DIDN""T MATTER!!!! I passed that test for flying, but I'm a QUARTER INCH TOO SHORT!!!!! Shitty! But I still qualified for a shit ton of jobs. I put down intelligence as my top choice. Pretty awesome.

Oh! And I am scheduled to take another test called the DLAB Thursday. If I do well enough on that, I'll be a linguist. No question. It'll be awesome much! So wish me luck on that!!!!


This concludes my MEPS update. I'll let you know when more happens regarding my military whatnot! Love y'all!"

"event","So apparently not everyone in fandom ran around in circles with their hands in the air when the promos for a silly action flick starring The Rock and Sean William Scott first graced the airwaves.

Again, I am boggled, because <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0327850/"">The Rundown</a> is just one of the most delightfully fun action movies I've ever seen.  Not to mention the fact that it's hella slashy.  The Rock plays Beck, an enforcer who'd much rather be listening to Emeril while serving up creations in his own dream kitchen, but alas, is stuck beating up men twice his size due to the dirt the boss has on him.  The boss, however, offers him an out after one last job: retrieve his wayward son, Travis (Sean William Scott).  Which is how Beck ends up on the jungle adventure from hell, trying to figure out whether to kill or <s>kiss</s> save Travis while evading horny monkeys, angry rebels, and, oh yeah, Christopher Walken as the baddy.

As <lj user=""stillane""/> said, think of it as Romancing the Stone, only with two guys.  (Before you get your hopes up, the movie doesn't <i>actually</i> go there.  But it's got all the right tropes to make you wonder why it doesn't.)

Speaking of <lj user=""stillane""/>, she's just written a fabulous bit of fic for the movie.  <a href=""http://stillane.livejournal.com/44495.html"">Settle</a>, Travis/Beck, R, 3500 words.  I told her that while I love the movie, <i>breathtaking</i> isn't usually a word I associate with it, but that's exactly how her story struck me.  It's Travis making himself part of Beck's life after the end of the movie, and Beck not being sure how he feels about that.  An elegant story that still has the thrill of the movie, and really brings the connection between the two characters to the forefront.

I think The Rundown classifies as a close to nonexistent fandom.   The only other stories I know of are <a href=""http://yuletidetreasure.org/archive/fandom_rundown.html"">here</a> at <a href=""http://yuletidetreasure.org"">Yuletide Treasures</a>.  So go.  Watch.  Read.  Write more fic!"

"event","<a href=""http://www.yuletidetreasure.org/archive/30/ayear.html"">A year in the life (or seven times Betty and Daniel showed each other they cared)</a>.  Ugly Betty, Daniel and Betty (friendship or mild romance), PG.  <i>Betty and Daniel, through the year.</i> Like the show, full of sweet, gentle moments between the two.

<a href=""http://www.yuletidetreasure.org/archive/23/chasingcars.html"">Chasing Cars</a>.  The Pretender, Jarod/Miss Parker, PG.  <i>It's not just about the hunt anymore; maybe never was.</i> Quite possibly my favorite Yuletide fic this year.  It's short and full of punch and tension, keeping me on the edge of my seat with every word.

<a href=""http://www.yuletidetreasure.org/archive/26/herculesex.html"">Hercules ex Machina</a>.  Hercules the Legendary Journeys, gen, PG.  <i>A typical day in the life of Hercules and Iolaus.</i>  This is just a great romping adventure in perfect HtLJ style.  And the title is the icing on the cake. :)

<a href=""http://www.yuletidetreasure.org/archive/32/downtime.html"">Downtime</a>. Eureka, Carter/Stark, R (but I would call it more PG, myself). <i>Jack Carter finally gets a damned vacation.</i>  I love this one.  I'm not really interested in pairings for Eureka, and I'm eh about the slash, but when it's done well, I do enjoy it.  This is done well.  It's got that irreverent, goofy tone that the show itself does, but with the bit of undercurrent that makes the show interesting.  Spoilers for the season ender.

<a href=""http://www.yuletidetreasure.org/archive/25/huntingpermit.html"">Hunting Permit</a>.  Coldfire Trilogy, Damien/Gerald, PG. <i>Damien has a new job. The weather could be better. </i>  Another favorite.  The author has a real touch for the world of the books, and does a great job of building the tension between Damien and Gerald.

<a href=""http://yuletidetreasure.org/archive/26/startfrom.html"">Start From Now</a>. Profiler, John and Bailey, R.  <i>""Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending."" --Carl Bard </i>  The story written for me!  It's John frantic about Bailey after the shooting, and it's fabulous."

"event","<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/tigs/485865.html"">Untiled Lorne-Sheppard Ficlet</a> by <lj user=""tigs""/>, gen, spoilers for <i>Intruder</i>.  We don't have a lot of canonical background information on John Sheppard, but we've gotten enough glimpses to know that he's not exactly the golden boy of the Air Force.  Set after Siege III back at the SGC, <lj user=""tigs""/> asks the question: <i>how would the new personnel see their commanding officer to be?</i>.  Told from Major Lorne's perspective, it's an insightful look at Sheppard.


<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/coreopsis/729405.html"">Taste of Blood</a> by <lj user=""coreopsis""/>, McKay/Sheppard, no porn.  This is a short ficlet, but it's one of my favorites. Set sometime in early season 1, it has both of them being a little dorky and a little heroic, with a brief detour into hot.  I mostly love it for the depth of feeling it gets across without being overly maudlin or mushy.

<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/carleton97/134190.html"">Mise-en-Scene</a> by <lj user=""carleton97""/>, McKay/Sheppard, no porn.  Another very short ficlet that gets across the depth of the emotion between the two in a very simple, realistic way."

"event","Welcome!  To kick things off, I'm going to start with a batch of NCIS recs, most of them products of the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/blueraccoon/383890.html"">ficathon</a> sponsored by <lj user=""blueraccoon""/>.  I'm pretty easy with pairings in this fandom.  If it's good, it's good.

<b>Featured story:</b>  
<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/thenewhope/96983.html"">Everyone Here Is Wrong</a> by <lj user=""thenewhope""/>.  Tim/Abby, Tony/Tim, post-Twilight.  Before you freak out because of the pairing, really think about giving this one a chance.  Told from McGee's point of view, it really captures the odd disconnectedness that must surely follow the events of Twilight.  Things are a mess, in every possible way. I love how stark and silent each individual moment in this story is, like there's an overwhelming emotional energy that just dampens the outside world.

<i>Tony stays silent, his gaze stuck on some point above the NCIS insignia on the wall and left of nowhere. Abby's still got her arms rapped loosely around herself, and Tim watches as her eyes jump from point to point, looking anywhere but at Tony. He feels like he's the buffer between two opposing currents, like he's a breath away from being crushed under the silence that's between them.</i>

And the moment, when it comes, seems natural and inevitable, like there is no other possible scenario to consider.  Please give this story a try.


<b>Other good stories to check out:</b>

<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/the_green_sheep/477.html"">Precious Things</a> by <lj user=""the_green_sheep""/>.  Slight Gibbs/DiNozzo, post-Twilight.  An introspective action piece?  Yeah, sounds odd, but the author manages to catch the turmoil of Tony's thoughts post-Twilight while still making this a very visceral story, and making sure what we know what's going on with Gibbs even though he's racing on ahead.

<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/twoweevils/76585.html#cutid1"">Between Good and Better</a> by <lj user=""twoweevils""/>.  Gibbs/DiNozzo, NC-17.  Tony's on vacation, and he just has to call Gibbs.

<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/kate98/51913.html"">Strangers and Friends</a>, by <lj user=""kate98""/>.  Gen, team fic. Palmer doesn't show up for work, which is highly unusual.  Kind of sweet, kind of angsty, with good team interaction and action.

<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/kate98/17820.html"">Safe Driver</a>, by <lj user=""kate98""/>.  Gibbs & Abby, kind of Gibbs/Abby.  Abby needs a ride home, so she calls Gibbs.  I like the fact that this story keeps their relationship at a believable level, even though it might have been hotter to have them fucking in an alley.

<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/the_haunt/105175.html"">The Visitor</a>, by <lj user=""the_haunt""/>.  Palmer comes to dinner.  Told from Ducky's mother's POV.  Hilarious.  Slight Palmer/Ducky.

<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/meadowlion/60400.html"">The Things You Do</a> by <lj user=""meadowlion""/>.  Tony/McGee, NC-17 (also Tony/McGee/f).  McGee finds Tony on his spring break, and he has a plan.  Quite hot, and rather sweet.  I like the take-charge Tim in this, something we see hints of on the show but hasn't quite broken through yet.  (And apparently, I've developed a thing for this pairing.  I blame the 'cookie crumbs in hair' scene. *g*)"

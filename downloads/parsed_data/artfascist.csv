"event","Hey, so I'm finally temping somewhere, ironically for another online university. No more sales, though. I have sworn that off for life. My job is more like what I would term ""glorified secretary,"" but it's alright. I am in a cube and hardly anyone talks to me. Eeeehhhhhhxxx-celent.

I also got in touch with Eric tonight, (an old friend, and one-time boyfriend,) who basically said that he'd like to play music with me when he comes back up to Chicago over the summer. It's such a huge opportunity, because first of all, Eric is very talented, (when he sent me his second album, I wanted to hate it, but found myself loving it instead,) and second of all, he is very driven. Which is something that I lack. I can dream all I like in my head about having my own band and recording contract and all that, but when it comes down to recording and contacting record companies to look for contracts, I am not your girl.

It's kind of funny. I've reached this crucial point in my life, which is the age of 25. I'm almost 25 now, and if I want to pursue music, then THIS is the time. This is the ""shit or get off the pot"" time. I need to give it a try, and even if I fail, then I can go back to being a glorified secretary with the knowledge that at least I had a go.

Cheers, mates."

"event","So I'm looking around for jobs, again, naturally. careerbuilder.com is the biggest piece of shit ever. All of the jobs advertised there are either obviously fake (""SPORTS PROMOTION!!! ENTRY LEVEL!!!) or require way too much experience (""Administrative assistant, 3-5 years experience required).

[A quick note about that admin assistant thing: How has the economy come to this???!! I'm 24 years old, almost 25, and I remember being told as a child, ""If you go to college, you'll be set for life. Anyone who has a degree gets a great, stable job that pays well."" Does anyone else remember getting this line of crap? I know it was a different time, but I'm PISSED! I want my job! It's not that I WANT to be lazy, or unemployed, (not that I'm complaining about getting enough sleep or having the chance to read and play piano and what not,) ....... where was I? Oh yeah, I don't want to be lazy and live on the dole, but the job market is just so shitty right now. When companies can require 5 years experience in their SECRETARIES, you know you're shit-out-of-luck.]

What I really want to do is start a band, but I'm such a coward. I know I have some good songs, and that I could certainly play in a rock band, but I'm afraid to go out looking for bandmates. I have also always felt that getting into a band should be some sort of organic thing, like you make a friend in college who invites you to join his or her band, or maybe you have had a friend since childhood who plays the guitar and one day you guys decide to try your hand at punk rock. That sort of thing. It's kind of intimidating to go out, solo, and look for mates. Plus, while I don't necessarily have to be the leader, I'm afraid I'd try to take too much control for the member that may be perceived as a ""fly by night,"" coming in with my ideas and songs. Ugh."

"event","<P>I have heard a lot about livejournal.com, and decided to have a go, so please excuse me if this doesn't sound like a whole lot at first. I've never been very good about writing in diaries, nor do I ever feel quite comfortable with writing to myself via some silly book. It always comes out sounding stilted and awkward. Hopefully, I'll settle into a groove. That's the aim anyway.</P>
<P>Well, my main priority right now is to find a job, oddly enough. I've been unemployed for about a month now, and I really need a source of income again. I worked for a really bogus online university up until the last week of January. It was terrifying, but also something of a relief, when I was fired. I hadn't ""sold enough subscriptions"" as my father had put it. I thoroughly hated sales, and delight in no longer having to push higher education on people who obviously don't want it that badly. If you've ever seen <EM>Boiler Room</EM>, then you've seen my former job. I just saw that movie two nights ago and it gave me the chills. The whole atmosphere in that office was incredibly weird, simultaneously intimidating and ridiculous. Most&nbsp;of my co-workers were kind of d**b, (I feel bad thinking that because I sound like a pretentious fuckwit, but they were,) and many were pretty uneducated. Yet they were pushing college on potential leads, most of whom only inquired about the school because they were curious about online learning. No one actually wanted to go to our school. Who would want to go to a school with no name?</P>
<P>(Of course, I cannot say which university it was, as I signed a confidentiality agreement with them.)</P>
<P>So instead of pursuing my true love, which is music, (I play piano and write songs, and have always wanted to form a band,) I am searching for another soul-sucking job. Every day when I was working at the university, I'd wake up with Radiohead running through the brain: ""A heart that's full up like a landfill, a job that slowly kills you, bruises that won't heal....""</P>
<P>Okay, well I think this is enough for now. I must remember to actually write in this thing. Like I said, I am notoriously bad at keeping journals.</P>"

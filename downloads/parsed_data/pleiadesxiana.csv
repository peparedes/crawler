"event","like do you think of me and what are you thinking of me

like us and the future, if you want to stay with me or go away someday, I think that you wouldn't

about how amazing you are and how much I love you

about how much it would hurt if you did go away, and how much it hurts that you are with me

how cute you are and how much I love your smile

how we get along great together and perfectly match



I think about you a lot you know......so much it makes me cry...........(happiness)"

"event","Just noticed that LJ has changed their look. Yay rah, I wonder how long it's been changed. I don't update this thing often as you can see.


I sit in my room all alone
wondering what you are doing while you're at home
I am awake have been all day
you're probably sleeping since you have to work today
I miss you even though I spent all weekend with you
Now I'm scared to wake you so that I can spend a little more time with you."

"event","i often wonder...how it would feel to be struck by lightning. does it feel like getting shocked but by a much stronger source?? i wonder a lot of things...especially feeling wise...like how does it feel when you have a baby inside you or what does it feel like when you have contacts in...stupid stuff like that...or what does it feel like when you have heartburn. it seems odd but i must have a lot of things explained to me feeling wise. or even otherwise. like i can't tell if a coke is flat, it tastes the same to me. just weird stupid little stuff like that makes me wonder."

"event","I went to the show this past Monday, and I'm sad to say that I was actually disappointed.  I understand that a band is going to concentrate on their songs from the most recent album, but they didn't play ONE of my ultimate favourites.  No <i>Jo Jo's Jacket</i>.  No <i>The Hook</i>.  No <i>Jenny & the Ess-Dog</i>.  No <i>Dark Wave</i>.  No <i>Mama</i>. No <i>Vanessa From Queens</i>.  I admit that I like the first two albums better than the last two, but throw me a bone, Stevie.  The closest I came to one of my faves was <i>Pencil Rot</i> and <i>Dragonfly Pie</i>.  The performance was rather good, but to sit in anticipation of one of my faves through the whole show and be left feeling let down kinda sucked.

But all was not lost.  Blitzen Trapper opened the show and they were great.  It was one of those rare instances that I actually wished that the opening act was the closing act.  Blitzen Trapper played most of the songs from their latest album <i>Furr</i>, which I had only listened to twice before the show, but those tunes are excellent.  They were tight.  

Oh well.  No more gigs on the immediate horizon."

The man is talented but it seems almost like a soundtrack....it's good sleepy-time music.  It has no balls.  I should try playing it when I want Natasha to go to bed.  Maybe I'm making a hasty opinion, considering that I've only given it one go-through, but I fail to see myself doing a 180 on this.  Radiohead's best album was <i>The Bends</i> and their last exceptional album was <i>OK Computer</i>, but everything since then has been disappointing to me.

I just viewed a couple of her new videos for songs from her new album.  Some people may say her new sound (and look) is a departure, but I'd equate it to someone who is pandering to the lowest common denominator.  In the past, I thought that she had a distinctive sound, although her vocals could become somewhat annoying.  On the two new songs/videos, she sounds and looks like every other trollop who is releasing music these days, like a Pussycat/Lohan/Aquilera/Spears mishmash.  It seems that one of her previous singles, ""Shit on the Radio"", is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

"event","The Edmonton Oilers beat the Detroit Red Wings tonight.  I worked till after 9pm tonight but got home in time for the last 3 minutes of the game.  It was perfect timing because I was fortunate enough to see Ales Hemsky score with just over one minute left in the game to put the Oilers ahead 4-3.  It has been too long since I've seen Edmonton win a playoff series.

The strangest thing is that when Winnipeg still had the Jets, I loathed the Oilers (mainly because they always kicked our ass in the playoffs).  However, since the Jets moved to Phoenix, I've adopted Edmonton as my favourite team.  Great stuff."

"event","It was recently announced that the new version of INXS with Canuck lead singer J.D. Fortune was coming to town.  I thought that to be a mildly sucky concert.  But just a couple of days ago, the newspaper announced that the opening act would be Scott Stapp.  That brings it to an unimaginable level of suckiness.  I dare you to suggest a suckier combination in the rock genre than that."

"event","Today, Nic went out with my Mom and purchased a diaper-changing/storage cabinet.  Of course, some assembly was required.  When I must put furniture together, I invariably get frustrated.  The instructions are often vague and the illustrations generally look nothing like the actual pieces.  And if it is an imported item, the translation of the instructions is pretty awful as well.  I lucked out this time, because it was actually made in Canada, so things went relatively smooth.

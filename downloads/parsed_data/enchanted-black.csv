I've been trying to wrap my head around currency conversion, visas, bringing the cats over, and all the other stuff that is required to do to move overseas. Normally, I'd just give up. Not this time. I'm too fucking old to keep living like I am. I'm tired of not doing what I've wanted to do for so long because I've become complacent with things. 

Now excuse me, I've got to stop my cat from eating the plastic on the trash can (Leela has a thing for plastic)."

The men in the dirt, if they weren&rsquo;t stone dead, could have attested to that. Augustine kicked one of them with the toe of her worn combat boot. &ldquo;Good, they&rsquo;re all dead,&rdquo; she said in a voice barely above a whisper. She raised her eyes to us and tilted her head to the side. &ldquo;What do we have here?&rdquo;<br /><br />Lavinia stepped forward. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Augustine, Lavinia.&rdquo;<br /><br />Augustine shrugged. &ldquo;Means nothing to me.

When Helen awakes Rose is missing and she's outside of a supposedly abandoned warehouse.<br />Note: This was originally posted on 10/09/08 on&nbsp;<lj comm=""pixelfiction""/>&nbsp;. I moved it here for prosperity's sake.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000kxbpb"" /><br /><lj-cut text=""I've felt dead so long, I forgot what it was like to live""><br /><a name=""cutid1""></a><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000phxay"" /><br /><br />The darkness slowly slipped away. Helen could feel the coldness of the ground. With her eyes closed she inhaled deeply. The smell of crisp autumn air, dirt, and rust met her nose. She sat up slowly feeling every muscle in her body cry out in protest. She wasn't interested in what it had to say. Only one thing was on her mind.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;I've got to find Rosie.&quot;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000pksh3"" /><br /><br />Helen walked through the fog that had settled around the area. She noticed that she was no longer on the backwoods country road she had been driving on. She was somewhere else and she wasn't entirely sure where &quot;somewhere else&quot; was.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the darkness she could make out a building. As she came closer she realized it was the old abandoned warehouse in the town of Hurley's Pass. When she was a young girl growing up in Hurley's Pass she had heard people say the place was haunted. If a child or teen went missing they blamed it on the spirit that lurked in the old warehouse. The missing kids never turned up and the people continued to blame something none of them could say for certain actually existed. Helen knew they weren't lying; she had seen blurs of the thing when her friends and her would hang around the warehouse. Two of her friends went missing the summer before her senior year. She knew it was real.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Helen shook her head as if to clear it. There was no way she could be in Hurley's Pass. Hurley's Pass was 50 miles from Soma Vale and in the opposite direction. What in the hell was going on?<br /><br />Helen walked up to the door of the warehouse, noting that the electricity still worked in the place. &quot;That's odd,&quot; she murmured as she pushed against the door. It opened slowly, creaking omniously on its hinges.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000ppcwe"" /><br /><br />As expected the warehouse was rundown and graffiti artists had virtually turned it into an art gallery. In the dim light Helen could make out tags and amateur art. The place smelled of oil, mold and something that Helen didn't expect. Blood.<br /><br />She glanced around for any sign that Rose might have been here. Helen's instincts told her that Rose was in fact there and not far from her.<br /><br />&quot;Rose! Rosie! Are you here? It's mom, baby! Where are you?&quot;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000pqr60"" /><br /><br />Helen was about to shout for Rose again when she saw her daughter dash from behind a bunch of boxes and run towards an opened door nearby.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Rose, wait! It's just mom!&quot; Helen shouted as she followed behind Rose.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000pre57"" /><br /><br />Helen could tell something was wrong. She could feel it in the way the air suddenly became icy and the smell of blood assaulted her as she approached the rusty door. It was still open from where Rose had disappeared behind it.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000pt89d"" /><br /><br />Helen entered the room cautiously. A sinister feeling enveloped her. This room was much darker to the point that Helen could barely make out anything save for the metal tables and a chair in the far left corner of the room. It appeared to be a wheelchair and someone appeared to be in it.<br /><br />Helen stood still for a moment. &quot;Rose, come on, sweetie. It's time for us to go. Stop playing.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I'm not your Rose,&quot; replied the person in the seat.&nbsp;<br /><br />The voice made the hairs on Helen's arms stand on end. Her blood felt as if it had frozen in her veins.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Then who are you?&quot;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000pwk9w"" /><br /><br />The person stood up, moving as if submersed in water. &quot;Who am I? Why Helen Kensington I'm surprised you have forgotten me. You grew up in this town. You are a part of this town. How can you forget me?&quot;<br /><br />Helen tried to move away but her feet would not heed her mind. Fear was starting to creep up on Helen as the figure turned around slowly. Helen's heart began thumping in her chest, fit to burst .&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000pxy1w"" /><br /><br />The person lunged at her. In that instant Helen knew who it was. She screamed, jumping away from the creature.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Fuck!&quot; Helen exclaimed.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000pyz8z"" /><br /><br />Helen calmed down enough to think coherently. &quot;You aren't even supposed to exist. I thought that you were gone.&quot;<br /><br />The creature chuckled darkly. &quot;I'm never gone, Helen. I own this town. I am this town. Your family knew that.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Why am I&nbsp;here?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Because I&nbsp;need something from you.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000pzrhq"" /><br /><br />Helen gulped. &quot;What is that?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Your daughter. Your family never did give me the sacrifice I wanted. I've been good but I never got the soul I was promised. Your father told me he'd give me you, but you were corrupted early. I&nbsp;couldn't eat your soul. I want your daugther's soul. So pure. So innocent.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No! Stay away from her! You can have me! Don't you dear lay a finger on her!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh, Helen. The deal is older than you. You can't go making deals when you have no power left in you.&quot;<br /><br /><br />THE&nbsp;NEXT&nbsp;MORNING<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000q07p4"" /><br /><br />Rose woke up underneath a desk. She could see the sun shining through a broken window. She wondered how in the world she had gotten there but decided that wasn't exactly important. What was important was finding her mom.&nbsp;<br /><br />She got up and ran out of the room. The stairs leading down to the first floor were slick with water from where rain had entered through a hole in the ceiling. She didn't care she still ran down them shouting her mother's name.<br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000q1xk5"" />&nbsp;<br /><br />She spotted a door that was cracked open. Her curiousity getting the better of her, she entered.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000q2kdy"" /><br /><br />Rose glanced down not expecting to find her mother lying on the floor. Was she sleeping? Rose knelt down beside her and tried shaking her awake.<br /><br />&quot;Mom, get up. I'm ready to go home now. It's morning. Mom?&quot; She shook her again.&nbsp;<br /><br />Helen laid motionless on the floor. Rose noticed that her mother appeared paler than usual and her hands were like ice. Rose put her hand over her mother's heart. Nothing. &quot;Mommy? Mommy, wake up! Please!&quot; Rose felt the tears roll down her nose, hot and heavy. &quot;Mom!&quot;<br /><br />Somewhere in the dark corners&nbsp; something laughed and clutched its hands together in victory.&nbsp;<br /><br />*The end (or is it really*<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut>"

Helen Dorsey hated long country roads. She loved the city with its noise, pollution and millions of people. Out in the country no one would hear you scream if you were stopped by a raving axe murderer. She was grateful to be heading back to Soma Vale. She needed as much distance as she could get from her ex-husband, Vincent. She understood that her daughter, Rose, wanted to see her father but Helen just hated going to pick her up from his cottage where he lived with his young, blonde girlfriend and her fluffy annoying dog.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000kz0c3"" /><br /><br />Rose glanced over at her mother. She could tell she wanted to say something, ask a question about how Rose's stay with Vincent had went. Instead Helen kept her mouth closed. Rose studied her&nbsp; mom a few seconds more before she spoke. &quot;You can ask how it was, you know?&quot;<br /><br />Helen felt the flush creep up into her skin. Had it been that obvious?<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000p0d0d"" /><br /><br />&quot;What do you mean, Rosie?&quot; Helen asked, trying to avoid the subject.&nbsp;<br /><br />Rose shook her head. &quot;No getting around it, mom. You want to know how my visit with dad went and if he said anything about me going to live with him.&quot;<br /><br />Helen shook her head. &quot;I wasn't going to ask anything like that, honey. Besides you said you had a good time when you got in the car. It's okay.&quot;<br /><br />Rose knew it wasn't but decided against arguing with Helen.<br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000p21f9"" /><br /><br />&quot;Besides,&quot; Helen said slowly, &quot;if you want to live with your dad you know you can. I&nbsp;won't stop you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Really? But I don't want to anyhow. I'd rather be with you,&quot; Rose replied, a yawn escaping as she spoke. &quot;I like the city way too much to move to the middle of the woods.&quot;<br /><br />Rose turned her attention to the trees speeding past them. This road didn't look familiar to her. It seemed as if they were going out of the way, heading deeper into the woods.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000p38zb"" /><br /><br />&quot;Mom, are we going the right way?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yeah. Why do you ask?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It's just that...Mom! Look out!&quot; Rose shouted pointing ahead of them to where a person stood in the road.<br /><br />Rose screamed as Helen suddenly slammed on brakes. The car careened across the road, slamming sideways into a tree.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000p42r6"" /><br /><br />Rose put her hand up to her face to feel if she were bleeding.Thankfully she wasn't. She could hear her mother beside her asking her if she were alright. &quot;I'm fine, mom,&quot; she mumbled.<br /><br />Helen undid her seat belt, talking as she did. &quot;I'm going to get you out, sweetie. Just hold on.&quot; Helen got out of the car and stood up on wobbly legs. Before she could reach over and undo Rose's seat belt she fainted on the cold asphalt.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000p55sc"" /><br /><br />Helen woke up not knowing how much time had passed. It must not have been a lot for it was still dark. She tried to get her bearings, remembering what had happened. Rose had pointed to a person and they had slammed into a tree.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Rose! Oh god!&quot; Helen thought as she tried to get up. Her legs still would not cooperate. This time when she passed out she could hear Rose's voice as if coming from somewhere far away.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/enchanted_black/pic/000p6xwq"" /><br /><br />*to be continued*</lj-cut>"

I was thinking about maybe leaving the burrow to the boys...and moving into the muggle world. i would still work at the ministry..but There really is nothing here for me..\



What do you think?"

 I am sorry it has been so long since we last talked. Alot has been happening. A new coffee shop opened up and the owner is a lovely young woman named cayden. She brought me a broken E-s-p-r-e-s-s-o maker. I was most thrilled. Fred came back!! I don't exactually know where he went ..but it is nice to see him again. Katie and George are married..but not doing to well. Katie is rekindleing her family ties with the malfoys. 


A few days ago i did something bad.....I am sorry darling but i could not bear to lose another family member. 

Fred is doing well. I have not spoken to ron or ginny in a while. I should check up on them. 

I am thinking of turning myself in. The guilt is too great. I hurt George...and i do not feel as fufilled as si thought i would. 


Azkaban cannot be that bad...can it? 

I shall consult Remus on this matter. 

I miss you darling...

My Typewriter? has just arrived. Thank you sooo much George. I immeditaly took it to the shop and went about trying to take it apart. It has alot of pieces. Thankfully I was able to put Some of it back together and enchant it to a point where it will work on its own. I read in a book that you are supposed to slip paper into the top half and type on the bottom half..the workds will show up on the paper as you type. Well i played with this for a bit...wrote a few notes to molly ..george and fred. Then i decided the typeing was a bit laborious. So now...you can dictate to the typewriter and it will type just what you want. 

I am such a Genius...

In other news. Nothing really big happened today. I went back to work (sadly) and it was thankfully quiet. We have a series of spells to investigate in the works. (someone thought it fun to hex a bunch of toasters in nothern ireland.) so they are on their way to the ministry (dang drunk irish) so that will keep me busy for a bit. 

Nothing huge..i hope the childeren are alright.

"event","Well I said i would Be  coming back to you a bit later tonight. And look, it is later!

   Molly is worried about the twins joining the order. She has every right to worry but I can see why the boys want to join. I am just worried about their wellbeing. I plan on Giving them a bit of extra training in defensive spells so they are a bit more aptly prepared for whatever is thrown at them. 

  I am worried about the four muskateers. They just up and flew away. I cannot say I Blame them and they Are old enough to go out on their own..i am just worried. Call it a parents perogative. I am dreading my return to work to a degree, I hate the idea of leaving Molly alone at the burrow for long bouts. I don't know how tied up at the office i will be with all this and that that has arisen. Maybe I can convince tonks to stay and keep her company. Not that molly cannot take care of herself, The burrow is sorta a second home base..and it should be protected. 

By whozitts i just got word that Lupin nominated Molly and I to be the head of the otder. This just might work. We can keep an eye on the twins, and split the responsabilities of running the order just like we run the household (though ithink there will be less cooking in the order) and would it not be bittersweet to see the look on Malfoy (wherever he may be)'s face when he sees us in all our sneeky voldemort-thwarting glory. (say that aloud dear reader for it is quite amuseing) The order is going to visit this issue more at the next meeting ..we need to get this resolved so we can move on to more pressing things (like oh i don't know...thre return of the death eaters in full force...yeah that is a good one) 

Anyway dear journal, I should really be heading to bed. I have to contact the ministry tomorrow and see just how much i have missed. So for now this is good night

...Please keep my family save....the ones that i share blood with and otherwise.

"event","Well it is official, I have married off one boy..

The wedding was ..interesting, but all who need to know what happened know. 
Now that the fuss is over I must sadly return to my ministry duties. I wish i could take a honeymoon like Bill and Fluer. Oh well, maybe Molly and I will sneak away if this whole fiasco calms down a bit. 

My project will arrive on friday, I am thrilled



And yes dear Journal, I cried like a baby at the wedding. 

Must be off now, Molly is calling

(For those that don't know, this is April. Though we aren't together anymore romantically, she is still one of my closest friends. She is a wonderful writer. Many of the camping trips we took together were also research trips for this book. It is a tween adventure novel but it is just as engrossing for the adults too. So, if you're able to pitch in, please do so. If you donate enough, you'll get a copy and get a glimpse into the beautiful state I live in. It is far prettier than the TV shows let on. Mostly because you just have to get out of the city. Love and Hugs, Ellie)"

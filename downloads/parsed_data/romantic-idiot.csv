Some people seemed to have wavered a bit during the ""break up"" but that isn't to be spoken of enless it's to thier face, or where they can't hear me...:) kidding....sort of. But I'm not sure what's happening. </P>
<P>Right now someone is singing in my ear and it's quite nice...:D It has never been this way before. It's been like ...hah, a day? </P>
<P>Today would have been mine and Melissa's 16 month...God was it really that long? :/ I never ever saw that coming. Didn't think it would last a month, much less 15 more. but what ever, that's that. Time to start over with new beginings. </P>
<P>I'm still unsure about one person, and they know who they are. Things were...typed? and said, I guess. oh well, things happen.</P>

But it back fired on her and now I can't wait.
It sounds like such a rush and such a great experience. 
I want to go there get my work done and meet a shit load of people and make a life.
Fuck civilianship, I WANT to be Military Personal.

I want to go.
I want to be 19.
I want time to fly.

I'm not saying I want to leave all my friends and loved ones as soon as posseble.
But I want to get the hell out of here, I want to get the hell out of this house.
I want to get out and travel the world.
If I get on the SS George Washington, which I most likely will, I will not only be on the best ship in the entire Fleet, but I will also be going to Japan.
That has been my dream since I was 9 years old.
Everything is starting to look up."

I'm tired. Bored. Not feeling well, suddenly. my neck, legs, back, foot, head, eyes, and fingers all hurt. Badly. I keep having to pull eyelashes out becuase they get tangled. Is it healthy to like the feeling of hair being pulled out? Because I like it. Not in clumps but one strand at a time. Hmm. Maybe I'm weird. (pulls out another eyelash.......and another......and another...and another) Anyway. going to call Melissa in a few and tell her goodnight because I'm going to bed. (yawn) 

I find myself not wanting to be around my friends anymore. Not all of them. Just...more of ones that keep letting me down. .....hmm.....Oh well. Fuck. 8:54. ^ minutes until O.C in over and I can call her and bring her back to the reality that is this....umm...place. 

I'm getting better at my art. I've been doing better at it then I have in...about a month. Now if only I could work on that whole ""man I can't write"" thing. Fuckshit. I miss being depressed and having something to write about. 

8:56


I played in the snow with my sister again tonight. We shoveled the driveway and the sidewalks and I ran into the garage and got my little snow/skate board thingy that I love and she got hers. She sucks at it but she tries. She's better at it then Melissa. haha. The snow was fun. It was the good kind. You pick it up and it's already a snowball. I hope there's like some amazing snowfall/ice tonight and we don't have school. I hate school now. I like being home again. Something i havn't done in a while. 

Man my foot is falling asleep....
Oh well. 

Who am i kidding, no ones reading all of this. 

(pulls another eyelashout)
Time to go call. 8:59
G'night."

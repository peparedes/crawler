"event","I got my disability review paperwork in the mail a couple weeks ago. I've been staring at it like it's trying to kill me since then. I kind of feel like it *is* trying to kill me. It's a totally routine thing, everyone who gets disability benefits is on a review cycle. Alice says it's a 3, 5, or 7 year cycle (I think) and I could have sworn I have done it at least once before but I've only had benefits for 4 years. My diagnosis was 6 years ago though so maybe I'm on a 3 year cycle and they started on my diagnosis date and that's why I think I've done it before? Anyway, they sent me the long form which I of course took as some crazy sign that they are terminating my benefits and I'm going to have to move or try to get a job which I will lose as soon as a flare which won't take long because OMG SO MUCH STRESS RIGHT NOW. I forced myself to fill it out tonight so I can mail it tomorrow so my benefits don't get terminated for neglecting to return my forms before the due date. But I'm terrified. I'm 150% terrified. Alice assured me it's all routine and I know she's right and was like ""OK, it's all routine. I don't have to worry, it doesn't mean they are terminating my benefits"" and she says ""well, there's always a *chance* but yes everyone has to do this. Just fill out your forms HONESTLY. Not 'I'm mel & I'm stubborn as Hell and I can handle this, whatever!' but 'I have insomnia and vertigo and I still can't put on my own bra and my drugs make me nauseous and I haven't shaved my legs since October because I can't hold a razor"" which was one of those ""you're 100% correct, quit knowing me so f*cking well"" moments. Still terrified.

Paul and I joined a gym again this past weekend. It was cheaper than I thought and their pool is nice and doesn't allow children so I was sold. We signed up yesterday after using our trial pass and Paul actually gives a damn about using the whole gym and improving health and such so the girl signed him up for the free personal trainer assessment. She asked me and I said ""Nope. Crippled. Just here for the pool"" but now some trainer is calling me and I know I'm going to have to either answer the phone or tell this person in person ""Hi, I have Rupus. I'm not gonna get better. I eat just fine, I've seen nutritionists. But between my disability and all the drugs to treat said disability my body resists any kind of change like weight loss and in some cases actively fights it. Please don't try to talk me into some program that's just going to make me feel like a goddamn failure for not meeting your goals. My one and only goal is to get in the pool and try to be comfortable for a while. Weight loss is not my goal. Fitness is not my goal. Please leave me alone."" Paul and I had a discussion about it at dinner after going in to get the tour/trial pass thing. I told him how hard it is to try and set any goal because I never know what I'll be capable of on any given day until I get up so any time I try to be like ""I'm going to do X 3 times a week!"" I feel like a pretty instant failure. He suggested just making the goal ""when I get out of bed and I find I have the energy, I'm going to commit to swimming that day"" which I think will work. And we touched on the whole personal trainer assumptions about my health that I knew were coming (thanks for proving me right, answering machine! LOL) and he's like ""Hello, black guy here. I know all about people making assumptions on the basis of how you look. I'm perfectly suited to understand you right now"" and of course he's right, it was just funny to hear him say. I made it through 5 laps with my little kickboard yesterday and I'm not dead today so I'm cautiously optimistic..."

"event","I've been forgetting my pills like...a lot. My Rupus meds anyway, I try to be a bit more diligent with my depression/anxiety stuff. I have this massive ""days of the week"" pill holder and usually Sundays I sit and fill it for the week with alllllll the crap I've gotta take but lately I don't know, I feel...disillusioned maybe? My mental state has been funky and I honestly wonder if I'm not going through the damn ""change"". I got my period super early, so why not go through menopause before 40 right? I could also be wrong but DAMN hormones. But back to my pill stuff, it sort of feels like when schizophrenics are like ""I feel good. I'm going to quit taking these pills..."" and all Hell breaks loose. It's like- I'm tired. I don't know what to do with myself most days, I feel like it's stupid to restrict myself so much because I feel OK but there's that (probably 100% correct) part of me that knows I'm doing this well because I have restricted myself so much. So I've become lax with my pills, maybe as a test of how I""m really doing and the answer is: not nearly as well as I want to be or think I am. Yet I'm still shirking my meds. The thought of having to sit there sorting all those pills is exhausting and I don't want to. And I don't want to have to.

Now I'm falling back apart. This past Friday my dad came down to have lunch and I had to use my cane. I had to use it to get around the house, much less leave the house and that hasn't happened in a while. And I hated that it had to happen on a day when I saw Dad because I know it scares him. I've been that fun flavor of nauseous where you are hungry but the thought of eating makes you nauseous but so does the thought of *not* eating. I'm seeing a lot of things that aren't there. I hesitate to consider it hallucinating because it's not like computer animated babies are dancing in my living room but it's still becoming frequent enough to be bothersome. It's almost exclusively peripheral vision type stuff where I think I see one of the cats but realize it's a grocery bag, I see people on the side of the road that aren't there- that kind of thing. I need to get my shit together, I need this to not be another symptom. It's hard not to resent the sh*t out of your body and I'm not sure how to stop."

"event","I&#39;ve been helping Uncle Jim with his website and he actually gave in and made a facebook page (I am his only friend, but this way he can monitor and interact on his artwork page). He calls me at least once or twice a week and I have to spend like 30 minutes walking him through something. It&#39;s really kind of adorable, but I&#39;ve been so damn exhausted lately I hate to hear the phone ring for any reason. But apparently my grandfather asked about me when he was at Uncle Jim&#39;s on Christmas and mom &amp; I about passed out.

Some history: I have not seen or spoken to my mom&#39;s father since I was two years old. Neither has she. He cheated on my grandmother and left her for another woman and wasn&#39;t discrete about it. She had no way to support herself and Uncle Jim was young enough that he still lived with her. This is how I acquired Grandma &amp; Crappa- they were mom&#39;s parent&#39;s best friends until Jack split and they stayed loyal to Grandma. After she died, they took over as my grandparents. Mom helped her fight to get alimony and half of his State Patrol pension. After she died, mom sued him. She would have inherited that money eventually but since Grandma died so soon afterward there weren&#39;t really any plans or a will in place. So she sued him, it was a precedent-setting case that&#39;s still in law books. So naturally, there&#39;s a rift there. She had my dad and grandma &amp; crappa, etc. but Uncle Jim didn&#39;t have any other family so he went to live with his dad and they had a pretty normal relationship. But even if Uncle Jim brings us up, Jack&#39;s never asked about us. I ask about Jack every so often because I know he&#39;s having health issues and I want Uncle Jim to have family he can talk to about it.

Back to the present: Uncle Jim is showing Jack new artwork on his tablet and shows him the facebook page I made him and all the people who have liked and commented and Jack asks &quot;are there any pictures of your niece on there?&quot; Who knows where that came from and I can&#39;t begin to read into that but of all the things to catch you off guard..."

"event","A week or so ago I totally borked my hip. I can&#39;t really think of a better term. I was half asleep and getting back into bed and just...rolled funny? I heard my ankle snap, then my knee, then my hip. Since I sound like rice krispies anyway I didn&#39;t think anything of it until I laid down and realized my hip really hurt. I woke up the next day and things were not good. By the end of the day I was actually Googling the symptoms of a dislocated hip. My mutant pain tolerance is so high I figured if something hurt *this* bad then something was really wrong. But I&#39;m also super stubborn and didn&#39;t want to go to the ER and have some dicknuts doctor lecture me about how my weight is probably causing the pain and sends me home with tylenol without so much as an X-ray. It&#39;s slowly feeling better and I talked to Mom and ruled out anything serious. I probably just snapped a tendon or something. Because why not. Ugh.

i switched drugs *again*. I&#39;ve gone from Rituxan infusions to Xeljanz pills and from Imuran to Arava. So far so good aside from the nausea and upper respiratory bullcrap.

Today (well, yesterday at this point. The 14th) marks 16 years since I left Stump. My least favorite day of the year and lucky for me it coincided with my hormones going cuckoo. Plus I&#39;ve got a major Lupus rash signalling a big flare, which is no surprise considering the stress surrounding this time of year. So I feel like crap mentally and physically so I&#39;m a real joy to be around, I&#39;m sure.

I did roast a chicken for the first time though so I&#39;m officially an adult. It was f*cking tasty too. So all is not lost. This yearly slog is nearly complete and I&#39;m even sort of looking forward to my Christmas nachos in my jammies watching 24 hours of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;"

And normally I would have said &quot;excuse me, I was here before you&quot; but I&#39;ve had a weird headache for like 10 days and my Lupus has decided it would be an awesome time to flare up so I didn&#39;t want to open my mouth because I knew what would come out was &quot;what, you think you can cut me off because you&#39;re older than me? Because you&#39;re a MAN? WELL I&#39;M A CRIPPLE GODDAMNIT AND I NEED THAT CHICKEN AND FOR YOU NOT TO BE A DICK. FEEL BETTER NOW? FEEL GOOOOOOOD ABOUT CUTTING IN FRONT OF A POOR DISABLED WOMAN???&quot; So I bit my tongue and concentrated on the chocolate pudding in my cart.

My hips and especially my lower back have been killing me to the point that I grimace when I straighten up and resist doing anything requiring bending or...or moving in general really. And my depression is popping back up in really weird ways and it&#39;s all getting difficult to handle. Dad gave us the leather furniture from his family room and it&#39;s crazy comfortable. They bought it at a yard sale and the guy was very tall so he had it custom made to be deeper to accomodate his legs. And he never used it. It got delivered and he decided to sell his house. James and I have been fighting over it for years but Dad &amp; Kate are getting their house ready to sell (which is seriously weird. They&#39;ve been there almost 25 years) and James hadn&#39;t found a place to move yet so we got them. Muahahahaha. And they are so comfortable it would almost make you weep and it&#39;s the only place I&#39;m comfortable sitting and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because I&#39;m flaring and it&#39;s a good place to sit or if it&#39;s such a good place to sit that my body is like &quot;f*ck everything else, give me the couch and I&#39;ll shut up&quot;

Now we&#39;re planning on going to England to meet Alice in November so of course I&#39;m worrying about money and planning and all of that crap. But I reserved a taxi tour in Manchester to see all things Smiths related so I&#39;m trying to focus on that. And pudding.</p>"

"event","Spent the weekend agonizing over a friend who I knew damn well was suicidal (he admitted as much) but he&#39;s in California so it&#39;s not as though I could hold his hand through it. Then he makes a very odd facebook post and disappears. I made sure he had my cell number and slept with my phone two inches from my head. Turns out he&#39;s living in his bus and doesn&#39;t have a phone but can tap the neighbor&#39;s wi-fi. So he got in touch Monday and things seem to be evening out for him. Honestly, I haven&#39;t seen this kid since high school. He was two years behind me and I was friends with his older brother but he was like &quot;I remember you from Kyle&#39;s parties&quot; And it was another one of those &quot;oh crap, I had forgotten all about X!&quot; Like when Sean tried to convince me I went skinny-dipping in high school with a group of people and I was like &quot;BULL. I never went skinny-dipping&quot; Then I was talking to Lynne and she was like &quot;remember the time we went skinny-dipping at Steel Lake with X &amp; Y? And we were on opposite sides of the dock but before we really got in the water that cop car went by and we freaked and jumped back in your car?&quot; and I thought &quot;OMG, that happened!&quot; To be fair, it wasn&#39;t with Sean in the group he was thinking of so at least I wasn&#39;t wrong there :)

But back to this weekend. Paul said &quot;You should be a counselor, you&#39;re good at it&quot; and I told him &quot;I AM a counselor...&quot; &quot;Well you should do it like for a job though!&quot; And I reminded him we talked about it last time I pulled a friend off the ledge (so to speak) and both he and Alice said &quot;You would be great at that, but don&#39;t!&quot; because I will lose someone and I doubt I can handle that. If I wanted to do a private practice-type thing though, you cannot bill insurance unless you have a Master&#39;s degree and there&#39;s no way in Hell I&#39;m going back to school for my MSW. Maybe it was just the BSW program I was in, but that kind of tedium is not my jam. I had my counselor&#39;s license when I worked at CSTC though, but I&#39;m pretty sure I had to state where I worked on the application so I&#39;m not sure I can get one for private practice. It&#39;s all a moot point for the moment though, I&#39;m still way too shaken up to consider anything. For crying out loud, if you&#39;re having these feelings how about you come to me before they get so bad? Ugh, my brain hurts. My heart hurts."

"event","The whole medication debacle has been taken care of, thank God. I&#39;m wondering if I should have done more of a transition back to the good stuff because WHOA. Things have been a little bumpy. The little monster that lives inside managed to get its little talons in me yesterday. Chest hurt, blood ran cold, the whole nine. I managed to focus and get my thoughts back where they belong but it wasn&#39;t easy and it gets so terrifying even though I know it will be gone soon, or at least more securely at bay. It also dawned on me that hey- I still have ovaries! So I&#39;m going to watch these little episodes a bit closer and see if they may be amplified by hormones. If so, I can at least be prepared.

This past weekend by infusion drug waved bye-bye. I was feeling a little odd; feverish, general malaise, etc. I thought maybe it could be chalked up to the whole brain med fiasco but then it was like...I felt the drain plug get pulled out and the goodness get pulled out. Not even metaphorically, I could literally feel it all draining out of me. Then I glanced at the calendar- of course it&#39;s about 4-5 weeks before my next chemo visit.

After my dad and I had our falling out however many years ago I told him I was never comfortable around her and didn&#39;t want him to take it personally that I never wanted to spend time there. I love my dad and I love my brother and want to see them often but there&#39;s Kate to deal with. She has said some horrible things to me in the past few years to the point that Paul will even speak up and tell her politely to shove it. And my dad was like &quot;why didn&#39;t you ever say anything? Why didn&#39;t you just leave if she was like that?&quot; but I told him &quot;because you&#39;re my dad and she is your wife. I don&#39;t want to hurt your feelings nor do I want to give her the satisfaction of seeing me make a scene&quot; So now unless it&#39;s a family gathering I just avoid her. Dad and I will go out to lunch or dinner, James is a grown-up now so I can see him whenever. But one of the things she&#39;s taken to bitching about over the past couple years is that she&#39;d never come to Paul &amp; my house, despite us having events there that she was invited to. We didn&#39;t entertain like dinner-party-wise there because that house just didn&#39;t lend itself to such things. So here we move into this nice big house. James has been here a number of times, Dad has been down. And it&#39;s Father&#39;s Day so I invite Dad down for a barbecue. The butcher shop nearby has Kobe steaks, so I splurged and got steak for all of us, including Katie since I had checked with James to make sure she was coming. Then today, only Dad &amp; James show up. So you know what bitch? This one is on you. You were invited, you were provided for, and you chose not to show up. It made the day far more pleasant for me. We ate fancy steak, we drank margaritas, we watched Archer and had a good time. If James gets his way and makes me follow through with my (STUPID) offer to host family Thanksgiving this year she had better show up and steer clear of me. I&#39;m done trying, even on the most pedestrian level."

"event","The pharmacy switched manufacturers of my anti-depressant/anxiety meds. Walgreen&#39;s used to do it all the damn time, which is why I switched. So I know which ones work and which ones don&#39;t. The pharmacists try and tell you &quot;it&#39;s the same medicine!&quot; and yes, the active ingredient is the same but the inactive ones aren&#39;t and the release rates vary and all of that affects the absorbtion and your body&#39;s reaction. I&#39;m really not sure why they do this. I understand they are businesses and need to be cognizent of costs and they get what their warehouse sends them. With most medications, this likely isn&#39;t an issue but damn this is people&#39;s (sometimes very FRAGILE) mental health that they are toying with. And I wish there were an option that if your prefered brand wasn&#39;t available or the cheapest that you could pay the discrepancy and keep things consistent.

Because right now my mental health is precariously balanced on the head of a pin and swaying dangerously. Thankfully I filled my prescriptions early last time so I still had some of the good pills left and have been mixing them with the sugar pills they stuck me with. Plus I knew these pills did nothing so I have that knowledge in the back of my head when things feel like they are getting out of control to try and ground myself. Stuff always sneaks through though and it can&#39;t be stopped. The other night I was crying because I couldn&#39;t feed all the raccoons. Like *ALL* the raccoons everywhere ever. But Paul knows and Alice knows so if thngs get wierd they can step in. May was a rough month for me for various reasons and I finally felt like things were settling back down. Guh.

He&#39;d done some watercolors when he was younger, spent a lot of years designing/building/painting model train layouts (he&#39;s in magazines and on tours and everything), then some photography on his vacations and now he&#39;s painting things inspired by those photos. He won the audience award at last year&#39;s art show in Ocean Shores and we have a couple of his pieces. (He gave me one last year that he made with me in mind because it reminded him of something my grandma/his mom would have hung up behind her sofa. So there&#39;s that first stab) Interest has been building so a month or so ago he asked me if I&#39;d make a website for him and run the business side. Thankfully they make easy &quot;build a website!&quot; sites, because that&#39;s not really my forte. I got it up and running over the last weekend and him not being um...well versed in tech stuff, he&#39;s been over here quite a bit checking things out and giving me the go ahead. I talked to him today about some little bugs he&#39;d noticed on the site. Then he remembered something but called my mom because he didn&#39;t want to &quot;pester&quot; me and asked *her* to give me the message. While they were talking he said &quot;Jill, I just want you to know what a cool kid you have. She&#39;s so smart and cool and can do so much.

It&#39;s such a nice compliment but it hurts all the same because he doesn&#39;t have a good relationship with his kids, or any relationship really. He&#39;ll be the first to admit he wasn&#39;t the best husband but he was a great father. When he and his wife split up, she moved back to New Hampshire with their daughter and their son stayed with him. His wife poisoned that little girl against him from day one and that was the last he heard from her. A few years later his son went back to visit one summer and never came back. It&#39;s such a crazy situation. It&#39;s like, I&#39;m glad I can help him out with his artwork but I hate thinking that it&#39;s a reminder of how shitty his kids are.

I try to get out of the house at least 3 of the 4 days Paul works each week, because fresh air & sanity & social interaction whathaveyou. Since we moved I've decided when I do go out I'm going to at least wear a bra (now that I have a couple of front-hooking ones I can manage on my own) and some lipstick (basically colored chapstick to be honest) to feel a bit more human. I've succeeded about 85% of the time and it does help put me in a better mindset. Being constantly at war with my body, it seems beneficial to have this little truce and try to take some pride in what I'm still able to do.

Rupus and pleurisy have kept me away from yoga for a while & that hurts my heart. I'm trying to remind myself that it's going to take me longer to recover from the mess that was our home-buying process & that beating myself up about it will only make things worse both mentally and physically. I miss class though and I really miss Pamela. She's so encouraging and understands my crap so well. I'm wondering if part of my lack of motivation is that the last time I made it to class (for the first time since we moved) there was a substitute teacher and now I'm a little gun shy to go and have it not be the class I'm expecting again. It was a weird hit to the routine-center in my brain.

Tuesday I'm going to get a pedicure with Tami, our mortgage unicorn. It's nice to have someone nearby. It can get lonely when it comes to little things like that since so many people are up in Seattle or further away. Alice comes by every Wednesday but it's not as though she lives down the block and I don't want to be this company-hungry friend asking her to come this far out of her way all the time after working. Saturday we're getting together with John & Alan for our first strategy session for the smiths/Morrissey show we're putting on, probably in August to time things with my drugs. So I'm getting some stuff on the horizon and that's nice since my horizon has been pretty empty for a while."

"event","Well the past few days have certainly been FUN! I had an appointment with Dr. Gorman Friday that just could not come too soon. I've been having weird back/occasional chest pain. Too high to be kidneys so I wasn't *super* worried. I talked to my friend Beth who is an RN and we came to the conclusion it was likely pleurisy (the outer lining of the lungs become inflamed, not uncommon with autoimmune diseases). When I talked to my mom the next day she suggested ice packs and ibuprofin or percocet for the pain (muscle relaxers didn't help) and I tried to get into see my primary care doctor. By this past Friday, this had been going on nearly two weeks. Well lucky me, traffic was so bad I never made it out of Tacoma. I had called Dr. Gorman and I was going to be her last appointment that day because she had to leave ASAP so there was no chance of being squished in when I managed to get there. I'm guessing that added stress turned my pressure pain into a sharp pain and I thought ""hey, I'm near an ER...I'm gonna go to there just to be sure this is what I think it is"" Well the PA that first day came in after all my labs were done and was all ""show me/tell me"" about the pain and then went ""KIDNEYS!"" despite my manymanymany assurances that I both actually knew where my kidneys were and that wasn't where the pain was AND that I had had kidney infections before but since I didn't have a fever and my urine was normal there was no reason to think it was kidneys. Paul got there not long before they took me for my cat scan. After a while the PA comes back in and says ""well the scan and your labs say it's not kidney related (NO! REALLY???) but it looks like you're awfully constipated."" ""I'm not though..."" ""Well sure, you can see it here on the scans. Now, this can happen when you get dehydrated..."" at which point Paul cuts him off and says ""she's not though, she drinks more water a day than anyone I know because she knows it's easy for her to become dehydra-"" and the PA cuts him off to say ""well then you have to look at diet. See, when you eat a diet full of meat and cheese and not enough fiber then you can get stopped up!"" and both Paul and I were like ""um...I don't think"" and he says ""well, what have you had to eat so far today?"" and I said nothing and he looks at me like I must be trying to starve the piggy pounds off and says ""WHY NOT???"" and I told him I had just woken up less than two hours before I got to the hospital ""oh, and you just *weren't hungry*?"" ""No, I normally don't eat until I've been up for a few hours otherwise my stomach gets upset"" and then he sends me home with something that is supposed to make me poop, convinced that is the root of all of my problems and tells me to come back the next day to be rechecked. I asked why, since my labs and scans came back clean and he's like ""well...just in case"" In case what? You wrote me off because I'm fat and you assumed I didn't know what I was talking about? In case it was related to one of the drugs I take that you never asked me about? At this point I wouldn't let Paul touch me because I would dissolve into tears because I was so hurt and upset. Like every doctor that came before Dr. Gorman, he wrote me off because I was fat and if I was fat I couldn't possibly know anything about my health.

Headed back for my recheck the next day and thank the good lord it wasn't the same staff. The new PA asked about all the meds I take and what made me decide to come in the day before and what the previous PA did/said and he's like ""that weird, that pain isn't near your kidneys. Why was he so insistent?"" Good question, dude. ""So...did you poop?"" Oh yeah, I was hollow inside at this point. ""And the pain didn't change?"" Nope. He said he'd rerun my labs and wanted to do a CT of my chest to rule out a PE but that he thought I likely had something called pleurisy at which I threw my hands up in triumph and Paul said ""that's what she's been saying it is the whole time"" We sat there way too long, but it turned out it was good that we did because you have to wait 24 hours between cat scans that use contrast dye and when the CT guy came to get me it had *just* been 24 hours. Scan was clear, no PE (which is something Mom, Beth, & I were glad to have ruled out) and I got to go home with a diagnosis of (surprise!) pleurisy. 

Now I'm back to my routine of ice packs and anti-inflammatories until I can get back in with Dr. Gorman but I'll call her nurse tomorrow and will likely have to do a course of steroids to try and get this under control.

Fun times, y'all. FUN. TIMES."

"event","I do not have the plague...though I&#39;m still dubious. With my luck I&#39;ll incubate until no other person alive could still muster an illness and THEN come down with it. It&#39;s pneumonia, by the way. We found out our houseguest/squatter was in the hospital for about 4 days with it. Awesome. Also, during my &quot;OHGODNONONO&quot; google-ing I realized I had walking pneumonia when we got back from Denver. Because I am fancy. Thankfully Dr. Gorman had figured it was *something* deserving of a course of antibiotics and that plus waiting it out is all you can do, which is what I did. But still, dang.

We&#39;re mostly settled here and are hitting that &quot;oh shoot, we need X&quot; phase that tends to cost more than you think. Of course, I am a cheap bastard. There&#39;s the &quot;Hey, we give a damn about this house and want to make it awesome. Let&#39;s hang up all of our artwork!&quot; part. That part requires a bunch of frames for previously un-framed stuff and of COURSE nothing we have can be a normal size that you can buy at Target or whatever so I had to buy them on Amazon and $$$. Then there&#39;s the &quot;these blinds aren&#39;t enough for our day-sleeping vampire eyes and hanging up our old curtains by clamping them to the valence rod makes us look like hillbillies&quot; &nbsp;part. So I scour the intertubes and find nice ones at Target and $$$. New bookcase and $$$. Building pantry staples back up and $$$. Replacing exterior door hardware and then replacing a door because the doorknob was set really far in on the other door but we&#39;re keying everything to work on the same key so we need to replace that whole door and $$$. Our tax refund was pretty hefty though since the house closed before the end of the year and we got to deduct ALL that shiz, so it&#39;s not like we can&#39;t afford it but I&#39;m bad at spending large-ish sums of money.

Since we moved I got a hold of Robbie to see what he wanted out of the gear he had left in the basement and to make him come carry stuff. But now I just miss being in a band again. Part of it is wanting to be back on a stage. We&#39;ve been so wrapped up in the house stuff for the last many months that I&#39;m feeling really isolated and want people to clap for me. The biggest part though I think is just wanting that band camaraderie back. I miss the jokes and practice and post-practice hang-outs. I&#39;m toying with the idea of getting a couple friends together and doing like a Smiths/Morrissey or college radio cover night just to get it out of my system."

"event","So we got a message on Paul&#39;s cell phone the other night from a friend of ours. He had been riding around on busses for days straight because he had nowhere to go. Paul went and picked him up and we parked him in our guest room. Problem is, he&#39;s sick as Hell and I&#39;m trying to be hospitable but whatever he&#39;s got could literally kill me. I&#39;m not dying from something lame like the flu, I&#39;m only 37 damnit. I called to get the power turned on at the other house though so he has a place to stay for a few weeks until the tenants move in.

Part of me is upset that I can&#39;t be more accomodating but...wacky immune system etc. The other part of me though is screaming that I cannot be his social worker nor his therapist but he&#39;s in such a bad way that it&#39;s hard to bite my tongue. It&#39;s sometimes a hard line to walk between &quot;I&#39;m chatting with a good friend and they need advice/reassurance&quot; and &quot;give me the reins, you&#39;re cocking this up and I&#39;m going to give you step-by-step instructions on how to fix it.&quot; This time though, I can see the edge of the abyss and I know I need to stay the Hell away. We&#39;re helping in the best way we are able and I&#39;m glad, but I need it out from under my nose because social work is my job and your job doesn&#39;t belong at home.

On top of all of it, he&#39;s gone very conspiracy theory/uber-hippy pothead who is trashing vaccines and pretty much all of Western medicine. And I can respect that, I&#39;ve seen Naturopaths and Acupuncturists and am open to all of that but so far all that has kept me functioning is hard-core, chemical-laden chemo. So having someone come into my house and trash the means I use to stay alive...sucks. (he wasn&#39;t attacking me or my treatment, just speaking in general but you don&#39;t eat your BLT&#39;s in someone else&#39;s Kosher household)"

Like the entire lower left quadrant of my torso. Not a clue how it could have happened. I&#39;m beginning to worry that it&#39;s due to one of the drugs, because I&#39;m super-pale and every little spot shows up on me but this is way out of hand. I&#39;m honestly freaking out a bit that my RA/Lupus might be flaring back up. My hips and knees have been aching so badly that I&#39;m having trouble sleeping and have been napping for hours every day which is really out of character for me. And my fingers are getting &quot;sticky&quot;, I&#39;ve had to pry my right hand open pretty regularly over the past week. Ugh.

We&#39;re getting close to having the house unpacked and arranged and getting things figured out. I was so excited to have good bathtubs but it seemed like we could never get the water hot enough and it like the hot water ran out on the quick side when taking showers. This weekend though I found the temp setting thing on the water heater and cranked it up so I think the problem is solved. Things stayed nice and hot when I took my shower today. And holy cow we have a kitchen table in the middle of our giant kitchen that is actually easy and enjoyable to cook in.

"event","We actually closed the day of Christmas Eve. Everyone involved (title company types) were all &quot;what a lovely Christmas gift for you!&quot; while Paul, Tami, &amp; I were thinking &quot;about f*cking time, bitches. We&#39;ve been at this since August.&quot; Seriously, four bloody months to finish this up AND now the loan comapny is trying to fudge the terms. Tami set it up so that the overall cost of the mortgage insurance was rolled into the loan itself rather than be a monthly payment, which is really in their favor because that way it&#39;s a part of the financed cost rather than something we can re-fi out of in 6 months. So even though we have keys and 90% of our stuff is here now it still doesn&#39;t seem resolved or complete. Because who would want to be done dealing with something so SUPER-FUN?!?!

I did a deeper closet purge a few days after we moved in partly because my folded stuff wasn&#39;t fitting the way I wanted and partly because it was time to get rid of some things that still fit but that I wouldn&#39;t need, like super-professional clothes. I figure if I ever need anything like that again I can build that part of my wardrobe back up with clothing people are wearing this century.

Paul has been working his ass off getting everything moved. By the time we actually got the keys any hope of getting movers was dead. James and Alice came by to be the real muscle and Mom &amp; Steve came and brought Mom&#39;s friend Patti who she&#39;s known since high school. Patti actually moved quite a bit herself and she &amp; mom helped me unpack the kitchen. While we were doing that they were reminiscing about the neighborhood (my mom grew up a few blocks away) and Patti was saying &quot;it&#39;s still so familiar! I mean Dan&#39;s (her husband) sister lives over here and so-and-so&#39;s house is further up this street and a man my mom used to see, Mr. X, lived on that corner there.&quot; and I said &quot;X? No, that&#39;s this house. That&#39;s the name of who we bought it from.&quot; Which shows you how small the world is. She immediately called her mom and we all had quite the laugh. And while the Xs left some things behind that we like (a kitchen table and entertainment center &amp; desk) they left quite a few things we don&#39;t want or need and getting rid of them while trying to arrange our own stuff is proving to be a bit of a headache, especially for Paul who is having an itchy brain over &quot;too much stuff!&quot; in the way.

So yeah. Moved, but still no closure. But at least I don&#39;t have to go downstairs to the bathroom at night :)"

Drug day was last Thursday though, and the need to be done with stairs is *very* strong. Also, the chemo is giving me all kinds of fun side effects. I just started Plaquenil (a Lupus-centric drug) and all this tummy fun time may be due to that too. After 4 years I&#39;m still nowhere near normal so now we&#39;re rechecking Lupus labs and seeing if getting a handle on the RA is giving the Lupus a way to flare up. Nothing is ever easy.

And the 14th was the 15th anniversary of leaving Stump. I wonder if I would even recognize that me. The days leading up to it were far worse than the day itself (nice to know that bit of wisdom I taught in my grief support groups is true) and I think being overwhelmed with the house &amp; Rupus may have helped me not to dwell on it as much.

"event","I finally got a hold of the bank about clearing up a credit discrepancy and it was the only thing standing in the way of full mortgage approval. They said we were in the clear &amp; they had notified the credit bureaus and were sending us a letter to that effect.

Tonight we took Alice out for fancy dinner to celebrate and stuffed ourselves like little piggies, dessert and all. Then Alice stole the check :P It was our plan to treat since she basically fronted us the money to do this until my inheritance comes but she was having none of it apparently.

So basically, once this letter comes we can ask for keys and start moving. We could be in the new place by this time next week! I want to do all the dorky things like switching the cable &amp; utilities and figuring out where the cat&#39;s dishes go and deciding where to put the trash cans.

Last weekend I went down to California for my Grandpa&#39;s funeral. I&#39;m officially all out of grandparents :/ We *thought* we&#39;d be knee-deep in moving so I went by myself, plus it turned out the funeral was Saturday not Friday so Paul wouldn&#39;t have made it back in time for work Sunday. So I, the blackest of sheep, flew down with James on Friday and drove our rental car out to the hotel. The family was of course pretty drunk when we got there but we did our duty and hung out briefly in the &quot;party&quot; room before running back to our room and ordering room service. Thankfully we had a room to ourselves and make pretty good hotel roommates which is awesome because it&#39;s another facet to our sibling-y relationship. Also, we both agree that sleep number beds are crap. Who knew a Radisson would have fancy beds but they just aren&#39;t comfortable at any number. I&#39;m not sure why James hated his but I sleep on my side and there is NO give. It&#39;s a glorified air mattress. The funeral mass was nice and Vandenburg Air Force base sent soldiers to be pall bearers at the cemetary, which was a surprise. 21 gun salute, presentation of the flag, the whole 9 yards. It was a lovely send off. For the first time in as long as I can remember all of the cousins were together &amp; the first 5 (Cindy, Gretchen, Anna, Shannon, &amp; me)...I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve all been in the same place in probably 25 years. So it was really nice to see them and catch up together. I&#39;m glad I went so I could be there for my dad but yeah the family awkwardness level was high, but I survived.

Now if we could just get moved, that would be awesome. We&#39;re dealing with the underwriter now and though our financing guy says we got a good one it&#39;s still a bit of a battle. There are a lot of hoops to jump through, but we were expecting that &amp; I&#39;d rather have them throwing out hoops now than denying us right before closing like what happened 4 years ago. I hate not knowing though and am just ready for something to HAPPEN. This suspense bites. Coupled with the weather changes, this is driving my Rupus nuts. HAPPENHAPPENHAPPEN!!!!"

"event","Mom and Steve were coming through town on my birthday and we set up an appointment to look at the house we had an offer on in Fircrest. Steve wanted to take a look at the upstairs bedroom and see how difficult it would be to put a half bath in. Alice came too since she wanted to see inside the house. Everyone liked it but wasn&#39;t super-crazy about it. The day before I took Paul to see a different house in North Tacoma that I had seen with the agent earlier in the week. It&#39;s very big and in a very nice area and kind of over my comfort zone budget-wise, but it&#39;s one level and already has a bath in the master (a FULL bath) and although it&#39;s never been updated it&#39;s been VERY well cared for. And of course we don&#39;t really care about the updated part and I have an intense love of wood paneling which is all over the family room. So I mentioned while we were in the Fircrest house that we had looked at this other one so we all headed over there and everyone FLIPPED. And everyone but me agreed we should pay whatever it took to get it. The mortgage place approved us for a very hefty amount so the only issue was what we felt comfortable with as far as monthly payments. Paul and I have never been the kind of people to live above our means or usually even AT our means and this house is going to put a toe over our means line. Granted, it may be for as little as 6 months since that&#39;s how long we have to own the property before we can refinance and by refinancing we get rid of the mortgage insurance which is what&#39;s driving the payment amount out of my comfort zone in the first place. And Paul&#39;s like &quot;I can always pick up some overtime if we need it&quot; and Alice said &quot;I&#39;ll put off buying my car if you guys need the money, we NEED this house!&quot; ( A: I don&#39;t know how Alice became so awesome. People have always assumed we&#39;re sisters or cousins and I think at this point we pretty much are sisters and B: She, Mom, and Steve have already laid claim to &quot;their&quot; rooms in the house) Paul hit the nail on the head when he told Mom I have a hard time pulling the trigger on any major purchase. I mean, I&#39;ve done the math and it may get snug but it&#39;s doable. I don&#39;t know why I get so worked up over this stuff. No one in my family does, which adds credibility to Mom&#39;s story that I was hatched in the woods.

Anyway, I got word today that our offer was accepted so I imagine I won&#39;t be sleeping much until we close :D The 5 of us went out to dinner afterwards at this super-yummy Southern food place we found with Libby &amp; Stephen on Paul&#39;s birthday then Alice declared she was putting off my birthday gift until we moved so she could get something for the house. I seriously wish I could turn off the worry center of my brain. I imagine once I get to take a bath in my new giant bathtub it will get a lot easier :)&nbsp;"

It&#39;s especially crummy during chemo time with all of the steroids pumped into me and the other drugs I take to counteract the side effects. Plus a TON of my hair has fallen out since the last drug day and I still have another one Friday. I get my hair done Saturday (I&#39;ve started seeing my mom&#39;s guy down in Olympia since she and I usually meet up after her appointment to hang out, but since mine is so thin and not growing too quickly I only go every third time or so) and I&#39;m hoping he will lie to me and say it doesn&#39;t look so bad :) Alice has been at her family reunion for the last couple of weeks and it&#39;s too hot to go to yoga so my routine is all thrown off, I still feel some serious animosity toward Nathan and that whole cluster of a situation and it all just gets amplified SO. MUCH. through the joys of solumedrol. And while this medication seems to be working the best so far, my sedimentation rate is still 25 (below 20 can be considered normal, and granted I began this journey at like 89 :/ ) and the side effects can be rough.

But on the bright side, we&#39;re much closer to a new house. And in Fircrest of all places! Fircrest is kind of the Bellevue of Tacoma, kind of the upscale suburbs. My focus had been North Tacoma but property taxes are kind of high there and while we&#39;ve found a couple places we liked a lot, the majority of what we like is in Fircrest. And it&#39;s so *quiet* there! Granted, we&#39;ll be the weird, tye-dye wearing childless Goths in the land of soccer moms and families that take their boats out on the weekend but we&#39;re OK with that :) We have an accepted offer in on one house, kind of similar to ours now in that the upstairs is a big open space but the overall house is bigger and better laid out but we&#39;d need to put in a half bath upstairs (since that&#39;s one of the main reasons we&#39;re moving) and we have to wait through a short-sale period. My concern is that it&#39;s going to be too difficult or expensive to put the bathroom in but we&#39;re going to bring a plumber along when we have the inspection done and can back out if that&#39;s the case. Or we could be outbid, so we&#39;re still looking to be safe. There&#39;s one I&#39;m really dying to see, that because it hasn&#39;t been updated since...ever, I think we can get in our price range. Plus, I love that it&#39;s not really updated because it&#39;s so 60&#39;s inside. And it&#39;s brick. AND it&#39;s all one level with a finished daylight basement. I know Paul loves the one we already have the offer in on &amp; I&#39;ve been disappointed by pictures vs. reality plenty of times but I&#39;m keeping my fingers crossed anyway.

Friday after drugs we&#39;re going to dinner with James for his birthday and Alice is back soon and it can&#39;t possibly stay this hot much longer, so hopefully I&#39;ll have an easier time combating the chemo blues after the next dose."

I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s all the Lupus though, it&#39;s the house-buying stress and the heat lately, I haven&#39;t been to yoga in pretty much forever and I&#39;m *just* getting over the plague I was coming down with before we went to Denver. Today is the first day I haven&#39;t had a throat drop in at least a month and I almost have my singing voice back. That was freaking terrifying, a couple weeks ago I went to sing along to the radio and what came out was NOT what usually comes out of my face. I was beginning to think there had been real damage done and I could not handle my body betraying the last thing I had going for me, but today it was a bit better with only a couple twinges from the hurt spot in my throat.

I really just wanted to have the house stuff decided before drug day to get me through the next 6 weeks of chemo Hell. I just wanted a closing date or SOMEthing to keep me going. We found a couple places we liked but we weren&#39;t able to come to a price that worked for everyone. I think the first house is a lost cause but that if we keep our eye on the second one they may drop the price and we can jump back on it and get it figured out. But for now we continue to look &amp; we may wind up finding one we like better. We&#39;ve been having to remind each other that we are looking for the &quot;forever&quot; house and to not compromise. With the market coming back up though I&#39;m feeling a bit of a time crunch because I don&#39;t want to get priced out of the area we want to be in but also because having to go up &amp; down the stairs to the bathroom multiple times a night is just killing me pain &amp; sleep wise. The only other solution I can think of is to drug up before bed and hope I can sleep through the pain but the drugs wear off and I don&#39;t want to be dependent on drugs to go to bed. I&#39;m very careful with how I take muscle relaxers &amp; narcotics (much to my doctor&#39;s chagrin) because I don&#39;t want them to lose effectiveness or become dependent. There are still a few days before drug day though, still time to house hunt and maybe get an offer in.

Good CRAP my knees hurt. I need to go to yoga so badly but it&#39;s hard to get motivated in this much pain and with this damn heat. Lupus, sometimes you make things very difficult."

"event","We went to Denver last month for our friend Petra&#39;s wedding. The sun/heat/elevation did awful things to me but it was all worth it for the trip. I had brought two dresses with me (I ordered one, then the place told me they didn&#39;t have it so I scrambled to find another one. Ordered a new one, original place tells me they found the dress I ordered. Thus, two dresses) After expressing my concerns over FB and texting to Libby &amp; Jessica, I decided to risk the halter strap dress for the wedding. I was worried it might be a little &quot;TITS AHOY&quot; for a wedding. Paul and Stephen and I stopped to grab a bite before heading to the ceremony and I asked them if the top was too revealing for a wedding. Stephen says to me &quot;darling, you are asking this of two heterosexual men who enjoy breasts. We are the target audience and thus not the ones to ask&quot; Ha ha, boys :P But I got them to agree that it was &quot;well, that woman looks nice and has attractive cleavage&quot; rather than &quot;that chick looks cheap with her tits hanging out&quot; But then of course upon seeing Jessica and later Libby they both said &quot;wow, that dress is awesome! And your boobs look amazing&quot; So I&#39;ve quit worrying about my boobs. Although halter straps and I don&#39;t get along very well, hurts the back of my neck. I&#39;m so glad we got to be there for the wedding though, the ceremony was perfect, plus I got to see people I don&#39;t get to see often and needed some serious hugs. AND I got to hold hands with an adorable almost-three-year-old and dance with my husband :)

Now we are currently in the process of trying to unload this house. I hate it much less now that we have an actual kitchen, but it still not our &quot;forever house&quot; and it was never meant to be but thanks to the Rupus we&#39;ve been here longer than intended. I need a house with a bathroom on the same floor as our bedroom and have always wanted to live in a particular area of Tacoma. I&#39;ve put this house up on a couple of free sites to see if I can drum up a little interest without having to pay for a listing site (our Realtor suggested selling ourselves to save us money) I&#39;ve gotten interest from a few investors which I think is the best option since they either have the time &amp; money to flip it or rent it out. Mostly I&#39;m just ready to feel settled. The Rupus is still in flux and will likely stay that way and I just need something to be positive and permanent. I can tell this latest round of drugs is wearing off and am desperate to get things accomplished while I&#39;m still feeling semi-functional. Plus house-hunting is my favorite thing EVER and I want to get to it!"

"event","Yesterday Mom &amp; Steve came up to have a look at the kitchen counter-spot and wound up...telling us we&#39;re getting a new(ish) kitchen, courtesy of their friends in Ocean Shores who are remodeling their kitchen. They were going to sell the entire set of cabinets on craigslist for $50. Normally even on CL you&#39;re looking at $500-$1000 for a kitchen&#39;s worth of cabinets. So Mom said &quot;ummmmmm,nope!&quot; and had Steve go measure and plan. Then he had a damn field day in our kitchen figuring out how he wants to set it up, checking wiring and studs. All it will cost *us* is the rest of the countertops, which even if we wind up having to replace what&#39;s already there will be a pittance compared to what we&#39;re getting in return. Paul is starting to get excited, I&#39;m still kind of giving the whole situation the side-eye like it cannot possibly be that easy. And of course the weird part of me going &quot;hey, I just spent $100 on that pantry, damnit!&quot; Having the nook out of there makes it much easier to envision rearranging things. I&#39;m trying not to go too nuts though, because even if the kitchen turns out amazing it will still be the better part of a year before we get to really move &amp; I&#39;m already cruising real estate sites :/

What&#39;s funny is that I was talking to my dad last week about our home improvement/get the heck out of Dodge plans and he said &quot;that sounds awesome, Meliss! Once you start fixing up a place though, sometimes you start to like it again&quot; and I&#39;m thinking &quot;not a problem, I never liked this place to begin with!&quot; It does make me a little nervous though, because the awful kitchen is one of the things I disliked most about this place but even a nice kitchen isn&#39;t going to trump the fact that I want to settle in our preferred neighborhood AND this house will still only have one bathroom. It is funny that 5 days after having that conversation with Dad Mom&#39;s like &quot;new kitchen!&quot;

I grilled Mom while we were out shopping if Steve was really OK doing all of this for us. He seems to think it will only take a couple days plus Paul will be on vacation during the time he wanted to do it anyway so he&#39;ll have help. Steve normally works seasonally repairing &amp; rebuilding boat motors and picks up odd jobs in the off season because he...he doesn&#39;t handle down-time well. Dude CANNOT sit still, ever. So I was curious about if he was cool with this or if Mom volun-told him it was happening so he didn&#39;t drive her nuts but she said it was all him. Apparently she makes suggestions about things they can get us or do for us around the house (for two years in a row our Christmas gift was mom buying our new front &amp; back doors and Steve installing them) and every other time he&#39;s said it&#39;s not a good idea/it would be too much work with our old house/it would wind up being too expensive/etc. but his response to these cabinets was &quot;oh boy oh boy oh boy!!!&quot; (literally. He says this.) And judging by his behavior yesterday, he may be more excited by the prospect than we are. Still the side-eye from me though. We&#39;ll see..."

"event","We have been in our current house many years longer than we thought we would be (thanks, Rupus!) and I recently kind of made the executive decision that next year we are Audi 5000. With the Rituxan appearing to work pretty well, I&#39;ve got kind of this urgency to get things done. Like &quot;I&#39;ve got a modicum of energy and brain power, let&#39;s do ALL THE THINGS!&quot; but I think it&#39;s also helping to have something tangible to focus on.

I&#39;ve never been a huge fan of this house but we had already sold our house in Lacey and homes in Tacoma in our price range were going quickly so we jumped on this, mostly because it had a functional basement for the band. There&#39;s only one bathroom (and I&#39;d prefer at least a bath &amp; a half for those moments when you get home and are rock-paper-scissor-ing on who gets in there first) and this kitchen...it is not a kitchen. It is a room with a stove and a fridge in it. There&#39;s a serious lack of both cabinet and counter space and we have to work around our portable dishwasher. Our friends Mark &amp; Schandra gave us their breakfast nook when we moved in and while it&#39;s awesome, it takes up the entire nook space. It honestly looks like it was made for the spot but it eliminates a lot of space. Plus when we moved, this neighborhood was on it&#39;s way up. Not necessarily gentrifying, but people fixing up their homes and taking pride in the neighborhood. Then the housing market crashed yaaaaaay! So time for a change.

Since we had the living room redone when I got my disability back pay that eliminated a HUGE cost in getting this house ready to go. So I figure we&#39;ll spend the spring/summer doing the rest and have a Realtor come check it out in the fall so we&#39;re ready to go around tax time next year (refund = bigger down payment. Hopefully we can at least break even on this house). Last week Alice and I changed out the wall sconces in the office and game room from cheesy tin ones to nice brushed nickel/frosted glass ones. Yesterday we fixed the wonky outlet by the kitchen sink and figured out how to fix the outdoor faucets. Today I ordered a pantry cabinet for the kitchen and put the nook up on Craigslist. Then while we were at dinner I suggested to Paul that we go look at paint chips for the kitchen because I&#39;d like to paint at least behind where the pantry will go before putting it up. So of course we came home with two gallons of paint :x We&#39;re going to have Mom&#39;s husband Steve come put an L-shaped counter top between the stove and fridge and I think all of that will &quot;fix&quot; the kitchen. Then I&#39;m going to paint the office and game room and fix the stairwell to our room where the mattress ate it on the way up then the interior will be done as far as we can tell. We need to paint the trim on the outside of the house and get the yard/flower beds looking like know something about yards and trim the trees then power-wash the porch &amp; walkways...all perfectly possible with a little help from friends/family we sucker into helping over the spring/summer.

All of this has actually helped to really put my mind at ease and give me something to work toward/look forward to. And it gives us time to prepare so we can concentrate on foreclosures and short sales to get into our prime neighborhood in a way we can afford. And of course of our our spiffing-up work means we won&#39;t be afraid of some elbow grease in the new place. So please oh please keep mostly working, Rituxan &amp; be nice to me, Rupus.

Now I just have to keep myself off of real estate search sites and falling in love with houses that in all likelihood will be gone by the time we can do anything about it :D&nbsp;"

"event","The one thing that frustrates me more than any other about being sick is at the moment...this is all I have. I don&#39;t have a work shift to think about or music stuff at the moment to take up the space in my brain. I get *this* and it&#39;s the focus of my life and not for the last time. This latest infusion has hit me like a brick and with some very chemo-esque symptoms, which makes sense since this *is* chemo. I get the drugs cancer patients get because my immune system just won&#39;t STAHHHHHHHHHHHHHP! So I&#39;ve been living on tea and soup and such for about a week. And next week, I get to do it all again.

I&#39;m still adjusting to the thought that I may not have a traditional job again, but that&#39;s kind of lead me to why I define my worth by my work. There are plenty of men and women who are not ill who are house-spouses and happy to be so. Paul and I have been together for 13 years and he&#39;s never given me any reason to think he won&#39;t support me financially and physically/mentally/etc. And if something should happen to him, Alice and I have already talked about staying together. So really, I don&#39;t need to worry about being alone. But I love working and I love helping and I want to figure out how to fit that into my life but I&#39;m trying to take things slowly and learn what is reasonable for me to undertake. Part of me wants to go right back to working with kids and mental health but more and more I think I want to continue grief work or palliative/hospice work. Bridges was the place I felt most like I was a &quot;professional&quot; and the work was the most rewarding. You are meeting people at the lowest point and helping them to process and adjust and discover a new normal. Then there&#39;s the part of me that grew up in nursing homes and knows not everyone has someone to be with them and care about them before they die and I feel like that would be a powerful thing to give people. Stuff to mull.

But for now I get to focus on the people I love. We got to go to Jes&#39; wedding this past weekend and will go to Petra&#39;s in June &amp; see more folks we love. James&#39; school load slows down in the summer so hopefully we can see him a bit more. The yoga studio moved to a gorgeous new space that&#39;s actually a little closer to me. Things *are* good, this new med seems to be helping, I just need to learn to get out of my head more. It&#39;s noisy in there."

"event","My friend Annie died a week and a half ago. It was a blood clot, caught everyone off-guard. I&#39;ve cried quite a bit about it but it&#39;s still hard to wrap my head around the fact that my friend, someone near my own age, is no longer here. There have been people that I knew from High School, etc. that have passed away but I really hadn&#39;t seen them or thought much about them *since* High School. Other than that it&#39;s been older people like grandparents or people who had long illnesses. None of us had really gotten to say goodbye to her because who could see this coming?

I wasn&#39;t as close to Annie as a lot of the Seattle crew was. Partly due to proximity and partly due to the fact that she and I seemed to have the same flavor of &quot;shy&quot; and it was difficult to be closer/know each other better. But any time we saw each other, we doubtlessly be hanging out in a corner talking about video games or music or dogs. She &amp; I spent hours in a hospital room helping a friend out in December. A few weeks ago I hooked her up with another friend of mine who did technical recruiting to try and help her secure another job. But now suddenly she&#39;s no longer. It&#39;s bewildering.

We&#39;re doing a &quot;Viking Funeral&quot; memorial for her on Friday. Though everything seems to be being organized by folks I don&#39;t really know so I&#39;ve been feeling really out of the loop but Libby said it&#39;s a common feeling for a lot of folks. Nathan orchestrated a song for her and is having her friends add vocals or instruments. I haven&#39;t heard the final mix yet, but sent him my vocals yesterday and it&#39;s turning out so beautifully. I was telling my mom about it today and she said &quot;Oh so it&#39;s like &#39;We are the World&#39; but for your friend?&quot; and I told her to me it felt more like laying flowers on a grave but instead of flowers it&#39;s tracks on a song. It was a semi-healing process but SO not fun to do.

What was more healing for me was having Libby and Stephen stop by Saturday. I needed to hug her so badly since this happened and it was so good to see them both. We talked about getting the Hell out of Dodge for a few days soon because the last few months have been rough for various reasons. We had planned on grabbing coffee or dinner but it began snowing rather earnestly and it was dark so for safety&#39;s sake they got back on the road. A little while later Paul went down to the basement to work on music but the dog decided he needed to pee RIGHTNOW. So I let him out and stood in the doorway for a minute. It was bright in that way it gets when it snows, like it&#39;s twilight all night. It was bright and quiet with everything covered in a thick, white blanket. Normally I&#39;m not a fan of snow, but in that moment it was almost peaceful. I hugged my friends, my wonderful husband was home, and for the first time in a week and a half things were almost peaceful."

But yesterday I took a nap and had nightmares the whole time about Stump trying to suffocate me repeatedly. Like, I&#39;d get away from him and start doing something else but then all of a sudden I&#39;d be back in the same spot being suffocated. I told Paul when I got home that I&#39;d had bad dreams about Stump and he said &quot;why?&quot; And I&#39;m like &quot;I don&#39;t know! Like I chose this :P&quot;

And then right before I fell asleep it hit me: December 14th is rapidly approaching. The day I left Stump. Because of the timing of the infusions it really snuck up on me this year. Yet another reason why I&#39;m not a fan of the holiday season."

"event","It&#39;s been in the twenties for far too many days. At least it&#39;s been dry though so I don&#39;t have to worry about snow. It always fails to occur to me that the weather has an effect on my Rupus. I keep trying to blame myself and figure out how to fix it but try as I might I can&#39;t control the weather...yet. It&#39;s frustrating the Hell out of me that I struggle with things like &quot;keeping my feet warm&quot; and &quot;bending my fingers&quot; and partly because I&#39;m too stubborn (proud?) to do extra things for myself. For some reason I feel guilty, like somehow it makes me weak to use an electric blanket and not because &quot;gosh, an electric blanket sure would feel nice&quot; but &quot;I CANNOT get my feet warm even with two pairs of socks and slippers and a regular blanket&quot; I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just steroid blues, but I imagine that&#39;s amplifying things. I did my second round of Rituxan and didn&#39;t have any issues, other than the fact I had to do it twice :/ Most infusions have loading doses, like you&#39;ll have one then another in two weeks then another in a month then onto your regular schedule. So I thought the two infusions I did two weeks apart in July were loading doses and then I&#39;d go in once every 4 months for another dose. NOPE, it&#39;s two doses two weeks apart every time. This wouldn&#39;t be such a big deal but it&#39;s usually at least a 5 hour process with me having to pee at least once an hour due to all the steroids and saline. It&#39;s kind of exhausting.

I also got to spend some time in a psych ward over the weekend keeping a friend company. It really made me miss working. An alarm went off and people went running by with restraints and I was halfway out of my chair before realizing &quot;Uh, I don&#39;t work here, I don&#39;t help with containments...&quot; It got me thinking that intake might be a good place for me if/when I can work again. I&#39;m not ruling out going back to CSTC but I think something with shorter interactions might be the way to go. I know there would likely be plenty of repeat patients but each day hopefully I&#39;d feel like I had an impact but not get too attached. It both has me thinking and has me longing for when my body (mostly) didn&#39;t betray the Hell out of me.

And I need to figure out some recipes that either freeze well or don&#39;t take a lot of dexterity/energy to prepare. I&#39;ve been dragging hard lately and relying on convenience food doesn&#39;t help me feel any better.&nbsp;"

"event","This Rituxan may be working; I&#39;m sick for the first time in three years. A common side effect of most Rupus drugs is &quot;upper-respiratory problems&quot; and so I&#39;ve gotten sinus-y ick a number of times but this time I actually *caught* something. So it looks like this drug may have succeeded in compromising my immune system, which was the point. But still, it&#39;s been a while and it&#39;s taking forever to get rid of and it&#39;s not like my Rupus is in remission or anything so I still have all the stiffness and fatigue from that on top of this bug. Alice called after work last Wednesday to see if I wanted coffee and if I even felt well enough for company and I&#39;m like &quot;yeah, I&#39;m getting over it. Bring on the coffee!&quot; and she says &quot;yeah see, I *want* to believe you but your baseline is way beyond what a normal person&#39;s is. Your &#39;feeling OK&#39; is most people&#39;s &#39;deathbed&#39; so are you SURE?&quot;

Which has me wondering if that&#39;s truly the case and why. At least as far as my health goes, I&#39;m stubborn as Hell. Even back when my feet were so swollen I could barely get flip-flops on I was all &quot;let&#39;s go to Costco!&quot; because especially since having to leave work I&#39;m clinging to my routines and making sure I get out of the house at least 3 out of Paul&#39;s 4 workdays. There&#39;s no way I&#39;m giving that up because I&#39;m tired or sore or swollen. Reading the RA and Lupus groups on facebook though it seems like maybe I am in the minority. I&#39;ve always had a crazy-high pain tolerance but some of these people are just so...fatalistic. And I don&#39;t know if those are just the kinds of people who need the support (meaning they don&#39;t have a good support system offline) or just like to whine or if it&#39;s just not in my personality to behave that way (to discuss such things publicly with people I don&#39;t know rather than privately with people I trust) or maybe my baseline is just unreasonable. It&#39;s confusing. Discernment has always been a problem for me.

It&#39;s a problem in other areas too, namely with Nathan at the moment. It may be another example of unreasonable baselines, but I don&#39;t know. Dealing with him has become a little infuriating. The communication from him has never been optimal but at least manageable, until recently. I&#39;ve (and a few others, by themselves or with me or whathaveyou) talked to him every which way from Sunday until I&#39;m blue in the face about things that need to change, like communication, like out of town shows that cost us time and money. When he had a day job it was both better and worse. Better in that he&#39;d reimburse Jes for airport parking, worse in that he was single and had a day job and had more disposable income (especially when he was still playing with the Pork) and didn&#39;t consider the expenses the rest of us might have playing a free show in San Francisco for example. And I&#39;d love love to be all &quot;oh, I&#39;m a musician! I just want a chance to play for people and I don&#39;t care about money, wheeeeeeeee!&quot; like Nathan and my husband and a number of other people. But I managed a band for one, so I know what it takes to run one and for two I do all the budgeting and bills for our house so I have to consider the cost/benefit analysis of things. I need to have someone come watch the critters, we have to feed ourselves when we&#39;re out of town, etc. I can&#39;t be cavalier about things. And this isn&#39;t our band, it&#39;s Nathan&#39;s. We&#39;re not emotionally invested in it like civita, we don&#39;t get any credit for what we&#39;re doing. And I understand now that he&#39;s doing this for a living. Libby and I had a chat with him about budgeting for shows, and maybe having to pick and choose members for shows that couldn&#39;t afford everyone or that everyone couldn&#39;t afford to participate in. Paul suggested in an email that he let the person putting on the show know the expenses and let them choose how much of a show they wanted/could afford but so far it&#39;s all still been a cluster. And now I&#39;m being usurped by some girl. She filled in for me at a show (which I was all for, I was still in the middle of a drug mess and just couldn&#39;t manage) but we show up to practice for the last show and...there she is. Not only did he not ask (which, it&#39;s his deal, but that would have been the polite thing to do) he didn&#39;t even tell anyone. I was totally blindsided and now I am out of things to say. I finally just gave the reigns to Paul, to either mediate or just talk to him or whatever. So again, I don&#39;t know if my baseline is unreasonable because my discernment sucks.

But tomorrow there will be coffee &amp; Alice and I will watch &quot;Supernatural&quot; with Zedd the cat puddle between us and I will do my best to not overdo things."

"event","I tried out yesterday for a local choral group. I was hella effing nervous but mostly because I hadn&#39;t really auditioned for anything since HS. Weirdly, I had a gut feeling before I even signed up to audition that I wouldn&#39;t get in and not in a &quot;I&#39;m not good enough for this, it&#39;s a lost cause&quot; way but more of a &quot;this might be cool, but I doubt they&#39;d take me&quot; way. Because it&#39;s been forever since I&#39;ve sung in that kind of setting and that&#39;s a pretty big hole in the resume for such a prestigious group. The audition itself went really well I thought. Good rapport with the director, my performance was better than I was anticipating. I still left feeling like &quot;I did really well, still don&#39;t think I&#39;m getting this though&quot;

And today I got an email confirming that though they thought I was a badass, there were many badasses for very few spots. I texted Margie to let her know and she said &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, competition this year was especially fierce!&quot; So while my audition my have earned me an A, there were probably a couple A+s that took the only soprano parts. That&#39;s the crappy part about being a soprano is that they are *everywhere*, kind of like guitar players.

So I went &quot;well damn, no spot for me&quot; on Facebook and people are flipping the Hell out. &quot;It was rigged! They don&#39;t know what they&#39;re missing! They were dropped as children! Etc., etc.&quot; Calls, texts, everything. An honestly, that made it worse. All of the &quot;Oh no! Are you OK?&quot; kind of stuff. Yeah, actually, I was fine until you all descended on me to try and make me *feel* better. *shrug* Yes, I&#39;m bummed but it&#39;s not the end of the world.

I went to yoga tonight to kind of combat it all. I haven&#39;t been in a couple weeks because it&#39;s been too damn hot for me not to feel like stir-fried death outside, much less in a warm yoga studio where the goal is to &quot;build heat&quot; and sweat. Plus my chest has been super inflamed. But I felt a serious yoga need, so off I went. I spoke up about chest opening poses when Pamela was asking for preferences and she delivered in spades. Bow pose, dancer&#39;s pose, side openers. It was a little rough but I felt good. After class Pamela made a beeline for me and said &quot;Wow, you must be feeling much better! You were amazing tonight! There was a noticeable shift in your practice, so positive.&quot; and I told her I thought that shift was probably mental. My Rupus is *maybe* 5% less obnoxious than usual so there may be slight hope for the scary new poison drug, but more than anything I just needed to mentally shove some stuff out. Stress aggravates the Rupus and I&#39;m a naturally worrier/stress-er kind of gal and tonight the focus was on the full moon and choosing new intentions and everything just kind of went *plink* and I was able to be really present. Our student teacher Heidi commented on it in the office too, that I must be feeling better and I said &quot;I think I was really just in the zone&quot; and she said &quot;yeah you were! Every time I looked over for adjustments I was like &#39;psh, she&#39;s got this!&#39; You did great modifications, it was awesome!&quot; And I told them both I was surprised because I was fully anticipating adjustments and that when things feel easy I assume I&#39;m doing it wrong and Heidi said &quot;No, dude, that means you&#39;re doing it *right*&quot;

That was a really nice way to close the book on the past month or so. We&#39;ll see if it holds up next class :)"

I&#39;ve been switched to Rituxan for my infusion drug and have had my two loading doses and didn&#39;t react at all which bodes well for my ability to receive it, now it&#39;s just a matter of whether or not it will work. My next infusion isn&#39;t until November which weirds me out a bit that I&#39;ve got to go so long but I see Dr. Gorman again in September as apparently we should see results around then so we can decide &quot;it may be working, let&#39;s give it a bit&quot;, &quot;it may be working, but let&#39;s augment it a bit with inject-able Methotrexate (oral MTX made me super sick and had no effect but since we&#39;re reaching the end of options save clinical trials, we&#39;re hoping injections will have better results)&quot;, or &quot;this is bunk, back to the drawing board.&quot; It&#39;s been about ten days since my last dose and after the steroids wore off it seemed like maybe there was a glimmer for a few days, but the &quot;heat&quot; wave we&#39;ve been having roared back yesterday and so did my symptoms. I&#39;ve also got a bit of a rash going on my face which is either a heat rash or my first honest-to-goodness Malar rash (hallmark of Lupus). And I&#39;m still having my &quot;I don&#39;t want to get hooked on these drugs/why in God&#39;s name am I resisting these drugs that make life bearable&quot; struggle. Poo.

But there have been good things. I made it back to yoga after about a month or so away and the class went way better than I was anticipating. I was telling Pamela (my teacher) after class &quot;I think I&#39;ve finally reached the point where I&#39;m honestly OK not being able to do certain things/accept limitations rather than claiming I am and actually having it bug the Hell out of me&quot; and she said &quot;that&#39;s all I want for any of my students! Yay!&quot; then went on to tell me how thrilled she is when I&#39;m in class because I&#39;m a wonderful teacher for her. She said with all I go through, to still come to class is inspiring and that she&#39;s learned some new modifications/versions of modifications by watching me that helps to make her a better teacher. I&#39;m awful with accepting compliments, but that was a pretty damn good one.

Voice lessons are also going well. Margie reminds me a lot of Lori, my high school private instructor, in the way she approaches my issues and her teaching style. For me visualization is an important learning tool and she gives great examples and knows how to get me to get it...if that makes sense. I signed up to audition for a local repertory group and my terror at auditioning for the first time in over 15 years is diminishing ever so slightly. When I joined with Opera Pacifica 8 (?)-ish years ago, I just went to the music director&#39;s house for a trial private lesson and he asked me to join the chorus about halfway through. I didn&#39;t have to audition for any of my bands because I either started them or pointed people to recordings and they asked for me. So it&#39;s a daunting task! Though Margie (who is actually the accompanist for the group) told me it was just the director in the audition and that he&#39;d be my accompanist/take me through whatever exercises which calmed me a bit knowing there wasn&#39;t going to be a panel there. A little more low-key, which is nice. I got myself a new dress for the audition in the hopes that if I *feel* like a badass I will perform like one :)

Mr. Mayden and I did make a bad, BAD choice last weekend though; a friend of ours thought it would be a cool idea to get 25 people together to buy the 25 different milkshake flavors at Sonic and everyone tries a spoonful of each flavor and then you finish the flavor you bought afterward. We each had 25 plastic spoons so there&#39;d be a fresh spoon for each person and each flavor. I had thought &quot;if you bought a milkshake and ate it with a spoon, it would totally be at least 25 spoonfuls, what could go wrong?&quot; LOTS, the answer is LOTS. For the next 36 hours or so it was revenge of the milkshakes. I don&#39;t know if it was all the different flavors or that some had gotten pretty melty in the journey around the circle but my God I felt sick &amp; I&#39;m not lactose intolerant in any way nor is Paul. So good idea in theory, not so much in practice. But it was nice to get out and see some folks I hadn&#39;t seen for a while."

"event","The past few weeks I&#39;ve been having a seriously rough time, mostly due to the fact that I&#39;ve been without meds really for over a month but partly because we&#39;ve been having surprisingly hot (for our area) weather. I&#39;ve had to take my muscle relaxer/percocet combo before bed if I&#39;m going to have any hope of sleeping, and then had to start getting up after an hour or so and taking more because the pain was just too much. I had been taking them about 30-45 minutes before going to be so it would have time to kick in, and then depending on how tired we are Paul &amp; I will chat/snuggle in bed for another 30-45 minutes and by that time the &quot;knock me out&quot; aspect has worn off and I&#39;m wired awake for most of the night. Now I take them right before we head upstairs and that seems to have taken car of things for the moment.
 
During the day though I&#39;ve been having to drug up much more frequently and it...hurts my pride I guess is the best way to put it. I grew up so independent and &quot;strong&quot; that I still feel the need to tough things out for some reason. But Paul is just...it humbles me the way he handles things. He will do anything for me whether I ask him to/think I need it or not. The other day I broke down in the car when we got home; the idea of having to get out of the car just seemed beyond my abilities. I was so angry that there are people who know how the weather will effect them and how to adjust but my disease isn&#39;t working that way and there is so much I want to do but I don&#39;t have the energy or I hurt too badly and worst of all I feel like I&#39;m a terrible wife. I can&#39;t keep the house as tidy or do the kitty box or run around and do stuff outside with him or whatever. He works all week, he shouldn&#39;t have to mop the kitchen too. But he said &quot;let&#39;s get you inside, maybe you need to take your pills?&quot; and I start to freak and protest and he says &quot;Dr. Gorman said you might need to and that is what there are there for, to help you feel better. This isn&#39;t your fault, you&#39;re not in control of what this disease is doing to your body&quot; Then he got me inside and hugged me and rubbed my back while I freaked out a little.&nbsp;I tried to tell him he&#39;s too good to me and he says &quot;I&#39;m your husband, it&#39;s my job! I take care of my wife&quot; and said it like it was beyond normal, like &quot;it&#39;s water, it&#39;s for drinking. That&#39;s it&#39;s job!&quot;

Thing is though, that&#39;s not how I&#39;m used to being treated by men. It is crazy to think the 4 years I spent with Stump can still somehow effect me 13 years into a healthy, loving relationship.but it does. Alice and I were talking about it the other day and she said &quot;Knowing you now, I cannot believe you went through all that. It seems so crazy to me.&quot; And it does to me too. With all my social work/DV knowledge and study I understand the relationship better and have come to terms with it but the differences are really staggering. During the worst flare I had while married to Stump they still didn&#39;t know what was wrong with me and were just throwing pills at me in an attempt to narrow it down. (Keep in mind at this point Stump worked part-time for UPS while I worked 3-4 jobs, though his job at least had insurance) I had a somewhat impromptu appointment due to a med reaction or something and of course Stump came with because God forbid I leave the house without him. The doctor told me I was dangerously dehydrated and that I had to stay on the medication that was causing a good amount of side effects. He told me unless I was going from my bed to the bathroom I was not to get up for any reason for at least the next three days. So we got home and I got situated in bed and about 20 minutes later Stump comes upstairs. He said &quot;I just checked the bank balance...I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll be able to pay all the bills this month and my parents can&#39;t lend us anything...can you call the temp agency and see if they have anything for you tomorrow?&quot; Yep, an hour after being told in no uncertain terms that I was not to do so much as sit up for the next three days. And somehow this still colors my behavior, still makes me feel guilty about taking painkillers or receiving disability payments or even having someone help me down the stairs. 

So now I work on appreciating what I have in my friends and my darling husband and that there are really no strings attached."

"event","The last Remicade attempt was a major fail, I didn&#39;t even bother to try and finish. So now I&#39;m without a biologic medication AGAIN and I&#39;m beginning to wonder if we&#39;re ever going to find a treatment that will get me back to semi-normal. I&#39;ve been living on muscle relaxers and painkillers pretty much all day and not in small amounts either. That proves to be a problem if I want to leave the house under my own power at all. I did get in touch with my voice teacher and find a later slot for my lessons to give my body some time to quit bitching before I need to leave so I should be able to get back to that next week. I hate that I have to be so dependent on pills to make it through the day, but also thankful that I have a doctor who is all about pain management and makes sure I have all that I need.

Last week while Paul was still on vacation we made it to yoga. My body has kept me away for weeks and it frustrates the crap out of me. I&#39;d been going to the Sunday class at 4, thinking that going that early would keep me from talking myself out of going. Now though I think I&#39;ll get back to the Tuesday/Thursday class at 7 to give me time to get going and eat a little something. Pamela was telling us that the class was now considered an intermediate class (on Tues/Thurs) but that everyone there was perfectly capable which kind of surprised me since I&#39;ve been feeling so out of it. I honestly thought she&#39;d pull me aside afterward and tell me to stick to Sundays but nope. There has been a student teacher in Pamela&#39;s classes as well and yesterday was showing us a wall-assisted way to start working toward shoulder stands. Pamela was telling folks that if they didn&#39;t want to try that it was no big deal and since there weren&#39;t many of us she was coming around helping folks out. She said to me &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure if you&#39;d feel like trying. I can tell your hands are bothering you today, how&#39;s the rest?&quot; And I thought it was cool that she picked up on it and keeps an eye on me; I feel lucky every time I go to class that I found that studio. I was getting the hang of the shoulder-stand trick, more than I thought I would. It will be a while before I can do it all the way or unassisted but it&#39;s a start. After class the student teacher was talking about how weird it was to just &quot;observe&quot; a class so her instructor told her to participate when she could then but she was like &quot;but now it&#39;s super-hard trying to participate, observe, take notes, and do adjustments! Of course no one in this class really needs adjustments, but still!&quot; And that was kind of nice to hear, considering I still feel like a total flounder most classes. I&#39;m thinking about asking Pamela if she&#39;d do a quick class or seminar or something for Paul &amp; I to help us come up with a daily routine we can do at home. I think I need a more cushy mat though. I put mine on top of one of the studio mates at class but my knees still get super-smashed."

"event","The surreal-ality of my life occasionally gets out of hand.

My second Remicade infusion did not go well. One tiny hive, like last time, but then it just felt like my chest was in a vice to the point where I was freaking out a bit. We had to stop again, load up on antihistamines and steroids and try the inhaler a couple times. No luck, so I had to do nebulizer treatments. Every respiratory treatment tastes like butt, how have they not fixed this yet? We finally got out of there around 4:30 and had to stop and see the allergist on the way out. He thinks he&#39;s pinpointed where in the protocol the reaction sets in and that he can modify it next time so this doesn&#39;t happen again. But if I react AT ALL like I did this last time- I quit. It&#39;s freaking terrifying and for the next 5 days at least my body was recovering and so far it hasn&#39;t improved my symptoms. I&#39;m so exhausted from dealing with this.

Then this past Thursday after frantic phone calls from Nathan (&quot;You guys knew we were practicing today right? Did I not tell everyone? I told you though, right? You can still practice though right? Can you come here? PLEASE COME HERE&quot; I&#39;m paraphrasing what I heard from 6 feet away from Paul while he was on the phone) we headed up to Seattle. While driving up the hella steep hill of James street the Volvo&#39;s engine says &quot;nah, fuck you guys&quot; and cuts out. I was *just* barely able to wrench the wheel over (ow my hands, power steering was gone, it was not awesome) into a gas station driveway. Thank God no one was coming in the other lanes while I was frantically trying to get into said driveway. We pushed it into a parking spot and popped the hood but nothing seemed amiss. Then I noticed a splash mark and some coolant on the ground so I thought maybe we blew a hose. I called my dad and he said he&#39;d be there in a bit to help out &amp; I also texted my friend Scott who I remembered mentioning a mechanic that would come to you to see if I could get that number (they never called us back, BTW. Not good business, folks!). Eventually Dad &amp; James got there and looked the car over. We jacked it up and took the wheel off to scoot under the car and hopefully see the blown hose but everything looked normal aside from the small amount of coolant. That was about all we could do sitting at a gas station so Dad (bless him) called AAA to have it towed and they said the truck would be there within an hour. Not long after this we were approached by a semi-drunk gentleman asking if we had a lighter, which we didn&#39;t. So he decided he&#39;d tell us a couple jokes because he thought we were cool. Then he began performing a snippet from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, then decided he&#39;d sing to us. Then he asked us what movie we&#39;d want to be in if we could be in any movie. Then he recited a poem for us he wrote after Obama was elected the first time, which wasn&#39;t bad really. Then more singing, and trying to get me to sing with him, then telling everyone that the best performers were always very shy offstage. Then more jokes and Shakespeare and singing and then he recited a poem he said he wrote for his sister who I reminded him of. It was about how she marched to the beat of her own drum and she enchanted everyone around her and she never knew how important she was to everyone. He looked me in the eye and said &quot;You don&#39;t know it either, but everyone needs you.&quot; I told him yeah, I was a social worker, it was my job to be needed &amp; he said &quot;I know, I could see it in your eyes, but that&#39;s not what I mean.&quot; Then more songs! And wondering what point in history we wanted to travel back to and so on until the tow truck FINALLY showed up half an hour late. So we bid our drunken companion good night and followed the tow truck to the garage. Dad said &quot;at first I was like &#39;OK buddy, you can go&#39; but then I thought &#39;I hate waiting more than anything and this guy is at least entertaining&#39; so it wasn&#39;t too bad!&quot; James said &quot;Yeaaaaaah, I knew as soon as he asked for a light this dude wasn&#39;t going to leave&quot; and we all laughed at how strange life can be and eventually made our way back home. I left the garage a voicemail explaining the situation about the Volvo that magically appeared in their lot overnight and they called me the next day around noon to let me know the timing belt had snapped and with this model of engine that pretty much equaled us being screwed. It would have been more than the car was worth to fix it but he told me not to sweat it, to take the weekend to figure out what we wanted to do and to give him a call Monday.

My brother, who I&#39;m pretty sure is running for sainthood, came down to pick me up Monday (yesterday) so I could go clean out the Volvo, settle up with the shop, and hopefully sell it for more than a scrap yard would give me. Not 5 miles up the freeway James says &quot;Wait, did we hit something? Something&#39;s wrong with the wheel I thinOH FUCK!&quot; and slams on the brakes (&quot;wow, it&#39;s really hard to stop with no tires!&quot; LOL) just in time to see the left front wheel roll ahead of the car, turn right and roll across 4 1/2 lanes of heavy traffic to land in the grass. It was something that could not happen again if you planned it- the speed it was rolling and the direction, no one had to swerve or hit their brakes. It just danced its&#39; way over. After we caught our breath and burst out laughing for a minute, because how can you not laugh at your car breaking while driving to retrieve your broken car, we got out in the record-breaking 87 degree heat to put the spare on. What was weird was that the sidewalls of the tire were still attached to the rim, it was just the tread in the middle that came off still in a circle and rolled away. So we finally make it up to the shop and I show the guy the previous owner&#39;s service records showing the timing belt was changed at 140K (the car was currently at 172K) and he said &quot;huh, I&#39;ll be damned. Looks like these folks got taken for a ride though.&quot; I hate when people assume I don&#39;t know my way around a car or what maintenance needs to be done at certain times. So I was feeling triumphant and vindicated when I asked the guy what I owed him and he said &quot;Nah. Nothing. Don&#39;t worry about it&quot; And I said &quot;But...you diagnosed it, you let it sit here for like 4 days. I have to give you SOMEthing!&quot; but he says &quot;Nah, it really wasn&#39;t a hassle and I don&#39;t want to kick anyone when they&#39;re down&quot; So that dude is awesome. I had a couple guys from Craigslist come to check the car out. I put it up there for $750, wanting to get a least $500 out of it so we could have the timing belt in Paul&#39;s car done since I&#39;m OMG paranoid about it now. So the second guy, who showed up over two hours late somehow didn&#39;t understand I was up from Tacoma (despite my saying it in the ad, and in my e-mail response...and by text) and that I really wanted to get this wrapped up tonight. He said if the first guy didn&#39;t buy it that he&#39;d come to Tacoma in the morning to pay me and get the title. I texted the first guy, telling him the second guy wasn&#39;t sure he could make it happen tonight and what was his offer. He comes back with $400. I told him no, that the second guy would give me $500 in the morning. If he wanted it tonight he&#39;d have to match it. He came back with $450. I told him no, that I needed at least $500 for a down payment on another car and he bit. Said he&#39;d be there in an hour and a half since he had to go pick up his trailer. I told him fine, we were going to dinner. As it happened Dad &amp; Kate were at Daniel&#39;s on Lake Union with my uncle Rob up from California. So James told him we were on the way because he wanted to switch cars before taking me back home (I don&#39;t blame him, that was freaking traumatic) and to order us a couple appetizers and drinks. I asked for the largest vodka cran they could legally sell me. We get there, everyone is already 5 sheets to the wind, and relate the events of the day. I&#39;m already a bit heat sick from the day and all we&#39;d had to eat all day was an order of chicken satay we split at a Thai place next to the garage while waiting for the late dude. Katie ordered some truly awful appetizers (fried artichoke hearts and an icky shrimp dish) so we only picked at them. No sooner had our drinks come than the guy texts me saying he&#39;s 20 minutes out. I tell him tough shit, we went to dinner and would be at least 30 minutes. So I pound about 4 shots of vodka on a heat sick, mostly empty stomach and off we go. We finally get things squared away and get back in the van and James says &quot;Seriously, fuck this day. We&#39;re by Dick&#39;s, right? I need a burger. Siri, find me Dick&#39;s&quot; I just dissolved in a puddle of hysterical laughter. All of this insane, surreal bull crap from the last couple weeks just hits my heat-addled kinda drunkish brain and here&#39;s my brother screaming at his phone to find him dicks. &quot;No, not a guy named Dick damnit!&quot; &quot;try Dick&#39;s drive-in?&quot; &quot;There are 4 drive in movies theaters...&quot; &quot;NO! Not movies, food. FOOOOOOOOD!&quot; &quot;Here are 12 restaurants fairly close to you&quot; &quot;NO! DICK&#39;S BURGERS! BURGERS DAMNIT SIRI...JUST...FUCK!!! AUUUUUUGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!&quot; I&#39;m in tears at this point from laughing and tell him &quot;you&#39;re holding the internet dude, just google it.&quot; We finally got our food and made it back to Tacoma. What should have taken about 3 hours took over 8. Like my infusions! LOL James leaves for home swearing he&#39;s going to go find his tire on the way home. I tell him it was right by the weigh station sign &amp; to park there for the light and to text me if he found it and low and behold he did!

Today between the heat and the stress of yesterday I pretty much can&#39;t move. I&#39;ve been swollen and stiff and sore, drinking copious amounts of water and searching the internet for another car. In the mail I got a sappy card from my mother about how even though times are rough she believes in me and yadda yadda yadda. I called her and said &quot;What, they didn&#39;t have an &quot;I&#39;m sorry the universe is taking a giant dump on your head&quot; card and this was the next best one?&quot; and she&#39;s like &quot;No, I bought this like a week ago before all of this! LOL&quot; So I relayed the events to her and she says &quot;you, who cannot grip anything, got out in the direct sun to help change a tire?&quot; &quot;Moral support! I helped...ish&quot; and then &quot;so wait, after all that time in the heat and no food and stress you still had the wherewithall to negotiate a higher price for your car? Good Lord!&quot;

One bright spot was last Saturday Ann, who was up in Seattle for a conference and to deposit a Daniel for visiting texted me saying &quot;I&#39;m on my way back, want some company?&quot; So we went and got some coffee and just relaxed and chatted for a while. It was fabulous."

"event","Last month when I saw Dr. Gorman she broached the subject of trying to desensitize me to Remicade, the biologic I had such nasty reactions to about a year and a half ago. All the med changes I&#39;ve tried since that one haven&#39;t been &nbsp;as successful and this last one in particular is actually actively making my disease worse. I&#39;m a pro at that kind of thing, I managed to develop eczema while on a medication for Rupus that is also used...to treat eczema. She has worked with an allergist who developed a protocol for people sensitive to Remicade that had worked with patients of hers before but of course left the decision to me. Because the reactions I had were so severe we felt like trying a different med at the time would be a wiser choice than going straight into this protocol; if we could find something as effective that didn&#39;t try to kill me that would be preferable :) But now we&#39;re at the point where trying the protocol is the smarter (?) choice, there are still other biologics I could try but they are newer and don&#39;t have the track record or&nbsp;searchable&nbsp;history that she can look to whereas Remicade has been around (and effective for me) for a number of years. So I met with the allergist and figured it was time to give it a shot, although I had to be there at 8 in the morning :/ So last Friday Paul &amp; I packed up many hour&#39;s worth of things to keep us busy and headed to the infusion center (after first seeing the allergist again so he could pre-medicate me with steroids and benadryl). Natalie was my nurse (YAY) so I felt better just getting in the chair. She&#39;s my favorite there, has always been the best at starting my IV and checking in with me and since she had to come check my vitals every 15 mins that day it was really comforting to have her there. I got all hooked up to my saline drip and the allergist came by to make sure I was settled and to explain the protocol. The full Remicade dose is 600mg and we started with 1mg mixed with saline in a syringe and pushed into my IV. 15 minutes later I had my BP checked and did a &quot;puff test&quot; to make sure I was moving air well, then we moved to 5mg/saline syringe with the same 15 minute check. After syringe 3 I developed one little hive, so we held off a couple minutes and drew a line around the hive so we could measure it. After syringe 4 my chest began to feel tight. I wasn&#39;t wheezing and my BP was OK but we loaded some more benadryl and the allergist had me take a couple puffs off an asthma inhaler and waited about 20 mins before hanging the IV bag to continue. It was very slow going, about 6 hours (a little over twice what it would normally take) and with all that saline I had to get up and pee at just about every 15 minute BP/puff check. SO glad I had her put the IV in my left arm. Natalie said normally the next dose (which will be in 2 weeks) would skip the first couple syringes but since I reacted to such a small amount the allergist may choose to stick with the same schedule.

I&#39;ve been both nervous that it wouldn&#39;t work and nervous that it would. It&#39;s been a year and a half since I&#39;ve been on it and I remember it working VERY well, but the disease has also had 18 months to simmer and take root. Plus, it&#39;s not like when you&#39;re at the eye doctor and they flip the two lenses going &quot;is number one better, or number two?&quot;. I don&#39;t really remember how it felt or how long it would take to work IF it was even still effective, but I was also afraid to be hopeful both because of the reactions and the fact that it&#39;s been so hard finding a good treatment for me. Yet if it DID work...then what? The past few years have been such a struggle and I was just beginning to adjust to limitations and being used to being on disability and such. So if it did work, should I go back to work? Would people even hire me with my health issues? What if I was hired and three months later had a big flare and had to quit? But Paul said &quot;don&#39;t even worry about it, you&#39;re still getting disability. I say before even thinking about jobs or whatever- give it a year. Then you&#39;ll know how you&#39;re handling things and what you feel capable of&quot; which is a good point but still difficult for me to swallow. Maybe it&#39;s because my mom was a single mom and I&#39;ve been so independent from such an early age that I feel like if I&#39;m not working I&#39;m being lazy somehow, even if I&#39;m not physically able. After talking to mom today she agreed with what Paul thought but also added &quot;the past few years HAVE been so rough with surgeries and Rupus and leaving work...if the Remicade does work- take that year to enjoy yourself! Spend a year feeling GOOD.&quot;

Even before we started desensitization I had been thinking about things I can do to feel like I&#39;m doing *something*. I can always volunteer, I have my yoga classes that I enjoy so much and would love to be able to go to more and there&#39;s the possibility of really using my voice more. About a month ago I had a trial lesson with a private voice teacher in the area, and we didn&#39;t really click. I have a hard time even putting my finger on what it was that didn&#39;t work for me, I think a lot of it was just her approach that differed a lot from what I&#39;m used to, but leaving the lesson...I didn&#39;t have that same joy I had when I usually left lessons, that same burning in my tummy from doing breath work. I let her know when I was there that I enjoyed my time but was reluctant to make a commitment after only meeting with one person and the last time I&#39;d done that it didn&#39;t work out well. She told me she had other names but seemed dismissive (maybe, I&#39;m not positive. This woman was so hard to read) of the other woman I had been referred to. I e-mailed her when I got home to thank her again and ask for those names she suggested and the e-mail I got back seemed like a kiss-off. I decided to hold off on calling anyone on her list until I had followed up with the other woman I had been in contact with, although one of the names was a woman who was an adjudicator at my Junior year competition. She judged my German piece! LOL, small world. But today I was able to meet up with the other teacher and I felt more comfortable with her right away. She said she mainly teaches piano but had also studied voice and enjoyed having a few voice students. She was glad to hear I wanted to get back into choral singing as well once I felt like I had shaken the rust off. We did a little vocalizing and she was surprised at the quality of my upper register. Typically when people have been away from studies things seem to slip down and your lower register tends to be stronger, but I&#39;m quite the opposite and I&#39;m guessing the work I do in Nathan&#39;s project is responsible for that. Building my lower register back up and bringing my breath support back to it&#39;s fighting weight so to speak is my overall goal getting back into lessons. Plus, it&#39;s something I&#39;ve always enjoyed and it&#39;s a way I can use my body without the Rupus really being a factor. I told her I felt quite good with her and wanted to schedule an actual lesson. She reminds me a lot of my high school private teacher whom I loved, both personality-wise and her teaching style. It feels like a very satisfying connection so far. We were both excited that we wanted to work with each other and I&#39;m starting next week. But best of all, as I drove home I felt like I&#39;d been punched in the gut! The exact feeling I was looking for. I&#39;m glad I decided to go this direction. The first woman was good, but I don&#39;t think I would have enjoyed myself. I don&#39;t need to work at that level, you know? Like if I had an important audition and not a lot of time to prepare she could whip me into shape but I&#39;m going to build a better foundation with the teacher I met today, if that makes sense. I imagine my dancer friends could relate.

But now I&#39;m excited. I have something to look forward to every week in addition to yoga and have a purpose to get out of the house. It also makes me really want to start work on the cover project, like I&#39;ve gotten the validation I needed from an objective observer."

"event","Well done, Morrissey. You&#39;ve pulled me out of a funk I&#39;ve been doing quite well denying. I&#39;ve let my voice take a backseat for a long time. Not that I haven&#39;t used it but it hasn&#39;t been my focus like it had been in school. I really need to step up and say &quot;you know what? I&#39;m awesome and you&#39;re going to know it.&quot; I downplay it a lot, mostly under the guise of being humble or modest but I can be humble about what I have and still be proud of it and put it out there. If this is some gift, some God-given talent or something then it&#39;s OK to use it. I&#39;ve been treating it like china that you look at and don&#39;t use but I think it&#39;s more like a shirt and I&#39;m going to wear it. In civita I felt OK about what I was doing, I could put up some bravado about what a badass I was but I did that band because I wanted to do something with my husband and my friends and I never really did it for me. Same with Nathan&#39;s project. He&#39;s my friend and he asked for my help and I gave it to him. I&#39;m not upset that I did either of these things but it never gave me the same joy I used to get from using my voice. Even when I first started singing, it was just something I did because people told me I was good at it so why not keep doing something you&#39;re good at? Now I look back at some of the arias I did and understand the emotion that goes into them and the power of the music. I won a lot of awards, received a lot of accolades, and accomplished a lot. It is OK for me to be happy about this. If other people don&#39;t feel this way, f*ck &#39;em. I spend so much time living and doing for others (not that I resent my servants heart or the work I do/help I give) and not letting myself feel the feels or focus on myself. The mighty RuPaul says &quot;what other people think of me is none of my business&quot; and I think I&#39;m starting to understand that on the deeper level. If I shave my head or wear unusual clothes or cover myself in tattoos- those are things I do for me. My husband and my friends will still love me, they&#39;ll support me. If someone giggles on the street that&#39;s two seconds of my life and I&#39;ll probably never see them again. And if they do go home and tell people &quot;OMG I saw the weirdest lady on the street!&quot; well hey, they&#39;re still talking about me. Either because I&#39;m awesome or because they are unhappy with who/where they are and that is their deal. Haters gonna hate. And most of that hate will come from jealousy or from frustration about who THEY are and seeing/hearing me calls their attention to that. At least that&#39;s why I hate on people :) Unless they are assholes, then I hate them because they are assholes but also feel bad for them. Hopefully no one thinks I&#39;m an asshole or that someone close to me will call me out if I&#39;m behaving like that.

AN. Y. WAY. back to the task at hand. I&#39;m going to make some records. They are going to be full of cover songs. Songs I like, songs that mean something to me, songs that would just be fun. One record will be various things and the other record will be all Smiths/Morrissey stuff. I will call that one &quot;Yes, I am trying to make you cry&quot; :D I&#39;ve been wrangling musical friends of mine and calling in favors to make this happen. Paul has started on a couple and he&#39;s on vacation soon so we can work on some things in earnest. I&#39;m thinking they will go up on BandCamp as streaming only/not downloadable at first. I was looking at licensing music the other day and it looks like it might not be as cost prohibitive as I&#39;d originally thought. So now I&#39;m thinking I might do a kickstarter to cover the fees and do a small run of both albums and then make the songs available for download. Maybe put some bonus tracks on the physical albums only. I imagine it will take a few months before it gets that &nbsp;far but I&#39;m finally excited to do something. With my voice. For ME. 

And I will totally take requests/suggestions. Something you want to hear? Is there a song you like but always thought it would be cool acoustic or with female vocals or a different tempo/style/whathaveyou? BRING IT!"

"event","Last night was the night I&#39;d been waiting TWENTY years (and six months, since it had to be rescheduled) for- I finally got to see Morrissey live! Oh God, he is so pretty and sounded perfect. I managed to score 11th row tickets, which at the Moore is nice &amp; close, and was on the aisle so I&#39;d have room to fall down when I first saw him in the flesh. I&#39;d only been to this venue once before and was on the balcony so I couldn&#39;t remember if they allowed people to smoosh against the stage but there were people milling around there and security didn&#39;t seem to mind. I was cool at my spot until he came out on stage, then I got a little antsy (and screamed) but then he spoke and I turned to Paul and said &quot;BYE!&quot; and booked it up there with my cane. Through the set I worked my way up to only two people from the stage. He would occasionally reach out into the crowd and I was like &quot;oh yes, I need to be a part of that.&quot; Then during &quot;Let Me Kiss You&quot; he ripped his shirt open (and I SCREAMED) and he threw it right to where I was first standing! DAMNIT! And after that song he went and put another shirt on (DAMNIT!) but during the melee that ensued over his shirt the security guy had to go handle it so I got shoved to the stage so I was RIGHT THERE! He reached past me but my wrist brushed his arm when he was pulling away and he caught my eye and smiled. Eye contact and a smile from my teenage obsession. I&#39;m pretty sure it killed me and I&#39;m typing this post from the beyond. Two songs later it was over so I made my way back to Paul and my seat and he was like &quot;awww, you&#39;re all misty!&quot; We parked right behind the theater so we loitered for a bit in the hopes that he&#39;d come out. We were chatting with a guy and I told him it was my first show and that I&#39;d been trying for YEARS to see him live and was super-bummed that he threw his shirt to where I WAS standing. And he said &quot;Yeah, your seats were right in front of mine! Well done working your way to the front, I couldn&#39;t get that far but I did get caught in the fight over his shirt. I got a piece but it&#39;s not huge. You know, I saw him for the first time at this theater in 1995, had similar seats too. The person that caught his shirt got the whole thing and afterward I was telling them how jealous I was and that it was my first show and they ripped a piece off for me. I still have it tucked away in a ziploc bag.&quot; and he took out the piece of shirt he grabbed and said &quot;I didn&#39;t get a big piece tonight, but it&#39;s your first show, so here&quot; and he ripped his piece in half and gave it to me. Morrissey smells amazing,BTW. So of course I was misty all the way home and sniffing my little scrap of shirt. Which is now safe in its own ziploc.

Today has been so bittersweet. The thing I&#39;ve wanted for so long finally happened so I&#39;ve cried a few times today, because I&#39;m so happy it happened and so sad that it&#39;s over. SO amazing, SO thankful. Now it&#39;s time to start figuring out how to actually meet him. Paul and I are like one degree away from so many folks more famous than we are (LOL) that there must be someone that can make this happen. He will love me, and now that I&#39;ve finally been to a show I might be able to speak coherent sentences to him. So come on Universe, you&#39;ve given me Rupus so how about balancing the scales? :)"

"event","Jeez, I don&#39;t even know where to start. I was talking to Alice last week about, shall we say, less than genuine people? Sort of in the vein of &quot;friends that you don&#39;t hear from unless they need something&quot; except these people may not even be your friend/have made it to &quot;friend&quot; status. It&#39;s something I experience more than I&#39;d like to. I&#39;m a nice person (though people often think I&#39;m stuck up when they first meet me, likely because I can be shy) and I prefer to be nice to other people until they give me a reason not to be. And it&#39;s those reasons that usually cut the deepest. It happens every so often with Paul; there will be a friend or acquaintance of his that is all sweetness and light when I&#39;m around or about me when he&#39;s around but otherwise they don&#39;t know me from Adam. It&#39;s my theory that they think they have to act as though they like me so they can still hang out with him or get him to do things for them. He&#39;ll say &quot;Oh, so-and-so says to go check out the whatever they posted on LJ/MySpace/Facebook/etc.&quot; and I say we&#39;re not on each other&#39;s list and he&#39;s like &quot;go friend them!&#39; and I&#39;m like &quot;if they want me to see something so badly, why don&#39;t they friend me?&quot; There&#39;s another person that will gush and gush about me to him and say they want to hang out with me or do songs with me or whatever and he says &quot;you should totally get a hold of them!&quot; Yes, perhaps I should get a hold of them and express my sympathies that they have phones and computers that can only receive messages, the poor dears. How rough it must be on them to not be able to reach out to people. This person has also not voluntarily spoken more than 3 sentences to me since I&#39;ve known them. People who want to be invited in on whatever thing we plan: trips, parties, game nights, gatherings at restaurants yet somehow can&#39;t manage to plan these things on their own? I like being invited to things too, folks. It strikes me that these people don&#39;t really want to be my friend but for some reason want me to be theirs, like saying mel is their friend somehow makes them cool? A friend of mine down in Oregon texted me once to say that an ex of hers was going to be playing a show up here and he wanted her to &quot;ask mel if she&#39;ll go, because she knows all the cool people and maybe she can bring them so the cool people will be at my show!&quot; We both laughed about this but it kind of stung: ask mel, she&#39;s low enough on the totem pole? I know the cool people but I&#39;m not one of them, I&#39;m their mascot? I just don&#39;t get it.

But the kicker is this: Bobby, our mechanic? The one who I&#39;ve given 97 chances to pay us back, who I&#39;ve been so patient and lenient and understanding with, the one who I listened to for 3 hours in the middle of the night while he bemoaned his wife cheating on him? Now we have to sue him. He said two weeks ago that he had at least enough to pay the tow company fee we have already paid, (he&#39;s had our car for a year, mind you and it was towed in DECEMBER after someone at his shop messed up) and yet he cannot manage to get it to us. He had to go out of town, it was his kid&#39;s birthday, he was super-busy, one of his kids was sick and his wife had to work so he was stuck at home, etc. I tell him Paul was free Thursday and Saturday last weekend and the three of us needed to sit down and agree on how much he owed us and how/when it would be paid back to us. Thursday we don&#39;t hear from him. Friday he tells me he&#39;s at the hospital with his wife &quot;getting the date-rape thing checked out&quot; Ten days after the fact, for one. For two, is it really date rape when she admitted to you it was consensual and told you she didn&#39;t care if you caught her? But OK, whatever dude. Saturday, I tell him I&#39;d talked to my dad the day before (for a separate reason, he just happened to ask about the Bobby situation), he thinks I&#39;m nuts for being as forgiving as I am with Bobby and that I&#39;m beginning to agree with him. He needs to get a payment to us today or I turn it over to my lawyer Dad who will not be nice about it and who will charge a Hell of a lot more than we were asking for. He tells me they are on his way to see his family and let them know what happened to his wife. Right, because that if I were sexually assaulted my first thought would be to go tell my in-laws. I tell him our house is on the way, he can drop it in our mailbox. That I don&#39;t care how much it is, but that it&#39;s a good-faith effort to show us he&#39;s serious. He tells me he has to focus on his family right now, that he doesn&#39;t want to do anything to stress his wife out, she doesn&#39;t want to be away from him. I ask him what would be more stressful, stopping at the ATM or a lawsuit? I even offered to meet him AT the ATM. He tells me they are already way out of town. Huh, cause four texts ago you told me you were getting ready to leave. I told him it hurt my feelings that I have given him so many opportunities to make this right and that he ignored every one. There was always some reason, some excuse and that I wanted an absolute YES or NO that he would come by that day with a payment because I wanted to know in my heart of hearts that I exhausted every option with him, so that my conscience would be clean when I told my dad to get all legal on his butt. Then he has the nerve to tell me that he never thought I&#39;d say something like that to him. YOU DO NOT GET TO MAKE ME FEEL BAD ABOUT *YOU* SCREWING UP! I have been so upset and stressed so of course my Rupus is running rampant and I feel like sh*t physically in addition to mentally.

So this is what I get for being nice. People always assume I&#39;m such a bitch because I&#39;m blunt, but I&#39;m only blunt when you give me no other option (or when you ask me for my honest opinion. I do not play). No one sees me crying on my husband&#39;s shoulder after being kicked in the mud, wondering why people can never be as nice or courteous or understanding to me as I am to them. I do my best to never say anything behind someone&#39;s back that I wouldn&#39;t say to their face. Even on LJ I don&#39;t name names because I don&#39;t want to color anyone&#39;s impression of people they might know. I don&#39;t hit the goal of 100% on that because I&#39;m human but I TRY. And this is where it gets me."

"event","I&#39;m really not sure what it is, maybe I have a kind face or whatever but why does everyone I come into contact with feel the need to get all TMI with me? It seems so crazypants that a disabled social worker that worked at a children&#39;s mental hospital and a techie/airline dude that happen to traveling musicians etc. are the &quot;normal/stable&quot; ones in our social circles. Not that I mind when people come to me with stuff, it&#39;s just when it veers into &quot;what the immeasurable F*CK?&quot; territory.

Example (that got me on this topic): We have a mechanic, Bobby, that we have been taking our vehicles to for the last 5-6 years. At the time he was doing stuff out of his house in addition to his regular job so he could cover the costs of adopting their daughter. He was doing such good business that he was able to leave his job and get shop space to do this full-time. So we&#39;ve known him for a while. He can be a little slow to finish your stuff because he&#39;s so busy but he&#39;s a god guy and his prices are good and he does great work. So in this last 5-6 years we&#39;ve become if not quite friends then at least friendly acquaintances. When Steve the Camry started having electrical problems last year we were in pretty regular contact about progress and all that. After we got to the point where we couldn&#39;t be without two cars again and Steve had been taken apart &amp; reassembled numerous times by numerous people Bobby said he&#39;d hang on to Steve as a project if it was alright with us (rather than selling him for scrap) and if he ever figured it out we&#39;d figure out where to go from there. So we hadn&#39;t talked in a few months until we got a notice in the mail that Steve had been towed. Which is odd in itself since he didn&#39;t run...but apparently some friend of his partner&#39;s had moved some cars around and parked a few where he wasn&#39;t supposed to. So longish story shortish, Bobby owes us some money. We know he&#39;s not flush with cash so we&#39;re patient but I texted him the other day after we failed to get a payment from him. It took a couple days to hear back from him but yesterday he responded saying he was having some issues at home and could he please call me in a few hours. Sure dude, whatever. I figured I&#39;d have to get a hold of him in a couple days but then my phone actually rings and so begins one of the most surreal experiences in recent memory. In nearly three hours on the phone, I now know all the intimate details of my mechanics sex life with his wife. Yeah. Apparently she&#39;s been running around on him. At first she claimed this guy took advantage of her, she was drunk and all that but the story kept unfolding and this wasn&#39;t an isolated incident and she was a willing participant. Like I wasn&#39;t uncomfortable enough already, he recounted the last 10 or so years and she didn&#39;t treat him well. Some of the things he was saying began to sound familiar, both from my first marriage and from my professional experience and I told him this wasn&#39;t sitting well, it sounded like a very unhealthy relationship and to please go speak with his pastor or another trusted, at least semi-objective person. My heart is bleeding for this guy but you really never anticipate saying &quot;well yes, if someone was performing oral sex on me I would consider that flirting. Yes, I imagine if I voluntarily put my mouth on your manhood I would want things reciprocated. No, that&#39;s not appropriate for a married woman and a man married to another woman to behave that way*. If that happened to me then yes, I would likely kill Paul and the chick he fooled around with and I&#39;d fully expect him to do the same if I messed around on him. Yes you do need an STD test.&quot; etc. to your mechanic! I don&#39;t need to know how your wife likes it in bed! Or what you like or anything of that nature! But what do you do in that situation? He obviously processes things by talking about it out loud, he was afraid to tell his family, he wanted someone to hear him. But why is it always me? I&#39;m both flattered and flabbergasted when things like this happen, and this one was just too surreal not process it out on trusty old LJ.

Yeah, I could have done with a stiff drink after that but I settled on an iced chai Paul brought home for me. It makes me thankful for my relationship, that we truly can talk about anything that worries us or bothers us and that when surreal crazy stuff happens we&#39;re there to laugh and WTF with each other.

*not that this is a dig against non-traditional marriages/relationships. When you find something that works for you, by all means run with it."

"event","I have devised a way to use a head/hair wrap to hold this ice pack on my head, freeing up my hands. I have had the weirdest, super-painful headache on the right side of my head this week. I thought I maybe got clocked on the back of the head at the Kultur Shock show last Friday (the pit found me, though it likely wasn&#39;t wise for me to be up front for such a high-energy show in the first place) but I don&#39;t remember that happening. I&#39;ve been getting over the &quot;we switched your biologic meds again, have a sinus infection!&quot; upper-respiratory crap and had pulled a muscle in my neck on the left coughing violently but this right side thing isn&#39;t alleviated by muscle relaxers and it&#39;s getting worse each day rather than better. Two percocets and two muscle relaxers didn&#39;t kill it so I&#39;ve been using heat &amp; ice packs. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a migraine since the one-sided pain is really the only common symptom between this &amp; a migraine. It occasionally helps to put pressure on it &amp; though caffeine isn&#39;t really helping it&#39;s a good excuse to drink yummy Starbucks stuff. But it has been so bad for so long I was actually Googling meningitis symptoms, discovering that O HAY! SLE can <b>cause </b>meningitis! If that is what this is, it&#39;s not bacterial or viral so I feel OK waiting for my regular Rheumy appointment this Friday unless it gets worse. When we got home from the pub yesterday I took 2 percocet then right before bed 2 excedrin PM and two muscle relaxers and I think I actually slept all night long which is rare for me and I think it helped a lot so I&#39;m trying that again today. &nbsp;I&#39;ve been feeling like maybe this Actemra is actually making things *worse* and this headache isn&#39;t helping matters. My big joints have been feeling really good but the swelling in my hands and feet keeps getting worse. Paul has had to help me get down the stairs in the mornings and that hasn&#39;t been the case since before/right after diagnosis. Things are so bad I&#39;ve actually taken some prednisone (steroids) the last couple days. For me, that&#39;s freaking desperate. 

Some things though are really helping to keep my spirits up, like the aforementioned Kultur Shock show. We grabbed my brother James and our friend Nanette then swung by to pick up Nathan &amp; Laura from their new place and went to dinner at Annapurna. YUM. Paul ordered a banana lassi because I ordered one and it sounded good but I reminded him it&#39;s yogurt, which he hates. So I had 1 2/3 banana lassis :D We got to the club before they opened the doors and were VERY pleasantly surprised when V and Noah came strolling up! Libby had let them know about the show &amp; I hadn&#39;t seen them since they moved back home. Libby and Stephen made it during the opening act and I always relish a LibbyHug. Everyone really seemed to enjoy the show, especially the bald Russian man climbing me like a mountain. The pit WILL find you! LOL Alice is finally back from her trip to New Zealand so our Wednesday &quot;Supernatural&quot; routine is back on track. Last night we took Alice and Nanette to this Irish pub we found in Renton where OMG the food is amazing and since it&#39;s not far from my dad&#39;s house James came and joined us. I&#39;m really glad he&#39;s been coming out with us so much and I&#39;m finally getting to form an actual relationship with him. He&#39;s turning into a really great guy and I enjoy spending time with him plus I think its helping to widen his social circle beyond the people he went to high school with that never left. And today Paul &amp; I went to a partner yoga workshop taught by my flow teacher and her husband. She joked that this was the only time he&#39;d ever get on a mat but he seemed like a pretty cool dude. It wasn&#39;t as hardcore as our usual vinyasa classes but we got to do some interesting poses and got some good deep stretches in. And it was FUN! I only recognized one person from my other classes but everyone was friendly and we spent the majority of the class laughing and enjoying ourselves. Plus it did wonders for my mental health to be able to follow through with something I&#39;ve been looking forward to for months even with my body in a nose dive. We hung back after the class to talk with Pamela and her husband. He told me Pamela talks about me a lot and how impressed she is with me (serious blushing was happening I&#39;m sure) and we talked about the effectiveness of massage (great for her, not so much for me), acupuncture (which I may need to give another shot to see what/if it could help), yoga, and she suggested a sauna. She said it had been helping he tremendously lately despite seeming counter-intuitive (she has MS. Heat and auto-immune stuff usually aren&#39;t a great mix). She said she found a little two person indoor sauna on Craigslist and that she doesn&#39;t have to turn it up real high for it to be effective. Then we argued over who had it worse LOL She was claiming I&#39;m way worse off but I&#39;m like &quot;you have MS! It&#39;s no walk in the park!&quot; SO thankful I found that studio. Thanks, random bellydance instructor for not showing up the day we tried to take your class causing us to go check out the yoga class instead. Afterward Paul &amp; I walked down the block to the co-op and spent far too much money before coming home and cooking our fancy Valentine&#39;s dinner (I was too wrecked Thursday). Also ridiculously thankful for my husband. He&#39;s so supportive and amazing.

Zedd has also been reinforcing my suspicions that I&#39;m somehow a witch and he&#39;s my familiar or something. He knows where I&#39;m hurting and he will lay on that spot. I woke up the other morning with him curled around my right arm with his chest in my hand so his heart beat on my palm, which had been hurting me. If he&#39;s not sprawled out on me or curled up next to me, he&#39;s sitting sentry at my feet. If I do notice he&#39;s not there, he appears as soon as I wonder where he is. I&#39;ve explained he needs to live for at least 30 more people years. I also sometimes wonder if he&#39;s the spirit of my cat Kibbles, who shared many of the same attributes. Cats are the best ever.

Dreaming about having to move suddenly and scavenger hunts through Las Vegas in California that happens to also be an antique/Hallmark store is getting old. I always have long, vivid dreams but why do they have to drift into baggage territory? I&#39;m sure this means I really need to find a therapist but I don&#39;t want to. Yet.

I&#39;m working on trying to do positive things for myself and not wallow in the Rupus and depression. I bought a little stepper machine and am slowly working my way into doing it for what could be called a length of time. I&#39;m only at about 3 minutes at a time a couple times a day, but it&#39;s something. I&#39;m hoping now that I&#39;m being treated for all the crazy body stuff I&#39;ll finally be able to shed some weight. Mostly though, it&#39;s ego. My pudge is getting in the way at yoga. There are poses I know I can do and that my stretches can be much deeper but this damn pudge is yoga-blocking me. I&#39;m way more impressive than this, damnit!

Before the holidays I went to a little open house type thing for a talent agency in Seattle. I contacted them about getting into voice-over work and they responded really positively...until they saw me. She was careful to point out to the group that they don&#39;t exclusively deal in voice-over, that they want well-rounded talent that can do commercials, print work, and voice-over. Can I do these things? Hell yes. Do they put people like me on TV or magazines? Not really. So even though I contacted them again after the meeting, telling them I&#39;d be interested about meeting one-on-one to explore options I haven&#39;t gotten any kind of response from them. It&#39;s been 6 weeks, reading between the lines tells me this isn&#39;t going to happen. What&#39;s weird though is that in the past month I&#39;ve been e-mailing around looking for voice lessons in the area in an attempt to get my classical chops back up (which would make me feel so much better) and perhaps to perform in some capacity again. No responses. I&#39;m beginning to think my emails are just being sucked into some black hole somewhere and it&#39;s getting really discouraging.

But tomorrow I get a haircut. And probably coffee. That will help."

Having divorced parents, the holidays have always been a little hectic splitting between two houses. Then Dad moved to Seattle (while Mom &amp; I were still in Spokane) and I would fly to Seattle on Christmas day. Once Mom and I moved over here I had &quot;Christmas&quot; at Dad&#39;s, then Mom&#39;s, then we&#39;d drive to my uncle&#39;s THEN a couple hours south to see the rest of mom&#39;s side of the family. After I married Stump, that added more stops on the holiday parade and more stress. When I finally came to my senses and left him (for those that may not know, my first marriage was severely emotionally/mentally abusive) it was a couple weeks before Christmas so now every December I get that strange trauma/PTSD uneasiness. So not my favorite time of year LOL. Thankfully, Paul&#39;s family doesn&#39;t celebrate the holidays.&nbsp;

This year I was able to talk my dad into just going to a fancy dinner for Christmas Eve. Both he and James will see something they want &amp; buy it and never have any ideas for gifts they want. My stepmother never gives ideas either, plus I get the same reaction regardless of what I get her anyway. I was telling a friend of mine &quot;I could get her a check for a million dollars or a jar of farts and get the same response: &#39;Oh, how nice, thank you&#39; so it makes it hard to give a damn&quot; Dad has always said he only likes the holidays because he gets to spend time with the family so I suggested this year we just DO something and it worked! Next year we&#39;re going to try and plan ahead a bit more and maybe go to the Nutcracker or other event after dinner or even just go back to the house and bake cookies or something.

I really like giving gifts though, just not when it&#39;s obligatory. The best gifts (to me) are the ones where you see something you know someone would love and surprise them with it. Why wait? Of course, sometimes you get holiday catalogs and see the ideal gift like say...Doctor Who salt &amp; pepper shakers and impulsively buy them for Alice :D She flipped. It was awesome.

My favorite part of gift-giving is always the wrapping. I LOVE to wrap gifts, but with my Rupus paws I&#39;m super-limited so that makes me more grouchy.

Health-wise, I tried methotrexate and did not tolerate it at all. I committed to doing all four doses (they are once a week) to make sure that this wasn&#39;t just a psychosomatic reaction (making myself reject the last-resort drug I was afraid of taking) but I kept a symptom list. At my next appointment though Dr. Gorman didn&#39;t notice a difference in my joints and said even if she did the side-effects weren&#39;t worth continuing. So I&#39;ve been switched back from Cellcept to Imuran. They seem to have the same effect, the Imuran might even edge it out, but the Cellcept was making my sed. rate go back up. This past week I was switched from the Orencia infusion to the Actemra infusion with a healthy dose of IV steroids on top of it in the hopes that it will let Actemra gain a foothold. At Friday&#39;s appointment she walked in saying &quot;Hi Melissa! I know this is early for you, how&#39;s your morning stiffne-NO! No, no your hands! Let me wash my hands real quick...NO! Crap. These joints are so gummy, Crap! You&#39;re backsliding! No no no!&quot;, hence the steroid suggestion :) I got Natalie as my poker though and she&#39;s my favorite so we chatted for a bit while she got me hooked up for drugs. So far things seem...OK, but I&#39;m giving it another week until I know the steroids have worn off before I get too excited. I&#39;m not a fan of these IV steroids though, they make me feel kind of amped but not in a positive way. I had to beg off of a show that Nathan booked for the weekend due to side-effects but at this point I&#39;m cautiously optimistic. I should be able to make it to yoga on Sunday, which would rule because I haven&#39;t been in weeks due to swelling &amp; paw pain.

On New Year&#39;s Eve Paul and I went for Thai food then off to buy me a new wrist brace. We live a wild life, folks! LOL"

"event","Today at the Rheumatologist I had to consent to the last-ditch effort of Methotrexate. My initial worry is the potential for further hair loss (though it only happens in about 2% of patients I also managed to develop eczema...while on medication used to TREAT eczema so I&#39;m betting on being in that 2%) while her initial worry was that it would have negative effects on my liver which it can be prone to do. Before getting treated for Rupus my liver function tests had been elevated but stable but since getting treatment with Dr. Gorman they&#39;ve been normal. So while we don&#39;t want to poke the bear, my liver has also taken a very &quot;yeah, whatever&quot; stance with every other medication we&#39;ve thrown at it so we&#39;re not AS worried as we had previously been. Methotrexate is usually the gold standard for treating RA, but it was kind of our last resort for the above reasons. I&#39;m kinda out of options though. I&#39;m TWO YEARS into this flare with no relief, no end in sight. Granted, I&#39;m leaps and bounds ahead of where I was but most patients get under control in 3-6 months and I&#39;m still dragging along which is pretty rare. According to my last round of labs, my Lupus is pretty much dormant which is amazing on one hand but on the other it just opens this up to more questions as to why I&#39;m having so much trouble. I was tested today for hemochomatosis, which my dad just told me he was diagnosed with and can mimic some RA symptoms but it&#39;s a bit of a long shot. So is lymphoma since my labs don&#39;t really indicate it but we might have to look further into that as well. I had another round of hand &amp; foot X-rays today to compare them to the ones from two years ago to see if there are any changes, positive or negative. I&#39;m starting on Celebrex to see if I can sleep for more than two hours at a damn stretch without having to resort to muscle relaxers and percocet. Both Jennifer (my nurse) and Dr. Gorman both were like &quot;Take it! Do you need more? We&#39;ll give you whatever you need, sleep damnit!&quot; My concern though is that I&#39;ll become dependent. Not necessarily addicted but I know psychologically if I make a regimen out of that I&#39;m likely to feel like I can&#39;t sleep without it. I&#39;ve got to start taking folic acid now too to counteract the methotrexate. This brings my daily pill count to 9, not counting any advil, muscle relaxers or narcotics I may need on any given day. Plus since my nerve issues have cropped back up I&#39;m doing another course of steroids. If it improves, it&#39;s the swelling &amp; inflammation from the RA pinching or restricting the nerves. If it doesn&#39;t improve, then who the Hell knows.

I&#39;m honestly terrified that this last ditch effort won&#39;t work, given that nothing else has cleared this crap up. Once I&#39;m swapped from Cellcept to methotrexate (provided I tolerate the medication) if there&#39;s not enough progress then we look into switching my infusions again. I told her I was doing OK with the Cellcept nausea if I kept up with the ginger and she&#39;s like &quot;Then I&#39;m not doing my job. You should be on a regimen that makes you feel fantastic, no side-effects.&quot; Which makes me feel bad. She&#39;s obviously doing the best she can and it&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t improved *at all* but I can tell she&#39;s starting to kind of take it personally that she hasn&#39;t knocked me into remission yet. The look in her eyes when I told her about the nerve issues today made me want to cry. She&#39;s the best doctor I&#39;ve ever seen for any reason. She listens, lets me make decisions, loves my husband and takes her time with me. I truly could not ask for more. I&#39;m so afraid now though that nothing is ever going to resolve this, that I&#39;ve permanently plateaued and this is as good as it gets. What bothers me more than anything though is that this is all I&#39;ve got now. I can&#39;t work, all I have to talk about really when people ask me what&#39;s going on is &quot;well, drugs/joint pain/swelling/ blahblah&quot; and that&#39;s it. I was telling Nanette about that one night on the way to yoga and she said &quot;we&#39;re not your friends because of the things you do. So this is what you&#39;re dealing with right now- you&#39;re still Mel, we still love you.&quot; which made me feel both warm and ashamed, if that makes any sense.

I just feel like I&#39;m chasing my tail. Thank God for husbands and cats and yoga or I would&#39;ve lost my damn mind by now."

"event","So the &quot;good&quot; news is that I was approved for Social Security Disability. It was surprising since I&#39;d only appealed once; I was expecting to have to go all the way to the hearing level. They gave me some back-pay and my monthly payments start next month. Have I mentioned that I am the poster child for white liberal guilt? It&#39;s not like I lost a leg in Vietnam or anything, I&#39;m still mostly mobile some days. Alice thinks it went through because of my hands, that when most people get denied for medical reasons they get a letter saying &quot;while we agree you&#39;re a mess and can&#39;t do your current job without&nbsp;accommodation, you should be able to get accommodations through your current job or do any number of other jobs that work with/around your current disability&quot; and no one can think of any jobs I can do without HANDS. Aside from the joint pain, fatigue, brain fog, etc. I still feel like &quot;I&#39;m not dead yet! I can still do something!&quot; But really who is going to hire me when my cover letter would be &quot;Hi, I&#39;m totally qualified for this job and would kick it&#39;s ass, but I may only be able to kick it&#39;s ass one day a week or a few hours a day or something. It&#39;s Rupus, it&#39;s unpredictable. But I sure do like paychecks and feeling useful. Oh, and I usually can&#39;t use my hands. :D&quot; So while it will be nice to have consistent income and not have to worry much about money, I still don&#39;t feel like I deserve it. I&#39;m the one who helps, I&#39;m not the one who gets help. (I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s anything wrong with getting help, I&#39;m saying rarely am I in the position where I actually get it- deserving or not)

But with this extra back pay money we&#39;re seriously considering having the living room walls drywalled. We&#39;ve gotten bids and have a guy we like, we&#39;ve just got to pull the trigger. I also need to know specifics/logistics like if we need to be out of the house, do we need to move the pets, how flexible is their schedule since we sleep late? Because I am a Virgo and I like to know things. With the living room done I think I won&#39;t hate this house as much, which would be good since I&#39;m stuck in it so much lately.

You know, when I was little I used to hope I&#39;d get cancer or hit by a car or something so people would pay attention to me (single parent, weird kid without a lot of friends). So in some insane, unrealistic way I feel like I&#39;ve done this to myself. Like thinking that flipped some cosmic switch and I never thought/was never able to flip it back. However it happened, it&#39;s SO not worth the money or attention."

"event","Good news, I no longer burst into tears at the thought of Morrissey :)

I was talking to my dad yesterday and he was asking how I was feeling, etc. I told him I still hadn&#39;t heard from Social Security about my disability yet but that wasn&#39;t surprising, got him up to date on my med situation. It&#39;s been nearly two years since this flare erupted and I still don&#39;t have a handle on it. Switching from IV therapy to weekly injections made my sed. rate increase again so obviously the flood is just barely being held back; I&#39;m not anywhere near remission yet. &nbsp;He was asking if I was going to get back into social work when I could go back to work &amp; I&#39;m still not sure. I could work on the macro level but I don&#39;t like that kind of work. I was telling him I thought about going into business because I&#39;m good at it but I don&#39;t enjoy that either. I&#39;ve thought about medical transcription or something but this disease loves to live in my hands and transcription requires speed and availability which who knows if I could give? And he&#39;s like &quot;No, no, no- don&#39;t do a job you don&#39;t like just because you can make money at it. Why not get into computers, like software or something?&quot; Yeah...typing out code and typing out medical transcriptions...pretty much the same thing. I also have no interest in software. So I&#39;m still at a loss about what to do when I can get back to work. If we can afford it, I may just look into volunteer things.&nbsp;

My next door neighbor called a couple hours ago to let me know our garage door was open. I said &quot;that&#39;s odd, I wonder how long it&#39;s been open&quot; and she said &quot;oh all afternoon. I&#39;d been keeping an eye on it but now it&#39;s dark and I thought you might not be aware it was still open.&quot; My 88 year old neighbor, ladies and gentlemen. Now I&#39;m really glad I insisted on checking on her during the ice storms and giving her our number. Humanity is not dead!"

"event","I did something I rarely do and spent a decent amount of money on something that was just for me: Morrissey tickets. 11th row OMG. I woke up early (for me) to be on the computer the second tickets went on sale. 99% of the time I hear someone is coming that I&#39;m dying to see I rationalize a reason I shouldn&#39;t go: it&#39;s too expensive, it&#39;s selfish, I&#39;d never get decent seats. This spell was sort of broken last year when I got Erasure tickets, but Nathan really bought them for me as a birthday gift. And that show was bloody amazing.

So now I have amazing seats to see Morrissey, who lives in a very tiny place inside of me that I rarely touch. I&#39;ve been on the verge of tears from the moment I got the tickets and I&#39;m not *really* sure why. He appeared in my life at a weird time. I was around 14; at my dad&#39;s house my room had been given to my brother and they put my bed in the basement that was full of spiders and had sheets for walls. All I had was the radio- and Morrissey. At home (my mom&#39;s) I was starting to realize that I was always going to be the girl that boys liked...to talk to about the girls they liked. I was also writing sh*tty teenage poetry and discovering I was getting a lot of attention for singing. So it could be that his voice yanks me back to a tumultuous time, but right now happens to be rather tumultuous as well. The Rupus has me feeling so hopeless and discouraged and not being able to have a job is driving me crazy. I&#39;ve always been painfully independent and it terrifies me that if anything happened to Paul I&#39;d be dead in the water. I need to get back to therapy, work through the Rupus stuff and address the damage that Stump did.

So I&#39;ve been listening to Morrissey non-stop for days and feeling to joyful and depressed. Apt, no?"

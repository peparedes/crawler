"event","<br />This is day one.<br /><br />I decided I've got to do something with all this anger and depression over something I will never have and putting it to good use. I want to lose weight, and I think I finally have the motivation to do so. I went out and actually walked for about a mile and a half or so -- then called Ryan trying to see if he could get me into his gym. The shitty thing was it cost 3 bucks to get in which I didnt have which sucked. I then went to work and ended up making a salad without any rice or cheese on it trying to avoid that shit.<br /><br />My current weight is 220lbs.<br />My waist size is somewhere between 38 and 40.<br /><br />My goal is to get to 180lbs<br />And a wasit of 32.<br /><br />It's going to be a hard hard hard, but it will be worth it.<br /><br />My new diet is just common sense stuff for right now. I'm giving up all red meat, potatoes, ketchup, rice, starch, and hopefully bread on a give or take basis on it. I'm also going to give up soda's and try to stick to Unsweet Tea and water again.<br />I really hope this pays off.&nbsp;<br /><br />I cut two pictures of how my body looks now, hopefully in a few months I can look back and say ""man, I really was fat as fuck.""<br /><br />haha.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Pictures"">Type your cut contents here.</div><img alt="""" src=""http://a3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/78/m_8c32ccbb946c89d0e474e9dabb2276c2.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://a616.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/96/m_6914d523e298db63c9f66215e0bde7af.jpg"" /><br />"

It is worthless to even put energy into something so futile. Instead I'm going to use this journal for something positive and it will become a log book for my new weight loss plan. It will be friends only, with the exception of a few public entries when I feel I have made some positive headway.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thank you.&nbsp; -- Kerry.</font><br /></font></p>"

The sad part about this...I'm not talking about a person, I'm talking about a place...San Francisco...I miss it and the people so much my heart hurts. All the time. Everytime I think about it.

When I think about it, I can feel myself walking down the streets or sitting in Yerba Buena or walking up to Border's bookstore. Or riding on the train. I wish I could be there now..."

"event","Okay, so, Karen Kingsbury is one of my favorite authors. I've been reading a series about the Baxter family in the past two weeks. There are three series about them and I'm in the second series. Anyway, enough with the background information. One of the main characters in the book is Ashley Baxter. She is in her late twenties at the pint in the book I'm about to give you. She has a little son named Cole who is in the first grade. This possibly the best excerpt from a book I've ever read. I could not contain my laughter...hopefully you think it's as funny as I do =)

Cole shifted so he could see her better. ""I kicked a boy today.""
The announcment jolted Ashley back to the moment. ""Coley!"" She cast a glance at her son. Cole was one of the kindest boys she'd ever known. his teachers had always said so. ""Why would you kick someone?""
""He needed a kick, Mommy. No one else would give it to him."" He shrugged. ""So I did.""
Ashley was tempted to pull over. She fought to keep her cool. ""Cole, no one needs a kick. Why don't you tell me the story.""
""Okay, well, you know that mean guy in fourth grade, the one named Brent?""
""Yes."" Ashley turne donto Main Street. She was just a few blocks from Sunset hills. ""Brent McHouston, right?:
""Right."" Cole didn't look or sound ruffled. Whatever had happened, he felt justified. ""So there's this kindergartener named Micah, only he's a little guy, Mommy. Littler than all the other kindergarteners, and he's got forever crutches.""
""Forever crutches?"" Ashley gave Cole another quick look.
""teacher said Micah had cruthces forever, 'cause he was born that way. you know, Mommy. Forever cruthces.""
""Okay."" Ashley felt her heart begin to melt. ""So there's Micah with his forever cruthces...""
""And me and the boys were playing soccer, but here comes Micah on his forever cruthces, real slow 'cause that how Micah always comes. real slow. only right at that 'zact moment bretn comes up and grabs one of Micah's cruthces.""
""no! That's terrible!""
""I know!"" Cole's voice rose a notch. ""It is terrible, Mommy. 'Cause Micah fell and brent ran all over the playground waving the crutch in the air. And then finally he came back to Micah and pointed at him and laughed.""
""He did?""
""yes and pointing and laughing are two of the meanest things, Mommy. Case you didn't know""
The light ahead of Ashley turned red and she eased the van to a stop. Then she looked at Cole. ""That even more terrible, Coley""
""I know. It is more terrible. And all us boys were there watching from behind, but no one did anything about. So finally I asked myself what Jesus would do if He was playing soccer beside me, you kno?""
""Yes"" Ashley stifled a grin.
""AND I FIGGERED IT OUT! JESUS WOULD WALK RIGHT UP BEHIND THAT BAD OL' BRENT AND KICK HIM IN THE LEG!"" Cole smile sweetly. ""taht how come I knew he needed a kick.""
""So....""Ashley could see where the story was going.
Cole gulped. ""I walked right up to that boy and kicke dhim hard in the back of the leg. He dropped Micah's crutch right then, and he turned around. That's when I kicked him again; only that time I started running."" Cole giggled. ""I ran and ran, faster and faster, mommy. That Brent isn't very fast, I found out. He stuck his tongue out at me before we went into class""


bahahaha. i love little boys. even if they are fictionalized characters because I can see some sweet little boy saying that...."

"event","Jamie, the founder of To Write Love On Her Arms, always has a beautiful way of words...here is a few things from blogs he's written that I love and believe to be so true...

""People get stuck in moments. Hearts break and don't fix easy. Love is nothing easy. It is not cheap. It is the greatest thing that happens on this planet, and so it comes priced as gold. One of my best friends used to sing the words ""love is war"". There is the fight for holding on. And the fight for letting go. The hardest thing i have ever experienced is the learning which and when. But i still say it's worth it, that love is real and possible. There are things worth fighting for, and love is at the top of the list...""

""But we are still here, you and me... And so the question is what to do with that. What to do with the news of the day, and this air that still remains in our lungs. i would say these things: You are not alone. Your life matters. Your story is important. You are alive tonight for a reason. You were created to love and to be loved. You were not meant to be alone. You are not alone. You were meant to do life with other people. You need people who know you. You need to know people. Your voice matters.""

and to end on a humorous note...
""Guys don't need personal trainers. They need women that are just out of reach"""

This place has nothing for me. I've never felt more non-purposeful in my life. It's disgusting. I'm constantly thinking of a way to get out of here. It's sad. 

There's nothing here for me except a free ride to school and my dog. I have a couple of wonderful friends that I would miss. But other than that, I'm just here.

About to walk a path I've gotta take
I am packing up heading out
I can't sleep I'm dreaming way too loud
I'm so close now, so close now

Nothing changes and that's not good for me
I need a break. I need something new
I need to replace these old worn out broken shoes

On the plane I prayed about God instilling my passion for learning again. Ever since the summer has ended and school has started, I haven't wanted to be at school or in class. But now I do. It's back and it's amazing. Not only for my school studies, but for the Bible.

"event","In my entire life, I've only seen two people who have passed away who don't look like themselves at all at the funeral. Last night was the second person.

My dad's best friend from the guard died suddenly after contracting Legionnaire's disease (it attacks the lungs). All I can remember growing up is PW being the center of attention and him being like a second dad to me. Every weeekend my dad, mom and I would go over to their house and swim every Saturday. Their daughter, Alice (now Allison) and I were best friends back then. I really miss those days because everything was so simple back then. PW was probably one of the most random/most hysterical men you would ever meet.

When we went up to say something to his wife and daughter (they also had a new baby about 7 years ago...she grew up fast...good grief) but she was running around, my dad had to leave abruptly because he was in ""police mode"" and didn't want to cry. It didn't look like PW at all. They had shaved his mustache off. I didn't like it one bit. It didn't look like him. I tried not to cry and I was glad my dad walked off because I did too because I didn't want to start bawling in front of everyone. 

It was hard to see my dad like that. He finally went back up there after he regained compsure. I didn't go this time. I couldn't see PW like that again. When my dad was coming back to sit down with us he started crying. I've hardly ever seen my dad cry. Maybe twice in my life. 

This is really random, but I miss PW and I miss being little and seeing him all the time. We sat in the back with some rest of the people from the Guard unit and told stories about him. Believe me, there are some crazy ones. That man left a good impression on the world and everyone loved him.

I'm sad.

I'm leaving for Virginia in a few minutes.

Happy 28th Birthday tomorrow, Sissy! i miss you."

This song has brought me such joy the past couple of days. I've always liked it but when I listen to it now I listen to it in a different way. 

""And I don't care what the world throws at me now...It's gonna be alright!"" ""Cause I know my God saved the day and I know His word never fails and I know my God made a way for me""...."

My mom and I were talking yesterday about something and I was like, if God wanted it that way He would let it be. She was liked, ""Have you asked?"" and I said ""No, God knows the deepest desires of our heart"" and she said ""I know, but He wants you to ask also!"" Well, she got to work today and that was on her Daily Calendar for Christian Women.  I found this very encouraging.

I did tell Him last night. Whether or not that's what He wants for me right now is different. But at least I asked. =)"

I've realized, again, that you can't always be a continuous high. God will break you. But that's good because I need to remember how good He is. 

It's been a while since I've cried like this and I guess it was about due time that I did.

I've talked to someone who I used to tell everything to and it was good to talk to them again and to also to realize again that you have no feelings like that for them anymore. It's good to have someone just as a friend that you can confide in. 

I'm ready for this summer. I'm ready to be away and let God do some good things. 

It's good to have a God who loves you even when you fail numerous times. I've got to give up what hinders me in my relationship with Him. It's also hindering my relationship with others. TAKE IT AWAY.

Things are changing and I'm not sure how I feel about it."

my heart was hurting on the drive back to tuscaloosa. literally. it was real weird. 

my mom was sad today. i wouldn't let ed go when i gave him a hug bye. i started crying and he laughed at me. i guess it was kind of funny. but, seriously, i'm going to miss him. he's pretty much the coolest step-dad anyone could have. i mean, i'm acting like he's going off to war or something. it's just going to be weird going home on weekends and him not being there. i'm so sad that my mom is going to be all by herself this summer while i'm in california and ed is in colorado. =(. someone please go visit her and keep her company."

"event","Well, Ed had to go trade his truck in today for a four-wheel drive. He's moving up to Colorado in the next couple of weeks; he's going up there to work. This probably means I'll be going home a lot on weekends because my mom will be lonesome. She stays busy during the week with work and she'll have Maggie to keep her occupied but I know she'll need me most weekends because she'll get bored. I probably won't see Ed again until after I get back from San Francisco; that is if my mom and I don't go out there before I leave for San Francisco, which is highly doubtful because she's always working and can never seem to get away. I'm sad because I love my step-dad to death but I'm used to having my fathers gone. Ed used to work out of town ALL THE TIME and then I always watched my dad deploy for war. Is it weird that I'm not really depressed about it? I guess it's just because I'm used to it. 

I feel like clop. I HATE BEING A GIRL. 

On another note...why do people trade their morals in? I find it highly amusing that someone who was so against drinking at one point is now drinking. It actually pisses me off...not because I care that they're drinking but that they used to get mad at me if I ever had a drink of something. They're not the only one who pisses me off about that kind of stuff. It's amazing how you will change for some people. 

I've realized that there are select few people that I will miss this summer. I can name them on a hand and a couple of fingers. But I guess one of the fingers doesn't really count because one of them is a dog. But whatever.

I think I'm going to watch the fourth Harry Potter now (I'm obsessed!).

EDIT: I just finished talking to my mom on the phone. I'm now upset about Ed moving. My mom sounded like she was about to cry. Now I""m sad. BOO."

"event","I've realized some relationships aren't worth fighting for. Just because you have so much invested in it doesn't mean that it's healthy. You feel like you put every effort into everything but you receive nothing but false hope. The ""I promises"" or ""I'll change"" but you never see it happen. It's amazing how people can change for other people too. Sometimes, it's not worth the investment and getting your hopes up again. 

Sometimes though, it's just hard to give up."

"event","Daddy's been a back-row Baptist,
With his share of front-row sin.
His Saturday night still on his breathe,
Every Sunday when he'd walk in.
He's never led the Benediction,
He's never sang in the choir.
But he's an angel with no halo,
An' one wing in the fire.

Mamma lives by the Bible,
The Bible lives by the bed.
An' she's lied alone so many nights,
With scriptures in her head.
Prayin': ""Good Lord, just be with him,
""I know his Faith is tired,
""But he's an angel with no halo,
""An' one wing in the fire.""

""An' I know he lives a little left of livin' right,
""An he's come close to goin' way to far a few times.
""But I'd trade a thousand prayers if just one prayer would come true:
""Lord, please believe in him, like I believe in you.""

Dady's always been there for me,
From T-Ball to touchdowns.
Fixed my car an' fixed my heart,
When they've been broken down.
I know he calls for more forgiveness,
Than most folks do require,
But he's an angel with no halo,
An' one wing in the fire.

An' I know he lives a little left of livin' right,
An he's come close to goin' way to far a few times.
But I'd trade a thousand prayers if just one prayer would come true:
Lord, please believe in him, like I believe in you.

Well, I just can't imagine,
What Heaven might be like.
If me an' Mamma make it,
Wiithout Daddy by our side.
Lord, could you please remember,
When it's time to call us higher:
That he's an angel with no halo,
An' one wing in the fire.
Ooooh.

"event","""Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. He said, 'In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men. And there was a widow in that town who keps coming to him with the plea, 'Grant me justice against my adversary'. For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself 'Even though I don't fear God or care about men, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually wear me out with her coming'. And the Lord said, 'Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for His chosen ones who cry out to Him day and night? Will He keep putting them off? I tell you, He will see that they get justice and qucikly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?""
Luke 18: 1-8

I was just reading my Bible and that passage really spoke to me. I've been praying about a lot lately and sometimes I feel like giving up; I know I'm not the only one who feels this way right now. That's why I had to post this. 

DON'T GIVE UP."

I feel really convicted about writing those out of spite. I was just trying to amuse myself about the situation, and it is a funny one if you know it, but, still, I shouldn't be making fun of it. Rather praying that it gets better and that you get out of that hole you're in. I'm sorry I couldn't be bigger than that. I really am.

My past has been haunting me lately. I feel like some of the things I've done have hindered the way people look at me. This song by the Fray explains how I feel.

""Fall Away""
You swear you recall nothing at all
That could make you come back down
You made up your mind to leave it all behind
Now you're forced to fight it out

You fall away from your past
But it's following you

You left something undone, it's now your rerun
It's the one you can't erase
You should have made it right, so you wouldn't have to fight
To put a smile back on your face

You fall away from your past
But it's following you
You fall away

Something I've done that I can't outrun
Maybe you should wait maybe you should run
But there's something you've said that can't be undone

And you fall away from your past
But It's following you

You fall away
It's following you


But, it's not people that matter. It's God. And when I ask Him to forgive me for what I've done wrong, He instantly erases it from his mind. It is no longer there. So I need to work on erasing it from my mind. Not completely. Because what I've gone through has shaped me into who I am today. Maybe it will help me when I'm working with youth. And I reall think it does. It just amazes me how He can just forget about it and love me the same. People don't do that. He is amazing. I wish I could learn to forgive myself like He forgives me.

What an amazing God I have.

This is a verse that my friend posted on her myspace. It's not in the words my Bible uses, but it's the same point. It's an amazing verse.

""Is anyone crying for help? God is listening, 
 He is ready to RESCUE you""

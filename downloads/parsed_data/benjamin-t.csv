"event","Tonight I went to the good ol cheerleading thing at Center Grove High School with Brian, Derrick, Cadee, Whitney, and the wonderful or not so wonderful Jordynn Hurley.

It was pretty decent for the most part but then at the beginning she was all pouty as usual. We had a blast the 4 of us excluding Brian and Jordynn since they were performing but Brian did really good.

Jordynn got hyper or some shit and started acted moronic like the ditz she is and blowing her fucking whistle every 2 seconds. Of course I'm the only one that ever does anything so I just give it the ol shut the fuck up. I got home and she talked shit about me on the way home. I made fun of her some for the whole thing about her giving an ogre a bj which is hilarious but it's not biggy. She just annoys the fuck out of everyone around her its overwhelming. So we fight online and instead of doing the intelligent thing she is the person that doesn't like confrontation at all. She likes going ""I don't like him tell him you'll beat him up."" Wait when was that being a pussy..O..never. Dealing with your personal problems yourself isn't easy enough. Better get my friends involved. Then she pulls something out of her ass that I wear makeup. LMFAO. Like...to even think of using that as a lie your IQ must be below 50. So basically in conclusion..she is the kind of person who results in friends and lying when she fucks up something. Your a sharp one...ditz. 


Tommorow is the b-day so I'm going out to dinner or something. See you at Stompfest this weekend, those of you going.

Woke up and felt waaaaaaaay too tired to go to school so I decided to stay home and be sick. Hey, I got 13 hours of sleep. I think it was worth it.

I can't remember if I journaled this yet but this girl that used to go to New Pal that moved to Texas is moving back to Indiana. Just my luck she's coming to my school. Stoked. lol.

"event","So I went to go weigh myself and my weight is down to like 137. That means I lost like 9 pounds this week leaving my BMI at a low 17.9. Woot. 

So yesterday was kinda unfun and fun. I woke up and went to the Boat Sport and Travel Show with the family. 
After that I left with Brian to the competition which was fun and lame at the same time. I came home about 9:30 and talked to people online and did some homework.

The 36 liquid diet does work you fools so try it. Drink liquids only for 36 hours and you'll lose the pounds.

So like this Friday is gonna be the best since I get to go to Cadence's Church lock-in for 12 hours of non-stop holy fun!

And Jade is like the smartest gal I know.

So today at 10 we went to the tanning place to sign up then me and Brian went to some places to get some stuff and look at stuff. Yea my fingers hurt so I'm not giving details tonight. So we go to the mall with some people and like me and Brian hate Jordynn for being a bitch and almost make her cry. Amen my lord. So we go to the competition and ignore her and they do their thing. We leave and hit the steak and shake and eat. After that we met Jade at the ice rink to skate till 10. Brian drove me home and here I am now... talking to the wonderful friends I have online. You know who you are.

Ok enuff of the kiddie stuff lets get down to bizznass. 

So today I went to the gym to see Gonzo and Fozzy for some Ultra Star fun... I mean, Judith and Brian.

After the upmost wonderful time we had, we had to ""go to ft. wayne to help his mom with her car.""

O yea, what else was I going to put in here... Ahh. Judith has once again done it again. She has proved herself to be above all and share with me her wonderful knowledge on life. With her doing this, I am inclined to once again dedicate a third journal entry to her. 

Saturday will be a joyous day once again. At approximately 10:30 me and Roger with be meeting Brian at Darque Bodies so I can start tanning and so forth. After that were going to Best Buy so Brian can buy his new phone. At about 1 we have to go pick up Jordynn for the competition at 4. The car ride should be interesting...and Brian better keep the music loud and chatter to the minimum.

"event","So like fun times at Mt Vernon High...or not.

I've just determined the benefits of being black at my school.

1. You can say ""nigger what is up?"" when you want and no one say anything to you. Mainly because your surrounded by the rest of your ""posse.""

2. You can be as loud as you want...the rest of society ignores it and so does the more intelligent part of my school.

3. You can wear your pants around your knees. Why? Damn you couldn't afford a belt?

4. You can try rapping and looking like a fool..oo...I mean ""tru thug.""


So I wanna try to get a job at like Kroger or somewhere. ""Working so hard for that might dollar.""

"event","god i am fucking bord, not just in general, with life ass well, nothing ever fucking exciting happens! seems like every fucking day repeats it self like one sick circle. always the same shit, the same concept of time and the same actions leading to one final daily goal... to take over the world.. well not really its really ending up going to sleep to repeat the same shit again and again until we aLL wake up one day and realize that our youth has been taken and our memories have been watered down to the point of nothingness and any significance that has given your life individualized meaning is gone. hmm. im bord. that screw driver on the ground looks fun, maybe i will attempt to amuse my self with it. ok that was fun for about five mins. anyway i hope the fucking world blows up. im praying for mayhem praying for title waves. i cannot wait until the sea engulfs us all and every one who ever ment anything will have to suffer for survival just like the rest of us. gasping for air along side of the one you call enemy. it will fucking be great. fuck you all. rott i say rott!!! let all of you bleed out to death and your rotting corpse aroma will become my rose garden."

"event","once again things seem to be uncontrolably chaotic. the last few weeks have been really bad. i went to the bar with one of my friends and apparently almost killed some one. dont rembmer much except i had too much to drink and started to view other people as helpless animals. the weird primative feeling kicked in and the whole survival skill thing hapened. so i guess what happened was some guy started shit with me and ended up crying and bleeding in a dark corner of the bar.again i dont rmember i found this out from friends. then after that a few days later. i woke up in my basment and look over and saw an empty bottle of jack daniels and a really bloody razor blade next to it. so i began to look around some more and notice the rug i have apprearently slept on was also drenched in blood so i proceed to look down to notice im not wearing a shirt and found very large deep cuts from my chest to my stomach. again. dont know how this happened. life has really been sucking as of late. i cant really control the way things are going and do not enjoy the direction they are going.i also have been noticing i espesially completely hate any human contact. i have always but the amount of this hatred comes in waves.i have been trying to see a therapist but to my fucking supreise no one will take me due to my shitty HMO insurance, god that is gay!!! also im kinda picky. cant really pour my life out to just any one. gahh its a short trip to the mental institution..................."

"event","it has been milleniums scince i last have entered any thing. nothing really has changed except i see alot more dead bodies. for every one who deosnt know me i go to school to be a mortician. its fun .the only way i feel i can express the death that i so engulf my self with on a daily basis.next week for class we get to visit a crematorium. yay!! i love that burning flesh smell. its kinda like the smell of coffee in the morning but with more death. relationships are funny. one moment you think your  happy then things change. the key word is change. every day change takes place, and you as an individual have to enforce your adaptation skills to the limit. it would be nice if things stayed the same for one moment but growth would not happen in life.  i got silly drunk last weekend that took some of the stress off. got to see my friends band play and see many faces i havnt seen in a long time. i miss my friends. i love them, just wish they would stop huging me when they get all sloppy hammered. damn them. back to talking about life becuase i like talking about how much life is poopy.i just wish things would change for the better one day. did you ever notice when things go bad they dont stop. for example. you could be driving on the highway at 3 am and you blow a tire, then you change the tire and need gas badly but there are no gas stations in the area so now you are lost on some exit you have never been before. then from getting lost all night you miss an apointment in the morning and so on.  this did nt happen to me but similar things do happen. when it rains it pores.i dont even know why i type in this thing people dont ever read it. it would be nice if some one did read it and maybe coment on it. any thing would be nice even if its a hey"" fuck you, your nuts, you need medication"" or maybe a hello. but whatever. im tired. and have to study for midterms tommarow. wish me luck.

"event","ok its been a while since i last entered some thing. yes everything still is poopy but thats life, what are ya gonna do? but some thing happened that scared that crap out of me, i had a wicked panic attack while driving on the highway and i thought i was gonna die, i even had to go to the hospital. i had some crazy chest pains and i got all hot and sweaty. its funny how god some times makes people suffer who have already been suffering all of their lives.  yeah i know this sounds like another whiny why me why me but seriously, why the fuck me? is there some kind of fucking eternal award for suffering or some thing? i dont know but what ever enough about that. i just hope there is seriously nothing wrong with me medically. that would be the icing on the cake. here ya go- a live full of pain and suffering and then, a serious medical problem. that would be fucking amazing!!!"

"event","hello again, it has been a while, and once again i feel the need to express my pathetic feelings just becuase.....

once again feeling the pain of this long winter cold. alone, not living but existing,so fed up with the stupidity of others, wondering of this world will one day be driven and run my morons, i keep feeling like my life is amounting to nothing, every day struggling to do what? i do not know. trying to survive in this corporate world where you are only valued by how much you make a year. feeling like i will one day fall off of the earth because people like me ar not wealthy so we are forgotten. well fuck them, fuck you! and fuck every one!!! existence means nothing to me if the world is changing in this manner. why suffer to be something your not nor made to be? why put your neck out on the line just to be cut? as in saying this i leave.. in hopes of one day feeling the glow of happiness and one day enjoying this filthy rotten earth!!"

"event","Wedding planning has been, and continues to be, so much fun!  I seriously get so excited with each new thing completed.  The wedding is slowly approaching and June will be here before we know it!  I can't wait to marry the man that God created me for.  

The most recent things that have been completed are: last week I chose our cakes!!!  I talked with Tom about it a week or so before and he knew what I was choosing and liked it, so he wont be in the dark!  Today I booked our amazing hotel for our amazing honeymoon!  It's going to be the best!!   

It's beyond anything I could have ever dreamnt about.  Planning me and Tom's wedding is so wonderful and I can't wait for the day to get here so that I can marry the most amazing man.  I can't wait to call him my husband!!  

I always try and remind myself that even though it's hard being apart from Tom during this time, seeing him is going to be well worth the wait!  

123!!!

And if the excitement of the wedding isn't enough (4 months away) the thoughts of our amazing homecoming in two is enough to make me feel like the most blessed woman in the whole world.  

2 months!!"

"event","<p>We had a scare today.&nbsp; We thought that we lost one of the six Marines that went over with Tom.&nbsp; All I could do was break down and pray that it wasn't one of our men.&nbsp; Just beg over and over that it wasn't one of&nbsp;them.&nbsp; All I could do was thank God because we knew that Tom was ok.&nbsp; I knew he was safe, but hearing that one of his men could have been killed last night was more than I ever wanted to think about.&nbsp; We now know that it was not one of six Marines and it is one of the biggest reliefs I have felt in a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are all close, us Marine girls' know the men that went over, heck there are only six that left with his unit, the thought of one of them not making it back is a horrible feeling.&nbsp; Deployments are not fun.&nbsp; They are not easy.&nbsp; I would never wish the feelings that you feel upon anyone.&nbsp; No one will ever understand what it is like either.&nbsp; I wish it was just missing him, but it's not.&nbsp; I would rather have him safe somewhere and not be able to see him for a year+ over having him deployed to a combat zone for six months.&nbsp; The feelings are indescribable.&nbsp; Some people try and say that they know, but no one knows till it happens.&nbsp; It's a feeling of helplessness, it's not being able to sleep for nights on end because you lay awake wondering if they are safe.&nbsp; You keep your phone on you all the time, even if it's going to the bathroom or to shower.&nbsp; Phone calls are prescious, emails and aim conversations are worth more than anything anyone could ever offer you.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have days where you would give anything just to have them home safe and to not have to do 'this' anymore, but then you are reminded that you would do it over and over again all because you truly love them.&nbsp; I don't want anyone to ever have to know what it feels like to have a boyfriend, fiance, husband, brother, sister, etc...over in a combat zone.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's hard.&nbsp; It's not for people who give up easy.&nbsp; It's one of the hardest things you will ever have to do.&nbsp; The goodbyes suck, being scared leaves you feeling empty, being alone is something you wish you werent, but the homecomings are amazing.&nbsp; You learn to not take for granted being able to simply call each other, you see just how prescious a hug and a kiss is.&nbsp; And simply knowing that they are sleeping sound is one of the biggest gifts ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Tomorrow is Veteran's Day.&nbsp; Even if you don't support the war, remember our troops that serve, that have serve.&nbsp; Remember all those that have given their lives in the past for us.&nbsp; Support our troops, our brave men and women who are strong enough to put their lives on the line for us, for a cause that they believe in.&nbsp; Happy Veteran's Day.&nbsp; God Bless all of our troops.</p>"

"event","So I have started subbing and I can already rule out that I do NOT want to teach pre-schoolers, middle schoolers, or special ed....just not my specialty.&nbsp; The subbing is fun though, it's awesome getting the opportunity to work with all different age groups and grades.&nbsp; It will really help me and give me the experience I will need when I start my certification come the spring.&nbsp; So far so good.

Wedding planning is coming along and it's so much fun.&nbsp; It's helping me to keep my mind off things while Tom is deployed.&nbsp; I have finally asked all my girls to be bridesmaids and we even found a dress for them!&nbsp; So exciting, especially because the dress is so super cute...I want one!!!&nbsp; My next order of business is DJ and photographer...both are going to expensive :/&nbsp; Oh well, we want our wedding to be amazing so it's worth it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This time apart from Tom sucks.&nbsp; It never gets easy, no matter how many deployments one has been through...
I am focusing on planning an amazing future for us though, starting with an amazing wedding, then it'll be to get some things to furnish our beautiful duplex.&nbsp; Of course I am also focusing on improving myself.&nbsp; I am trying to be a more positive person and more responsible.&nbsp; It's so different knowing that in 8 months we are getting married and we are merging two lives together. It's not just dating, it's the biggest step that we both could ever take.&nbsp; We are very excited and know that we are both extremely blessed to have such a wonderful opportunity.&nbsp; I can't wait to call him my husband...no more fiance..I want to say I love my HUSBAND!&nbsp; Soon!!&nbsp; Also, I have been working out.&nbsp; I have trouble getting started so this time I got a personal trainer for 6 weeks.&nbsp; And let me tell you...it pays off!&nbsp; I have been working with her for not even a week and I have already improved on my endurance and lost 5 pounds!&nbsp; I eat pretty much what I want, as long as I watch my calorie entake and then workout.&nbsp; I do both cardio and weight training, both which are key factors if you want to have any kind of improvement.&nbsp; Doing just one or the other will not get the same results as doing both.&nbsp; I still have my trainer for 5 more weeks and I am anxious to see what happens!&nbsp;&nbsp;

I want to take a trip to C.S some weekend in the near future.&nbsp; I haven't been there since the beginning of August and I do miss my Aggies!&nbsp; Plus I want to hit up N.G :)&nbsp; It's been too long...
I need to look into taking a trip!!

Well, I guess that's about it for now.&nbsp; The biggest thing is that&nbsp;I am trying to stay positive&nbsp; and busy.&nbsp; I miss my baby so much but it's worth it because when he gets back we will be husband and wife!&nbsp;&nbsp;

Hope that everyone is doing well with school, work, life.
Talk to you all later~"

<p>So of course I am going to mention something about seeing Tom because well...it's only 6 days away now!&nbsp; He was originally only going to be home from the 2nd till the 10th before he deployed but now it got extended and he will be here till the 16th!&nbsp; Two whole weeks with him!&nbsp; He's been away since May which is WAY too long and I haven't seen him in two months, so these two weeks are going to be amazing, and especially right before he leaves for Iraq!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size=""4"">6 DAYS!!!!!</font></p>
<p>You want to know what I think is absolutely great?!&nbsp; The fact that tomorrow is the first day that the little college kids go back to school and I don't have to!&nbsp; It's quite nice knowing that I don't have to worry about buying books, whether or not my prof is a good one, if my classes are managable, or if I will pass as hard class because I am a grad!!&nbsp; It's awesome.&nbsp; I will soon be incharge of little students but never again, or at least for a VERY long time, will I go back and have to go back to school to study!!!&nbsp; </p>
<p>This time off has been pretty awesome.&nbsp; The wedding planning is def. into full swing and I can't wait for 10 months for now (well maybe I can because I still have to finish planning!!!).&nbsp; I think here this week I may be going to look at and try on some dresses...YAY!!!&nbsp; Wedding plannning is quite fun, especially when you have amazing family and friends willing to help out.&nbsp; I can't wait for the big day!&nbsp; I love that I get to marry the man that I know that God made just for me!&nbsp; HOw awesome is that?!&nbsp; Amazing.</p>
<p>Well, for all those starting school this week...GOOD-LUCK!&nbsp; Have fun!&nbsp; I will be sleeping in and looking at dresses!</p>"

the one where I wake up and I'm alive. 
Just as the four walls close me within, 
my eyes are opened up with pure sunlight. 
I'm the first to know, 
my dearest friends, 
even if your hope has burned with time, 
anything that's dead shall be re-grown, 
and your vicious pain, your warning sign, 
you will be fine. 

Hey, oh, here I am, 
and here we go, life's waiting to begin. 

Any type of love - it will be shown, 
like every single tree reach for the sky. 
If you're gonna fall, 
I'll let you know, 
that I will pick you up 
like you for I, 
I felt this thing, 
I can't replace. 
Where everyone was working for this goal. 
Where all the children left without a trace, 
only to come back, as pure as gold, 
To recite this all. 

Hey, oh, here I am, 
and here we go, life's waiting to begin. 
Tonight, 
hey, oh, here I am, 
and here we go, life's waiting to begin. 
Tonight, 
hey, oh, here I am, 
and here we go, life's waiting to begin. 

I cannot live, I can't breathe 
unless you do this with me 
I cannot live, I can't breathe 
unless you do this with me 
I cannot live, I can't breathe 
unless you do this with me 
I cannot live, I can't breathe 
unless you do this with me 
I cannot live, I can't breathe 
unless you do this with me 
I cannot live, I can't breathe 
unless you do this with me 

Hey, oh, here I am, 
and here we go, life's waiting to begin. 
Hey, oh, here I am. 
And here we go, life's waiting to begin, 
life's waiting to begin

"event","It's been so long since I updated.  I read the last post and it was neat because I was talking how excited I was to be getting my Aggie Ring...wait, rather, EARNING my Aggie RIng...well it's beautiful and my right hand would be rather lonely without it!  

The biggest news of all of course is that my left hand is NOT so lonely anymore...Tom proposed!  It was beautiful and special and I was so surprised.  I honestly thought that I would be able to tell, but he got me.  Go him!  I love calling him my fiance and knowing that in 368 days (yeah, I have a countdown...this day is WAY too important not too!! Besides now that we have a date set, why the heck not!!) we will be married!  I miss him so much right now though, he had to leave for training, he ships out for Iraq at the end of August which is going to be so hard, but knowing that I get to plan OUR wedding while he's gone...well, the wait will be worth it, hard as hell...but worth it.  He's the most amazing, caring, man in the world...I know that a lot of people say that about those they love, but he truly finds a way to amaze me EVERYDAY...there's never a day that goes by that he doesn't tell me how much he loves me and show me just as much.  Truly a blessing sent straight from God.  

I could spend the entire entry talking about my amazing FIANCE but I will move on...lol!  

So I am at A&M for the summer finishing up my last hours of college...EVER, there will be no going back.  I look forward to graduating, I have worked my butt off for 4 years and now it will pay off.  I know quite a few people that aren't going to be graduating on time (but then again I think I know more that are), and really...the way I look at it, if you work hard and go to class and stay updated with advisors and whatnot, it's totally possible to graduate May or August of your graduating year.  I have had to retake classes, sadly...but what I learned from that is that you have to go no matter what, which sucks at times because there have been many times when I wanted to be with Tom or in Arlington with my buddies...but in the end it's worth it...work hard and the pay off is graduation!!

These past few months have been crazy really.  To me, they have sort of been God's way of showing me that if you perservere and try you hardest, despite trying times, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  I worked hard to stay up with my hours, I got my Aggie Ring, I stuck out some classes that I thought I could never complete, but I kept it up and graduation is right around the corner, Tom and I have been through so much seperation but we trusted and knew that God would provide during our times apart, and now we are engaged to be married in a year.  

All these blessings are great, still in the middle of some really tough times, taking my last classes, being away from the man I love more than anything in this world, and being away from family and friends, but I just try and remind myself that I can do it.  Things are hard, if they weren't hard then people wouldn't appreciate the blessings.  Some things do not come easy...but when things do come to you after time of struggles...you realize have truly blessed you are, despite hard times.

P e r s e r v e r e.
T r u s t.

I just gotta stay strong even though there are times when it's hard and I don't feel very strong..."

The apartment is SOOO clean, I seriously spent over 3 hours cleaning it today.  I just hope that it can stay that way, at least through the week and with my guest coming in on Friday.  I will probally have to do a little cleaning later in the week but nothing like today.

Tom comes in on Thursday!
I get my ring on Thursday...WHOOP!
So many fun people are coming in Friday for the dunking! WHOOP!"

"event","It's Wednesday and surprisingly this week is going by quickly...which I love because I can't wait to see Tom and my little bro!
I have a Spanish test today which I feel awesome about because I studied a lot on Monday and Tuesday for it.  
I started working yesterday and I love it.  It's super easy and it goes by fast and they are laid back which is awesome.

Tomorrow Matt and I are doing Aggie Wrangler dance lessons and I am excited to learn more two stepping moves!  I am going to teach Tom and then he will know and we will be awesome!

The whole thought of Tom going back has sunk in finally.  There's still times when I start to tear up about the thought of it but all in all I know that he's going over with some awesome men and I just pray that the seven plus months goes by fast.  We wanted to get married in September like most had hear, but seeing as he wont be here that wont happen...but when he gets back in Spring of '07 (that's what we hear, depending on when he deploys) we are getting married asap!  We are just ready to settle down and truly become one in marriage.  I know so many people that think simply living together or dating someone is what is awesome and brings people close, but I know that when God unites two people in marriage is when it is truly amazing and a wonderful blessing.  I am so thankful that God has put such an incredibly strong, good-hearted man in my life.  I couldn't imagine dating someone who didn't always strive to be a good person and strive to help me become a better person.  What a blessing this man is!

Ok, that was my tangent about the man I love and now on to school...
Well it sucks, really, I am so ready to be done and it's looking like August is becoming a more definite time for me to graduate afterall.  I went and spoke to my advisor and they said I was doing awesome and right now track to graduate in Aug...and as I walked out they congratulated me!  I was confused but they said congrats on working hard and completing all that I have and actually graduating on time...craziness.  I still don't feel it's real, which I suppose that there is always a chance it could be Dec, but for the sole fact that they congratulated me, well...let's just say it's a lot to take in!

I can't wait until the 27th!  I get my Aggie Ring!  Finally, all the hours of school work are seeming to pay off with my graduation date getting closer and finally receiving my ring!  BIG WHOOP to that!!!!!  My grandparents and Tom are coming down that day for me to get it and then Friday I am working with others to plan my ring-dunking/Chris' late 21st party and it's going to rock!  A place has been set, who is coming has started, and what will be there, well that will happen closer to the date.  Then of course Saturday is ring dance.  I haven't gotten tickets yet, which I should probally do but I am so excited that I get to show off Tom in his dress blues, he's such a HOT Marine and I can't wait to show him off at the dance ;)

Ok, for now it's rest time and then back to the library to study some more and then test time.

Goodluck to everyone who has tests this week!

Grant me the strength to get through this once again...."

"event","It was a good weekend, wish it wasn't over.  Tom came over Saturday after his Austin test; I am so glad that he was able to come and visit, especially since we just found out about him going back to Iraq.  We had tons to talk about and of course we needed some alone time.  It postpones a lot of our plans, but like we both feel in our hearts, everything happens for a reason and so if plans must be postponed then we trust.  
He had to go back this morning...which sucks.  I don't want to be without him ever and now when we are apart is hurts even more because I know that soon we are going to be apart for 7 or so months.
I love that man so much and am so blessed to get to have him in my life.  He makes me so proud with all that he does.  I admire that man, he is awesome!
Ok, time for a quick nap and then off to campus to study."

"event","He's going back...


It hurts like hell right about now.  I have so many things I am feeling, things that remind me of the first time he left and how sick I felt then...
 
This song sort of sums it up I guess.  Please keep him in your prayers, he doesn't leave for a couple months but the prayers will help I know:


""Stand Back Up"" SugarLand

Go ahead and take your best shot,
Let 'er rip, give it all you've got,
I'm laid out on the floor, but I've been here before,
I may stumble, yeah I might fall,
Only human aren't we all?
I might lose my way, but hear me when I say,

I will stand back up,
You'll know just the moment when I've had enough,
Sometimes I'm afraid, and I don't feel that tough,
But I'll stand back up,

I've been beaten up and bruised,
I've been kicked right off my shoes,
Been down on my knees more times than you'd believe,
When the darkness tries to get me,
There's a light that just won't let me,
It might take my pride, and my tears may fill my eyes,
But I'll stand back up,

I've weathered all these storms,
But I just turn them into wind, so I can fly,
What don't kill you makes you stronger,
When I take my last breath,
That's when I'll just give up,

So, go ahead and take your best shot,
Let 'er rip, give it all you've got,
You might win this round but you can't keep me down,

'Cause I'll stand back up,
And you'll know just the moment when I've had enough,
Sometimes I'm afraid and I don't feel that tough,
But I'll stand back up,

You'll know just the moment when I've had enough,
Sometimes I'm afraid and I don't feel that tough,
But I'll stand back up."

"event","Well, first off...Disney World was INCREDIBLE!  It was such an amazing trip and it went far better than I could have ever thought.  I loved all the parks: Epcot(most of all!!!), Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, and MGM(second fav.). Tom and I had so much fun with his family.  It was so great seeing everyone again and getting to spend an entire week with them, especially because some are so far away from us.  It was really magical!  No joke...I am a huge advocate for it.  The employees are all super nice always (crazy!) and the park is so clean all the time.  I really liked Epcot because I liked the around the world part.  All the different sections from the different parts of the world, ie: Germany, Japan, England, France, Italy...etc, had the buildings made to look just like those from those countries and the food was authentic and the things to buy too, the people are from the countries (they come in for certain amounts of time and work for disney), the greenery was flown from the countries so the plants and flowers are those that have been grown in the countries also.  It was just awesome...fav dinner was Germany...Good food, good beer, and good company!  It was so amazing, the entire trip, we stayed in one of Disney's resorts and we pampered the whole time.  I am pretty sure that I will talk more about it later...for now all I really need to say is that it was amazing and I am so thankful that I got to go.

Second AMAZING news...Chris is in Legune!!!  He made it to North Carolina on Monday...how incredible.  I seriously had a huge rock lifted off my chest, I felt like I could really be excited and not worry anymore.  It was a good feeling.  A feeling that unfortunately didn't last long...

Last news that I heard that has kept me holding back tears since yesterday is that Tom recieved word that he is on standby to leave for Iraq.  I can't believe it.  By the end of this week we will know for sure if he goes or doesn't go.  He called me and told me yesterday, I got that knot in my stomach that I had the when I found out about him leaving the first time and that stayed there the entire time that he was gone.  So many of the fears that I haven't felt in so long came rushing back.  I didn't get to get excited about Chris too much and that really hurts, because now I am worried that Tom may be going back.  Tom and I have talked a lot about it, everything happens for a reason.  We are  both trying to be optimistic and not think too much of it until we know. I am really trying to be strong and not think about it too much because we don't know anything just yet.  But it is hard.  It's really hard.  I feel sick to my stomach once agian and there is nothing that I can do.
Give me the strength I need...


I love him so much and pray that he isn't needed and is able to stay."

"event","It has been quite awhile since I've last updated.  Tons of fun things and not so fun things have gone on in between then and now, but I have been so busy that I didn't really have time to update.  This update however is dedicated totally to Aggie Awakening 76!

Aggie Awakening for those of you that don't know, is this retreat that St.Mary's puts on and is open to anyone who is interested.  I have heard awesome things about this retreat since before my Freshman year, so many people told me to go and that I would love it.  Well, as you can see I waited quite awhile before I went, my senior year!!!!  You sigh up a few weeks in advanced and since there are always so many people who want to go they do a random drawing and then your name either goes on the list, the waiting list, or neither.  Matt, Brian and Morgan all got on the list and I of course was number 117 on the WAITING LIST!  I was so bummed.  I really wanted to go and it was looking like I wouldn't be going because I was so far down and so many people wanted to go.  Well, I have amazing friends, some that I have just met this year, an amazing brother, and of course the best boyfriend ever; they all either called or talked to those running the retreat and explained that I was senior and that I was really wanting to go.  It came down to, them all saying just show up that day and that they wouldn't turn me down.  So basically I was going to get to go but just by showing up....which I guess is better than not going.  Through the weeks I almost decided not to go because I thought that if I wasn't on the list then I wasn't suppose to go.  I even thought that I wouldn't miss anything really.  

Friday, of the retreat, rolled around and I decided that I would just go and see what happens.  Well, that morning I was running around all crazy trying to get hw done, packing, insurance, rent, etc. all done before I left for the retreat and around 130 or 2 I got called from the people in charge of A.A and they asked me to come, I had some how made the list, officiall!!!  This was awesome to me, I wasn't going to just have to show up and hope that they would take me but now I was on the list.  Somehow I mananaged to get all my stuff done before 3 and I headed to campus to meet Matt and Brian.  We all went to the church and signed up and got ready.

To be honest when we met with everyone and waited while they loaded the busses, I thought that this retreat would be good, not the best, but good.  Because, afterall I had been to so many retreats, I had helped put on so many retreats!!  I was skeptical, but open.  I wanted to see what so many people had talked about.

Friday-Sunday was amazing.  The retreat opened my eyes to so many things, so many new things and so many things that I had lost site of.  I would love to go into detail about every little thing that occured but I wont, because I know that there are some Ags( and future Ags!!!) that read this and I don't want to give away a thing.  All I can say is that this retreat is something unlike anything that I have ever experienced, absolutely original.  It honestly doesn't matter how many retreats that you have been on, this one is something that is so unique and such an awesome way to approach the whole retreat idea.  I loved it!  I met so many wonderful people, some of those which I know I will only get closer to.  We are all already meeting again later this week and I can't wait.  It was so amazing.  God is truly amazing.  It's one of those things, just offer it up and trust that God will put you where he wants you.  I know that I was suppose to be there this weekend and I can't be any more thankful that I didn't give in to my own stubborness and went.  

I think that too many times we all try and take matters in to our own hands, like what we will do or whatnot, and then things get crazy and we become overwhelmed.  We forget that God wants us to be happy and that He really puts us everywhere we need to be, or in situations that He knows that we can handle.  When we truly allow ourselves to trust God's Will for our lives we learn to be truly happy.  Happiness and joy are two things that God wants for us.  When we trust, we obtain these.  Yes, we may struggle and fall, but ultimately we know that God will not let us stay down for long...
I've met some people this last weekend that are truly happy with themselves and their lives, and even if they may not know when they will graduate, if they will be married or what they will do upon graduating, they are happy because they know that right now is where they are suppose to be.

I think that I am going to try and really balance my faith and my fun times.  You know, like going out with my girls or friends and having a blast is a wonderful thing and I wouldn't change that, but I also need to try and incorporate in more time for prayer, like adoration or daily mass.  I guess, this is something that I am going to try and work on through lent.  
Yeah, good times...

Countdown Fun:
5days till home
7days till Disney World
17days till Switchfoot Concert (with some of my favorite people!!)
52days till I get my Aggie Ring...WHOOP!"

He</font> usually can only stay one night but this time he had it to where it would be longer! I cleaned the apartment this weekend so when he got here it would be spotless...I vacuumed the living room and my bedroom, scrubbed my bathroom and the kitchen and pretty much cleaned everything up. It of course never lasts long, I already am planning on cleaning again tomorrow for Mags arrival on Friday!&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyways, back to the amazing visit. Since he couldn't be here with me on V-day we celebrated these last couple of days. He got in Sunday and we went to mass and then to this authentic mexican food restuarant on Texas, it was so good. Then we went and rented a movie and watched it and relaxed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Monday I went to class and then afterwards he and I went to the rec and workout, it was so freaking <font color=""#3366ff"">awesome.</font> We did our workout and then walked a mile as a cool down and it was so wonderful having him there with me! Then we had some lunch and were going to go and grab some coffee before daily mass but got side tracked by the <font color=""#3366ff"">indoor shooting range.&nbsp; </font>We went in to get prices and ended up staying and shooting! <font color=""#3366ff"">My first time ever to shoot, a 9mm </font>and it was so freaking fun! Quite empowering!!! :) Then him, Matt and I went to Rudy's for some beer and bbq. I don't normally like bbq but this time it was pretty good and the atmosphere was so laid back and fun. Afterwards TOm and I went for some dollar margaritas at Ozonas. They were good and cheap and the company was amazing, so all in all...fun!!! Later that night we went to N.G to meet with some friends and drank a couple more drinks and Tom and I played pool. Then I had to sleep because of class the next morning.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yesterday Tom took me to class and then he and I went and grabbed lunch in Mary's section which was fun. Afterwards we were so tired from staying out late the night before we took a nice nap. Then we went grocery shopping so that I could get some things for dinner, I made him chicken parmesan. He said he liked it which is all that matters, even though it didn't turn out quite like I had expected.&nbsp;I really try and make at least one really good meal for him when he is in town, sort of me practicing for when we get married and I get to cook for him!&nbsp; <br /><br />He left early this morning which sucked, after such an incredible week with lots of <font color=""#3366ff"">hugs</font>, <font color=""#3366ff"">kisses</font>, <font color=""#3366ff"">laughing</font> and<font color=""#3366ff""> fun</font> ;it of course was not so fun to see him go. But it is worth it. It gets me excited about when we will be married and get to be with each other all the time, it's going to be incredible!&nbsp;&nbsp;What an&nbsp;incredible feeling to be 22 and know that we have found that one person that we&nbsp;get to spend the rest of our life with.&nbsp;<br />So all in all...this Valentine's celebration with my baby was the best ever: <br /><font color=""#993300"">-Awesome gifts from one of my fav. stores <br /></font><font color=""#0000ff"">-He taught me how to shoot a gun which was so awesome.</font> <br /><font color=""#ff0000"">-Kisses and hugs all the time</font> <br /><font color=""#ff00ff"">-Numerous dinner dates <br /></font><font color=""#339966"">-Dancing <br /></font><font color=""#800080"">-Staying Sun-Wed</font>&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />What more could I have asked for...he spoils me,<font color=""#3366ff""> I am so blessed</font>! It's incredible, when he looks at me or says that he loves me it's so amazing and I am reminded constantly that he was made just for me and i was made just for him. Our love is continuing to grow and that in itself just blows my mind away. It's truly amazing what happens when you just <font color=""#3366ff"">trust.</font> <br /><br />Awesome week thus far. Tonight is going to be full of studying however because of these things called exams that I have tomorrow. Oh well, these last few days will def. get me through the stresses of school this week. <br /><br /><font color=""#ff6600"">Disney World countdown:19days <br /></font><font color=""#993300"">Aggie Ring day countdown:64 days</font> <br /><br /><br /><br />God Bless our troops.

"event","I'm glad that I have no more test this week and that I don't have any major assignments due either.  Time to get organized and other things that I have been putting off.
This week has been full of highs and lows.  Monday I honestly felt like I was dealt every bad hand in the book and I didn't think that I could make it through the week if I heard of one more thing not going as planned or one more crappy thing that was happening.  Yeah, Monday pretty much sucked.  Well, up until I went in to take my Spanish test, right before I went in I was talking with Tom and going off on how I felt so overwhelmed and so lost, then I sat and listened to him say just offer it up and trust.  Things I say a lot but sometimes forget to actually do in certain situations.  So I did, I said that I trusted and even though all these not so wonderful things that were happening to me, I told myself that God would provide and He wouldn't leave me hanging.  So I got off the phone with Tom feeling somewhat better and walked into my class.  Test was cancelled.  It was crazy!!  I was so excited to know that I got off early and that I didn't have the test.  It was wonderful, the first good thing of the day.  After that it kept getting better because I went back to my apt and got things ready for the V-day party that the girls were throwing.  The party was so much fun, the food was great, the company was fun, all in all the night was so much fun.  Oh yes, girls night with lots of fun girls and Mike, the only guy, but it's all good because he's awesome and makes the best valentines!  
Yesterday was V-day and it's kinda crappy having your valentine 3 hours away and working all day...but it's all good because he's going to be visiting soon and it will be for longer than a day and we will have our awesome v-day celebration!  I can't wait!!  Patience.  He sent me a dozen red roses and one pink gerber daisy in the middle (because he's awesome like that and knows it's my fav!) and I got a beautiful rose from Danielle.  I would have loved to have had him with me but he's gotta work and so it's ok.  Soon enough.
Got stuff to do now.
Adios"

Hmm...well I guess I will start with Thursday because it was so freaking awesome!!!  Thursday I went to the Wideawake concert with Mary and some of her lacrosse sisters and Matt and Brian.  It was SOOOO much fun!!  I loved being at a concert where it was small and laid back (back of Fitz's)!  We drank a little and sang and danced and just had a good time not worrying about anything.  It was crazy, I needed that night out with crazy people to just let loose and have fun.  After the concert Matt and Brian left because they had early classes and Mary and I joined Danielle and Drew at The Library.  Not too shabby, it's a pretty fun place to hang out.  Then we went back to the apartment and were up eating and talking and being dumb till about 4!  It was so much fun!!!!

Friday I went home had a blast being home with Tom and my family.  I got to see Mags for a short bit, but it's all could cause she's most likely coming down this weekend.  The family is great and Tom's family is starting to talk about how much crazy fun we will have during spring break in Disney World...i can't wait!!!  Sunday was sad.  Sad because the weekend had gone by way to fast and I was having to pack up and head back to C.S and I didn't want to just yet.  I miss Tom a lot.  He's going to be visiting very soon so I can't dwell on the fact that we can't be together right now, but soon!!!  

Lots has happened in the last couple of days to stress me out.  Personal issues I suppose.  I feel worn out and stressed and I want to try and take it slow and get everything done that I need to and just remember how blessed I am.  I know that I am blessed and I think maybe that's what keeps me going when times get tough.  But I have an amazing man in my life, amazing friends and family!  

Today I have a test at 415 and then I get to relax and make Valentines and Valentine bags for everyone and the party tonight.  I am so glad the girls came up with this idea, it's such a cute idea.  Plus, after yesterday and today a little party tonight will be much needed!  Well I guess I will go and watch tv till my lovely alarm sounds for me to begin my day.

It's been a busy one but also a really fun one.  Lots of dates with the ladies which is always fuN!
I am really excited about Monday night's Valentines Day party.  I think it's such a cute idea to get a group of girls together to celebrate (well plus one boy) and have fun.  We are even bring Valentines for everyone and putting them in little lunch bags with our names on them.  We have about 10 people coming and I am in charge of decorating their little V-day bags.  It reminds me of Elementary school!  It should be fun!
Well today I had my Math test, not too bad.  I am just glad that it's done with and I don't have to worry about it for awhile.  I only have one more class and then I am off to finish filling out paper work for my new job...hopefully I will have a fairly regular schedule by next week.  I am going to like working on campus though because they work with you class schedule.
Oh yeah, Mary and I are going to go and see WideAwake tonight.  They are awesome and I can't wait.  I just hope that she doesn't have too much studying to do so that she doesn't feel badly about going.  Also Chris said that he's going to try and call me tonight which is awesome because I haven't talked to him in forever.
Well time to relax before I have class in an hour.
Adios for now.

Only Monday and this week has been awesome.
I don't exactly have amazing things to talk about as to why it's been such a good week thus far, I think it's partly due to the fact that I came off such an amazing fun weekend and it's seems to be continuing or something!

Today was awesome.  Something that I am realizing is that I have amazing friends and of course an amazing family, and last but NOT least(first really!!) is my baby!!! Tom is amazing and does so much for me, more than he probally will ever even realize that he does for me.  He's truly God sent and I am so thankful to have such an incredible (and waaaaaay good-looking) man in my life! Next, it's so awesome to have Matt down here, having family that close to talk to and hang out with anytime you need to is pretty awesome, plus hopefully Chris will be here soon enough!
Then the other thing that I am realizing is just how amazing my friends are...my Aggie buddies and my buddies from back home.  It's sort of bittersweet, I am growing so freaking close to my Aggie buddies down here that the thought of graduating is sort of bittersweetness.  I am just loving all the crazy times that we have, well crazy times and the laid back times also.  LIke tonight for instance Mary, Danielle and Jenn were over at their apt. eating and relaxing and catching up and so when I got out of my review I went over there and spent the remainder of the night hanging out with those crazy chicas.  I just know that times like that are going to be missed when I am a college grad. and whatnot.  Plus I am getting to know so many other kids down here that it's making this semester that much greater...
Also, I am looking forward to the much anticipated, much talked about, girls night.  ""Valentines breakfast for dinner"" party sounds like quite the perfect time to have a ladies night.  Hopefully I don't work so that I can help make some good food!!

I miss my friends from back home (they are so wonderful!) and am thankful for the ones that I got down here.  

Ok, so yeah, I went off about how awesome friends are.  I am just realizing a lot about friendship how I am so thankful to have such wonderful people in my life who are fun and supportive and always seem to be there in the fun times and the not so fun times.

Right now I am tired...going to bed.
I miss my baby!
I will see him soon! YAY!
Goodnight and sweetdreams to all!"

"event","This weekend has been so wonderful!  It's been fun and I absolutely loved it!  I seriously have the best friends ever and I am just glad that I got to see so many of them this weekend.

Thursday was the start of this awesome weekend.  Tom came in and I made him one of his favorite meals and desserts and then we got to just relax and enjoy being with oneanother.  Then I hung out with Mary and Danielle over at M&J's apt for a little OC night and whatnot.  Those girls are always fun and I love them!  Well then we got all dolled up and went out dancing!  It was so much fun dancing with my baby!!!  Erik came into town this weekend and it was so much fun seeing him Thursday and Friday.  It was great fun, I haven't seen that kid in forever.  Also I got to see Amber and Cassidy!  Those crazy old married people came out to The Hall and it was great to see them!  It was so much fun!  

Friday Tom and I had lunch (SUSHI!!!!) and then he had to get on the road to be back to work later that night.  It of course was hard to see him go, but we had such a wonderful time and I know that I will see him soon enough!  I love that man so much.  Well I had to work later that night which wasn't much fun but oh well...gotta earn some sort of money!  Then I came home for some poker with some crazy people and that was fun.  It's so nice to have an apartment and get to have my friends over and whatnot.  It's quite awesome really...being able to offer my friends a place to stay.  

Saturday I had to run some errands and then work at 4.  I got off a little before 10 and it was awesome because I met Erika and Erin and some other people over at The Chicken for a few drinks and pool.  It was awesome...I saw Libby, ANdrea, Hallie and Keri there too!  I haven't seen those girls in so long.  It was awesome.  The best part of the night was coming back and having a girls night with Erika and Erin.  Those girls are awesome!  We stayed up till 430 talking and just having a great time.  I already miss them already, they are just that great!!!  

Today we woke up and went to mass and then to lunch with some friends.  It was fun, always!!!  Then we came back here and they packed their stuff and had to be on the road for SEAS super bowl party.  They left and I was exhausted and Matt wasn't feeling well so he crashed here because I was too tired to drive him back and we were going to be leaving together for the super bowl party at St.Marys around 5.  So we took a nice nap and woke up and went to the super bowl party with FREE food and of course it was lots of fun.
All in all this weekend was incredible.  It was so much fun and i have such wonderful friends!  I am just glad that they were all able to come down and visit, especially Erik whom I haven't seen in FOREVER and of course two very lovely ladies that I have been missing!  

Well for now it's time to write a paper so that hopefully I can get to bed at a decent hour.  Hope that everyone's weekend was as great as mine!  
YAY for awesome friends!
YaY for having the most incredible man in my life!"

I know that I need to always do this.

Thank you God!

I offered up my situation with Tom.  I didn't know the outcome but I trusted, I knew that it would be amazing.  God proved to me that HE is watching out for me and that EVERYTHING happens for a reason.
Tom surprised me last night.
So much was discussed and so much has been revealed to us, and not because of our doing but because of HIS doing.
Thank you God.

I am a truly blessed woman. 
 
I pray that I continue to trust YOU in all aspects of my life."

I did go out and look for a job, hopefully something good will come from that.
Other than that I've been home alone, in bed, all weekend sick.  I think I have the flu or something, shivers, temp.,cough, sneezing...blah.
I for some crazy reason thought that I would go and workout yesterday, got in the car and headed to the rec, just to turn back around and get back in bed because I felt miserable.
Blah for being sick.  Hopefully all this rest will make me better."

"event","Yeah, fun times....classes are back and in full swing!  I don't know about the classes this semester, I know that SPanish and Math are going to be the toughest ones, well in the since that I have difficulty understanding them.  I have one of my senior English classes that is going to be difficult with lots of work.  But hopefully it will be ok.  I can already tell that I am so going to love two things about the semester 1)No night classes 2) 15 hours over 19 is such a huge and amazing difference!!  It's neat, I have Matt in my Math class and Dana is in my Shakespheare class.  Oh yeah, and on Mon-Wed Mary and I drive to campus together.  It's always good to have friends, Mary and I are great friends, but only on Mondays and Wednesdays! ;)  So all in all I think that this semester shouldn't be too hard, lots of work and whatnot, but not too hard.  And besides I need to remind myself that this is my last full semester here at A&M...then only a summer and I am DONE!  WHOOOP!  I also am way pumped about getting my ring, I checked my application or whatever that is that they check to make sure that you qualify and I do and I go on the 23rd to get sized and order it!  It will be nice to get it, a symbol of all the hard work that has been put in!  

Ok, what else is new.  Sherri is back.  We haven't really talked much yet, I thnk our schedules are opposite.  Plus it always takes a bit to get back into a routine and whatnot, so it's sort of expected.  I'm sure that soon enough we will get to talk and catch up.  Hmm...all my other aggie buddies are great.  I still haven't cleaned my room...well I have, I just haven't gotten the urge to put away all my clothes from the break.  I need to, it will help my room look so much better.  Maybe tonight.

Speaking of tonight Matt and I are going to meet and going to daily mass together and then he's coming over and I am cooking.  Then of course the big highlight (does this make me pathetic?!) is that LOST comes on!!!  I am so pumped about it!  Matt got me hooked because he let me watch the first season and up till the point they are at now and so I am hooked.  It's such an awesome show.  You really have to watch all the episodes from the beginning to really see just how awesome it is.  

Hmm...I miss my buddies from back home.  I miss Tom most of all (that's a given though!) and I miss my Mags and of course Erin!!  I want Becca and Mags to take a road trip here and we can have some fun...it would rock if we could also get Claire here and then we could def. have some fun!  

I talked to Tom today.  It was incredible.  We talked for so long, it had been a couple of days since we had talked last but it was worth it.  I am can see so many wonderful things that have come from this time apart..and it's only been a couple of weeks.  Don't get me wrong, it's one of the hardest things that he and I have ever done, but it's one of the best things that we could have ever done!  Our love has grown so much and God has showed us so much in these last couple of weeks.  It's amazing what will happen when you completely trust God and completely trust that things happen for a reason.  I miss talking to him all the time, he said that he has times where he just wants to jump in the car and come down and see me, but then he remembers that so many wonderful things are happening with this time apart.  Our love is growing more than either one of us could have ever dreamed, we are learning to trust in God and to be always thankful that He put us together, we are both growing so much independently and becoming such strong individuals.  Tom told me today that he's never been so sure of something in all his life...his love for me and how much he knows that we will be together until forever.  We both have discussed some of the things that we are working on individually and some of them are small and make me laugh, he laughs too, and some are deeper things.  It's beautiful.  When we see each other again our love is going to so apparent, if you crazy kids got annoyed about how much we talked about how much we loved each other before, well...it's only going to increase!  I love that man.  What a blessing he is.  How blessed I am to have him.  Thank you God!

Well, I am thinking of calling Miss Mary now and seeing if she wants to go on a walk with me.  I like walks, walks and talks are fun!  I started working out again yesterday, I feel good today.  I am going to work out at least 3 times a week.  I have been eating healthy for about a month now, you know lots of greens, non-greasy foods, fruits and veggies kind of thing and just by that alone, no working out yet, I have lost 8 pounds.  So if in just a few weeks of eating healthy my weight dropped by 8 pounds, I know that by continuing to eat healthy and working out I will def. get the results that I want.  I am already noticing that my stomach (which seems to gain ALL my extra weight!) is shrinking and I have some small definition lines.  It's great.  8 pounds down 10 to go...I can do this!

Ok, adios for now, sorry this is a bit of a novel of an entry, but it's been awhile.  Hope that everyone is having a great semester thus far.

It's nice to stay busy...I don't think about not seeing Tom as much.  
I actually called him on my way out of Arlington yesterday because it was rough leaving and whatnot.  He told me to keep being strong and doing awesome, that he loved me so much and couldn't wait to see me again.  This time is good I've decided; it's allowing him to not be distracted and get things done and believe it or not...me too!
He sent me a text message last night that said ""wont you smile for me my texas angel, it'll be alright...i love you baby!""
I love him and I can already see a change in his attitude...amazing!
He is sweet and I know that only wonderful things will come from this time apart.

"event","So I am at home right now doing laundry and slowly getting my stuff packed up and ready to head back to C.S.  I don't know what to expect really.  My feelings are a bit mixed, I've grown way comfortable with Arlington and knowing that I am minutes from Tom.  But I also know that this will be good for us because we wont be able to see each other whenever, which I know we both struggle with, especially being minutes away.  We talked today and I told him that this time is sort of like bootcamp, he was gone for a bit and the only communication was letters.  Well, this time, our communication is going to be through emails and we both like the idea of that, you know...instead of nothing!  He told me that he was so thankful that I understood that this was something that he had to do. I can already see God working in Tom's life and I am praying that He begins to transform my heart and soul also.  I know that this is only one of the first few days and I know that it's only going to get even more amazing.  Tom and I have to remember to keep praying.  
I guess I'll end with a quote that my little brother had in his email, I found it so perfect:

""The biggest Act of Love one Human Being can show to another Human being, 
                          is to encourage them and draw them closer Christ."""

I admire that man and love him more now than ever because he was man enough to see himself not at a place to help himself or me or us.  I love him so much and know that this time will only bring us closer to God and closer together.  What more could one ask for?
I love him so much.  He reminds me constantly of his love for me. 
Thank you God.

And like Tom says to me constantly, ""i love you always and forever and not one day less...""
and boy do I love him now more than ever!"

"event","So Tom and I talked for a good long while.
This is what was concluded:
-We need this time apart right now to grow stronger individually.
-We love each other and this is something that is contant.
-We look forward to coming back together because then it will be when we are both ready for it.
-We'll talk here and there and keep each other updated.

I guess all this doubt that I have had these last couple of days was me worrying and not just trusting.  I know now that he hasn't does this to hurt me, he still wished more than anything that we could still be together, but that right now we must do this because we both deserve the best.  I agree.  It's still hard.  I want to call him always and see him on the weekends...but I know that this will help me grow stronger in areas that I've been lacking...like my faith.  

I love him and can't wait till we can embrace again.  What I have learned is that love is constant...you shouldn't doubt, just trust."

"event","I have had a good day today...struggling with so many different emotions.  One thing that I saw that I was doing was that I was hoping 1)that shortly Tom and I will get back together or 2)that if we aren't meant to be together that I realize that God has something even more amazing for me.  The thing that was hurting me with ""hoping"" in these two things was that I was placing limitations of my hope.  Hope is not that at all.  Hope, like Matt has so beautifully stated to me, should be when you hope for what is best.  Simple as that.  Saying that calms me down.  I also realize that Tom did this for a reason, he needs time to work things out and if I spend this whole time freaking out about ""what if's"" and ""what not's"" then I am not using this time properly.  I am not allowing myself to grow.  It's hard and sometimes I lose focus and find myself doubting and not trusting...but then I try and remember that God is in control.  
I must hope for what is best.  
Hope in God."

"event","I must continue to trust God. 
I feel in my heart that Tom is truely and amazing man and it hurts me to see him struggle so with things in his life and feel that he needs to not have me right now to figure things out.  This is the best thing for the both of us; I don't deserve to be in a relationship where a person gives only part of themselves to me and he deserves to be in a relationship where he feels he can give all of himself to me.  I know that God has great plans for us and I still feel with prayer that God will bring us both back together when the time is right.  Tom even says that right now he can't be with me, that right now he has so many doubts and confusions about a lot of things in his lfe.  He says that he doesn't really deserve a relationship right now in his life and that causes him to doubt.  Doubting is understandable, especially when you fee lost.  I love that man so much and I confidently hold my head up and continue on, not giving up on him or on us, and knowing that God has done all of this for some greater reason that I may not see completely right now.
I love him so.
Please will everyone pray for him that he starts this process, of growing and trying to better understand his life, with an open heart and trust and also that he begins to see that he can talk to people, not me necessarily, but others, to help him out in his times of need.  God give him the strength to always do your will.

I am only human right now...I feel hurt, I feel pain and uncertainty.  But in the midst of all this I know that I am a strong woman who, throughout the pain, can confidently say that I know that God has amazing plans for me."

"event","Yeah.  Trusting is all I can do at this point.  I know that this is what is best, it's just hard...harder than anything I've ever done in my life.  He's not himself; he's not a good person right now and he needs to figure things out.  Even though this means us not being together at this time or whenever...then it has to be done.  I deserve better.  It's the most bitter sweet thing that has ever happened to me.  He loves me and I him, he is just confused right now.  He's not the person he truly was made to be and in effect it is hurting me and him and others.  He says that he can't be with me...he says that it has to not be with so that he can figure things out for himself.  And that's fine, I respect that.  It just hurts like hell.  I trust God.  I trust that He knows that we can't be together right now because He has to let him realize that he has become someone that is not him.  
I feel hopeful.
I feel scared.
I completely trust.
I feel so alone.

Last night was awesome!  I went over to Mary and Jenn's and there was a group of about 8 or so girls and we had a girls night.  It was fun!  We drank fancy girl drinks (I drank some beer too...gotta have my beer!!) and watched Dukes of Hazzard.  Then Mary and I left and went over to one of her buddies 21st birthday.  It was fun, we played some cards and hung out!  I got to be some of her infamous lacrosse little sisters...good times.  
Hehehe...Mary you make me laugh, especially when the car was swirving by the cop and you got nervous!! Dumb foggy windows!  

Now I am at work waiting for the little ones to get home from school.  This may be my last day to work for them...kinda sad.  But only kinda because I wasn't really making any money at all! Plus I can come and visit them next year so it's all good.

After work I am off to be Matt's date!  His hospital is throwing a Christmas dinner party at some fancy restaraunt and I get to be Matt's guest!  Heck yes for free food!!  

I am looking forward to going home Saturday.  Friday will most likey be a top-secret mission which I love everytime! I can't wait to see all my family and friends and especially Tom!

"event","<P>I am at work right now and it's great because the kids are relaxing and reading!&nbsp; Quiet time for me!&nbsp; YAY!&nbsp; I am going to go and get the last of my Aggie friends' Christmas presents after this.&nbsp; I only have like two more to get and then I am done!&nbsp; Tom and I still have tons of shopping to do when I get home next weekend, but it will be fun because I will be with him!&nbsp; </P>
<P>I've been hanging out a lot at Mary and Jenn's and it's been fun times!&nbsp; Danielle is usually over there and she always makes the night a little more interesting with her stories and plots!&nbsp; Those girls are great and I am glad that they are right around the corner to hang out with.&nbsp; I have their gifts already, I just need to get stuff to wrap them with.&nbsp; Mary and I broke and I already opened my Christmas present from her...she rocks!&nbsp; It was awesome and was definitely something I would have picked out myself.&nbsp; Speaking of gifts from that girl, I look forward to using my b-day present from her in the next few days...it's going to ROCK!&nbsp;&nbsp;I definititely need it!</P>
<P>Last night a group of about 10 of&nbsp; us went to Santa's Wonderland!&nbsp; I love the Christmas season sooo much!&nbsp; It was awesome and so beautiful!&nbsp; We sat around a fire at the end and watched a Christmas movie they had playing and walked around and looked at crafts.&nbsp; It was fun and so perfect to get me even more so in the mood for Christmas!&nbsp; </P>
<P>Hmm..finals are going to suck.&nbsp; I have 2 on Friday (originally I had 4!!) and then 3 on Monday....but after that I am done and I will NEVER have to take 19 hours again!&nbsp; I can't wait!&nbsp; Next semester will be nice, especially because I will only be taking 15 hours and my earliest class is T-Tr @935, but M-W-F is @1020!&nbsp; Heck yes for sleeping in!&nbsp; I am just glad that I don't have any 8ams!&nbsp; That would have sucked!</P>
<P>I am going home this weekend for Shannon and Jeremy's wedding.&nbsp; I can't believe that Tom and I are going to yet another wedding!&nbsp; It's all good though because I love weddings...they make me so happy and plus, they give me ideas for ours!&nbsp; I would go home Friday but I have a final that night and besides Danielle is having her bday party then so it all works out.&nbsp; Saturday will be awesome though.&nbsp; I am going home and some of my cousins will be there and we are going to decorate the tree and get the house all finished for Christmas.&nbsp; Then Saturday night Tom and I are going out on a long awaited date!&nbsp; After all that we've been through these past couple of weeks it's going to be absolutely amazing to see him and for us to be alone!&nbsp; I love that man more and more each day; he's so incredible!</P>
<P>I look forward to the Christmas break.&nbsp; No school, no homework, no waking up early!&nbsp; I get to see my baby a whole freaking lot, I get to see my wonderful family and my awesome friends that I miss like crazy.&nbsp; I think that the break away from Aggieland will be quite nice.&nbsp; I am definitely ready for it!&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I am going to miss some of my Aggie buddies...but that's what AIM is for!&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, good-luck to everyone that is studying for finals!&nbsp; Enjoy these couple of days that we have off!&nbsp; WHOOP for no more lecture this semester!&nbsp; </P>"

"event","I never thought that I was the kind of person that always ""talked"" to God and never listened.  But I think that sometimes I need to stop and just listen because He has some pretty awesome things to share. 
I've learned a lot this week by just listening Him.
All I have to say is that sometimes just listening will help way more than ""venting"" and rambling on and on.


It's been hard not getting to talk to Tom like I want, but I see that it was and is something that must be done.  Taking personal time during the day was the hardest thing I thought I would ever have to do.  But I have learned so much more about myself and by this I can be a stronger more confident woman for him.  We are growing tremendously individually from this experience.  We are being the people that God intended us to be so that when we do see each other we can confidently know that things have been forever changed and that we are being the best people that we can be for one another.  All this is making my love for Tom grow and grow, and his love for me grow and grow.  It does make sense though, stronger individuals make for a stronger couple!  








I love Thomas Joseph Hauck."

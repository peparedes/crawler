My sister and I have always been close - being only one year apart - even as we grew older and moved out of parents' home. But now she is moving half way across the country. I know she needs a fresh start in life and it will be good for her. But I know my family will miss her and I will too."

As you grow older, though, Christmas is less about gifts and more about the people you spend time with and what it means to you. About love, about forgiveness, about caring. A lot of people in this world still want Christmas to be about a Grand stand on religious principles and on war and rally on fighting..  personally i am tired of that.. if you can not love one another even on this very holy night, then you have forgotten the true teaching of Christ."

It's supposed to be an ads about clothing and fashion accesories, but in the background there was this newspaper with this humorous headline. It is true too. The Federal Government is spending like a madman despite of the huge deficit we already have. The President last night just promised a huge aid package (and thus Governmental spending) to the Katrina victims and in a month or so he is going to push for more cuts for Estate/Inheritance Tax. Chances are they will raise the exemption amount from 1.5 million to 3.6 million. It would be nice not have to pay tax if you die with 3 million dollar of net worth, but I can't help to wonder how the Congress is going to keep the revenue neutral. Again, it is one of those mysteries of DC.

It's back to work, back to school for everyone. I just spoke to my brother on the phone, and he is ready to head back to college. I think I will sign up for that LSAT prep course. If I am really serious about this law school thing, it is better to be over-prepared than under-prepared. And knowing myself it is best to have something structured to guide my study for the exam. I also have to think about if I want to quit my job at one point of time and actually spend 3 years full time getting the J.D. or do it part-time. Chances are I will have to do it full-time.

It was the one alternative to Newsweek and Time, and for years it was enjoyable and infomative to read. Not to mention the famous 'Ranking of America's colleges' But since about a year ago, I think right about when the political battle between Republicans and Democrats got really ugly, the U.S. News decided that they could get more market share and sell more magazine by becoming more political and capturing the politically conservative audience that Time and Newsweek failed to capture. It worked for the magazine, I think. But the magazine's quality has been declining ever since. It has been too overtly political and filled with commentataries and editorials from right-wing political pundits. Not that there is anything wrong with it. After all, it is a publication and its first amendment right still applies. But it ruins the whole 'News Magazine' aspect of reading experience for me. Some of the newest issues - I can't tell if I am reading 'U.S. News' or 'Weekly Standard'. (Weekly Standard, however, I truly enjoy - It has a lot of good points. And it does what a political magazine should do. Being political) I have subscribed it for 4 years. But I think I will let my subscription run out after this September. It is a shame."

We can log on to weather.com to check our local forecast down to our ZIP code.  So why are the TV news channel still employing 'meterologists' to report weathers on TV. I mean, I can understand if they are doing the advanced, complicated, and detailed work at background. But why are they reporting it? The fat guy with a doctorate degree would not do a better job in rattling out the Forecast on camera than a pretty, semi-educated weathergirl (remember them back when you were a child?) It must be to project an image of professionalism for the station - but honestly, it is probably not worth the money to hire them to just be on camera.

Of course, you have to put up a show for your family and friends to be happy that they are celebrating your birthday for you. I had a small dinner party, cake and what not. But by 9pm that night when I return home to my apartment, I was truly depressed. I went down to the local coffeehouse for a cup of iced tea. The clerk there saw me and said (I am a regular customer, so she knows me a little bit), ""Oh, cheer up, it is Saturday."" I replied, ""It is my birthday. You are allowed to be a little sad on your own birthday."" That is how I ended my 29th birthday - Sitting outside the coffeeshop, under the breezy night sky, with a glass of ice tea, and writing my journal."

I talked to my friend Ben last night about what we thought we are in life and what we thought we should be. Ben and I graduated from high school together 10 years ago, and he is going back to Medical School this year to get his M.D. He is having some regret about not getting it done a little sooner - like straight out of college. I tried to tell him that all of us did the best - made the decisions we made in life given the circumstances in our 20s. So what if we are going to arrive our goals a little late. It would not matter if he becomes a doctor at age of 35 or age of 25. Twenty years from now, it will matter very little. But he reminds me it is easier to take that philosophical attitude in words. Regrets are very real. I do have a few regrets of my own in my 20s. And it is now drawing to a close. But honestly I prefer not to look back at them anymore. I am here and at this moment, 2 weeks before my 29th birthday. I should do something about my life now before I have even more regret about the last year of my 20s."

I was reading on Wall Street Journal that the rich/poor gap is growing larger and larger each year. That doesn't surprise me at all. Our country has become basically two economies - Those who inherited wealth with their hedge funds that are really, really well-off by the recent rise of real-estate and stocks (and we in financial services help them to run them..

In Demoractic side we have Jon Corzine - who spent millions of his own money a few years ago to get elected to senate.

The gasoline price has creeped up once again. And we are supposed to be de-sensitized to it by now, right? That is probably all the giant oil companies want us to believe. Very few people follow the price of crude contracts as closely as I do - I have to, it is part of my job. And I tell you, it is sickening how much money is involved. And just like the old adage, the price of gasoline goes 'up like mercury down like molasses'. I do have to go down to the Shore on Saturday, so I better fill it up while it is still relatively 'cheap'.

There is another Terri Shiavo-like case down in Texas that is brewing up. And another family that is contesting the court order and medical advises of doctors. Chances are it will be another national TV drama, or freak show, depends on how you see it. People feel so strong about this kind of issue that they tend to be blind to all evidences other than their point of view anyway. And the lawyers, politicians, religious advisors go along with it to spin the issues in their favor so they can gain something out of it. The only loser in the case is the actual patient in the question - that and the medical community, since Medicine has become just another arbitrary field decided by public opinion. Who cares about 12 years of schooling those 'M.D.s' have? The people who are doing the blogging and shouting are just as credible.
I am not watching this again, for sure. It is disgusting.

"event","I have a problem. Today I received a peraonal mail from a prominent politician. Last fall I was actively involved in the political affairs in my local community. The truth is, I always knew I have politics like blood in my vein (Hence the Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vadar test result in the previous post.. LOL) Because of my effort last year, I have been noticed and they want some fresh people to get involved this year. But for me personally, this opportunity can not come in at a worst time. I am in a reflective mood, trying to figure out where my life's direction is and what I really want in life. And when I make a list of what is necessary for my happiness in life and what is not necessary in life. Politics is on the 'Not Necessary' list. But how do I explain this sudden change of heart and attitude in life - that 6 months ago I was extremely interested in politics and planning to run for office and now it is one of the least important thing in my life? I will figure something out by the next social function, I hope.

But I know I am a natural-born politician. Even if I don't do it now, I will be back to the game 5 or 10 years from now."

"event","I went to NYC on saturday and met with my old business law professor from university. He was telling me that I should consider going back to school to get a J.D. He thinks it will be a good idea to have a law degree along with my cpa. Apparently he has a few friends who had gone through that career path. He said he will help me in anyway he can if I decide to do it. But the truth is, I have spent a lot of time in school in my 20s, getting my bachelor's and master's. And now I am almost 30 years old. I am really not sure I want to go back for another 3 years of full-time study in my early 30s just to have an add-on degree. I think it is time to concentrate on developing the career I have, enjoying life a little, and maybe trying to figure out what this all means to me before I jump into another academic program again."

I have a lot, A LOT of work to do this week. In fact, I just finished working and it is 2am. I have to get up in 5 hours again. This is taking a toll on me. I just hope I can take a vacation soon or I have to quit this job and do something else. 

I am actually thinking about going back to school and getting a doctorate. I know it is useless because I will never become a professor or a researcher. But hey, Alan Greenspan got his Ph.D. in his 40s. I am not even 30 yet. Why not? I could also go to law school - which I acutally fancy myself doing since I was in college. But I don't know if I want to do that.

"event","The weather has gotten a lot better. It is finally feeling like spring. I have to drive down to visit my parents in south jersey so I am taking the day off. I am relaxed. But I am not so sure I am looking forward to seeing all these people again.

    A lot of news buzzing on the tv and on the paper.. but frankly, they are all the same after a while. I do care. It is just I come to the realization that I can do very little to affect what is going on in this world. Maybe a few things locally and in my immediate circle, but that is about it. I certainly don't elect the Pope (Congratulations, His Holiness Benedict XVI). I certainly can't affect the senate's political process for judicial nominees. A lot of these are politically motivated, anyway. Do you think these politicians actually care about the moral principles, the working people - all these great words they speak to justify their actions - whether they are left or right, Republicans or Democrats? All they care about is whether they get elected or re-elected in the next election. If they can hold on to the power (or even better, advance politically in their career), then they can have their interest advanced. Otherwise, they are useless. They would say anything to get elected. That is why you have people like Tom DeLay still being House Majority Leader even after all these ethical scandals and corruption - because he is tough and politically smart.

    Meanwhile, working people like me can only hope the gasoline price won't go up again while I take my long drive down the turnpike to see my folks. That is the sad truth. Hey, at least the weather is getting better."

"event","Monday morning back to work.. Everything is still the same.. You would think things would be a little different.. But they are still the same. It is sad that the Rules of Universe doesn't change just because you have a change of heart. Cars still pile up in the early morning commute. Pepsi still overflows the cup if you pour it too fast. So what am I going to do? 

I'd like to think I can make a difference, make a dent to this world. I really do. But I know there are millions, millions of people out there who are as disappointed about life as I do. All the brave talks about each person makes a small contribution, a small stand to his/her own fate may just be that - brave talks. Sometimes I think too much.

If it is peace of mind I seek, then all these struggles must end in some way. But I know deep down inside I am not willing to let go yet."

"event","With the recent passing of Pope John Paul II, the world has paid attention to the Roman Catholic Church again. Tomorrow 105 cardinals will enter the conclave and select a new pope to succeed John Paul II. Many names are floating in the news, but it is safe to say no one has any idea what they are talking about. And since the cardinals are not talking (they have taken an oath of silence), we can only wait. Remember, 'He who enters the conclave a Pope comes out a cardinal.""
  
    But I really want to say something about John Paul II. I mean, I am not a Catholic and certainly by no means the most religious person in the world. But he was the head of Roman Catholic Church for most of my life - since I was 2. He was the only pope I have ever known. After his death there were all sort of calling for immediate sainthood and even the title of John Paul the Great. I don't know how the Catholics will go about doing that. But I could safely say he had had tremendous impact on the world, whether you agree with his theology or world-view or not. (In my case, I really don't agree with him on everything)
One hundred years from now, people are probably going to forget about George W. Bush or Bill Clinton as some presidents in the history book. But they might not be able to forget about John Paul II. In that respect, perhaps he is great.

    However, with my condolence to the Catholic Church, they know as well as I do it is time to move forward. And to start to lighten things up, here is a joke I heard today about Pope:

    During a trip to New York, the pope begs his limo driver to let him behind the wheel. Unable to say no to his holiness, the driver agrees and gets in the back. Within a block, the two are pulled over, but when the officer sees who's driving, he calls his sergeant.

    ""Sarge,"" he stammers. ""I stopped someone really important and I don't know what to do.""
    ""Is it the mayor?"" his sergeant asks.
    ""No, sir, more important.""
    ""The governor?""
    ""Negative, sir. More important.""
    ""Don't tell me you stopped the god-damn president,"" the Sarge yells.
    ""Nope, more important than even the president!"" the officer says.
    ""Who the hell is it then?""
    ""I don't know,"" the officer responds, ""but his driver is the pope!"""

"event","The saying goes, ""He who seeks revenge should dig two graves."" My heard this saying a while ago. I have always thought it interesting and informative, but never truly believed in it. That is, until recently. In all my clumsy efforts to get back at people or things so far in life, most of them have backfired. Even if they succeeded, they usually take a toll on me. (And as I looked at a distribution chart of this livejournal users, I am actually one of the oldest users here - statistically - at the age of 28. Something I find amusing and sad at the same time.) 

    This is not to say we should underestimate the power of revenge. Hate, in fact, can get you going for a long, long time. The need to get even because of an injustice has done to you is instinctual. It has been the basis of a host of great literatures. Think Count of Monte Cristo. Think Hamlet. Think the idea of Final Judgment by Christ in Christian Theology. The great philosopher Immanuel Kant in fact insists Justice on earth should be for retribution. We really want to get things right in our life. When they are not, they become great motivations for us to strive toward something. The negative can be positive - to a point of time.

    But eventually, it will eats you up inside if you don't move on. What they didn't tell you is the fact Hamlet had to die for the success of his revenge. Think about it, it is a conquest that will never end. On your way to complete your revenge, chances are you will encounter more injustices in life. For every person or event in your life that you want to get even, there can be three people or events that will be added on your revenge list before you get done with the first one. Hence it was said in the movie ""Kill Bill"" -- ""Revenge is never a straight line. It is a forest. It is easy to get lost."" And if you are hoping for the Final Judgment to sort everything out on 'dies irae', that is a long time to wait. So what to do meanwhile we are on this Rock and alive? to be or not to be, indeed..

    Anyway, enough meaningless writing. Time to get back to my accounting work. (Did I mention I have one of the most boring professions?)"

"event","Well, this is going to be my first entry in this live journal. It is my journal, so I am going to tell my story and be honest about it. I am a 28 year old man. All my life I have felt I was extremely lucky and privileged. I was born in a well-to-do, if not rich, family. I did very well in school as a child, all the way till high school. I was at top of my class when I graduated from high school and attended an ivy-league university. Then in the middle of my sophomore year in college, a very bad episode of clinical depression hit me. Since then, I have not been quite the same. I have struggled a lot in my 20s. It took me longer than I expected to finish college, although I did finish it with some help from fate and ironic determination. I was never able to have a meaningful romantic relationship for a long time, and I could not hold a full-time job longer than half a year after I graduate. In essence, I was a loser - simple as that. And I still feel like that today, even though I have somehow managed to turn the corner and made a few changes in my life.

     Who was it that said, 'Life is too short to be small'? But the sad truth is, as I am approaching 30 (in about a little more than a year), I am beginning to get the feeling that life can be nothing but small. As we start out early in life, we all had big dreams and all the things we want - to be a rock star, to be a race-car driver, to have the love of our life, to be the freaking President of United States! But how many of these dreams actually realize? As individual, I can not help to feel like my life has to make a difference - that God must put me on this earth for a purpose. But then I thought about the billions of people on this tiny rock we called earth in the tiny galaxy among billions of stars in the Universe.. maybe I am not that important after all... But as long as I am alive, how can I do anything differently? Will I keep trying and get my head banged in every single time? Or is there one day I am going to stop caring because everything I want in this life just isn't there anymore? I look at the stars and wonder..

     Then I remembered... if you look up to the sky for too long, you might lose your footing on the ground."

"event","Ok so school's really been killing me lately...days are just way too long...i'm like a zombie monday thru thursday...and on Friday when i'm off...i'm actually SOOO drained...i can't even enjoy it...then there's mah baby Jannale...it's tough to have the strength to show her that i'm still as much in love with her as the first day...when i have almost 0 energy left...and i drown myself in a computer game because i have to exert the least amount of energy and thought into it...BUT...whatever...i'm done yacking bout that...

So anyways i've been loving the last few episodes of SmaLLviLLe...it's really been getting a lot better...with the exception of the annoying storyline they've got going between Lana and Clark...JEEZ...is it just me or have they been making Lana such a bitch...towards Clark at least...i'm so annoyed i'd actually not mind Chloe and Clark hooking up...but knowing me...once they do..i'd want it to end HAHA...or would i? heh...now onto THE MORE INTERESTING STUFF...soo...who exactly is this Adam Knight??? well...i'm guessing it's a young Bruce Wayne...aka...BATMAN!!!!  HELL YEAH!!! now you say what do i have to back up this theory??? how bout this...

Ok. This guy is not just your average joe. Alot of people have been speculating that Adam Knight is really Bruce Wayne a.k.a Batman. 

The clues I've seen that this could be true from tonight's Smallville episode(02-11-04) and past episodes 

1.)He has the right look, physically. 

2.)He knows martial arts. 

3.)He has impressive computer skills. 

4.)He has shown intelligence and seems very well read. 

5.)His personality seems dead on. His interaction with Lana Lang on tonight's episode seemed very much how a young Bruce Wayne might act. 

6.)He always wears Black and Grey...Batman Colors...just like Clark wears the obvious Superman Colors...

7.)""Adam"" West/Dark ""Knight""

    Whatever the case there is much more to Adam Knight than meets the eye. If he isn't Bruce Wayne then who is he? 

Well...if he isn't Bruce wayne my second theory is that he's Lionel Luther/Clark Kent clone...ewwww....that would be nutz...but not as insane as him being BATMAN OMG that would be sooo tite! It'll be true to the comics the first Batman/ Superman team up on smallville...WEEE...so awesome...hrrmm....what if we find out for sure maybe during the Finale or something...PICTURE THIS...on the Seaon Finale ending...

Adam is on the sidewalk saying his goodbyes to everyone in Smallville. A black sedan pulls up to the curb. A thin,balding Englishman with a pencil thin mustach gets out and opens the back door and says,"" Your going to be late for your flight,Master Bruce."".  hrmm...SWEETNESS!!!


OK...and once again i'll slip back into the shadow lands of the Live Journal Universe from whence i came...i mean...who likes to read my jibberish to begin with..."

WELL...what's your social mask? and WHY?

"event","Do you ever just get that feeling where you don't want to talk to anybody? you dont want to smile, and you don't want to fake being happy. but at the same time, you don't know exactly what is wrong either. there isn't a way to explain it to someone who doesn't already understand. if you could want anything in the world it would be to be alone. people have stopped being comforting.. and being alone never was. at least when you're alone no one constantly asks you what is wrong and you dont know the answer. you feel the way you do just BECAUSE. you hope the feeling will pass soon and that you will be able to be yourself again, but until then all you can do is wait ...

"event","If you could rid the world of one emotion, what would it be? Personally I'd say jealousy 9 out of 10 times. That 1 vote would most likely be regret. However, regret and jealousy seem to be ugly sisters in the way they are comprehended. In a sense, jealousy is the act of regretting not being or having something other than what you are. Regret in the modern sense though, is getting drunk and consequently horny, and then the only thing you feel the next morning besides a hang over, is regret... well usually thats the case for at least one of the parties who slept together. Regret also takes the form of a lost oppurtunity, a chance you had to do something great, or maybe just do something at all, and you failed or wussed out. So now we have the Regret of not having done something, the Regret of having done something you wish you hadn't, and the regret that is so closely related to jealousy. Regret and jealousy plague my life, of this I am sure, sometimes i feel like i'm not even living because i'm spending all my time whining about the past and worrying about the future, I never stop and look around, the most widely known quote from Ferris Bueller is so god awfully true, Life moves fast, if you don't stop to look around once in a while, you could miss it... This is harder than it sounds. To look around at the present you have to let go of the past for a minute and not care what misfortunes the future has in store, you have to smile and relax, you have to like what you're doing and who you are, and in my case, you have to be extremely intoxicated via some illegal narcotic to attain this sublime state. I'm aspiring to learn the entire ""To be or not to be"" Hamlet speech, a lot of people disregard Shakespeare or asociate him with english assignments and therefore consider him a pest, but William Shaky is probably the greatest writer ever. I feel that his work is greatly un-apreciated but i'm gonna stop here and go do something happy...rofl....i guess i'm having one of those thought FUL days... However, I leave you with this, it may be generic but it can also be thought provoking.... If somebody wrote a book about your life, would anyone want to read it?? 

P.S - You think i'm nothing more than what you think I am."

"event","Okay...sOoOoOo...i was reading my Literature book...FOR FUN...OMG...and i decided to read ahead on my assigned readings...and i started analyzing the stories and just looking for the TRUE meaning...because they ARE short stories...not the mass produced novel that usually is just written to entertain us...anyhoo...one of the stories involves a teen who hungers for love and a girlfriend but can't seem to get one because he's ugly...CLASSIC..person's UGLY...so person gets no time of day...anyhoo...this is what i thought...

         Everything is about appearance, physical form... what a bother.... Tons of people hate bugs, they think spiders are icky and misquitoes are the most annoying things ever, yet they will play joyfully with a lady bug or a fire-fly, when the truth is that these ""pretty"" bugs contain the same appendixes as the other ones you hate, they have the wings, and the serrated teeth and the clutchy tiny leg thingies.... Ok but my point is if your ugly, or nasty, or annoying, people won't give you the time of day, and if they do it's because they want you to go away. Being beautiful can make life just that much better. Then comes that saying, or that cliche, ""accept who you are"" or perhaps the one that says something along the lines of ""Love yourself""...HUGS ALL AROUND because we all are loving creatures who are uncappable of envy and who are void of spite, un-aware of such things as malice and avarice, enlightened only in the arts of love and kindness, and in our land where the fairies spread aphrodisiacs amongst our flower gardens and .... o wait, thats that other world i used to live in, what was it called.... o ya they call it childhood, i live in a new world now, everything is as beautiful or as ugly as you think it is, except for man kind. Sure you can cherish the gifts we have given each other in this world but all i'm saying is that the rivers of filth that course through everyone's veins eventually overflow and cause disgusting words to babble out of our mouths or our bodies to perform atrocities. Life is ugly, and if this wretchedness cannot be seen on the surface of things than its just that more ugly. Humanity is ill natured and self-serviant, it's impossible to be human and not be terrible in some region of importance. I know I make things sound worse than they are, but it's fun, and my argument does hold some truth. I bet that you can't name one person that you can say you've known for a little while who is a truly good person, who doesn't have some area of mentality where they are just psycho or at least troubled. Every human you walk past on the sidewalk and in the cafeteria, every person that drinks from the water fountain in front of you or the previous person who checked out the same book as you..... all these people are FUCKED UP. They all have stories, they all have their most embarrassing moments, they all have secrets, evil secrets, they all have odd desires and habits, people will never cease to make the headlines of newspapers interesting. Whether you have the urge to be a child molestor or be put into bondage, or maybe you like being the center of attention or you only shop at abercrombie because of the logo.... whether sexual or social, physical or mental, everyone is fucked up. O ya and some people are suprising, hilarious, amazing, incredibly talented, breathtakingly beautiful, some are altruistic, sometimes all you really need is another person. k i'm done slandering humanity, bye."

      Well quite a bit has happened since i really last wrote...glad to hear that some of you ppl actually read my crap and would like to see what other adventures i go on or messes i make out of this life...sigh*...ROFL...well...i start school again on Sep 2...i'm hoping to do very well this semester...FOR MY SAKE...and i'm finally LOOKING TO TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER...i need to get a job...start saving a little bit cash...I didn't get to see JannaLe all this summer....IT SUCKED...but hopefully next year i can take the trips i've been meaning to take for a long time...things just didn't work out this summer for me in that dept...so now it's time to MAKE THINGS HAPPEN...I don't know where i'm gonna get work...but i'll find a place...so far..i've just been busying myself by doing projects round the house...upgrading my computer into an ULTIMATE GAMING MACHINE...sorta...i've let my hair grow out...and it's almost wavy again...but i don't know if i'm going to keep it much longer...
        Also...it turns out...that me and Jannale had a HUGE argument (this was like 4 weeks ago)....big misunderstanding...and we sorta kinda broke up...BUT THAT DIDN""T LAST LONG...lol...we were back the next day or so...We LOVE eachother too much...and we know that we can't be with any other...only thing that sucks is that she's back in school...and when i get back in school...our schedules are really gonna put a damper on the times we can talk...which is probably gonna be a lot less than EVERYDAY as we usually talk...HOWEVER...my BABY...being the very ORGANIZED and MOST THOUGHTFUL person she is..... and thinking ahead found a sort of solution...She went to a site called Beatgreets.com and typed up over 100 letters to songs that describe a reason she loves me....LOL....LIKE WHOA...so for the next 100 days i will be receiving an email from her at 2:22 am everymorning telling me one of the many reasons she loves me....and explained in detail...LOL...SHE'S AMAZING....INCREDIBLE...I LOVE HER...i swear...i didn't even think of that...now she went and made me LOOK BAD...LOL...
       Well i have a bunch more to say...BUT...i'll save that for later...NOW...DINNER TIME....OH...before i go...NICE TO HEAR FROM MY SEXY VANCOUVER BAD BOY...CHRISX0R...I wish i was there so i could rub oil all over your hot sweaty 183 pounds of muscle body...as for me...you can rub oil over my 150 pound body...GUT INCLUDED...BUDDHA SIZE...HAHA...i need to start doing MAD CRUNCHES...i killed my routine a month ago...i'm a SLACKER...DAMNIT! And as for RANDY...DUDE...HAVE FUN up there in BELLINGHAM...maybe we can kick it for reals if ya ever come down to Jersey again...for more than a week...AIGHT...ok...food awaits me....YUM YUM TIME FOLKS...."

     <b>PERFECT</b>

<i>Hey dad look at me
Think back and talk to me
Did I grow up according to plan?
Do you think i'm wasting my time
Doing things I wanna do?
'Cuz it hurts when you disapprove all along

And now I try hard to make it
I just want to make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
I can't pretend that I'm all right
and you can't change me

'Cuz we lost it all
Nothing lasts for ever
I'm sorry I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late and we can't go back
I'm sorry I can't be perfect

I try not to think
About the pain I feel inside
Did you know you used to be my hero?
All the days you spent with me
Now seem so far away
And it feels like you don't care anymore

And now I try hard to make it
I just want to make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
I can't stand another fight</i>
And nothing's alright

Nothing's gonna change the things that you said
Nothing's gonna make this right again
Please don't turn your back
I can't believe it's hard just to talk to you
'Cuz you don't understand"

Plus they gave us fresh baked loaf of their sourdough bread which was VERY VERY good...i have to admit...i've tried quite a few sourdoughs...but this one was awesome....crisp yet tender crust...and very very soft inside...i've never enjoyed soup and sandwich as much as i did then! I'm already craving Panera again...HEHE...
     Well today...was RAINY ONCE AGAIN...so that pretty much put a damper on my Bar-BQ plans....BOOOOOO!!!!! So i guess i'll have to barb-Q some other day...and it looks like clouds and showers til tuesday according to the 5 day forecast! GOD it really sucks...i hate the weather! It's the middle of FRIGGIN MAY ALREADY and NO FRIGGIN SUNSHINE! Jeez! I'm sick of it already...it's been this way for almost 2 weeks now...GOD! Today was nonetheless relaxing...i think tomorrow i'll start on my reading and studying for my first test...yeah...that would probably be a GOOD and UNLAZY...and UNPROCRASTINATED idea! haha....OOOoooOOOHHHhh...i finally made my fruit salad....the cool whip...chopped walnuts...fruit...marshmallows...mmmMMmm...soOOoo refreshing...i swear....when i get married...I gotta have fruit salad at my reception! LOL...i can picture it already...me scarfing it down like nobody's business....while new bride laughs...and wipes off the smudge of cool whip on the corner of my mouth....with her index finger...and seductively sucks on it...LOL...and then kisses me...LMAO! OH MY GOD! I can so picture Jannale doing that...lol...HEAVEN? YES!
     Hmm...oh...i made my furry bundle of barking joy bath today...he NEEDED IT! lol...the poor critter...i think he misses my dad...it's funny...we was all looking depressed today...everytime we take out suitcases he goes crazy! He thinks he's always gonna go...and usually my parents take him...but if they can't we put him in a VET KENNEL...HE HATES IT THERE! lol...but i spent sometime playing with him...giving him treats...and making him smell like Candy Apple...haha...it's the scent of his bath shampoo...He's such a good dog i swear...he FULLY COOPERATES...and i even had to blow dry him which took bout 45 minutes...and i made him stand the whole time...and he did it...no problems...such a good dog! Man i'm sooo craving Kalbi shortribs and Rice....OH MAN OH MAN! if it isn't too rainy tomorrow...i'm gonna barb-Q it anyways....lol...I MEAN IT...I WILL!

She means so much to me...and with every passing day...i'm reminded once again just how special a person she truly is...and she has so many admirers too...so many guys want to hook up with her..and yet she still manages to find me worth being with...and worth the time and patience...even with all that temptation...this is a piece of an email sent to her by one of the guys that likes her...


<b><i>""Hey girl wassup...Are you ready for our final tomorrow...Hope you finished translating all your sentences....Wanted to tell you how lucky of a man your boyfriend is...Only girl I know that has so many guys that wants to hook up with you, but stays true to your man....and he's all the way thousands and thousands of miles away..I can only imagine how committed you would be if he were here...I guess that's why so many guys want to hook up with you...A woman like you is so hard to find now a days...Especially a committed one like yourself....I'm really glad that I've gotten to know you...You are a really great and special person....""A Diamond In the Rough.""""</i></b>

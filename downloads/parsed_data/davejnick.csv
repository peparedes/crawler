I'd ask if you've missed me, but the chances are that 99% of my ""followers"" (can you tell I've been on Twitter a lot in the meantime?) have probably either forgotten who I am, or given up waiting and deleted me. Such is life. 

So, why, you may ask?

Frankly, because I need somewhere to rant and vent and talk about randomness. Somewhere, specifically, that'll let me use more that 140 bloody characters in an update. 

So, what's happened in the last few years? 

Well.

There's a wife, a mortgage, and ""The Boy"". All of which appeared in that order, which was nice. 

The wife is Hayley, aka Pepper, from previous updates, if you can remember back that far. If not, feel free to check back and refresh your memories. I can wait. 

All sorted now? Good. Then I'll continue. 

The mortgage is on a house in sunny Doncaster, a place I'd never given any serious thought of living in until H pointed out the logistics of childcare with her folks being just down the road, and mine being easily within reach via the motorway. 

Ah, yes. I also own a car, although I've driven it only once, very badly, so I still haven't seriously used my licence since the day I passed my test when I was 18. 

As time goes on I might update this more. If only, as I said, because it's sometimes very difficult getting your true hatred of Simon Cowell/David Cameron/Jeremy Kyle across in such brevity as to be able to do so on ""the other one"". As I do so, I'll keep filling in the blanks of the last couple of years on the off-chance that (a) there's anyone reading, and (b) that you actually give a shit. 

Good to be back."

On Friday night before to the Tyla gig (which was fucking awesome, btw) myself and Hayley were standing at the bar in The Howard, and I decided that it was time to go for it. 

""Are we going to stop fucking about then, or what?""

Oh yes. That was the romantic line that resulted in me changing my Facebook status from ""single"" to ""in a relationship"", and has had almost everyone who knows both of us saying some variation of ""it's about bloody time"".

I'm not entirely sure what else to say, other than that I feel like the world's biggest fool for taking so long - especially after last night when we actually talked about how long we've both felt like this.

I'm a twat sometimes.

So, yes, it's on.

I've yawned a lot. I've made a few CDs for folk, and posted them. I've become addicted to shopping at the Early Learning Centre. I've bought a copy of one of my favourite books of all-time as a Christmas present for someone, who I hope will love it. I'd had random songs stuck in my head 24 hours a day. I've wrapped some Christmas presents. I've written some cards. I've realised that my lack of planning and preparation has been my undoing yet again. I've done quite a lot of work. 

I've been overwhelmed by Baby Rachel's gorgeousness - takes after her mum, definitely.

"event","As usual, I'm very badly organised when it comes to Christmas. As usual, I made a good early start with the present buying, and then got lulled into a false sense of security because I'd bought quite a few things for quite a few people, and then just stopped, apparently expecting the elves to do the rest of it. 
The plan was to do some more of it today, but you know what? I really can't see that happening.

I do have to venture into town at some point though, and not just because I have to go to the station, and not just because I have bit to post.
I also have to buy baby-related goodies. 

Rich and Hannah are now the proud parents of Rachel Louise, a 7lb 5oz shining light of happiness among all that is awful in the world. So happy for them. I'm hoping to get down to see them next weekend. Apparently she's already a bit of a show-off (takes after her dad then) so she'll love the attention. 

That really has made me happy.

In fact, yesterday must have been the day for babies, as Jeni and Davie are also now facing up to the reality of dirty nappies and sleepless nights. 
Quite bizarre actually, because Jen has always been (and will always be) ""Jim's little sister"" in my eyes.
Bloody hell, that makes me feel old.
But, at the same time, really happy (again). 

Two couples, both of whom have been through a HELL of a lot to get this far. They deserve all the smiles they're enjoying now."

Or maybe just have a go at the scriptwriting one that kicks off in a few months. Finally get round to doing something with these random ideas that have been floating around for so long.

"event","I've been really tired these last few days. I'm blaming the clocks changing. Pepper is blaming it on the fact that I'm (apparently) getting old.

Steff had a kitchen disaster yesterday when she, for reasons best known to herself, attempted to grill a pan of milk. Naturally, she wasted no time in texting me to tell me of this culinary masterpiece, along with an explanation which ran something along the lines of her microwave also having a grill setting which confused her. It did however inspire to wonder what would happen if hot chocolate made with milk (the ONLY way to have it) was combined with marshmallows, and then put under the grill. 
So I decided to have some hot chocolate with milk tonight, even making a point to stop at the shop on the way home to buy extra.
Pity I didn't think to buy marshmallows as well...

Did I mention that I've been sorting through some of the boxes that were at the back of the garage? Most of them contained video tapes of varying descriptions, all of which have now gone in a skip due to the fact that I've got nothing to play the buggers on. A few of them had been stuffed full of books, some of which will shortly be making their way inside to the nice warm house instead of the cold damp garage, the rest will be rehoused via either the charity shop (most likely) or, if I can be arsed to do it, ebay (most unlikely).
I've also discovered some old school reports and photos. The pics, I will eventually scan and put up on Facebook. The reports, I'll just keep reading. I was amazed at how many memories, both good and bad, the reports brought back. And I was also amazed at how many names I could remember form the photos. I wonder what they're all doing now.

The postman's been busy lately, what with me buying randomness on the net, and sending a few bits and bobs to various corners of the country. Just doing my bit to boost profits. It all goes towards my bonus, remember.

PDR tomorrow. Joy of joys.

And there I go again, yawning.
Can't even blame the heat for making me tired, because it's bloody freezing!!"

Let's face it, <i>Lost In Austen</i> is just <i>Life On Mars</i> with corsets, isn't it? 
I just wonder how long it will be before Mr Darcy starts talking about ""shandy drinking poofs"" and tells the Bennetts that they're ""surrounded by armed bastards"".

<b>The Burning Hearts Brighton Bash</b>
A fantastic weekend, which is being reported here about two weeks late, due mainly to the fact that I've been too lazy to do it sooner.
We'd only been off the train for about ten minutes when we had the first contender for the dumbest quote of the weekend. A girl in the off license was buying some bottles of Corona, and when asked by the shop assistant if she'd rather have cold ones from the fridge, replied ""Are they the same price?""
The hotel was right on the seafront, more or less, and within easy crawling distance of the pier. On the first night, we went for a bit of a stroll down to the arcades, and spent a bit of time on the 2p machines, as well as going to find The Hobgoblin, which was to be the venue for the following day's adventures and escapades. 
Stumbled across the place, more by luck than judgement, and met up with Craggy and Mark for a few pints. Learned later that Nicola was there as well, but as we hadn't actually been introduced at the that point, neither of us knew that the other was in attendance.
It was later during that fateful Friday night that I apparently came out with another contender for quote of the weekend, when I was heard to mutter while half-asleep ""I'm a bloke, it's my job to be confused"".
On to the Saturday, when we arrived outside the venue for about midday, having been led to believe that that was what time it was going to be opening. Half an hour later, having figured out that we'd been slightly misled, we bumped into Steve and Mandy while wandering down the road killing a bit of time. On returning to the venue to find that the doors had just opened, it was time to go inside...
We'd been in for a matter of minutes when Craggy gave us the bad news that there was no soundman, no DJ, and no mic stands. The chap who was going to be doing/arranging all of the above was now apparently unavailable, due to the small matter of him having quit his job and subsequently having been banned from the premises. Fortunately, help was at hand, as Craggy called in a few favours, much to the disappointment of Pepper, who had volunteered to be a human mic stand, and was rather looking forward to it.
More familiar faces arrived. Jason and Trudi (who almost immediately invited us to stay at their place for the London trip in a couple of weeks), Bruce, Emma and Sarah, Medicine Stu and Wordy, Dave and Nige, and Alastair, who'd driven across from Wales on his own when the rest of his band had been unable to make it.
A few short acoustic sets, including a rendition of ""Jeff Buckley's Dead"" by The Medicine Bow, and a soundcheck from The Gasoline Queens that was quite simply blistering, and it was on with the serious business of selling raffle tickets (and burgers, which were being cooked/cremated by Mark on the BBQ outside). 
All of the bands were excellent, as you will be able to see if and when the DVD ever sees the light of day. You'll enjoy it - if only for the footage of my dancing...
Not even the astonishing inability of the bloke in the takeaway to cook a burger properly was enough to ruin the day.
And then it was Sunday. Torrential rain, and a slight miscalculation as to the opening times of the shops in Brighton on Sundays left us retreating into Wetherspoons at quarter past 10 in the morning. Well, pear cider is fruit based, so it's not <i>that</i> bad...
I think we ended up rather annoying the poor chap who found himself sat at the table with us on the train north, mainly by the fact that the books we were reading were hilarious, and therefore barely a few minutes passed without the books being swapped across the table, shortly followed by laughter and giggling.
The perfect end to the weekend would have been a few drinks in The Howard upon our return to Sheffield. Alas, with it being a Sunday, they'd closed the doors early due to boredom...

<b>Driftrun at The Boardwalk</b>
If you ever have the misfortune to see a band called District Line, I can only hope that you'll be carrying a gun at the time. Simply put, they're one of the worst bands I've ever laid my eyes and ears on - and I saw Coal Chamber.
A couple of the other bands (none of which I can actually remember the names of, that is if I ever knew the names in the first place) weren't too bad, most notably the last support, who finished their set with the fantastically titled ""Tonight Matthew I'm Gonna Be Whoever The Fuck I Wanna Be"". 
Driftrun were, well, Driftrun! Opening with ""Devil's Dancefloor"", we got ""Jukebox Suzie"", ""Bound To Fail"" and ""Mellor Road"" soon after, with ""Knifedge"" and ""Something Missing"" also getting an airing, the latter being broadcast live to South Wales via the miracle of modern technology that is the mobile phone. The omission from the set of ""Lots To Learn"" continues to perplex and mystify, leaving those of us who've seen them several times before scratching our heads in bewilderment. The only explanation I can think of is that the band have decided that it's too long, and have dropped it in favour of shorter songs which allow them to fit more tunes into the set. No ""Waiting For Angelina"" either, although it does seem to be on the new CD, which is apparently ready to roll, and which me and Pepper are apparently getting freebies of. Have to get a copy for Laura as well, and have to continue to try to plant the seed of the the thought that a few Welsh gigs would be a good idea!

<b>Ramalamadingdong</b>
But before that, it was time for the Pink Sharabang to roll back into town, lemon cakes and all. 
The tie-dye t-shirts are awesome (although I need a bigger size, due partly to the continued exposure to the cakes), and the new songs (""Orange Wednesdays"" in particular) are still in the rough and ready stages, but sound like they're going to be just as annoyingly catchy as all of the others when they get round to recording them.
The Souvenirs were on as well, never heard them before, but ended up being quite impressed by the time they finished their set, after initially thinking ""There's already a Kaiser Chiefs, why does the world need another one?"" As they went on though, there was enough variety that it didn't end up just sounding like a Kaisers tribute act. 
Good CD too.

<b>Speaking of CDs...</b>
I've finally written the letter and posted them!!

<b>And that, as they say, is that</b>
I really should update this thing more regularly, if only so that every entry doesn't end up being as long as this one.

Packing my bag for the weekend, writing a couple of letters, and probably watching a couple more from the DVD pile.

<b>What I've <i>actually</i> been doing tonight</b>
Becoming a fan of Victoria Pendleton on Facebook, and listening to the new Driftrun songs on Myspace. So it would appear that the one we thought was called <i>Satisfied</i> is actually called <i>Something Missing</i>. Oh, and apparently me and Pepper will be on the guest list for the gig on September 1st...

<b>Dream #1</b>
I was in a CD shop, I think it was meant to be Hudsons but it was far too big. I looked around for ages for things to buy and eventually settled on, amongst other things, a four DVD Lenny Henry boxset. The guy behind the counter went off to fetch the discs, and seemed to be gone for hours, during which time I kept looking around the shop, at one point picking up a copy of the latest NOW! CD to count how many songs were on it that I liked, and thus judge whether it was worth buying. 
Eventually the shop dude returned, with my eagerly awaited Lenny Henry boxset, and as I was about to pay for it, Tom and Teresa came in and stood behind me at the till, but it was as if I was invisible to them because they didn't even acknowledge that I was there. 
Then it got really weird, as I looked down and saw a boot lying on the floor, which was suddenly surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of ants, which then picked it up and started to carry it out of the shop.

<b>Ch-ch-ch-changes</b>
Only been on the team for a couple of weeks and I've proved to be the kiss of death for the boss already, as Craig has been replaced by Catherine...

<b>Let this be a lesson to you all</b>
Too much, and your hand will hurt...

<b>Dream #2</b>
I was in a flat that was meant to be mine I think, it looked familiar but can't think where from. There was a computer keyboard on the floor and I looked down at it and there was a huge great pile of sawdust on it. I looked up to see that it was falling from the ceiling because the ceiling was starting to cave in, then there was a huge crash and the girl from the flat upstairs came falling through the ceiling sat on one of her chairs. We talked for a while and I called her Lucy, thinking that that was her name, but obviously it wasn't, because she got upset and stormed off to sit in the back garden. Later (but I'm not sure how much later) I was looking through my phone and I had a number for someone called Louise, and decided that it was her and so I had to go out into the garden to apologise to her for getting her name wrong.

<b>And so to the weekend</b>
Brighton, for the <i>Burning Hearts Brighton Bash</i>, which promises to be one of, if not THE best weekends since...well...the last time we all got together!

"event","<b>Miles Hunt / Jellobox - Mansfield Town Mill</b>
A chance to see a legend, to see Dave doing a pretty big gig for him, and to go for a bit of a night out with some of my new team mates.
Things didn't get off to the greatest of starts when we struggled to find the venue. Actually, we nearly struggled to find Mansfield because of roadworks. Went for a bite to eat while Dave went and did the soundcheck. Jeez, Mansfield is full of weird people. It was a bit like being at a zoo actually (remember that, it'll be important later), so we didn't loiter any longer than necessary before heading back to the venue.
By which time Craig, Mark, and assorted other folks were arriving (saw Scott, which thoroughly confused me, had me thinking ""what's he doing here???""), and the conversation was entertaining, to say the least. It'd take an entry of it's own, to be honest. 
Maybe I'll tell you when you're all a bit older.
Dave's set was pretty good. Did a lot of new stuff, and to be honest, probably suffered for not having the full band set-up, but still counts as a success - not least because at the end of the night there were people buying CDs and asking him for his autograph!
Miles came on, and didn't even finish the first song before the first ""miserable moment"" of what was to become a very moody gig, which was a shame because other than that it was a pretty damn good show. A few rants here and there (responding to a shouted-out request with the words ""I've been doing this for 22 years, I think I'm a bit better at writing a setlist than you"", and telling someone to ""shut the fuck up"" because they were talking during one of the slower songs). A bit more laid back than expected too, played a lot from the new album which apparently nobody had bought yet, judging by the lack of singing along to the new songs. Not surprisingly, it the Wonder Stuff stuff which got the biggest cheers and caused the loudest sing-alongs.
Finished with ""Unbearable"", of course - if he hadn't played it, he'd have been lynched - but wasn't the greatest gig I've ever been to.
And that line about it being like being at the zoo? We entertained ourselves on the way home by singing ""we're going to the zoo, zoo, zoo...""

<b>It's going great, thanks for asking</b>
The new job, that is. Starting to get my head around it. 
Slowly, but surely...

<b>Is there Life On Mars?</b>
Bizarre dream.
I was in a pub with Pepper, but I didn't know anything about it. I kept asking the barman where I was, what year it was, what was happening. Felt very Sam Tyler-ish. 
He asked if I was taking the piss out of him, and then told me that if I asked any more stupid questions he'd ""have"" me. 
At that point, I got up from my seat and walked across the pub to a huge glass door, which led out to an alleyway. I could see something on the ground outside, so I lay down on the floor, and looked out through the glass to see a little doll of myself, a couple of inches tall, wearing white trainers and a dark blue anorak. Then, for some reason, I opened the door and started running down the alleyway, apparently chasing after someone, but no idea who or why.

<b>Driftrun - Sheffield Plug</b>
Yes, there were other bands on, but none of them are really worth mentioning. Except for the supposed headliners, Twisted Wheel, who no doubt enjoyed the experience of playing to an almost-empty venue because most of the crowd left after Driftrun had finished.
The night got off to a great start when we walked in, and Jack was at the door to ask me why I'd paid when I could have just sent him a text and got a freebie. No point having a friend who's the stage manager at the venue if you're going to pay for your ticket, is there?
As for the band, they were fantastic. No photo's, because we both forgot to take our cameras, but anyway...
Opened with a new one (which I think is called ""Satisfied?"", although I'm more than willing to entertain the thought that I might be completely wrong), and later on, played another new one called ""Angelina"". Didn't play ""Lots To Learn"", but with only half an hour, you'd have to be mad to do a six and a half minute song, however good it is! 
I also got a mention from the stage at the start of ""Jukebox Suzie"". As Gilly attempted to get everyone to clap along to the intro, he said ""it doesn't matter if nobody else does it, because Dave's doing it and he's wearing a hawaiian shirt, and he looks cool"".
Fame at last, eh?

<b>Teatime in The Howard</b>
If it's not Nazi's, it's stumbling drunks. If it's not stumbling drunks, it's the bar staff using the pillars that hold up the ceiling to put on bizarre pole-dancing exhibitions. 
As a wise man once nearly said...probably the best pub in the world."

It's been so long now that I can barely remember enough about this one to write about it.
The evening started off with us being in The Howard, me in my Girls Aloud t-shirt (obviously), and Beth and Natalie admiring said shirt and getting quite excited when we said we were off to see The Bangles.
After a frantic bit to replace the spare tickets (that's the last time I ever buy tickets for someone without getting the money first) we were in, and a very entertaining night was had by all. 
Yes, they were better than expected. Yes, they have all had ""work"" done. 
But who cares, really?

<b>Def Leppard, Whitesnake, Thunder - Nottingham Arena</b>
An impossible venue to find, and even more impossible venue to park the car.
Good job the gig was so good.
Thunder were, well, Thunder. Exactly as expected, no surprises in the set, and Danny's dancing still sucks.
Whitesnake were the awesomest of the awesome, to the point where I went to town next day and bought far too many CDs and DVDs, which I'm still wading my way through. 
Suffice to say that if God wore leather trousers, he'd be David Coverdale.
And the Whitesnake website has a recipe section...
Leppard did the same show that they've probably been doing for the last few months as they've made their way around Europe. While it's good, and polished, and professional, it feels a bit too rehearsed at times.

<b>Heath Ledger is The Joker</b>
Great performance, no question. 
But if he wasn't dead, there's no way they'd be talking about him being a sure-bet for the Oscar.

<b>""I wish they all could be California Girls"", in the style of Gordon Ramsay</b>
Lies...lack of communication...more lies...hammer...nail...heart...DONE!

<b>Meet the new job, same as the old job</b>
After 4 years, it was time for a change. So, while I'm still working in the same office, in the same department, I'm doing something VERY different. Today was the first day of training, and it's been a complete headfuck. Should all (hopefully!) start to make some sense sometime soon. I'll keep you all updated. 
And no, I haven't had that message yet.

<b>I've never met a real-life Nazi before (Aka, ""Nat...phone!"")</b>

Yes, they probably did. But I've been so disorganised and it's been such a hectic week or so that I haven't got the letter written yet! 
They will be making their way across the pond soon - I promise..."

"event","<b>Gig #1 - Thea Gilmore, Sheffield Boardwalk</b>
Thought the place was almost empty when we walked in. Little did we realise that the venue were catering mainly for the, errr, more senior sections of the crowd by having tables and chairs set out in front of the stage. Wasn't sure if it was trying to be a library or a restaurant. The suggestion of the lad at the merch table was for us to start a mosh pit to liven things up. In the end, we didn't have to because the woman who came and stood beside us was being such a pain in the arse with her fucking spazzy dancing that she caused far more distraction than anything we could have done. 
Thea, as always, was damn good (and Nigel's harmonica solo during ""Call Me Your Darling"" wasn't bad either), and the support (a chap called Pete Du Pon - remember that name - was mighty fine too, complete with an acoustic cover of ""Basket Case""), and then she came out afterwards to sign autographs, pose for pics, and break the sad news of Jo Wadeson's retirement to us.

<b>Gig #2 - Def Leppard & Whitesnake, Sheffield Arena</b>
Another day, another rock show, albeit on a much grander scale than the previous one. 
Whitesnake were pretty good, although they dragged on a bit too long for my liking - and most of the entertainment was accidental, as it was caused by David Coverdale having taken full advantage of the backstage refreshments.
Leppard were their usual selves. Slick, polished, FUN! From the union jacks on the video screens before the band came on, to the David Essex cover (I kid you not), to the constant reminders that it was ""Sheffield, our home town!""
Going to see them again in Nottingham in a couple of weeks. Can't wait.

<b>Gig #3 - Pink Sharabang, Sheffield Green Room</b>
Of all the nights to play a show, a night when it's pissing down and there's football on the box isn't the best one to choose. As a result, there weren't that many there for this one, although in a funny kinda way it actually added to the atmosphere rather than taking anything away from it, making it more like an intimate little ""soiree"" than a gig.
Free lemon cake, which is always good, and free (personalised!) tshirts as a thank you for starting the Facebook fans group. Also learned that Amy is very clumsy indeed when it comes to walking down stairs in platform shoes, that she likes Doctor Who even more than I thought, that ""Black Dog"" isn't a Led Zeppelin cover, and that honey is the best cure for a sore throat known to man, woman, or vocalist.
And any gig which features the words ""I've put you on the guest list for tomorrow night"" can't be bad...

<b>Gig #4 - Amy Sharabang, Sheffield Academy</b>
The launch of the new Craine single. When I'd told Tom about it, his response was ""Steve Craine? That fucking cunt?""
The night previously, at the Green Room, Amy had been excited about the show, if a tad nervous as it was her first solo gig (well, Mark was there on guitar, but you know what I mean). She probably should have been even more nervous than she was, as we arrived at the venue to find it full of pre-pubescent punks who were relieved that it was a Friday night as that meant they didn't have to be up for school in the morning.
And Craine had asked her to do an acoustic set?
Actually, make that, Craine had TOLD her to do an acoustic set, with the offer of ""I'll bring the band with me"" being met with a firm refusal and a ""It's our gig, and you'll fucking well do as you're told, cos that way you won't show us up as the talentless hacks we really are"".
The soundman conveniently went missing (what, me, cynical?) just as Amy and Mark were about to go onstage, leading to the farcical sight of them actually being on and trying to start the first song, only to have to leave again because there was nobody at the mixing desk. As you can imagine, the mohawked teenyboppers loved it. 
When they finally did get on, and get heard, it was a pretty damn good example of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat against the odds. I doubt that many of the Craine crowd will be lining up to see Sharabang next time, but at the same time I'm sure that I'd want to have anything in common with them, such as liking the same band... We finally managed to fight our way through the mass of babies to get to the front of the stage about halfway through, and the smile on the stage was a combination of joy and relief. My (admittedly tuneless) singing along to ""Lemon Cake"" brought a big grin from the stage, and a lot of funny looks from the kid stood next to me...
A quick chat with her straight after her set, and we had to make a run for it; a few pints in the The Globe was a far better idea than staying in the Academy and ultimately being locked up for assaulting an obnoxious schoolkid.

Schpong. 
Now repeated to the point where every word which includes an ""s"" has to be pronounced as if it's a ""sch"".
Don't aschk.

That update on Facebook about being tempted to throw someone out of a window wasn't entirely said it jest.

Strange dream. Well, not strange in a ""being chased through a forest by a giant rabbit wearing a clown outfit"" way, but strange in a ""why did she appear in a random dream all of a sudden?"" way.
Actually, it might not be that random. There have been a lot of people I've lost touch with over the years, but Amanda's one of the few that I actually wouldn't mind tracking down (especially after that chat with Polly a couple of weeks ago, which filled in a few gaps).

All going swimmingly until they got the power cut-off because they were close to inciting a riot. Saw Chris Catalyst wandering about as well, had a quick natter and finally bought him that pint I've owed him for about two years.
Then we fell asleep on the way home, missed Chesterfield completely, woke up just as we got to Sheffield, and had to get a taxi home at 1:30am.

Wandering around town for a bit yesterday, partly aimlessly, partly on a mission to buy shoes and trousers (and the Imelda May CD, which is proving harder to get hold of than a person who never has their phone turned on), and partly just getting slowly more and more depressed as I went, to the point where I just wanted to come home and close the curtains, shut the door, and bury my head under the pillow. Not sure what it was that led to that thought - well, ok, I have a rough idea, but don't particularly feel like sharing - but opted against it anyway, and decided to start reading a biography of Sid Vicious instead, which I think will probably be finished tomorrow, if not tonight.

Dave. Unless you're my parents, who are the only people in the world who still call me David.

2. Age:
Physically, 31. Mentally, I'm not sure. It varies from day to day.

3. Location:
Chesterfield. Sunny Derbyshire. It is today anyway, despite the weather forecast this morning saying that it was going to rain. It's not bad. Close enough to Sheffield and Nottingham that you can do the big city thing if it takes your fancy, but also close enough to the countryside that if you want to just go and stare at sheep, you can easily do that as well.

4. Occupation:
I sit at a computer all day, occasionally getting up to go to the printer, and spend my days reading emails and colouring in boxes on spreadsheets. And yes, it is as exciting as it sounds. 

5. Partner:
Don't have one. Partly because I'm a bit fussy, partly because I don't have the confidence to do the whole ""chatting up"" thing, although I'm not sure if that's because of fear of rejection or fear of having the police called if she thinks I'm a crazed stalker.

6. Kids:
No.

7. Brothers/Sisters:
One brother. We get on a lot better now than we ever have before, which is probably mainly due to the fact that we don't see each other that often.

8. Pets:
Nope. Not any more.

9. List the 3-5 biggest things going on in your life:
Well, at the moment I'm having a major clearout of books which I'll either never read again, or which I've never actually got round to reading in the first place and very much doubt that I ever will.
Quite sad when that's the height of the excitement, isn't it?

10. Where and for what did you go to school?
Went to school in Scotland, which always makes for an entertaining conversation when people ask what exams I passed, etc. Went to Uni in Liverpool, which was just a complete waste of three years of my life. Rather than picking a course I wanted to do, and then finding somewhere to do it, I went for convenience (having family there) and ended up doing something that I wasn't actually that fussed about. They did eventually give me a degree (albeit a shit one, mainly out of sympathy I think, because my results were bloody awful) but they weren't the most productive three years, and I don't think I actually got a great deal out of it - other than some insight into what not to do with the rest of my life.

11. Parents:
Dad works for Royal Mail, having spent most of his working life in retail, which led to us moving around a lot when me and my bro were kids. Mum works for Natwest, having previously done everything from school dinner lady to child minding to working in a nursing home to working in a fish and chip shop. I worry sometimes that I'm a disappointment to them - they'd certainly be well within their rights if I was - although I'm probably saved from that status by the fact that my brother is such a fuck-up that I look good in comparison.

12. Who are some of your closest friends? 
I have lots of ""mates"", but not that many ""friends"". They know who they are - although I probably don't tell them often enough. But then who does??"

Second dream saw me at a Liverpool match in the 70s, supposedly at Anfield but it looked absolutely nothing like it, against Exeter. Exeter went 1-0 up (obviously), Kevin Keegan was in goal, and there were two touchlines, about five yards apart, which were causing total and utter chaos and confusion because nobody knew which one was right.

Right, lots to talk about so let's get on with it.

Girls Aloud were fantastic. Although I've copped an amazing amount of shit for going, and even more for buying a t-shirt while I was there. Can't understand it meself. Even if they'd been shite musically (which they weren't) and miming (which they weren't), it was the best SHOW I've ever seen. 
Even better than the original Kiss reunion tour at Manchester Arena in 1996, which has (until now) been the benchmark for such showbizzy fandango malarky.

Scotland was also fantastic. So much so that I came away thinking very seriously about moving back up there at some point. How bizarre to feel slightly homesick after returning from a long weekend away, after not living there for 11 years.

Dagnammit.

Anyone fancy a night out at the Shepherds Bush Empire in September? a band called The Wildhearts are playing, and I've heard they're quite good...

Speaking of quite good bands, new Driftrun track (""Jukebox Suzie"") is now up on their Myspace (Laura is the only one who'll give a shit about this, I think, but I'll post it here just in case anyone else is curious)

Don't you just hate it when a wine that you thought would be good (if only because of the price tag) tastes like fucking vinegar?

Found myself in the unlikely (and unfamiliar) position of actually wanting the Mancs to win the European Cup last week. Mainly because of Peter Kenyon being the odious little toad that he is - come the revolution, he'll be the second one up against the wall (after Mick Hucknall) - but also because I just thought it'd be hilarious if Old Roman took his mighty team back to his homeland (and you just KNOW that he was out to impress all his local cronies with a good performance) and they got their asses spanked. 
Feel a bit sorry for Grant though. He's suffered, I think, for not being the comedic genius the Claudio Ranieri was. He too was like a dead man walking, from the time Abramovich started flashing the cash, but he never got the same bad press that Grant did (despite achieving much poorer results), mainly because his interviews were so entertaining.
But then, it was always a bit like this. 
Off the top of my head, without even thinking about it, there's Malcolm Allison, Dave Bassett and Ron Atkinson, all of whom achieved only moderate success, yet continued to get job after job, and who were looked upon as ""characters"", which ensured a constant flow of positive press, while guys like The Howards (Wilkinson and Kendall) both WON THE LEAGUE but were always looked upon as slightly dour personalities, despite the fact that Kendall's mid-80s Everton team played some of the best football that this country has ever seen (and you know how much it grates for me to have to say that), and they both suffered for it in the eyes of the media.

I should have stayed in retirement though - it's now two says since the match, and my legs are still absolute agony. I've got aches in places where I didn't even know I had muscles. To quote the legend that is Detective Roger Murtaugh, ""I'm too old for this shit"".

And if I do happen to know, and say ""yes, it does go to Chesterfield"", the correct response would be ""thank you"", not ""ok"". Yes, I'm talking about you, the ignorant woman with the green tshirt who left her suitcase in the middle of the aisle so that nobody else could move.

T-shirt arrived on Friday. Had to go and pick it up from the delivery office as there was a fee to pay. Eleven fucking quid, eight of which were for the ""handling fee"", the other three for VAT as it was imported from outside the EU. Damn them, the scoundrels!

Hello again, by the way.

Weird dream last night. I was sat on a grass bank with dad, listening to Colin make a speech about building houses (?) and Jamie Carragher came and sat next to me and signed my jeans. Then a kid came and stood next to us and started having a piss, so I stood up and told him to ""fuck off, you dirty little bastard!""
Like I said. 
Weird.

Happy Smiley has returned. No tan, and wearing gloves.

It seems that it doesn't matter how long things go well, all it takes is one slip up for it to all end up back at square one. That's the perception anyway.

Two bizarre dreams.
In one, I was at Baz's house - at least it was meant to be Baz's house, but I didn't actually recognise it - and he had a goldfish which had legs and wore hiking boots.
In the other, I was asleep in the back of car as dad was driving mum to an acting lesson (?). Phill Jupitus was interviewing Ginger on Radio 5, and had to apologise when he said ""fuck"". There were two glasses on the back of the car that fell and smashed. And we ended up stopping outside a bookshop that just sold biographies of wrestlers.

That MUST be what's happened, cos everybody else seems to have had theirs delivered.

Fantastic show. Made me feel like being a kid again actually. 
And then afterwards, the band all came out to sign stuff and do photos - no pics, cos none of us had a camera (fantastic planning, don't you agree?) but had bought a copy of the live DVD, which now boasts some scribble by them all. 
So, to sum up, Floyd corrected me on the year of the Crank tour with Warrior Soul, Pete had never expected them to tour again, Stumpy thought I was someone else and started talking about the last time we'd met, and Ricky was talking to Jake Burns the other day and made him feel old.
Quality DVD too. Also a new compilation CD on sale, but as I've already got most of the tracks, didn't bother with that one.
Just a shame that it was on the same night as the Jellobox gig across town, and at the same time too, so we couldn't do another CJ/Tyla sprint up the road to do two in one night. Maybe next time...

And so to today. No work, obviously. A day of books and DVDs, methinks, with some additional Sky+ viewing thrown in for good measure. 

I'm confused. Nothing new there, you might think. But thought I'd mention it anyway.

We've got the bonus. A nice little extra bit of spending money for next month then, although I won't actually see any of it because I'll just use it to pay of the HMV card. Storecards are fucking evil. Especially ones for GOOD shops like that!
As for the pay rise, God knows what's happening with that. The offer's been made to the union, who have now decided to act like a bunch of arseholes, not agree to it, not agree to schedule any meetings to even talk about, in fact they won't even acknowledge the fact that the offer exists. If I was actually in it, I'd be giving serious thought to WHY on earth I was. They're supposed to represent us, yet we're a complete afterthought - basically, if you're not a postie, they couldn't give a fuck. 
Hopefully it'll end up like it was the last time they decided to play silly buggers, when the gaffers just decided to give it to us anyway because they were sick and tired of being pissed about.
Right.
Rant over.

Been a bizarre week so far. Because Dad's been away for his birthday, I've been doing the shopping for present/card thinking about giving it to him tonight - so, of course, what happened was I forgot that the actual day was yesterday! The fact that I slept through my alarm so it was a mad panic yesterday morning probably didn't help. Finally realised what day it was at about 10:00 last night...oooops.

It's gone very quiet. A bit too quiet, to be honest. Limbo is not a nice place to be, especially when you're left wondering if you should put everything else on hold on the off-chance that it all works out for you in the end. 
Having said that, I'm not sure exactly what I'd be putting on hold. Jon's ""leave it with me"" idea has been as successful as it was last time he said that (ie, not at all successful), and I'm left with the option of either putting my trust in Ruskin (I know, a horrendous prospect) or just saying ""fuck it"" and going out on a wing and a prayer, going for it, and hoping for the best.

I was even wandering round the house singing ""Whole Again"" (yes, the Atomic Kitten song) earlier.

Yesterday's stroll round town with Kirsty led to some interesting purchases. ""A Star Is Born"" (Judy Garland version) on DVD and a CD of Tim Rice songs, to name but two.

Very interesting cross-ocean phone call tonight. I'm reminded of an episode of Seinfeld. A possible trip to London, then. The place where it all started, you could say. Certainly the place where it all became a lot more real.

At the end of the month, when I can afford to do random shopping again, I'm definitely going to go back onto the HMV Japan site and buy those Guitar Vader CDs. That band is INSANE - but in a very good, entertaining way. 
Actually, might just had a word with Kirsty and see about getting copies for now.

Driftrun were good on Saturday night. Very good, actually. And they played the stuff I wanted them to play, which is always a bonus. Singer bloke needs to rid himself of his Liam Gallagher obsession though. Ida was really good too, although we got there late so missed most of the set.

But anyway...Christmas.

Christmas Eve was a lot more fun than I thought it would be, to be honest. Went in to work in the morning, and we ended up leaving at about midday - an earlier finish than usual, even by Christmas Eve standards - and went for a few pints with Kirsty. Which turned into a lot of pints and a shopping trip, naturally. Back home after that, and finished wrapping the presents that weren't already done.

As for the day itself, twas a very good one. Nothing out of the ordinary - went to J and Lou's first thing in the morning and then across to Liverpool in the afternoon, but it was enjoyable. 
Now have another picture to hang on the wall, and a lot more books to read. 
Oh, and more socks, pants, and deodorants than I know what to do with.
Weather was horrendous, so much so that we didn't even go out ""for some fresh air"" on Christmas night. Just stayed in and drank a bit, watched some tv, and fell asleep.
No prizes for guessing what JD was watching before he went to sleep though...

I want to get one of those Nun Bowling games that Laura had.
It rocked!

Then it was back to work.
Oh, the joy.
But not before a strange dream, which involved me being in a shop and the tall, slim redhead girl from Catherine's team at work (whose name I didn't know but have since found out is ""Holly"", very Christmassy) being in front of me in the queue and holding everyone up because she was paying by cheque.
Like I said, strange.

Can't say I'm looking forward to New Years Eve. To be honest, I never do. But this year in particular I've just been on a post-Christmas downer. Not entirely sure why. I think it's probably something to do with the time of year, reflecting on what's gone on over the past 12 months - over the past 30 years, actually - and doing more thinking than is strictly necessary (or good for me).
I'm guessing that NYE will consist of me being at home with a couple of bottles of wine, a takeaway, and that ludicrous pile of DVDs that haven't been watched yet.

But if those plans HAD been cancelled, if everything had been turned upside down and the world had gone topsy turvy for a bit while everyone got their heads straight and got used to the bizarro-world-ness of it all...
There's someone who's hurting now, who wouldn't have been hurting.
Actually, there's two people who are hurting now, who wouldn't have been hurting.
As for the third person...the Christmas spirit prevents me from thinking too much about what would be happening there."

"event","I love that feeling when you hear a new song, and just can't stop listening to it, playing the same track on the CD over and over again for hours, days, weeks.
I absolutely, completely, and utterly LOVE the new Ginger single. 

Wolverhampton was INCREDIBLE! In fact, the whole trip was incredible. It was great to catch up with Jim and Vicky again. 
I sometimes feel that things have changed, and not necessarily for the better, where we're concerned. Stupid to think that, of course. It's not a case of changing for the worse, it's just a case of growing up and having separate lives. When you're older and living in different places, you're not going to be as close as you were when you were kids at school, spending every available minute either at each other's houses listening to music or in the park playing football. Actually, the fact that Jim, Baz and I are still as close as we are is pretty damn impressive.
Wolfsbane were hilarious. They HAVE to do a full tour of their own!
All the familiar faces were there, and a couple of unfamiliar ones too. Jason and Trudi, Rich (that was a conversation that needed to be had, and I'm glad we cleared the air), Keith...even bumped into Becky in the takeaway afterwards.
The t-shirt for Steff went down really well - it was slightly bizarre having people coming up to me in the toilets saying they wanted to sign it though, I must admit. Will send it to her after the Christmas rush is over.
I really don't need to say how brilliant The Wildhearts were. I've bored you all far too often on that subject, and I really wouldn't be saying anything that I haven't said already.
But why is it that I always end up getting lost when I go to Wolves?
The venue brought back some memories of the last time I was there...

Thunder on Wednesday night was amazing as well. The inflatable santa's and snowmen, a couple of weird and wonderful covers (""Delilah"", anyone?), the two backing singing girls were both lovely and tuneful (always an advantage, obviously), and it was just a perfect night.

Kirsty seems to have attached herself to me and Tom at work. Seems that we were wrong about her (although I still insist that she needs to start supporting a different team), and I'm actually pretty glad about that. Her and Michael might be coming to the Ginger gig in February, along with Pepper, Daz, and whoever else turns up. Already looking forward to it. Pepper's ordered a couple of AntiProduct CDs off the net as well - that meeting with Milena much have had quite an impact!

Cards from S&J, Baddy, Laura (thank you soooooooo much for the CD and the book - great minds obviously think alike because I was going to get YOU one of his as well, until the ""I don't know which ones she's already got"" thought entered my head, so I decided it was safer to stick with the CD!), and I can't stop laughing at that photo of Scottie wearing a santa outfit. 
Strange that I should find something like that so amusing, you may say, until I tell you that Scottie is a dog...

This won't be the last update before Christmas...hopefully."

"event","I sometimes find myself people-watching. It's a particularly good way of spending the time on a train journey. Depending on the length of the journey, I even occasionally find myself giving these strangers names and lives. 
Take yesterday as an example. 
I ended up deciding that a woman in her 50s, a bit plain looking, used to be quite glam in her younger days until her husband came home from work one night and packed his bags, telling her that he was leaving her for her sister, and that since then she's had very few friends, choosing instead to live in a house full of cats because they're the only ""friends"" she feels she can trust.
I decided that she should be called Linda, by the way.
There was also a girl who I decided should be called Amy. She was a dance teacher, who'd always wanted to be a dancer herself, in the big shows in the West End theatres, but she wasn't quite good enough. 
So now she taught kids to dance, in the hope that one day one of her pupils could live the dream for her.
It was then, after these two lives had popped into my head, that I realised that I very rarely give people HAPPY lives when I'm inventing new worlds for them to inhabit. 

Night out with Pepper, Rob and Little Jo was very entertaining. Ended up staying in the same pub all night and not wandering about like we were planning to, but when there's entertainment like that on hand for free, why go wandering elsewhere? 
A crap DJ playing the kinds of songs you hear at truly naff weddings (although, disappointingly, when Jo requested ""Wig Wam Bam"" he said he didn't have it) was the soundtrack to a night which included an old bearded tramp - who we named Catweazle - asking Rob if he wanted to go out and steal some cars with him, and a drunk barman who didn't know how to make a white wine spritzer and who was incapable of placing a drink on the bar without spilling half of it.

3 lovely bottles of red wine.
I wonder how long they'll last.

Thought for the day:
It says a lot about human nature that morals and beliefs can go out of the window so quickly when it's our own chance of happiness that's at stake."

"event","I must be. I've started to think about the past a lot.

Had a dream last night where I bumped into Jenny Bertie and Emma Roy in some club somewhere. Possibly inspired by the girl on the train (who ended up working behind the bar in one of the pubs we went in) who had long wavy hair like Emma's used to be (and might still be for all I know, I haven't seen her since we moved down here). For some reason, during this meeting, I was wearing a sun hat and carrying a walking stick. 
No, I've got no idea either.

Saw Sarah on Wednesday and we FINALLY cleared the air. It was a conversation I thought we needed to have - I needed to have - and there were things that I felt that I needed to say. I was relieved, I have to admit, when she said she felt the same, that everything that went on was as much her fault as mine.
Hopefully now things can be almost normal again. 
I hate the word ""closure"", it sounds far too Dawson's Creek for me.
But you know what I mean.

Kel has been getting the same bus as me to work in the mornings for most of this week, and she said that she just suddenly realised that it's been 10 years now that we've known each other.
""We're not old enough to have known each other for that long!""
It does seem strange.

I also thought last night about the girl at Sheffield station.
I still kick myself about that."

"event","So.
Where to start?

Attempted to get tickets for Thunder at City Hall tomorrow, failed miserably because we left it far too late as usual. However, an interesting development in the last hour or so, Kat has suggested that we go to the Rock City gig the week before Christmas, and she'll see if Harry can sort out backstage passes for us.
So that's a pretty good place to start really, isn't it?

Computer at work has died. 
By which I mean it's well and truly fucked, and I've lost everything.
Shouldn't be too difficult to replace some of it, but other bits are going to be damn near impossible to get hold of again.
Shit.

I think they think I've forgotten about it.
They're wrong.

Christmas ""do"" on Friday.
All going rather well until one of those annoying ""once a year"" drinkers fell into me and caused red wine to go all over the white shirt I was wearing. Fortunately for them, I managed to dash home from town and get it in the wash before it could do any permanent damage, but it's fair to say that I wasn't impressed.

Lancashire Hotpots were fantastic.
The beginning of probably the busiest month for gigs that I've had for a long time. Just before Christmas too. Splendid timing, eh?
Kaiser Chiefs tomorrow. 
Kid Acne on Thursday.
TheSTART next Wednesday.
The Wildhearts on the following Monday.
Possibly Thunder two days after that.
So I might not be home much!

Sigh.
I miss her."

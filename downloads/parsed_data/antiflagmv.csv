                                   It'll make you laugh so hard you'll cry
                             And lookin' into the black you make me so far past sick
                                   Lookin' into your eyes I wish you'd die
                                                No more dead
                                                No more dead

                                 Well I've seen the crosses burnt and holy
                              And the people they all come down they're screaming
                                           ""Hey man, it's a fix!""
                          And I looked into the cause in which, you were striving towards
                              And I thought, though of the wasted, the wasted youth..
                                               No more dead

                                    His life is stolen, yes it's gone
                     Into the black of the night can't you see it was no fault of his own
                                   Trapped in a slum, bred into a slum,
                                Killing his own instead of rich white men
                                 And he's never gonna escape from it now,
                                    Because it's over, and he's dead
                                                 The end

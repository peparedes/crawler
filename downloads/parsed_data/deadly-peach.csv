"event","Right, so.... Tokyo is getting boring already.  After the little bit of Hollow activity in my first week down here, there's been LESS than nothing going on.  I think I've done <i>maybe</i> two burials, and that's just because I was out looking for stuff.

Thank goodness this mission ends next week, and I can get back to being in my division.  You new recruits ready for some of this?  I know you all like to see how high up you can go before we send you to the 4th, but after all this I won't be holding back.  Get ready for it.  We're gonna fire it up around the 11th when Momo-chan gets back!"

"event","Yo!  It's me again.  Things are boring down here in Tokyo, and I'm hoping they pick up soon, otherwise I'm gonna be bored like crazy for the rest of this mission.

For all of you important people, uh, situation normal, minimal hollow activity, blah blah.

Anybody ever played this... ""basketball"" thing?  Looks fun.  I think I might give it a try.

Number of burger chains visited: 3 and counting.

I haven't seen that guy again yet, but I haven't been around the Karakura area in a few days.  I'm thinking about tracking him down just so I'll have somebody to talk to.  Seriously, it's really boring down here.

"event","Right, so.  I met this guy down here in Tokyo, in Karakura Town and everything...  And he's not a shinigami.  And he's got a journal.  Nobody gave me a note about this before I came down here.

This is me calmly asking for an explanation.  Like, am I supposed to mess with him, or what?  Logic says he's fine, and he doesn't seem too strong, so I'm not that worried, but... Yeah."

"event","The best thing about getting sent down here on a mission is the FOOD.  Period.  I don't care how bad dealing with all the humans is, I don't care about chasing souls every which way...  I get a gigai, I get BURGERS, and you get a happy, happy Momo.

You guys that are all stuffy, give it a rest!  I'm not gonna come down here and eat all that refined food and crap.  I want my big, fat, greasy burgers, and I want them in bulk.  That's the other good thing about this being dead business...  No weight gain!  Still, I bet things are pretty boring up there without old Momo-chan around to liven it up.  No need to worry, I'll be back soon and we can get back to my daily routine of beating everyone who thinks they can challenge my seat.  Seriously, taichou, when is that gonna stop?!"

Lewis helped me move in some stuff, the room is slowly coming together, i bought a TV stand at Magic Johnson's thrift store its just what i needed. We walked to Amoeba, Upper Haight isn't all that far, but the hill between me and it is kinda arduous.

Figured out another way to get home from home from downtown. My cousin keeps telling me i'll get lost and end up in Hunter's Point or something. But it hasn't happened yet, so suck on that you University ho! 

Its weird coming from Santa Cruz where there's so few food options, to here where there's too many, where i can't decide. Most would be trial runs. Fat Slice though, oh baby. As good as ever.

There's a Rilo Kiley concert this thursday which i didn't know about. I found this on craigslist: 

""I have an extra ticket for the Rilo Kiley show on Thursday (9/6) at the Warfield. Any takers? I moved to SF within the past year and, although my friends here are great, I haven't found any drop-everything-and-see-a-show-with-me types. I am a relatively normal person (at least, I think so) who loves all types of music...and I'm always looking out for a fellow band nerd.""

Its ever so tempting, but the person is 32, so i dunno, thats old. But damn. Free tickets would be sweet, and its my birthday damnit!

#1. Chelsea is in town for the summer. Talk about a pleasant surprise! We hadn't been talking for awhile so i was worried that we'd grown so far apart our friendship was a thing of the past. But no! We're getting along better than ever and i'm totally reminded of why we were so close in high school.

#2. Top Chef+ Rock of Love. Oh baby.

#3. 
Kevin: Ooh soda! Can I have some?
Me: Yea, go for it, although it might be a little flat.
Kevin(cheery): Its ok, i can enjoy the tiniest amount of bubbles!
Me: Actually, i lied. Its totally flat.
Kevin(even more enthusiastically): mmmmm! Sweeet wataah!

well, this probably isn't that funny when read, but its just an example of Kevin's constant positivity and hilarity that amuses me day after day.

"event","""A police pursuit of a van whose driver was intoxicated and wanted on parole violations ended tragically Saturday night when the van ran a red light and plowed into a car in East Oakland, killing the car's driver and a passenger, police said Sunday.

The Alameda County coroner identified the victims as Jessica Marie Castaneda-Rodriguez, 25, and Salvador Nieves Jr., 21, both of Oakland. Castaneda-Rodriguez was the driver.""

Salvador was my best friend in middle school. I kept telling myself i would call him up some time, never did.

He was probably the only reason i didn't get my ass beat in middle school, because even the tough ass kids respected him and wouldn't try anything when we were hanging out. Probably the most street smart kid i knew, if anyone was going to survive out on 90th ave, it was Sal. 

He was also really well liked by the girls. A friend of mine ""dated"" him for about a month, but all that entailed was them holding hands during lunch and not speaking to eachother for 45 mins each day. Probably the most dysfunctional relationship i've ever seen. After school, they would both complain to me ""why doesn't he/she talk to me?"". It was espeically strange since both of them were pretty talkative otherwise.

Amazing soccer player. Never played with us at lunch because he thought he was too good for us. We thought he was being pretentious, but when he finally did play, he scored like 7 goals.

Whenever I would miss a Simpsons episode, he would re-enact it in great detail the next morning during break. I think his favorite moment was when Homer wrote Marge a ""love letter"" in the form of a postcard from a brewery. The voice over of homer drunkenly saying 

""Maybe it's the beer talking Marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. They've got these big chewy pretzels here [drunken rambling] FIVE DOLLARS?!? Get outta here.""

while she reads it is ridiculous. For weeks, everytime one of us would should yell ""Five dollars!?"" we'd be laughing on the ground again.

I didn't talk to him all that much during the later years of High School, but I heard that he had started working Spanish Speaking Citizens Foundation and was involved in Oakland Fund for Children and Youth. He was never all that into school, but more into after school programs."

"event","blah. I was planning to write my parents a letter telling them how much I appreciate them for christmas(i do, even if i bitch about them a lot), but they're all pissed at me because i didn't do anything for my mom's fake birthday(short story, but i'm lazy). its never been a big deal at all, so i don't know why they're all riled up this time. But yea, now if i write a ltter they'll think i only wrote it because they were mad at me(perhaps encouraging them to be mad at me more?), and we can't have that. this shit happens every time i think about doing something nice for them, they get pissed at me, and then its all awkward. Fools. They're missing out."

"event","i suck at college. My GPA falling faster than the Thai Bhat in 97. See? i learned stuff.Anyone remember that Simpsons episode where Bart fails a test by 1 point, then says one fact of random knowledge and the teacher gives him an extra point so he passes? How come real life isn't like that? baaaah.

In other news, i really want to get some stuff for my walls, and this picture is what i want most:

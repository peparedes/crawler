Why?  

Because then Alex wouldn't sound so godsdamn spoiled.  

It's like living with a furry.

Actually, it EXACTLY like living with a furry.  Furries were ruined becuase people who wanted to actually live out hte potential of the fandom made the mistake of inviting and encouraging retards and perverts and no one spanked or punished them for being retardedand kicked them out of the fandom.  The only attempts were made when it was far, far too late.  Furries started expanding in practice and beleif and as the wars got worse, the worst of all emerged from the battle, yet none of the smaller factions have united to drive the foe away. I'm talking about Lifestylers.

It's exactly like that.  Alex bitches and whines about the 'good old day's when everything he found was perfect and everything catered to his needs for organization and categorization. He wants a wizard to wave a magic wand and set up a community of good writers just for him.  

He's not going to try to get writers together, or look in all he dark cobwebby corners of hte inernet because he's done that already.  He's not going to do anymore work because there's no hope in finding anyone NEW.  It's not like you can keep trying and someday something might happen if you work at it.

So I hate the internet tha wasn't retarded to begin with.  Tes, fuck off 80's and 90's that wasn't pages of unicorns or MC Hammer cartoons.  Fuck you!"

Since I'm also clearing stuff off my computer, I got rid of all the sims1 hacks I had.

Today I have to rearrange my CD folder because some CD's fell out.  Lo and behold: sims1 CD1.  Plus several CDs I thought I'd lost months ago. It turns out that when Alex borrows my CDs to listen to them 'put them back in the right order' means 'put them randomly in the middle, surrounded by blank pages so I'll never look there for them again.'"

But now I'm coming to something big.

I'm thinking of quitting the comic company. It has done nothing for me for four long years, and whatever promises it held have evaporated. An artist that was supposed to start in August has no phone and never got a contract.  Now my boss won't answer his myspace messages, list his address, and had his phone line disconnected.

"event","For those reading this who don't know Andromeda, take 'Hercules: the Legendary Journeys,' put it in space, and give someone else the role of 'guy who takes his shirt off for fanservice.'

For those reading this who don't know Farscape, google it 'cause it's too hard to explain.

However, the cast is basically the same bunch of archetypes.  Whereas Andromeda is so bad it's funny, Farscape is so real it's funny 'cause people are molesting muppets.

Now to see who wins in wrongness...

Chiana vs. Trance Gemini

Both are the resident Rikku.  Both are silly, usually.  Chiana is some sort of escapee, seemingly form a Calvin Klein planet. She always stands like she's trying to use a urinal while recovering from novacane injections in her shoulders.  She keeps staring at things with a a look made of a mix of 'Mixed Nyquil and some illegal drug' and 'mystical constipation.'  She'll hump anything she can't steal, and steal anything she can't hump.  Her backside is sexy, though.
Trance on the other hand is a perfect Rikku.  She's silly, she's a ditz, she doesn't understand why everyone has to be nasty, but she's a decent warrior.  she has trouble explaining things. She's bouncy.  She's nonchalant about a lot of things that would disturb us.  She's diagonally parked in a parallel universe, and that's why she understands and doesn't at the same time.  I think she's fine purple and don't understand why they had to turn her yellow later. She's one of the most believable empaths I've ever seen in sci-fi. If you get too serious about it, it fucks up, but like Rikku, if you get to serious about anything with her it fucks something up for her; especially her concentration.  Also, she's got a job.  

Winner: Trance Gemini

Rev Bem vs. Pau Zotoh Zhaan

Rev Bem looks like that hairball I plumbed out of a shower train one day that looked like a drowned tribble.  In fact, he IS a tribble. He's a humanoid tribble with most teeth that a shark that converted to some interstellar version of Buddhism-Taoism with Christianity references.  He at least has the dignity to admit he's not that important by seemingly having an actual role on the ship and not showing up in episodes he'd just clutter up the scene in and get in the way of the plot.
Pau Zotoh Zhaan is a blue human priest with sexy glow-under-UV spots.  That's it though.  She cheek humps most everyone on the ship in season one, but mostly she chants gibberish while waving crystals around.  She sort of has a job as chemist/doctor, but she's amazingly slow.  I'd trust Lister to fix my wounds before her.

Winner: Tie.  As much as Rev is convenient, he sucks later one. 'Sides, muppet-molestation is so not getting old.

Dylan Hunt vs. John Crichton
Dylan is Hercules.  You can't deny this.  They barely changed Kevin's hair for this role.  He's a rather lame-ass captain and he makes very few captainy decisions.  He's not bad, but I keep forgetting he's captain.  
John is sort of the captain of the ship.  While Pilot controls Moya, John gives orders the most, even if they're 'What is it, why haven't we shot it, and what'd it do?' or 'Shut up.'  He also save asses most in the ship.  The again, with three useless people, a muppet, and two people who aren't that god with teams, no wonder.

Winner: John Crichton

Beka Valentine vs. Aeryn Sun

Both are the resident semi-cardboard amazon.  Beka has an actual life and enough background to care about her and explain her bitchy attitude.  Other tha that, she does little.  Then again, there's little plot involving her, so she's not Lara Lookitmyboobs-Croft or Boringaswatchingmoldform-Janeway.
Aeryn Sun is a nice straight man for John's jokes, expert at weaponry and interstellar stuff.  No life, though.

Winner: Aeryn.  Much more useful in space.  She can actually shoot.

Tyr Anasazi vs Ka D'argo
Okay, dipshit name first off.  Tyr also has the stupidest background as to why he's an alien (sort of) that looks exactly like a human.  He looks great without a shirt.  As much of a Klingon as he is, he seems more like he found Jesus and doesn't want to share.
Ka D'argo is supposedly a warrior. He carries a sword, but that's it.  He doesn't beat thing up much, he just seems to have bad taser-like halitosis.  

Winner: Ka D'argo

Rommie vs Pilot
Rommie is somehow short for Andromeda.  She's a good ship Ai, but she hardly ACTS like a warship despite the fact that she reminds people that she is one.  She has the hots for the captain, but somehow it seems believable.
Pilot isn't the ship, he's just connected to it, speaks for it, keep sit doing allt eh useless irrelevant crap no one cares about.  He's like Scotty of 'The tax machine is btoken!' and 'She cannae take much more!' Half the time something's still broken and he doesn't handle much fo the defense stuff.

Winner: Rommie.  'Sides, she's hot.

Winner: Farscape.  Apparently a ship full of bums humping and killing muppets is the most fun.  Wait, dur!"

*Casseiopeia's chair

*Final Project bird-thingy

*Toy Batcave

A paint toy bat cave.  It was all orange and brown before. Now it's black, like batcaves should be.

*Fake blood

-If anyone wants blood ink, I'll give you what's left of what I have

Why is Baxter Stockman 12 years old?

Why does Baxter's inventions look like tonka toys?

Why does Shredder always carry stockman?  Is he Shredder's uke?  He seems pretty used to it.

If Shredder knows April is linked to the turtles shouldn't she be the main target more often?

What does Shredder do in his free time?  How does he know the exact location of a carnival?

After Shredder got a car why did he have to get a cheese car?

Why did Shredder trade Stockman as a flunkie for Rock Steady and Bebop? Stockman may just hide under tha table when a fight starts; but he can make gadgets, program machines fast, and he can find stuff.  Give him time and he'll either make or find a ray gun.  If you need a soda, he'll find you one or at least find you change.  Rock Steady and Bebop would just break things, including the soda you wanted.

Why does Shredder have a body-builder physique, show off his muscles when no one is watching/cares, have a nice tan and long, shapely legs?

If Shredder can kick the turtle's asses at any time, why doesn't he?

If you have a questionable sexuality, don't wrestle on top of other men in compromising situations. Especially if the other guy is a rat.

For all that sharp metal, all Shredder does is work fire hydrants and maybe open a soda can or bottle. Why?

Splinter is the only person/thing I've seen that loses his pants, but keeps his shirt when he transforms.

Questionable sexuality or not, don't summon one-eyed tentacle monsters.

Why does no one lock any doors with secret labs everywhere?  Especially in New York?

Robot cops are good cooks

Alien devices look like butt-plugs. If you or you're flunky has a questionable sexuality, don't let them play with it or put it on your belt.

Sure Krang is a disembodied brain-monster.  Sure he rules a lot of people on dimension X.  This still gives him no reason to ride around in the crotch or a gay robot with a tiny head and phallic knees.

Why does Krang shower with the robot body?  Why does he put a towel around his waist when the panties don't come off the robot (I hope)?  Why does the robot have a shower cap on it's tiny head when it has no hair?

I really don't like the way Splinter looks at me.

Michelangelo, do not say 'Let's get it on!' and smack the punk warthog in the butt

Where'd Shredder get a mind-control collar?  Or a cage that falls from the ceiling?  I think he's been doing wierd stuff with Rock Steady and Bebop.  

When April turns into a cat furry, her boobs get bigger, and her crotch and ass get tighter?

Why does Shredder keep his cellphone in his pants?  Why oes it never ring?  ...No wonder he's always slightly bent forward?"

House of Wax
Phantom of the Opera
Saw
Predator (starring Arnold Schwaren-whatever the hell you spell it)
Conan the Barbarian (starring him too).

Summaries:
I don't get it.  Why are you boring me to death?  How the hell is that an explanation?  How hard is it to look up siamese twins?
One of the killers would look hot if it weren't for the modified overalls and the salvation army sweater.  Oh, and he needs another knife.  He looks like he's creeping around to get a sammich (he needs one too).

So damn dul the actors were already bored before they filmed it. I think they all did it for community work because prisons were full.  Even the scriptwriter who obviously riped off Andrew Lloyd Weber (who sucks in the first place.  And why does the phantom live in a garage sale?

I don't get it.  

Cool.  Even if the predator looks like a kinligon with a mask on for most of the movie.

Cooler than the dumbass horror movies, but Cohen can beat the crap out of him and he's Conan's damn parody.

Rule no one ever follows about creepy guys in masks:  The guy has to look creepier without the mask than with it.  The guy in House of Wax (what I could see of one second of it) looks like he got mugged.  He doesn't need a half-mask in the first place, let alone a whole piece of crap.  His hair covers it up, and it's only one third of his face.

Also, he's not creepy.  He looks like a bum.  A nice bum.  A cool bum.  I live near creepier bums.  Plus his melting wax face looks more like that white thing from scream 3, so that's not scary.

The phantom looks like he fell on the sidewalk and scrped his face.  For him, No Wig after Wig looks worse than No Mask Vs. No mask.

PS: How'd the phantom get a damn horse down there?"

"event","Tips on how to draw people naked and/or having sex:
While tentacles are a non-no, cellphones don't seem as obvious. Or lamps.
Do not draw the vagina as if it were taped on and fell off.
Breasts do not have corners.  Not 2, not 1, 0.
Sneaking up on women with a 2x4 in your pants is liable to get you sent to prison if not shot, not a date.
To follow up on the last statement, please do not take said 2-foot long penis with the circumference of a baseball and shove something in it.  Especially with the same expression as if you were contentedly making a bowl of cereal.
Penises do not glow.  Neither do vaginas.
Bending people's legs apart so much you've broken both the legs AND the pelvis (and even the spine in some cases) is NOT sexy.
Last, but not least: Neither butts nor breasts should looked like they're fille dwith cottage cheese."

3.  All the Guado Blitzball players are androgynous.
4.  Tidus sits there and whines a lot.  Auron bitches.  Seymour's nothing but a bucket of angst and trying to hide it.  Auron and Tidus are more realistic, but oyu always have some guy trying to hide his angst, which is bigger and more obvious than a day-glo-green elephant.
5. Pointy ears.  Okay, this isn't anime, but when was the last time Square had an entire race of people with pointy ears?  People had come to the conclusion that pointy ears=tall effeminate uke before they came to the conclusion that most of the population should be able to read.

Usually I'm running away from overly nonsensical stuff, like giant fish or a dinosaur and its usually only after me.

This time we were running away from vampires (althought the bees were nonsensical I guess). For some dipshit reason I stick around so the vampire can get me and the others (who I don't even know) can get away.

Another weird thing is everyone but a few vampires were like eleven years old.  Including me.  The older vampirs were in their forties, so it was like a school got weird or something, with vampire teachers.

Half way through, everyone was really confsued because the government wanted to cure all teh vampires if they could, rather than flamethrower them all to death.  Even as a vampire who realy didn't want to be a vampire, I thought the government was being stupid.

I guess it's better than the usual evil fish dream. I wish I knew what it all meant."

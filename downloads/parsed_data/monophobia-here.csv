"event","Everyday is filled with reading, watching shows online and maybe another activity. This was nice the first week, but I don't know if I can stand it for the rest of the summer. My sister invites me to go out with her and her friends sometimes, but I wish i had my girls to do our own thing. I hung out with some people still in Reno and its just very new with them, so kind of uncomfortable. 

I was invited back to join the VK colorguard this summer and if you had talk to me yesterday, I would have sounded like I was already packed and in California. I decided against it last summer, because I wanted to spend the summer with my friends, but we know how last summer&nbsp;was less than&nbsp;stellar. I regretted not taking the chance at this completely different lifestyle. But this whole semester I had been getting emails from the directors asking me just to&nbsp;come out for&nbsp;one camp.&nbsp;Colorguard still inspired me, but I didn't see how it would&nbsp;fit in my life. When I got another email&nbsp;yesterday though, my Reno residency was not what I wanted&nbsp;to be doing all summer, but&nbsp;I think I'm going to turn it down again; it was something I&nbsp;really enjoyed in high school and I do miss performing, but VK was an easy out of Reno, not really what I wanted to do. This empty summer could potentially be filled with volunteering and spent outdoors, not repeating moves in the unforgiving sun and directors yelling for better. 

Today I spent running errands I had been putting off, looking up volunteer work and filling out even more job applications. When I have no direction or immediate goals to achieve, my life sits still, but I'm moving again. I&nbsp;hope to achieve skills applicable for my future job and memories of spending my time benefitting others. 

Miss and Love you guys!"

"event","Within the first month of being here I&nbsp;was approach by a guy in Tony's building: 
&quot;I see you everywhere Lisa, I should get your number.&quot; I was blind to this tricky way to get my number, so I&nbsp;obliged. He texted me a few times to go out to coffee or dinner. I told him I&nbsp;was busy with sorority stuff so I&nbsp;don't have the time. He was one of the top football players in the state, but he is definitely not for me. 

One of the first times out with my sorority sister,&nbsp;they had been playing a game of kings cup where the rule is ' you must state a sexual secret before you drink.' Mind you I'm not playing, because I was the DD, but I'm still harassed for a secret, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;admit I'm a&nbsp;virgin.&nbsp;This guy is across the room nodding to the door, so we could talk, I end up having to go out with a sorority sister minutes later. He follows:
&quot;Hey, my name is Cedric. You know, I respect you. I&nbsp;think that's tight your a virgin. Is it regilious?...&quot; I tell him no, but I&nbsp;justified it with explaining that I&nbsp;have high morals. &quot;Oh that's tight, that's tight. So I was thinking we could get to know eachother better. Maybe I could take you out to dinner, or something?&quot; I lightly put that initiation week was coming up and that I would be busy with the sorority. &quot;Yeah, I understand. But maybe we could go for lunch then?&quot; I give him a maybe, and get his number, because I'm not about to give my number out. When my sorority sister and I&nbsp;leave she tells me, &quot;Lisa! He has a kid!&quot;

Mere hours ago I was out with my sorority sister Tayler, at her boyfriend's fraternity party. I&nbsp;met Mario before at a greek social and thought he was cute and pretty funny. He comes over and we have a silly little conversation, until it gets to sex. He would not believe me when I admitted I&nbsp;was virgin. He nudges me:
&quot;Well do you want to have sex?&quot; I&nbsp;reply with simply that its not high not my to do list, if it happens with the right person great, but I don't want to just 'get it over with.' &quot;Want to have sex tonight?....With me?....back at the fraternity house?&quot; I&nbsp;couldnt help but laugh and tell him no. As I'm leaving, he throws in &quot;Alright Lisa, We'll fuck later. Bye.&quot; 

Wow. hahaha, Silly college boys.

Yeah, I havent had amazing revelations, but I do have more funny stories! :] I felt like these were necessary to post. haha!

Oh! today was initiation! I&nbsp;am officially a Sigma Kappa. I wore my first greek letter sweater today to sorority family dinner. :]"

I had a dream last night that the penny was actually unlucky. Horrible things kept happening in the dream and it would be blamed on the penny. 

I woke up this morning and my roommate told me she has pink eye. I get to dance class, fall during across the floors and now I cant walk on that foot very well.

"event","University of Nevada is exactly what I&nbsp;needed. 

My classes are useful and I can see the point of why I am taking them. My professors are all interesting and caring people, all hoping we pass. My books are completely crappy either, some are actually funny to read.

I'm a pledge for Sigma Kappa. Only 6 out of the 26 rushes received bids, I feel proud. Bid Day was Saturday and I really love these girls already. Some I made instant bonds with during the rush events and some I'm just meeting and finding them to be amazing. I feel bad, I talked so much crap about Sigma Kappa before I even came up here and they by far are the most genuine sorority girls. After chatting at the house for a few hours we went bowling and we all suck, so it was fun. :] Once I got back to my dorm, one of my sisters put that sign by my door! It was so sweet and I&nbsp;couldn't help but leave it up while i put down my stuff. Just my luck though, Melissa came back from work and kind of threw her skis down. Once I heard her, i threw open the door and ripped off the sign.

She rushed with me and got a bid from another sorority, but decided to rush again in the fall for Sigma Kappa. I don't see her fitting in with the girls, but who knows. She seemed pissed at first when I got my bid and when I received my first Sigma Kappa purse, shirt, button, and keychain. Hopefully it will blow over soon.

Tony got me sick yesterday! So tomorrow at formal pledging I might just be a pale nauseated girl in white. 

I really love it up here. I&nbsp;just wish I could tell you all the stories without rambling on and on and on. But when I see you all next you will be rolling with laughter! :]

Love you girls!

One of the rush event questions- &quot;Why did you decide to go greek?&quot;
answer- &quot;I had a group of girls that I did so much with in high school and I miss that ability to just call one and just go out...&quot;"

I feel a little bad for the bad reputation I have given her when I tell people about her, but Johnn and I admitted that the people we dislike when we first meet them are ones we like the most. So in due time I will most likely write a silly post about how we get along and are actually very similar. <br /><br />This is a list of things I know about my roommate:<br />-She is a kid ski instructor<br />-She has a younger sister<br />-She doesn't watch TV<br />-She is very republican<br />-She is kind of quiet, but not unfriendly<br />-She is pleasant most of the time<br />-She doesn't spend much time in the room<br />-She has some odd products like organic toothpaste<br />-We don't have the same taste in music, but I'm exposing her to it anyways :] hehe</p>Class starts tomorrow and I'm excited :]<br /><br /><strong><br />Hello college life, I'm ready now!</strong>"

"event","I made the trip up to Reno with my whole family. Everyone was grouchy, but I found the trip slighty interesting. Once we arrived at my sister's freezing house, my parents left us to unpack the truck. After help from a few of my sister's friends everything was finally inside. Last night my sister and I just stayed in and watched a little TV, but ended up passing out early. Today was lots of little errands like grocery shopping and seeing a family friend. 

Tomorrow morning is my orientation and when my parents will go back to vegas to completely clean out my house and then off the continent they will go.

I&nbsp; will be more excited when I will meet my roommate, start classes and see all the boys again. Right now, without any distractions my mind wanders to all the things that are changing and I just get upset.

"event","<p><br />While at work, some of my kids and I cam up with fun ways to study, hopefully you guys can use them :]</p><p>Jenga- write study questions (one, two or even four)&nbsp;on each block. Before you are allowed to add the block to the top of the tower, you must answer one question right. If you cannot answer any of the questions, you have to be able to put it back into the tower.</p><p>Uno- Make each color into a section of your book. Make each number into a vocab or concept from that section. To switch from color to another color you can use the number on the cards, or you can vocally define the connection between the two. Ex:&nbsp;if one section is about the atmosphere, but i have a different section, but its a&nbsp;chemical that is in the air, i can put it down.</p><p>Mancala- before putting a pebble into your pile, you must answer a question from a pile of questions you have made about the chapter. If you do not answer the question correctly, you must put that pebble into the other persons pile and continue on with your hand of pebbles.</p><p>Guess Who- change the faces into vocabulary words</p><p>Spoons- you must four a kind but it has to be one word, their definition, same word, same definition. Or if you really want, you can one word, their definition and then another word and its definition. And then once you have a pair or two, grab a spoon! If you don, but someone has grabbed a spoon, grab one!</p>TWISTER- put post-its with questions on them and before you can use that color spot, you must choose a question and answer it correct. if you cannot, you have to move to another spot and answer a question there.<br /><br />i hope these come in handy next time your dreading a boring study session :]"

The ride there&nbsp;was sleep&nbsp;until we hit McDs with expensive parfaits..&nbsp;I did my Britney dancer-ise for Megan and Darlena on the bus. Cali was hella foggy in the morning. Seeing almost the whole team&nbsp;in line for Space Mountain was pretty funny. SHS Colorguard cannot be tamed! I wore one contact the whole day, it was awful.&nbsp;I couldn't stop laughing at Krissy and her hysterical screaming. Megan will soon be selling ""Chufall"" from&nbsp;a Ferris Wheel near you. =] Darlena and I fell asleep at Pizza Port. After going on Buzz Lightyear and some semi-hot cocoa the whole team met up and we walked back to the hotel. Megan got to sleep on the prison cot.&nbsp;<br /><br />Saturday-In the morning we went to the UBER expensive IHOP, geez. Once back on the bus, the team decided to shop, so we went to Balboa beach, but didnt go near the beach. The ride home was pretty much sleep since the tv infront of me decided to keep turning off and shit. Then we had a super sadies talk/next year colorguard talk which got me all sentimental, ugh. After calming down for a few hours, I went to Sean's cast party of a thing. Finally got some time with the theatre, except there were some hella creeps! After all the amazing people left and the creeps were still there, Tony and I cleaned up around them and sang our little hearts out. I went home around 12:30<br /><br />Sunday- I worked on sadies stuff for hours!&nbsp;Finally met up with Cam and helped him clean his room. Sean came over for half an hour and then disappeared with a movie&nbsp;in hand. Cam and I had a nice conversation and snack. Finally came home around 2:30.&nbsp;<br /><br />Monday-Then i went on a job hunt, but spent an hour in Learning in Fun. =] After walking around my house for a few hours, I met up with my sister at the airport for an hour. She laughed at my pictures, and commented on Cammy growing up. After spending time with her I met up with Sean and Cam at the park and ""played"" some horse. After went to Rachel's house and had pizza with Darlena showing up 10 minutes later. Lauren, Nikki, Erinn, Jill came by for a few minutes. Had some nice Britney brownie time. =] Then dropped off Sean at Cam's to sleep, while Cammy and I had another midnight snack.<br /><br />Tuesday-NOTHING BUT TV AND LOUNGING!! :-D I should be doing my homework..but no thanks ;-D<br /><br /><br />Only 3 school day and then we have the weekend. Woo Hoo!</p>"

"event","Senior year has been amazing in every aspect. Its not the perfect year i wanted, but its so much better! I'm truly truly happy. The first day chilling in my uniform kind of sucked lol, but it was funny. Trying to do journalism was interesting, but some things just don't work out. When some doors close others open; and the STU CO door re-opened for me. 
  Student Council has been nice. I remember more than I thought I would. I'm not bitter or have any hard feelings toward anyone. I really love these kids. Mrs. Stewart is fine, a few duh moments with her but hey everyone has them. Most of the  class has accepted me back, but I really don't fit with the other seniors except with Johnn. I usually just talk with the juniors and sophomores, or work quietly. 
  Working on HC made me see the true colors of some people. Some of the things i hoped wouldn't happen, and some people completely surprised me. Kayla and Kellie have stepped up so much. The Sophomore class is full of over-achievers. Most of the seniors are completely lazy and ignorant. Dance turned out beautifully, and i must say Ashley and I made a kickass balloon arch for the front! 
  The luncheon at GVR Buffet, had such a fun atmosphere, but was eventually turned uncomfortably due to some uninvited guests. Driving the dance-est bunch of sophomores, almost made me pee my pants. Mel gets too excited over chocolate covered strawberries and runs into walls. And I have the same group of people in my car for trick-or-treat a thon, dear lord I think I might have to wear a diaper.
  HC was very well planned, and over all it was a good night, aside from a few hiccups here and there.
  Colorguard has truly taken a part of my heart. I intend to try it at UNLV, but who knows what will happen next year. Competitions have been going fine, only two more. Then back to being a boring old dance class. All the rediculous that happen on the bus rides to and from competitions, competitions themselves, and award accepting is hysterical:
-""do, do, dododo..ma- na-mana!"" Tara and Manny
-""Police chase! Get him, get him!"" Jillian
-""is this a small enough bag for you?"" Jennifer
-""Does he even know where our school is?"" Krissy
-Soft hair Dante
-ridiculious salute dances
-""You look like a fish"" Janice
-Zach and his soft arms
-Preston and his amazing drawings
-Cold California
-Sticking out of the windows to say by to our band
-Saying bye to other bands bus to bus style
-Silly stamping people
-Green necks
-Lumpia stealers
-Joking with Cody anytime during run thru-s and competitions
-Tyler the lil freshman
-Getting knocked out by krissy
-Knocking Krissy out
  After out last morning practice, I will be sad. Getting up isn't that great, but joking with some of the band makes up for it. I highly doubt i will talk to most of them after the last competition. They really have become sort of like family. I won't get to make faces at Cody anymore.. :(
  Sidelines are just so..odd and unpredictable. The band just picks something the play and can start to pick up the pace and we have to dance the the given tempo. Senior night game was just so boring and hysterical. I made fun of Jillian so much, (her dead horse ""hay""). This Friday might be our last game to do sidelines, hopefully our operation sadie asking goes well.
  After the game on Thursday Sarah, Darlena, and I went and had some mazing pizza. Afterwards we chilled with Sean and Cammy. Watching a movie doesn't work went we just keep talking up a storm for lost time. but the men in 300=hotties, even if all of them are fake except one. Friday I watched around 4 or 5 hours of Discovery Channel, haha. I met up with Darlena and got our overpriced winter show costumes. Then later had Coldstone and Postsecret fest with Sarah. Ending the night with a little time spent in the astrology section at Barnes and Nobles. Saturday started at Red Robin team lunch. I took an azn full car to the bank with a nice helium moment and major ghetto music fest. Met up again with the team at Michaels to buy jewels and then had a lil scooter/blanket party/wall ball party until McGrath opened to dance room for us. After Boulder City Competition, I went to Frankie's. I saw some very unexpected people there, like Jason Hill, Tiny and Charlie. The house was crazy, but I was just so tired and chill. I finally left, and almost died from sleepy-ness driving.
  This year hopefully will stick to this kind of path, I'm liking it.

Oh and boys shouldn't kiss you unless some real legit flirting happened between the two. fhatohi8ewaktihra;og..."

"event","This is has been an interesting one. So many lost connections and some made even stronger. Though we keep reminding ourselves that we'll get around the that ultimate chick night with everyone, we still know that the possibility of it is getting slimmer and slimmer. I decided to write to some of you a type of yearbook little note, with oh yes, your names, so we don't have to play the guessing game. We are growing up and this beating around the bush takes too much energy that I need to use... to sleep. :-D I hope everyone's summers exceed their expectations and become the one they think about first about high school summer time. 

Sarah- You have been an inspiration. You fought for a small dream, that has made many realize that lil Misch has got talent! I wish you so much luck with choir and theatre next year. Without you here at Silverado has I think been a blessing in disguise. We've all come to appreciate you even more and understood you better without having to reanalyze you everyday. I hope to see you this summer. Let's do lunch! Love you Snow White!

Tara- Even if sometimes you think i don't like you, i respect you 100%. You know you have talents and you don't boast or lose them. All your hard work i know will pay off in the end. From freshman year where we started off kind of weird, to now where i know if i need to just say something to someone i could call you, because you listen. I may not call you or hang out with you, but i know your always there. Your big heart will help you make make it to Broadway! Save me a seat in any show your going to do this summer!

Rachel- You've always got a genuine smile on your face. This past year you and I both know we have grown a part, but growing needs room. You've shown me that alone time, isn't bad time. Crazy music and some peel masks is all that's needed for a necessary bond. I know your busy with your family and boyfriend, but don't completely cut out friends. Hopefully i can kidnap you sometime this summer!

Lauren- We've never been really close, but this year I believe we got a little bit closer. You have really become a great person. From simply hanging out on the balcony to swimming with crazy kids at the pool, your down to earth and easy going, which makes hanging out with you so easy. Sometimes i wished though, you would be more free spirited. So lets let loose and run thru sprinklers this summer. I want to see more of your pretty face, girly!

Darlena- Oh god girl... this year was crazy. Complete organized chaos! I don't even know where to start. Let me just admit that this year was the Lisa and Darlena show, dear god. I seriously cannot think of a week we went without seeing eachother... You've made my junior year not suck most of the time, even with Mr. Vlasak trying so hard. :-D From Tommy to TLI to Sadies to Snow to Dance Shows to Frozen to PH to PHYSICS!! to Frankie's to the Law Firm to Sheridans to DRAMA to Drill auditions to Fugitive to everything in between. I probably could go on for so long. From our ""deep sheridan conversations"" getting ruined by my car dying to our crazy dancing moments, you've truly left a HUGE country like spot in my life. I doubt i will ever have another Darlena in my life, and even if i did, you set that bar so high no one could even touch it. GIRL! We got one more year to make an impact, and i know were going to make new hilarious impacts on people's lives...ahem DRILL! If you moved away right now i would myspace you forever until i could find you, scouts honor. 

Sean- From our stupid sister soccer games to almost being seniors, we've had a pretty whacky friendship. Since our soccer game days, you've really become an unbelievable gentlemen, with a hilarious side. I better just admit that you are my favorite out of your family, but your mom and sister are close behind. Our hang outs have been very spontaneous, but I think it works. :-D I hope this summer we have more spontaneous hang outs.

Cam- Cam, Cam, Cam... what do i say to a crazy fool, who will always feel I don't write ""deep"" enough. :-D From just being little siblings, i think you turned out way better, between you and shannon that is. :-D Your crazy growth spurt sometimes makes me wonder what veggies you ate... You finally given theatre another try with an open mind, while trying to bring back traditions of our siblings, haha. I hope to do a show with you next year, and even if i don't I'll be in the audience with the bike horn..

Nikki- This year we weren't too close, but you still had my back. Everytime we talk, it seems we pick up where we left off, never making things seem weird. I hope you make the hairspray international show! You've got talents that you need to let shine! Work that new hair and get what you know ""you CAN have!""

Cassie- you graduating whore. For only knowing you one year, i can honestly say, that you have shown me that we had another boss bitch in the theatre. and i loved it! You amazing red head, i am really waiting for you to become a famous director, or maybe even a dirty rap video director. I know you got the skills so put them to good use! I will miss you.

Alex Tice- Um, I love you? You've shown me some good times i must admit. haha, you truly show me balls to the walls kind of action sometimes, and it kills me. Though your not going too far, your still not close enough were i can find you sitting in your car listening to Mark and Mercedes in the parking lot, first period. You got the talent for many things, just choose and tackle the challenges head first. Let's bang this summer. haha

Luke effin Horvath- What do i say to my first real gay. Two homecomings, lots of stupid jokes, dancing, touching, and all the car rides enough for oprah to spend months talking about. You have pretty much molded part of me in every aspect of my life. This year I didn't see much of you, but that doesn't mean that we didn't have our moments. I hope you will stay in touch, even if one text a month. Get out there and conquer NYU you sexy beast! Jamba Jamba Jamba!

You've all truly influenced my life, and I hope i made a slight impact on yours too."

"event","i was out-campaigned, i know it and i truely dont mind. I thought devin's and caleb's stuff was really clever. I just wish i had more time and a little more confidence in this one, but i don't, how could i after the first day of campaigning? If i win i will be completely shocked, i might just laugh for a few minutes. But if i lose i lose, i wont cry, i wont talk shit (hopefully :-D). Winning fair and square is the only way i would want to win and I campaigned that way so im proud of myself. This was the dirtiest campaign i have ever been involved with, i can't believe it got to me so much too, i guess i forgot about how much i love council. If i don't win though, i really don't know if i'll go back, as bad as that sounds, but why be a part of something that I'm not completely happy with? We'll see tomorrow... i think i might just hurl, im so nervous.

Safekey is one of the most tiring jobs i've ever done or heard of. Entertaining 80+ kids everyday for 3-4 hours is crazy for 5 straight days. I love most of the kids, especially 
Ani and her sister Jewel, their like my little sisters :-D they even kinda look like me. Then there's this little girl emily who cocks her head to the side every time she talks its cute. But they're all soo emotional! Geez! Everyday there is atleast 3 kids who cry.

My STEP professor asked me today if a was a cruel kid...and i couldnt help but be sarcastic and say back ""yes, im the biggest rude, cruel person you will ever meet, watch out!"" haha. I don't think she understand our class yet, because we pick on eachother all the time. But then for the rest of class if anyone said anything kind of snippy we would all start yelling "" how could you be so cruel!?"" She gave us an annoyed look but w/e we have eachothers backs.

I'm not mad that i got an excellent, im mad cuz people who didnt deserve them got them too. How am i suppose to be happy if im on the same level of people who truely didnt deserve an excellent.

checking it adding things, but not feeling anything.
trips are suppose to make you excited for adventures...
i bet by the time i get there, itll be fine.
but i just cant get in the spirit, for once.

things havent really been going my way but never in the ""turn for the worst"" just not what i want.

once more quarter....fuck...hurry up.

when my rooms a mess im a mess.

my counselor should go choke on a cookie. shes so dumb she doesnt understand anything that comes out of my mouth and she wastes so much time..

my grades for 3rd quarter arent what i need.

hopefully this conference is just what i need to get me back on track.

gossip is what runs silverado theatre.

14 days until my birthday...aka 2 weeks."

"event","state was amazing... though i dont think i could do theatre for a living.

i had a lot of fun but there was a few of downfalls but hey no worries.

where did we pick up those kids? haha

i got excellent on my monos which was pretty much a funny shock, cuz they werent too excellent.

the guy i met at regionals i hung out with during the WHOLE conference pretty much. i love jeff and his spoiled-ness. he was my dancing bitch.

ON was pretty great but some things were a little odd. i still love tony doing clint homes...LMAO.

the workshops were actually pretty awesum, except the only one one i got dragged to by jeff. named something like ""getting your face on TV""...should have been called ""one hour of some lame guy""

unarmed combat was fun to watch :)

all the dancing! holy crap! couldnt have more dancing i dont think damn.

i did a random kind of yoga dance workshop which was really calming. <3

my state shirt was pretty whore of me, thank god that guna sit in the back of my closet now.

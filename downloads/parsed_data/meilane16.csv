Until then, I've got to struggle through school in mediocrity, with poor spelling and bland style.

"event","the saga of prague:

after agreeing to meet at the train station at 8am, only emily and jan arrive on time.  i'm ten minutes late, but in the mean time emily's realized she forgot her passport and caught a taxi home and back again.  we're all still waiting on angela, who incidentally lives in the same building with jan; he just didn't think to knock on her door.  we've planned to buy a bayern ticket: 25 euros for up to five people anywhere within bavaria.  as i'm busy figuring out how to use the ticket machine, jan wanders off and back again with a direct ticket to cheb (just within the czech border) for ten euros.  and his train leaves in two minutes.  emily and i let him go and decide to give angela until the next train to cheb.  we manage to miss that train all on our own, running out onto the platform just in time to see it leave.  we wait another hour, all the while frantically calling angela (she had 41 missed calls in the end).  on a side note, emily and angela were planning on sharing luggage, so emily brought all her things in a plastic bag.  then, finally, on the 10:30 train emily and i leave for cheb.

at this point, we won't be able to make it into prague before 3, which is the cut-off time for the student housing/hostel where we were planning to stay.  we meet three german girls and split a ticket from cheb to prague.  they invite us to check out their hostel, which supposedly had openings the day before.  we get there eventually after two trains and a bus and lots of complicated explanations in czech/german from train conductors.  the hostel is booked up.  everything is booked up, because it's a holiday in germany and everyone's travelling.  at the train station, emily picked up a flyer from a woman offering accomodation, so as we make our way to the hostel with only the tiny map on the flyer we come across the same woman walking home.  emily's still carrying this grocery bag of clothing and we're both exhausted, hungry, and practically homeless.  she no longer has any vacancies, but offers to call a friend who also owns a pension of some sort.  as we follow her inside a building (presumably an office) we realize it's acutally her apartment.  her husband's cooking in the kitchen and we're offered coffee and bread.  her friend's out shopping, so we've got a half hour to wait for a response.  in the mean time, the husband gets into lively conversation with us in german.  at one point, he begins with ""i have something to show you.  i don't know if you have such things in america""    emily and i exchange a look ""but i have a radio museum in my bedroom.""  he shows us into his room, where the walls are literally lined with radios of all shapes sizes and ages.  he boasts  about them for a while, before turning to another wall, covered with shelves of those electronic toys that sing and move.  they're all indecent.  he turns on a witch on a toilet, which he calls his wife and then two old people in a bath...  emily and i are so tired and stressed that we can't stop laughing.  it is just so bizarre to be in this tiny post-soviet apartment, with two crazy czechs and a radio museum.  we finally hear back from the friend, who somehow has space (probably because she lives so far out) and all drink a shot of chocolate liquor together before parting ways.  

the hostel/pension where we stayed is kind of like a crazy old aunt's house.  it smells funny and the bathroom is dirty in an old-age kind of way.  but the beds are comfortable and we don't plan on spending too much time there anyway.  the woman who owns it is wonderful, she explains the bus and train systems to us probably four or five times, and takes us through all the steps of getting home and into town.  she warns us against ""schlechte leute"" and narrow streets in the old town at night.  

prague itself is breathtakingly beautiful.  i love it.  we saw the sites, an art museum, and a great sit-on-the-floor hippie tea room.  we ate breakfast at bohemia bagel everyday and met up with some of emily's friends studying there.

it was an experience i'm glad i had.

It's funny how awkward everything feels at the start, like trying to fit a round peg into the square hole (as mom would say).  And then, slowly, without my notice, everything starts to fall into place until it doesn't feel like a different world any more, it feels right.  Bayreuth is amazing.  The town is quaint, historical and jaunty, while the university is in constant motion, full of students drinking beer on the patio or eating an ice cream.  

I've seen Nuernberg and Berlin, so far, but I'm trying to plan ahead and see as much as possible before the craziness of the world cup descends on Germany.  I bought a bike!  I went with a group of other internationals to a village about 9km away to find my used treasure.  She was about 50 euros but she's dreamy with a rack behind and a light that works on the power of the back wheel.  We had to ride our bikes back from the village, which was also quite an adventure.  The landscape was so rolling and German/Austrian that I had to hum and whistle the Sound of Music ""Doe a Deer"" song all the way home, while we rode our bikes in two's. 

I miss home sometimes, but it's better now that I've got more to do.  I have a Referat (presentation) a week from today for my German Expression (Ausdrucksfaehigkeit) class.  It's a comparision between my home university (W&L) and Uni Bayreuth.  It should be interesting; I intend on bringing in photos of campus (collonade and srat row?).

Guess that's all, I have a film history class that starts in half an hour or so (6pm here) but all we do is watch movies, so it should be a nice evening.

"event","I fear I've become That Girl Who Updates Too Frequently and monopolizes her friends' ""friends"" pages.  But I'm off to Ann Arbor tonight and Chicago the next day (so you can all look forward to a quick Debby-break)!  I'm excited about visiting Kirsten and seeing Chrissy for the first time in as many years.  I have a day today to pack and get myself together, listen to Detroit-area radio stations and spend some quality time with The Dog.
What else to say?  I got my W&L grades last night, which were a pleasant surprise after an intensely stressful last few days.  I miss Lex around Christmastime, however; Troy is considerably less charming.  
I'm listening to a radio station that claims to ""play everything.""  What kind of advertisement is that?  I want something with a little discretionary discrimination when it comes to music-- otherwise, what's the point in listening to any particular radio station?  It's like saying, I don't have a favorite type of music, I like everything... Who likes everything?  No one.  
My friend Addy once asked a boy what his favorite season was and he said he didn't have one.  He liked silly things like ""the crunch of leaves in the fall"" the ""feel of the summer sun"" and blah blah blah.  A person cannot possibly like all the seasons or all the music in the world.  It's noncommital and annoying.
Anyway... I hope everyone has a very Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!

in other news, it's the first evening free i've had in forever and i really meant to go to the knitting club meeting and be social and get a free t-shirt... but then, thanks to the over-enthusiastic air conditioning in my apartment, i found myself wearing pajamas at 8 and listening to rufus wainwright while cleaning my room.  yes, oh yes and writing a live journal entry for what i'm sure is an avid and captivated audience.  maybe next time i'll wait until something exciting happens.

and today at work, the post-communist russian department is still doing its best to speed deforestation.  the scattered older russian professor decided that since the school would not order a huge chechnian novel she needs, she would use the german and russian deparment's printer to yes, indeed, PRINT the entire novel.  i stayed until the end of part one. which was 490 pages.   
and then, to top off a lovely day, i got back from university printer's (where i was explaining to them the idiocy of the russian department and how i was asked, rather meanly, to have the chechnian novel bound) only to be greeted by an anxious german department concerned that their potential new hire/ guest speaker would be parched when delivering his lecture. ahh.. so yes i was sent back out into the heat to purchase him some cold water (the importance of its temperature was emphasized several times to me).  best of all, i had to buy it with the last, sad remains of my my food debit account.  they didn't even offer to buy.  so that was my day.

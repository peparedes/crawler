Having many serious thoughts about doing painfull things to my mum. She is probably the main reason i'm depressed. I'm hoping my dad will see how bad it is and let me go live with him. I hope... But the many times i've called him he always says no. Thats starting to piss me off something shocking. Mum won't even give me my pay which means i can't go see a movie. All this ontop of me having the flu. Life is not looking good. Luckily i'm too scared to kill myself, i suppose thats good...."

"event","OMFG!!!!! Mandy Patinkin was FUCKING AWESOME!!!!! went to his concert last night and LOVED it. He sung so many awesome songs, i was hanging to hear ""multitudes of amy"" but he didnt. But i still loved the night. He sang sondheim, rodgers and hammerstein, les miserables, and after his encore we thought he'd go, but he ran out on stage to finish the night with ""hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!!!"". (yes, he was in princess bride, and a plethora of other movies including that bodgy streisand jewish movie, even though he didnt sing GRR!!) Man he is so HOT!!! and i got such a suprise as i was looking around because i noticed i was sitting next to his son gideon! it was such a suprise and i felt all special to know we got awesome seats!

What else has been happening, erm money is really tight at the moment because of stupid centerlink cutting off my payments. But hey, such is life. And i've decided to quit smoking after working out that each year i spend $1540 a year! My god, i mean, that could be a second hand car! but nope, all my money is (excuse the pun) going up in smoke. But yes, i'm getting alot of support from friends and family =^.^= This week i'm getting $30 which isn't bad considering i've just recently spent like, $200 on various tickets (see last entry).

Erm, i dont think much else is happening, hoping to meet up with all my friends next week, i've been a bit of a recluse recently. Havn't been calling anyone etc. Stoopid phobia of phones. I hate calling people so much, but i have to do it, so i will. 

I'd best go now and get some food. It's 1300 and i havn't eaten anything all day. It's really starting to freak me out that i'm not eating lately.

But as for Euro trip. That was a damn funny movie. And it had michelle trachtenberg. That was an awesome find. very funny. I suggest it for anyone who likes a good laugh. And ofcourse it has the classic ""Happy ending"". Now i'm sitting down to watch Pirates of the Caribbean. Have to see it before the second comes out. I think That the second will be a good watch.

"event","I've known Mello for as long as I can remember. We went to the same boarding school, both being trained as the great L's successor. And know here we are. I gained the right to be the knew L, and he became a criminal. I suppose I should have seen it coming, but I didn't. I always knew he was an evil prick, but my longing for him has always clouded my judgment of him. But my longing has to wait no more. We are alone. Both finally working together to catch Kira. Or atleast, that's what I thought when he told me that ""we should be together"". I was shocked when he told me he loved me. How could anyone love me? Especially someone as beautiful as Mello. But it doesn't matter. Now i have him and I'm not letting go. He puts his arms around me and holds me. Nothing more, just the most sensual hug I've ever had. Although, it's the only sexual experience I've ever had, it's been my dream for so long. His deep warming stare reaches to the bottom of my soul. As his warm breath tingles my lips, the sticky tendrils of love were creeping up the nape of my neck. I feel myself swelling in my pants, and Mello must have noticed too, for his hand ran down my back and pulled me closer to him. He broke our kiss and removed his shirt. I took this as a hint to do the same and clumsily removed my top. His muscles glint in the warm light radiating from the roof. My pants were slightly easier to remove, as he was wearing three belts, but in no time at all we were both standing. Naked as the day we were born and admiring each others body for the first time. I felt so proud to know his rigid cock was standing at attention just for me. Quietly I asked ""Seme?"" His mischevious grin spread across his face. ""Oh no, I'm the most Uke person you'll ever know!"" With that he grabbed on of his belts and spun me around. He bound my hands and then crouched to start on my legs. I was scared, but at the same time strangely turned on. He lifted me in his strong arms and leant me against a column nearby. He knealt and wrapped his hand around me. He teased the me with his tongue before taking my entire cock in his mouth. This was too much for my virgin body to bare. I came deep into his...

There was a sound. Near speedily shut his laptop and stood up, attempting to flatten the bulge in his trousers. He unplugged the laptop and put it away in its bag, wishing he could do the same with his love for mello. He turned around and walked through the dimly lit quiet halls, outside into his car. He sped home thinking of mello. ""Aahhh, virginity is a 'hands on' job""."

I've written up a day list, for every hour. Means i can cross it off if i havn't smoked. Kind of a way of showing myself i'm doing well. Splitting the hard task into many easy tasks. I'm actually looking forward to being a non-smoker. It means i can go out in public without depending on something else to make me happy. But, you know the thing i'm most looking forward to most?? I'm going to be able to actually have money!!! I can't wait. I'm not saying it's gonna be easy. It's gonna be bloody hard. But i know, that if i keep at it (and get a little help from my friends!) I can do anything. 
Sorry about the whole Sob story. But i am very much needing to vent all my problems. I'm hoping to meet up with DK soon. (i would have made it a link thing, but i forgot most of my HTML stuff.)

Now, i'm sure most of you have been through your 'phase' of puberty but i'm 16 and it's just hit. All these girls are hanging out with me (which is wierd cause i'm fat and they aren't...) and they are all flirty and one or two say stuff that seems really pravocative, but then for some reason i make a fool of myself by asking them out, and again and again and again (like in midori days)but no, they dont want me. And now, TWICE my 'best friend' after i tell him i have a crush on someone, coincidentally, those two start going out very soon after.... pisses me off sooo much. i mean, i really hate the son of a bitch now, but how could anyone abuse my trust like that??? i feel so hurt.. i hate it

Which is annoying because i havn't told her that i prefer guys, so now i'm missing out on fun because she thinks i wanna screw my friends.

Hmm, finally learnt EVERY SINGLE WORD OF LES MISERABLES!!! even without the music i can sing the entire score of le miserables. I'm so praoud, it's taken me three months. Now i think i'll move onto learning smoething like west side story, i'm already half way there. 

XBOX 360!!! nearly out. but noo, koshi doesn't have a job, BAH! stoopid lack of money. ofcourse blackburn high doesn't have a year 11 camp, they only have a big holiday to alice springs. $1300!!! i can't afford that. It's so annoying, so i need a job for heaps of stuff.

I tried weed the other day. I've been smoking for a few months so you knoew though i just might experiment.
I kinda liked it at first, feels really light headed. That was from a joint, but then i had a bong. Bong are like a kick in the head. Joints get you high, bongs get you stoned. Made me feel really lazy, and my body seemed to weigh a few extra hundred kilos. But, i wont be trying weed again for a loooong while. not my cup of tea. I've also quit smoking now. the only thing left to stop is caffiene.

Saw the first episode of the count of monti cristo anime. something like gangourou or something. Very interesting animation. I kinda liked it, but the next anime i rent will be the ghibli collection. 13 movies in one box i think...

It's based on the manga of the same name, about a weatherwoman who flashes her panties during her report. It then turns into this really dodgy and funny movie about the old weatherwoman wanting her job back. It's great.

Anyways, nothing else really new, so poo."

"event","I have now seen Underworld Evolution. It was so much better than the first. What was strange though, is how they did the sex scene. I mean, it was really candid, yet nothing was shown. It's kinda hard to explain, they didn't even do the usual hairy man-ass bobbing up and down. it was just, wierd. But much better fights and what with the Vamp/Lichen cross this movie easily gets 4/5 stars from me.

Anyways, I havn't been hearing from my little journal buddies. Where are you all? I know a few of you are on holiday, and a few are just too lazy to write something, but the rest of you can't have fallen off the edge of the earth. Aah well.

"event","Well, it would seem that my idea of putting on recipies didn't quite work out how I planned. Not only did i get lazy, but I've been fighting with my mum and she wouldn't let me on the pc. Anyways, anyone cosplaying at manifest 06? I was thinking about going as Dark Chi from Chobits, but seeing a fat 16 year old guy in a corset kinda wouldn't be good right? lol. So now I'm thinking of either fat people, like the turnip spirit from Spirited Away, or a costume that i could atleast attempt to pull off. Maybe i could go as Biggs from any of the Final Fantasy games. I like the costume in 8 the most. Aah well, to lazy to write more."

"event","That's right! Now that I'm over the siiiick part of glandular fever, although I have pretty much no energy, I have been able to cook again! And that got me to thinking how awesome it would be to write up a list of the recipes that have gotten me through so many troubles in my life. Today I am starting my list of Chinese recipes, and when I think of quick chinese food I think first to Wonton soup. 

(Oh no! Iron chef moment come over me!!) If my memory serves me correctly, Wonton actually means ""Floating clouds"" (I learnt this from Elizibeth Chong, please correct me if I'm wrong..). Although you can buy them pre-made, it is always better if you make your own little wontons. So here is the simplest way to make them. Read the recipe all the way through before starting, and when joining wonton wrapper together, it will stick better with a little egg yolk brushed on.(Now I leave out things like pinch of salt and pepper from ingredient list unless it's something wierd like white pepper, because I trust you have salt...)

You shall need:
60g of Raw Prawns
125g of Minced pork
2 chopped shallots
1tbs of Soy sauce
1 clove of crushed garlic
grated root ginger for taste
125g of Wonton wrappers (available from most chinese grocers)
1 litre of Chicken stock
Sesame oil to taste
3tbs of FINELY chopped coriander

Shell and de-vein prawns and chop finely. Mix together prawns, pork, shallots, salt, soy sauce, garlic and ginger. Place a small amount of this filling on each sqaure of wonton dough and fold over diagonally. then fold one corner across and stick to the first fold. Do the same with the other corner. The three ends of the triangle should be distinctly regocnizable as wontons. Drop these into boiling stock and boil for 7 minutes. Turn off heat, add sesame oil, sprinkle with shallots and coriander and serve instantly.



Well, there you have it, my favorite wonton recipe. All thanks go to Charmaine Solomon, and I would love to hear any comments you have if you actually try this recipe out.

Next update will be maybe tomorrow, I think maybe every second update will be a recipe ok?

ADIOSO!"

"event","Welcome 2006! Personally, 2005 was a rough year for me, missing Manifest, Getting Depression, being diagnosed with glandular fever. You know, pretty hard, but hey! 2006 is here! 
Now; New info....

Erm, I have a Gamecube now! That just means all I need is a cheap PS2 to complete my #1 consoles of Next Generation gaming (if you think hard I'm sure what i just said makes sense). I have my XBox, Gamecube and DS. Personally I don't consider the PSP to be worth getting, but as soon as they bring out a battery pack I'm sure I'll get it, well, as soon as I have money me having no job and all.....
Which reminds me, I NEED A JOB!!! Why did they make it so hard to get a job? I mean, sure I have some faults, but I'm a really hard worker. But no, people just keep rejecting me. Aah well, as soon as I start up my japanese lessons I'm pretty sure that ontop of my year 11 schooling means that Centerlink will pay me extra because of my Bipolar (that means I'm crazy).

Erm, So many stoopid people in my life right now that I decided to piss one of them off by writing a funny story about her. See, she and I always have this little incest joke going on because people keep saying that her brothers are hot (I havn't met them yet). So I tease her about it, and just to annoy her I published an Incest story about her online. Now it's my first story so it's kinda short but you know, blah blah. I have totally forgotten my html so here is the link: http://www.asstr.org/~Kristen/39/lisa.txt  OK oh by the way IT'S XXX SO DON'T READ UNLESS YOU LIKE THAT FILTH!!! And soon I'll write a story about just her brothers ok? so ladies dont worry, a story for you will be here soon.

Okies, dont think there is anything else, erm, oh yeah, you all have my msn addy right? shinji_2000@hotmail.com     And i hope you've been going to anime plus in box hill?????? excellent rentals and the guy there is so funny and chibi! although thanks to my brother and his renting of kiddy grade i kinda have a $40 overdue...


Anyways, ADIOSO!"

Now, worry not peoples for I am getting better, but it means that I have to lie down and rest horizontally. Thankfully my mum has moved the xbox and spare tv into my room so I'm not ocmpletely bored, and she has let me have these few minutes to get you all feeling sad for me :(

Anyways, I did see my dad today. He was giving out chrissy presents so I got an mp3 player and my brother who's birthday is in january got both presents combined and recieved a portable DVD player. I really don't see the point to it but I suppose it might be useful on long car trips?

I just can't seem to think of anything else to write. except that my dad will put some pics of me online soon. Anyways, I suppose I should go and sleep now.

IIIN other news, i am unfortuantely unable to post pictures cause i need a stoopid paid account, BUT i will just make some shitty little cjb.net or something site where i can put up pics. For now if your really desperate to see me you could just ask me to email you a really old photo of me back in the days of my thin-ness (aaah, i was so young). I look very much the same, just fat now. 

OOH! i'm watching kiddy grade right now. and by right now i mean RIGHT NOW. it's really cool, its got so much peadophillik (sorry, crappy speller i is) stuff, except they are like, 400 years old really.... But yeah, it's an awesome anime. 

And DK, well i found you because i was scouring the net for pics from manifest 2005 and found your hot pics =^.^=

And i thought of this awesome joke. This is thanks to king kong being out and all, but think about coolies Donkey Kong in a vietnam war movie. They would be fighting the Viet Kong and the vietnamese would shout 'diddy mau!' (no offence meant if i spelt that wrong sorry *blush*). I hope that doesn't come over as rascist, cause you know, i just thought it was kinda funny....

Aaanyways, i should leave now. I shall make a crappy site soon full of pics. Adioso!"

The time is finally here, my year 10 exams are ovah! Man it is teh major coolness, unfortunatly i have been left horribly tired and with one helluver hangover. But alas, i suppose it cant be helped. And this friday, not only is it the new harry potter movie out, but also the day of my formal!! i'm so excited. I'll take heapsof photos and scan them at school, just for the select few of you who happen to chance upon my blog. If anyone else is gonna see the potter movie on thursday at ringwood, then perhaps you would like to join this complete internet stranger for some lunch afterwards? Dont worry, i dont bite (hard..). 
Anyways, and i can't stress this enough peoples, It is not asseptable to pay the redheaded busker who busks outside Fasta Pasta in ringwood. Sure he is the father of my nephew, but all his busking money is going straight into his arm, and I know this cause he has made me, a poor defencless 16 year old go and buy his shit for him. So i implore you not only to avoid paying him, but give him a boot to the head if you ever see him. His name is Dean Bowman and he deserves nothing less that your complete hatred.

Bah, i must leave thee, my droogian brothers so i can viddi a movie. Oh god, the pain in my gulliver just shall not rest. So hopefully it chall leave me be during a ultraviolets (incase yoyu dont know, i have just been watching Clockwork Orange)

"event","Wow, this is quite amazing! i ave reached the 4th issue, i never thought i would remember to update this but there is so much happening in my world these days, that its so hard not to!

For starters, i saw midori days! its the stoopidest anime, but in a good way =^.^=  The story is about this tough guy who is sad because he thinks the only sex he will ever get is with his right hand, then his hand turns into a girl! Its like a little hand puppet, its so funny, and has LOTSA fan service, unfortunatly its shoji, so all the fanservice is for guys, but you know, its still an awesome anime (hey, do you call anime shoji and shojo? or is that just with manga??)

oh hey, i havnt told you about myself yet really have i? well, I'm a 16 year old bisexual schoolboy, currently attending Blackburn High School.My name is Robin Moir (but i am known as Koshi) and I live in nunawading, just down the road from McDonalds and KFC (KFC is partly why i'm such a porker (>"")> =^.^= ) and loove anime, musicals, hard rock ( i know, my music taste is a little wierd =^.^=) horror movies are always good, and i collect hentai and yaoi, a good manga doesnt go astray (currently trying to find the hunterXhunter and kindaichi case files but i think i said that already) I am veeery lonely mainly on account of my weight, but there are still times when i find a bag big enough to put over my head and go out in public to buy uht milk and freeze dried raman =^.^= no, i'm not THAT bad, but i do love raman (if i spelt that correctly..). So yeah, thats me, just and average guy with the ability to BAMF around the place.... (did i meantion i read x-men??) 

Anyways, its awesome to see that the reason i started a journal has replied to my stalkerness! I'm talking about druscilloskayne.... OOh and help me out here, i have a year 10 formal coming up, and my mom thinks its innapropriate to wear a dress. I i'm a really fat guy so i think i could pull off chi from chobits pretty well right?? but nah seriously, i think it would be funny to wear a dress right?? if you could leave a yay or nay that would be awesome!!

DANKE UND ADIOSO!

I love the idea of midori days! have any of you seen it? i would love to have your ideas on it. Then there is Naruto, wich i havnt seen yet and everyone says i should. but there are sooo many episode lol, i cant believe it. But i suppose it seems cool, and i did like inuyasha and slayers, so the whole ninja-thing is cool...

Ooh, though i hate initialD, can anyone explain that to me? i mean, the story is ok, but i hate the cartoon AND cg mixture, it just annoys me. And i thought i would like it because i love need for speed underground??

Ooh, i hope youve all been to Anime Plus in Box Hill, they still have awesome anime, and unfortunatly i havnt been for a few weeks :( but that should change soon. I love the guy in there, he doesnt speak much english, but he is really nice and has some great wallscrolls for only $10!!!

"event","Yepskies, i'm listening to Eric Idle singing 'I like chinese'. I'll put the lyrics here but dont read it if you get offended easily. Just remember that it is all funny and he isnt serious about what he's saying. Anyways, if anyone is more anti-rascist than my, then i would wanna meet you because i have gotten in so many punchups because of people being rascist. Anyways, here are the lyrics to 'I like chinese'
Singer (spoken):The world today seems absolutely cracked. With nuclear bombs to blow us all sky high. There's fools and 
idiots sitting on the trigger. It's depressing, and it's senseless, and that's why...

Singer (singing):
I like chinese,
I like chinese,
They only come up to your knees,
Yet they're always friendly and they're ready to to please.

I like chinese,
I like chinese,
There's nine hundred million of them in the world today,
You'd better learn to like them, that's what I say.

I like chinese,
I like chinese,
They come from a long way overseas,
But they're cute, and they're cuddly, and they're ready to please.

I like chinese food,
The waiters never are rude,
Think of the many things they've done to impress,
There's maoism, taoism, eging and chess.

So, I like chinese,
I like chinese,
I like their tiny little trees,
Their zen, their ping-pong, their ying and yang-eze.

I like chinese thought,
The wisdom that Confucius taught,
If Darwin is anything to shout about,
The chinese will survive us all without any doubt.

So, I like chinese,
I like chinese,
They only come up to your knees,
Yet they're wise, and they're witty, and they're ready to please.

Singer: All together!

Chinese Choir:
Wo, I chumba run,
Wo, I chumba run,
Wo, I chumba run,
Ne hamma, Ne hamma, Ne hamma chi chen.

I like chinese,
I like chinese,
Their food is guaranteed to please,
A fourteen, a seven, a nine and li-chese

I like chinese, 
I like chinese, 
I like their tiny little trees,
Their zen, their ping-pong, their ying and yang-eze

anyways, welcome, i'm koshi and i'm a geek. i go to blackburn high school, try desperatly to collect anime, i'm kinda angry today because i have just been reading up on how 1337 manifest '05 was. i cant believe i missed it. my mum took me on holiday so i wasnt able to go to it. GRR i hate her... nah, i actually love her and shes an awesome mum, but she just doesnt understand things sometimes =^.^=                                                                                                       anyways, the main reason i made this is so that i can talk to all the 1337 manifest people on here. it really suprises me how close the anime society of melbourne is. its really cool, so i have to try ahrd to squeese miself into there. But i'm not going too badly considering i went to my first manifest in 2003 and all i knew about was evangelion. now its 05 and i OWN the entire evangelion, chobits, hellsing, ghost in the shell 1 and 2 and stand alone complex, then there are all the ones i have rented like full metal alchemist and stuff.                                                                                      Ooh by the way, everyone who reads this blog and lives in melbourne should go to box hill central and find a little shop called anime zone. I rented the ENTIRE series of full metal alchemist for 10 bux. how awesome is that? you pay $3.50 per dvd and each dvd has around 30 episodes on it. its freakin awesome. i bought hellsing for 20 bux. i love it. but yeah, there is a nice little anime gauntlet in box hill, you start near darkzone, at a little shop called hobby japan. this is my favorite shop for buying things on sale. then you walk up the road to animezone. this is the best shop for comics because you can not only buy all the awesome hentai comnics for 5 bux, but you can buy fanmade comics wich are awesome. then you walk up to anime plus where you rent an anime series, and since that shop is near the station you walk inside to get bubblecup (the greatest drink ever) and some pocky (you dont know what pocky is???? they are the greatest snack in the world.!) then i catch the train home to my humble abode in nunawading and spen the rest of the night watching anime.                                                                 aniways, this is a biiig blog. i had better put paragraphs in so although your reading it now all paragraphed, just imagine how it was without them eh? =^.^= hey, they are pretty crappy paragraphs cause of this stoopid blog. bet hey, i had better sign off now. anyone reading this who likes anime, read DRUSCILLOSKAYNE 's blog okies? its awesome.
okies adioso!

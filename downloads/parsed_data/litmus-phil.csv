I feel like that almost every day, but especially today.  It's our 2 year anniversary!  I really wish I could have been with her today, but I had work...and a really bad cold.  Seriously, I looked like death warmed over this morning.

I can't believe we've been together two years.  It's been quite a rollercoaster ride the past two years, but I can't think of anyone I'd rather ride that rollercoaster with than Em.  I've never felt so happy, so content, so utterly perfect and safe and warm than when I do with her.

Here's to two of the happiest years of my life...and looking forward to many, many more!"

"event","It's time to be honest with myself on certain things, like eating.  I've made two observations about my ""natural"" eating habits a lot in the past month:

1. When I eat alone, I overeat.  I eat relatively well when I'm with my family, or with Em, or my coworkers, or anybody...but when I'm by myself I find myself in the drive-thru at McDonald's or with my face buried in another bowl of ice cream or chips.

2. Speaking of the drive-thru, I eat out way too much.  I would have so much more money at the end of the day if I didn't eat out, money that could be spent on paying off my credit card, or my line of credit, or buying flowers for my sweetheart, or on a hobby (and playing poker at the Bruder's is not a hobby).

I've been plotting for the last week where to make changes in these eating habits, what would challenge me to eat better and lose weight and what was still practical.  After much thought, this is what I've decided:

1. I am not allowed to eat alone.  Other people don't necessarily have to eat with me, but I'm not allowed to be eating while I'm by myself.  Breakfast can be at home with family or at the office on ""Bagel Wednesday"".  Lunch can be with classmates in the MU or with coworkers.  Dinner should be at home, but occassionally with volunteers (although any of these with my sweetheart would be preferred over anything else!)

2. I am not allowed to eat at any restaurant that has a drive-thru window.  Period.  No questions asked.  Just because we have choir socials at Dairy Queen doesn't mean I have to get the chocolate chip cookie dough blizzard.

3. I am allowed to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner out one time per week.  This seems like a lot for most people, but for me it's cutting way back.  As much as I enjoy cooking Em and I always end up going out (assuming we remember to eat!).  And I enjoy eating out with Em, or with my family, or with my coworkers, and this way I don't have to give up IHOP with Em (at least till I get you one of the plants) or anchovy pizza with Deacon Gene.  Good conversation makes the food taste better anyway.

As for what food is acceptable:

Breakfast should be cereal or oatmeal with a piece of fruit.  If mom's making something special like eggs or biscuits, I'm going to eat it, but the donuts and danish are off-limits at breakfast.

Morning snack should be a piece of fruit, if I'm hungry.  Otherwise, just a cup of coffee.

Lunch should be a sandwich (meat and cheese on whole wheat bread, no mayo) or a salad (with low-fat or fat free dressing) and water or diet soda.

Afternoon snack should be a Zone Bar (210-220 calories -- seems like a lot, but some nights I don't get dinner till 830 or 9 at night).

Dinner is whatever the family is cooking (or has cooked already), keeping to lean meats or fish, a starch, and a vegetable as our normal meal, with water or diet soda to drink.

Dessert is acceptable, as long as I'm eating with someone else!  This is one meal where someone must be eating with me, not just be with me.

My exercise plan:

Any day that I work, I must work out for at least a half hour.  I will either start working out more or start working less, either of which would be beneficial to my overall cardiovascular health.

Wow this is a long post for me!  But I needed to say it.  I know that those of you reading this (especially you, Em) will keep my honest with myself on my progress!"

"event","Today was a very nice mix of prayerfulness and silliness.  Mass was beautiful this morning.  It was the first time I've ever been anointed at a healing Mass, and it felt very powerful, very moving.  It gave me the strength to reflect on some areas of my life where I don't take my faith as seriously as I should, and some things to talk about with my confessor tomorrow.  Stations this evening was very prayerful too.  I love the devotion of Stations of the Cross, and even though I sometimes am tired of the repetitiveness of the stations we use at All Saints, there's something about the reflections that always speaks to me.

My daily funny: So before stations, this man stops me.  ""Hey, tony (all the old people call me tony, I don't get it), I got a question for ya.  I'm 73, do I still have to fast?""  I told him that he didn't, but he still needed to abstain from meat on Fridays of Lent.  The man replied, ""I knew it!  My wife will do anything to get outta cooking dinner!""

Okay, back to being reflective...

Lately I've been overworking big time...I won't say how big, but very big.  I've let my grades suffer (B's, and I know I can do better in these classes), I've let my prayer life suffer, and I've let my relationships with the people I love suffer because I pour myself into my work instead of into what really matters in life.  Now that I think about it, I think I've written this journal message before...sometimes it takes multiple attempts to learn a lesson.  I read Em's Xanga where she was talking about the Carrie Underwood song ""Jesus Take the Wheel,"" and how she needs it in her life right now with medical school.  Seeing that really made me pause and say, ""Yes...that's it...I'm not the driver here...YOU are!""  I'm trying to control the situations in my life, and I have no control over them...""Grant that I may love you always, and then do with me as you will"" from stations tonight.  My first responsibility is not to DO, but to LOVE, and to show that love to my girlfriend, my family, my God, my friends, and to everyone I encounter in life.  Only then can I do, not my will, but His.

Countdown to see Em again: 7 days too many!  But I can't visit now while she's studying for midterms.  Although I'd encourage her to check her mail sometime around 12 noon tomorrow ;-)

Now, to paraphrase the words of Blessed Pope John XXVIII:  ""It's your church, [your world, my life in your hands,] Lord.  I'm going to bed."""

I think I should give up church for Lent after the afternoon I had!  Nothing was ready.  NOTHING!  the decorations were all over the place, the handouts weren't put together, the bulletins weren't run!  At least one part was kinda funny...our maintenance crew threw out the dead tree branches a parishioner cut for us to help decorate the baptismal pool.  We needed something to take its place...so...Father and I get into the golf cart, grab a lopper and start scouring the parish grounds for any low branches.  At one point we couldn't reach where we wanted to saw (because we men always assume we're taller than we are) so I reached up, grabbed the end of the branch and ripped it off the tree!  (It's the confidence that new buddy icon gives me!)

Oh...and at one point tonight I compared ""Alleluia"" to a Cheeseburger!  But, my laundry's done...anyone who wants to hear that story will have to call me. ;-)"

I'll be at church from 3pm this afternoon until 2pm tomorrow afternoon, with a break to sleep 4 hours and open presents with the familia.

Your brain: 100% interpersonal, 80% visual, 60% verbal, and 160% mathematical!
 
Congratulations on being 400% smart! Actually, on my test, everyone is. The above score breaks down what kind of thinking you most enjoy doing. A score above 100% means you use that kind of thinking more than average, and a score below 100% means you use it less. It says nothing about how good you are at any one, just how interested you are in each, relatively. A substantial difference in scores between two people means, conclusively, that they are different kinds of thinkers. 

Matching Summary: Each of us has different tastes. Still, I offer the following advice, which I think is obvious:


Don't date someone if your interpersonal percentages differ by more than 80%. 
Don't be friends with someone if your verbal percentages differ by more than 100%. 
Don't have sex with someone if their math percentage is over 200%.


My test tracked 4 variables How you compared to other people your age and gender:
  
 You scored higher than 65% on interpersonal 
  
 You scored higher than 30% on visual 
  
 You scored higher than 36% on verbal 
  
 You scored higher than 69% on mathematical

THE LEADER by anonymous 

Patient and steady with all he must bear, 
Ready to meet every challenge with care, 
Easy in manner, yet solid as steel, 
Strong in his faith, refreshingly real.
Isn't afraid to propose what is bold, 
Doesn't conform to the usual mould, 
Eyes that have foresight, for hindsight won't do, 
Never backs down when he sees what is true, 
Tells it all straight, and means it all too. 
Going forward and knowing he's right, 
Even when doubted for why he would fight, 
Over and over he makes his case clear, 
Reaching to touch the ones who won't hear. 
Growing in strength he won't be unnerved, 
Ever assuring he'll stand by his word. 
Wanting the world to join his firm stand, 
Bracing for war, but praying for peace,
Using his power so evil will cease,
So much a leader and worthy of trust,
Here stands a man who will do what he must."

Well...Here I am!

(And I've used ""well..."" far too many times in this post already.  Odd.  Very Odd.)

I miss Em so much right now.  I know she has a LOT of studying to do so I'm trying to resist the urge to call her every five minutes.  I'm happy that I get to call her every morning, even if it's just for two minutes.  But it's soooo hard being two hours away.  If I don't see my sweetheart soon I may be committed to the funny farm!  (which is not the same as a laugh factory).

I think I'll bury myself in work this week.  I have to arrange all of our music for Christmas for 5 violins, 1 cello, 1 double bass, 2 flutes, 2 clarinets, 1 bass clarinet, 1 alto sax, 1 tenor sax, 1 trumpet, 2 acoustic guitars, 1 electric guitar, 1 electric bass, drumset, and tympani.  I foresee many an early morning in front of my computer writing in finale before Sunday's music pass-out.

Speaking of work, three priests from the east valley have been in the news in the past week.  Thankfully, the one from our parish is in the news for all the RIGHT reasons.  Fr. Mitchell received the Presidential Volunteer Service Medal on Monday from President Bush during his visit to Phoenix.  Fr. Mitchell has volunteered with at-risk teens and young adults at the Canyon State Acadamy and Project ChalleNGe for over 20 years.  Way to go Fr. Mitchell!

The other two priests' goings-on don't deserve my precious posting time.  'Nuff said.

"event","Since my *beautiful* girlfriend asked me to start updating my journal, here we go... we'll start with a survey:


*Name:  Tony B.P.C.


*Write 6 facts about yourself as a child:
1.  In 4th grade, we used to have farting contests.  I would always win, as my farting to the tune of America the Beautiful was unbeatable.
2.  When I was in 8th grade, I wanted the be the white power ranger.  His mega-zord was by far the best.
3.  Once someone dared me to eat one of Sandy's dog biscuits.  You know, they really aren't too bad.  Liver has a pretty good flavor... after that, the house was usually short on dog biscuits.
4.  Every year until 11th grade I stayed up late on Christmas Eve waiting for Santa.  I just must not have stayed up late enough, because I could never catch him.  Sneaky old man.
5.  In 10th grade, after school my friends and I would meet at 4pm on the dot to act out Xena:  Warrior Princess.  I never missed a day.
6.  When I was 11, I had strawberry shortcake on my sheets, and I used to pretend she was my girlfriend.  Gosh if only Emily would get that floppy hat of hers...


*Write 6 little known facts about yourself now:
1.  I am tone deaf.  This could be a bad thing if it got out...
2.  When I can't sleep sometimes, I turn on the home shopping network.  There is something so soothing about watching them display those Diamondique bracelets.
3.  I dream of one day owning a ferret.
4.  Speaking of sleeping, I feel most comfortable sleeping in my He-Man, Master of the Universe footie pajamas.
5.  I have a huge phobia of flying insects.  Those ladybugs are so aggressive sometimes.
6.  I plan on naming my first son Bruce.  


Speaking of Bruce...


Second Bruce: G'day, Bruce!

Michael: No, it's Michael.

Second Bruce: That's going to cause a little confusion.

Third Bruce: Mind if we call you ""Bruce"" to keep it clear?

Fourth Bruce: Gentlemen, I think we better start the faculty meeting. Before we start, though, I'd like to ask the padre for a prayer.

Everybruce: Amen!

Fourth Bruce: Crack tubes! (Sound of cans opening) Now I call upon Bruce to officially welcome Mr. Baldwin to the philosophy faculty.

Second Bruce: I'd like to welcome the pommey bastard to God's own Earth, and remind him that we don't like stuck-up sticky-beaks here.

Everybruce: Hear, hear! Well spoken, Bruce!

Fourth Bruce: Bruce here teaches classical philosophy, Bruce there teaches Haegelian philosophy, and Bruce here teaches logical positivism. And is also in charge of the sheep dip.

First Bruce: This here's the wattle, the emblem of our land. You can stick it in a bottle, you can hold it in your hand.

Everybruce: Amen!

(NB: The Album versions continue with the Philosopher's song The TV version continues below....) 

First Bruce: Right, let's get some Sheilas. 

(An Aborigine bunts in with an enormous tray full of enormous steaks.) 

Fourth Bruce: OK. 

Second Bruce: Ah, elevenses. 

Third Bruce: This should tide us over 'til lunchtime.

Immanuel Kant was a real piss-ant who was very rarely stable.
Heideggar, Heideggar was a boozy beggar who could think you under the table.
David Hume could out-consume Wilhelm Freidrich Hegel.

There's nothing Nieizsche couldn't teach 'ya 'bout the raising of the wrist.
Socrates, himself, was permanently pissed.
John Stewart Mill, of his own free will, after half a pint of shanty was particularly ill.
Plato, they say, could stick it away, half a crate of whiskey every day!
Aristotle, Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle,
And Hobbes was fond of his Dram.
And Rene Descartes was a drunken fart:
""I drink, therefore I am.""
Yes, Socrates himself is particularly missed;
A lovely little thinker, but a bugger when he's pissed."

"event","Well, I don't post much in here, and I need a good place to keep a log of what I'm doing towards losing weight...so I think I'll start putting it here.  I know...it's not very interesting...in fact, it sounds pretty boring....but I gotta do it!

I'm using the dietary guidelines for the ""new food pyramid"" http://www.mypyramid.gov <-- don't go to .org or else you'll get a fake site!  For a 22 year old ""sedentary"" male, my goals are:

Calories: 2400
Grains: 8 oz
Vegetables: 3 cups
Fruits: 2 cups
Milk/Dairy: 3 cups
Meat: 6.5 ounces
Total Fat: 30% or less
Sat Fat: 10% or less
Cholesterol: 300 mg or less
Sodium: 1800-2300 mg

Future posts will tell you what I ate...and how I did.  I know all my buddies out there have dealt with wanting to lose weight at one point or another...so I will take any pointers or advice you want to give!"

I am blessed to have life in a world where so many lives are taken through acts of violence or hate.

I am blessed to be a Catholic in a world that is afraid to always believe in God.

I am blessed to have parents who love me in a world where so many children are abandoned.

I am blessed to have a girlfriend who loves me from the heart in a world where people are afraid to love.

I am blessed to have old friends who struggle to keep in touch in a world where time seems to pass without a second's thought.

I am blessed to have new friends in a world where people are afraid to reach out to each other.

I am blessed to have food in a world where so many people starve.

I am blessed to have a job in a world where so many are unemployed.

I am blessed to have a job that makes a difference to others in a world where so many must settle for unsatisfying work for unsatisfying pay.

I am blessed to have the intelligence to go to school in a world where intelligence is neglected for the easy fix.

I am blessed to have a car that runs in a world where some people never leave home in their entire lives.

I am blessed to know that the most important things in life are at the top of this list, not the bottom!"

I order my cup of coffee and something off the breakfast menu, and wait.  As the waitress comes over to bring my food, she asks me if I remember the man sitting at the booth next to me.  I told her yes, so she replied, ""he paid for your meal, he says it's an early Christmas present.""  I don't know what I did to deserve it (maybe I rushed out of the house this morning and looked like I was broke), but that was so nice of him!"

Anthony

The name of Anthony gives you a clever, quick, analytical mind, but you suffer with a great deal of self-consciousness, lack of confidence, and much aloneness because of misunderstandings. Your idealistic and sensitive nature gives you a deep appreciation for the finer things of life and a strong desire to be of service to humanity. There are times when you experience inner turbulence at your inability to say what you mean. It is far easier for you to express your deeper thoughts and feelings through writing than verbally. You find pleasure in literature, in poetry, and in your ideals and will turn to them when you feel you have been misunderstood. You are deeply moved by the beauties of life, especially nature. Because your feelings run deep, you must guard against the ups and downs, being very inspired one minute, then moody, reserved, and depressed the next. Your reactions to people vary according to how you feel. You tend to be secretive and noncommittal about private matters, yet at times you will talk effusively in order to hide your self-consciousness or to lead others away from personal subjects. You are inspired by encouragement from others, yet suspicious of their intent. You crave affection but seldom find anyone who understands your nature. Physical weaknesses would show in your heart, lungs, or bronchial organs."

I came back much earlier than I wanted to the next morning because I had to sing for a wedding, but it was a very nice wedding.  I knew the bride and groom from their involvement at the parish, which always makes it nicer for me to sing (it's more than just a paycheck).  After that, meetings with Youth Ministry, fixing the sound system in the church, early dinner, and an early bedtime.

Sunday was Mass (of course!), homework, and laundry.  Simple yet rewarding.  Mom and Dad rearranged the kitchen while I was gone to give dad more counterspace.  he starts Culinary school tomorrow, how exciting for him!  Okay, enough rambling from me!"

"event","Father's homily at Mass this morning was quite good.  He talked about our need for patience and perseverance in the Lord, and that what we ask for from the Lord happens in His time, not our own.  There's so much I want to happen right now.  I want to be done with my schooling and move on with my life.  I want to be with Emily, I miss her so much.  I want the choirs to realize their full potential and be the best choirs this parish has ever seen.  But all of that takes time, and the timetable is in God's hands, not mine.

At the same time, Father pointed out that while trusting in God, we must serve as instruments of God's plan.  ""If you had faith but the size of a mustard seed...""  My faith must transform myself and the lives of those around me through prayer and action.  Instead of wishing for school to be over, I can give my 100% best focus whenever I have to chance to for my schooling.  I pray for Emily, for her success and happiness and that we can be together soon, and hopefully show her every time I can how important she is to me.  I know the choirs can only reach their full potential if I, as their director, bring out the talents they hold inside of them and nourish them with prayer and practice."

"event","The good (and not so good) of the weekend:

Not so good (I mean, come on, let's get this part over with!):
- ethics readings that really tick me off.  To say that ""unborn babies aren't real persons, just like the mentally handicapped"" really annoys me.  Actually ... to say that I was annoyed would be like calling having your head chopped off a paper cut.
- RUDE parents.  we had confirmation orientation this afternoon.  One parent pulled his son out of the class because her degree is in religious studies, making her ""incompetent"" to teach Catholicism.  I dunno buddy, but if two priests with theology degrees think she's ok, I'm gonna trust them.

Good stuff:
+ 12pm choir was on fire today.  7 singers, piano, 2 guitar, bass, drumset, congas, & flute.  The congregation was larger and more responsive, and the choir's getting into it more too.  I think having the sound pro come and fix the system was a huge help, we could actually hear each other in the choir area.
+ a 95% average on my species counterpoint homework.  Of course, all species counterpoint is is following rules, and that's about how often I follow the rules with everything else, so it's par for the course.
+ E-cards from very special people who always now how to make me ""light up"" :-)

Next week:  easy week for school...lots of meetings at work.  Wedding saturday to sing for (couple converted last year, so they know me through the OCI program -- always more fun to sing for people you know!)"

I went to the music composition studio recital last night.  There were some...umm...interesting pieces.  Some highlights:

-- I didn't know that japanese karaoke music forms were studied at ASU!
-- I didn't know that augmented and diminished chords were supposed to create a ""pastoral"" feel of an April afternoon
-- I didn't know fortune cookies, playground taunting, and warning labels made for really good song lyrics.

I had a 97% on my first ethics test -- I guess it's because I'm such an ethical person.  I think I aced my melodic dictation test for theory -- I should find out on Thursday.

Choir practice was great tonight...except that my conga stand was broken, so I had to stick the drum between my legs to play it, but it worked.  This Sunday is a special Mass for all the RE and YM teachers at the 12pm, so we're tying in music realating to the readings on stewardship to our call to service to others.  It will be wonderful!

Agenda for the week...Papers due tomorrow and thursday...theory test friday...server training tomorrow...children's choir thursday...this weekend?  who knows -- I'm open to suggestions."

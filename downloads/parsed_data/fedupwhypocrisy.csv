"event","Why do a substantial about of self-reflecting essays start with ""If only I could. . .""? If only I could muster up the courage to ask someone out. If only I could make a million dollars. If only I was skinnier. Well if only we could see past the if onlys. What about having faith in yourself. Thats the one thing we need to concentrate. I only is a thing for the past not for the future. There are ways to make things happen for yourself and its not by saying if only I could.

And why is life always too short. When the hell is life going to be too damn long or long enough. 
You can get a lot of shit done in a life time. If you would just buckle the fuck down and do it. 

And why do we always want what others have. fuck what others have they have it for a reason, because somewhere along the line someone worked for it. It may not have been them it might have been there great great grandpa or they might have won the lottery. But don't you wish that in your life time you will win the lottery or that you could make enough money that even your great great grandchild will be taken care of? Pretty damn sure you would.

Instead of wondering all these things why don't we appreciate who and what we have and work for bigger and greater things?"

"event","So you always think that when you're watching tv shows about murders and suicides that you are so happy its just TV. You thank god that it doesn't really happen that its dramatized for entertainment. Thats how I always thought of it. well til last thursday.

So as of thursday my sister had been gone since sunday and we didn't know where she was. So i spend the early part of my day off driving around portage lakes looking for her car; since that was where her new boyfriend supposedly lived.

I gave up around 2 and went home to bake a cake for Amy's birthday and to work on stained glass, homework, cleaning etc. Around four my dad called and said that my sister's friend Emily had called and said if I came to pick her up she would show me how to get to where she thought my sister was. So of course I dropped what I was doing to see if my sister was okay, at least alive. 

So I pick Emily up and she tells me she thinks he's at Jojos. Thanks for telling me now that I drove all the way past JoJo's house to come out and get you so I can drive all the way back to his house and then all the way back here to drop you the fuck off. 

So anyways we get there and its a shotty little brick house with cardboard over the windows.  and you had to bolt the front door to keep it shut or it would be flying open. Anyways so my sister is lying on the bed that's missing a leg and is lopsided and I get her out of bed and get her outside to smoke a cigarette with me and tell me what was up. 

So we are outside smoking a cigarette when jojo comes around the front of the house. And I didn't realize what was wrong at first. It looked like he had sores on his face but as he got closer I realized they were cut marks. and he was bleeding and not only that his arm was bleeding too it was completely red with blood and he had a phone cord around his neck. 
He had been trying to kill himself. He was cutting himself and trying to strangle himself. And he's threatening to stab himself in the stomach and end it all as he's shaking and yelling ""I don't know.""

They managed to get one knife away from him and he went back for another and took off in the backyard. We got in our cars and I got stuck chasing after him with Emily while my sister got blocked in the drive by the three cop cars and the ambulance that we had called. 

So Emily and I saw him driving his friends car and pulled up next to him and he was threatening to stab himself if she didn't come talk to him. So he kept pulling the knife out and thrusting it down till she yelled stop just in time to avoid him penetrating the flesh. Eventually she talked to him into dropping the knife and meeting somewhere to talk. I got the lovely job of picking up the bloody fleshy knife off the ground so he wouldn't come back for it. I touched a suicidal drug addicts knife he had stabbed himself with in an attempt to end his life. I saw a guy try and kill himself in front of me. 

Jojo is still alive we got the cops there before he did anything else.

I still had to deal with the trauma after words. I had to deal with the what could have happened and what did happen. I had to deal with feeling like my hands were dirty. And the guilt of thinking I could have done more. I should have done more. But I didn't and i have to learn to be okay with that and I will. 

You can say what you would have done. You can say what you think i should have done. You can say it was a desperate attempt for attention, but when you're there its different. You want to do anything you can to stop him and you want to run at the same time. All I can say is it's over its done and it might be the most important lesson I ever learned."

I spend all day either at work or at school and then I get home and start unpacking more shit or clean up the kitchen or sweep up chips of paint from peeling wall paper. It seems like I don't have a whole lot of time for me. 

And I am sick of being single. I think it would be a lot easier if I had someone to share these things with, someone other than my roommates or family. Misha's great to talk to and I love her dearly but she can only be my plutonic life partner. ; ). Well anywas. hopefully I find someone soon."

I love performing arts and visual arts and I appreciate both. I don't know that I am talented in both. I would like to think so but more often I am complimented on my ability in visual arts. So I am trying a bunch of different things to decide which I like best. I am working on some jewelry designs and some fashion projects and I am working with a friend from work on some stained glass. 

Through it all I would like to think that my parents support me but that hasn't been the case in any matter. My dad complains that I have to much going on and my mom is rather indifferent. Is it too much to ask for a little support instead of constant negativity."

I am working at Don Drumm Studios in Akron, Ohio now and it is an awesome job. I love everything about working there even the not-so-great pay. I can't think of very many other jobs where you get to giftwrap all day (among other things). Everyone there is really accepting for the most part it's almost like the island of misfit toy, except we like being there and we like being with each other and there really isn't any longing to leave.

"event","So I was on here earlier and I got to thinking about how it had been forever since I had written anything. I mean I got my tatoo months ago. I have just been really busy with work and friends and family drama. 

My uncle, my dad's brother, has been sick for a while and has liver cancer. He's getting sicker and sicker. And he needs someone to donate a part of their liver so that his can be rejuvenated. So the prime choice according to my dad's side of the family is, of course, my dad. 

Which I would have no problem with if my dad was close with his side of the family but we're not and we haven't been for a long time. Forever. . . or at least as long as I can remember. We've gotten together for Holidays and special occassions (i.e weddings, graduations, baby showers, etc.) And besides that the only time my dad's family ever talked to us is if they needed something. Wow. . . that unsurprisingly sounds like now!

So anyways. . . Living donor transplants are pretty rare due to the possible side effects and such. My dad for example could get an infection which could spread. What I mean is it is a high risk procedure there is possibility of death. Its not a pretty thing. Let alone the fact that it could be up to three months off work! My dad gets sick pay and all that jazz but hello! Sick pay basically sucks. Not that we are really tight for money but it sure as hell wouldn't be easy either. 

On top of that we don't know if they are even a match. My dad and his brother are only half brothers. And for the reasons my uncle has liver cancer he is towards the bottom of the donor list. He has it from alcoholism and drug use. 

My uncle can't obviously work so he doesn't have insurance to pay for the procedure and we also have to find a way for my dad to get the money for the procedure because generally the person who is getting the liver has their insurance pay for it. Where as the Doner's insurance doesn't cover. 

And my dads family has been helping out with their bills before he started gettins social security. And they have no money because his wife doesn't work either. So we paid their $600 rent one month. But somehow they can afford to have a heater for their pool which isn't cheap. And they can go to the zoo and pay for 6 people to eat there! BULL SHIT! 

IT'S NOT MY FAULT IT TOOK YOU FINDING OUT YOU ARE ALMOST DEAD FROM DOING FUCKING DRUGS YOUR WHOLE LIFE! WHY SHOULD MY DAD PUT HIS FREAKING LIFE ON THE LINE!"

"event","I have been planning for probably close to two months now to get a tatoo with my friend Jenna but it never worked out that we both had the money on the same week. Well I decided that I had to hurry up and get mine with or without her because I am going to Savannah in less than a month and you are not allowed to go swimming in salt or chlorine, sit in Saunas or lay out or go to a tanning bed for like two weeks and I am leaving in three. So I got my tatoo on Tuesday I LOVE IT! Its of a sun and it is on my back to the lower right. I even designed it myself.

Jenna, Lindsay and Denise went and watched me get it done. It was a lot less painful than I thought it would be and it took a lot less time than I thought it would. It took maybe 30 minutes. Of course it isn't that big.

And I told my mom and dad; both of which I thought were going to flip. Neither of them were that found of it especially my dad but there was no yelling or flipping out. My mom even told me yesterday that she liked it but I shouldn't get anymore, which is fine with me. I only wanted the one anyways."

I told Chris and he told me his honest opinion and I snapped at him, because I am afraid. I am afraid that is how everyone is going to feel and I don't want them to feel that way even though they probably should. I want them to be happy for the decision I am making. Because to tell you the truth. I can't handle this anymore. I can't handle living here with my parents who don't know about me and wouldn't accept me if they did. I am sick of loving to people that will never love me the same way back. Honestly sometimes death seems like a bittersweet option but I have never been one to give up and thats what I think a suicide would be. And then I look and think I am being over dramatic and thats how everyone will view this. And it probably is, everyone probably has these feels and these problems and I am just another lonely sad person that will never be happy."

I had a dream that we were dating. And we were like on vacation or something I think it might have been New York. And we were strolling the cities and checking out the sites and Adam and I were continuously flirting, holding hands, grabbing each others butt (his is nice ;P). and making out. 

It was a lengthy dream I remember, but I don't remember all the details. All I remember is we ended up at a club at the end of the night where adam and I continued to act like we had all night only now we were dancing and grinding on each other in addition to the other things.

"event","Well I have approximately 7 minutes to write my journal because then I have to leave for work. 

I am house sitting for my aunt this week and I was really excited at first and now I am starting to think it isn't as great as I thought it would be. She has a decent house for one person it is big enough with two bedrooms, one bath a kitchen, dining room and living room and a huge basement which is unfortunately unfinished. 

She has two dogs and that is the reason I am over here. To watch them. And they are crazy and spoiled! I can honestly say after spending two days with them that Ernie has secured his spot as my favorite cousin. 

First thing i did when I got here last night was to cut my hair. Yes thats right I cut my own hair. And it doesn't look half bad. I also colored it and it was supposed to be a dark reddish brown. Well anyone who has died their hair that color has probably had a similar experience. it looks more reddish purple! Ughh. I don't really like the color but I am beginning to think it will grow on me. 

There was no food when I got here last night, well nothing snackish anyway. All I wanted was popcorn which she said she had but I couldn't find. She has a single cup coffee maker wich she supposedly uses to make warm water. I have no idea how to use it and she lacks a teapot and I was going to try some of this hot chocolate she has. OF course none of it is regular hot chocolate so none of them were that great. 

She left me money for groceries which I didn't think would be enough but actually I spent less and am starting to think it will be too much food for the four or five days that I will be here. 

My cousin, yes I am talking about the dog, got on the bed yesterday and I think she was wet from the snow. At least that is what I am hoping because if not that means she peed on the bed. Don't worry I washed the comforter because that was the only thing she got it on. But ughh. . . House sitting is nothing like what it would be having your own apartment. At least not if I had one. I made a list of all the things I need to buy for when I get my apartment with Lindsay, Hopefully next winter. 

Well I already took eight minutes and I only had seven so I guess that is all for now!"

Last night I had a dream that I met some gorgeous guy! (You know it was a dream just from that.) And we decided we were going to try and find a job together and where did we get applications? Express and Victoria secrets. Now if that dream doesn't mean I am gay. I don't know what does."

Chris I know I have apologized a number of times already. But like I said I know you didn't need that in addition to everything else. Mandy told me that you said that I had blamed everything on the two of you, and I definitely didn't want to make it sound like it was all your fault because it definitely wasn't. It wasn't anyones fault and if it was then it was mine. 

I don't want anything to be different between us because you are one of my very best friends! I treasure our friendship more than most and I don't want to lose that! 

So all I can say is I hope things don't change, because they haven't for me."

"event","So as you all know but maybe don't remember last night was New Years Eve! And mine was an interesting one to say the least. First of all we decided to wait until 9 o'clock to get alcohol. Bad idea! The only place open was sheetz and Lindsay's Parents Liquor Cabinet. lol. So we went to Sheetz and got what we could and then after we realized we didn't have anything Lindsay called her parents and got the Ok to raid their liqour cabinet. 

After raiding Lindsay's Liqour cabinet we started heading towards Jims house which took us around an hour to an hour and a half for a 25 minute drive. I ended up in Marshallville and Mount Eaton aka Amish Country. With no idea how I got there or how to get out ( no I was not drunk. . . yet.)

We had three people helping us figure out where we were and how to get to Massilion and we eventually ended up having to pull over and ask a cop. ughh. Moral of the story. Don't depend on Joe to know directions. 

We ended up at Jims at maybe 10 til midnight when we should've been there between 10 and 10:30. Mandy called me at midnight! I love her she is such a sweet heart! And then Caralyn called and Lindsay answered the phone and was gonna tell her Happy New Year but Caralyn snapped at her to give me the phone so Lindsay is done feeling sorry for her and we can continue to ignore her thank god!

But we proceeded to drink from then on and stopped at about 5 in the morning. I wasn't completely plastered but I was drunk and so was Christina and Erica wasn't because she said she couldn't swallow her throat was swollen and Lindsay and Jim were completely gone. 

Denise showed up at about 2 in the morning and she brought Jenna and Jenna brought Ben! Bad idea. We invited Jenna because we thought Ben had ditched her not because we wanted her to bring him. So now Jim hates Jenna even more. Ughh drama. 

But Even though we didn't fall asleep until 5 or 6 Jim still got up and went to work at 8! ugh. . So we all woke up and cleaned when he left and then I was hope by 9:15 and fell asleep until 12:15. and I am still tired! Lol. But all in all it was a fun night at one point my eyes hurt because they were so dry from crying because I was laughing so hard. It was a lot of fun. Minus the whole Ben situation.

Oh and I behaved myself, lol most people thought I couldn't."

"event","I hung out with Chris yesterday. Of course I had a great time. Of course I felt very unaccomplished because we were looking for three things that he really needed to buy and we didn't find anything. 

We went to summit mall and shopped around where we successfully bought nothing and then we went to eat at Chilis after we went to Macaroni Grill and found the resturaunt half empty with a 50 minute wait. Of course we can never decide where to eat. So it took forever to pic somewhere and it really stressed Chris out and I felt bad. And then at Chilis he ordered Basil Pasta and they gave him chicken basil pasta. Ughhh. Stupid people. But it was a nice meal none the less. Then we went to World Market, where he bought some England Coaster things. Next we went to Barnes and Noble and he bought a calender and I bought a daily calender and a book. 

Then we went to Walm and saw Mandy and then to Starb, lol sorry Mandy. And then to Kohls and then he brought me home. 

We exchanged presents too. He got me the James Blunt CD. and it is awesome and a book that I have looked at a hundred times and have been tempted to buy everytime. I can't wait to start reading it but I have to finish the one I am reading now first. And I bought him a book on Wales. I was afraid he already had it but he didn't. : ). 

I had a great time. I feel bad because I didn't make more of an effort to hang out with him more while he was home even though we hung out more this time than before. It makes me sad to think that he is going back on Saturday, or that I am not going back with him. Lol. I haven't decided which. : P. He's an awesome person and even a better friend."

"event","This test only has one question, but it's a very important one. By giving an honest answer, you will discover where you stand morally. The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation in which you have to make a decision. 

Remember your answer needs to be honest, yet spontaneous. Please scroll down slowly and give due consideration to each line. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

THE SITUATION

You are in New Orleans. There is chaos all around you caused by a hurricane with severe flooding. This is a flood of biblical proportions. 

You are a photojournalist working for a major newspaper, and you're caught in the middle of this epic disaster.  The situation is nearly hopeless.

You're trying to shoot career-making photos.

There are houses and people swirling around you, some disappearing under the water. Nature is unleashing all its destructive fury.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suddenly you see a man in the water.  He is fighting for his life, tyring not to be taken down with the debris.  You move closer. Somehow the man looks familiar.  YOu suddenly realize who it is.  It's the President, George W. Bush. At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him under forever. YOu have two options: you can save the live of the President, or you can shoot a dramatic Pulitzer Prize-winning photo, documenting the death of one of the world's most famous men.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE QUESTION.

Heres the question, and please give an honest answer. . . 

Would you select high-contrast color film, or would you go with the classic simplicity of black and white?

Always a bonus. Then I was supposed to take a computerized test for Psych but I decided I didn't want to take it today and more importantly I couldn't find my sheet with my id for the testing on it. 

So anyways me and Denise went to Friendly's and then to Walmart where we got flipflops for a dollar. Then we picked up my brother and went to see ""Just Like Heaven."" And it was great. We had a blast. 

Oh and I found out Chris got my ecard. Orginally I thought maybe he got it and thought I was crazy but that wasn't the case. lol. : )"

"event","I swear. I had a mood swing like a mother today. I was so pissed off at around 6 or 7 well actually since Denise texted me earlier today. She said that we need to leave Cory alone because what is going on is between them and we weren't supposed to worry about it.  

Obviously she didn't think that having to hear about it everyday when he treats her like shit doesn't get on our nerves. The only reason we ever said anything to her about him is because we were watching out for her because he was screwing with her. When someone has fallen for someone else they normally can't see what is going on. We all she he is messing with her and treating her like shit just like when I was dating Amber and everybody warned me I didn't listen because I didn't want to hear it. Luckily the situation with Amber wasn't as serious because she wasn't as minipulative as he was and because she might have cared about me at least a little bit. That is why she still says hi to me when she comes into Acme and trys to talk to me. Cory on the other hand doesn't want in a relationship with Denise he just wants her to be there. 

So anyways then I was irritated with the whole family situation and how Grandma and Dody are fighting because I love them both. I love Grandma I mean how could I not but I love Dody too. She is one of the people I am closest too. She has always been one of my best friends and she has always been there to help me out. So it is hard to see them at odds with each other but is also hard to hear everyone talk about Dody like its all her fault but that is because they don't want to hear her side of the story and even if they did she wouldn't want to incriminate her mom because she loves her to much even if they are fighting. 

And then there is Jamie and the constant shit she is pulling and that is enough to drive anyone crazy and it is really taking a toll on my parents which in turn takes a toll on the whole family so that is driving me crazy. 

On top of all that I am trying to figure out this college thing all by myself while trying to be successful and pay off bills and work as much as I can. It is enough drama to drive anyone crazy. So about an hour ago I was crying over the drama and wishing my grandpa was still alive and now I want to accomplish something to show that I am worth something that I can make something right in all these wrongs. 

Talk about a major mood swing. I don't know what is going on with me. This is absolutely crazy. I don't want to lose my best friend and I don't want my sister to keep in her downward spiral and I want my family to get along. Is that so much to ask. I am only one person and I can't fix it all myself. . . . the most I can do is try.

And meanwhile I have to worry about myself. I know that sounds selfish and it is but we all have to do it. So thats what I am going to do. I am trying so hard not to hurt anyone in the process or not to let anyone I love get hurt by anything else. But like I said all I can do is try"

Alyssa is in my psych class, Marie and I get along great and I also made friends with a couple of girls, Katie, Laura and I don't know the other ones name. But besides the mishap on monday class has been awesome adn now I don't have to be there until 9:55! Fantastic. But I am not full time so I am not covered under my parents insurance! THEY ARE GOING TO KILL ME WHEN I TELL THEM! but oh well. Well thats all for now!"

"event","Yesterday was probably one of the best days out of my summer. I went out to lunch at Steak and Shake with my Aunt Dody. She is like one of my best friends and we have so much fun when we hang out together. 

Then after we went to Steak and Shake we went to Akron U and got my books for school which she paid for. And I showed her around the new parts of campus that had been renovated since she had been there. 

Then I took her back to her house and she invited me back out for dinner becuase she was having my uncles family over. His two daughters, one niece and his parents. So I went over and hung out with them. THEY ARE HILARIOUS. I was laughing so hard my sides ached! It was awesome! I didn't end up leaving until about 9:30"

"event","So after all this drama with Adam I just want it to be over. I don't blame him at all for what happened the night I wrecked my car. It wasn't his fault Eric showed up and I don't even blame Eric for me wrecking my car. That was my own stupid fault. 

I love Adam to death and he was one of my best friends until Eric came around, part of that is because I am jealous I admit. But the bigger part is because I don't think Eric treats Adam as good as Adam deserves to be treated. And I would probably have forgiven Eric by now for the fight if he would just apologize to me. 

Eric has apologized to all of Adams other friends who were there that night, but not to me. I was the one he started crap with and he can't apologize to me. I don't know why he hates me, if its because he feels threatened by me he shouldn't because Adam loves him unfortunately and has never and probably never will do anything with me. 

Grumph!!!!!!!!!!!! What shit!"

"event","I dunno whats up with my whole family lately but no one can stand to be around one another and everyone is being a jerk to everyone else. 

So anyways I think it is because we are all stressed about my sister and still upset about my grandpas death. But I am sick of all of it. 

I get yelled at for no reason. Like today my mom keeps bitching about how i bought myself new clothes before my birthday. SO I got prolly 6 or 7 new outfits i could use more if thats what she really wanted. And it just seems like something is always my fault. Grr."

"event","So I guess Saturday Nights just aren't for me. The last Saturday I went out was when I got in my accident until this past Saturday and let me say there was no shortage of drama there! 

On Saturday my friends Lindsay and Jim had planned a surprise Party for my best friend Denise, so I of course was going and I had to pick up Paul on the way. So whatever la-di-dah. I go get Paul and then off I go to Denise's sister's house where Jim, Lindsay and Heidi already were and they decided it was time to start decorating and we were hanging up streamers but we didn't have any tape so I ran up to the convient store like two streets away and buy tape and cigarettes because I found out Adam was coming lol. (Cigarettes=anger management). 

So anyways when I come back I find out that Scottie found out about the party and told Denise. Ugh. Killing the element of surprise which, of course, is the key to a surprise party. So anyways we figure out a way to surprise her anyway and it is dropped. 

Then Erica and Jenna show up and they told us how they yelled at Scottie because he ruined the surprise. So later on Erica, Jenna, and I have to go to Acme to get cups, ice and candles. And Scottie and Erica were already fighting and it doesn't help that he has a huge crush on her and no chance of getting with her. (Such the drama) So of course she has to make sure she walks by him. So we are walking down aisle twelve when Scottie starts after us yelling at me! Why me? I had no idea. So he is yelling ""You fucking got something to say to me. . . You fucking got something to say to me Joe. Fucking say it"" And I was like ""Scottie what are you talking about."" I haven't done anything to you. ""Seriously what do you want?""

Then Erica turns around and tells Scottie ""Leave Joey alone! He had nothing to do with it! I said something not him. Leave Joey alone."" So then Scottie continues telling me he will ""throw down"" right there in Acme and blah blah blah bla blah. And then tells Erica he is sorry if he hurt her feelings and yells at Jenna because she isn't talking to him. 

So I figured it was over. Oh no. . . He called Jenna's Cellphone when we got back to Dee's party and said Jenna was a bitch, told Erica fuck her and me that I had an hour and a half to live. (It was 9:30 he worked till eleven.) So meanwhile I have people coming to back me up in this whole situation that I don't need help with. I mean Scottie is about as scary as a stuffed care bear ok. And he says he is bringing his boys but won't say who they are so then I figured it was some stock guys because they are the only ones who even pretend to be his friends. 

So 11 o'clock roles around the other stock guys show but he doesn't. . . so we all figured he chickened out. OH no five minutes after the rest of stock get there Scottie rolls up with 2 or 3 other cars full of people to come kick my ass!

So Denise is already upset because Scottie is continuing to ruin her party and I am apologizing like crazy while telling her I have no idea why he wants to fight. So out file a bunch of Coventry football players! And Scottie stands out on the street calling me out. Well hell I am not going out there to fight a football team. He wants to fight me its gonna be me and him. He's no competition. 

Then Denise yells at them all to leave becuase she is not getting the cops called on her Birthday party and Scottie still won't leave.  So she let him in and told everyone else to leave. 

So Scottie comes inside and tells me that we need to go ""throw down"" outback and I was like ""Before we have any fucking fight. I wanna know why you wanna kick my ass!"" So he yells at me that I sent Erica, Jenna and Caralyn to yell at him and give him a hard time! Lol. I Didn't even know they yelled at him till after they told me! Lol. WTF! ANd so then he is like well ""whatever then we're cool!Sometimes you just gotta fight. That's what a man does. People running their mouths and you just gotta fight."" LIke WTF! I had nothing to do with it! He is such a stupid cavedweller. So then he is going to leave and he proceeds to tell us that he is going to smoke pot and get drunk! And Lindsay says ""at least it will improve your personality!"" SO then Dee was mad at her for provoking it further. And so Lindsay about cried and she left. 

Then I was worried about getting Jenna and Erica to come back because they left when Scottie and his posie showed up and Jenna was drunk. So I had to get them back there because they were spending the night. So anyways. They came back and we all got smashed. WEll me, Erica, Jenna and Paul but that is another story! lol. 

-oh by the way did I mention that I talked to one of the Coventry football players and they had no idea what the fight was about or that they were even supposed to be part of it. They just heard there was a fight so they were coming to watch! They didn't know what the fight was about, who Scottie was or that they were supposed to back him up! Lol."

I wrecked my car and my Aunt and my mom were in a fight and I was grounded and feeling sorry for my self because I totalled the car I had only had for 2 months. But anyways. . . .

Steph: OMG look its a black guy
Chris: :sarcastic: And he is fully clothed, talking on a cellphone and he's not in National Geographic!

And then there were the times when HAC was the cool thing and we loved Friendly's

Adam: ::Spills drink::
Waitress: Adam I can't believe you spilled your drink
Me: OMG She knows your name :Laughs uncontrollably::
HAC member: He's wearing his name tag
EVERYONE(including the table behind us) :Laughs uncontrollably:
10 minutes later
Mike B: OH I GET IT HE'S WEARING HIS NAME TAG! :Laughs uncontrollably:"

"event","I picked up my sister from the airport today. 
It was frustrating.
My mom was screaming at me in the car just because <i>she</i> couldn't find her.
Ugh, I'm use to it though. 

I hate the fact that she still doesn't get that I'm growing up and I'm leaving soon.
She needs to grow up and hit reality. 
I can't stay under the same roof with her forever. 

I'm gonna go look for a job soon, I need one. 

I hope this school year goes by fast. 

I miss all my old friends.

I miss Haley."

Why does it have to be like this? 
Why can't me and her just be together, always?
I want my own life with her. 
I'm really scared that someone might take her away or this distance rip us apart.
All I know is that I am never leaving her, ever.
<b>No matter what</b>. 
<b>I need you so much closer</b>.
I want her closer to me. 
She's all I have because my family isn't family and my friends aren't friends.
I cry myself to sleep almost everynight just because I miss her.
And I cry harder everytime.
Is this how love is suppose to be? 
So painful but yet so strong? 
I don't know where I'd be right now if I didn't have her.
This is all I live for, really. 
Nothing in my life has a point but her. 
She has the point of a lifetime that keeps me going. 
I know that one day, just one day.. 
me and her will <i>finally</i> be happy together. 
3-4 more years is all that's left. 
I get my permit before December and I know I'm gonna be seeing her a lot more.
Soon enough I'll have my license and even if I have to, I'll move to Largo all by myself. 
I don't care, as long as I'm next to her.. closer. 
That's all I want, she's all I want. 
I hate waiting but that's all we can do.
Just know that I'm <b>never</b> leaving you & that I love you with everything in me.

Everything on the way there always seems so.. perfect & peaceful.

Okay, so this is how the day went..
First Tucker picked me up at around 9:15 am and we decided to get gas and stop at Albertsons and get our girlfriends flowers since it was Haley special day. So we did. After that we got on the road and was ridiculously excited. We got to Largo at about 11 am and Tucker dropped me off at Denas. I was so nervous and I have no idea why. So I walked in and Nikki, Caity, Haley, Dena & Austin were there. Haha, I was so nervous that I put the roses outside of the door until Denas mom came in and said, ""Oh Dena, look are these from Austin?"" And I pointed to Haley and I was like, ""Noo."" Haha, and Haley gave me a weird look and Denas mom was like, ""Here Haley, take them."" Haley was like, ""Nope, I'm not taking them."" But then she did so they just put them in water. We all went to Starkey Elementry and it was hot as fuck. Did nothing but attempt to play basketball. Haha. After that we went back to Denas and just sat around until we went to Kristyns house because they were having a party since it was her birthday to.
We just sat around for about an hour then went to Caitys where me and Haley laid in Nikki's bed and cuddled while listening to Dashboard Confessional. I love her more and more each day. She's incredible. Then we went to The R/C Fun World or something like that to see Haleys mom! I was excited. I love her mom. Her mom's boyfriend is so fucking nice. I love him too. We had to leave soon though because we were going back to Caitys cause her boyfriend was waiting for her. Hah, Caity and Matt are so cute. Me and Haley cuddled again in Nikki's room to Taking Back Sunday. Haha. Then we went to Arrynes house and met her and she's really cool but her sister is weird. Me and Haley also cuddled in Arrynes room. Hah. I also saw Nat! That kid is the cutest. Haha. Arryne was like, ""Haley, Kory come on guys meet my friends!"" I walk out and I'm like, ""Nat!!!"" and he's like, ""OH MY GOD, KORY?! OH MY GOD IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU, HUG MAN, HUGGG!!!"" Haha, he's so fun. I was just standing and facing the road and Haley yelled at me and said, ""KORY, WATCH OUT!"" and Nat comes and slaps my ass. I'm like, ""Wow..fucker."" and I tried chasing him but I suck at running. I saw Mindy too! Haha, I jumped on her. I left Haley my OAKLAND jacket. I felt like she needed it more then me. Oh and Dena took a picture of me at Starkey Elementry so when I get it, I'll upload it. Basically today was fun. And it was awesome meeting everyone. <b>I miss Haley so much</b>. God, that girl is my life. It's <b>so</b> hard saying goodbye. Our hugs are usually 10 minutes long.

<font size=""4"">AND I HATE SAYING GOODBYE TO HER!</font size>
<img src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y297/acrossfrommay/245345jdlg.jpg"" border=""1"" alt=""""/>

And on the way back, I cried and everything felt empty.

Though it didn't look like it. 

Oh and to top off our day, we got a $180.90 speeding ticket and I got home 3 minutes before my mom did.
It was pretty damn close.

Over all, wonderful day.</center>"

"event","Haley, 
You mean everything to me. And I know just like you said in your entry that you're scared of other girls comming in my life, well.. <b><font size=""3"">I don't want them</b></font>. I want you and only you. Everytime I come see you, it <b>breaks</b> my heart to leave. To leave you just standing there.. alone. <b>Everytime</b> I say goodbye to you, I'm just so tempted to turn back and never leave your side. You have an effect on me that no one will ever have. Almost everynight, I cry myself to sleep because I miss you <b>so</b> much and it's just.. really hard. I want to be there with you, by your side. I hate seeing you like twice a month. I wish it was twice a day or something. <b>I just really fucking hate distance</b>. I know at times, I can be a pain in the ass. I know it, don't worry. I'm also insecure and selfish. More then you, actually. I only want to grow up to be with you and so we can live on our own. <b>That's all I want</b>. I want us, together under one roof.. not just under the same sky. Your name never stops from comming out of my mouth. <b>You'll never know how much you mean to me</b>. Ever. You're more then I ever needed. Really. You mean so fucking much to me. I don't know how else to tell you. You're on my mind, <b>constantly</b>. Not only do I want you in my life, I need you in my life. And all the promises I promised you, I'm gonna fulfill them. You put yourself down and I hate it. I hate it because I know I can do nothing about it. Why make yourself feel like shit? It's not worth it. All you're going to do is make yourself stress even more. And about your family life, I know it's hard. But what can we do? I don't have a perfect life either. No one does. My brother comes in 30 days and me just thinking that, makes me wanna get the fuck out of here even more because all that comes to mind is, ""when will I see Haley again, when can I hold her hand again and feel like no one else has made me feel before?"" I wanna fast forward life <b>so</b> bad so when the part of me and you living together, and we both share <i>our</i> lives, I can slow it down so forever doesn't come so soon. You don't know how bad I just want to pick you up, show you to the world and tell them that you're my life. These words can never compare to the feeling that I get when you come to my mind. <b>When you take me by the hand</b>, <b>you take me by the heart</b>. I love how we can both be there for each other and know that we won't let each other down. But tell me what am I suppose to do without you in my life? I'd be nothing. No one. I just love you so damn much. And I'm gonna tell you over and over again that I'm <b><u>never</b></u> leave you. Ever. You should know that by now. My heart will always be yours. Only Haley Austin Sitlers. And if I don't marry you, I'm marrying no one. Period. I can't wait until Saturday and in 4 more years. I love you. Know that and never forget it."

I've realized that a lot of things I do, aren't reconized. I'm starting to feel weak again. People don't notice that I try to help them and it's getting to me now. Me and my mother don't even get along. Well, rarely. One day, we can be like mother and son and the next day we can be enemies living under the same roof. It's heartbreaking. I want to tell her so many things to but I know how she reacts, I know how she takes things. 

I can't wait until I get out of here. Out of this house. My brother has been in jail for over a year for drugs and he gets out in about a month. Ugh. He acts like my father when he's only 25. He has a son of his own. He tells me what to do and you know what's sad? I am deathly scared of him. He's never done anything to me but the worse thing you can do to me is yell at me, if you're an adult. I hate getting yelled at. It makes me feel like I don't belong. I cry, mostly. My brother just puts me in a spot that I don't like to be in when he's around. He doesn't understand me. No one does. 

My brother has changed so much. I remember back in 97-98' we acted like unseperateable brothers. We were. We owned like 4 four-wheelers and we used to live by these woods and we'd take one of the four-wheelers and just ride and ride. We'd build dirt ramps together and ride four-wheelers at 2:30 in the morning. That was the life.

I'm scared that when he comes back, we won't reconize me. He won't reconize 'Kory bro' anymore. I just want to sit him down and talk to him like we use to but he has become more like my mom. My mom has always told me, ""Kory, I'm your best friend. We're best friends."" I've never told my mom anything. I just can't. I hold everything inside because I'm scared what she'd do to me if I told her things. Told her how I really feel inside. 

My sister on the other hand is too caught up with her drugs in West Palm Beach. She lives somewhere different like every 2 weeks because of her low life self. She doesn't keep her promises at all but she's the only one that knows <b>everything</b> about me. I still love her to death.

My mother expects a lot of me just because I'm the only child that came out anti-drug. My adoptive mom because as if you didn't know, my real mom is dead. She expects me to pull straight A's and compares me to her friends kids then makes me feel like shit. Doesn't every mom expect the best for their children? I mean, I don't blame her because I also want a future and all that nice stuff but it's <b>my</b> life. I'm sick of her living her high dreams into mine when I don't even have dreams.

I feel so alone. I mean, sure I have Haley but even she's far away from me. 115 miles away. Yeah, I don't need that either. She's the first person I'd have right now by my side but distance always ruins things. I'm scared of us falling apart because of it, too. I miss her so much. I just don't know anymore.

Everyone I need is far away. This is life. I'm on my own."

The clouds can fill the sky blank but it's you who will still be on my mind. You occupy this space in my heart that helps it keep beating. <b>You're something amazing</b>. You may not see how much you mean to me, but know you have a great big part of my heart. That part will soon reach to a you & me one day. When I close my eyes, you're the name I see in my sky. I'll always be right there, standing by your side."

Today Kelsea surprised me and came over to get me and we went to the pond and talked.
I haven't seen in her about 9-10 months & she lives in my neighborhood.
Haha, it's so sad. I missed that girl, a lot.

Me in the 1st one and Kelsea was bending over because she had ants on her feet. Haha.

I took the 1st one and Kelsea took the 2nd one. 
Sorry I look drunk in the 2nd one. Haha.

"event","""To love animals is more than giving them homes, or bigger cages..giving a few percentage of animals comfort and love IS NOT enough. BY stating the words ""I LOVE ANIMALS"" you are saying you will not support their TORTURE...in other words one will not EAT their dead corpse, buy products that were brutally tested on them, wear their once alive furs and skins, or get enjoyed out of their misery so you can be entertained...If you support any of those listed, please do not say YOU LOVE ANIMALS..please say ""i like certain animals and only care about the well being of some animals, others could suffer as long as it doesnt effect me""-ME"

The place i went to was nutss.... here read this...I hvae my own story but it will take WAY to long to write....so read this for now

""This is a truly scary twisted sick fucking thing that we have all been through. Anyone, who sits and reads the posts on this site will realized that we have so many different memories, and different stories. Some of us remember things so differently than others. The human mind can only take so much, and Elan has put my soul through a ringer. No one can be trusted. I have trusted many people that I have met on Elan Alum and in other elan forums. They are mostly sickened people. Ken is holding onto his shit by the skin of his teeth right now, and he will be exposed any day. I wish to hell we could all stop this crazyness. I just pray that the doors of Elan will one day close forever. I have this dream of wrecking balls crashing through the very rooms where I once stood in front of 50 screaming brainwashed children, all scared. Crashing through the walls of the rooms where I was blasted for things that I could not humanly control. I want to see the Baseball field and the soccer fields ripped apart, in memory of physically being pushed past the point where I could breath or even see. I dream about those hideous beds being thrown into a landfill so than no one will ever have to wake up with a sore neck and back day after day for 3 years, and function as COF or COD or SOF on no sleep. Spinning around in circles, functioning these pointless jobs, feeling ill from the disgusting food, feeling sick from the filthy air. Sitting so close to each other that you can feel breath all over you. The breath of the girl who just talked about raping her younger sister in womens issues. Wrecking balls bashing through the bathrooms where we repeatedly took 3 minute long freezing cold showers with no privacy or room to move. Breaking through the dorm walls where I once layed in bed crying and holding myslef for three hours because I was not allowed to simply urinate. Sitting in those dark rooms with the lights buzzing day in and day out. Listening to the stories of ruined souls, ruined lives. Corrupt staff treating us like we were Jews in the Holocaust. Staff being hired that sexually harrased me. I dream that elan will be shut down, broken down, discarded, and rid from this earth. Someday in the future no elan residents will exist, we will all have passed on and there will be nothing left at the end of that stomach turning winding road. Maybe a family will build a summer home down by the lake. And relax in front of the water. There will be no zones, no house line up, no headcounts. People should be treated like people. I was a fucking sardine for 3 years. If anyone can say that Elan is good, or right I cannot understand how we are the same species. Joe Ricci is dead. Now can't we let his hideous money making evil hearted scheme of a fascist boot camp be put to rest. I don't want to lose on more night of sleep thinking about the images that creeped out of the walls while i was forced to stare into a corner. Or How I conformed and yelled, I yelled soooo much. At people who never deserved it. We were at elan because we needed guidance. We needed love. We needed help. What we got is a very bleak future of rotten memories and feelings of worthlessness. The memories of Marc Rosenburg telling me I am nothing but a whore, how worthless I am, how no one will ever love me. How I am at the bottom of society, how the world doesn't need me. What a great man he was. A 15 year old girl should b=never hear that. The emotional abuse was too much for me, and I want so hard to let go. ""

""my name is jackie and i was a resident at ""elan school"" in poland springs, maine. i was there from september 1979-november of 1982. i went through months of living in corners in dissassociative states of mind, self-harm, extreme emotional and physical abuses. things from 30 people at a time screaming in my face and spitting on me to being placed in restraints, to being placed in the boxing ring to fight with/against other peers as disciplinary measures.i went through extreme humiliation and degradation.my story begins at the age of thirteen. i am diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, narrcissitic personality disorder, anti-social personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder with psychotic features, and dissassociative identity disorder, also with severe major depressive disorder. i am 37 years old and there is rarely a day that goes by that i dont have flashbacks or go through some kind of emotional turmoil due to the abuses i suffered during my stay in the ""program"". it is my hope that this site will help bring closure not only to myself, but to others as well. you can contact me on the message board. thanks to all who come in here and i hope you find what you are looking for."

"event","This is a basic continuation to my last entry, now to find a starting point of this never ending bull shit i am faced with. I am simply a complainer but I cant help these emotions that make me function incorrectly, I need 2 collect myself and by writing I can look feel more relieved. my computer crashed the other day adn EVERYTHING got erased! I was so upset, all my music, my videos, my irreplacible pictures and of course my pictures and poems of the precious Bernie :(. IM really upset and to make it worse my dad screamed at me so much. I had to re-install windows and eveyrthing it took hours. Theres so much tension in my house I cant stand it my dad makes me want 2 kill myself all the time. THeres alot of emotional damage that my dad has done to me and i havent told my mom because it wont fix anything and she doesnt understand. WHne my dad gets up in my face i like start 2 shake and i get so angry and depressed..His voice pisses me off, his prescence and evyerhting.>>He gives me nightmares. MY mom hates him also she is just staying with him because she doesnt want to have 2 deal with fighting to support herself. My dads a greedy angry abusive asshole and i cant take it anymore. Yesturday my parents started fighting because the phone rang at 1 and woke them up and the sound of his voice made me want 2 smash my head thru a wall and tehn he comes in my room to yell at me and GETS IN MY FACE! i was so mad that i needed 2 calm down b4 i did something stupid so i ran out and my mom tried 2 stop me but i ran out teh garage and down the street in a shirt and sandles as fast as i can. I finally had 2 come home, but i came so close to doing some stupid shit. I slept in the driveway in the rain and then around 5 slept in my momds car. My dad was going 2 work and  he saw me and yelled at me. Then my mom let me in but i havent gone back 2 bed yet im 2 depressed. Theres so much other stuff but I cant explain it becauses its too complicated. BAH!!!

I also wish i had a close friend who was intense with animal rights and politics. THis kid evan i met is like that but i feel weird calling him up to cry about my weird logic, idk. Hed def. go to protests with me tho, but i kinda want a girl friend to do it wth me. Idk err it sux...

My parents are fucking assholes to me, especially my dad thery deprive me of things because my dad wont let my mom get my anything. How fucking ridiculous is that?!!? my dads a fucking control freak and he like controls my mom and i cant stand it. He wont let me get a new cell phone even tho IM PAYING FOR IT! he pays the fucking monthly bill since im on a 2 year contract so why not fucking get me a cell phone? and they always yell at me for not calling when i dont HVAE A PHONE TO CALL ON! I am going 2 pay someone 2 kill my dad i hate him so much!!! I also fucked things up with CHris because im a heartless miserable bitch as he said to me and hes right! I messed everything up and i didnt care at teh time but now i miss him but w/e. hes done so mch for me and all i did was hurt him, im such a horrible person. I just want 2 die right now, i feel so fat adn gross and worthless. Im so lonely, i need affection and to feel prized and noticed. Im so lost in my mind and im drowning in my feeling of unwanted and unappreciated that i dont know how much more i can take. I wish i ahd a car, i would be able to drive and feel in control thats teh feeling im lacking is the ability to feel like i have teh handle on my life. I want 2 be normal and think like a normal person and not get so depressed and fucked up all the time. My fucking mind is an impulsive, reckless, locked trap and i wont get out of in time to save my self from myself. I want to be understood and especially with animal rights i wish people would agree! WHy would anyone argue that fact that its ok for animals to suffer? Since when is purposely inflicted torment and hurting to innocent/ remote creatures who ask nothing of us deserve this? Im sorry i dont understand the right and suitable outlook on this, when something cries they feel pain and when i see an animal crying with there helpless eyes staring at me its just such a strong emotional drag to help them. I cant deal with it, i cant watch them suffer its so hard because they didnt do anything to deserve this. The only crime they can EVER be accounted for is the inability to say the word ""help."" Life sux! I want to die and hvae my spirit come back 2 liberate all teh animals. Life is too unfair and i speak for many....fuck!"

Well..on Saturday i got into a really big fight wtih my dad and Danielle and me decided we were going 2 leave so we did. MY friend picked us up and we stayed at his house and teh next day him and his friend rented us a hotel :). That was fun hehhee, he gave us money to go shoppping and stuff it was awesome. After 3 days our parents said if we came home they would be calm and shit and not call the cops so we went home and it was hell.

So the next day my mom wouldnt let me out again and i was like flipping so finally she did and said i had to be home b4 12..WEll nadia picked me up adn we met up with these 2 guys Drew and Brian because i wanted nadia 2 meet this kid hoping she would like him. SHe had to leave tho because her mom wanted her home and i stayed with them. THen we hung out and wahtever and i was being such a bitch hehe, then we poicked up my Spice and BIll and theyw were driving me home and we picked up danielle. WEll me and danielle were being SUCH demadning bitches and like making fun of them and we made them take us to 7 11 to buy us a slurpee. SO tehy are like telling us 2 chill out and like getting fed up with us nbecause we were taking our bad mooods out on them. SO the slurpee machines didnt work and we screamed at them calling them bad luck. SO we got coffee and Spice was online and we walked out of the store and go to the cashier ""Hes paying"" and leave. AND Spice would not pay adn he thouht that was so fukced up of us,but we were kidding around the whole time. SO we go inside to pay and then leave us there. SO me and daanielle are laughing thinking they are going 2 come back adn they dont. So an hour goes by and were just sitting there like fuck..SO we called the cops to come get us and they called our parents and we didnt get home until 4 and were both in alot of trouble. Oh man! this otehr cop came and yelled at us for laughing about the situation oooo man. hahaa...i think?

I want coffee my mom i think is going 2 let me out but idk she was mad about having to come out at 3 to pick me up and such...I dont blame her..but i want coffee!!!

Today at the vet they gave us bernies ashes :(..O man my heart sank jsut thinking that she was once a live cat now shes ashes. I still cry, i miss her so much!!! I feel so empty and emotionally torn idk how to deal with this pain. Me and my mom might join this class for people dealing with the emotionals of a lost pet. I think i need that because i cant bare this....I MISS MY BERNIE!!!! :(

<i>Ha la la la la bomba dear this is the pilot speaking
And I've got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do
Oh sure the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
Yes, my cup shall always be full 

Oh I like coffee
And I like tea
I'd like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well all right okay
So be that way
I hope and pray
That there's something left to say"

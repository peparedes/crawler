"event","This has been a long time coming.&nbsp; At the beginning of June I moved to Florida to be with Tricia. The plan was to live with her family until I found a place to stay and a job to support me. On the trip down, I received a call from an apartment place, and told them i was on my way. I also had made several attempts at securing a job before I came.&nbsp; Well as it turns out, I got the apartment, but couldn't move in for a month. I was worried I was imposing on Tricia's family, but they were very understanding and gladly let me stay for an extended period, about five weeks it ended up being. I searched high and low for a job.&nbsp; Before I came down i was certain it would take me no time at all to find a job, online there were over 3000 jobs listed seemingly begging for workers. I signed up with a temp service and searched through multiple online sites and did some old fashioned door to door advertising of myself.&nbsp; Well I had 3 interviews, the first didn't pan out, working for tropicana. The next was to work for a department store, the Florida equivalent of Macy's, Dillards.&nbsp; That didn't go well.&nbsp; The next i was really excited about, it was to work for a small company in which i was accostomed to working with the programs they used to purchase things as well as it was paying about $12.00 an hour, forty hours a week.&nbsp; I had two seperate interviews both of which lasted an extended amount of time.&nbsp; I was told to wait a week, and he would get back to me.&nbsp; As it turns out, he didn't have the budget to hire me.&nbsp; At this time I had put my resume in everywhere and was frankly burned out, i sent over 200 resumes online to assorted employers with rarely a reply. I was pretty worried. At last I was told about an opening at a pool store, where a friend of tricia's&nbsp; worked and was leaving.&nbsp; I was hired there for about $8 an hour and only like 32 hours a week. The good part is, it will cover my expenses, the bad part it really doesn't leave much room for anything else. I have other things I had wanted to pay off and really won't be able to now. Tricia goes back to school at the end of August and I have tuesdays and thursdays off and will go with her to tampa, an hour away and probably go to the library a lot and what not.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of all the worry of not finding a job and what not, I have been having an amazing time.&nbsp; Being with the person you can't be without is more exciting than anything i've ever experienced.&nbsp; Especially when we had seen each other 3 times prior, for a week at a time.&nbsp; The rest of the time we were forced to endure the phone and toward the end the web cam. It was never easy, there were times when it was ok, but the situation had to be rremedied and it was. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best part of being with someone you love is being loved in return, especially when it is equal, when both parties are on the perverbial same page. The best part of Tricia and I is that when i tell her I love her, she knows i mean it and vice versa, that she knows exactly what I am thinking when i say it, and knows how i am feeling in that instance. For this I am truely glad, i have never in any previous relationship experienced that, to my knowledge, I was always the one that wanted a little more out of the relationship and put more into it than the other person. In our case it is an equal share, not only that, but we both know what we want from each other, that being, to be together forever. I can say this for a certainty and it's an amazing feeling to posses such knowledge, that another being wants you and you alone, for the rest of their life. I have never felt it before. And although we go through fights and arguments, and there are things about each other we might not care for, we know this is apart of the other person and will take the good with the bad.&nbsp; I can share my deepest desires, thoughts and feelings with her, and she can with me, this is part of our bond, the comfortable soul latches onto it's counterpart, always thinking it is seeing it's reflection, but yet another soul posseses the same qualities and will never want to part once they become close. No one has ever cared for me like she does, and no one ever will.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been to Disney quite a few times, Busch Gardens once or twice. I am about 10 mins away from the Ocean, which is amazing. The dollar theatre here is good, we usually go two or three times a month. Harry Potter came out and I read that, I am reading some other books lately too.&nbsp; We saw The Goo Goo Dolls last weekend, they were really good.&nbsp; Then last tuesday we saw John Mayer, who was really good, and Ben Folds played before him, who i was really really excited for. He never plays ""Brick"" live very often, and he did at our concert, and it was incredible, it is one of my favorite 90's songs. Other than that i have just been enjoying every day with Tricia, cause we get to see each other every day now, and I wouldn't give it up, and won't have to, ever.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's been hard to keep up with everyone, and for that I apologize, you are still in my everyday thoughts. Right now I am doing well, and will update everyone again when something happens."

"event","Again for the second night in a row, I have tried to kill the monster from the windows 95 game ""Ski Free"".

I walk from my grandmothers kitchen and her eating area becomes a beach, with mountains behind them, and I am walking with tricia and ski free monster comes up from behind, and I just try and protect her, I'm throwing high kicks, and then start stabbing at him with an ink pen, while telling her to run.&nbsp; I then start to try and create a ball of energy (presumably like the show ""Dragonball Z""), but cannot, and am soon overwhelmed by the monster.&nbsp; He soon starts chasing after tricia, and I become enraged and chase after him and trip him, and then I pick up tricia and carry her up the mountain.

This dream seems to have been the result of not defeating the ski free monster the first night.&nbsp; I hope the dream continues tonight, because I am going to think of a way&nbsp; all day to kill him."

"event","I pulled an all-nighter for the first time this semester because I am retarded.&nbsp; I have an independent study course which I have thus far neglected and now, it's not so neglected, but my sleep is.

I've been watching the 4th season of Dawson's Creek, go ahead and make fun of me, I don't care.&nbsp; 

Today, I was at work, and this lady came in without a coat on, a complete moron, and complained about how she is getting sick, gee, I wonder why.

I'm going to Flordia March 6th to visit my girlfriend.&nbsp; I couldn't be more excited.

I've been up for 24 hours, seriously.&nbsp; I'm going to try to get a couple hours sleep."

"event","<font size=""2"">I haven't had a real post in a while, so I'll give you what no one's been waiting for.&nbsp; I think I just had the best semester ever, in terms of grades(all A's(knock on wood)) and in what I learned.&nbsp; I learned more in my graphic design class and my world politics class than all my other classes combined, ever.&nbsp; I was however, consistently busy.&nbsp; Almost to the point of losing it a couple of times, but it never happened. I had two ten page papers due on the same day, and I got them back today, A's on both of them, but one of them, for my world politics class, was a 100%, that more than anything makes me really proud of myself.<br /><br />My last day in graphic design the printer wouldn't print, so I was going to honestly punch it, but I got a really dirty look from this girl I know, and later she said she has never seen me that mad.&nbsp; This from a girl that says me, more than anyone else, doesn't give a shit about anything, a total disregard for order, authority, and I don't let anyone get away with being stupid.&nbsp; I frankly don't agree, I mean, if someone is talking and all that is coming out is nonsense, i'll speak up and tell them, but I can be pretty lazy, and when everyone is complaining about some homework assignment we got, I am not going to go crazy, it's our assignment, what can you do.&nbsp; Also I guess I do pretty much whatever I want in classes, and for the most part I ask what everyone else is thinking, but won't ask.&nbsp; One time we were supposed to get into groups and I just didn't go into mine, i went to lunch, for like an hour, people still talk about that in my ceramics class.  <br /><br />I worked on a Mac all semester, and loved them so much I am getting one, an iMac.&nbsp; My laptop has slowly deteriorated, even my external hard drive puked, with everything I've ever done with a computer on it.&nbsp; This includes all school work i.e. papers, all art projects, all my music - 20GB - a good amount, hardly any of which is backed up on CDs, and every picture i've ever taken.&nbsp; My keyboard is extremely annoying, since getting a new one last semester, this ""new"" one has a few glitches - Its favorite thing to do is; when you press a key, it types two for you, sweet - then sometimes, it just doesn't type anything, or will mysteriously take scroll lock off.&nbsp; I guess I still like my mouse and speakers.&nbsp; Without my external hard drive, I only have 5GB of space, try doing anything.<br /><br />Every weekend just about, Pat, Aaron and myself, wrestle in the Judo room at SVSU.&nbsp; Actually I suppose you could call it Brazillian Ju-Jitsu, but I usually refrain from calling it that, I don't know why, but more than anything it's submission wrestling.&nbsp; I can say on our own, we have improved dramatically.&nbsp; It's even rare that we tap each other out now, it's a lot of draws.&nbsp; I haven't arm-barred someone in a while.&nbsp; I have thoroughly enjoyed this, and have learned quite a bit, while becoming increasingly flexible as well.&nbsp; I'm not in the best shape still, but I think I am getting there.<br /><br />I have been dressing better on purpose, I don't really know for sure why, but I guess I'd rather look really good everyday wearing a jacket and jeans or dress pants, than some t-shirt.&nbsp; I'm not going to buy anymore t-shirts, I don't want to know how much I've spent over the years on stupid t-shirts.&nbsp; Last year I showed up to an event for the newspaper where everyone was in a suit and I was in t-shirt and jeans, and I felt like crap, so I'll never be caught in that position again, and have decided that no matter what the occasion I would much rather be overdressed than under dressed.&nbsp; Why does spell check say overdressed is one word while under dressed is two? Someone is an idiot.<br /><br />I don't know what was going on for a while, for about a month, from before thanksgiving, till actually about a week ago, everything seemed really boring to me, I guess i was stuck in a rut.&nbsp; The thing is it wasn't from lack of things to do, maybe a lack of excitement, but the things that were usually fun didn't seem that fun anymore.&nbsp; I don't know if it was some sort of maturation process, but really weird I can't figure it out.&nbsp; I know money isn't the root of fun right, but every time things are getting tight, I really start to worry and I secretly start acting really weird, am moody, and am easily angered.&nbsp; I'll be ok now I made it to break, with a couple hundred to spare, but last year at this time I was doing much better.&nbsp; I had to get a credit card for Christmas gifts, so not everything I gave was homemade.<br /><br />So I guess for fear of jinxing it or something, I haven't said anything about a certain person.&nbsp; Usually, when someone posts something like this they start by ""I met someone"".&nbsp; Well I can't exactly say that, haha.&nbsp; I guess I'm that kid.&nbsp; So basically in the midst of October my good friend Caitlin says her good friend Tricia is going to message me.&nbsp; So i get this message, and we send back and forth for a while.&nbsp; Well it ends up that we start sending longer and longer messages, like in the neighborhood of 2000-3000 words toward the end. So we finally start talking on aim, and then on the phone, for extended periods of time.&nbsp; At this point we talk for another week or so, and frankly decide we like each other, without having met one another.&nbsp; So now its been a couple months and i'm going to be meeting her(Tricia) the 28th.&nbsp; So the ""catch"" if you will, or reason we have not met each other before now, is that she lives in Florida and I of course live in Michigan.&nbsp; So we'll see what happens, as much as I would like it to work, or think it will work, I am realistic, in the sense that it is going to be difficult to say the least, and also because I have never met this person, which doesn't scare me as much as it makes me uncertain.&nbsp; Pat, Alex and I came up with an idea, which is really funny, that instead of me going to meet her, it would be Alex, and just before I went down, I would start posting ""new"" pictures of myself, which would be pictures of Alex.&nbsp; I can't imagine really doing that, but it was such a great idea, I thought I would throw it in, also Tricia, i think I told you that story, if not, chalk another one up to me being weird.<br /><br />To me it was an ok year in the music world, most of the time I spend looking up music, it's not new stuff.&nbsp; This is/was the new stuff that I liked in order.&nbsp; I could post my most listened to music of the year had my hard drive not died. Also, to be on this list, I would have obviously had to of listened to it,&nbsp; but more importantly liked it.<br /><br /></font><b><font size=""2"">Brand New - ""The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me""<br /></font></b><font size=""2"">I've only had this album about a week, and I really really like it, and I can say it is probably my favorite this year<br /><b>The Shins - ""Wincing the Night Away""</b></font><br /><font size=""2"">This album technically doesn't come out until next year, but i've had it for about a month and it's really weird and I like it a lot.<br /></font><b><font size=""2"">The Decemberists - ""The Crane Wife""<br /></font></b><font size=""2"">This might be their best album, its really good, and I can't describe music as anything else but good it seems. I'm retarded.<br /></font><b><font size=""2"">Agalloch - ""Ashes Against The Grain""<br /></font></b><font size=""2"">For my introduction into this band, it was a fantastic introduction, I have recently attempted to delve into past recordings.<br /></font><font size=""2""><b>Dashboard Confessional - ""Dusk and Summer""<br /></b>More solid material, not the best but I still like it.<br /></font><b><font size=""2"">Justin Timberlake - ""FutureSex/LoveSounds""<br /></font></b><font size=""2"">I actually got into this album quite a bit, talk about catchy, it's good.<br /></font><font size=""2""><b>Sufjan Stevens - ""The Avalanche""</b> <br />Which technically counts even though it's really the leftovers from the ""Illinoise"" album<br /><b>John Mayer - ""Continuum""</b><br />I still have to give this a few more listens, but I like what I hear, very adult contemporary.<br /><br />Movies, nuff said. Also, like music, I would have not only had to have seen it, but also liked it. Also, I'm not commenting on all of these, order should be enough to keep everyone happy, actually i hope it pisses someone off.<br /><br /></font><ol><li><b><font size=""2"">The Departed</font></b></li><li><b><font size=""2"">Little Miss Sunshine</font></b></li><li><b><font size=""2"">Casino Royal</font></b></li><li><b><font size=""2"">Clerks II</font></b></li></ol><font size=""2"">The rest of these I liked for some reason or another.&nbsp; I guess it's probably bad I only really liked 4 movies this year.<br />Firewall<br />Running scared<br />V for Vendetta<br />United 93<br />The Davinci Code<br />The Omen<br />The Descent<br />Jackass II<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></font><br /><br /><br />"

"event","10 Things I'm thankful for - 10 things I'm not happy about.

in short-

NOT
10. Hassles in general.

9. Some social situations, I am still inept at dealing with.

8. Driving to work and hitting every single damn light.

7. Jesswire's inconsitancy lately. 

6. Work

5. How much money I spend on sustaning myself, i.e. food.

4. I still think about my old truck.

3. This summer i have to take my first summer class, and it is going to suck, but its the only one of that class offered, ever, in the summer only.  It will be three days a week, starting in July till end of august.  If anything, that class will ruin my finances, and my psyche.

2. Some people drive me crazy, to an absolute rage, pure stupidity on the part of another human is becoming my biggest pet peeve, second only to a scratched CD.

1. My external hard drive on my computer quit, and that had everything essential to my existence on a computer.  It had all my music, all my graphic design projects, just loads of stuff, days and months of work, poof, gone.

------------------------------------------

Good
10. Thanksgiving without being bombarded too much by christmas.

9.  This semester, while being fairly difficult, has been my favorite as far as school goes, I don't want to jinx it, but I may pull off something I have never done in college before (All A's)..

8.  Vanguard has been pretty solid this year, in terms of new responsibilities, but more along the lines of friendships and what the future holds.

7.  My truck has been good to me so far, besides one flat tire.

6.  I like my apartment, it has a some things about it that are so much better.

5.  My graphic design classes are superb.

4. Learing to curb my reations to things, not overreating about things in general, must have been the anger management.

3. Wrestling every sunday.

2. Family, very thankful, not only for the help I recieve, but for the things I have been aforded thus far, including the knowledge I gained by having good parents that kept me in line, and a hard dad.

1. Friends, honestly I don't nearly show my appreciation enough, for everything.  No one will ever know, because I will probably never tell you to your face, because some things are better left unsaid.  Also I have a new friend in particular, that is worth mentioning. I think it's going really well with this person given the circumstances, and come the end of december, I may just have something better to put in here, something not so complicated."

"event","I had a really good poem to post, but then I forgot the author and can't find it by searching the lines.  It pertained to death, explained it, metephorically.  My grandma passed away, I wasn't close to her at all, my mom's family and ours never have been very close.  I really didn't know how to feel, I hadn't seen her since I was a kid, partly because, she may or may not have wanted anything to do with me or my brothers. Irregardless, I don't feel bad she died, it was her time, she was really sick apperantly.  The only time I felt something was when my mom started crying, neither of her parents are alive now.  The only other time, was when I thought about other deaths that have occured, and have been really hard.  I heard Sufjan Steven's ""Casmir pulanski day"", there is some things in that song, that make it incredibly sad to me.  

It makes me think of my own death, not the actual dying part, or the wanting to see what happens part, but the ""what song would I have played"", or the how many people would show up.

<h3>This makes me more sad than anything</h3>
My old truck seen in this picture is dead.  It was being completely restored, more than all the work I put into it.  My brother was going to get it after me.  The shop it was in, being worked on, burnt to the ground. It almost made me cry, not even joking.
This is the only picture i could find of my old truck.

"event","Craziest storm I have ever been apart of, it was so loud all night, I really just couldn't sleep, I had to close my window, and it was hot.  Insane drive to work this morning, people actually lose their minds if there is any water in the road, like swerve in your lane and go 15 in the middle of the road.

Before the storm, last night I took pictures around SVSU, for a project, some of them are kinda blurry, but they will work for what I need them for.

"event","So this morning while driving from saginaw to millington, to work, I was like 500 feet from work, when my tire blew out.  I pulled into the driveway barely.  I got out, looked at it, and walked into work, punched in, sat down, turned on my computer, shot the breeze for awhile, and then quietly got up and went outside to change my tire.  I couldn't get the lugnuts off, so I went in and got a big pipe, and used it for more leverage on the lugnut wrench... It starts to rain...  I couldn't get the jack out from behind my seat cause it was screwed in, so I got a screwdriver.....  It starts raining harder....  The jack looked like it came out of a cereal box.  Once I jacked it up, I tried, and tried, and tried to get my spare tire out from underneath the truck.  There is thing where you put your key into, turn and pull,  got that out, then you have to insert two long square pipes and twist.  Well this wasn't twisting, because you are supposed to use the lugnut wrench, but that was broken(not by me), so I had to get a socket, finally came loose.  Lowered that down, had to crawl in the puddles to get the tire off the wench....rains even harder... Put the spare on.  My other tire has a 4"" slice in it, presumably on my best guess from something on the railroad tracks.  I threw that in the back, cleaned up the tools, wiped them off, wrung my shirt out, parked my truck and went back and sat down.  

Usually when I write one of these ""what went wrong"" entries, I am very angry at the circumstances.  For some reason today, and probably for the first time in my entire life, I didn't get mad one time, and especially when it started raining harder and harder, I really just started laughing, and not the ""I'm so mad i'll laugh/cry"", it was a genuine laugh.  The whole situation, while annoying, won't ruin my day today, I don't know why.  Strike it up to growing up, or whatever, i don't have a clue, but I spent an hour and a half changing a tire and at every point it fought me, and I took it on the chin without blinking.  This actually makes me more pleased.  I know it's going to be expensive for a brand new truck tire, and then mounting it, but whatever.  Actually the best part was I walked into my dad's office, ""So, I got a flat tire this morning"", and he goes, ""Well that's life"" and instead of my usual tirade at an adults attempt at mitigated justification using that principle, I go, ""yeah, yeah it is"""

"event","So, it's official... I am an asshole.

Today, went to go eat in Millington.  There was absolutely no where to park.  So I was with my co-worker we see this empty drive-way that is like in between houses, unoccupied, you really couldn't tell if it was a drive-way or just a cement pad, so I parked there.  Well we go eat, and we are walking back,  and from a distance I see a sign on my tailgate.  Then I see a lady in a wheel chair sitting there, like she was waiting.  Man, I already know what's coming, so we are kinda hiding behind this tree, and she starts her way up her wheel chair ramp on her house, so we are going to go over there when she makes it up.  Then she just sits at the top and is watching us.  So I give up and start walking over, and right away ...

Wheelchair lady: ""This yer truck""
Me: ""Yeah, we're really sorry, we thought....""
WL: ""WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO PARK IN MY DRIVEWAY, WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE""
Me: ""Well see the thing is, bob told us to park here, he said....
WL: ""WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!!!!!""
Me; ""Yeah bob though, he definitaly said this spot was ours, he said park here""
WL: ""I DON'T KNOW ANY BOB'S, AND IF SOME SON OF A BITCH TOLD YOU TO PARK HERE, HE'LL GET HIS""
Me:  "" Ok, yeah we are gonna take off, really sorry, really (laughing hysterically)""
WL:  ""GET OUT OF HERE, YOU'RE LUCKY I DIDN'T DO MY USUAL AND HAVE YER ASS TOWED, GET OUT OF HERE, IF I SEE YOU OR BOB, YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM THE AUTHORITIES""
Me:  ""CHECK YA LATER!!!!"" (PEEL OUT)(HONK HORN)

In addition to the sign that read : ""who do you think you are to park in my yard"", she also wrote on my window with soap ""PRIVATE DRIVE""

I am pretty sure she hates her life, we didn't block her in or anything, she just freaked, and I don't feel bad about it at all, we really didn't do anything wrong, she just got pissed.  I don't know any bob's either, but better watch out anyway.


<b>Part II.</b>

The other night, Pat, alex, aaron and I were walking out of the mall, and to my dismay on my right is a limo with about 12 kids standing next to it, slowly getting in, guys on one side, girls on the other.  So I yell, ""What in the F***"", not really looking over there.  As we are walking away from them, a high school age kid, says something to the effect of ""oh yeah baby, that's right"" and I laugh and keep walking.  Then they are pointing and laughing kinda, and I am watching them, so I have a cup full of ice, and I chuck it a them, almost hit them.  We continue walking, and finally a kid goes ""HEY, you got a problem""  I stop and turn around, and start walking back toward them, and the I go ""NO, why do you?"" and the kid kinda looks around and goes, ""No, no man"", and I say something like, ""yeah that's right""  So then I stare for a minute, and they are trying to get in the limo still, and they finally get in and yell something out of the door, and by that time I am pretty much laughing, while everyone else is waiting for me in the car, pretty funny, I kinda wish a couple of them would have tried to fight me or something, even though, it wouldn't be that good of a fight, just me stomping their face."

"event","Today at work something happened for the second or third time.  It's really weird.  I mean I know it's probably just coincidence.  I'll be listening to music and I'll be finished with an album, so I usually put it on shuffle, then if I hear something I like then I can go to that album and listen to it.  But this is what happens, i'll have something in mind, a song, but since I was already going to put in on shuffle I will just do that, well, once again, the song I was thinking of, was the song that played first when I push play on shuffle.  

Also, nothing to do with the first part, but a couple of weeks ago, there was a news story about a kid who had memories of being a WWII pilot.  Now at first, I was really really skeptical.  Then I looked at some of the research that was done on it, and it was actually really scary/crazy.  The kid, who was all of like 3, would tell stories about flying, talk about his partner in the cockpit, talk about friends in the military, all of these explicit details.  Well the names and associations he rattled off were dead on.  He even told about how he died ect.  Now I don't believe in reincarnation or anything like that, so this really blew me away, I actually have no good explanation for it, and it bothers me.

"event","Ten good things, possibly not in order

1.  I helped buy a new truck last week.  When I say helped, I mean my parents paid for most of it.  My old truck goes to my younger brother.  While I really appreciate this more than anyone can imagine, I feel like I don't deserve it.  It's a standard red truck, my third red truck, I've had an '87, 91' and now a 2000.

2.  Summer brings limited responsibility.  Not having to worry about school lets you think about other things.  Unlike some, I have a very low stress job, even tho, today, I had to answer phones while everyone else was in a meeting, a lot of transfering people to voicemail.  In addition to that, I have more work attatched to my job now, not really a problem.

3.  It's my birthday soon

4.  I will live in a better place next year, with good people.

5.  Living at home provides a plethera of food, and you can't beat free.

6.  I decided that two of the top ten best days of my life happened in 2005.

7.  I can grow a big beard.

8.  I have gone through school so far by trying at about 65%, so I figure if I bump it up then I will have a 3.2 for graduation, thats good enough for me.

9.  Soulseek

10.  ""In the Backround"" by Third Eye Blind


Ten Bad things

1.  I don't really excel at anything.  I am good at a lot of things, but I don't really have an identity as a person because I am so fickle.  I am not into one thing 100%, and while there are some that would find that to be an admiral trait, most of the time I think it's a burden.

2.  For some reason I chew on the ends of all my pens at work, so my desk at work looks like a kindergartener's.

3.  I am very lazy, I am unmotivated and get discouraged when there is something that I could have worked at but didn't, and because I didn't, it sucks.

4.  I procrastinate everything.

5.  I am usually late to everything.

6.  I can usually intrepret people's behavior, people's thoughts, guess what people are thinking, except I usually look right past myself.

7.  I never have enough time or money to do what I would really like to do.

8.  This summer, I haven't done any of the things on this list I have .

9.  I am not very nice sometimes.

10. I used to be someone that had everything planned out, now I don't know what is going to happen in regards to the future."

"event","Last night on the way home from hanging out with steve, carrie, gracie, I was sitting in the backseat of carrie's car ""Hey a deer"", ""deer"", ""oh fudge, a deer, shit""

First time I have ever been in a car where it has struck a deer. Carrie, gracie and I all yelling and I get out, not much damage, carrie's car is a tank.  The deer literally flew 50 feet down the road, flipping over landing on the side of the road, poor guy was toast.  I still can't belive that, instantaneous.  Also we had contemplated going a different way, but then kept going.

Well if that wasn't enough excitement I didnt take my keys when I left so I get home and I am locked out.  So I have my garage door opener.  I get in there and get the keys, except the keys are all there except for the house key.  So I go to the shed, no key there, try all the doors, no way in, so I slept in the back of my truck all night. Terrific."

"event","Soho(soccer-hockey) is a game I made up a long time ago, another one to beat my brothers at on a saturday, get in trouble for not letting them win once in a while, and end up quitting because everyone got pissed.  However this weekend it was reintroduced, so I made up some rules.  

<b>Soho basics</b>

Using hockey sticks and their feet, two teams hit and dribble a ball down the field and try to shoot it past a goalkeeper into a goal cage. Goals are scored just like in hockey and soccer, when the goalie is being stupid and it gets past them, or when someone is really good, and puts some mustard on their shot.

The team with the most goals at the end of the game is declared the winner.

<b>The Game</b>
      *Three periods 15 min each

      *5 players per side, plus a goalie

        Two umpires on the field officiate the match. An additional umpire may sit at the scorer's table.

      The ball must be passed or dribbled down the field with either your foot or the stick that you are hanging on to.  However, you cannot kick in a goal, you must shoot with the aforementioned stick
    
      *If the ball is in the air, you can catch it, but must release it to the ground.

<b>The Equipment</b>
    *
      <b>The Field</b>
      The field, or pitch, is 120 feet long and 60 feet wide divided by a center line. Faceoff circles are placed on either side of each net approx halfway between the goal and the center line.  This is usually played on grass, however a smaller version may be played indoors on a basketball court where you have rules much like basketball and have to take the ball back.

      <b>The Stick</b>
      It's a hockey stick.
       
      <b>The Ball</b>
      The ball, larger than a baseball, more resembles a mini-basketball.  It has to be light enough without being too light.  Made of rubber, not like a basketball, not like a 4 square ball, more like a kids plastic basketball, we'll see.
           *
      <b>The Goals</b>
      Goal cages 5 foot high, by 8 foot wide.

 <b>Extra Time/Overtime</b>
    *
    If a tie occurs at the end of regulation, there will be a 5 min overtime, in which if another tie occurs at the end of this, a shootout will happen.  This shootout will be 5 players, on the field at the time of the end of the overtime, each will get a chance to be one on one with the goalie, at the end there is a clear winner, if a tie at the end of the 5 man round occurs, then we will go to sudden death

<b>Fouls</b>
A player may not

    * Play the ball with his hands, to either pass or move forward.
    * Charge, shove or trip an opponent
    * Play the ball in a potentially dangerous way.
    * Use the foot or leg to step on another players stick
    * Raise the stick in a dangerous or intimidating manner while approaching, attempting to play or stop the ball
    * hook, hold or interfere with an opponents stick

<b>Free shot</b>

    * A free shot is awarded to the non-offending side following an infraction and are usually taken at the spot the foul occurs.
    * No player of the opposing team may be within 10 feet of the ball when hit.
    * The ball must be stationary and the striker must kick or hit it. The player may not replay the ball until another player has touched it.

Other rules will shadow soccer and hockey accordingly.  When playing, rules may be made up to appease crybabies.  Fighting is allowed.  No facemasks shall be worn.  Leg guards, gloves and wrist pads may be worn.  

<b>Out of bounds</b>

      *boundries shall be marked, when the ball goes out, the opposing team can kick it or hit it in bounds with a stick, from the spot where it went out.  if the ball goes out behind the goal by the defending team a corner kick/hit will occur.  If by the offense a goal kick/hit/throw will result.

Illegal immigration is a problem.  There are no current ideas that promote a situation wherein, this will not be a problem anymore.

well full time anyway, cause school has been work enough.  So now it's time to sit in a cubicle all day, 5 days a week.  Last night I get home, and its time to move the refrigerator out to the barn, and move the new heavy roll of carpet in the new family room, and then clean the barn.  Welcome home.

Then I watch the wings lose once again, well not really watch cause I was not going to sit thru that again.  Right now in my room, where in a weeks time, I am supposed to be moving back into, there is no room to walk. Evidently it has become the new garage, a catch all for the family, if it doesnt fit in your room, put it in nick's room.  I am sure I am going to have to move everything myself, of course I could always sleep on the old dining room table, I'd have plenty of room for friends, there are about 5 chairs in there, none belong to the table.

Is it just me, or did gobstoppers get smaller, serioulsy, I remember them being a lot bigger."

This seems to be pretty correct
#1. I am quiet at first, until you get to know me or vice versa, as everyone well enough knows.
#2. I have been accused of not giving a shit sometimes, and for the most part that is true, however, however much i procrastinate, i always get things done.
#3. Right on, I usually have to argue if I dont like what I hear, however there are exceptions to this, I wont argue if I dont know the subject very well that is being argued, and sometimes I will agree just to shut someone up.
#4. I am a reasonable person most of the time.
#5. Thats pretty close, I do like weird things sometimes, and I usually like new things as well, I suppose they are right about the moral aspect.

P.S. last day of school tomorrow, and I couldnt be happier."

"event","I can't believe it is almost over with, school that is, I actually dont know what happened to this year, it have flew by so fast, and it has been a bitter mistress at times, but it has been pretty sweet overall.

At the end of this week, and especially about next wednesday, sparks the beggining of, one of, the best parts of the whole year.

Schools out for summer
It's nice out
<b>H O C K E Y   P L A Y O F F S</B> 
AND basketball not far behind

The tigers have already started, and I am excited by the prospect of this season, not that my expectations are really that high, for the next few years it is increasingly so, but nevertheless, excited.

and as spring progresses, I can already feel like we are on the cusp of summer, the absolute best time of year.


I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed---and gazed---but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.

"event","Last week I went to a concert in Grand Rapids with my little brother, his first.  
Cartel (The best performance of the night, sounded good, played 8 songs, just really really good)
Copeland (only played 4 or 5 songs, not very good, very dissapointing)
Gatsbys American Dream (There is something to be said for bands that have idiot fans, this band had the worst fans there, they all came out of the woodwork at the show, not very good anyway)
The Starting Line(We left before it was over, but the most pro, and quality sound ect)
Like Lions (Pretty Good, I will look into them)

Overall : 6.5 out of 10


Afterward we met some people.  Picked up Krissy at Calvin.  Went to Katy's, drove to a place.  Met my brothers good friends, Jaime Worth and Leah Burns.  We were placed in a room where it was some girls 21st birthday, free entertainment, not to mention the drunk karaoke in the other room.  Very good to catch up and share stories while eating good food.  Had a very nice time.  Apparently my little brother has grown because jaime and leah were very surprised to see how tall he had gotten, and to tell you the truth, I haven't seen him that much besides a couple times when we have been home at the same time.  He is up to my eyes, which is crazy i suppose, since I am so tall, i hope he doenst pass me, I want to stay the tallest 
and I dont want that honor taken away, lol, just a talking point i guess, but nonetheless.

Other than that, very very busy, no rest for the weary.  

My sculpture is close to completion, actually a lot of work to do on it, but I will get it done, its going to be strong.

Friday was Hockey tryouts, or just a chance to show everyone how much I suck, so when I get good again, I will look really good.  It was a 2 hour skate and I was so out of shape, I am out of shape, holy crap.  I have another one next week, that I will be better at, hopefully the coach will stick around for my good side.  The real tryout won't be until next year, which is good, that means a lot of excersize this summer, and not a lot of eating badly, it all depends how good I want to be, and if I want to make the team in the first place, I am really busy now, i will be super busy with that too.

#1 School
#2 Work
? ? ? ?....Hockey, Newspaper, Social

I schedule my classes tomorrow but I pretty much know what it is going to be.
Tues/Thurs  12:30- 3:20 Art/ intro to ceramics
Tues/Thurs  6:00 - 8:00 Art/ intro to computer graphic design
Fri  9:00 - 11:50 Pol sci/ World Politics
Fri  1:30 - 4:20 Art/ Understanding Art I

Doesnt appear to be too bad, but when you factor in that I will be working Mon and Wed 8 - 5 and potentially have hockey at least 2 days, fri afternoons and nights, sat nights, and possibly 7am practices at least 3 days a week, + newspaper writing + finding time to do something for myself and hanging out with friends.  That leaves little time for anything else.  No time to meet anyone, thats for sure.


If you get the chance, buy the movie Death Race 2000, seriously unbelievable. circa 1976

JcPenny's can go to hell, when a tag is marked Large, it should be large, not medium, and even better is that Extra Large, is about the same size as large, which is a medium, what the crap.

Last night was a good night for a good dream.  I drempt I was standing on the highest part of the Millennium force.  I dont know how I got to the top of it, I was just there.  As I proceeded to get into the car, being the last one in, and sitting next to a nice looking girl I might add, my weight seemed to propel the cars forward at quite an expedient pace.  We rode around the track about four times.  When we stop, I get off, and everyone else appears to get ready to go again.  At this point, with no emotional or logical reason, I proceed to kick the roller coaster track.  When I say kick, i mean i kicked it and it fell over, crashed, broke apart, I destroyed it.  Now in the midst of this, the riders in the cars, were actually blown up, smashed, dead.  I calmly look around, a job well done it seems, and jump off the platform.  Good thing when I jumped I just happened to have a parachute.  I land nice and safe, right into the arms of the police, not knowing what if anything I did wrong, I protest, to no avail, obviously.

I think tonight may be the first all nighter of the year.  This sculpture has to be finished."

Winter has been a harsh mistress
As I look to the sky I can clearly see the sun
The clouds have gone on their way

Open, open all the windows and doors
To let in the breeze and all its warmth
come in, come in to unfurled arms
For four long months it has been dark
It has been cold, it has been dreadful out

We have waited all this time for the splendid sun to shine
To bask in it's rays and fill us with joy
No more are the days with overcoats, scarves and sweaters
The wicked weather has slackened its grip
and let us live once more
Snow has retreated to the hills, the valleys are alive

We anticipate spring and all that it yields
Bring our senses back, to smell the air
To see the colors
Hear the birds
folly in the fields
and walk outside with your head held high
Spring makes the heart beat faster and a smile to rise"

"event","So at least for one night, one event gives you renewed vigor, and makes you forget all your little pittly problems.

Yeah, that was last night.

Alex, Pat, Steve, Jeff and me are on the way to Grand Rapids for a concert.  I need to drop my truck in Birch Run for later.  Another stop at Burger King and we went on our way. There has never been a car ride in the history of car rides, when you have 5 people in the car, that you dont have fun just being right there in the car, and this was no different.  

After Finally finding The Orbit Room, cause this place is in the middle of a mall, we all get out and stretch.  We look around for a place with a bathroom.  

Option A) laundromat - not really a good choice when you have 5 people, likely only to have a small bathroom.

Option B) Dunham's/ Mall - This would have been a satisfactory choice, but more than likely the bathroom would have been way farther into the mall.

Option C) Best Buy - Probably the closest with the biggest bathroom, and probably the best decision anyone has made in a long long time. All of us go to the bathroom, while pat goes and looks around.  We come out and we are talking, and pat aproaches us and is almost speechless. He says in no uncertain terms,  martin mendez(bass) of opeth is in one of the aisles of the store, and he met him.  So we look and walk around slowly to see him. We see him and approach him and shake his hand and tell him thanks, thanks for making great music. Almost immediatly after walking away, we see mikael akerfeldt(vocals guitar) and go over to him and shake his hand.  There were a lot of people that were going to the concert at best buy, and no one else saw them.  I wouldnt have picked out martin, but mikael I would have.  That was really rewarding to just say thank you.

After that we didnt want to hang around and make them feel uncomfortable, so we took off and went and stood in line for the doors to open.  While we were standing there, they walked from best buy to their bus, right past everyone in line to see them, amazing.  I guess more people were there to see Devil Driver.....poor choice.

So we are about to get in out of the cold, cause it is freezing out with the wind, and we had been standing out there for like 45 min, there is one person in front of us, and they close the door to let people in, saying the lobby is too full.  So then we were outside another good 10 min, just to make us really cold.  Finally we are let in, and the lobby is clearly not that full, regardless, we stay in the lobby area for another 10 min and finally are let into the stage area.  We actually get two spots on the rail, to the left of the stage, but right in front of where the guitarist would be. 

Dark Tranquility is a really good show, no one is pushing, we stand there and enjoy. It was fun, they know what they are doing.  As soon as they are done or maybe on the last song, people start shoving their way up toward the stage, kinda squeezing in.  

Hilarious, when DevilDriver is warming up, the idiot sound guy doesnt know what he is doing, and the drummer, who is trying to get his drums to work with the mics, is getting pissed cause nothing is working and he is telling him to try stuff and then changing his mind and telling him something else, so finnally they just all left and let someone else figure it out, it took quite long.  They get it all set up and then DevilDriver comes out and plays.  The place goes nuts. I am no longer watching enjoying the show, I am worried about out spot, cause we are all getting moved down cause its one giant mosh/shove match.  I switch alex places and put up a wall, me.  The more people try to move me, the more they get moved harder.  Then there were these chics that thought they could just get away with everything, well, i think they finally left.  At one point these kids next to us, were getting demolished, and we were starting to get pushed on harder too, so I went into the fray and started moving everyone, not to mention, its easier to get people out of the way by lifting them up and making them crowd surf.  With steve at my back we keep our spot and actually move way up.  At one point the singer called for a circle pit, which i guess arent very common anymore, and things actually calmed down.  

In the aftermath, I had been punched in the face and kicked in the head, but oh well, it was worth it.  Plus Steve and I had secured a spot behind one row of people almost center for the main show, Opeth.  I won't attempt to describe how awesome it was when they came out and played, amazing.  Two people in front of us were leaving so we squeezed in, and then we were in a prime spot, almost center on the rail two feet away from Peter on stage, unbelievable.  They played songs from albums across the board, even their first.  Peter threw his guitar pic and it fell, and then i took it out of the security guards hand, so I have his guitar pic, i have his guitar pic, i still really can't believe it. 

So not only was the show, the best one I have ever been too, we got to shake hands with band members, meet them no less, get a guitar pic, slap hands a couple more times after but I got some amazing pictures, cause we were almost front and center, unbeleivable.

After the show, we picked up Krissy and went to eat at steak and shake, very good.  Had some fun, and then hit the road.  Good thing I slept most of the way home, cause I didnt end up getting to my house until 4, and then had to get up this morning at 7, ew, but I am actually not tired at all, I am too amped up.

Looks like a snow day, no school today, so I am not going to go home tonight, staying with the fam, working tomorrow, and then, Friday night is Anathallo, which won't beat Opeth, but it should still be a real good show."

"event","Today I skipped my 9th and 10th classes respectively.  I used to feel bad about this, until I realized a couple of things. 

A) I only skip for good reasons.
B) I generally like class, so for me to skip it takes a general dislike for the class or the professor

I have skipped Art history the most, that professor should be teaching a graduate class, not this one, he is actually the smartest dude I have ever met, in the context of his special subject, art in the non western world, or aztec, maya, teotihuacan's ect. Plus when you have lecture every class, in the dark, I tend to fall asleep, a nasty habit i picked up in 4th grade and carried right through high school and right into college.  There have been some classic sleep moments, but none greater than in this class, when he actually woke me up to leave, ""Time to go"" he said, and walked out, probably shaking his head, I would have too.  My other classes just get rather annoying, i mean, the 9:30 class, the only reason i skip is to sleep.  My 7-10 classes, i skip those to shirk responsibility, i mean, no other explanation, i just really dont want to go.


Opeth is tommorrow night already, that came up quick.  That will be a fun show, my first time seeing them, should be really good.  (also skipping two classes for that, totally worth it)  Also seeing Cartel, Copeland, Gatsby's American Dream and the staring line april 4th.  

The show that I am actually looking the most forward to, is the Anathallo show on Friday. Havent't seen them in a while, That is always a great show, and always like going to the local to make fun of all the scene kids.

Went to a concert last Saturday, Sigur Ros, that was a good show, the seats were kinda far back, but overall good experince, I bet even andy found it fullfilling, well ...

This last saturday, went to a show in Bay City, that was fun, first time at the Vag. 

I got ruined on the way home, going 60 down this bullshit road, fail to notice that when you cross into saginaw county, the speed limit goes from 55 to 45, and just like that i am 15 over, of course, a cop facing the opposite direction that I am coming, clocks me at 66, mind you, they are right next to a stop sign that i was slowing down for, totally impossible for them to clock me going that fast, but whatever, he  writes me for 55 in 46, nice guy eh.  Yeah, that was great, at the end of the 30 days to in which I am supposed to pay for this infraction, I think I am going to call the courthouse and say I need to fight this one.  I really just want it done with, I am not even that pissed, but, the longer I dont have to pay that 120 the happier I will be.  By taking it to court, there is one of two things that will/could happen.  1 cops dont like going in front of the magistrate, consequently, they skip the hearing sometimes, granting me, no ticket(never would happen for me)  2 It doesnt get processed for 3 or so months, and when it finally does, no one remembered what happened, therein securing me the benifit of the doubt, and the cop takes it down to a 50 in a 45, a big decrease, in both price and insurance increase.

What happened today actually takes the cake.  A wall got broke cause of this one,(not all of my fault) regardless total bullshit.  Last week I recieved notice that rent was due, fine, no problem with that, (even though I was hoping they wouldnt notice)  so today I go to drop off payment.  I go into our new apartment managers office, and give him the check for the specified amount.  Apperently unhappy with the exorbinent amount already scraping my pockets clean, he proceeds to tell me there is a late fee included.  Since we were never informed when to pay, why is there a late fee. 

""It clearly states in your lease agreement, the dates for payment""  According to this wanker, I am two months late.  The payment was due, Jan 10th.  Since it is clearly Feb, I am certainly not 2 months late one rent.  ""Well the way it works here might be different than other establishments""  Oh really, well I think I know what is different, oh wait, i mean just the same as everywhere else, your out for blood and money. So the notice I got said there was a late fee of 35 dollars.  Fine, i'll pay that, whatever.  No, no no no, It's 80 dollars, i actually said ""What the Fuck"" How did it go from 35 to 80.  He calmly takes his calculator and starts punching numbers.  He tells me they have changed it, and now it is 40 per month.  Now not only am I not 2 months late, but i am getting scammed.  Honestly, i could have punched this smug bastard.  He says ""yah a lot of people have been coming in here and calling me an asshole, knocking my door down to try and get me to cut them some slack"".  Gee, i dont know why.  I have always been able to restrain myself in situations like that, and it is probably a good thing, cause i dont think a trip to jail for beating the shit out of him would have been very smart.  One of the last things I said seemed to hurt his feelings while I was writing the check in horror, i said ""This is why i am not living here next year"" and to my dismay, he seemed puzzled.  True wanker.

Normandy seems to be in our future, depending on some things, but none of the four of us are living here next year.  80 dollars for a new screen, not only seems like a total rip off, it also sounds like a repetative figure.  I am pretty sure they charge the same for the ""trash fee"".  That means, if any trash of yours is found outside the dumpster, even when it is really full, and cant be fit in, or even if it is along side, or even scattered outside the dumpster, you get a nice fine.  Also, if a bag is found anywhere on the premises, they actually open it and try to find out whose it is.  

I realize this is a corporation that runs this place.  Even they have to realize what they are doing here.  High priced living quarters, followed by shitty internet, cable, and basic services, such as lockout rescue(meaning if you get locked out of your room/apartment, you get one free pass, and then every time after that is a 15 dollar fine) you know what that gets you, pissed of broke residents.  Or people that really could care less.  If you operate a place like this, you have to be able to comprimise.  College students don't have bank accounts worth more than a pittance.  Why take my 80 dollars, which could be used for ten million other important things.  Well, their not going to get my blood.....  Just wait, this place, will get whats coming to it.  I can't wait...."

"event","Valentines day was great, I played guitar hero for 5 hours, after eating $7 worth of taco bell.

Then I went to my sculpture class and worked on my sculpture for 4 hours, i was in a groove, i was working for the entire time, i was excited about it, it was just good.  Of course, music in my ear helps out immensly, and i listened to a lot of stuff.  

Then got some supplies at walmart, came home and watched High Fidelity.  Never get tired of that movie, it has a lot of quirks in it that i can personally relate to.

I thought my skunk broke his back last night, but he was just being a retard and playing stupid, he fell off my bed.

Saginaw Valley might, (might)(might)might, have a hockey team next year.  We had a meeting the other night, and the three guys that started it, know what they are doing, i can't even describe how happy i will be if that happens, i dont want to even get my hopes up after the last 3 years, wow, it has been 3 years, since i played a meaningful hockey game.

I guess if not hockey then i know they are starting lacrosse, which would kick ass too, but not as much as hockey.

Also, i have an interview at the newspaper for maybe writing for them, the school newspaper, that would be amazing, i would probably write some sports, maybe other stuff, yet to find out, if i get the job.

I have a sister now, thats exciting.  It's her birthday today in fact, the sister i never had, now i do, lucky me.

Thats about it, i mean, besides stuff here and there.  If anyone is interested in going to some concerts, let me know, i am already going to a few, and it would be nice to get some tag alongs.

anyway, peace out, if it was 1997 it would be cooler, but here's to 2006."

"event","Why can't everyone be upfront, honest, straightforward, and frank about everything, why do we all feel we need to hide behind walls/barriers.

Fear.

Thats why i don't do it.  I dont feel comfortable coming right out and saying what i really want to say sometimes.  If I just really want someone to know something, or am trying to impress something on someone, it seems the only way to do it is , some sort of scheme.  Sometimes, playing games with someone is fun, that is part of the thrill, but honestly, it gets old really fast.  No one wants to have to jump through hoops for weeks.  So, why dont you just do it.... right???,..... thats what everyone says. Thats not how it works, there are rules, etiquette, and such.  It's all crap, at least i dont like it, but who is going to change it, it has to be a mutual thing, not just one person, but everyone.  I know there are people out there that can just say what they want.  They can tell the guy in line to hurry up, tell someone they are going about it all wrong, ask someone out without the precursor of even knowing that person / talking to them first, and let everyone know when they are unhappy.  Well everyone hates those people, we usually refer to them as assholes.  On the other hand, who do you see with a girlfriend, the asshole, not the nice guy, whatever, nothing is going to change.  

nice guys finish last, so here's to being an asshole."

"event","It's 3:40 a.m. and its raining.  
It's not supposed to rain in January. 
I am not at all against the cool breeze penetrating my room through my open window, but it is January. 
I am not supposed to have a window open in January, especially not my apartment window.  
It's lucky I have the soft glow of the computer screen to see what I am doing.  
After midnight, you wont find any other light on in the house.  
It's strange to call a place like this home.  
I have 90% of my belongings in a 10x12 space, most within arms reach.  
Next year will bring bigger living quarters, where ever that may be, but it wont be here, which is a shame.

Lately I have been busy, not unlike anyone else, but all in all, very busy.
I have had class.
I have had sculpture, painting, photography and Art history.
This is the first semester without any Gen Eds.

I have had some of the weirdest dreams of my life in the two weeks.
Someone tried to pour a Demon in my mouth, while the heads of my family stared at me, whilst being held down.
I became Jet Li and tried to cross the ocean in a row boat, i was helped by whales.

Computers have been jacked.
My laptop
Alex's laptop
Nickie's computer
Dave's computer
Nicole's computer
Pat's computer
All different, all insane problems, as usual

Music is more comforting to me than anything 
I have downloaded more albums since christmas, than ever.
Current Favs (mostly indie)

Death Cab For Cutie ""The Photo Album""
Nada Surf  ""Let Go""
Youth Group ""Skeleton Jar""
Snow Patrol ""Final Straw""
The Postal Service ""Give Up""
Coldplay ""A Rush Of Blood To The Head""
Cartel ""Chroma""
Veda ""The Weight Of An Empty Room""
Brand New ""Deja Entendu""

Those are on my iPod

<b><i>""And i'll sit and wonder
Of every love that could've been
If i'd only thought of something charming to say.""</b></i>

Haha,... Yeah no kidding ben.  Now more than ever.... thats how it works, you have to be charming.


When it is after midnight, but before 3, there is no reason not to answer your phone.
Who knows, it might even be Jack Nicholson.
It's getting cold in here.
Even under these clothes, i can feel a chill.
It is time to crawl under the warm blankets.
Its still raining.
It's 4:21 a.m. and it's raining...."

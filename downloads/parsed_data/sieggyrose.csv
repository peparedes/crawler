In a way, I suppose I ought to be grateful to my roommate for allowing me to put the things on my mind into words.  However, doing so did nothing to make these irritating feelings vanish.  

I'm well aware that infatuation with someone should not be considered irritating, but in this instance it is.  I am in no position to act on these feelings, for they would bring about far too many complications both here and upon the return home.  Besides, it is not as if there is any chance these emotions would be reciprocated.

No, it is best just to remain friends.  It is a good friendship, and certainly no complications lie in that."

And so all I can do is have Ryuuzaki pay for what was damaged.  

If I see that little beast here again, I guarantee that it will be the last time."

"event","Mother is at long last safely on a plane back to Germany.  Now I can, at long last, fully turn my attention back to my beloved in his time of need.  And since I am over my cold and he has no chance of catching it, he will indeed be receiving my full attention."

"event","Yakou, dearest, I apologize for running off this morning.  I do not know what came over me!  

It really was almost frightening.  I just had to get out, without even taking the time to dress properly.  I barely remembered to grab my wallet.  I'm sure I was quite a sight to the cab driver I flagged down, in my pajamas, and asking to be driven to the nearest lake.  

And I just...  I leapt in!  I do not even understand what possessed me to do such a foolish thing - especially in this horrid weather!

It was a cold, wet, and miserable ride back.

<s>Dearest, if I get sick from this, will you be my nurse?</s>"

"event","Mother has put in a surprise visit for the holidays.  She has yet to return home.  Instead, she has been staying in my apartment, and I have been staying at Yakou's.

You'd think that by now she would be ready to return.  And yet, every morning Ryuuzaki is letting her in to join us for breakfast. 

At least she is managing to be polite to my dearest."

"event","My dearest has certainly gotten into the holiday spirit.  With the angels and the flowers and such, our home is looking rather fantastical.  <i>Our</i> home...  It still sounds strange to say, and yet it feels so very right.  There is something absolutely wonderful about waking up with the person you love and knowing that at night and for every night hereafter that you two will be returning to bed together.  

However, I do confess to be lacking somewhat in holiday cheer.  I called Mother to inform her of my plans to stay in Japan for Christmas.  I believe that saying she was livid would be understating the situation.  Some suitably extravagent trinket should be able to placate her, and perhaps a promise to spend the New Year with her."

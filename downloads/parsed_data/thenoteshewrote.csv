I love Rome.  Naples was fabulous as well but Rome is home and I'm glad to be back.  My apartment is magnificent, as are my roommates :).  This keyboard is funny.  It took me 2 minutes to find the colon to make that smiley face haha.  Anyway, I have to go to the grocery store because we need to get wine for our wine and cheese party tonight. I don't know what I'm going to do when I get home and I can't just buy wine in the supermarket to have with my dinner... one of the many italian habits I've already developed in a week's time.

I need to tell you all about my crazy cab ride story and sketchy italian boys in sketchy italian bars.  don't let me forget!

I have to run, I just wanted to inform anyone who reads this that life is wonderful... Love you all!



Ciao!"

my staten island trip was amazing this time around-  the rainforest cafe, the pool hall, the city, the hookah bar, and the emergency room- all in 48 hours! haha you all really are my heart and soul, i don't know what i'd do without you.  (if anyone out there is interested in evidence of my 2 funfilled days, photos are on facebook)


and tomorrow, the best roadtrip of 05 begins.  a week of trains, planes, and automobiles with dawn haha.  oh, and don't forget florida- you know, that place where the weather is better than it is here?  i am more than excited.  i'll let all you northerners know how much fun it was when i get back.


so that's about it... break has been a blast, and florida promises to make it better.  :-D


i contemplated filling out one of those end of the year surveys, but i don't think it's worth it... i can sum up 2005 in much less space than that.  Everything that went on last year, the good and the bad, taught me one very important thing:  I am happy.  Even when i'm not- i am and i've just forgotten.  and as cheesy as it sounds, that's really all i have to remember to make everything infinitely better.  After everything that's gone down this year i feel almost invincible.. like i can handle anything that's thrown my way.

and seriously, even if i can't- just thinking i can helps a whole lot.




so anyway... 2005 was wonderful and horrible all at the same time- but isn't every year?"

"event","you're all getting a livejournal entry because i've been thinking lately and you know that means that i'm going to be writing about it haha.  if you're not in the mood for me trying to figure out one of life's great mysteries i suggest you skip this one.


I don't know how grown men and women can voluntarily live with their parents.


I am a completely different person when I am at home.  I seriously feel like I'm at least 5 years younger.  I just act like a child when I'm here and I don't know why.  At school I'm completely independent.  I have no problem making phone calls and talking to professors and standing up for myself... but I can't seem to do any of that when I'm home.

Having my parents around just makes me feel like a child.  They don't treat me like a kid, but for some reason I feel like I am one.  I ask for permission to do things that I don't need permission to do lol... I honestly asked my mom the other day if it was okay if I did my laundry, because my hamper was full.  Why the hell would I need to ask my mother to let me know if I was allowed to clean my clothes?  I just asked the question without even thinking... like I couldn't do it without her approval.

At school I didn't think twice about doing anything, really... when I was spending a weekend with Kelly I just told my mom that I had decided to go home with her.  I didn't ask permission to leave campus, I just let her know what I would be doing. When I went to see Rock-a-pella with Mer, Elena and Cait I told my parents I was taking money out of my account to buy a ticket and going to NJ with my friends to see a show... I didn't even think that I would have to ask.  I just assumed there would be no problem- and rightly so.  There isn't a problem.  My parents don't care.  I get yelled at for asking stupid questions now.  Dawn's coming to pick me up next week and bringing me to SI... and I asked my mom if that was all right.  I want to go spend some time with allie this month and go to the city with her... and I asked if that would be okay.  I went to the city with a group of people from school and didn't feel the need to ask if I was allowed.  This just doesn't make any sense to me at all.

I always  thought that I was immature and would never grow up... but now I'm thinking that's just because I live with my parents.  When you're away at school you have to grow up, to some extent.  You have to clean up after yourself and make your own decisions without being nagged.  You learn to do what needs to be done... but I seem to have forgotten everything I've learned this past year.  I feel like I've reverted- like I can't be grown up because I am the child.  How can you ever grow up if you're still in the same exact environment you were in as a child?

I wasn't raised in the house.  I was almost an adult when I moved here.  I can't imagine what it's like to live in your childhood home with your parents as a grown person.  It must be so odd.  Or maybe it's just me... that's entirely possible, of course.  But I definitely feel younger just by being at home and I'm sure someone out there has to agree with me.




On a separate but related note, I also feel like I'm slowly turning back into the person I was last summer and I don't like that at all.  All the progress I've made this past year is slipping away and I don't know how to hold onto it.  I'm afraid to make phone calls again, for some reason, and I hate it.  I was going to call anthony tonight because I haven't spoken to him in a week or so... but I held the phone in my hand for 10 minutes and ended up not dialing.  I opened the phone book and scrolled down to ""franzolin cell"" and just couldn't press that green call button and I don't know why.  Now I'm mad at myself, of course, because I really did feel like talking to him tonight.  But I still won't call.  I don't know what I'm afraid of.  I couldn't call Jillian last week either.  I wanted to call her the night of her surgery or the day after or the day after that, but I didn't.  I'm glad she called me, because I wouldn't have spoken to her otherwise.

Sometimes I think I deliberately pull myself away from the world just to avoid the possibility of someone pushing me out.  Or maybe I'm afraid that I won't be pushed away- that maybe I'll be welcomed in and not know how to react.  Either way, I don't think I'm doing myself any favors.









You all should be glad I only write in this thing every once and a while.  Imagine how many pages of my ramblings you'd have to sort through to get to the more entertaining messages on your friends pages if I wrote often."

yesterday was full of bad things, and at the end of the day (Well, more like at 1 am this morning), i decided that life, in general, is good.

because for every bad thing that happens, there is a good thing to balance it out.




And I'm reminded more and more every day that I have the best friends in the entire world.  :-).


so, lets recap the good things that happened yesterday... because the bad ones honestly don't matter anymore.


I officially have a beautiful big room with carpeting and air conditioning and a great roommate for next semester :-).

I know how to keep my cool and respond in a mature fashion when caught off guard by unfounded accusations.

I decided that I do have the right outlook on life and people in general.  Because even when some people threaten my positive opinion of people, there are many others that (unintentionally) prove to me that I am going about things the right way- because if I wasn't, they wouldn't have stuck with me this long.

I'm happy to know that i have someone to look out for me, even if they're being completely irrational and much more violent then the situation calls for.  because that just shows me that i'm really loved <3 haha


lol i think that's it for now.  I was rereading entries from this thing since I started it after graduation... it's really interesting to look back and see how much you've changed.  you should try it.

Everything I need to know, I learned from The Beatles
Written by Rick Glover

All You Need Is Love
Love Is Here To Stay
It's All Too Much
Half of what I say is meaningless
I should have known better
Say the word LOVE
One day you'll look to see I've gone
I can see that I was blind
Only a fool would doubt our love
It's getting better all the time
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
Help yourself to a bit of what is around you
We can work it out
There is no one compared with you
A man must break his back to earn his day of leisure
Money can't buy me love
I could be happy with you by my side
All together now
Don't be cold as ice
You can celebrate anything you want
Remember I'll always be true
If you're lonely you can talk to me
All the children sing
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Because the wind is high it blows my mind
I may be a lover but I ain't no dancer
Nothing is Real
Think for yourself
I've got something I can laugh about
Pride comes before a fall
When I'm with you I want to stay there
Listen to the pretty sound of music
I need a fix cause i'm going down
One and one and one is three
You know how hard it can be
Dig It
I'm not what I appear to be
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
I'm taking the time for a number of things
I believe in yesterday
The farther one travels the less one knows
It's a love that lasts forever
Everybody's got something to hide
I'd love to turn you on
And in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make."

i learned a lot this weekend... having been in class with anthony noto means more than i thought it did lol- apparently my graduating in 2004 gets dawn a ""Get out of practice free"" card.  alex shouldn't keep rosary beads in her car, cause jesus probably doesn't enjoy much of what he has to see when he's hanging from her mirror.  when dawn and i go into gennero's ""to hug rob"", we should probably specify which rob we want to hug... because that old man on line looked so disturbed by that statement that we're sure his name must have been rob too.  my cousin mike makes things very interesting lol, so i should probably take him around more often.  dawn's little brother is a resident of both his house and his tub... lol... and dawn and i probably should not have let the boy order a waffle with ice cream and 2 cups of hot chocolate for breakfast- i haven't seen a nine year old that hyper in a long time.  i am a miracle worker lol- I show up on SI, and Franzolin is suddenly ""Desickified"".  hahaha i love that boy to death... a visit to staten island is nothing without a few hours spent with him.  


is that it?  i think so... the billeras, the cappiellos, and the bolusis are all awesome... but i didn't learn that this weekend, i knew that already.


i've decided that i don't want to transfer to wagner... i love SI, but love laf too, and i'd definitely miss it if i never went back... i actually think my friends on SI and I are closer now that we're farther apart, if that makes any sense.  we all have separate groups of friends now, and when we get together we're not only creating stories- we're sharing other ones.  and every time i go back it's like i've never left. i should be back at the end of april lol... dawn swears she's coming to get me herself so i can see the show.  which i'd definitely enjoy.  because a weekend on SI is a beautiful thing lol.



going back to laf tomorrow night... not looking forward to returning to class, but that's okay... i am looking forward to seeing everyone again.

"event","The Mayonnaise Jar & 2 cups of coffee....

When things in your life seem almost too much to
handle, when 24 hours in a
day are not enough, remember the mayonnaise jar and
2 cups of coffee...



A professor stood before his philosophy class and
had some items in front
of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked
up a very large and
empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with
golf balls. He then
asked the students if the jar was full.\

They agreed that it was.


The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and
poured them into the jar.
He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into
the open areas between
the golf balls. He then asked the students again if
the jar was full.

They agreed it was.


The professor next picked up a box of sand and
poured it into the jar. Of
course, the sand filled up everything else. He
asked once more if the jar
was full.

The students responded with an unanimous ""yes.""

The professor then produced two cups of coffee from
under the table and
poured the entire contents into the jar,
effectively filling the empty
space between the sand. The students laughed.

""Now,"" said the professor, as the laughter
subsided, ""I want you to
recognize that the jar represents your life. The
golf balls are the
important things - your God, your family, your
children, your health, your
friends, and your favorite passions - things that
if everything else was
lost and only they remained, your life would still
be full. The pebbles are
the other things that matter like your job, your
house, and your car. The
sand is everything else - the small stuff.


""If you put the sand into the jar first,"" he
continued, ""there is no room
for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes
for life. If you spend all
your time and energy on the small stuff, you will
never have room for the
things that are important to you.

Pay attention to the things that are critical to
your happiness.

Play with your children.

Take time to get medical checkups.

Play another 18.

There will always be time to clean the house and
fix the disposal.""

Take care of the golf balls first, the things that
really matter.

Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.""


One of the students raised her hand and inquired
what the coffee
represented.

The professor smiled, ""I'm glad you asked. It goes
to show you that no
matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of
cups of coffee with a friend.""


Please share this with someone you care about. I JUST DID.






My aunt sent that to me this morning.... really makes you think, doesn't it?

You guys are my golf balls <3"

Slow dancing on the boulevard 
In the quiet moments while the city's still dark 
Sleepwalking through the summer rain and the tired spaces 
You could hear her name when she was warm and tender 
And you held her arms around you 
There was nothing but her love and affection 
She was crazy for you 
Now she's part of something that you lost

And for all you know 
This could be 
The difference between what you need 
And what you wanna be 
Yeah, what you wanna be 

Night swimming in her diamond dress
Making small circles move across the surface
Stand watching from the steady shore
Feeling wide open and waiting for
Something warm and tender
Now she's moving further from you
There was nothing that could make it easy on you
Every step you take reminds you that she's walking wrong

Yeah, for all you know
This could be
The difference between what you need
And what you want

Every word you never said 
Echoes down your empty hallway 
And everything that was your world 
Just came down 

Day breaking on the boulevard 
Feel the sun warming up your second hand heart 
Light swimming right across your face 
And you think maybe someday, yeah 
Maybe someday

understandably, he does have to work tomorrow night and therefore plans to leave easton around 3 and does not want to get there much earlier than that...


but honestly, there's a storm coming.  if he plans to be on SI by 4 he should leave easton a little after 2, in my opinion.  which means, we should get there maybe 11ish, in order to leave time to buy books and grab something to eat.  no?

so we should definitely leave here by 9:30 the latest.

"event","boy, do i have stories to tell.


i think i'll start with this past weekend.



we are all ridiculous.


now, while that effectively sums up friday and saturday... it's not nearly as funny.  so, i shall recap.

get to the gator's... do some much-needed catching up.  <3 you allie.  gambled with her father... hahaha.  exchanged christmas gifts, finally.  we both rock and know each other very very well, for the record. 

then i get the phone call.  this is where it all goes downhill folks, so pay attention.  

it's joey... franzolin told him to call me to ask what i'm doing tonight and if they could meet up with us.  okay, fine.  we decide to meet at starbucks.  we're ready to leave now.  but, that's no good.  cause joey still has to go pick up franzolin and franzolin is in the shower.  well, for the love of god, please let the boy finish his shower and put some clothes on first.  lol... so the gator and i run a few errands, then show up at starbucks, abscond the comfy chairs and wait for the boys.

who show up in franzolin's car... so, joey had to drive to franzolin's house to leave his car there and get into the other car... no, i didn't ask.  i truly didn't want to know.  make the boys watch our seats when we go to get coffee.  they think that they've stolen our seats... until they realize that now they have to go get coffee and we get our seats back.  brilliant, they are. sit around and argue over what to do next.  alex and i want to play on the swings.  apparently, the boys think playing on swings in the freezing cold is not a good idea... perhaps they do have brains after all.

but i'm sammy so i win and we get to go swing :-P.  i've forgotten how franzolin can't say no to me lol... and how he's afraid of me.  we'll discuss that later.  lol.  so- go to midland beach to swing- with a stop to get a handball, cause apparently swinging in the dark is dumb but playing handball isn't.  i think i was right the first time- no brains.

we run around the jungle gym, realize that college has ""turned me naughty"", there is much inappropriate conversation and name calling... until i get insulted.  and i glare.  and franzolin goes running and forgets that he's 6""3' and the little metal archways on the jungle gym are not made for people of his stature.  bangs his head on two of them.  in a row.

i haven't laughed that hard in a long long time.

but don't worry folks, i got an update today and he's fine. no worries... lol.

so then we go back to alex's to hang out in the basement. i would recap that, but i have strict orders not to.  what is said and done in the basement, stays in the basement.

and i'll just leave it at that.

end the night with an arguement... apparently, i *Can not* leave before 3 tomorrow cause that's when franzolin gets out of work and he *needs* to see me before i go home.  but alex goes to work at 12:30... so i am told that lisa will babysit me and i have to shut up and accept that.  it's nice how he volunteers his girlfriend's services like that, really.

so... crash on the couch, and lisa shows up to sleep over.  pop in troy (<3) and fall asleep to it (guarantees sweet dreams =]).  wake up, eat breakfast, gamble some more. =P.  get dressed and head to lisa's... cause she's babysitting me and all.  hang out, sarah drops by, hang out with her while lisa ""gets ready"" for nearly two hours.  honestly now... she's nuts.  sarah swears she better be getting paid to babysit me for those two hours cause lisa's a slacker =].  wait around, eat lunch (lisa's mommy rocks =])... then franzolin shows up.  get ordered not to go home, once again.  parentals show up.

have to pry franzolin off of my leg because he has wrapped himself around it and is now whining.

must leave anyway... to be honest, i was kinda scared at that point.

went home... 


I miss SI =[.  you guys are absolutely positively nuts.... and i wouldn't have it any other way.
I love you all <3



now, for the Penn DOT story!  hahaha... told you i had a few of these.

decide that i should get a PA learner's permit and attempt to get a license in this state... so head to the DOT (sorry, DMV even sounds better... ugh).  bring some ID and whatnot, figure that i'll be fine.

nope, sorry, no can do.

first of all, mr. little old man working at the DOT tells me, i'm over 18 and therefore need proof of address.  i explain to little old man that i go to college and live with my parents.  little old man is confused.  all i have are bills from school. yes, just one school.  i only attend one school.  no, i don't pay any of the utilities at home.  i go to school.  no, i've never had a job in this state.  not even a part time one.  yes, i'm positive.  

turns out, after getting the third degree, i could just have my mom sign a piece of paper that says she's my mom and i live with her.

thanks, little old man.

now i need ID.
Valid ID includes a social security card and one of the following:  a birth certificate, passport *weapon's license* and - this is the kicker - a valid PA driver's license.

no tell me my friends, why would i be applying for a permit if i ALREADY HAVE A LICENSE?  and if i can use a weapon's license to get a permit, does that mean that i don't need to show a driver's license to own a gun?  are these people nuts?

whatever.  i've got a birth certificate.

now, i need a doctor's note.

yes, that's right, a doctor's note.

i need an MD to write down that i'm not an alcoholic, addicted to narcotics, or prone to epileptic seizures.  

okay, and for the record... as he's telling me this is an important step to getting a learner's permit the guy next to me - WHOSE ENTIRE LEG IS IN A CAST AND IS ON CRUTCHES - is getting a COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE.

so, i can't learn to drive cause i might be an alcoholic.  but the guy who can't walk can drive FOR A LIVING.  oh, i love PA.

so, i can't get a permit. i've never been to a doctor out here at all, so none of my records are here so i have to get a physical.  ugh.

but finally, little old man says something intelligent.

I should get a non-driver's ID card now, so when i come back i don't need to have all that extra paperwork.  all i'd need is my social security card, my ID card, and my doctor's note.

thank you, little old man.

so i get something accomplished.  i now have an ID that shows my current address, which i guess is an accomplishment.


and that, my friends, was my morning.


my afternoon consisted of shoveling and trying to sled on 3/4' of snow... lol.




laf on saturday..... i can't wait."

black*mail* and car issues and talking till i fall asleep in the middle of the convo and a trip to target in pjs (yes, the ones we slept in).  aaaand i got us there and back with absolutely no issues.  because i rock.
monday :: jillian
from delaware in the green bug... and to the Oxford Valley mall. confusing the woman in NY&Co with the 302 area code was priceless.  and walking out into the parking lot and right into a car with a laf sticker in the window- just a little creepy.  we should have left a note (Samantha and Jillian Laf Class of 08 were here? lol).  aaaand i got us to the mall, to B&N, and back with absolutely no issues.  i am getting better at this whole 'knowing where i live' thing :-).

and on the week's agenda:

tuesday: peddlers village
i'm in love with that place
wednesday: sara and kelly!
kelly swears she's coming to visit.  now i love both those girls dearly, but i am seriously worried that they will leave Wayne and never get here.  hahaha and i know kelly is reading this... <3 ya babe.  i expect you to arrive sometime this weekend ;-).  3 days should be long enough to leave, get lost, and get back on track :-P

and SI, possibly this weekend?  i hope.  i miss my boys... and the girls i haven't seen since thanksgiving <3

and all tru da blcok
Not a creature was stirrin,
not even Ed Koch

Da stockins were hung
by da furnace wit care
In hopes that by mornin
they'd all still be there

Me and this skank
was gettin ready for bed
I wore pajamas
She had a paper bag for her head

When up on da roof
I heard dis big crash
Thoughy it was burgular
I was gonna kick ass

I went out on da firescape
Looked up in da sky
And what did I see
Dis freakin fat guy

Wit a red suit and boots
Dat came up to his knees
In da moonlight he looked
Just like Dom Deluise

He had a big sled
Pulled by deese reindeer
He called one of them dancer
So I assumed he was queer

As he crept off the roof
It became clear to me
Dat dis guy was looking
To steal my TV

Over his shoulder
He had a big sack
He came down the stairs
as I planned my attack

I waited a second
Until the time had seem ripe
Smacked him in da head
Badda-bing wit a pipe

He fell to the floor
Wit a groan and a tud
I was kinda surprised
Dat I didnt see blood

Instead, he rolled over
looked me in da eye
When i seen whod I d hit
I near started to cry

I said ""yo santa ,,
I'm sorry alright?
Not for nuttin he said
""But this aint my night""

I got lost in da Bronx,
I ran over some nuns,
Had a near miss by kennedy,
Rudolph's got da runs

I'm out all freakin night
Bustin my hump
But I cant continue now
Not wit dis bump

So do me a favor
and be a real pal
Take over for me
and be Santa, Sal

I said, ""yo i'm from brooklyn
I aint right for da part""
But he said bein Santa
comes from da heart

He made me an offer
I couldnt refuse
Stop at every house..........
'cept for da JEWS

I got into da suit
and stepped onto the sleigh
Wondering just why reindeer
smelled dat way

Took off on my mission
Didnt wanna be late
While ol St Nick spended the night
Hosin my date

Dat night I was Santa
Bringin kids joy and bliss
And if you dont believe me
Then hey, JINGLE DIS

Since then i've been wit him
Each year in da cold
Ridin shotgun wit Santa
Cause he's fat and he's old

I'm his number one helper
I've been deputized....
So on dis Christmas eve
Don't youse be surprised

If you hear a voice say
Real loud and abrupt
Merry Christmas to all
Thanks alot-- Shut up!!!



... ah how i miss living in a place where people actually talk like that.... lol."

"event","ahh procrastination...

stolen from kelly- party shuffle, write down lyrics... and you all get to guess.  here we go.  i apologize in advance for all the christmas music lol.  that's what's currently overloading my itunes library.

1 - what a bright time/ it's the right time/ to rock the night away
2 - when you sent me off to see the world/ were you scared that i might get hurt / would i try a little tobacco/ would i keep on hiking up my skirt?
3 - i think you're so mean/ i think we should try/ i think i could need/ this in my life
4 - and it won't matter now/ whatever happens will be/ though the air speaks of all we'll never be/ it won't trouble me
5 - the stars and planets taking shape/ a stolen kiss has come too late
6 - all the times i've given in/ you fit me like a second stop/ one by one i will begin/ to wear you all the days i'm feeling thin
7 - i wonder what it's like when you're living with someone like me/ i'm a freak and i'm nervous when it's easy
8 - the tick tock of the clock is painful/ so sane and logical/ i wanna tear it off the wall
9 - how can i help it if i think you're funny when you're mad?  trying hard not to smile though i feel bad.
10 - she gets sad when there's nothing going on/ she says it makes her feel damn worthless
11 - so what now, it's plain to see we're over/ and i hate when things are over/ when so much is left undone
12 - the mood is right/ the spirit's up/ we're here tonight/ and that's enough
13 - all around the world there's a sinking feeling/ out there right now someone's feeling/ down on themselves and don't know why/ every night
14 - sometimes i feel/ like i am drunk behind the wheel/ the wheel of possibility/ wherever it may roll
15 - tomorrow we can drive around this town/ let the cops chase us around/ the past is gone but something might be found to take it's place
16 - for the life of me/ i cannot remember/ what made us think that we were wise/ and we'd never comprimise
17 - take a small example/ take a tip from me/ take all of your money give it all to charity/ life is what i got/ it's within my reach
18 - i pray my wish/ will come true/ for my child/ and your child too
19 - i cannot remember what life was like through photographs/ trying to recreate images life gives us from our past/ sometimes it's a sad song
20 - i just want someone to say to me/ i'll always be there when you wake/ you know i'd like to keep my cheeks dry today/ so stay with me and i'll have it made

there we go... lol.  that was fun- and completely unproductive.

shopped for friends here over thanksgiving
shopped for friends at home and most family this morning.

everything is bought... now i've just got to wrap :-)

i'm thinking that's what this afternoon is for, lol... locking myself in my room and getting my christmas presents organized


and i should probably do homework too, if there's time... lol.



ugh... i can't believe i go home in a little over a week... this is terrible.


i really really really don't want to leave... i have a million times more fun here than in that stupid new house of mine.  If i have to go anywhere, i want to go *home*

... back to Staten Island, New York, where everything's just a little stranger than normal... lol.  I do miss my friends back home :-(.


i got you all lovely lafayette themed gifts today... lol.  oh well... i hope i'll see you soon enough.  i've got an entire month off... i better spend it with you guys.

i'm so homesick... and by home, i don't mean that house i live in, that my parents and little brother live in, that i go to when i leave here for break.  I mean *home*.  that island i grew up on- the forgotten borough.  where you spend every friday night at the movies or in the mall cause there's nothing else to do.  where you can get lost leaving the stadium theater yet get home in record time.  where you can stay in starbucks till they kick you out, then head over to the diner (if allie can ever find it ;-)).  where you can eat twizzlers with sarah on the median in the parking lot outside duane reade and not care what anyone else thinks about you.  where you complain about how your school sucks, yet you spend 12 hours a day there... moving scenery no less- all because sam asked you too and you love the girl to death.  and speaking of school- why did we spend every day at lunch throwing ice at each other anyway?


why am i so fucking sentimental lately?  it's terrible.  i get upset at the stupidest things... i miss people too much.   it's sad.  it really is.  i mean, i have friends here.  i love my friends here.  they're amazing people, and i'd be lost without them.

but they're not my SI friends.  I will never find anyone like you guys... like my boys, who took care of me (sometimes a little too well ;-)).  there will be no one like the girls, most of whom i left behind in the hell-hole we used to call auchwitz ;-).   play practice... omg, play practice.  i just... i don't know.

i wish i didn't move.  i wish i could go home for breaks and be *home* and not in a new house that i barely recognize sometimes- possibly because it looks different every time i see it.  it's just not the same... not the same at all.

and sometimes, i just don't know what to do with myself."

I've got a a lot to do this coming week... so i've declared this my last break of the day.  i have papers to write :-(.

am in the process of picking out courses for next semester.. i can't believe that this one is half over already.  it went so fast... yet i also feel like i've been here forever.  i guess i'm just odd like that.


i love my friends :-).  i love the ones back home who call me to keep me updated (whether the news is good or bad) and the ones that just call to say hello.  I love the ones here who keep me sane, or in many cases drive me insane.... it's all good.


i'm addicted to thefacebook.com.   i seriously need to do laundry.  i'm going to cry if i don't pass psych :-(


i don't think there's anything else worth mentioning...

hmm... i love sarahsmile and i am so happy for her... i miss the gator and think she should get her ass in that car of hers and drive out to easton... i've gotten proposed to twice in one week and i don't think i can choose between the two... lol.

i should be writing my psych lab right now, but i don't feel that i can get anything done without doing this first...


like i said, i didn't know franky.  i know a lot of you did though... and i think that's why i'm so upset.  i want to be there for all of you... and i hate that i can't.  and i hate that even if i was there, sitting with all of you through all of this... i still couldn't do anything.  i can't fix this.  i know you're all grieving... and i can't do anything to make it better.

and i think that's what hurts the most.  the people i love most are miserable, and there's nothing i can do to help... especially not from here.


but please know that i love and miss you all... and if i make random phone calls and leave dumb voicemails just to say hello, that's my way of doing something.

i called anthony last night... and he made me feel a lot better.  i know he's there taking care of you all...


again, i love you.  if you need anything, call me... i'll get out there as soon as i can, i promise.

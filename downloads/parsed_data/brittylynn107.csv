"event","i've heard this song about 3 times on the radio and i heard it again this morning and i could never remember the words to get lyrics and they had never said who sang it before.. but i finally found em and i wanted to post em here so everyone could read it* its the perfect, end of the year/graduation song and it goes perfectly w/ my previous entry about yearbooks.. so enjoy:

Is it love tonight 
When everyone's dreaming 
Of a better life 
In this world 
Divided by fear 
We've gotta believe that 
There's a reason we're here 
There's a reason we're here 

'Cause these are the days worth livin' 
These are the years we're given 
And these are the moments 
These are the times 
Let's make the best out of our lives 

See the truth all around 
Our faith can be broken 
And our hands can be bound 
But open our hearts and fill up the emptyness 
With nothing to stop us 
Is it not worth the risk? 
Is it not worth the risk? 

'Cause these are the days worth livin' 
These are the years we're given 
And these are the moments 
These are the times 
Let's make the best out of our lives 

Even if hope was shattered 
I know it wouldn't matter 
'Cause these are the moments 
These are the times 
Let's make the best out of our lives 

We can't go wrong 
Thinking it's wrong 
To speak our minds 
I've gotta let out what's inside 

Is it love tonight 
When everyone's dreaming 
But can we get it right? 
Yeah but can we get it right? 

'Cause these are the days worth livin' 
These are the years we're given 
And these are the moments 
These are the times 
Let's make the best out of our lives 

Even if hope was SHATTERED 
I know it wouldn't matter 
These are the moments 
These are the times 
Let's make the best out of our lives"

"event","Yearbooks are all around now* it started yesterday when everyone got theirs, now its all around and i havent gotten one.. i didnt get one last year either* my mom says they're too expensive and the most important one is the senior one so i can get one then.. but its cool cause most of the time u just get people who are in ur classes to sign em and they always say something like ""have a nice summer"" or ""we soo gotta keep in touch"" i'm guilty of saying the same things.. and most of the time you don't see these people until september rolls around again.. so what happends in the senior yearbook? you really might never see some of these people again.. i was just wondering this while writing in yearbooks today (continuing w/ my revelation)* i decided to create a ghetto fabulous yearbook w/ 5 pieces of looseleaf, and since there isnt a lot of room anyone who really had something to say could write in it.. so kat was the first one* she wrote a page long dedication to this year and everything that happend between us and i realized that this is what will fill my head as i leave o'hara -- these page long dedication to everything that we'll go through... i mean we're friggin juniors next year.. last year we were freshmen * this is just hittin me that your time is short.. maybe i will miss o'hara more then i thought i would -- plus ashley told me she'll miss it too and i was like ""what the hell??"" she didnt think she would.. but she does... i dunno -- maybe i'm just tired lol and i have work tonite (grr) oh well please leave your thoughts biotches :)*"

"event","haha -- i have no clue why i put that as my title.. i just love that movie (lol) anyway i have three days to cover in this because i've been soo tired i havent even turned on my computer

Saturday: we had the party for my sister.. it was an amazing time but i was soo beat afterwards -- i did like all the decorating, entertaining, dancing w/ the little kids, playing w/ the little kids, chasing after the little kids, plus i had to clean up at the end and i couldnt go out after it so i was mad.. then ash is allowed out.. that really sucked -- but we got some goooood food from it (*roast beef, meatballs, chicken, lots of snacks, and cookies*) so i guess it was ok.. i was just tired

Sunday: Megs party!! we had a great time playin little kiddie games like twister and whisper down the lane (haha yes!) oh oh and we soo sang karaokee.. that was a good time -- then i actually managed to stay dry as the girls had a water/cake fight.. funny to watch but i didnt wanna join in :) -- we scared meg out of her mind to the point where she couldnt breathe -- haha she wasnt expecting anything :) (hehe sneaky)

Monday: wicked hott in school.. ridiculously hott and i could not concentrate at all* im sooooo ready to get out.. everything feels like a formality now -- like we're just showing up and going up.. but it feels like it will never end -- omg i cant wait for this weekend i just cant wait.. i need a vacation bad!

and its way to hott up here for me to write more :) i'm goin down in the air conditioner biotches! love you!"

I've been long, a long way from here 
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos, 
And drank til I was thirsty again 
We went searching through thrift store jungles 
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo 
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen 

Well, o.k. I made this up 
I promised you I'd never give up 

[Chorus] 
If it makes you happy 
It can't be that bad 
If it makes you happy 
Then why the hell are you so sad 

You get down, real low down 
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train 
Well who hasn't been there before? 
I come round, around the hard way 
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread 
And serve you french toast again 

Well, o.k. I still get stoned 
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home 

Chorus 

We've been far, far away from here 
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos 
And everywhere in between 
Well, o.k. we get along 
So what if right now everything's wrong?"

We're doing nothing. Well i gotta go get a b-day gift for my dad. My old boss offered me my old job back for more money and a lot more hours. i have to think about whether or not i wanna take it. it would be a lot more convient than phonathon, i'd get more hours. i can only work like 3-6 next semester. that's hardly anything. tonia would give me 10-12. well we'll see. I have a lot of things to think about this week.

"event","So New Years was acutally a lot of fun. Mary and I ended the year by going to see Phantom of the Opera. We came back home and ate food. Yummy. We called Tom. He was getting out of work, but sounded glad to hear from us. We called Brad but it went to voicemail. He called us back on my house phone at 11:30 drunk off his ass. It was hysterical!! Mary and I rang in the new year with a glass of champagne. YaY 2005!! Brad called us back we talked some more. Mary and I went to sleep. I dropped her off at home in the morning. I celebrated my mom's b-day with my parents. There was some drama. We went to Wildfire for dinner. YUMMY!! We came back home and Courtney, Mary, and Brad came over. We watched a bootleg copy of The Gradge with my brother his girlfriend and their friend Jessica. That was fun. I know I know I talked too much. It's my curse!! Brad, and Mary stayed to play pool with Joey and I. Mary and I almost beat the boys!! It was sooo close! We went out to drop mary's van off at her house, and bring her back because she was gonna sleep over. As we were leaving Brad got in a tiny fender bender, but everything is fine. No damage!! Today Mary and I woke up late, ate some lunch. I dropped her off at home. CAme back took some christmas decorations down, and went to see Polar Express with the family. We also went to Coldstone!!!!! 1 week till we go back! I can't wait anymore!! The suspense is killing me officially. Brad's coming back on Jan 9. And who knows about Tom. Well things are well here other than that. Lots of exciting new events on the horizon. I'm excited it's going to prove to be a much better semester.

"event","It's been an exceptionally borring day. I babysat a bit tonight. Made some monies. Talked to Thomas a bit before that. He wants DDR for his b-day. THAT'S $80.00!!!! He told me not to get it. That makes me even more determined. lol. Never tell me not to do something. I'm like a lil kid. It was good to talk to him. He's like my brother sometimes. That big brother I never had. The one whose always looking out for me. TElling me not to do things. At first there was sexual tension between us, and a lot of weirdness, but the last few days especially I've been thiking about him. It's been hard to go without talking to him. I value his friendship a lot. And after what happened with Vince and all. I don't wanna loose his friendship and I won't let it be jeaopardized by a stupid physical attraction.   I talked to my mom today about this whole indecison thing. She say it's not a big deal and that it happens to everyone. I think I'm just worried about my internship. I was thinking about it some more. I know what I don't want. I DO NOT WANT TO WORK IN CHURCH. I want to do spirituality, but no necessar8ily religion. I DO NOT want ot work with Teenagers. No offense to my friends who are teens, but teens are not exactly fun to work with. I don't wanna do administration either. So I'm think I'll do Young Adult minstry, which is like working with College age and above. 18-30ish. That's my type of people. I'm gonna put a call into my friend Nick in the archdiocese see if he can help me out there. We'll see what happens. Maybe something will come up. I donno. Right now I'm just hoping for some kind of direction. I'm a lil lost right now."

"event","Ok I know it's noon, but whatev! I had a very borring day yesterday. I lounged around the house all day. WAtched soap operas, and did nothing. I talked to Bard in the morning, that was pretty much the highlight. I texted Tom at like 11:30pm to tell him how bored I was. He texted me back that he was doing nothing. We went back and forth a lil. Until about 12:45am. Then I said goodnight and went to bed. We had done some texting the night before, as well. It's becoming a nightly ritual. Which is cool because I have missed having actual conversations with him. Mary comes back today from retreat which makes me so very happy. I have been lost without her. It has been truly devestating!I have to babysit tonight at 5:30. I'm kinda excited, it means more money. YaY for monies!! Okay so no one is online. I'm guessing Bard and Tom are opening at Target because neither is online right now. My mom and my brother are fighting about new years. Figured right?! AHHHH... lazy day!!

"event","WEll I just got up after a very weird dream. I have been having extremely weird dreams lately and I'm not sure why. This one had all the ex's competing in some kind of dating game, it was for some really ugly man looking girl. But they all had to go on as part of their sentences. Like they were being punished. I was there as the host. It was very strange. Today is a lazy day, thank God. I can curl up and read my book. I love lazy days. DO you ever get that feeling that your not alone? That someone is always watching you, no matter where you are? It's paranoia I know, but it makes me feel very uneasy. Anyone who really truly knows me, (there are only about 3 people) will tell you that I'm paranoid. This is one of those rambiling entries that make no sense, because I want it to make no sense. So I'm in my house, my brother is sleeping, no one else is here, and I have the distinct feeling that someoe else is here. I have always thought my house was haunted. There is something here, I just know it, but I can't quite put my finger on it. There isn't really an explanation. I don't know it's probably me being stupid again. I want ot go back to school, it's hanuted there, but I've never felt all paranoid like this, at least not about the ghosts, maybe the humans, but that's another story.

We went to Best Buy and I purchased my mom's b-day gift, and a cd case for my car. We went to Target as well, and Mary did some shopping then we were walking out and saw t-shirts. CAn't tell you it's a surprise but they are fabulous!!! Then we went ot the mall. I bought a shirt from Ny and Co. A skirt and sweater from JC Penny. And TWO fantasmical calandars from The CAlander Co. One is Camelot paintings. OOOO I love it!! And the other is black and white photo's of the perfect man. OOOO hot and sexy!!! Then we went to Barnes and Noble. I got three books. ""The other Bolyen Girl"", ""The Bend in the Road"", and ""North and South"". It was a lot of fun! I had a great day! Yay! I'll write more later. Nighty night everyone!

"event","I have not updated much. So Tuesday Mary and I went to the mall and did some shopping. I reenacted Tom's escalator preformance for her b/c she was not there. We laughed. Then we dyed my hair. I'm in love with it. Talked to Tom a lil bit. Yesterday, I babysat in the morning and watched Lord of the Rings Two Towers. I actually enjoyed myself. When it's explained by a six-year old, he's bad he's good etc. I really got it. Then I picked Mary up and we got ready to meet up with Bard for dinner and a movie. We went to Red Robin for dinner, the Target to get movie candy, and then we went to see Meet the Fockers. (ass... hole!) We were very delighted to discover that Bard does not know what a tupperware lady is. And over all it was just good to see everyone. It was freaking hilarious!! We went to Steak and Shake, and Mary and Bard had shakes. Then we came back to my house and hung out for like 2 hours. We just talked. God I missed those wee morning hour talks. We had a lot of fun. The other family members were sorely missed however. Although not totally absent as we called Meaghan. (Bard left her a hilarious message!), and talked about Tom, okay we made fun of him. So anyways, it was a great night. We had a ton of fun. I needed my fix. As Bard so astutely put it. Tomorrow is christmas eve. I can't believe it. That's crazy. I've already been home a whole week. I've seen Mary a lot, and Bard once. I talked to Meaghan on the phone. I talk to Tom online everyday, but I still miss them a lot. I miss all my other friends too. I am not hating being home though. Being able to see Mary has made is bearable. I'm keeping busy don't worry too much. This is actually the first day I haven't had anything to do. I'm sure next week with Mary working it'll be a lil more boring. But only 2 weeks left and I'm back to school. Hopefully we'll all get together at least once more. Now I must be going. Happy Holidays my loyal readers!

Oh and a tiny side note, seeing as this is my journal I'm going to post anything I want. If I decide to post the whole freak alphabet 40 times I'm going to do so. You are under no obligation to read my journal. If you do not like what I post here then don't read it. I very much doubt someone is holding a gun to your head. Further more, what I post here is my life. It may seem trivial to some, but to me it is the world. It is what I live everyday. Others may have more signifigant or pressing issues to discuss, all I want to discuss is what I post. This is my journal, not yours. While I realize it is online, and in the public forum, as I have stated before, you are under no obligation to read it. So please don't. I do not understand how a post about MY feelings in MY journal can be offensive enough to someone for them to insult me. You do not live my life, you od not know who I am. So just do yourself a favor and stop picking on others to avoid fixing yourself.

"event","Well it had been a fairly lonely few days until yesterday. I talked to Brad and Tom a few times. Meaghan and I talked once. I had not talked to Mary at all. She called last night and we decided to go out. We went to Cantera to see Spanglish. It was an absolutly wonderful movie. We had a great time. There was a preview for this Topher Grace movie, I can't get over how much he looks like Tom. It's uncanny. I can't believe I never saw it before. (A little aside: I love Topher Grace. I seriously want to meet him and like jump on him. I think he's adorable. He's one of my favorite actors, lookswise) So today I'm going out to lunch with my grandma, and my car is broken. I hate it when my car breaks. It's leaking anti-freeze. GRRRR. Tonight I will probably just chill at home. So if anyone is free and wants to do soemthing... feel free to give me a ring a ling. Right now it's almost 11:00 and I should be doing laundry, getting ready, or working out. But instead I'm writing in LJ. Oh what has my life become. 18 days left ladies and gents!! Then I can go abck to school. Oh my god I miss school so much. I think the boys are gonna move back on the 12th. That kinda sucks a bit, I don't really wanna wait that long to see them. I really miss being able to pick up the phone or get online and say ""Lets go get pie"" or ""Lets go get dinner"" or ""Come over I need ot talk."" Well I""ll stop complaining.

"event","So in a way I am very glad to be home. I missed my bed, and my house. Even my family, to an extent. BUUUUUUUUUUUUUT... I donno I really miss my friends. Tom just im-ed me. He doesn't realize how hard it was ot say goodbye to him. In a month he's gotten to be one of the only people I trust. We won't go very long without talking to each other. He's too important to me and he knows it. He says I've made an impact on him as well. I'm glad. Mary lee is still at school. Leaving her was really hard too. She has become my sister. I have so much fun laughing with her. I almost cried when Bard left. We're pretty close too. He's always been around for me. And he listens even when the subject matter makes him uncomfortable. He'll run over. The three of us had a lot of fun last night. We dyed Tom's hair. It's auburn. It look hott. We dyed Mary's too. It was fun. We went to CVS twice. We went to Taco Hell adn WEndy's. We played some fun fun Mario Kart. Tom totally whooped my ass. Brad did some times. I got in first place 1 time. Mary lost every game. Then she went to bed and Jason came up to play with us. Saying goodbye is really hard, especially considering how close the 5 of us are. Hummel left on wednesday. I miss her too.  It's kinda like Wizard of Oz. I've got my Glinda, definately Hummel. I've got my Tin Man, totally Bard. I've got my Cowardly Lion, so totally Mary. The Scarecrow, the one I'm gonna miss most of all, Tom. :::sigh::: It's only 3 weeks. I miss my friends....

"event","""Harder To Breathe""

How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step cause if I do you'll need a miracle

You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
This Double Vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to funkin' tread the ground that I'm walking on

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to what I've said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control

Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there cuz its gettin harder and harder to breathe"

"event","So these lyrics totally make sense right now. I am really insecure. And well... we all know the rest. If you think you know who this is about you don't...

Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I?ve had you so many times but somehow
I want more

I don?t mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get insecure
It doesn?t matter anymore

It?s not always rainbows and butterflies
It?s compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door?s always open
You can come anytime you want

I don?t mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch him every time he falls"

"event","Well we decided to party last night. I see the remnants of a good time strung around my room. It looks like a tornado went off. I have the distinct feeling there was some table dancing and some sheets involved. Pshhh... I know! (haha) I don't remember much else. But as I look around at a broken shot glass on the floor and empty liquor bottles strewn around the room I know it must have been fun. Wait.. what the hell are all my clothes doing on the floor. I know we went to IHOP at 7am, with Brad. I also remember tom never came by last night. I vaugely remember seeing him... but why? I wish I could remember a little bit more. Hummel is passed out asleep on the futon. Mary and I went to lunch at noon on the cafeteria. Brad is awake, doing homework probably. Tom is asleep. It's a quiet day at good ol' DU. I'm thinking about heading home for a bit to see the parentals. I think I will. this situation with Tom is okay. A little weird but okay nonetheless. We're good at being friends. No one understands what's happening to me right now. No one ever could. I'm probably getting very emo but whatev. I'm just feeling weird. I don't really want to get drunk and party all the time, but that's all I can do. It's the only way that nothing bad exists. I don't have to think about my biggest dream going down the crapper, or anything else. I can be fun. I don't know this stupid LJ makes me very philosophical sometimes. Brad listened to me whine yesterday for and hour. I hated that. I mean I love that he felt the need to listen, but I hate it too. I don't think Mary, Tom, Brad, and Meaghan realize what they do for me everyday. Tom might, I tell him enough. Brad maybe. I think he got the gist yesterday. Meaghan... I don't know. She doesn't know a lot. Mary I really don't know. I wish... something. Anything could care about me. the way I care about everything else. Sometimes it's just so one-sided. Sometimes I forget to breathe. I'm forgetting right now. I don't know how to get out of this numbness. I miss Vince, I miss his friendship. Soemtimes I miss Dom too. I miss everyone and everything. I miss Tom right now. I could use a hug from him. He's sleeping though. I wish people would understand that right now I'm on the edge and I'm about to fall off. I think I'm slipping. What do I do? funny how this entry started happy and then got all sad. Goodbye...

i'm tired of being what you want me to be 
feeling so faithless 
lost under the surface 
i don't know what you're expecting of me 
put under the pressure 
of walking in your shoes 
[caught in the undertow / just caught in the undertow] 
every step that i take is another mistake to you 

i've 
become so numb 
i can't feel you there 
become so tired 
so much more aware 
i'm becoming this 
all i want to do 
is be more like me 
and be less like you 

can't you see that you're smothering me 
holding too tightly 
afraid to lose control 
cause everything that you thought i would be 
has fallen apart right in front of you 

[caught in the undertow / just caught in the undertow] 
every step that i take is another mistake to you

i may end up failing too 
but i know 
you were just like me

"event","Last night was Hollyball. It was fun. We went to dinner beforehand, Tom, Brad, Meaghan, Adam, Mary, and I, so we had good food. It took me only 2 and a hlaf hours to get ready which is amazing! I looked hot though! We also exchanged grab bag Christmas gifts. Everyone really enjoyed there's and that's good. Tom got me chocolate... he's my favorite person right now. We drank before the dance. And during the dance. We drank a lot!!! the remnants are scattered about me on the desk. A digital camera, some dirty shot glasses, my earrings, some pepsi cans, an empty tequila rose bottle. Things are looking fine here. I'm exhausted though. The dance was fun too. There were a good amount of people there. Tom and I went down with everyone else but after 10 minutes got bored and came up to drink some more. We did that 4 times. I can't even imagine what people thought! HaHa! Oh well fuck 'em! I actually got him to dance too. A few times! No slow dances... we didn't hear any. I don't even know if they played any. Before the dance I had agreed to iron Tom and Brad's shirts. They were really wrinkled. Well Brad's came out fine, but Tom's was a disaster. I swear he slept in it. ALOT! So we put in in the shower while I showered to try and steam it. Then while Hummel showered. Then while Tera showered. THEN i put the water on, and let the shirt take a shower for an hour. finally it looked halfway decent. I did Tom's hair too. Although it kept being weird. He loked hot though. So did Bard, or sexified as he called it. I think a good time was had by all! oh well on the way up to the room there was a group of idiots banging on the elevator doors, when they opened I said ""That's really stupid!"" and Brock said, ""Whatcha gonna do turn me in for sexual harrassment again?... muble mumble mumble"" I'm sure the last part had something to do with Bitch. i'm turning him in on monday. :) have a good day all!

"event","It's a good thing nobody really reads my journal b/c today's entry mgiht make some people really mad. Yesterday Tom's g/f was here at school. I don't know why this bothered me so much. I'm lying I know damn well why it bothered me so much. Everyone thinks it's b/c I'm jealous and that I want him as a b/f. That's not the case. While I do like Tom and think he is a great guy, I do not want him, or anyone else as a b/f right now. I love having him as my friend however. Which is why yesterday was so stressful. As much as he and I are trying to pretend that Friday never happened it was not working because I still feel very guilty about it. Guilty as in, I swore that I would never aid in this happening to another woman, and I did. I hate this. He's such a decent guy, and this really sucks. Everyone says, ""Oh Lauren you didn't do anything wrong."" But then my friend who also got with someone who had a signifigant other says, ""Well they had an agreement, and I didn't know she had a b/f so I didn't break any rules."" I looked at him and said, ""Tom and Jen don't have an agreement, and I knew damn well he had a g/f. I broke rules!"" Brad says I should be mad at Tom, or rather that what happened that night is Tom's fault. Everyone says I should just forget about it. The problem is... With everything that has gone on this semester I can't seem to just let this go. Tom and I had a huge fight last night, because I overreacted to the whole thing. He hung up the phone on me. I was glad he did. He made me realize that I was acting the same way with him that I had been acting with Vince. A few weeks ago I stopped taking my meds. I think I need to take them again. I totally think that whatever is going on is a little too much for me to deal with without my meds. Tom is my friend, and I am very obviously hurting him. Or at least annoying the hell out of him by blowing this way out of proportion. I should go to class now, but all I want to say, even if he doesn't read this, is I'm sorry Tom. Yesterday I was not myself. Actually I have not really been myself for about 1 and 1/2 weeks. I took my meds this morning. I cannot will not should not have another Vince on my hands. Tom you are too good a friend for me to do this to you. Your g/f is your business. I hope, since we're friends, that I can meet her next time she comes over. Because we are friends, and I think that is the first step to making it so. By hiding, and being secretive we were admitting guilt and making the problem exist. By meeting her the problem goes away. It doesn't exist. I'm trying to convince myself of this. It will still be really weird. I will still be really upset, because I will still feel like a whore, but for now I'm keeping that to myself and you LJ. Off to class~!

Diana was down there working on her graphics homework, which tom was also doing. Then this guy came in who we well make fun of all the time. He's really dumb. Just a total pothead idiot. So he comes up to Tom and says, do you have an old fashioned stapeler b/c I don't know how to use the automatic one!!! YES FOLKS IT""S TRUE! So I said ""Oh please dude!"" I grabbed the paper out of his hands and did it for him. ""See all ya gotta do is shove it in there."" this is amusing b/c he does not know hwo to do this in other aspects of his life either!! Tom does think it's all that funny but Diana and I can't stop laughing! The funniest part is Katie was down there earlier and jokingly asked him. Just to piss him off. Ahh my friends. We went on a food run last night. 3 stops. First Sub T's for Mary and I, then Wendy's for Bard Jason Kristen and Elaine, and then finally Taco Hell for Tom because he's such a good friend. I even paid for him. We got a lil lost looking for Sub T's but it was a good night overall. i love my friends.. It's 9:30. i'm tired. i hate finals week.

"event","To add ot my entry of last night. Tom really made me think yesterday. I have been really selfish lately. I mean seriously all I fucking care about is myself. Come and help me, come and be with me, i'm lonely, i'm busy, I'm hurting. I've been mad at tom about this whole g/f thing because it was weird FOR ME. God I have not even thought about him. Or Brad. I'm not thinking clearly lately and it's bad. I'm kinda dumb. Oh well. Well no not oh well. I mean I really should get all of this straightened out. I need ot start living my life a little better. I need to not care what people think, but also I need to be not so selfish. I need to stop worrying about trying to be a girlfriend, and stick to being a  friend. Tom is probably the only person who could say that kind of stuff to me without me wanting to shoot him. We ended out convo at 4:00am yesterday. I was exhausted and I over slept my first class, but it was well worth it to get an interesting look at my life. Thank you again Tom.

"event","So as much as he pissed me off at first, by being honest and saying I was neglecting soemthings, Tom really made me feel much better tonight. He was so honest, and yet so helpful. i'm feeling very lost right now and nothing really makes sense. He's the one thing that probably really shouldn't, and yet in some respect he really does. He's very apt to tell me exactly how he's feeling and what he's thinking. 

Cadet128: you shouldn't drink a lot
Cadet128: but if its there
Cadet128: you will
Cadet128: drink it

He's just like that. He'll tell me, yeah you're kind of a lush. In nicer words, but he knows how I am. He's an ass, but in the end it's for my own good. So I started out being really pissed off at him, and then 2 hours later, well soemtimes he's the only one who can make me see the truth. Sometimes the truth comes at 3am. And most times it's in very unlikely places. Thanks again Tom!

"event","So yesterday was kind of a bad day. I'm not really sure who to be mad at. So Tom's g/f was here yesterday. And he's my friend so it didn't matter. Except that it did. Yesterday was the first time that it was real that he had a g/f. You see she and I had never been in the same airspace before. It was the first time I felt like ""the other woman."" Even tho I'm not. I hid out in my room all night so as to avoid seeing them. That would've been really weird. And not so fun. Brad came over and hung out with us for a long time. Brad and I decided to go get milk and cookies in the commons. I was so scared we would see them. I begged Brad to pretend we were dating, if we did see them. I don't want to get Tom in trouble with her. Hummel wanted me to bring his suit up to his room and say. ""Here you left this is my car when we went home yesterday."" That would have been really bitchy. I would never ever do it. It bothered me because yesterday was the first realization that what happened was really wrong. I've felt bad up until now, but last night made me feel like shit. It made Brad feel really weird too. A part of me is mad at Tom because I don't think it's fair what he's doing to her. A part of me is mad at myself for letting this happen. I donno what to do. I just feel really shitty right now.

Listen as the wind blows from across the great divide
voices trapped in yearning, memories trapped in time
the night is my companion, and solitude my guide
would I spend forever here and not be satisfied?

And I would be the one
to hold you down
kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
and after, I'd wipe away the tears
just close your eyes dear

Through this world I've stumbled
so many times betrayed
trying to find an honest word to find
the truth enslaved
oh you speak to me in riddles
and you speak to me in rhymes
my body aches to breathe your breath
your words keep me alive

And I would be the one
to hold you down
kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
and after, I'd wipe away the tears
just close your eyes dear

Into this night I wander
it's morning that I dread
another day of knowing of
the path I fear to tread
oh into the sea of waking dreams
I follow without pride
nothing stands between us here
and I won't be denied

and I would be the one
to hold you down
kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
and after, I'd wipe away the tears
just close your eyes..."

"event","So I'm going to try and explain the bad mood. Basically everyone kind of knows my situation. It has been a rough semester. Basically at the moment I'm feeling bad for myself. I shouldn't be. I am. I tel my mother a lot. i know I shouldn't. She only makes me upset. Today she got me mad because she was trying to push me into a summer job, I can't say yes or no to it because of my summer internship. AHHH. I don't think I can take an internship, summer school, a job, and Europe. I don't know. Then there's this whole Theology Club thing. I hate that I quit. I hate hate hate that I can't do it. I hate that I had to turn it over to Vince. It's admitting defeat and I shouldn't do that. I did it. I am really over stressed right now. It's waaaaay too much for me to handle. I'm glad it worked out this way. I think. Shit I donno. Like I've been telling Tom for days. I donno anything anymore. In June ask me who I was and what I was about I could've told you. ""I'm Dominick's g/f. I am the president of the theology club and I love it. My friends are Diana, Vince, Dan, Courtney, her b/f Jim."" There were a few others but those were the main ones. I was so excited to live in a suite. Now ask me who I am. I donno. I am not in Theoclub anymore because I hate it. I'm not Dominick's g/f, in fact contrary to popular belief on campus, I'm not anyone's g/f. My Friends are Meaghan, Mary Lee, Brad, Katie, Doug, Adam, and Tom. Diana and I still talk, but not as much. vince and I hate each other. Dan and I hardly talk. Courtney is still my friend but she's so far away. Shes not dating Jim and he and I aren't speaking. My whole life has changed. I donno who I am anymore. So then there's this Tom situation. Tom and I are friends. Good friends. Nothing more. We hang out a lot. We're together a lot. He makes me laugh, we have a lot of fun together. But there is nothing else going on. He has a g/f. People now have been thinking I'm some kind of ""homewrecker"" or ""whore"" or whatever. Obviously this does not make me all warm and fuzzy inside. I'm not a happy camper about it. I jsut found this quote in my friend Tera's profile. this is kind of whats going on. I am not what I thought I was. I'm not what most people think I am. But I think people think I'm a homewrecking whore, and that's what I am to other people. It might not be what I really am, but it is how people percieve me. I don't know what to do. I'm really sad right now. I just want to laugh. I can't. I want to cry. I can't make myself cry. I wish I could...

I'm not who you think I am

Well I think Tom is gonna come over and talk for a bit. Goodnight everyone.

"event","It's been a really long day everyone. Not a bad day. I got two hugs from Tom and B-Rad. Which was mucho exciting! They totally made me feel better. But in response to everyone's critisim and bitchiness, I have decided to step down from the Theology Club. This pains me to no end. I wanted to be president more than anything. I still do. But not like this. I can honestly say that those three weeks with Vince ruined my first semester of junior year. And most importantly that it is not only his fault. It is mine as well. I hate the TheoClub as it is now. I don't want any part of it. It makes me cry and that's not right. I don't want any of the sarcastic ""O poor you"" comments. Shut up you bitches you don't know anything about what I feel. I'm sad to let go of it, because it was such a big part of my life, but I know in the long run I will feel free of burden and it will be better for everyone. I'm biting my lip because I'm kinda scared. I still try to be active in the club, but I really honestly don't want any part of the exec board. I don't have any dislike for the people on it, but all together we make a ticking time bomb and I would much rather hang with people who can love and appreciate me for me. I don't want to be brought down, or disliked. The people in the club make me feel like that. They may not mean to but they do. Especially Vince. Usually, now, I have an honest dislike for the kind of person he is. That makes me so sad, but it is the way things have to be. I want to focus on my schoolwork, my job, and my friends. That is all I really need right now. Everything else is unnessecary stress. Fuck that shit! I'm a much better and happier person without it. Sure being TheoClub President is important to me, but it's not everything. I'm okay without it. I'm okay, finally, without Vince. I'm even okay knowing that my family cannot give me what I need right now. I have always defined family in the following way, taking care of you when you're sick, eating meals together, talking things out even when you're busy, and joking around making fun of each other in play. Well indeed, my friends have done all of those for me. Right now my mom can't be the best for me. She only causes me stress. So I'll rely on my friends to be my family. And they can rely on me. They take care of me, I take care of them. Anything else, doesn't really matter. Besides school... I'm off to my night class.

"event","Right now I just feel like updating. There is no real method to my maddness I just really want to write. Sometimes people confuse me. Actually a lot of times people comfuse me. They say one thing and mean another. Like take a certain person on campus for instance. This girl writes pages and pages complaining about something she says doesn't exist, and yet almost cries when people talk about it! I have friends on campus who cut themselves, and yet when I have done it, they call a counselor on me. I am not refusing their help by any means. In fact, as many of you know, I am very grateful for those 5 people who have been my reason for waking up each day this past week. This has been an incredibly hard semester for me. It has been one thing after another. My hands are shaking a little as I write this because I'm trying to justify why all of this bad stuff has happened. I don't think I ever can. At the beginning of the school year, after Vince and I broke up, and I wanted him back really bad, I said, ""He would appreciate me, if something bad happened."" I am living proof of the old adage, ""Be careful what you wish for; you just might get it."" And by the way even with all the bad stuff, we never reconnected, in fact, at the moment, I feel sorry for him. I lost his friendship, but I gained the friendship of people much more worthy of mine, than him. He will remain to be a puppy dog following around girls who are unattainable his entire life. I would love to be his friend, I still think he is an amazing person, but I know that it's not worth it. Through all the bad stuff there has been glimers of hope that have shined throughout the darkness. I have really realized that even though, most times, I can't stand Dominican, and that usually people let me down, and that I really can't trust most people, there are a few, a small group who I can trust. It took me a very long time to be able to trust Dom, and Vince, and some others who have recently proven otherwise. With these five people I know right off the bat I can trust them. They are the most real, genuine, sweet, and kind people I have ever met. It has indeed been a rainy year in the life of Lauren Amore. I have lost, and been hurt a lot. I have been ready to give up many times. I can tell you that I have laughed more in the past week than I have in the past year. Even though within this group there is drama, there is laughter. We are able to put it aside and sit for a thanksgiving dinner. I have never had a thanksgiving dinner with my friends. I have never had someone say they were grateful for me. I have never had someone say I was a good person before. When I was with Vince I always felt like I was playing catch up. With my friends right now, I feel like we are all equal. I am troubled by gossip, rumors, and operas (lol) on campus, but I know at the end of the day (or beginning) there will be those people who I can say ""Fuck it all!"" with and just be myself. I don't have to be Miss Perfect Theology Major, Miss Perfect Daughter, Miss Perfect Slut, Miss Perfect Sister, Miss Perfect Worker, or Miss Perfect anyting. These people, my people, accept me as I am. I don't think they realize what they have done for me in the past week. I have thanked them time and time again. I need to do it again. I would be lost without their smiles and jokes. Without their hugs. Without the ability to call one of them at 3:00am and say, ""I need you."" and have them come running. I have said time and time again ""I have never had true friends."" ""I have never known real friendship."" It has only been a week and a half most people would say that is too quick to judge a friend. I say, if your still not sure about someone in a week, than it's no good. I have spent more time with these people, than I have most. In the back of my head the others I have ever been friends with I have always doubted. I have never been able to truly be myself around. It is different with them. I can love God, and still love to fool around. I can love my mom, and still hate her.I can talk during an entire movie, and critize everything about it except the cute guys, and have someone just sit with me, even though it's their favorite movie! I can laugh one minute and cry the next. No one will question me, no one will ridicule me. I can sit back, relax, and be myself. I am able to scream in the car and tell them to shut the fuck up. And have them say no, and then laugh at me. Us girls can sing Mariah Carey's ""All I want for Christmas"" at the top of our lungs and not have the boys run screaming. (Ok we were in a car! But they weren't complaning about our singing!) We girls can make fun of the guys, and yet they know we think the world of them. I can know that no matter what I have three guys waiting to protect me at any cost. (After they sell us to the mean bikers of course!) Friendship is truly an amazing feeling, and I just want to let Mary Lee, Adam, Brad, Tom, and most of all Meaghan know that I would not be here if it wasn't for you all. So when I say thank you, I mean it. Ok I'm going to get going now, I'm sorry for this rant on friendship everyone, it's just that sitting in the Clock Lobby watching the world go by, and relfecting on what's good in your life is something I like to do. When I did it, for the first time, I only thought of my friends. For the first time, it's okay to be going to Hollyball with 3 guys. (GO ME!!!) and two other girls. There will be nothing like it. For the first time, I can say there is a glimer of happiness inside of me, and it is all because of you guys. Thank you.

""EEWWWWWW WHAT?!?!?!?!""
""It's cocnut and it's Brad's fault!""

Then we went to Wedny's for lunch and ran into the boys coming in!! So we had Wendy's and then decided that it would be fun to pick up Mary Lee. So we all piled in my car. Me driving, Tom in front. Meaghan and Brad in the back. We were early so we went to my house. I said something stupid. Everyone laughed at me as usual. We ventured on to Mary Lee's house where her parents were oh so welcoming. I wish I had parents like that!! We all piled into my car and drove back to DU. I yelled at the dummies in the back. Tom yelled at me b/c he doesn't like my driving and he's a passenger driver!!! We ""fought"" for a lil and Mary Lee said ""Oh are mommy and daddy fighting!"" that shut everyone up. 

We came back here and had a fantabulous Thanksgiving dinner together. Then Adam came over and we all hung out in my room. It was awesome. There was a lot of laughing. There was also a really good talk to with Tom. (thank you!) Then Adam, Meaghan. Mary Lee, and Brad decided to make a tent on the futon while they all sat on it. Tom and I were lying on the bean bag and we felt left out. They wouldn't even talk to us!Then we decided at 1:00am to go get food at IHOP. Now the onyl two IHOP by us are the only two in the entire fucking world that aren't open 24hrs!! There were six people in my tiny care. Hummel and I up front and the boys in back with Mary Lee on top of them! It was great! Nothing was open we after trying a bizillion places, decided to go to good ol' wendy's. Mary lee had to get out of the car in order for the boys to reach their wallets so she sat on the curb while we went through the drive through. We got food. We were happy. We came back here and ate it. So we hung out a bit more. Then I kicked Tom in the balls. It was an accident. There was a lot of laughing and making fun. Thank you Thank you Thank you! you guys are the best. Happy Thanksgiving!

"event","Ok so while overall thanksgiving was not too bad. I'm still ready ot head back to good ol' DU. My mom and I are already getting on each other's nerves. I literally just got out of bed by the way. (Tom you think your bad with your 12:30!) I went to bed at 12:00 by the way. I slept for 13 hours!!! It was absolutly fantastic! So last night after a little fight with the family and some weirdness. I talked to Meaghan online, she's acting weird lately, but whatev. Mary Lee and I talked a bunch of times. And B-rad and I talked a million and 2 times. He and I have the same views about being home... we don't want to. Finally Mary Lee came over because I was feeling friend deprived. Courtney came over to to borrow my red dress to wear to her semi formal. Then when they all left I talked to B-rad some more. He decided to call me at 11:30 and we chatted on the phone about how much we miss school and each other... blah blah blah. That kid cracks me up. I really do miss him, and Tom. So we hung up around 12:00 with the promise that if for some unknown reason he decides to head back to school tomorrow night he would call me because I will gladly head back with him!! Okay well it's 1:00pm and I should be doing some laundry and making out some Christmas lists of what I am going to buy people.
I have to buy for...
Mom
Dad
Joey
Meaghan
Mary Lee
Tom
B-rad
Courtney
and I sincerly believe that's it. The roommates are all taken care of already. I think I know what the family is getting too. Well mom is fairly easy to shop for. Dad not so much, but I think amybe a nice scarf or something. For when he goes to work in the mornings. Joey is getting a gift certificate. If anyone has any ideas on anyone else please please please comment!!! I am so lost!!!

"event","This is the question that we have been studying with our Sunday night HS small group, over the past month or so. But, before one can begin to answer that question, we must first ask, what is a disciple? 

We came up with a list of attributes that might describe a disciple:

-loving, selfless, others-centered, caring, serving, bold, willing, consistent, focused on Christ.

We recognized that the life of a disciple may be:

-rewarding, costly, an ongoing process, dangerous, uncomfortable, humbling, exciting.

The relationship between a disciple and God could be described as:

-master/servant, trust, dying to self, pursuing God, obedience, rabbi/student, imitation. 

But (and this was my favorite part) can a person be a disciple and not have attained these attributes? What is the basic requirement for disciple-dom? After much discussion, this is what we came up with:

""A person who has chosen to pursue Jesus, to submit to His will, and to develop a Christlike character.""

That's pretty good. And challenging. 

I realized that though I've been a Christian since 17 and I liked going to church, I don't think I was truly a disciple until about the age of 21. It took me that long to realize that I held responsibility for my own growth in the faith. I couldn't rely on a pastor to feed me - I had to pursue Jesus myself. I chose to submit to God's will as a standard response - not on a case by case basis (what freedom this choice brings!). 

A large reason for this turning point in my life was the fact that I began to disciple others - and I realized that I wasn't living out myself what was expected of the youth being discipled. I could have given up, but I decided to rise to the challenge, and that's when my faith truly became my own, a living, growing, exciting, vibrant faith. 

It's kind of sad to me that in our culture, we have these different 'levels'. So many people believe they are Christians simply because they believe in God. The really 'good' people go to church every Sunday, right? But to pursue a relationship with Jesus, a Christlike character, to submit to His authority, that's Jesus Freak territory reserved for those unfortunate souls called into ministry and missions! Yikes! 

The thing is, I don't think God ever intended it to be that way. He wants a relationship with us. I don't think He expects us to be perfect. But He does want us to pursue Him... an adventurous pursuit that will lead us to a life we never believed possible! 

So I'll ask you again... are you a disciple?"

Something I overheard at lunch today sort of stuck with me. 

I was sitting in a popular downtown pizzeria, the kind that gets pretty crowded during the lunch hour, doing a little reading and keeping to myself. Now, I'm not one to eavesdrop on someone else's conversation, but in a crowded restaurant, when you're shoulder-to-shoulder with the next table over, sometimes you can't help it. 
           That was me.
Without really trying to listen, I noticed the two men at the table next to mine were discussing a recent trip one of them had taken to Australia.  Specifically, they were talking about a place called Ayers Rock.  It's a huge monolith out in the Australian wilderness, a place of great spiritual significance for the Aboriginal people.  Some believe it is the largest single rock on earth.  

The tourist told of his visit there, and how his guide had talked at length about the first time he climbed nearly 1000 feet to the top.  This was the interchange as I heard it:

""The guy said that when he got to the top, he just looked out over the plains, and it just knocked the air right out of his chest.  It was just so beautiful, and so powerful. He said he was moved to pray, like, eight or nine times in the couple of hours he spent up there.""

""Wow!  That sounds like a pretty amazing thing to see.  So did you go up to the top?""

""No, we didn't.  But doesn't it sound like it would be a great thing to do?""

Here was a man who had stood at the foot of this great rock and heard a first-hand account of how powerful and amazing it was to stand on top of it, and then declined the opportunity to hike up and see the breathtaking vista for himself.  And yet, when he got back home, he was perfectly content with telling his friend of the adventure he could have had.

I wonder how often we do this very same thing in the Christian life. We read accounts of the apostles, of the church fathers, of faithful heroes of old who beheld the miracles of God and changed the course of history. We read the biographies of Mother Teresa, Charles Spurgeon, and Billy Graham, and we marvel at the lengths they've gone to in touching lives and winning souls for Christ . We hear first-hand accounts from missionaries that come to visit our churches of the things God is doing today, in our own generation, in places like Africa and China where the church is going through an explosive revival.  

And we say to ourselves, ""Wow, that sounds pretty amazing, but I don't want to see it for myself. I'll just take your word for it.""  And maybe, if it's really impressive, we tell our friend over lunch what we heard, content to pass on the story of what someone else did for God's glory, as if it somehow vicariously makes us more holy.
Well not me.  I'm not going to settle for hearing the story of someone else's adventure with Christ. I'm not going to take someone else's word for it when they tell me what it's like to live a life completely devoted to God's purposes. The Holy Spirit who works through them is the same One who lives inside of me, so why shouldn't I dare to do radical things for the cause of Christ?

You can keep the comfortable little life you've made for yourself. You can tell your friends stories of what God is doing through others, if that's how you want to spend your time.
But I won't live your vicarious spiritual life.
I'm going to climb the rock and take a look at the view.
I want to see it for myself.</div>"

"event","<div align=justify>Just this weekend, I heard a sermon that touched on this topic. 

Take a look at what Paul says in Acts 17:24-27:24

""The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. 
 25   And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else.
 26   From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. 
 27   God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.""

God isn't served by human hands.  He was accomplishing His purposes long before any of us existed, and He will continue to do so forever.  He doesn't need us.

This is offensive to our pride, isn't it?  What do you mean God doesn't need me?  I'm a good servant.  I'm useful and productive.  God's lucky to have me on His team.   

I pray that God would take puffed-up, arrogant thoughts like these and rip them from my heart.  Lord, may I never entertain the notion that You can't accomplish your purposes without me.  May I remain Your humble and obedient servant.</div>"

"event","I really wanted to post something about youth ministry today, since the topic has been eating up so much of my energy and thinking as of late. Since I joined LaKeisha's church I have been helping with the youth. Our junior high youth group to be exact.""Alive and Awake,"" just started up this week, featuring a four-week curriculum written by yours truly, with heaping helpings of...well...help from LaKeisha. In addition to that, I've been helping out with our church's high school youth group following the loss of our youth pastor. So, between the two, there's much to plan for and participate in.  And while I take on these duties with great joy and a sense of God's calling in my life, they also tend to give me a headache. Why? Because I'm continually thinking about youth ministry. What are we doing? Why are we doing it?  What can we do to improve?
and when I am not working with the kids I'm in class studying the same subject.

In an effort to focus these thoughts and quiet my soul a little, I had intended to post a deep and thoughtful treatise on some particularly important aspect of youth ministry.

That was my intention, anyway.

The problem is, my thoughts won't line up. They refuse to be categorized and shaped into something coherent. I'm left with a sort of mental fruit salad, when what I really wanted was to float all the fruit in a nice, orderly Jell-O Mold, with little nuggets of fruity truth evenly spaced throughout.

Oh well. If a sort of controlled chaos is good enough for our junior high group, it's good enough for this post. Here are some things I've been thinking, in no particular order, with no particular point. You're welcome to them.

1.  Good youth ministry is built on relationships, not programs.

Having cool youth events to which kids flock in droves may look impressive, but true life change happens because students forge relationships with adult leaders and each other. Through these relationships, our students begin to see what a life lived in Christ looks like, and the difference Jesus makes in our lives. It's important for us leaders to show our kids everything, even the places where we are struggling ourselves, lest they come away with an inaccurate picture of the faith as being a cure-all for the trials and challenges commonly known as ""life.""  If these kinds of relationships aren't happening, we may draw a crowd, but we completely miss the point of doing so.

2. You have to build from the students you have.

What I mean by this is, you can't develop a healthy youth ministry through recruitment. At some point, you have to come alongside the kids you have already, helping them to take the next steps in their journey o' faith. You must assess where your kids are in their relationship with God (or lack thereof), and then keep them in mind as you develop your programs and activities. Teaching non-Christian kids to live out their faith doesn't work. Having an alter call for your Christian kids doesn't work, either. You need to know where your flock is spiritually, and what they need to hear to take those next steps. Disciple the kids you have, and numerical growth will take care of itself.

3. Youth ministry is not for everyone, but it's for more people than you think.

You don't have to be young and athletic and out-going to be a youth worker. The fact of the matter is, all types of people can be good youth workers: introverts, computer nerds, artsy types, etc. Why? Because kids come in all those varieties, too. Do you think the young blonde surfer-guy youth pastor is going to reach the quiet 7th grader with the thick glasses and the bad asthma? Maybe he will, but I'd rather have a nerdy volunteer youth leader on hand who speaks the kid's language and understands what he's going through. (aka ME)

Now, the people who make lousy youth workers are the ones who are in it to prove something. It's about them more than it is about the kids. They're more interested in the size of the youth group than they are in seeing Jesus change their students' lives. That's bad for the health of the ministry, and bad for the kids.

4. Good youth workers are profoundly weird people.

They have to be. Think about it. You remember being a teenager, right? You remember all the things about being a teenager that make you cringe at what a nerd / jerk / snob / dork / brat / whatever you were, right? Okay, now multiply that times twenty and imagine spending your free time with it. That's a pretty weird thing to do, right?

And yet we youth workers do it, and we do it with joy and enthusiasm, and we come back for more. Why? Because we're called to. We know the deep satisfaction that comes only with answering God's calling. We know the joy of seeing a teenager in the midst of discovering who they really are and who they can be in Christ. Better yet, we know the joy of discovering it along with them. Multiply THAT times twenty, and you'll see why youth ministry is worth it."

"event","I didn't introduce the group I'm leading and also some of my friends and family...so I'll do that now so you know who I am talking about next time around:

1. Noah, Yours Truly - I always marvel that I sound like I sound, and yet people still take me seriously.

2. LaKeisha - My girlfriend. We've only been together 2 months (I met her last year) but we have really combined our lives. She invited me to her church which I loved the first service. She only lives 3 streets away from me so we spend most of our free time together. She is 24 and has a huge heart for God. She is very open about her faith. The 3rd week we went to church together she told me the youth group needed a assistant part time  youth worker on very short notice. I didn't think I could do it because I hadn't even become a member yet. But I signed up anyway. 2 weeks later the senior youth pastor leaves the church for personal reasons that were never explained to anyone. I am temporarily running the youth group with the help of LaKeisha.  

3. Michael - Our group comedian. He's 14, and we call him Random Man. Trust me, he's earned the moniker.

4. Datonae - he's 14 talks only about sports. He's new to the group

5. Stacy - she helps with the youth group sometimes. Don't let her soft-spoken demeanor deceive you. She's tough. 

6. Mikayla - she's 12, going on 18. I've decided I'm just going to let her teach our Youth Group lessons from now on. You'll see what I mean.

7. Josh - He's 12 as well. I'm so proud of Josh because of his openness to try new things and listen to God's voice. He's an awesome young man.

8. Kelley - Though she's 16, she has one of the deepest souls of anyone I know. The journey that God is leading her on fills me with joy whenever I think about it.  Hers is a powerful voice for Christ. Don't miss it.

9. LaToya - She's very straight forward and tough but she speaks openly about her faith if you want her to or not. 

10. Mercedes - She's 13...a little distant but I think she's coming around.

11. Antonae - He's 14...the little rebel, he is new like me.

12. Jerome - Very competitive ""ladies man"" and only 12!

13. Ayla - She's 12, and she's the ""aged"" voice of reason on our team. Ayla doesn't speak much, but when she does, she tells it like it is. I love that about her.

14. Sara - she's 22. she's not in the youth group she is a friend of mine from back home in VA. She's a big support for me and  a strong christian. 

15. Eric - he's 26. he's my roomate. We share a house together on the edge of Decatur/Atlanta. I'm sorry to say I don't think I will be rooming with him for too much longer because of my trip back to Blacksburg for the summer. Oh I almost forgot. he's crazy.

16. Brandon - He's 15. My Brother who lives back in Blacksburg with my mom. He's become distant in the last 2 years. He is definatly a clown. But sometimes I think he is very sad. He's a little crazy but he's a good kid. 

17. Alissa - she 20. Lives down my street. She's my ex girlfriend. We were only together 2 months and ended up splitting when we realized how much our beliefs on mostly moral issues were completely different. 

18. Icee my 5 year old wolf mix.

19. My father. Last time I heard from him I was 17. He's an abusive alcoholic. I'm very thankful he is out of me and my brother's lives. 

20. Mike - he's 22. he's my cousin. He's going to school at WVU. He lives between Roanoke, VA and Scotch Plains, NJ. We are very close.

21. Kristine - She's 20. She's my cousin and Mike's sister."

I've never heard about, much less seen, such a consistent and tangible show of support to ministry leaders. Though I've never doubted that this is the place that God has called us to minister, it is so affirming to see that the congregation is just as happy to have me here! (LaKiesha has been a member for 7 years, I for less than 4 months) You don't know how much it means to both of us. So, on behalf of LaKiesha and myself, thank you so very, very much."

The events of the last month and a half have propelled me into a very different place in life, a place of radical dependence on God and daily spiritual battle. This is the place where my faith is tested, where the rubber hits the road. This is where my heart gets broken, and molded, and reshaped to be more like the heart of my Savior.  This, my friends, is ""Go Time."""

"event","I started a new devotional this morning. It's a book entitled <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0310259916/qid=1128623090/sr=8-4/ref=pd_bbs_4/002-7144822-3007233?v=glance&s=books&n=507846"">Enjoy the Silence, by Duffy and Maggie Robbins</a>. It's a beginner's guide to a centuries-old practice called lectio divina, a method of reading Scripture, praying, meditating, and journaling intended to help its practitioner to quiet the mind and listen for the voice of God.

My experience this morning was terrific. It was a meditation on the Parable of the Sower, as told in <a href=""http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%208:4-15;&version=31;"">Luke 8:4-15</a>. For those unfamiliar with the story (and too lazy to click the link and read it), Jesus uses the image of a farmer sowing seed to represent the word of God being proclaimed. Each type of soil describes a different type of heart among the hearers of God's word.  Really, you should just click the link and read the whole thing.

Anyway, getting back to my meditation this morning. Very simply, I read the passage repeatedly, slowly, picturing in my mind each of the soil types that Jesus describes. The path, worn down and unreceptive, with seeds bouncing off of it, waiting for the birds to take them away. The rocky soil, where strong roots cannot develop and take hold, causing young plants to wither and die. The soil of thorns, which chokes out anything trying to grow. And finally, the good soil, the place where the seed is retained and nurtured, growing a strong and healthy plant and a bountiful crop.

As I turned my attention to my own heart, I expected to find it much like the good soil: healthy, fertile, ready to receive God's word, ready for it to take root and produce fruit in my life. But as I reflected on it, I found something quite different. The soil of my heart had once been healthy, yes, but now it was damaged. It had been dried out and scorched by the intense heat of labor and burden. It had been trampled down by disappointment, as other people in my life walked all over it. Weeds of distraction and discontent and idolatry had sprung up in a few places. This was a soil in need of restoration.

And then, in a prayer of imagination, I saw the great Gardener reach down into the soil of my heart, breaking up the clods and clumps with His bare hands. He turned the dried soil, adding much-needed water and nutrients. He pulled the weeds, though it was clear that I have a responsibility to do some weed-pulling myself (with His help, of course).

The result of all this was that I ended up spending an hour with the Lord this morning. During that time, He pointed out some things in my heart, He refreshed and replenished me, and He prompted me to pray for specific students in our youth group. But more than anything else, I came to the re-realization that God is the only one who can restore my heart. When my heart is hurting, lonely, or even broken, I can -- I must -- turn to God for comfort and healing. 

And so must we all."

"event","<div align=justify>I want to wish a happy Thanksgiving to everyone out there. I hope you're spending it with friends and family, and that everyone is healthy and happy.  
I also want to throw a little thought I've been rolling around for a while out there for you to chew on. I'll probably post on this topic again after I've had more time to mull it over myself, but here's the gist of it.
At various times during the year, and on Thanksgiving especially, we Americans reflect on the abundance of blessings God has bestowed upon us. We think about having all the food we could ever want and a roof over our heads, and for most of us the list of blessings extends far, far beyond that. New homes, new cars, boats, iPods, and X-Box 360's, and new jobs with higher salaries to pay for it all. 
We interpret these things as blessings from the Lord, a confirmation of His generosity, and His high opinion of our nation. We receive these blessings, convinced that God wants nothing more than for us to enjoy them and be happy. But what if there's another interpretation? 
""From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.""  -- Luke 12:48
""He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need.""  -- Ephesians 4:28
""Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.'""  -- Matthew 25:41-43
It's just a thought.  
Happy Thanksgiving!</div>"

"event","The Constant Gardener - movie, 2 stars


In The Constant Gardener, Ralph Fiennes plays a widower who must unravel the mystery and conspiracy that ultimately led to his wife's brutal off-screen murder. Sounds intriguing enough on paper, but unfortunately the experience of the film is anything but.

The film opens with British mid-level diplomat Justin Quale (Fiennes) receiving the news that his wife, Tessa (Rachel Wiesz), has been killed. His understated, very British, stiff-upper-lip-type grief shows itself in Fiennes eyes, even as he thanks his informant for his bravery in revealing the news. We see that this is a man for whom restraint is paramount, a potentially interesting title character.

Unfortunately, that potential is shattered almost immediately as we flashback to the couple's first meeting. The restrained diplomat is reading a lecture on behalf of his absent boss. As he concludes, a student Tessa takes the opportunity to rip into him, demanding an explanation of the UK's involvement in Iraq. She is a pitbull, filled with the fire of liberal outrage and contempt. To some, she will seem a brave and spunky hero. To me, she seemed a grating, self-righteous bore. But to all, it will become apparent that Tessa overpowers and overshadows the man who will become her husband from the very start. This is a problem, because it renders the couple neither believable nor compelling. You almost get the sense, as harsh as it may sound,  that he's better off without her.

The plot, much of which is told through flashback, revolves around Tessa's efforts to use her marriage to expose a conspiracy between large drug companies and the British government to use AIDS-ravaged Kenyans as lab rats for testing experimental drugs. After her snooping gets her killed, Justin begins to investigate her work, which she has kept secret from him all this time. In taking up her cause, he learns who his wife really was, and that she did truly love him. 

Again, this sounds pretty good on paper. But the execution leaves much to be desired, with countless character names, unclear plot points, and not one but two secret letters convoluting the narrative from start to finish. Further, Fiennes' milquetoast diplomat is fine as the grieving widower or the hen-pecked husband, but he makes a lousy spy. When the film focuses on him unravelling Tessa's mystery, it bogs down considerably.

Now, there are many things about this film that are quite admirable. Brazillian director Fernando Meirelles demonstrates a great degree of visual artistry in the variety of his shot selections and editing.  He is obviously adept at using focus and framing to shape the audience's experience of his characters and setting. Speaking of which, Kenya provides the film with a vibrant backdrop of sights and sounds. The beauty of the nation and her people are on full display.

But technical proficiency and a compelling location do not a good film make. And this is not a good film. This is a preachy, self-righteous fantasy of the Left about exposing corporate evil. It leaves its audience looking for a hero, with a choice between an irritating shrew and her maddeningly submissive husband.

Maybe it doesn't look so good on paper after all."

"event","According to this article in today's Ventura County Star, public health advocates are proposing two new initiatives that would add $2.50 in new taxes to the price of cigarettes, nearly doubling the price to $6 per pack. The basis of their argument is that there has been less tax money coming in over the last couple of years, in part due to more people giving up the habit. This ""jeopardizes"" the programs that those taxes fund. 

Now, I'm not a smoker. I'm a former smoker. (clean 2 years) I  have smokers in my family.

But, for Pete's sake, someone has to stand up and say, ""This is not right."" It's a clear case of tyranny of the majority. Because smokers only make up about 20% of the adult population in Virginia, we can tax them into oblivion and they can't fight back. 

Current tobacco taxes are used to fund things like preschool programs and indigent healthcare. These proposed new taxes would fund emergency rooms and other health and education programs. Why should 20% bear the burden of paying for services enjoyed by a much wider swath of our population? 

Because we can make them, and they can't stop us.

But there are two things they can do to avoid the new taxes: quit, or go underground. Indeed, many smokers have quit in recent years, which is good news for them and their loved ones. But I think the falling tobacco tax revenues have a lot more to do with underground and out-of-state sales than people quitting smoking. Why would I pay $6 per pack when I can buy from the internet for $2.50? Or take a drive to Reno or Vegas and load up the trunk with cheap cigarettes? These increased taxes are going to push more people underground. And what will happen when tax revenues fall again? You guessed it. Even higher taxes.

What really kills me about the ""ultra-compassionate"" left-wingers pushing for these tax increases is that they're the same people who are always worried about the impact of any new policy on ""the working poor."" They bemoan the fact that the working poor can't pay for healthcare, and the working poor can't afford to adequately prepare their kids for school. 

Who do you think makes up the largest percentage of addicted tobacco users? Millionaires? No, it's the working poor. So, if these taxes are enacted, literally millions of the poor will have to find room in their family budgets to pay twice as much for cigarettes. Why isn't the Left concerned about the impact that will have on school readiness or healthcare affordability?

It just infuriates me that liberals are willing to exploit the addiction of millions of Virginians to pay for their pet programs.  Yes, emergency rooms are important, but forcing a small minority of the population pay for them just because you can is discriminatory, pure and simple."

Thought it was good enough to repost!

""A guy wrote this in his myspace. and it should make you think.

Stop being so.............. yourselves. I know way too many really beautiful girls who think they don't look good... It hurts... because it's our fault, guys I mean. We make girls feel like they have to be perfect. You know what I mean, flat stomach, huge boobs, round ass, long legs, big lips, and on top of all that, they have to dress like a .........., and be one as well... nobody can measure up to that... and its not fair... because nobody should have to. The little imperfections are what make people special. If everyone was perfect the world would be so boring, variety is what makes life interesting. So guys, stop making girls have to live up to your expectations, I'm sorry, our... deluded fantasy visions of perfection. Stop acting like boys and start being men... realize that women don't exist to fufill our sexual desires. Stop talking to them solely to get with them, be nice to them because you want to be their friend, not because you want to hook up with them. Say nice things about them not to flatter them in hopes that you'll get some, but because you know they like to hear them. In short... we need to grow up and stop being dicks... just because we have them doesn't mean we need to think with them.

If you agree that this is true repost this to get the message through to others.""

I just put this up on my journal too because I see a lot of truth in this, especially from the country I come from..."

"event","This last weekend I went down to Decatur, Georgia to check out the University I have been looking at to attend this fall. It's a nice campus and I have to make my decision if I am going to attend in the next month. The only thing that is holding me back is my family &amp; friend who lives here in Virginia, and in New Jersey. It would be very hard for me to visit them during the year on the finances I have right now. I am going to miss everyone so much. Is it worth it? Is this where God is sending me?"

"event","I finally saved enough to get me a decent car. I've been driving a 1990 acura for 2-3 years and it's about to die on me. So I pulled my car savings together (about 2 years worth)and got a 1998 Toyota Avalon XLS! It came with nice rims, cd player and leather interior. Private dealer. 5800$... which is pretty good. might not sound like a dream car but it's luxury to me! I love it. I'll have pictures of it up pretty soon. This is really a godsend"

"event","I should of updated this things ages ago... my computer crashed a while ago when I downloaded a song from napster which turned out to be a virus... completely crashed my computer... finally got it into the shop in december got it back. paid almost 200$ to get the new windows and 10 more GB.
It's running fine now though. I am still working as a Janitor and still living at home...But not for long. Mom.. now that she is financially stable told me she doesn't need my help with the bills or anything so she told me I have 3 months to find a new place to live... so the search begins...
House or apartment? live alone or with a roomate? put the 15,000 I have saved up into a house, newer car, towards rent... do i use that money that I had saved for college? would it be better just to go to a community college and get twice the classes for the money? 
These are the questions that have been running in my head lately..."

I was trying to explain that the computer probably had a porn virus on it that was putting up the ad's but instead I told her it probably had a ""sexually transmitted disease""! I don't know why I mixed those up but she looked at me like I was crazy. I laugh about it now but at the time I was so embarrassed."

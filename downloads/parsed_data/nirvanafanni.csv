Kelly: Slow down. Im scared. 
Sam: No this is fun. 
Kelly: No its not. Please, its too scary! 
Sam: Then tell me you love me. 
Kelly: Fine, I love you, but slow down! 
Sam: Now give me a BIG hug. 
(Kelly hugs him)
Sam: Can you take my helmet off & put it on yourself? Its bugging me. 

(In the paper the next day):
...A motorcycle crashed into a building last night because of brake failure. Two people were involved, a male and a female, but only 1 survived. The truth was that halfway down the road, the 18 year old boy realized that his brakes had broke, but he didn't want to let his partner know. Instead, he made her say she loved him and felt her hug one last time, and let her wear his helmet so that she would live, realizing he would be the one that would die."

I try to breathe
Memories overtaking me
I try to face them but
The thought is too much to conceive

I only know that I can change
Everything else just stays the same
So now I step out of the darkness
that my life became 'cause

I just needed someone to talk to
You were just to busy with yourself
You were never there for me
To express how I felt
I just stuffed it down
Now I'm older and I feel like
I could let some of this anger fade
But it seems the surface I am scratching
Is the bed that I have made

So where were you?
When all this I was going through
You never took the time
To ask me just what you could do

I only know that I can change
Everything else just stays the same
So now I step out of the darkness
that my life became 'cause

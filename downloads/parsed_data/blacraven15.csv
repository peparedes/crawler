"event","Another day gone, April first is getting closer...:)

I have to register for classes tommorrow morning for my Summer session at PSU. I guess Im going to college on the 19 of June now. Im going to do a six day backpacking trip through PSU. It is a six day class that will get me two of the three credits I need as a an undergrad.... talk about me doing the least amount of work to get the most credits;) Then on the 26 I start college. 

Tennis tryouts start tommorrow, so we will see how they go... I have only hit twice in the last three weeks, where my competition has practiced about three days a week taking private lessons... My dad doesnt feel that its worth the money becaus eit is my last year and there is no future in it for me. Oh well, this year will be fun regardless because I want it to be. I figure my parents moved me my senior year, I should at least try to make the best of it. 

Did I mention that I have the best girlfriend in the world? :D Because I dont know if she knows it or not but, she has helped me through one of the hardest times in my life. I called noelle today because we were in teh same english class last year and I needed to know the name of this story we read so I could use it in teh speech Im writting. Anyways, it was a strained conversation at best, I talked with her dad first and they were like my adopted parents when I moved there. So everyhting was good when I talked to him, however I dont think I could ever talk to noelle again. It was just so forgien. Anyways, I used to think that she was willing to be there for me, but as soon as I moved it was like I never existed. However, Meghan after two years was willing to give me a chance and give me move support than noelle ever did. Meghan has put up with more in a relationship than most, and she loves me. Thats why she is the most wonderful girlfiend.

IT will soon be warm enough to go on a motorcylce ride!!!! I am really getting cabin fever. I have nothing to do inside, so once it gets warm I can just go ride when I have nothing else to do. It is gonna be great! Well, off to watch some tv with my parents before bed.

DISNEY WORLD + MEGHAN = THE PERFECT VACATION"

"event","Today was okay, it was my second to last day of tennis conditioning so I am definitely excited. I have a math test tommorrow on a chapter that I missed half the notes for... that will be fun.
I have to give a persuasive speech in speech class. It has to be a controversal topic, so I picked evolution vs. creation. As soon as I sadi my topic out loud everyone asked where I stood and half the class didnt my answer... So what do you think? Evolution and big bang? God created all? Or a mix of both, god created earth and man, but we have evolved over the years to what we are now? It would be neat to knwo where my friends stand on this:)

As to the situation with Lauren. For once I have no ideas on how to make it better. I mean I have her so mad at me that even if I do tell her a name I think she would still be mad because I didnt give in when she asked the first time... Know that your friends are just that, your FRIENDS and they would not use such methods to attack you. I mean, who wants to face your wrath, you are the best at being angry compared to anyone else I have ever known;) 

All I am doing is looking forward to florida... It's really the only thing to look forward to right now. Seeing Meghan is what I dream about at night. Though my relationship with ehr does kinda scare me. I mean, there is teh saying, never put all your eggs in one basket, Im definitely not taking that advice. If suddenly one day she decided that she didnt want to go out with me anymore, that it was to much of a hassle... well, Greta and I would be in the same boat. Ecxept that I know Meghan would not screw me over like Anthony did to Greta. I love Meghan, so much... and Florida is going to be a very, very good time;) *cough* *cough* Well, onto math."

"event","I have a friend who I care about deeply, but she feels I have betrayed her... I dont tell because I dont think it will help. 

Tennis conditioging is killing me...;) Luckly only two days are left. And in April Im going to disney world with Meghan. I cant wait! I want to spend the rest of my life with this girl... of course I am probably scaring her away. I'm not really big in writting in journals, but I am really bored and therefore here I am. 

I gave blood yesterday and passed out afterwards. I had to spend two hours laying down doing nothing before I was able to get up and go back to class. It was fun.... 

Everyone searches for happiness, and yet I think I realized something. You can never be completely happy. You can be happy about certain parts of of your life but never be happy about everything. The trick is to focus on the happy parts and try to forget the crappy parts. For example, getting used by a girl I thought really liked me, and then having her not even care that I was leaving. (Thats the crappy part) The good part is that a relationship between Meghan and I rekindled after two years, something I would have told you to be impossible. Becaus eof this my senior year went form the worst year of highschool to the best. Amazing how one event can make you forget every else and change your outlook on life... maybe thats why its so hard for lauren. But the only way to get over something bad to is to find something good. That something good for me, is Meghan. She has had a bigger effect on my life than she could ever have imagined. It is the first time I have ever been in love. And yet the future kinda scares me, its one of those I cant wait to meet it, but I cant help but think Meghan will find someone she cares more about, someone who can always be there in person and not over the phone. I could understand why this would happen, and all I can do is hope that I am really what she is looking for. But I want her to be happy so if someone better comes... I want her to choose happiness instead of feeling that she is tied to me. 
I guess I kinda am in a dark mood... it must just be this week. Oh well, tennis starts monday so I wont have time to think about these things.
I love you, and here I come life."

"event","that was probably one of the best pistons games i've ever watched, they were town 10-2 early but cam back on a 17-4 run to end the 1st quater up 21-41. it was a fuckin blow out from there. with the pistons winning 69-90

sorry i gotta laugh, their so called ""all star"" point gaurd Jason Kidd was scorelss the whole game and ""Mr Clutch"" Brian Scalibrine (sp?) missed his only feild goal attemp.

Big Ben Wallace came out strong w/ 18 points,8 rebounds and 2 blocks,the detroit back court (PG and SG) came out blazings hittin 7 of 14 3 point feild goals.  Chauncey finished the game w/ 22 points and Rip Hamilton finished w/ 21.

that was big d w/ ya sports report , keep it real flint"

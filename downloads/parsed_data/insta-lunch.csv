the wall falls all to piece,

the fly claps little violin tune licking proboscis tongue hunger at -

I could kill pinnochio but he said he can't die,

why try?

"event","So i sit here, eyes wavering maniacally from the clock in the lower right hand corner of the screen to the price chart for bulk turntables on my desk and i wonder: why am i doing this?

I JUST WANT TO FUCKING DRAW, PAINT, MAKE MUSIC, RAP, WRITE....that's it. 

the more i think about it, i don't even really want to be famous, i just want to be left the fuck alone and allowed to create things.  Is that too much to ask?  Is that somehow going to offend the Night Shepherds of Skeleton Lake? Not at all.  Will the Floating Children try to kill me for it? Not in the slightest.  Why CAN'T i just unhinge my jaw and swallow the world, damn you. Fhenrir did it.  Granted, he's alot bigger, corporeally, then i am, but still.  i want to.  Kind of.  A little. 

i tire of constant company. 
lets see how alone i can make myself. 
au revoir."

................................
Baby's breath romance, and a mother in girls wish to grow older,woman,
handcuffed to clear stiletto hopeful the pole dances around her..
twist of hair struts brunette, knows curl of blond, she's vapid
the worlds her mirror twirls hair in a figure eight lifes picture frame distracts
bliss is praise of a pale girl, whose skin is winter minus daddy's bruise...
while brown eye's blink sun set in tears of spread legs to birth the brats she knew,
now candle burnt the sun, i'm livid...
shit switched and laughters earned in blood, to pivot sad in ballerina place....
but pistol grip her handshake, 
show love in more than clutch fuck or dollar press in bra-strap
it's lady struck..so listen mad...to madame's freedom lace
this wedding seat displace of arrow, cupid, narrow, barely missed me
chocolate's as bitter sweet as victory in first kiss i gave Miss Me...
history of lip gloss god, she's pretty,
dead, to me, this city of old flowers and gray fog of tragic..
this baby's breath romantic haunts her everyday, flaunts herself but prays
for the empty space in the cradle that won't rock enough to stuff 
between her legs in front of camera...this bastard called her cunt until she posed, and now she's baby
and every breath's romantic..
so, lovely grasps for saturns rings on fingers brash, but handsome sings
bouquets of rose, gold lantern, unbalanced hammock swings
this flash of ratty leaves, this nest of sex what's never had to lean
on another..the last to breathe romantic...baby, ask for me...
.......................................

i don't think i like it all that much...but i will as the days move on and i realize that people love me for my candy alone...

i went Danielle Develasco's mothers house with my sister Lara.  It was quite the odd experience.  But hopefully it will yield positive results.

I will shoot Luke Hamilton in the face with a very large gun.  Thrice.

I took some very disconcerting pictures.  That is all."

^That is a journal. These things are nonsense. 

Where is the drama of voice played out in the moments between brilliance and the conversation turning awkward? Where is the interraction with your fellows? How drole is this endless typing and reading and responding? WhyWHYWHYWHYWHY?!?!?!

Because its...fun?

I have to wonder, do i actually enjoy this? It is easier to type, that is for sure, then to..say...bludgeon a person to death with a pair of very dull scissors.  I would enjoy the latter tremendously, but the former? Less effort, but considerably more brain is required to place each succinct thought into context with the one before it.

Journals are an oddity.

With an actual journal, there are all sorts of layers of subterfuge.  Journals are not meant to be read by others.  This is an invasion.  Journals are unnatural. There are locks and hiding places and secret codes and all sorts of scams devised solely for the purpose of concealment, and this website, this abomination of man, proudly displays your inner most desires and feelings to millions of complete strangers.

(I am aware of the security options, of the private pages that feed their owners sick narcisistic urges, using the tools of technological resource to construct outrageous mirror-pages for their eyes alone)

But...alas...
I'm going to die in four days.
I'm bitter.

"event","Yes, yes indeed. I feel like human waste product.

The anus of life has squeezed me out.  It covered me in phlegm and horrible little origami paper dolls.  I am a walking used jolly rancher.  My SUV has derailed, hit several small city monkeys, and completely flipped over. I am wiping out pedestrians.

I am sick.
Don't eat at Giordano's.
The Tropic Delight pizza made me yawn in technicolor. 
Boobs.
Large ones."

"event","The nature of a question,
how pale, how bowing out and lost in honor and a dignity that belongs with snakes afraid to shed,
pleasing, 
their, blows prettiness in winds of walk walk walk, sleep,
the resting of more than men know.

The naming of all your lady parts,
the labeling of blades of grass,
that cut and cut and cut.


the making of a difference.
the fear of being different.

"event","We drill into gravel roads, absentmindedly, caught between nets of flesh offal and matter, confined. You speak with your tongues licking our brothers backs, with the bodies we fill to the point of bursting, breathing us in. Your vision obscures. We tangle with eyelid lash, you walk, blind. Foolish. 

We whisper amongst winds which carry us through sewer, and gutter, and beneath natures hedge. We grow nothing and rest absolute. 

You need and want and we supply. Without us, you would be skin-rot and dried bone.

In your insolence you do not consider the slavery you enforce, do not think beyond your face reflected in a pool of water, beyond holding us in a bowl of urine and organic foulness.

Across catwalk bridges, behind steel bivouac, we will find you and cling to consume.

"event","I once had a pet sqirrel named picolo (This is true.  Things like this are far too odd not to be true).  Picolo died in a terrible car accident involving a nude beach and several bottles of whiskey.  Though the police report suggests that squirrels should not be behind the wheel of a car to begin with, let alone having downed 1 and 30 bottles of Jack Daniels, i believed Picolo's claim of ""just going out for hookers, be back in an hour"" was prophetic. 

Picolo's ghost appeared to me last night. 


In his astral form ( i noted the peculiar cliche hollow-ness as well as the tiny silver string connecting him to some great squirrel beyond )he began a very brief speech, a haiku, designed only for my ears.  I will write it below.


One, two, three, four, five,
one, two, three, four, five, six,shit
seven didn't fit



Picolo then laughed maniacally and burst into flames.

It was disturbing.

This is true."

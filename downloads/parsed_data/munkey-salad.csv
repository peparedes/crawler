I think in these past 4 weeks, i've been going through reverse PMS.
These content feelings are overwhelming.
I've been having bursts of creative energy, been working on a 
couple short films & an art gallery project, have been (and still am) 
traveling around everywhere and have realized how amazing it is 
to be surrounded by mature, understanding, caring friends who 
know you inside-out, love you and who will forever be on the same 
wave length as you are lol <3 

Though when you have so many things going for you then you hear 
that a handful of people you know are either going through depression,
having a bad time with their current home situation or/and just
having a tough time in life, you almost feel bad for them.

Depression sucks. I know because i get it once in a while.
It can take you to a dark place, though its easy to get out of...

I'm proud when people can get through the tough situations 
they go through with themselves.
But <b>NOT</b> proud when they have to do it with negativity and
have to mask the truth/reality of things that had happend to them.

Try not to say things to other people (when talking
about your depression) that aren't true just to get some form 
of pity out of them. There are always 2 sides to a story.

Things like that just don't help in the long run.
 

So for those of you that i've talked to over the past month who are 
suffering from tough times, my best advice is to: 
#1- Make sure you go out and get a change of scenery!

Staying in one place for too long can definitely make a 
depressing situation more painful than it should be.
Don't dig yourself in a never-ending dark hole.

CHANGE!

ie:

If you live with your parents: MOVE OUT! (Gaining some life experience is always a plus!)

If you're sick of your town: GO OUT AND TRAVEL FOR A MONTH!

If you hate your job: QUIT!/GET ANOTHER JOB!/GO TO SCHOOL!

If you just straight up hate your current life: GO OUT AND FIND YOURSELF!

Don't mope. Don't be immature. Don't look for pity.
Only you can help yourself <3

Acceptance is definitely they key to happiness if you can achieve that <u>without</u>
thinking/feeling/saying anything negative.


<b>Forgive, forget and move on.</b>


Everybody be happy; its almost summer! xo"

Damn the French influence in Laos for making my plain, yet delicious breakfasts 
so very much a necessary part of my week. 

<img src=""http://www.williams-sonoma.com/wsimgs/rk/images/rcp-images/Recipe/baguettes_bread.jpg"">

Its funny being back home.
Its actually weird for me NOT being surrounded by ancient ruins lol.
I wasn't even gone for that long yet looking out the window at shitty North America
looks so bizarre. Im not used to all this space and cleanliness! :P

So long post short, heres what we did:

1)<b>San Fran, USA</b>: 2 days (loved it)

2)<b>Bangkok, THAILAND</b>: around 3-4 days (fucking hate it there)

3)<b>Koh Chiang, THAILAND</b>: 3-4 days (A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.)

4)back to Bangkok to catch a train (*barf*)

5)<b>Vientiane, LAOS</b>: 3 days (3 words- I LOVE LAOS)

6)<b>Vang Vien, LAOS</b>: 2 days (god DAMN, how i love Laos!)

7)<b>Luang Prabang, LAOS</b>: 4 days (now i miss Laos)

8)2 day slow boat ride up the Mekong River (*hearts*)

9)<b>Chiang Rai, THAILAND</b>: 3 days (North Thailand is where its at)

10)<b>Chiang Mai, THAILAND</b>: 4 days (i rode an elephant here! &hearts;)

11)back to stinky fucking Bangkok >:(

12)<b>Siem Reap, CAMBODIA</b>: 2 days (the ruins of Angkor made me weeeeep!) 
http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/668/gallery/

*i started getting sick in Cambodia, so we had to start making travel arrangements to leave
one week early :(

13)<b>Phnom Pen, CAMBODIA</b>: 1 day (not that exciting. While i was sick on bed, Mike went out to get some food and was offered tons of sex from a pimp tuk-tuk driver. Then after he ate, he had a bad allergic reaction to the peanuts that were hidden in his food, so we pretty much spent that whole night in the hotel barfing together. How special &hearts;)

14)<b>Sihanoukville, CAMBODIA</b>: 1 day (there were places along the beach that offered normal food and then ""SPECIAL HAPPY"" food. Mike and i both ordered the ""SPECIAL HAPPY MILK SHAKE"" and ""SPECIAL HAPPY PIZZA"". Yes, it definitely got us completely fucking stoned for a good 18 hours straight :/

15)back once again to shitty Bangkok for an early flight back to BC.

I miss the heat, the mangos, the beach, the trannies, the cute-tanned-big-brown-eyed-children, the fresh pineapple shakes, dodging 4 inch cockroaches, the weird people we met, the crazy animals i saw, the $3 meals, waking up to roosters, getting offered sex and opium everywhere we went, sipping on coconuts, watching the geckos crawl up the wall, the night markets, the temples, the monks, the fried bananas, the hot babes, etc, etc, etc, etcccccc!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

All i have to say to anyone planning a trip there: go see Bangkok once, just to see it, 
and then avoid it as much as you can after that!! :P

k, sleepytime!

It was the Dinosaurs in Gastown exhibit @ Storyeum.
It really wasnt as great as i was hoping it would be
(comparing it to the exhibit in Victoria, it was pretty small)
But i still had fun dragging Nera everywhere with me :D

The best was the life-size animatronic T-Rex.
There was a show going on hosted but this lame ""safari"" dude.
At the end of it he said ""and behind this curtain is a LIVE T-REX!,
but dont worry, hes all locked up."" And then of course the sirens go 
off, the power goes out and the man screams, ""OH NO HES LOOSE!""

The curtain came down and out came Mr. Life Size Animatronic T-Rex.
One kid had to leave, a couple were screaming and i think the rest were 
all bawling their eyes out lol It was the funniest thing ive seen
all year \m/ Nera and i were in the back peeing our pants hahaha

^oh and this is Mr. Life Size Animatronic Triceratops, hanging out in 
a bad part of town :/

...and then we went out for lunch where i had a burger, fries and a milkshake
which ended in complete disgusting ILLNESSSSS. 

I had fun :)

I CANT STOP LAUGHING.
Its almost 2am; i just ran home in the rain all alone with my 
eyes closed and my arms out aS if i was an airplane about to take off
Hahahaaaaaaa
im sooo plastered right now i cant even think X*D***

I JUST SAW HORSE THE BAND AND HELLA AND DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN~ WWEEEEE!

I ran into like 176573652 people i knew, which never happens at shows i go to. why i dont make the effort to hang out with these people on my spare time? 
we'll never know. 
insanity!

Horse the Band was fabulous. Nera even bought their new album = (hell just froze over) LOL

I wept when Hella played. It was by far a WAY better performance than the last time i saw them. 
Seeing Hella live is probably the equivalent to what it must feel like when people have outer body experiences when theyre near death n' shit like that \m/\m/\m/\m/\m/\m/\m/\m/

We left before Dillinger came on but my seabus wasnt leaving for another half an hour, so i drug Nera back to the venue and we had a prairie fire (tequila & tabasco shots) :/ 
When we went back, i totally got my half signed Zach-Hill-less Team Sleep picture autographed lol It was bugging me for the past 5 years now; 
i had to do it.

id find some nice soothing classical music to help me fall asleep;
instead i came across an Art Bell radio show which kept me up for a
very loOoOong time. i got so scared i almost shat my pants- 
it was <u>AWESOME</u>.

I guess thats all i needed to get me back in the spirit of things >:)

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/campsign.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

<lj-cut text=""*"">

We left friday morning.
I went with Melissa, Daylon, Cassey, Adrianna, Chase, Kylie, Alex, some of their friends whos names i cant remember, 2 dogs and my little 16 year old cousin lol

The first night was TORTURE! It was soooo cold i couldnt even move. 
The weather man on TV is gonna get a beating from me for lying >:\
Besides the horrid weather, it was fun though. I havent been <i>'camping'</i> camping for almost 17 years (meaning camping without running water, sheltered eating areas, toilets etc...).

I shared a tent with Melissa. Everyone referred to it as ""Spirit Tent"" because of the way we decorated it and the non-stop Pink Floyd oozing from it all day \m/

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/insidetent.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

My chair :)

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/mychair.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

I never got to sit in it much though because it was soo, sooooo cold that we pretty much stayed in our tents for all of friday. 
I was trying to get a picture of Adrianna outside our tent but Daylon was being an idiot camera whore so i finally gave up trying after like, the 7th time.

My camera couldnt take any good pics from the campfire so this is all ive got.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/campfire2.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

We all went to bed pretty early that night because it was just WAY too cold and it was raining off and on all day. I was even thinking about going home saturday morning because i couldnt take it... there was even ice on the van, omfg.

Fortunately, Saturday totally cleared up. It ended up being such a BEAUTIFUL day. 


Brendon and Coconut taking a nap on the chair:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/brencoco1.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

Awwww, the dogs were holding hands! it was the cutest thing ive ever seen &hearts;

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/barneycoconut.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

...AND I CAUGHT A FROG!!!

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/frog.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

He was hopping around our tent so i made him our pet for the day (and named him Andrew dontaskmewhy lol) I wanted to take him home but i had nothing to put him in. So when we were done with him, we said goodbye and set him free in a near by pond :)

After a while, Adrianna's friends were starting to piss us off lol The camp site started to split in two; the happy drunks and annoying arguing drunks. So Brendon and i decided to go for a walk (and tried not to get lost) :/

Heres 'somebody' drinking a beer even though hes only 16. Their face was blurred out so that i dont get thrown in jail for providing a minor with alcohol haha :O

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/brenbeer3.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

So anyway, we were just walking in the complete wilderness when we found this cute little area in the middle of nowhere. A small group of hippies must have found it and hung out there because there was a small fire ring, a little bit of wood stacked up beside it, some woolly socks and a long bench made out of a log. It was right on top of the mountain and it had the raddest view ever.

After discovering this me & Bren went back to the campsite, secretly grabbed Melissa and Daylon and started slowly taking our stuff up to the place we just found.

We managed to bring pretty much all of our stuff up there without anyone noticing. Chase was the only person who asked Melissa where she was going when she was walking up the hill but she just said ""oh, im just going for a walk, i'll be back!"" hahaha it was really funny and James Bond-like.

So we got our stuff up the mountain and set up everything there.
Since we could only manage to bring up one tent, all four of us had to share a 2 man tent :/

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/campsite1.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

^sooooo cuuute!!!

Oh and since we didnt have any bathrooms, i made one for myself lol
i brought a box, cut it open, drew a sink, door & tub and voila! 
Privacy in the middle of the wilderness LOL

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/bathroom2.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

(i even did graffiti on the 'wall')

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/bathroom3.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

Im so glad we found that spot. It was 10 times better than staying at Camp Retard (as Daylon called it lol) where everyone was arguing about nothing and being complete drunken assholes. 

So after setting up our tent we tried making a fire. It took about 45mins to get it going but once we got it, it was MASSIVE!

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/makingfire.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

I realize now how much it would have totally blown to be a caveman, omfg.

After getting our fire going, all we did was drink and listen to music and laugh our asses off. We did that for 2 days straight lol :\ i actually gained 6 pounds from all the booze! i CANT believe it. And we were listening to the shittiest music too but we didnt care because nobody was around to complain about it :)
 Daylon was doing the hammerdance to ""you cant touch this"" all around the fire and Bren turned into Beyonce and started shaking his booty all around the forest to Destinys Child hahhaa! If only i knew how to upload video footage on here.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/melissa1.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
^Melissa looking at the fire (you can see me in the right lens & Day in the left)

We eventually went down to Camp Retard to get food for dinner. We just told everyone we went hiking :P
Because of my raging guilty conscious, i started feeling bad for leaving Kylie and Cassey alone with all the morons so i spent as much time with them as possible by the lake away from everyone. Kylie and i were going to go swimming; we were like, 2 feet away from jumping in the water when Alex ran over SCREAMING that there were leeches in there! :O
He said he threw a stick in the lake to play fetch with Coco, and when she came back out of the water, there was a leech attached to her tail :/

...so we just sat there for a couple of hours talking and looking for leeches lol (it was such a pretty lake. My camera can never pick up the prettiness of anything tho) :(

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/boat.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

So after dinner when everyone went to go sit by the fire again, me, Day and Melissa ditched everyone and ran off back up to the mountain to our camp. Brendon stayed behind and just played stupid when people asked him where we went lol Somebody came looking for us when they realized we went missing again, but i guess nobody went into panic mode when they noticed we took all our stuff with us too lol

We eventually got busted that night though. It was when we hot-boxed the tent lol 

Me, Day & Melissa were in the tent in the dark but i guess everytime we went to light our ghetto-style-home-made-weed-pipe, everyone could see us. They said it was pitch black, but once in a while they would look up towards the sky and up on the mountain top they would see a HUGE silhouette of someone lighting a joint HAHAHHA! Thats how they found us lol It was like the freakin BatSignal for potheads LOL omg, ive never laughed so hard when they told me that lol. Plus they said our laugher was so loud it was echoing throughout the forest :P
 
They were nice enough to leave us alone after they found us though. Actually, i think they were just too scared to be way out in the bush at night.
We kinda started getting scared when they left :/ 

When i went pee in the dark at around 1am and i heard a small little animal running across my feet ...and i flipped out. 
I ran down the mountain with my pants around my ankles screaming at the top of my lungs. It was horrible :( I got 2 mosquito bites on my bum too -_-

We tried taking our minds off of it by being stupid;
like Daylon pretending to be a turtle (with the tent as his shell)

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/turtle2.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

And then we were staring up at the stars trying to find constellations for a while but that didnt last too long because you really cant keep your mind off the fact that you could sooo be bear dinner at any time.

Plus staring up at the stars made me start talking about the universe and the topic of aliens came up which started making Melissa shake haha

THEN to make things even worse, after smoking all our weed, Melissa started looking like a Ringwraith and that made us shit ourselves LOL We all almost started crying we were so scared lol So we went inside the tent and forced ourselves to go to sleep. I heard a few animals scratching around at our stuff outside and i almost died lol. im not sure if i fell asleep or actually passed out :(

Last night was probably one of the scariest nights of my life.


This morning was great. We woke up at around 5:30 and were really happy to be alive lol 
Everyone was too hung over and tired and crusty to do anything but we had to get ready to go. So we roasted some tofu hotdogs in the fire for breakfast, blasted some 'Mellow Gold' and tried really REALLY hard to pack up our stuff.

Heres me this morning before we left making fun of Brendons pants-wearing-skills (or lack there of)

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/mebren.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

On our way out we started blaring that Canned Heat song ""Going up the Country"" while Day was hitching a ride off the back of the van just like on Woodstock; he laughed so hard when he heard it that he almost fell off LOL

Her life is pretty much exactly how i want mine to be;
get into the Film Industry, make loads of money, wont be

 <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/ride.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

<lj-cut>

Once a year, this little, hurting, small town of Summerland BC has a little fair that comes to town, i guess so that all the old people and the poor little children have something to live for every spring. Since this is my first year living out here, i thought i'd go see what it was all about (and i dragged Melissa & Kassie along with me).

Ever since i was a kid, ive been deathly afraid of heights. The only reason i would ever go to the PNE in Vancouver was for the cotton candy, games and animals and that was <u>it</u>. 
In my 22 years of existence ive never been on any type of ride that went higher than 1 foot off the ground.
Unfortunately, there was a BEER GARDEN at this fair ( aka; artificial courage).

After only 4 glasses of beer, Melissa grabbed my hand and took me to the highest ride they had :/ I mean, it was nothing much; it only went about 30 or 40 feet off the ground, but when i saw it i wanted to cry.
Of course because i was pretty buzzed, i got over that fast and thought 'ok whatthehell.'

:\

That ride whips you around 10 times really freaking fast, then it stops in mid air and whips you around 10 times again, but backwards. 
I thought i was going to die.
We told the guy operating it that i was scared of heights and to be nice to us, so he promised to do the ""mild"" version (which took only half the time).

I guess that didnt help much because Melissa said i screamed for my mom like 5 times during it, but i dont remember. I had my eyes shut the entire time and i was just screaming at the top of my lungs haha. 
Yup, that was my first scary ride ever. Im so very proud of myself ^_^

After that i went on it 2 more times lol 
When i went on it the second time with Kassie i guess the guy thought i got over my fear so he gave us the ""SCARY"" version of the ride and i almost shit my pants.

I went on a couple more different rides after, but i had to go home early because i thought i was going to puke. The sick smell of popcorn and hotdogs mixed with the smell of sweet mini donuts and cotton candy didnt help much :/
By the end of the night i was laying on the grass in fetal position, holding my head and moaning until someone drove me home.

I managed to take some pictures though:

^The ""Bush Art"" booth was very cool. They had all these weird displays with babies and animal bones and coffee makers all with plants growing out of them.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v190/miss_hell/Pic8.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
^This guy in the beer garden had a mullet wig on so i had to take a picture.
It was sooo funny. The way they fenced off the beer garden, they made it look like a zoo of alcoholics (which i guess it pretty much was lol); there was this guy sitting on the ground all alone with no shirt, no socks, a beer in his hand and a HUGE grin on his face lol i wish i took his picture.

chopping 2 inches off the ends of each one...

Beer fueled, 'tackle' soccer yesterday = fun times.
No rules. No mercy. No sobriety.
I think i got more bruises by picking fights with everybody
than playing the actual game <strike>and i totally got my 
ass kicked in</strike>. :\
We're going to try to do this at least twice a month now.

On our way back home i stopped off at A&B Sound where i spent 
all my money but gained a new best friend; <i>Justin</i>.
He saw me sporting my new beautiful Team Sleep shirt so we 
started talking for almost 20mins straight.
Hes a HUGE fan himself and what he did was ordered a shipment 
of the album for the May 10th release date, when most of the
little independent cd stores around here are getting them on 
the 17th. He took down my name and number, put one on hold 
for me and told me to come on the 9th and he'll give it 
to me then.
----------> <u>SCORE!</u> <----------

Well, im just warming up some lentil soup & chai and then i want to 
finish watching that Bela Lugosi movie <i>'White Zombie'</i> that 
i started watching but immediately fell asleep to.
I remember watching it when i was a kid but i cant remember a 
single thing about the story.

I cant sit through a lot of Bela's movies because he reminds me
too much of Dave Navarro and that just makes me laugh too much.

Oh yeah, i have to remember to pack up my stuff tonight.
Im kind of leaving it to the last minute though. 
Gotta go to Vancouver tomorrow because i have an interview 
with the film school on wednesday. 
<font size=""3"">(Im scared out of my mind.)</font> 
And im not looking forward to the 7 hour bus ride out there either.

I must be getting old or something. 
I would rather stay home than leave.

...but i <i>have to</i> go this time :(

Anyway. My new obsession at the moment is soccer.
I guess it started a couple of days ago when Melissa and I were getting really buzzed from Brazilian Beer. 
We just started talking about Brazil and she asked me if i knew any Portuguese, so i started singing,
 'Umbabarumbaaaa, homen gol!'...and it kinda all started from there. 
So this weekend we're going to Kelowna to have a drunken soccer tournament with Daylon, Mar & Sean lol
I havent played soccer since 6th grade so this should be mighty entertaining.  


Oh, Capilano called me this morning but i was sleeping.
They want to set up an interview with me!
I forgot i have to be interviewed before i find out if im in or not :o
I went through that in '00 when i applied then. 
You walk into this deathly silent room and sit down all alone; on the other side of the room, four stiff looking zombies wearing business suits are there staring at you...judging you with their scary red fiery eyes that seem to freeze your SOUL!... asking you questions about the Film Industry, hoping you'll mess up or cry or something.

PRE-ORDER THE <B>TEAM SLEEP</B> ALBUM WHEN IT COMES OUT OR AT LEAST 
PUT IT ON HOLD OR SOMETHING. FIRST OFF, THE GUY HAD NO IDEA WHAT BAND 
I WAS TALKING ABOUT AND THEN HE HAD PROBLEMS SPELLING IT WHEN CHECKING 
ON HIS COMPUTER WHICH WAS GETTING REALLY DAMN ANNOYING. WHEN HE FINALLY
BROUGHT IT UP ON THE SCREEN HE SAID APPARENTLY ITS NOT GOING TO BE 
RELEASED IN CANADA UNTIL <B>MAY 17TH</B> :0
I HELD MY MOUTH SHUT AND SCREAMED INTO MY HAND AS LOUD AS I COULD. 
HE TOLD ME HE CAN STILL ORDER IT FOR ME BUT SINCE THE STORE HAD NO 
INTENTION OF BRINGING IT IN WHATSOEVER, IT'LL BE CONSIDERED A 
'SPECIAL ORDER' AND IM GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT 2 MORE WEEKS FOR IT TO 
BE SHIPPED HERE ON TOP OF IT BEING RELEASED A WEEK LATER WHATTHEFUCK.

-SO IM THINKING MAYBE IF I ORDER IT FROM AMAZON OR SOMETHING, I'LL 
BE ABLE TO GET IT ON THE DAY ITS RELEASED? IF NOT IM GOING TO HAVE 
TO TAKE A TRIP OUT TO SEATTLE NO MATTER HOW MUCH ITS GOING TO COST ME. 
OMFG.

<strike>I LOVE CANADA</strike>

"event","So as someone has already found out (http://www.livejournal.com/users/marxilla/6060.html jerks -_-) ive been heavily into Space lately lol

Extrasolar planets to be exact. 

Ive been raiding the library every other day and spending hours reading up on Cosmology. 
Its my new <b>obsession</b>.

Right now im reading a book called ""Before the Beginning"" which talks about the big bang theory, possibilities of more universes (<-if thats even a word), what happens when a universe dies out etc...

<3333

Its just so insanely mind opening. 
And i love how after you read up on this stuff, if you really think about it, your everyday problems start to seem so damn trivial and lame.
 

I wish i was an astronaut :)"

"event","It was sooooo windy and cold today that i didnt want to go anyhere, 
so i decided to stay in and go through my 7 boxes of old books :/

I went through 2 huge pots of raspberry tea and spent the entire day reading.

Melissa found the box of books that i had stolen from school when i was in the 3rd grade 
(lol i was quite the book-klepto when i was young) and she was making fun of me for hanging on to them :P 
I was trying to explain to her that i cant get rid of them due to the emotional impact they had on me when i was little, 
but she didnt understand... 

-until she saw it:

<img src=""http://www.seg.co.jp/bookshop/personal/1FT-0.gif"">

Yeah, thats right- <u>Frog & Toad</u> :0

This was a childhood favorite of ours. She hadnt seen one of those books in like, 15 years.

After reading it, Melissa swears that Arnold Lobel wrote these books about us lol.

Theres just something about the foresty, rainy day, 70's, mushroomy, Fred Penner/Bob Ross kinda feel that we've always been so drawn to. i dunno, i cant explain it, but after reading <i>""Frog & Toad are Friends""</i> we almost started to cry lol <3333"

*drooooool*

It was just my 9th anniversary of being a vegetarian and i wanted to eat out that day.
We were just driving around Burnaby and thats when we found it:

<font size=""4"">""Paradise Vietnamese All Vegetarian Cuisine""</font>

I was almost sure i heard angels singing in the background as we pulled up. 

It specializes in Vietnamese soups except everything is made with tofu instead of meat <333 
What ive been eating is the Faux Beef Noodle Soup and jesus christ is it ever goooooooooood! I remember it used to be my favorite when my dad would make it for me when i was a gross 6 year old little carnivore. But then eventually dad lost the recipe, i stopped eating meat and i havent been able to have it until now.

They put in these cute little pieces of tofu that look like beef but tastes like rubber and they separately give you half a lime, sliced jalapeno peppers, and (if you ask for it) a truck load of Basil leaves MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. I cant stop thinking about. The taste is constantly in my head. Shit, its like crack for me haha

And the Vietnamese women working there are so awesome too. Every time i come in they try to get me to go with them every tuesday night to meditate with their '<i>MASTER</i>' <333 :D

Yes, its so good i just HAD to devote a whole entry to it, picture and all :)"

"event","<u>These Days</u>

I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking
These days, these days.
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had the chance to.

I've stopped my rambling,
I don't do too much gambling
These days, these days.
These days I seem to think about
How all the changes came about my ways
And I wonder if I'll see another highway.

I had a lover,
I don't think I'll risk another
These days, these days.
And if I seem to be afraid
To live the life that I have made in song
It's just that I've been losing so long.
La la la la la, la la.

I've stopped my dreaming,
I won't do too much scheming
These days, these days.
These days I sit on corner stones
And count the time in quarter tones to ten.
Please don't confront me with my failures,
I had not forgotten them.

"event","I've been listening to a lot of late 60's protest music lately which is what i think might have triggered that really fucked up dream i had last night.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So im at my old high school really late in the day, standing in the blistering heat, waiting for a bus to come. After a looong time, this weird looking bus finally pulls up. When i got on it was really quiet except for this voice way at the back of the bus. Everyone seemed to be facing it and listening to it. So i walked to the back and saw that it was John Lennon (like, 1969 John Lennon <3) that was talking. So, i sat down on the floor beside these 2 hippies and just listened to what he was saying. (I dont remember exactly what he was talking about but i DO remember that when i <i>half</i>-woke-up this morning [because of something brilliant he had said] i was in this really zen-like, enlightened state of mind for almost 10 whole minutes lol it was like, i knew the answers to every single question ive ever wanted to know. it was pretty damn awesome... but then when i <i>fully</i> woke up, i totally forgot everything and became all confused and dumb again) :/ 

Anyway, when he was done, everyone started talking to each other and stuff. I was sitting there looking around and i noticed Yoko Ono standing beside him wearing all white with yellow flowers in her hair, so i went up to her and asked for her autograph. I didnt have anything for her to sign so she just stood there staring at me, then grabbed my head and started to draw this REALLY strange picture on my forehead with a Sharpee lol ...when she was done, we said goodbye to each other and then i got off the bus.

The rest of the dream was <i>really</i> dumb. The bus dropped me off at an airport instead of my house, but the airport ended up being this underwater ferry station that was made of all glass. I sat beside this boy who kept offering me Twizzlers and we were observing all the underwater sea creatures until i woke up."

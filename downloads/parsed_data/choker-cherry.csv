"event","So this week Cathy and I have volunteered to do makeup on battered womens group on East Hastings. I think it will be a great experience to do this, especially since most of these woman have never been touched in a positive way before. Now, I didnt know about East Hastings til yesterday when I looked it up online. I guess it has the highest HIV rate in Canada, there's a needle exchange there, lots of homeless people, drug adicts and prostitures. The HIV thing worries me a bit, for when Im getting there with Cathy, and even when Im doing their makeup (What if they have open sores on their faces.. etc) but Im hoping Ill just get some good karma for this and have a great experience :)

Ive finished two classes in the last two weeks. Intro to art and tech, which is where we learned how to take proper portfolio pictures with our digital cameras, to make them look like a professional photograph, rather than a snapshot. Ill post a pic of my final picture soon.

Then we had our cosmetic retailing course. I thought it was a lot of fun, and it makes me want to go back into cosmetic retail. I never realized how much I liked it, and the reasons why. I think I like it so much because Im actually selling the things that I enjoy rather than vitamins, or consigned sports equipment (don't get me wrong, because I do like working at Sports Junkies)

I joined the gym this week, and also ended some Logan drama :(


Ill write more about that soon.. gotta go to work! Im always busy bsuy, Im doing full time school, and fulltime work!"

"event","God it really annoys me that I've been wanting to make a photo blog and my camera decides to break.

So I absolutely love Vancouver. It's been a little over a month since I moved here.

 I got a job about 2 weeks after I moved here, I work at a Sports Consignment store, it's so chill and cool. And literally everyone who works there, including the owner is a store so they're all like chill as hell too haha.


My school is amazing. Even though we're starting off with the basics of makeup fundamentals, I'm really enjoying myself, while learning at the same time. I've also been pushing myself in school to excel and be the best I can possibly be. So say I get a 90% on an assignment, I pretty much kick my butt and make sure I do way better next time. This is the first time in my life too that I've actually been doing all of my homework and have been studying for class too. I think it's because I'm finally doing something that I like.

I have a shitty camera for now, and I can't find my other memory card that has all of my pictures I took when I *just* moved here.. but when I  find the card, and get my new camera, I'll post more. Especially since I got my new laptop this week (Yay exciting!)

I'm moving to Vancouver in March! I've been accepted to Blanche MacDonald. I've been talking back and forth with Irish Harper from Blanche, and she was telling me how they are extremely interested in having me, and how they have a coordinator help you with finding a place to stay (whether I wanted to have roomates, or live alone). So soon I will be talking to the coordinator to help me find a place, preferrably cheap, with roomates (since I dont know anyone in Van so I'm going to be lonely! :( )

"event","How I envy you. Seriously, how do you do it? I bought myself some white out contact lenses for this Halloween, as I will be a grotesquely glorious zombie, and thought, what better to make it look more 'real' than contacts! 

So I ordered them online, got a 25% discount, free pair of sunglasses, and they arrived at my home a day later. Excellent.

Now, I've never worn contacts before, but, I have no problem touching my eye, so how hard can it be?

I've been trying for the past hour and a half to get these things in my eyes (yes I've cleaned them and sterilized them with solution and all that good stuff first) HOLY CRAP. I can't stop them from going inside out as I press them onto my eyeball!

I've tried to be sneaky and slide it on my eye, no luck. I tried to be like fast and just get it in there, no luck. I've even tried holding the contacts with TWO fingers to try and stop it from going inside out. Nope.

 I just can't figure it out. I've watched countless YouTube videos, and read all the how tos on holding my eyelids open 'a la clockwork orange' while holding my eyelashes so they don't bat the contact off my finger. It looks so easy to do it!

I'm giving up for today, my eye is tired from being opened that wide. :( Gonna have beer and wings with Susana and Dave tonight."

"event","So, last week, I registered to get an information package to go to Blanche McDonald for next year, and I just got the today. The courses look amazing, the professors have amazing credentials. This school is exactly what I need. But while I was looking at the application, and saw the cost of the school I was kind of shocked. 

It's $14,000 for the full time, 11 month professional makeup artistry course I want to take. But with kit fees, as well as supplies, I'm looking at around $17,500. Now, I've saved about $14,000 with all my working that I've done since I finished high school, and it scares me that I don't have enough. It's going to be hard for me to get a loan, considering my dad makes too much money for me to be eligible for most.

Also, I have to look for a place to live in Vancouver, which I think is going to be pretty hard, especially since the Vancouver Olympics are coming closer and closer. I wish I knew more people there. 

Augh.

We had a bonfire, roasted hotdogs in it (we lost 8 of our 12 hot dogs to the fire) drank (I uh, poured about 7 down the drain, for each time we went to the washroom, I know it isn't right, but when they offer beer and I say no, I'm still handed one, so it'll go down a diff drain)<br/><br/>Susana and I made blood sausage with her mom. Her mom brought like a (literal) ice cream pail of blood and a bag full of intestines. So cool! Her mom was amazed I wasn't grossed out. Were eating them tomorrow :)<br/><br/>I got my first credit card in the mail yesterday! Woo hoo! I applied for that thing months ago, and figured I'd just get declined. Nope!

"event","Wewt. This past week has been pretty good :)

Went to Calgary not last weekend but the weekend before, got to spend some time with Jen and Trev. Watched a football game, ate out lots (woohoo!) and got to go to Halloween hobby shops in Calgary (we have none in Edmonton) and I bought a lot of special effects makeup, like ben nye liquid latex, graftobian flesh latex, ben nye fake blood, and a awesome kryolan face makeup pallet. I CANT WAIT FOR HALLOWEEN!!!

Got my hair done on... I think it was Tuesday. Dyed it black, and neon blue, kinda cut my hair a bit around the front so it has some shape, since I've had like no shape to my hair recently, because all I've been doing is grow it out.

On Friday I saw Repo! The Genetic Opera with Britt and her friend. It was actually better than I thought it would be, I was waiting for it for a while! I had no idea it was an 'exclusive premier to western Canada"" just being shown in Edmonton, not Calgary , and not in BC like in Vic or Van.

Sunday I had my drivers training written exam, I passed that so I was really happy :D Now I just have my 5 driving classes and then I'll be taking my actual drivers test and I'll finally have my drivers license. Yay!

Today I went to Value Village, was looking for clothing to make that part of my Halloween costume. I found exactly what I was looking for, but it didn't fit, which sucks. Basically, I'm looking for dresses, to just fuck up and zombify. I think I'm going to go to Value Village again tomorrow, but I'm going to buy a wedding dress (they had lots) and fuck that up.

Oh! I found a Juicy Couture purse there, I was pretty suprised.

Then I Wii fitted for the rest of the day, and then worked out with my weights (I'm trying to lose weight, and get in shape, without fucking up my back :P )

And then I watched Doomsday with Dad! Apparently that movie has gotten a lot of flack for being bad. But I actually really liked it. It had great makeup, props, stunts and effects. I really enjoy it. But then again, I enjoy fucked up movies.

Wee!"

"event","Alright SO. My week has been pretty busy, so I thought I'd do a little recap before I start doing my normal posts.

So this week, I quit my job at superstore. Last year I was promoted to Supervisor, which was sweet, I've done a super fantastic job, but the pharmacists feel as though I haven't had enough coverage on the salesfloor, as they're *constantly* helping and showing customers where products are. I'm sorry, I can't control where the customers go. So they wrote a formal email to Galen Weston. Yes, the guy you see on all the commercials, telling everyone how great our Superstore products are. And from him down, I got shit, for no reason at all.

We also had a newish manager for the last couple months. She used to be our District Manager, but she stepped down. Within her first week at our store, as a Store Manager, she decided to tell me she rather have no Supervisor than have me, and all this great stuff. And she continued talking to me like that for about 2 months, til she quit. And then the day before she left the company, she told me how she wished she'd have fired me when she had the chance to, and how she will be watching me. And reporting to the District manager, on any screwups I make. Even though she lives an hour and a half away. Psycho.

So I've decided to quit. My sanity is worth much more to me, than my paycheck. With all the stress at work, I've been losing a lot of hair. And it's been scaring me.

I'm hoping to go to school in either January, or next September (of 2009). However, I can't quite decide on what I would like to do. There's Makeup Artistry classes I would LOVE love love to take. And then there's Dental Assistant, and Denturist courses I could take too. And as much as I enjoy makeup, I'm starting to think maybe I should grow up, get a career where I can make the big bucks, and then do makeup on the side? I don't know what to do. Because I *really* *really* want to do makeup on runway models. And I don't mean like mall runway shows, I mean like high fashion AWESOME makeup.

I read the whole Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer. They're SO good. I totally recommend them. I haven't read a book in YEARS. Or at least since I graduated. And I really enjoyed them all. The first one more so than the others, however.

I had to go to the hospital last Saturday. I was doing price changes, and my back went out. Couldn't walk, stand up, anything. The doctor  says I slipped a disc. I told them I have a lump on my back, but they seem to think that it's a ball of fat, and that usually people get a marble size lump like that. And I'm like no... it's golf ball size, and most people DON'T have that.

I had turkey dinner and Karens in Laws yesterday. Yum yum. :)

Man. I've totally missed LiveJournal. I started to write an entry on my Iphone, but my sister grabbed my phone, and my post disappeared.

But yeah, from now til January, I need to make a plan.

My plan so far is to...
a) get my back back to 100%
b) get my friggen drivers license, because I'm a lazy ass.
c) go on a trip, or a holiday
d) look for another high paying full time job
e) go to school and suffer for years til I get a good career and degree

That's all I've got so far.

"event","So it may be Christmas soon, but I am so excited for my Sephora purshaces to arrive! I ordered Juicy Couture perfume, some glitter liner, and this gold makeup sample set. And today I totally splurged on Whyte ave, and bought this awesome sweater with lacing in the back (Its sexy), and then I decided to change my skincare line of random drugstore crap, and have invested in the Lush skincare line. I Looooooooove lush. Everything smells like candy. I want to eat it. But I cant, so I just put it on my face.

I'm not done my christmas shopping yet, I still have to buy my dads present. I have no idea what he wants, he pretty much the hardest person to shop for.

I've decided to nix the idea of me wanting to become a chef. Because my interests truly lie in makeup and fashion. And I really do want to be a makeup artist. So there's this course in Calgary I might be taking in Calgary or 6 weeks, and I think that it'll be really fun. My sister Jen says I can live with her and Trevor, which would be totally awesome. Kate and Tom don't want me to go there, because they think I'll turn out psychotic like my sister Jen if I stay with her for more than a week."

After Britts mom dropped us off on Whyte, we walked up to Urban Lounge, had a couple drinks (I had mah vodka slimes there since they make awesome ones) No live music though, probably because it was pretty early when we started bar hopping (Started at about 8:30ish)

Then we went to the Black Dog, I had an electric popsicle, they were outta melon liqeur, so they put something else in, but it tasted like candy, so it was all good. We were gonna order apple martinis, but they were out of the apple sour stuff. So then we went to The Attic. Lol i wear it was literally in an attic of some place, it was freakn high up, and stairs ftl when you're drinking. We both got our apple martinis there, but apparently it was a high ball place, and theyve never made it there, so they tasted mosty like vodka which made meh gag and I couldnt drink it. And it was liek a $5 drink and it was like a SIP. I didnt drink it though cuz it was bleck, but i made britt down hers like a shot. :) Kek

After that we got hungry, and got some funky pickle pizza, which was like awesome! 

after that we were gonna go to bar wild, but there was like a line up, so we went to The One instead, which is one of my favourite places. They had good dance music, and we were there for a while. When we came in, it was practically empty because the hockey game was on. And after that peopl started dancing more, at first it was just this one guy dancing backwards and lik cowboy style and then everyone danced

after that we went to monkey island and that was it :O"

I really wonder if she does work sometimes. Like, I came on at 10, didnt see her in her office, and she wasnt in the back either, first time I saw her was at 11, and that was when she came to inform me that she was going for lunch. Then she seemed to be gone for about 3 hours, and then she worked on some socks for like 5min, and then she disappeared til 4, which was the time she was leaving to go home. It seems to be like that all the time, so its really been making me wonder.
Anyhow I sold about like 20 perfumes today, Glow by Jlo is on sale for $20 each right now, which is crazy cheap, so everyones been getting that for people for christmas.
I saw Josees mom today, she was shopping for Sheila. I havent seen her in like 5 years. She says I look like my sisters. That made me feel good because I think my sisters are really pretty, and I definitely wouldnt mind looking like them eventually :p
Anyhow, back to deciding what Im gonna wear for bar hopping on Whyte with Britt for her 18th :)

I definitely haven't written here for a long time! I graduated High School, and have been working at Superstore in the cosmetics section for about 5 months (lawl). 
I stopped playing WoW like a week ago, and sold my 60 Druid for $3200 canadian. And with that, I bought a laptop yesterday (an aspire 5100 acer (it's so good! Better than the computer at home!))
I still <3 Logan very much, hopefully we'll move in together in January.

Right now I am very sick and need rest! I'll atually post now, since I have access to my computer all the time, and I won't forget about LJ<3


Hi2u Kerri, Britt and whoever else still uses LJ"

"event","So apparently everything that I wanted to do for him for his birthday backfired completely -_- So I was pretty upset like all day because I don't think that his birthday is something that he shouldnt look forward to or  enjoyed, so I'm gonna make like all of his other birthdays like super fantastic. He told me that as long as I loved him, that would be the greatest gift of all. I find it so sweet that he'd say something like that, however I'm gonna make a fuss about his birthday next year, phone Ryan and his mom and just do something big and nice.

So yeah, I haven't posted in a while (Big suprise huh?)  I've just been playing WoW so much that I haven't really had a chance to post anything.

My summer was pretty good I guess. Played lots of WoW, and went to Kairees lake for the last week of summer break, I had a blast. Oh. Got a $1600 phone bill too, but heh, not gonna talk about that ;o

Schools been going pretty well so far, im doing great in math for once and english too. Biology is like my weakest point, I have to take it way more serious in order for me to pass. I've been super organized this year (First year ever of being organized, its great) But ive still been slacking off in actually doing my homework and stuff, which will bring my marks down if I dont get my ass into gear.

My mom wants to take me to all sorts of open houses for college like NAIT and Macewan, but I don't want to go to those schools at all :/ Like if I do go to college in Alberta (Im not gonna) id go to marvel. But my dad like laughed and told me there's no way I could get into that school, and my mom keeps trying to push me into going into Fashion design, which I Don't want to do, I want to go into cosmetics. She doesnt understand that being an esthetician DOESNT mean working in the bay. That's exactly what she thinks. And sure I am good at making clothes (I admit it) however, it's not my passion. Sure I have fun once in a while but I get sick of working on a project after a while. and I love working with makeup, no matter what type or style it is.

I also have to break it to my parents that I'm not going to College next year, I'm going to take a year off. I'm going to tell that to them in january though, when I turn 18. Because I know they're gonna raise hell when they hear that Im going to move to Florida with Logan.

I wish I could fix my relationship with my parents. But I know I can't. We are both so different from one another, and they just act so weird. I need to get out of my house as soon as possible once Im done school, because we do nothing but fight. I'm so jealous of people who can actually like relate to their parents, have conversations with each other without having to start a confrontation, telling them what Id like to aspire in life and just  stuff like that.

My sister finally had her baby ^^ It's a girl, and her name is Harper. I asked Sebastian what he'd like to get his little sister for her birthday and he was like ""A snake!"" Lol it was so cute <33 Lol he calls himself the  big sister and her the little brother ^^

Anyhow, Ill try and write more often

Adios, 
Holly"

"event","Well let's see what's new from what I last posted...

Well, I finished school, and have started Bio 20 (again) in summerschool at Paul Kane. Apparently my school is welfare cos in this class there's things I never learned in actual school >_> And we get to disect pig fetuses. My school never got to do that.

So I was at west ed with sebastian the other day. And we went to winners to look at the toys, and I noticed this kind of creepy man standing by the washrooms (which was right beside the toy section) looking at all the kids. So I kept my eye on him, while I was looking at the toys with Sebastian. Moments later he disappeared to the bathroom. I was like okay.. that's fine. So I continue on looking at the toys with my favourite nephew. 5 minutes later, the man comes out of the bathroom, and hangs out near the toys some more, looking at the kids, walking around trying to look inconscpicuous as he's like wiggling his fingers around. After a couple minutes he goes back into the bathroom... for like 20minutes. Then he came back out and hung out near the toys again. So I thought to myself Holy fuck this is sick. So I went to one of the employees at Winners, and got him kicked out. I told them exactly what he was doing.

Fuck that was sick as all hell.

So I recently learned that I have unlimited long distance minutes (international) so I've been calling logan lots lately. Thing is that I wasted HUNDREDS of dollars on phone cards. That kind of made me sick to the stomach. Especially since I have no job, and no real way of making money (I don't even have an allowance) And ironically, by a garbage can at Northgate mall I found this $20 long distance calling card, and there was like $18.37 left on it. I was like holy fuck I have weird luck!  Finding that while I used phone cards wouldve been much nicer.



I've been playing WoW tons lately. It seems to have like taken over my life. I find it pretty sick, but I can't stop playing it x_X I find it fun, and its just so time consuming. I'm only level 44, but once I hit 45 I'm gonna be power leveling to 60.

So I went to that Canada day thing with Kairee, I had fun wif her since I never ever ever see her. We watched some crazy man like bend over and like try to catch the rain with his tongue (It was quite creepy) And we saw the barenaked ladies. Before they went on, Kairee and I were determined to get into the floor seats. So at first we borrowed someones tickets, because they already had the wristbands to get through, so we tried and we were told to get the wristbands at the front of the place, so we went, but then noticed on the back of the tickets, there was a permanent marker X showing that they had already been used. So we then got a bunch of canadian flags (The wristbands were red btw) ripped them up, and put them together with gum, and put them on our wrists. We got through. It was so awesome :3
Barenaked ladies were good, they sound just like they do on the radio. Although I'm not a fan of the music, I know Kairee is, and I just had a really fun time :)

Ohohohoh I'm finally getting a Social insurance card/number. so I can finally get a job! I'm gonna start working on my resume, and try to apply at shoppers drug mart for the cosmetic section, or at mac! Eeeee. Exciting :3333

Anyhoo, Later :)

"event","Ebay is so queer. I used my sisters ebay account to put my runescape account up for auction like many people do, and three days into the auction I get this:

Dear Katherine Bell (thegreatkatherine@shaw.ca),

**PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT EMAIL REGARDING YOUR LISTING(S)**

We would like to let you know that we removed your listing:


8200699324 Runescape Level 71 Character



because an intellectual property rights owner notified us, under penalty of perjury, that your listing offers a copyrighted item in violation of a license.

We have credited any associated fees to your account. We have also notified the bidders that the listing was removed, and that they are not obligated to complete the transaction.

If you relist this or any other similar items on eBay, your account likely will be suspended.



I find this ridiculous! I followed all the guidelines, and did exactly what the other people have done, and I get the warning, and they don't? It doesn't make sense. I just wanna make some money for  game that I put a lot of time into.
And yeah I mightve been 'caught' but my auction was with all the other runescape account auctions, so it doesn't make sense that they delete my auction and no one elses."

"event","Okay so I didn't do *as* well as I thought I did on my math final. But nevertheless, I did pretty good for me, considering how crappy I usually do in math. I got 65% :3 I was so excited when I found that out.
I'm gonna be at my sisters this whole week watching Sebastian.

Tom wants me to play warhammer with his friends (It's like these painted action figurines and you like try and conquer the world >_>) I excited said yes because the name started with war, and in my head, I made it end in craft. I was like k warcraft! And then tom was like No.. warhammer! I was like k!

So now I get to play with Tom and his friends tonight >_> This'll be odd. A bunch of mid 20 year old guys saying ""YOU KILLED MY ELF YOU BASTARD, WELL MY WARLOCK IS GOING OT PWN YOU""

Rofl this'll be interesting"

I think I've gotten Tom addicted to WoW, because everytime he comes over, he like nudges me to turn on WoW and he makes me sit down with him, and like show him how to play. And I'm going to their house for this whole week (right after my final tomorrow) and he wants me to bring it so that we can play >> I told him I was gonna delete his character before, and he was like ""WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!"" and he bit me <_< I have THE weirdest brother in laws ever.

You can see my other brother in law, Trevor, here: www.silverstampeder.com o_o

Whee.

Logan: I love your hair by the way
Logan: I love everything about your fashion sense, etc
Me: The last pic made me realize how white I am o-o
Logan: I wish I had any fashion sense. =(
Logan: You're gonna have to fix me
Logan: =O

That'll be fun :x

But I just have to keep telling myself ""Tomorrow is your last final, and then no more studying"" But then I have that reocurring thought that I start summer school on the fourth. Woo fuckity doo.

My parents got these tickets to go to this all day long Canada Daything. There's like concerts and crap (The Barenaked Ladies and other stuff) Now, one might be like grateful and ecstatic over this, however I don't like those bands, and would much rather stay and home and play WoW like the hermit that I am. So there's one extra ticket (Kairee or Britt, just leave me a comment if you're interested in coming) And they told me to invite a friend, or they'd get Kate and Tom to go instead, and I would watch Sebastian for the day. Now I much rather do that. My parents seem to think I see babysitting Sebastian as a punishment, but I don't at all. I love the kid, and honestly don't mind watching him at all. But then again, they're the ones who don't really like him, and told my sister to have an abortion when she was pregnant with him. 

I'm still trying to figure out ways to go to Florida. I've pretty much ran out of ideas. sigh

I'll take some pictures of my jacket that I made, and post them in my journal."

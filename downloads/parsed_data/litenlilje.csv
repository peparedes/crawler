"event","I bought a yellow scarf today:D For 25 kroners, wonderful. Its pretty, and snuggly, and I think I might have a crush on it. o.O 
Anywho, today I will go get the camera from the local newspaper, and start shooting my video-diary. Why did I sign up for this? A stupid thing to do seeing as I really have no desire of showing my morning-face to everyone in Bergen. And I wonder how my old aunt Kjellaug is going to react if she sees the show... I haven told her I'm gay yet. *Cough*
Think that I might have screwed up big time here. 
Ah, sod it, it'll only last for like five minutes or so, how much morning-sleepy-face and gayness can they squeeze in?"

"event","Life has this creepy effect on me sometimes. I seem to find myself disliking a lot of things it offers me, yet I cannot refuse to accept them. I've tried to just say no, I really have. Once I even tried to use a rather rude tone when I declined one of the most horrific offers, but it seems I am not allowed voice my opinion without getting several stabs in the back. Am I being selfish or is this just not fair? I mean, I cannot recall being mean to life, so why is it allowed to be so horrible to me without even getting punished for it? When I was younger I got sent to my room if I wasn't behaving properly, and so were my sisters, but life never got sent anywhere. I don't think that's a fair deal, do you? But then again, does life ever get a treat? I'm not sure about that, I'll have to ask next time it offers me something. If it doesn't get any treats then I think we're about even, but I still would prefer if it got some snack-packs instead of getting away with everything. I don't get -that- many treats. Maybe if I share mine? I wouldn't mind, seriously! It could have some!"

"event","So, yesterday I decided to write a page full of only happy thoughts. (Well, it's not yesterday yet seeing as I'm writing this today). (No, that didn't make sense... I wrote this yesterday (today) but I'm writing it right now, only ""right now"" is actually yesterday). (Ah, fuck it, you know what I mean, yeah?).
(Well, you probably don't but just forget about it, it's not the point).
Uhm, yeah... What was I saying?
Oh yeah, happy page full of thoughts! 
No, happy thoughts on a full page. Crap! Just read the top, ok?
Anywhooo... Yesterday (or today that is) (oh god, don't get in to this again!) was a brilliant day. Warm, sunny and rather joyful as I finally got around to taking my pills. *cough* That sounded bad. It's not though, medicine is good for those who need it. 
Erm, right, not really helping, am I? (Just try to not pay to much attention to the pill thing, that's not the point either, this is about yesterday (today) being a splendid day.)
Well, actually I was just going to write down some happy thoughts, but it seems I have forgotten about that. I can't find a way to jump back to writing happy thoughts instead of what I'm writing now, so I guess I'll just have to stick to this.
Right... So... What I'm writing now doesn't really have a topic does it? Well of course it's the ""splendid day"" thing, but that's just a wee bit too boring to rant on about. 
Hmm, tis quite hard to write about something that has no topic, cause then there ain't nothing to write about.
You know what? This is just stupid, I'm writing about nothing instead of cleaning my room like I should be doing. My god, I just wasted a whole ten minutes and a perfectly fine piece of paper on nothing. And on top of that it made me confused and stressed. Hmph... If this ruins my splendid day (yesterday) I'm going to eat a lollipop to cheer me up. (Forget that, I've already started on the lolly.)
Well, anywhoo, Ima stop now."

(Wait a sec, I'm sick o callin her ""wee lass"" all the time. Her name was Fairy Mary Twisted Twat, but I fink I'll just go fer Fairy Twat.)
So... Where was I? Oh yes... She was raised by... No, fook, I've said dat. Gimme a sec...
Shite, how bloody stoopid.
Ya, anywhooo...
In dis village, yeah? Mad hounds weren't allowed. By dat I mean; if yeh was a hound (n a mad one even) yeh was not worthy o conversations n such wif the otha inhabitants o the village. So obviously dis was a problem fer Fairy Twat. She was no hound, but was considered to be one by the village folks. Yes, it was all quite irritatin, especially when she grew older n proved herself much smarter dan dem idiot children o deirs. Dem fookers! I've neva in mi lifetime met ne1 as stoopid as... No, wait, got carried away there, forget wot I said. Where was I? Yes... Idiot kids.
Aye, now, Fairy Twat didn't care much fer the hounds, I mean, she didn't really have a problem wif em, she just didn't like em very much. Well, the hounds didn't seem to like Fairy Twat very much either, so it was, in a weird way, a win-win situation. 

Did I mention dat dis story has no endin n is in all quite useless? Well, it is, n it has no meanin either, cause it ain't personal. Fairy Twat ain't meh, n the hounds ain't mi family, s all just rubbish on paper. Dis was written in ten minutes at mi favorite cafe. I was bored n was drawin a fairy on a library book, hence - Fairy Mary Twisted Twat. I looked out the window n saw a fookin big evil lookin dog; mad hounds.

To speak of such makes me nothing but a fool. 
Thou should not speak of the unspeakable.
Yet, if the unspeakable does not remain unspoken, who would have the nerve to cast such a filthy name upon me when all I did was to speak of something that once was unspoken?
Like speaking the unspeakable thou should not rename someone based on grounds of speaking ability.
This is why I want to move to backwardsworld, where the unspoken already has been spoken of.
I can not speak the unspeakable in this world, nor can I in backwardsworld. 
Therefor no one can cast me a filthy name based on grounds other than wasting a fine piece of paper."

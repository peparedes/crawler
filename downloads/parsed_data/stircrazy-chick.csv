Seen as a<br>sophisticated and mature person, you are liked<br>by many an adult.  But otherwise, you're a<br>rebellious and controversial person.  On the<br>other hand, you're also very conservative and<br>and frugle.  Is it possible that you enjoy<br>reading a heavy book?  But seen as mysterious<br>and hidden, it may be hard to find someone to<br>talk to.  You're not a particularly outgoing<br>person, but you do enjoy a good, long talk with<br>a person.  Debating is one of your favorite<br>forms of communication.  You just enjoy<br>stirring strong emotions inside people, and<br>watching the reaction.  But as you watch, are<br>you sipping straight (unsweetened) coffee?

Very intense weekend, headed to Lancaster, PA to the biggest fish store I have ever seen and been in! Huge sale so Dan & Rich were like kids in a candy store. It was cool, stopped to eat at this lil' dive and it turned out to be quite the place to eat...they has ""broasted"" chicken??? Was really good though, and the waitress kept using the word ""yous"" ya know like, what do yous want to drink?? Dan was not being very polite. Anyways that was Saturday.

Sunday we went to visit my mom and Caitlin before we headed over to Michelle's for Anthony's confirmation (it is a Catholic thing!) reception. Nice to see the Steffes'. Some of the Torreys asked about you GUCCI. Told them you were good and doing fine! So that was nice to see everyone.

But that is all  I can say for now, gotta go do some work!!!!!! I have been slackin' cuz it has been so nice. 84 degrees today & 88 tomorrow!!! need to work on my tan."

"event","I have been tremendously busy around the house. Trying to keep my job. It has been late nights watchin' movies and wakin' up late. So my whole day just zips by. Watched Finding Neverland w/ Chloe the other night cuz Dan wouldnt cuz he said it would be stupid. I thought it was GREAT. I want to read the book now cuz it really touched me. I dont mean the Little Golden Book version either.

So here is the past week or so in a nutshell...

Had Easter dinner here with my mom (Pris) & sisters (Boo, E.T. & Cat), yes we were all here! Uncle J, Granny & Yimmy (aka Jimmy, E.T.'s friend????). Grandma Harris came too...I beat Fi to the punch on that invite!!!!!!!! Not to brag or anything. We had a wonderful dinner prepared mostly by my wonderful hubby. Didn't do the whole dying of the eggs, way too messy for the youngins I have. We all got decked out in our Easter duds, went to church all that good stuff. We also started a tradition this year, we are going to watch The Passion of the Christ every Easter to keep it all into perspective. I cant watch certain parts though, it is way too much for me to handle. It is unfathomable to me how he endured what he did. No words can explain what he did for us...

Got back into the swing of things on Monday, back to the phones collecting the do-re-mi from customers who dont want to pay their bills. It is rather a shame some of these people, but anywho. Kids are great we all have our health and we are truly blessed with a home and food in our bellies. We are grateful for all the Lord has given us and will give us!

American Idol this week was a true disappointment, Jessica should not have went home...oh well, Nadia got another freebie. Next week though she is outta there! Sorry Ash, but she has gotta go babe.

Survivor tonight, getting kinda boring cuz the same team keeps winning and nothing exciting going on, it is at the point where it is pretty predictable.

Been at it with Chloe all day. That girl has a huge problem with listening or she just likes to get her butt whipped! Who the heck knows. All day long she is non-stop sometimes to the point where I am ready to pulll every hair outta my head. She is in need of getting out of this house. We are going to go to the library this weekend and get some books and have a day out of the house and do stuff. Once the weather starts to get nicer they can go outside and play more. That will help a lot too. They went out yesterday for awhile after Daddy got home and they ate their dinner outside so that was good for them!

Ty is laid out on the desk, he was soooo tired poor thing!! Talk about pooped! 

Well I hope this gets u up to date, but I gotta go help take out the garbage...FUN I KNOW!!!

Hugs & Kisses

I took your Shorty quiz and of course I got GIANT, but I dont know how to cut and paste the DAMN THING!!!!

Oh by the way...my words of wisdom:

>Somebody said that a child is carried in its mother's womb for nine months.
>Somebody does not know that a child is carried in its mother's heart forever.
>Somebody said it takes about six weeks to get back to normal after you've had a baby.
>Somebody doesn't know that once you're a mother, normal is history. (AMEN!)
>Somebody said you learn how to be a mother by instinct.
>Somebody never took a three-year-old shopping. (NO KIDDING!!!)
>Somebody said being a mother is boring.
>Somebody never rode in a car driven by a teenager with a driver's permit. (WHOA ASH!)
>Somebody said if you're a ""good"" mother, your child will ""turn out good"".
>Somebody thinks a child comes with  directions and a guarantee.
>Somebody said ""good"" mothers never  raise their voices.
>Somebody never came out the back door just in time to see her child hit a golf ball through the neighbor's kitchen window.
>Somebody said you don't need an education to be a mother.
>Somebody never helped a fourth grader with his math.
>Somebody said you can't love the fifth child as much as you love the first.
>Somebody doesn't have five children.
>Somebody said a mother can find all the answers to her child rearing questions in the books.
>Somebody never had a child stuff beans up his nose. (IT WAS ROCKS FOR ME!)
>Somebody said the hardest part of being a mother is labor  and delivery.
>Somebody never watched her ""baby"" get on the bus for the first day of kindergarten.
>Somebody said a mother can do her job with her eyes closed and one hand tied behind her back.
>Somebody never organized seven giggling Brownies to sell cookies.
>Somebody said a mother can stop worrying after her child gets  married.
>Somebody doesn't know that marriage adds a new son or daughter-in-law to a mother's heart strings.
>Somebody said a mother's job is done when her last child leaves home.
>Somebody never had grandchildren.
>Somebody said your mother knows you love her, so you don't need to tell her.
>Somebody isn't a mother.
>Pass this along to all the ""Mothers"" and ""Grandmothers"" in your life!"

I HEAR: Steve Burns...Blue's Clues, OH & Hunter saying ""bouncy bouncy bouncy bouncy!""
I SEARCH: google for everything...DITTO
I WONDER: what could of been
I REGRET: nothing. and only LEARN from my mistakes...Couldn't have said it better myself
I LOVE: GOD, my hubby, my kids, my family...OH man, lots of stuff
I CARE: too much about stupid things
I ALWAYS: try to make everyone happy
I AM NOT: the best, but I am not the worst
I CRY: because it feels so good too
I FIGHT: for my right to party...those wise guys The Beastie Boys always said!
I WRITE: e-mails and in my LJ
I WIN: everyday because I was given the opportunity to be a mother
I LOSE: my temper too easily, gotten be more humble 
I LISTEN: sometimes, only if I like what the person is saying  :\
I CAN USUALLY BE FOUND: watching TV, cleaning, or getting on the kids
I NEED: to control my emotions and make sure I keep in touch with family more
I AM HAPPY ABOUT: waking up everyday and being able to be with my kids & that Ash is doing so well!
I SHOULD: go and get Chloe dressed up, she wants to look like Gwen Stefani today!!!

Before I go though...

I just want to take a minute to have a moment of silence for Shorty, that is my Mom's dog. She passed away 2 nights ago. I know she was like a baby to my Mom so I just want to give her a moment. She was small and we stepped on her a lot, but we all loved her and she lived a long full life!!! WE ARE GONNA MISS YOU SHORTY!!!!"

"event","I had the Bishop's wife come to visit me this morning, so I had to yank myself outta bed to make sure I was presentable. She is my visiting teacher from Relief Society. Got to talking about kids and all sorts of stuff. I had incredible things to say about smashley86, cuz your such a great kid. I have great thing to say about all my kids...they all do things that make me so proud. Like I am so proud of Chloe because she went and made her Bro (Hunter) a hot dog w/ ketchup for lunch. I am proud of Hunter because he didnt throw a fit when Chloe took out the Blue's Clues video and replaced it for Cinderella. I am really proud that Ty went to sleep and hopefully will sleep for an hour! Spoke too soon..I hear Ty screaming now!! Well that was short lived, oh well. Now he is playing Little Red Riding Hood w/ Chloe and she just informed me she isn't happy about it! HAHAHAHA

Gotta go--helping Hunter find Wags the Dog!"

"event","I spent all day cleaning the toy room. I had too, it was really dusty up here and bad for the kids. The kids were NOT a help at all. I cleaned every crack and crevice in this room! Vacuumed, dusted, spit shined all the toys. It was a job, but I got it done and I was happy with the results.

Now if they could learn CLEAN-UP I would be so so happy. I am gonna just chill for the rest of the night and let Dan deal with the kids!!!!

Sorry so short..."

So I woke up today to the phone ringing, just ignored it, but wouldn't you know that as soon as the damn thing stopped ringing I had to pee! So guess what I had to get up anyway.  Hunter has been a pill today, a REAL pain in the side. He was good for a little while. Him and Ty were playing together really well until he knocked Ty over and then it was over. Chloe is watching ""her shows"" and playing tea party downstairs. I am happy about that she has a problem with being QUIET (this word is not in her vocab) when I am on the phone trying to call customers! Anywho just thought I would put a few words down while they were in my head."

"event","I tried to cut and paste the Laguna Beach Quiz, but dont know how...HELP!!!

I am super tired. We just got finished drawing the Blue's Clues characters. SUPER FUN!!! We are gonna turn the drawings into a story. We will leave that up to Chloe AKA ""Ella"". Chick actually wants me to change her name to Ella...trippin' aint she!!! LOVE HER TO DEATH THOUGH.

Funny story...today at church she wasn't being to reverent during the sacrament passing so I had a lil' heart to heart about how important it was to be reverent during the passing of scarament. Anywho it really stuck w/ her cuz later the Primary Pres came up to me and your fasha and told us that Chloe had came up to her to tell her how REVERENT she was being and that if all the children were reverent that she would give them a special surprise. Using the bribe just like her momma!!! I AM SO SO PROUD. So just when you think they aren't listening, they just may be. I got a kick outta that.

Hunter didn't last long in nursery so I ended up camping out there. Hunter was having a rough day. He was a bit of a bully today. Quite embarassing at times, he really was showing his attitude(which he gets from his daddy!). Gotta love him though. He seems to get along well with this lil' girl named Emma. They are very much alike. They play well at times then they are on the ground play fighting. It is really cute. All in all church went by quickly so I cant complain. All the kids loved playing with Ty. They all wanted to hug and kiss him and Hunter didn't like that at all. 

Hope your day was as eventful and I am off to dreamland...ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"

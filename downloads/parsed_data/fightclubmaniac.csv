"event","I did everything I was supposed to.  I layed the foundation.  A pretty thick one made of concrete. The walls were built around it, hastily possibly, but they were there.  Perhaps I put the roof on too quickly and the walls weren't ready.  Collapsing in on itself, smothering anything beneath it.  The thick foundation nothing more than a pile of dust left to blow away with nothing to hold up.  The shards of the walls sticking awkwardly around it like scraggly mountain tops.  
But maybe the house was doomed from the beginning.  The blueprints weren't made right or an angle wasn't calculated correctly.  Why did I waste so much time trying to build something that was already dead?  There were other buildings I could've built, things which aren't calculated wrong and have perfect blueprints.  Why did I choose this little shack?  Did I see hope in it that it might end up being a mansion?  A mansion out of a humble little shack.  Maybe I saw the flawed plans from the beginning but hoped they would change and maybe prove everyone wrong.  
But no.  Flawed plans or a hastily-built house brought it down and it doesn't even resemble what I thought it would."

"event","I know that this is a shitty transition from my last entry but I am seriously considering not playing sax anymore.  
If I didn't play I would be a lot happier of a person.  I wouldn't be as stressed out as I always am because I wouldn't have to practice.  I wouldn't be constantly comparing myself to other musicians.  I would have so much free time.  
And really I don't enjoy playing anymore.  I have always hated practicing, but I just don't get joy from playing in the jazz band.  I am just NOT happy. 
I'm picturing how much extra time I would have if I didn't play.  I would come home every day and have THE ENTIRE night to do homework.  Not do homework AND practice.  It cuts into that time by like 45 minutes.  And at this point, I hate practicing so much that I'm only doing it like twice a week.  
On the other hand, I know that if I quit everyone would be so disappointed in me.  Tom.  Michael.  My parents.   My sister.  My friends.  Playing in band or jazz band looks so good on a college app.  So does playing in festivals.

I also just feel all-around stressed.  With school.  With friends.  With appearance.  
My class is super competitive academia-wise.  There are SO many kids in my grade that are smarter than me and that really bothers me.  I'm supposed to be in the top ten.  I doubt I am.

And although I know I probably won't get in because there are a ton of better saxes out there than me I can still hold out hope that maybe by some fluke the best sax in the state got sick and couldn't come to auditions or I got in by the skin of my teeth.  Really, at this point I would rather get into the jazz band.  I really don't like playing band music.
My band audition went pretty well.  I screwed up in some parts of the song, but overall did very well.  I did very well on the sight-reading too.

We just visited Hampshire College and really, if I wasn't looking at strictly west-coast colleges this would be probably my first or second choice.  The way the school is run is very hippy-esque.

Plus it's really close to Northampton which is a motherfucker of a town."

I was at the sky meadow place, which is the session I'm going to next summer, and it was like in a GIANT house.  Seriously, this thing was like 10 stories.  The inside was dimly lit and made me feel like I was home.  Even though the house was tall, it wasn't very big on the inside and so the place that we all congregated in was small.  There were like 8 ponds outside that were kind of in a step-formation except the first 7 ponds you couldn't swim in.  They were for the fish, of course.
          Jack Shea was at VH with me, but the first night he had to leave to go to a soccer game and then he was coming back.  Why the fuck would Jack EVER go to VH??

Oh where to start?  Well I guess the beginning of high school is a good spot.  I really like it (so far).  None of my teachers are nervy spazoids, and my classes aren't beyond hard.  They are challenging enough.  It is only the first couple weeks, though.  Let's see how stressed I get later.

This is kind of a back-track, but I must confess that Village Harmony was a life-changing experience.

Trying out for the play was fun and I really do hope that by some miracle of the Gods, I get in.  I find out tomorrow.

I don't know what has happened, but Claudia and I have somehow drifted apart.  I didn't even know that it was possible.  Let me tell you a story as to why it maybe has happened though:

Over the summer, she and her dad found God.  And I don't mean just like ""OK, he's there, let's try to ignore him and maybe he'll go away.""  No, this is full-blown born again shit, which I am fine with.  To each his own, right?  Well, I went to church with them once and was blown away.  I mean it was a really cool experience and I can see the appeal.  I may have gotten caught up in the moment and told Claudia that I would go to church with her and be full of religiousnosity, but I soon realized that I do not feel comfortable being that religious.  I believe in God, but I don't want to be a God-fearing person.  I confessed that to her and since then we haven't been the same.  I'm trying to think that that's the only thing, but maybe we are just growing apart.  The sad thing is that I still love her to death and I can't think of anyone else of my best friend.  But I can't stop the inevitable."

"event","I hate waiting.  He says he doesn't want a girlfriends right now, and I can understand that.  But I just hate waiting.  I had to wait almost two years for toren, and that hurt too much.  I don't want to do that again.  
I could see a relationship in our future, not NEAR future, but future.  Possibly april.  But guys are just so unpredictable it could be march of next year.  God, who knows?  I just hate waiting.

I made an alcove in the back of my room.  I put the other curtain I have up so that it is like another room in my room, and turned the adjacent mattress 90 degrees so that it is now part of the big mattress.  I put in my lava lamp and posters and moved the cloud things to the middle of the alcove.  It's amazing.  And very inspiring.  I wrote a DELICIOUS song in it last night.  Inspired by the weakerthans and my alcove."

The lyrics are so random to me, but still so powerful.  I want to write like that.  I am going to try to write like that.  Hospital Vespers could possibly be god.

Hanging out with jonah, klaudia and shelby today was amazing.  We went sledding, and played ping pong and watched zoolander.  It was a very fulfilling afternoon."

I guess I still have SOME feelings for him, but just a tiny crush that should go away if I see him every week.  His hair came back, and he got a thicker mexistash.  It was gross, I wanted to go up to him and shave it off."

"event","I have thought out my entire future.  I will move to Spain after college at Tufts.  I will marry a hot spanish man and have hot spanish babies.  I got this plan because I was listening to American Wedding by Gogol Bordello and it made me realize that american weddings are really boring and cheesy.  That got me thinking about where in the world I could have an exciting wedding.  So I thought of Europe because the rest of the world is pretty poor and I want to thrive.  Then I thought ""not england because that is boring, but I need a place where I speak the language...SPAIN!""  I will study spanish in college to the point where I am fluent, then I will move to spain.  Klaudia will come visit me at my giant huge last until daybreak wedding and then she will be there when I am birthing my hot spanish babies whose names will still be Katya Jezebel and Ami Snorkel Pocket."

Spring needs to come.  I boarded in 45 degree weather today and it was amazing.  It made me miss spring and summer so much.  Maybe that's why I love the song Fling so much.  It reminds me of summer for some reason.  

So I really like him.  Let's see where it takes us.  I don't think it will happen, though.  I try to remain pessimistic.  I think it would be amazing if something comes out of this.  I'm just so tired of being alone.  I'm tired of hearing about everyone else's escapades of love."

"event","I always feel so sad at the end of a year.  These last two years for me have been epic.  I don't want to move on.  But I hope that 2008 will also be epic.

Juno is the perfect beginning to this year.  Definitely my new favorite movie.  I wish I could be like Juno.  Not in the aspect of getting pregnant at 16, but in the aspect of being that witty.  I want to be able to come up with the perfect comebacks and remarks at the drop of a hat.  Maybe someday.

This year I only have one big resolution.  To be more outgoing.  To throw caution to the wind and say ""what have I got to lose"".  Mostly in the boy department, but also with snowboarding and saxophone and just being random.  I have to learn to not care so much about what people think of me.

I just ordered The Moldy Peaches and Damian Marley on amazon.  I am thuper-duper excited."

"event","I hate michigan.  It's depressing and cold, but not the good cold where there is snow and all you want to do is sit in front of the fire in your jammies reading a classic book.  This is the cold that is depressing and there is NO snow, oh but there's ice.  A lot of ice.  It's not the cold that makes you want to sit in front of a fire.  It's the cold that makes you want to thrust yourself into the fire.  
But my relatives are ENTERTAINING. They eat squirrels.  I am not in any way kidding.  They eat squirrels.  And shop at wal-mart everyday.  And some of them even smell like cigarettes from 6 feet away!  Oh yes, michigan.
The only part I enjoyed about this whole wonderful trip was spending time with my should-live-in-vermont-cousins, Amy and Maeven.  They are amazing.  I wish they lived here or closer.  I say they should live in Vermont because Vermont is more suited for them.  They are not rednecks and they are very liberal.  They need to move here.  
And the best part about them is they live in KALAMAZOO.  If that's not good enough for you, they live on SPRINKLE ROAD!!"

"event","Today was good, besides the fact that I think I pretty much failed a math quiz. 
After school, I went into town and played mario kart with Claudia for like half an hour.  We then proceeded to work out, and then got money from my dad.  We went to the movies with Adam, Shelby, Isaiah, Jake and Laila and ran into Toren, Brinton, Zac, and Jonah and his gaggle of preps.  We saw ""I am Legend"" and it was so amazing that I peed a little.  Since my sister is a poo I had to stay in town until 10.  It actually worked out well because I played more mario kart with Laila and then proceeded to go to LSC where a very jew-looking-big-handed-dimple-chinned boy was.  We darted glances at each other, but nothing in fact happened because I am a wimp.

I had a mocha today and am still quite hyper...and full of gassy cramps.

Everyone who reads this, add Claudia...her username is princessklaudia.

In health today Kathy gave us this paper with signs of low self-esteem...and I fit into every single one of the qualifications.  I knew I had super low self-esteem, but to actually have it in front of me, the facts, cut deep.  And now with all of my friends off on the ship leaving me alone on the island to think about my own short-comings, I'm just starting to hate myself in every way possible.  I can't stand to even look at myself in the mirror anymore without thinking about how if I just got rid of this or had a little more of that I would just as pretty as them.  Apparently Claudia and Shelby are the prettiest girls in that class which is funny, because I have tried so hard to not be exposed and compared to things that could make me feel like shit, and I am best friends with the highest up on the totem pole.  I can see them from the bottom, Shelby barely takes the time to wave at me from the top, while Claudia does everything she can to make it seem like we're on the same level.  It makes me feel better in some respects, but in the end, I know I can never be on the same level as her."

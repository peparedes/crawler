So there's something i gotta say
Sometimes life just hits
You sideways, frontways, backways
and From underneath
And it's all just alittle too much
So we gotta keep movin' on
Eventhough
It's hard

Red and Blue
are a catalyst
And they'll start a fire
Let the mother fucker burn
Till' theres nothing left
So watch your ass
And it won't turn out black and blue
Like a nightmare that's real

Gravity works
For you, works against you
For reasons beyond our control
Keep your head on your shoulders
Don't loose your balance
And it'll all be good.

You would think it wouldn't
Make a damn bit of difference
But the bullshit don't always lay low
As long as the radar can't pick it
Up there's no trouble
Nah, no troube here

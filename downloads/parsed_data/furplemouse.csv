FYI Folks,

below posted on 350Z Internet Forum ... be careful!

Not sure how true this is but maybe worth keeping an extra close eye out in the next few weeks.....
                   
Hants Police are doing for a television programme series from the 26th of September for seven weeks.
                   
If you use the M27 or the M3 this potentially affects you so please proceed with caution and pass onto anyone who you feel might just need to know. The program a BBC South commission called ""Traffic Cops"" will be filmed covering the area from Ringwood concentrating on Ringwood M27 up to M3 J9 and a team working the ringroad around Southampton (Totton will have a unit working it alone), Cosham M27 stretch to J5 of the M27. The fourth concentration is working from Winchester Services covering M3 to J10 M3 (Winchester South) using five unmarked cars, two Skoda 03 registration Octavias, an 05 plate dark red Mondeo and two Volvo 
saloon cars.             
                   
The BBC unit are going to be based out of a unit in Millbrook Road in Southampton and will also be covering the armed police response unit and the Southampton Airport Police Security / British Transport Police team. The BBC team are in Citreon Picasso MPVs leased from Arriva.
                   
To make it even more effective the Traffic police have authority from Chief Constable to ""work to rule"" So instead of the laid back approach to the usual Hants traffic police this will be a lot more concentrated to make it effective filming."

"event","My DEAR WIFE:

During the past year I have tried to make love to you 365 times.

I have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of once every ten days.

The following is a list of why I did not succeed more often:


54 times the sheets were clean

17 times it was too late

49 times you were too tired

20 times it was too hot

15 times you pretended to be sleep

22 times you had a headache

17 times you were afraid of waking the baby

16 times you said you were too sore

12 times it was the wrong time of the month

19 times you had to get up early

9 times you said weren't in the mood

7 times you were sunburned

6 times you were watching the late show

5 times you didn't want to mess up your new hairdo

3 times you said the neighbors would hear us

9 times you said your mother would hear us



Of the 36 times I did succeed, the activity was not satisfactory because:



6 times you just laid there

8 times you reminded me there's a crack in the ceiling

4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with

7 times I had to wake you and tell you I finished

1 time I was afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move



KEEP READING.......



==========================================================



TO MY DEAR HUSBAND:



I think you have things a little confused. Here are the reasons you didn't get more than you did:



5 times you came home drunk and tried to screw the cat

36 times you did not come home at all

21 times you didn't cum

33 times you came too soon

19 times you went soft before you got in

38 times you worked too late

10 times you got cramps in your toes

29 times you had to get up early to play golf

2 times you were in a fight and someone kicked you in the balls

4 times you got it stuck in your zipper

3 times you had a cold and your nose was running

2 times you had a splinter in your finger

20 times you lost the notion after thinking about it all day

6 times you came in your pajamas while reading a dirty book

98 times you were too busy watching football, baseball, etc. on TV



Of the times we did get together:


The reason I laid still was because you missed and were screwing the sheets.

I wasn't talking about the crack in the ceiling, what I said was, ""Would you prefer me on my back or kneeling?""

The time you felt me move was because you farted and I was trying to breathe."

I just skimmed through a load of my old journal entries, and boy is it weird digging up all the stuff that used to be in my life, in my head... most of it's not there anymore. The important and loved and cherished remain, obviously, and they are all perfect to me! I love my life, and I think somewhere inside my subconscious I've always had faith that everthing will be fine and happy. The lovely <lj user=""roninkitty""> has been having a stressful time in his mind lately, I think... There was stuff, and I said Well as far as I'm aware, everything's Fine! And it was, and it still is :) Trust my subconscious, I always try to. I'm trusting my first instincts more and more now, since I've never found them to lead me anywhere but the right way. I'm happy for it, too.

God I'm rambling. Thoughts to me are rapidly turning into a nice fresh stream, winding through random little paths through a woody airy place (hm, that sounds like my Mind...)

I want to try something, but I think only my friends are allowed to see me make a mess of this..."

Such a disjointed version of my world this week. I was drying myself in the shower cubicle at the gym yesterday and lost balance, leaning on the water button for support and thus making me and my towel *wet*. Then Nietzche dropped her shiny expensive shampoo and the bottle smashed all over the place. Then they announced the place was closing while we were drying our hair and so we didn't hear and had minor seizures when they turned off the lights... 

I've had my random mood swings today. Was ridiculously happy this morning (was singing to my meese) then slammed straight into irritable and rapidly on to murderous (wanted to kill my irritating and patronising boss) and then blank for a long time, and I seem to have slipped gently into crying for no single apparent reason now.

There's nothing written on my calendar this month. This could be because either nothing's happening or I've forgotten everything. But I'll never know, in any case. So I hope some new stuff presents itself. 

Oh, hang on - <LJ USER = ""cwrmori""> said she'd come by and we could be lame together on Sunday. I think I can manage that! Cookies are definitely in order. 

It's Christmas soon. But not *that* soon... One of my work girlies is stressed cos she's late with her Shopping (she normally has them all wrapped by now) and this *scares* me.  

I'm going to be in my flat by myself for the first time ever soon. Isn't life a whole string of fun learning experiences.

I think it's time to change the subject."

So Pauline wants to get on with me, or so Neil says. This prospect terrifies me. (I had real trouble spelling that part of terrify. Somehow it looks wrong.) But I don't have to face anything for a while at least - tickets for the Ogri Silver bash sold out months ago, and she's taking a random bloke with her. Bullied him into it. I'd have agreed to go too if she'd bullied me... Eep.

I think last weekend was the best for a long time :D it was Sue's birthday barbie pissup. Although I did decide to drive - unwittingly - through hell, with the cat from hell yelling at me all the way... Stupid cat. Anyway, I don't want to remember that bit. Met Neil down the pub thinking I was horribly late and everyone would be waiting for me or already gone, but they weren't even there yet! So I got a pint (or Neil got me one...) then they turned up, so I had to down it. Hm. So then a lot of confusing misorganisation happened, then Al interpreted, and it all made sense! Mel takes Neil home, Al follows with Dave, Chris and Nige. Leave Mel's car, get Neil's beer, all cram into Al's car....... *ouch* but at least they had air con. BBQ!! Food and alcohol :) and a huge Supersoaker fight. Sue's nephew got dunked in the beer fridge... hehehehe, annoying little git!! Anyway, very drunk, and a long walk back to Neil's for all of us. He said it was just down the road. It *so* wasn't!!!!

Nige fell in a ditch full of brambles, and I now have a huge burn hole in my finger :( 

Managed to somehow avoid full on hangover, but Nige didn't. Hehehe >:) but he got better. Mmmmmmm bacon sarnies =) followed by a full on loaf day. Others all went home (Alison really needed her baby to have his breakfast...!) and Neil and I stared at all of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, followed by a venture out for fried chicken and then munching back home in front of the Matrix. So relaxing and happy :)

Going to the gym tonight - proper workout now we've had our personal trainer sessions. Mine was lovely! Nietzchi's was a bit mean... We're taking the boys with, since it's free to sign in on Fridays. Should be interesting! I'm really looking forward to my shower. I think I'm developing a clean fetish - much more so than normal. Or maybe it's just all the yicky weather that I can't escape from. Bleah.

So what do you wear to a pseudo-Pimms cocktail party in an orchard?? I have to find something tomorrow morning for Dave's. I'm driving George, and possibly Ruth, and I have no idea what we'll wear! Hmm. Goth and mostly Metal turning to Pimms advert....... Taking camera!!

I still need help though.

Got to do work early tomorrow morning.

And I'm still confuszed."

Friday was an unexpected night of Supremeness, though, I must admit :D I discovered lots of stuff I remember liking now!

Also, we managed to unwittingly avoid that stupid power in the park thing by being off the mainland. Ha. Don't think lots of screaming cack in my garden would have been good for morale at all......

I discovered how much I weigh, too. Not good, although has been worse. Time to go to the gym next week. Also might be an idea to stop eating crap. Hm.

So since we were staying out Saturday night, and can't really let the CyberKitti out for fear of nasty infections in his implants.... I fed him lots before we left. Thought I'd empty a whole tin on to his dish after having given him breakfast, so he'd be full and not eat it or something. But no. He ate it all. I had to put out another tin... And he ate rather a lot of that too. TubbyKitti!! And the first thing he said when I got back in was ""ah, you must be here to feed me"" Natch.

Here's me looking forward to seeing my new buddy George again :D"

Hmmm.... stupid test thing. Anyway, I'm not a goth. I'm me :0)

I feel supremely energised this week, and I think it's mostly thanks to 101 on Tuesday!! Got me back to myself again - being out and happy and with people :D

I want to try and get to Subgoth on Friday 13th ( sweet ) but don't actually know Portsmouth. PFF - although not quite sober - expressed vague interest in coming with, as did ME (excellent - love the name!) but I think a lot of different alcohols were probably speaking at once. Well here's hoping... I think going out more than once this month would have positive effects =]

Now I've written it somewhere I'm slightly less likely to forget about it. My god, if I could remember to I'd be worried about myself."

"event","What a supreme night!! I almost felt like myself today, for the first time in what seems like years (but may only be since the club closed....) I used to love dressing up and going out drinking and dancing, meeting people through random babbling and discovering I've actually known of them for too long to have not spoken before =/

Um. Yeah. Had a brain-free day today. Been stumbling round like a zomby but didn'tfind any brains. Ooh - Nietzche and I had a great loaf on Sunday!!! I hired Night of the Living Dead and Mulan :D and bought flavoured foam and sliced melon. We used this concoction, and improved it by adding a lot of extremely strong joints. Oh so yummy =]

Bloody hell. Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner is more than one song's worth of time and notes...

I went to Tesco and collected up loads of necessary foody stuff, then she said Pay Me Money and then I discovered I'd left my wallet in my leather from last night. How embarrassed? Far too much. They had to put all the bits back... And I'm hungry. And so's the CyberKitti. *sigh* I'm too dumb for this.

I miss too many people. But on a plus side, I am meeting and becoming closer to others :) I love people. Well the ones I like, anyway. I hate the rest. Rrrr. Like the Fucker that keeps nicking my space. Stupid Essex Wideboy failure... *mutter mutter* I mean who has a Fiesta with the word ""sorted"" in metal letters instead of ""Fiesta""???! Good grief.

I want to see Anthrax. Which reminds me..."

Our baby gets to go to hospital in six weeks to have his cyber implamnts removed  =D and he's allowed to go slay (as best he can minus his fangs...) in the garden again now, which he will be most pleased about.

I want time to go lots faster, at least for the next year. Then I can have my snacky qualifications and go for a new shiny job Somewhere Else and get paid Lots and attempt to buy a house!!!! But I shall have to make do with being massively in debt and asocial and unfit (completely unrelated, but still getting me down) for the forseeable future. Or for the next year. Whatever is longest =[ 

And I have no short term memory worth mentioning, coupled with negligable and unreliable long term memory. I need help. Really. But what the hell would I say to a doctor?? In response to ""so how long has this been going on?"" I'd have to say either ""I don't know"" or ""I don't remember""... Very bloody helpful."

Wow!! This weekend actually rocks!! (Apart from one *major* disaster on Friday night, which is thankfully rectifying now, slowly...) 

Saw Children of Bodom on Friday night =D George drove - he's lovely :) and we all got pissed and soaked!! And walked through the aftermath of some kind of brawl on Tooting high street, but were pissed enough not to care!! Ha. Then I got home - around 1am, I think, and something horrible hit me. Then J told me Ronin had a showdown with a car, and had just been rushed to the emergency vet surgery with a broken jaw and fluid on his lungs, with a 50% chance of surviving. We cried. Had to go and take him to another different vet before 8.30 Saturday morning, and he looked so broken =(

Went to Somerton on Saturday afternoon and changed into Medieval outfits, then convoyed up to Warwick castle and drank lots and ate *loads*, took pictures too =) 

Sunday was a day of loaf =] we had huge food - again - and stared at gone in 60 seconds, rock star (which I *love*!!) resident evil then trawled home in baking sun (bleah. Had to stop at Newbury to air sweat out of clothes...) ate more then met MB at the Odeon for X2 again!!! I adore Kurt - he's the perfect - and cutest - gentleman :) Back to MB's for drinking and ridickerous Cheapass games and alcohol (for the boys, not me. Too much for this month already!)

And now we prepare to eat. AGAIN!!! My god, I'll not be able to fit out the door soon. Must join cheap gym........"

I just woke up from the meanest headache... Made my head spin and my stomach squirm, and I passed out on the bed to the sound of posessive purring!

Still don't rate this weekend much... Guess one positive thing will be the vast amount of overtime I'll be getting, if RR manages to remember to get the paperwork off to the relevant department this time! Ooh - *remembers* - he forgot last month's, so *lots* of overtime this month!! Woohoo =D"

I had the stupidest most pathetically depressing day yeaterday. Not in a major way, just all the little ridiculously dumb things happened at me.  up and put the wrong boots on (only realised this ten mins after I left the house...) then slammed the door with my house and car keys still inside. Had to go to work on the bus - never done this before, so had to wander round looking for the right bus stop first. Surprisingly only half an hour late for work =]

Caught bus to town to go see Nietzche until J got home at half seven, only to find my phone had fallen out my pocket on the bus, and *ran* back to said bus, with the driver watching, who decided to drive off as I reached the door. !!*%$&**!!!#@@#!!!!AAAAARGH

Was a bit cross, rapidly turning to tears as I realised I'd lost all my best meassages and everyone's numbers. Must call depot...

Then I left my ultra cool lunchtime reading purchase (the Terrorizer Thrash Special!!! :D ) at Nietzche's place. Bah. To quote one of my all time most respected and revered favourite people - it's the little things that piss me off.

I miss my life."

I knew it had to pay off =D Now all I need to do is work on the rest... 

I need more ca$h. I also need ideas, in order to facilitate the frist part of this sentence. Rrrr. Everything's so bastard complex.

On a lighter note - work was great today! Apart from when I got my finger crushed in a door... But I always suffer some kind of minor injury at some point during my day. That's natural for me. Boss is in Lanzarote for a week, and for some reason we've had a lot *more* work but have been *less* busy...??? Hm. He didn't do much when he was here - as far as we could tell. All he seems to do is look for stuff and get stressed/flustered and is in a perpetual state of crazy disorganisation! 

mmm mmm mmm and whisper Love Is Forever.... yaya I love this song =]

I wanna go out. I wanna be rich enough to afford to... Rrrrr.

Oh - and Grrr. You know who You are ;0P

Ooh - found out today (ok - I worked here 5 months and didn't discover this before... ObliviousMel) that I get two pay rises a year - and one's on my birthday!!! *YAY* I like my job a little more now. I loved it until The Powers That Dictate had their little say last week, when I began considering my fourth Midlife Crisis career change style move, but now I'm considering liking it enough to think about staying for *shock* more than a year! (I never stayed at a job for more than a year before...) As KC pointed out today - I will be in a much better place in a couple of years' time (alien concept =/) if I stayed and got the pay increments than if I left and started at the bottom of yet another new place all over again. Hm. Hmmmmmmm. 

Far too many people are thinking about war.

Sun - contrary to what I'd like to believe - does wonders for making life seem Not That Bad After All! Coming home from work with windows open enjoying warmth and happy thoughts about gabbering about in Salisbury or Corfe or the New Forest or just generic countryside somewhere =D I think I must have been some kind of cynical Druidess of the order of Cynical Realism or something... Lust for nature coupled with impressive coincidence abilities and massive cynicism regarding anything non-scientific. Go figure. 

I also want better salary. Been thinking about all life's little bastard problems, and that would be the foundation for them, I think... More money means I can afford a gym membership, which means I'll get slimmer, fitter and more confident and outgoing, which means I'll want to go out and bounce with friends and people, which means I'll want to go buy lots more sexy clothes and *I'll be able to afford lots*!! Rrrr. I miss Dave, I miss going out and being Slutty (not the conventional meaning of the word, which is just slutty. Very distinct difference.)

Organised sport, come to think of it, is the downfall of society as a whole. This has been my heartfelt opinion for some time now, since the bloody FA qurter final just down the road and such like... *scum*

"event","It's all gone nasty.

I couldn't do it. Just couldn't face the thought of physically being seen, which causes a big problem seeing as going out and seeing friends is what I really need. I never thought this could happen to me - I've always been so social, always out with mates and seeing people. Lately it all seems to be going wrong, oddly enough since I last moved.

Life sucks. The only thig today has going for it is that I get paid."

"event","Where is everyone? Why when I need some light hearted friendly company can I never reach anyone? I think if I could just wander past the Club tonight, to see if anyone was ther... Or if I could just drop in and say hi to friends, join in with a bit of life. You're all so far away though. I miss you all muchly. It's a long way to go and a lot of trouble (with present state of mind...) to find nobody. 

Distance sucks.  

And today was my worst day at work ever, no contest. Not even that time when I left in tears, only to be signed off for two months with psychological mess to clear up, was even close to today. 

I really want to get dressed, go out, and see the small handful of people I love so much. Wonder if I'll make it..."

"event","I can't seem to break through the barriers I've just realised have been forming in me for ages. Someone wouldn't notice their eyesight going for a long time if it faded slow enough... (I should know - my stubborn sister refuses to correct hers in any way because it's legal, technically. The fact that she can't read road signs, and therefore is ok on roads she knows but when it comes to new ones..... Well, she ended up halfway to Wales when trying to come down to Southampton to visit me once. We're very similar, really, though this scares me more than most things should.)

I've gone as far as attempting to compile a motivating cheerful type tape so I'm more likely to end up exuding endorphines  when (if...) I finally get round to joining a gym type institution. The girls at work say the one on site is small and pleasingly cheap - quid a session, I think, with a personal trainer available too. I have a lot to push myself through before I could even consider personal trainer status (and I do mean using one, not becoming one.) 

I'm scared now I can see what Ive been hiding from myself. Now I know why it was hidden - ick. So tempting to just shove the rubble back into some sembleance of a heap, more to bury fears than to rebuild any decent wall that was there before, and turn round and try to walk away and forget about it all. Which would be fine if I lived on this planet alone. But frankly, since the likelihood of that ever happening, I'll have to face the ugliness.

Suddenly it dawned on her - she has always had the mentality of someone with a serious psychological disorder, like anorexia, for instance, but never even had the strength of mind to be able to avoid the lard bombs disguised as nutrition. *disgusted*
I'd like to see someone trained in something relevant try to unravel the crumpled flypaper in my mind. I want it all flattened out so I can see what's stuck in it that shouldn't be, and vice versa."

I wish I had the strength, willpower, guts or even sheer bloody mindedness to be able to just say Fck It All and just walk away (metaphorically) from the petty confusion and powerplay."

After months of looking forward to what I thought promised to be the best weekend of the year, it's actually pretty much ruined everything. Nothing has worked, nothing has gone right, nothing is left intact. All I'm clinging to now is desperate hope and memories, and to quote someone whose name I don't know - ""you can't put your arms around a memory"""

"event","so i went out in a limo saturday night for my birthday.....the limo was completly nuts. all my cousions and i rented a limo and went to luckeys in novi's fountian walk park.. needless to say i got completly drunk off my ass after 7 beers and 2 long island ice tea's. those things are powerful and beautiful. i really dont remember the ride back but im sure i had fun considering all the pictures ive seen so far. sunday night hamblin, wells, hiner, and i went to emagine in canton and saw blade trinity. it was a cool movie. the best part about that theater is their 32oz beers. the worst part is you can only have two. after the movie we went to bww's and the guys had 24 wings. I wasnt really hungry so i had 2 of their 22oz beers...mmmmmm mmmmm good. ive come to the realize i love beer. i love it!! the taste like kissing a  virgins......... . anyway no one really needs to worry about me honestly. sence im 21 now my parents have been pretty cool about everything. i actully tell them the truth when i leave. i like not having to lie to them about why i didnt come home or call them when i was late...that type of stuff. 
    i retook my hearing test for the military and i passed parts i didnt before. its all a waiting game now to see if they will use this new test or the old one. i hope i can get into the pararescue or combat control. something along those lines. like  justin foust i wouldnt mind goin into law to be a csi. or maybe work with the fbi when i get out. that would be sweet. 
   Other then that my life has been pretty normal. oh... all i hear in stores is ""jingle bells....."" oh man. i can not even explain how much i hate chirstmas music. one more thing. if your at the mall and you see some  kid in a black ranger cutting everyone off to get in and out of the parking lot thats me...sorry"

"event","I think this past weekends was one of the most insane time of my life... I went up to Northwood University with my cousin Dave. Before we even got there, we were drunker then anything. We went to a friends parties where I drank about 1/2 gallon of jungle juice(remember Im already drunk).  The last thing i remember is Finishing the jj off and talking to madison b. I wake up in the morning with no clue what happened outside a medical clinic. I was still really drunk and it was about 6 or 7am. I dont know what i was doing, but i was trying to break into the medical center where it was warm. I finally gave up and called madison. I was walking over his apt when i realized i was limping, my head had a huge bump on it, and my arms were all cut up. I got to his apt and just passed out till 3pm. Later that day when I met up with some friends their parents made me go to the hospital. After that I tried to peice my night together. It turns out that I was walkin out side on the deck and tripped, fell off the deck, hit my head on a tree and cut my arms all up. After that they found me wandering out in the woods where i got my poison ivy. Were still not sure how i sprained my ankle, but needles to say who really cares after i hit a tree with my head. After that we went to a bar and started all over again. I tried my hardest to stay sober that night, but one yeager bomb led to another, you know  how that goes.. Then we went back to some kids house and drank till 5 or 6 am. It was a fun weekend. Sorry pat for the toby keith thing. I feel bad and will make it up to you soon. I also realized this weekend that I really dont drink that much compared to others. Anyway I guess thats all for now."

"event","Its been along time sence ive updated this.... Alot has happened in the like of dan pauls. Ill tell the good ones first.... country country concerts have been amazing this summer. This was my fav summer of all time for concerts and just hangin out with friends. i went to the dixie chicks concert the other day and it was a rally for John Kerry, fuck that doushe. It was fun though. Ever ernce i got my brothers ID, my life has been better. Alan Jackson was a blast +1. I guess i might of gotten a lil outta hand but thats ok. I dont remember alot about the night though. i guess i huged a guys wife and he got pissed, but oh well. Jessica was there, but that ended that night. which was good! Hiner, dave, brent, and i were at wells house and i was passed out in hiners truck so they got me outta the truck and stood me up and i just fell to the ground and said, ""I hate jesus"". I think thats the worst thing i could oh said it my life, i dont hate jesus, hes a good guy.(before the concert i had 3 beers, 1/2 a pint of southern confort, and 1/2 a pint of pucker. in the concert about 5 big tall beers.) so i wwas pretty much wasted. I woke up at 6am with my mom pounding on my truck door. I woke up and asked her what she wanted as i smoked an unlit cig. she told me to get out and then started asking all these questions that i couldnt answer. Needless to say it wasnt good. 
    Im now goin into the Air Force after my sister get married in April. Im really excited about it. I think i want to get my degree in law or something like that, but that might change tommarow. I would love to get the chance to be in special opps and be able to do recon missions or fly plans. Its all up in the air right now..
      today if friday and its a great day to be alive. i think i might go to ann arbors bars and see whats goin on out there. then tommarow, is toby keith, which i dont have tickets to but i plan on goin, and getting the shitty seats and find open good seats. Either way ill have fun and be in a happy frunk mood... good by to all"

 Lots has been goin on in the life of dan pauls lately. Katie and i are back together and shes ok with all the choices that i make. she a good girl. well, the tim mcgraw and big and rich concert was amazing. I danced my heart out with people i didnt even know. we took a charter bus there so no one would make bad choices and drive home trashed. we deff need that bus 8 cases finished by 17 guys before we got there to dte. then it went from there. i went to the montgomery gentry concert a month in a half ago or so. it was fun i lost my ride and rode home with random girls. last weekend i went to john michael montgomery it was a scary. Myself and friends had 3 cases so we decided to tail gate. well come to find out, they are not letting people tailgate at dte now. so a cop came outta no where and asked who was 21, no responce. i thought i was gettin an mip for sure. he gave us option a and b. 50 beers in a cooler(parents cooler). choice A) take the beer give us mips and kick us out.Choice b) take are beer and go directly into the show. we took B. then i asked the cop if i could get my cooler back and he told me if its my cooler im gonna get a ticket so i let the fuck head take it. finding a cooler exactly like it wasnt easy so i got one really colse to it. last night i went to the evanessence concert they played with three days grace and seether and someother band we missed. three days grace and seether were actually pretty good. amy lee is a really good live performer. there were alot of fucked up people there. gothic kids pullin each other on leashes, cross dressers. gag me. it was good seeing justin, patty and hammy last night, fun times. i think im getting the boot outta my house or ill just leave on my own will. home life sucks my parents are assholes most of the time. im gonna live in my truck for the rest of my life...hmmm that would be fun. it was good seeing justin, hamblin, and haney last night havent been able to hang out in a while. works a bitch. well i gotta go do something for someone."

"event","Well last night i got home at 1am and couldnt sleep so i watched a movie. At 330am the phone rang and it was my mom at the hospital with my uncle butch. for those who dont know who butch is he my handicapped great uncle/ brother. he moved in with us when my great grandma couldnt take care of him or herself. he has a cold/virus already and they put him on new meds to try to stop those things. My dad talked to my mom and relayed the message to me. he was feeling dizzy so my mom took him up to the hospital and they are running tests on him. the thing that i cant stand is the doctors can tell somethings wrong with him, but they cannot figure out what it is. they have a few guesses though. Ulcer, cancer, or allergic reaction to the meds. They found blood in his stout(poo), which is no good. but the doctor said thats mostlikely from his virus that makes him cough and possibly scratched is throat or a bloody nose. I just dont know what i would do if anything happened to him. his the nicest guy in the world. they are still at the hospital and that concerns me. 14 hours of running tests and they cant figure out whats wrong with him. please pray for butch and the doctors so he can get out of the hospital and back on his feet again!"

"event","well yesterday was fun. i got to see hamblin, patty, and tyler, which was cool. got  to see hamblins new home its pretty tight. then gigi called me cuz she needed to talk to someone. hope everything goes well with that. Then went out to a buddies cabin and had a few to drink. All in all it was a fun night. someone there gotta a lil outta hand and took off their pants. I saw jodie(HOT). It was the first time i saw her sence a big party last summer(it was a blast). I she gave me her digits to give her a call tonight, so i will do that, cuz she asked me to!! I think i need to start cutting back on the smokeage. Im startin to get that nasty smokers cough, and thats not cool. my goal is to become a guy who only smokes when he drinks. we'll see how that goes. then when i was good to drive home I left and a cop fly by me doin 75 in a 45. damn kids! i let my buddie know to go inside and chill there for a bit till they saw the popo go by. nothing happened so all is well. got home at 230am the rents were sleepin like uasual. i felt tired and went to bed! This morning was a ruff one i woke up at 950am(oh shit) and threw cloths on and ran outta the house. left the house and got stuck behind 2 model T's that were goin 25 in a 55. So i was 5 min late for work, not bad. first time i was late in like 3 weeks. 1 more hour till i get off(maybe). my parents might sell our whitmore lake store, but the guy who wants to buy it wants me to work with him for 90 to 180 days. so its up to me if i want to do that. If i dont he wont buy the store. I feel like my parents are pressuring me into all this(which they are), but tell me its my choice, make a wise one Daniel. The guy seems cool, but it will be different. I wouldnt be able to take a day off for 180 days or so and he might change the hours on my so it will be NO LIFE FOR DANIEL FOR 180 DAYS. And he might be open on sundays so i would have to work 7 days a week, that means no partin over the summer. looks like i have a tuff one on my hands. Well im outtie for now...till next time mates."

My day went well till i was warming up for soccer. the ball got stuck in the net so i jumped up to get it and landed on my alreeady sprained ankle, which sucked. it hurt very much so. some worker saw me do it and tryed to make me go off the field for legal issues, but i told him it didnt hurt, so i lied to that bastard! so i had to play goalie cuz my darn ankle. durning the game i went to make a save and used my bum ankle and twisted it. Then some guy with an amazing shot blasted the ball at me and i saved it cuz it was goin right for you know where, my penis. i blocked my special spot with my arms and as i was taking a shower this morning i noticed a bruse from the hit. then i thanked god that i save my penis from gettin hit!!!!!    thursday was dousey.. same ole shit, just another day. after work we got a poker game goin which was fun, i lost 10 bucks, but it happens. watched the wings game also.

Then the good ole rents showed up and yelled at me and told me that drinking happy drinks is stupid, ha what do they know. I told them as long as im safe when i do that they have nothing to worry about. Why would they go trash pickkin to find out i do that, they thought i was a perfect child and i ruined that for them, sorry mom and dad. so now they are leaving for europe on sunday and i gots the house to my self... waahhooo, party!! nope no party cuz there will be people randomly stoppin by my house, but ill get a poker game goin for sure! then we can chill and have some HAPPY DRINKS.

"event","Well its a busy day for me today! I started my day off by waking up ahh 30 min late, so basically i woke up at 10 and i had to be at work at 10,hmm oh well. AWW man Im so Mad. I bought the spinners for the ""Operation Geo"", and one fell off already. dang cheep crap spinners. They also only sell them in sets of 4, all i need is one. gosh darnit! Other then that all is well here. Oh ya Happy St. Patty's day to all. Be safe on a holiday like this one. I have a soccer game tonight, so that should be fun. Last weeks game a fatso plowed into me and i think i pulled or streched a muscle in my back cuz it hurts like a mother fer. Oh, My grandma also told me that I am like 15% Irish. I was excited until i remembered the potato famine in Ireland. That means some of my relatives might have suffered, and that makes me sad. Then again I really wouldnt like to eat potato's all my life. Thanks to all my Irish family that left there, so i could eat ramen noodles. I think im gettin a raise in the next few days, so thats cool. i might be goin to SAU this fri, weather depending, to see the video the guys made. If its nice out im gonna go down to telegraph, because thats alot closer. I got offered a beer today by the owner of a business. I just saved him 1000 dollars on his phone bills. I declined the offer on the beer, cuz i am not of age yet and couldn't go to the bar and have a cold one. Oh well, im over it! The other night i told a kid that he could kick my car for 5 bucks, he told me he was broke. I responded 25 cents will do. So he bumed money off a friend and kicked my car. OUCH. well i gots go go"

"event","So last night we were supposed to play poker, but that didnt work out cuz' the guys said girls were commin over. well it ended up being a bunch of guys and 2 girls. it felt like a  sausage fest, but i kept my distance then i started to feel funny and went home to sleep. I woke up today and my head hurt and my stomach aches.hmmm. oh well. mother nature is a bia, she needs to make up her mind. i think im goin to finally puttin on my 14's and goin to to get my spinners later today. so that will be fun. i think i might make a job change. I met this hot stripper last night and she makes tons of money. i could prob get a job at danny's in canada. hmm, nope that would be gay. So maybe ill be a drug dealer and make 500 a day sitting at home. then those there cops will arrest me and ill get put into jail and thats one sausage fest i dont want to deal with. We'll every job that i want would turn out to be something gay so it looks like im not changing jobs. maybe part-time stripper wouldnt be too bad.. man oh man what a night"

I told my dad id but a car if i could get 3000 dollars off it. then sell it to get the SRT-4.

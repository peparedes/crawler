It's the usual suspect this time--a casual stroll through DeviantArt's good avenues drove a pike into my at-the-time vulnerable ego.

One enlists in the army, another is accepted to a distant technical university, and one stays behind.  The story follows their individual comings of age as they try to adapt with their new and constantly changing worlds, especially when the conflict abroad comes much, much closer to home.<br /><br />And it's a fantasy epic.<br /><br />This is one of the first paintings I've tried without using pressure-dependent opacity on the brush, and I have to say, it feels much more controlled and solid.  If you look at some of my other paintings (<a href=""http://randyquiros.livejournal.com/2131.html"">The May 31 post, in particular.</a> But it's much more evident in pictures I haven't posted.) there's always a glut in shades, all due to the spontaneity in the brush's opacity.  Colors are mixed haphazardly and with little thought, leaving me with pretty bad stroke economy.<br /><br />This way is different, though.  A good portion of the hues and values you see here were hand-picked and actually flatted.  Only after did I start blending, and this time by manually changing brush opacity.  It feels much more like pixelling this way, and the result feels more solid and sharp than usual.<br /><br />&lt;/artfag&gt;"

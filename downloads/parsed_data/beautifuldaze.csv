"event","So tomorrow Nathan moves into Pitt, Saturday I move into IUP. I guess this is offically the end of summer. :-( Summer of 2004, probably one of the best summers I've ever had in my entire life. It started off on a bad note, considering the differences with Hello Radio. Graduation came, which was a fun time for all. Most of my days were spent in Indiana with my amazing boyfriend, Nathan, and Rachel and our crazy drives around...bubbly in the grove? June went by slow with not many exciting things happening. July came and I spent the 4th with Nathan, Dave and Noelle. Watching fireworks on the top of a hill with bubbly...shooting fireworks off and than having fun in the hot tub ;-) First time in 7 years my 4th of July didn't suck. Orientation sucked, but than it was off on tour. Tour...wow. I don't think I can think of any words to describe. First night I woke up in a Walmart parking lot in Cleveland. And it just went on from there. I met so many awesome people, and saw many ""different"" things. Once I got back from tour it was more spending time with Nathan, hanging out with rockstars backstage at Warped tour, and than it was off to vacation. Than to top off everything Nathan and I took a road trip to Rochester...drunk Jason and lead singer Tony... This summer was just filled with so much random stories, awesome times, and drunk Jason. 

The best part of this whole summer though had to be all the time I spent with my amazing boyfriend. After tour and everything else that was put in our way we definitely realized we can make it through anything. College will be a breeze for us. We have so many awesome memories together and we have so many more to come. I love you Nathan Cole, always and forever. College here I come."

"event","This past weekend was amazing. What an awesome way to end the summer...I went up to Nathan's on Wednesday and got to hang out with everyone, Rachel, Dave, Noelle, and the whole gang. Then on Friday Nathan and I went up to Rochester and went to the practice space and I got to see everyone! I was so excited. Then Saturday Jason had to work in the morning so Nate and I went out to lunch with Jack and Tony, after that we drove around some looking at the beauty of Rochester with a little Walmart adventure with Tony. Nate and I ended up venturing back to Jason's house to chill until he got released from work. That night Jason and Nathan both got wasted...Jason more than Nathan of course. I love Nathan so much, it was an awesome weekend and I'm glad I got to share it with him. I've decided that I will be going up to Rochester at least once a month while I'm at school. Next Rochester stop is the weekend after Labor Day...here I come."

"event","I'm missing a lot of people right now. Nathan, Rachel, Dave, everyone up in Indiana. I went on another shopping spree tonight, everyone hate my trendy ass, I bought a pair of jeans at hollister that are pre-ripped. Thing that sucks is Hollister is running their sizes extremely small, which means I'm feeling really fat now, and have to go back to get a bigger size. I got some sweet sweaters at Pac Sun and 3 cool scarfs today. Some more polo shirts and a new hat, like my black one but white. I think the merch guy for Never Heard if It has one...Kyle, that drunk bastard. 1 more full day till I'm with my loves again! Than 3 more full days till I'm with my other loves again, my boys in rochester. I can't wait to get hugs from all of them again. And give them their awesome gifts that I got at the beach. I'll make sure to take lots of pictures. 

I basically have everything pack for school, the sad thing is you can't even tell by looking in my room. I never really noticed how much stuff i collected over the years, until it's time to move out. I have to help Nathan pack on wednesday...to much packing not enough fun!! My boyfriend is the best, he can always make me feel like the most beautiful girl in the world...plus the luckiest because I have him. *"

"event","So we got back from vacation today, thankgod. I had an awesome time spending 2 weeks with Nathan, but spending a week with my family was hell. Everyone this year seemed to be extra annoying. The only family members that didn't get on my nerves were my cousins who are 1 1/2. They can't talk. Tomorrow Nate goes back up to Indiana, which will be a little hard probably since I've seen him every day for 2 weeks. But I'll be going up there on Wednesday, and than on Friday him and I are off to Rochester, NY. I'm really stoked about that because I miss those crazy boys so much!!! I can honestly say tour was probably one of the most exciting times I've had in the past couple of years. Just to spend so much time with some of my good friends in a van traveling around was more than I could ask for. Nate and I spent a good hour organizing my room more for when I move out in 2 weeks. I'm excited that I'm going to be able to hang out with Rachel and Dave whenever, but sad because I'll have to start studying again, and all that stupid school stuff. 

So apparently the website for the company is gone, so that sorta sucks. I'll have to work on that, which also sucks! Or should I really work on that, the company is basically being put in recess for a year since I'll just be focusing on One Year Nothing and Chad Fell Down probably so there really is no need for an In the Pit website. Who knows...

Warped Tour was amazing. I ended up getting 2 backstage passes and spent the afternoon back behind the mainstages hanging out with all of those bands. Nate and I got to watch Coheed, Bouncing Souls, Anti-Flag, NFG, Yellowcard, Sugarcult and more from the back of the stages they were playing on. It was his first backstage experience so I'm glad it was a good one. I got to talk to Pat from Anti-Flag who also runs A-F records, and him and I are going to be meeting in September to talk about maybe me working with AF records. Which would be fucking sweet, because it's pretty big time stuff. Just having a meeting with them is huge enough. Who would have thought a year ago from July when I started this company up that it would get so big so fast. I mean it's not huge but it's a lot more advanced than I expected it to be at this point. I've had so many awesome experiences the past year because of this company. The Ups and Downs (hello radio) of management, many awesome backstage experiences (yellowcard, sensesfail, moneen, etc.), performing on stage at club laga in front of a sold out crowd (sensesfail), meeting so many awesome people, getting the ""rockstar"" treatment, growing up and becoming more mature, making friends all over the country, going on tour (one year nothing) and than being offered to go across seas on tour (never heard of it), and getting the royal treatment at warped tour and hanging out with the ""rockstars"" of today. All in all I'm glad I put so much into this company because I have gotten so much out of it. Man I'm just rambling on right now...like it's over or something, but it's really just beginning. A new adventure is just right around the corner. .... destination beautiful."

Nathan and I are having an awesome time on vacation and are sad to see it end. Our new favorite past time is yatzee and scrabble, and skeeball at the arcade. I got this awesome Split hoodie for 20 bucks at the outlets, and got One Year Nothing the coolest gifts I think. Nathan bought me a nice ring today, and some things for my dorm room, which I thought was really sweet. Plus he woke me up with breakfast in bed this morning. I have the best guy. 

So I move into Indiana in about 2 weeks...a little nerve racking I guess. I'm excited because I'll get to see Rachel EVERYDAY!!!! Without boys intrupting us! Whoo hoo, Rachel is one of the few girls I can hangout with and not be annoyed with. Its awesome, I love her to death. She got very lucky lately and landed a really awesome guy...congrats!!!!!

"event","It's funny how some people are ruining their lives trying to be ""cool"". Drinking everything in site, and smoking so much pot they can't move. It seriously makes me sad. So talked to IUP a couple of days ago about doing concerts up there...it's a no go. The bastards want me to pay $100 per hour, that includes load in and load out times so that would be 7 hours...at the min. which is $700 there.  Than add on sercurity for 8 a hour that's over $100 there for two, than they want me to pay insurance for the company...but not through them I would have to go get my own insurance which means I would be spending hundreds there. It's not worth it, I'd much rather go back to Pittsburgh and do a show at Mr. Smalls. So I asked the dude that if the Skate Club was behind me would it be that much and he said they have no budget for shows. Who is he to say they don't have the budget. Damn IUP I dislike it already. 

So with all that said I've come to a conclusion. In the Pit this year will no longer be booking shows. I'm going to be spending most of my time focusing on one band as the management role...That band will be announced in late August."

"event","So i'm offically home from tour as of last night. The boys left Pittsburgh today though, I miss them so much already! It sucks ass. Tour was amazing, even though there was a lot of bad ""luck"" that happened. I went through 2 phones and lost my right globe shoe. I'm actually really pissed about my shoe. There are so many different stories I could tell about tour, but I can't decide what to tell and what not to. We got to meet a lot of bands, but my favorite one we met was Never Heard of It. They are really pop punk but awesome guys. We got to party with them up in New Jersey. I rented out a suite for the night and it was forty night. Their merch guy, Kyle, passed out on my bed, and I was screaming in his face and he wouldn't wake up. NHOI has a rule if you pass out with your shoes on you get your face drawn on...I felt bad but it was funny. Their new guitar player Dan is an awesome guy, him and I spent some time together, It's cool to have some friends in LA now if I decide to move out there for a year or two for school. Rachel and I might go see NHOI on sunday, it's debatable right now, waiting for Dan to give me a call back.

Even though I miss touring like crazy I'm so happy to be home cause now I can get things back to normal with Nathan. I'm going up there tomorrow and will probably be staying for a week. I missed him so much and can't wait to just sit with him and watch TV again cuddling. I'm making us dinner tomorrow night and we are going to watch a movie, dinner and a movie what a wonderful way to welcome him and I back together. We leave for the beach in a week, I can't wait it's going to be so much fun!! We will be celebrating 4 months than, it seems like it's so much longer I love him soooo much!!"

"event","So I'm sitting here again in the Days Inn located in wonderful Cleveland, Ohio. Today was crazy we woke up right at checkout time, but still all had to take showers, so 2 hours later we finally leave the Days Inn. We drove to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and ended up just sneaking down to the bottom floor and looking at the guitars. It cost $18 to get in, craziness something the guys don't have considering we still have 2 full weeks to go on tour. After the RnRHF we went over to the Science Center right by it, but only to stay for a total of probably 5 minutes. Than off to the Cleveland Browns Stadium, which has a Hall of Fame in it. So all in all we saw a lot of things for free today. The show was better than last night, but the guys feel that they didn't play up to par. I disagree but everyone is picky when it comes to something they love so much. Tomorrow we are off to Youngstown, OH and than after that I dunno, I think maybe New Jersey. 

Nathan got a new tattoo today, it's pretty sweet,  but really big. He sent me a picture right after he got it done. Anyways I miss him and can't wait to see him!"

MWF I don't have to wake up till 11:45 and than on Tuesday and Thursday my first class is 9:45, 2 classes a day, I can't complain. On the 3rd Nate and I spent the night hanging out with Dave and Noelle, we watched the fireworks and drank some bubbly. Than on the 4th while Rachel and I were out to lunch we found out the boys (one year nothing) were in Pittsburgh so right after Nate got out of work we all drove down to Pittsburgh and hung out with OYN. It was the best 4th of July I've had in a long time, and it's all because of my caring boyfriend being a sweetheart and coming down with me. Jason was completely wasted and wanted to steal a fireman's jacket, and oh yeah he had sex with his girlfriend and the condom broke...haha. Nathan's parents are so awesome, his mom gave me play doh, a haircut thing and a drill and fill playset to go with it! Than since we are dorks Nate and I went out and bought Mario Kart for N64 and spent the rest of the weekend playing that. I didn't get to see the kittens so i'm still mad about that. Saying goodbye today was harder than it has ever been, I don't even want to imagine what it will be like on Monday.

I leave for tour Monday, and hopefully if I can get this wireless internet stuff working I'll be updating this daily. So keep checking back for news from the road. Peace."

I'll probably be joining up with them on July 6th (when they are in Pittsburgh), than staying with them for the rest of the tour, which is until the end of July. It's going to be awesome, Will showed me the dates yesterday and I'm going to Florida!!!! haha. It's going to be hard though since I won't get to see Nate for like ever. I'll miss him so much, but this is a great opportunity for me isn't it? I know that our love is strong enough to help us get through that.

Nate has to present his graduation project tomorrow, I know he's going to do amazing so I don't have to worry about it. Greg and I met tonight and started working on the new website, which I must say is kickass. I can't believe this whole dream is starting to become a reality. I seriously love my life right. My perfect boyfriend, wonderful job, and amazing friends, could it get any better? Well it can but I want to be postitive here. I've had a lot of time to think lately, especially last night and I'm starting to realize a lot of things..."

"event","I have 2 more Mondays left of High School. Greg and I went and hung out with Jim Curran, it was crazy to see him again, it's been a really long time. Than, Greggers and I than had a nice meeting together, I am so happy he is back again. We are looking at doing a show a week this summer, building up a huge network of bands. I'm so excited, life is so good right now. I have the most amazing boyfriend, I have an awesome <A TITLE=""Click for more information about job"" STYLE=""text-decoration: none; border-bottom: medium solid green;"" HREF=""http://search.targetwords.com/u.search?x=5977|1||||job|AA1VDw"">job</A>, and great friends. 
I always get side tracked writing in here. Nate said when he gets his apartment him and I can get a  bunny. I found a nest in my yard that fell, one of the eggs broke and the other 2 are fine, I'm afraid they aren't going to survive. I came to the realization that I shouldn't have given Nate my gun, he's shooting things he shouldn't be shooting. Oh man he's crazy, but I care about him sooo much anyways.

tomorrow is another day, good night.<n3"

"event","Yay, I'm so proud of myself right now, I learned how to link pictures in this thing! Whoo hoo. Thankyou Melissa for being my live journal savior. Tonight I accomplish another big thing (this weekend was full of accomplishments). Rob, from A Light at the End, and I talked for about a hour about everything that has been happening and I apoligize for being blind to what they were telling me before. Things are going a lot better. I feel so good right now, my life feels like it's actually getting in order. Goodnight."

"event","So I found out today that Nathan will be coming down for the cd release party!!<3 I'm so happy I have no idea what I would do if Nathan wasn't there by my side on saturday. Rachel is also coming, and probably Dave which is awesome. All my Indiana friends will be here to support me. So now I have to get through 3 more days till I see my Nathan. 

My presentation is due tomorrow and I just have the poster done. Not the notecards, I'll probably do that tomorrow, or I'll just wing it. Well Nathan just called me and I want to pay attention to him."

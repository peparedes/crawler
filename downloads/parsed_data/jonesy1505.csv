<P><FONT color=#66ffff size=4><EM>Yesterday started off a little hectic because I had to be up at 6am for work.. But when I was finished working at 1230.. things started to get exciting.. I lounged for part of the afternoon and then was in a complete rush to get ready.. Well we met everybody @Linds.. and their was our SWEETT limo.. Well after doing the flower and pic thing we started out to prom only to realize that Jen didnt have a ticket.. Well after my sister chased the limo down we sloved that little problem.. Well we got to the place and did pictures and all that stuff.. Im going to skip talking about the dinner and stuff and go straight to the good part, the dance.. Well in the builiding the floor is like a tramp..It has 6inches of leeway to go up and down and it was insane... We danced like the whole night it was complete craziness.. haha except ""going to the restroom"" about 20 times to&nbsp; ditch certain people.. But it was insane.. Omga we didnt even know the names of some of the people we danced with.. If they looked like they were hvaing fun, we joined them..I cant believe it was senior prom.. Well after the dance I went home and took a shower because I felt completely gross and then we got all cute and went out.. Around 4ish we somehow made our way to Jen's house where we crashed... BIG TIME.. Well ya, so overall last night was definitely the best dance I have ever been too.. Cant believe its over already.. Now all thats left to look forward to is graduation... heck ya!! Well I will have pictures posted by tuesday.. atleast Ill try my hardest.. Well I have to work today so Im going to go and take a shower... Call me lovies....</EM></FONT></P>

Boy was I young then...&nbsp; Thier is no way you can be with someone who doesnt have the same way of looking at the relationship.. its just not going to work.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Funny, he told me a while ago that if I loved him, other people shouldnt phase me.&nbsp; Yeah they dont. But where does this hold up for him at?&nbsp; Why am I not allowing myself to move away from him.. why cant I get over that hurdle of needing him.. haha someones profile says that something about their is a reason why the people of your past didnt make into your future...I guess Im another damn statistic.. But I cannot allow myself to be hurt.. nor to be in a situation where I am not comfortable nor happy.&nbsp; Its not fair to me, its not fair to him... and since neither one of us can change, we are apparently just throwing the whole damn thing down the drain....</P>
<P>&nbsp;He said goodbye once.. and somehow I knew he'd be back.. He said goodbye again... and this time I wasnt so&nbsp; sure so I begged him to come back.. Well for a third time he's said goodbye.. and thats it.&nbsp; I cant allow myself to be&nbsp;begging&nbsp;&nbsp;him back.&nbsp;I cannot stop my life for something I have no control over... I was so prod of myself last night when he said that... I didnt even try to&nbsp;fight it.. I took the words that he has said to me a gizillion times..""whatever"". All I can do is find happiness for myself..&nbsp;If he loved me..he will soon realize it..&nbsp; When you love a person so much and they are not in your life.. you definently notice that void and you definitely do everything you can to get back to them. I guess this is really going to test my faith in him and my faith in myself?</P>
<P>Well Im off to do some taebo before school... Thank goodness today is swamped... Its time to pick of whats left of the pieces of me and pull myself together...

That was the main reason I went for this relationship, even knowing it would be hard. He came in and tore down the walls around my heart. In turn, I gave him my heart trusting him not to break it.. Ya, I cant get that back now.. I dont even think I want it back. I dunno.. Its funny to me how we had a conversation awhile ago. and he said ""Hanna, if those guys tempt you now, whats going to happen when your with me? They shouldnt even matter to you."" Hes right. They dont matter to me, what matters to me is him, and obviously I cant have him... WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? I dunno anymore. Ive tried what my friends have said, Ive tried what my mom has said, Ive even tried what my 14 year old sister has said. Im at a loss.. But I refuse to continue to hurt.. I cant live my life unhappy... Funny thing is, the only thing that will make me happy, I cant have.&nbsp; 127 days till I move.. 127..

Thanks to boys of the past, Ive been cursed with the jealous gene.. You already know this but Im telling you again, Because of that, you suffer. Im sorry but I dont share things... especially my guy.. (Its kinda like in Kindegarten when I wouldnt share my favorite bunny even with my best friend... nuuh the things I loveI tend to keep for myself) My feelings will NEVER change for you and I love you more then life itself, but I cant handle this anymore.. The ball is in your court.. So now your going to have to choose. I love you, Im here for you, and I support whatever decision you decide.... (Oh Ya..

Well today was the memorial service for Ben. It was very sad/happy. It was sad because he is gone, and thier is a space where he used to be. In turn, it is happy because we know that Ben is in Heaven and that he is playing hockey up thier and having the time of his life. I am thankful for the people of my gradtuating class.

This is not being proved to me.&nbsp; Ben Feazel is currently lying in a hospital with one of two options.. He is either A) going to die from being thrown off his motorcycle because some lady cannot read intersection signs. or B)By God's wonderful grace Ben will somehow pull through and remain in a vegatative state the rest of his life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell me how this can be good?&nbsp; Its amazing that two seconds can make or break something so valuable as a human life.&nbsp; How fair is it that Ben wont get to leave for the marines on June 12th, or go to his senior prom, or graduate with all of his friends..</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are still holding on to that one glimmer of hope that a miracle will occur in his life.. Say a prayer for the Feazel family and say a prayer for Ben.. If anything pray that he isnt in any pain..</P>

There's songs and poems and promises and dreams that might be true.
But I wont talk of stary skies or moonlight on the ground,
I'll come right out and tell you, I'd just love to lay you down.

Lay ya down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear.
Lay ya down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear.
I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around.
Oh darlin', how I'd love to lay you down.

There's so many ways your sweet love made this house into a home.
You've got a way of doin' little things that turn me on.
Like standin' in the kitchen in your faded cotton gown,
With your hair all up in curlers, I'd still love to lay ya down.

Lay ya down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear.
Lay ya down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear.
I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around.
Oh darlin', how I'd love to lay you down.

When a whole lot of Decembers are showin' in your face.
Your auburn hair has faded and silver takes it's place.
You'll be just as lovely and I'll still be around.
And if I can, I know that I'd still love to lay you down.

Lay ya down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear.
Lay ya down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear.
I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around.
Oh darlin', how I'd love to lay you down.

Me and Caiti and our two ""friends"" (which we were ""allowed"" to bring), all went out with the family.. Well it was definitely an eventful meal.... Well we all split up and left to go seperate places, and Caiti, Kyle, DH, and Me all went to Laurens apartment for a little get together.&nbsp; Well as soon as I arrived (surviving getting lost in the ghetto for an hour) I immeaditly downed like 9 jello shots.. (Caiti and Lauren made them green for St.Patty's day...way cute) Well then we started playing flip cup... haha I am a pro at downing beers, My team one like&nbsp; 9 out of 10 times.. It was crazy... Well we were all out on the balcony just chillin and their was like a huge fight right outside.. so we were like pouring beer on them and stuff... Haha well we went inside and when Caiti, Lauren, and me all are tipsy... we like to dance.. So we were all dancing and stuff, and Lauren wanted me to show them my stripper dance I saw on Oprah.. haha so I was like dancing for Lauren and it was quite crazy ( no it wasnt anything whorish or sexual, it was the stripper moves people do as a cardio workout)... (I kept all my clothes on, silly...) Well then DH was tired of being the only sober one and Brett and Doug kept trying to tease him into drinking, but I told him that he had to take home precious cargo (ME) so he best not be taking a sip of anything.&nbsp; Well I finally was able to make it down the four stories and into the parking lot and I wanted to ride home in the truck bed, but DH thought that going down 75 at 90mph with a drunk girl in the bed was not the smartest move... So I just stuck my head out the window of the truck and blared Homewrecker by Gretchen Wilson...(its my new favorite song) Well yes.. so its 1030 and Im icky feeling but have to go to a wedding shower.. So Ill holla at you alls later... much love xoxo

He immed me last night and told me that he had passed out earlier that day and they had to call 911 to come and wake him up. Well after tests today they concluded that he has an irregular heartbeat and so now they are not sure what to do.&nbsp; This was quite scary to me, considering the normal Matt was not acting... When he said ""Hanna, I wish I was joking"" when he told me all that, well that really scared me..</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ffffff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met mom after school and she rode with me over to Paragon to get my hair done.&nbsp; Char told me that this is the longest she has seen my hair and that she really likes it dark. So she opted to dye my hair a darker brown and it has somewhat of a reddish tint, but that will fade quickly.. Its wuite adorable with all the layers and flips out on the bottom...&nbsp; yall are going to have to see it.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ffffff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I got home from Paragon I was kinda bummed because my mom and sister trashed my car this weekend.. It went from being immaculate white with a spotless inside, to muddy and filled with empty water bottles. Mom gave me money and told me to clean my car so I did. Well as I was going to&nbsp;pay, someone else had already done that for me, Ty. Yes, it was really random to see him today.... and I think that was the only word for it, random.&nbsp; Well I couldnt undo the carwash since it already started, so I thanked him for paying to clean it..&nbsp; Well yes, that has put me in a weird mood... Yes well its like 815 and nothing exciting happens till atleast 10 so I think I am going to go do some Anatomy hw... Holla at me tonight.. xoxo ~Hanna</FONT></EM></P>"

So after planning a really hot outfit and getting my hair to look just soo.. I covered it all up with a hoodie and berks... Well we went to Kyle's house because he was ""sick"" and didnt want to go out so Amanda told us that we could go over thier.. Well we watched the OU game and jsut played a bunch of cards and stuff..

Well we went to thier favorite little Mexican spot and we had so much fun. For the first time, dad was able to hear all the stories about which boyfriends cheated on us and all the gossip that dad's never get the pleasure of hearing. He didnt want to hear a lot of it so we stopped. After dinner, I came home and hung out with Caiti and Kyle for a while. Dad and me were supposed to go to the movies but he was tired and I had some offers, so we skipped out on that. Well I went to a late movie with a friend to see ""Hostage"". My lord that was way creepy,twisted, and kind of scary.&nbsp;We got out of the movie at like midnight, it was snowing and FREEZING and by the time trucks get warm we were already home. Well I cam in around 1215 and went up to bed.. Got to bed around 115ish... So now its Saturday morning.. and Im up and cleaning my room, cleaning out my closets, and all that oh so fun stuff.. Well today I wanted to go up to OSU to see Mitch compete but I think everyone is working and I dont really want to drive up their all by myself.&nbsp; SO my lover Jen doesnt have to work tonight for the first time in her life, so we are going to go out together.. My guess is that we will end up at a ""party"" in middletown somewhere.. but dont quote me on that.. So ya, I think I am going to go finish my room and hop into the shower... much love to all... xxoo</FONT><BR>"

Well someone always told me that when your feeling depressed bring out the sexy side that every woman possesses. SO I have just returned from a candlelit bath, filled with Victoria Secret bubbles and Delilah music. I brought out that sexy side and I can say it is already helping me feel so much better.</STRONG></EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4><EM><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This afternoon I looked at as the death of a dream.&nbsp; I thought of it as loosing the love of my life.. All the inside jokes dealing with songs like Kokomo and movies like Sandlot and Remember the Titans and arguments over whether FSU is better then WVU (thier not!!) I thought that I would never be able to turn the Bachelor pad into a chic house or ride on the back of the streetbike.&nbsp; I looked at today as then end. The end of everything I have been praying for and wishing for since I dont know when.&nbsp; I wanted to run to him. I wanted him to make everything better like usual, I wanted him to tell me that I was a dork and that he loved me more.. but I cant. Ive realized that I cant look at it like this.. I cant lie around in his shirt which lingers with his scent and cry, forever.. Ya sure I can do that for a couple of days but what good is that going to do?</STRONG></EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4><EM><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why should I mourn about it all when I can be on my knees thanking god for putting him in my life for the past 6 months.. Why cant I be happy for every night that he tucked me in bed and so many mornings when he woke me up?&nbsp; Why cant I be thankful for the magical weekend we shared? Im not saying that Im not happy about all of this but I tend to be sad about it all. Who knows what is going to happen? Neither he nor I know what we are going to do tommorrow night much less in a couple months... I cant finish the story if I do not know what is going to happen..</STRONG></EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4><EM><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pretty sure that this isnt the end of us. Will Smith told Oprah that everyday him and Jada reevaluate thier relationship because its always changing. If someone has the same relationship to a person they are eventually going to end. Couples need to be asking each other what they can do to help the other, what changes need to be made. (Well if I am going to listen to anybodys advie, its going to be Will Smith, he knows what is going to happen)</STRONG></EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4><EM><STRONG>So I am determined not to look at this ""period"" as a good thing. In four months Ill be in a whole new place a whole new life.

<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4><EM><STRONG>Im so thankful to God for all that he is given me, I am so blessed. I do realize that I need to draw close to him though.. Ive tended to put god on the back burner in life. Ever since my summer from below, I have drawn away from god. I need to get my relationship right with him before I can do anything in life. He is the one that is going to be with me through it all... He is always their. and I am so thankful for that..""Lord prepare me, to be a sanctuary, pure and holy, tried and true.. with thanksgiving, Ill be a living, Sanctuary for you..""</STRONG></EM></FONT></P>

Whether he is my boyfriend or not, hes always going to be two things to me. 1- he will always be my best friend. and 2-he will always ALWAYS be my boy...

Well I think you can guess where my story is going.&nbsp; Tonight was an interesting one, filled with a lot of emotions and a lot of pain.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#33ffff size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to St. Clair tonight for church with Jen and Molly because Molly wanted to see Andrew. Well when we got thier, I knew immediately that something didnt feel right.. Well when it was time to shake hands I felt someones' hand&nbsp;glid over&nbsp; the small of my back and then that someone sat down right next to me.. Well as I turned to my right I saw who the hand belonged too, Ty.&nbsp; Well needless to say that sermon was very uncomfortable.. Here I am, sitting next to my best friend and a guy who cheated on me and I havent talked to formally in months.. (I was very&nbsp;close to&nbsp;with Jen that was for sure.) Well after the service he said we needed to talk and quite frankly Im tired of talking.. It seems like everyone is saying ""We need to talk"" but he said he had to get somethings off his chest so I gave him that..</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#33ffff size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never realized how hard it is to look at someone who has hurt you so badly.&nbsp; As soon as I saw him, a rush of pain and hurt feelings came over me. Something I havent felt nor wanted to feel in a long time.&nbsp; He told me he was amazed how long it had been since we had been civil and it was weird for him to see me ""happy"". Apparently everyother time we had seen each other previously I had been upset or down.&nbsp; I do not think he realized the ""death of his dream"" until tonight.&nbsp;It was tough and I did shed tears, not tears of sadness so to speak but tears off frustration. I had to sit their and tell him that I did not deserve the way he treated me or the things that I had been said. I had to tell him that although we had been on and off in the past, that it was not going to happen again.. From almost a year ago when I said goodbye, I was still firm in my standings.. We are not going to be together.. It just is not going to happen.&nbsp; Yes, I used to think that I did love him and yes I cared about him tremendously but what seemed so perfect in the past, doesnt always mean that it would be perfect forever.&nbsp; He talked about being friends and I said I would think about it, but how can you expect to be friends with someone who you were with for a long period of time and expect things to be normal.. I dont think that it is possible... I decided that it would be best if the conversation just ended at that so I said my goodbye and he gave me a hug and I left..</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#33ffff size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is just so frustrating to me to have past feelings get mixed up with current feelings.. Life seemed to be going so smoothly it seemed like things were coming together but somehow as soon as I saw him, all the pain and hurt that was in my life for so many years just came back instantly.. How do you get rid of that? </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#33ffff size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WELL so now I am home. and I have vented..all that thier is to be said is that my heart is somewhere else and it is not with Ty anymore.. Looking back a year ago I would swear on my life that I would never say something like that.. But here I am saying it and actually meaning it..&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the words "" No one will ever love you like I did""&nbsp; but my response to that is "" No hopefully noonne will never love me like you did, because you showed your love to me by cheating""&nbsp; It is over. It is done.&nbsp; The storybook is closed.... forever.. and just so you know Im sure Ill live happily ever after even though it is not with him..My prince charming found me in my time of need, he took my broken heart and made it whole and he is all I could ever imagine and more...</FONT></EM></P>"

Well ya had a REAL late night last night started out with an OC party which I did not make it to the second commerical and then had a couple hours at home.. working out some issues.. and then the gang came by and kidnapped me from my bed around 11ish...., didnt come home till 1 this afternoon... And I come home to my parents being stupid about a lot of things and THEN taking my car... That really&nbsp;pisses me off, I mean ya they pay for my gas and insurance and did buy the thing, but the fact is that they both have cars and yet they still think that I dont need mine tonight.. No, Im not going to drive a ford ranger out with my friends.. Im sorry but I would rather not drive at all then drive a wussy truck... and then they get mad when I get an attitude about being stuck at my house all night without a car and suspected to take care of my little sister... Thats crap.. If your going to&nbsp;just drive to the ski resort and park it for 6 hours.. why take mine? Maybe because it actually has gas in it? I dunno but its getting on my nerves...</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ff6666 size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well then their is Caiti who calls and decides to tell mom and dad that its not fair that Im going to go away for spring break and that they are&nbsp;paying for&nbsp;a limo for prom.. Umm who cares that they didnt pay for yours.. it doesnt matter now, its over with.. I just get real frustrated when she tries to compare our lives... Umm she gets the whole beach house this year with multiple friends since me and Molly are going to Mexico, yet she is mad that mom is arranging for my friends and me to go on a road trip? Hello.... that is totally fair.. Serving people in Mexico is definitely not a vacation even though we are out of the country... UGH....

All our ""I love you""s were just not enough to survive
Something your eyes never told me
But it's only now too plain to see,
Brilliant disguise when you hold me
And I'm free

I've been thinking and here's what I've come to conclude
Sometimes the distance is more than two people can use
But how could I have known girl
It was time and not space you would need
Darling tonight I could hold you and you would know
But would you believe

There's a light in your eyes that I used to see
There's a place in your heart where I used to be
Was I wrong to assume that you were waiting for me
There's a light in your eyes
Did you leave that light burning for me

Cards and phone calls and photograph pictures of you
Constant reminder of all the things you get used to
Is there a chance in Hell or Heaven
That there's still something here to build on
Or do you just pick up the pieces after they fall
But after all

There's a light in your eyes that I used to see
And a song in the words that you spoke to me
Was I wrong to believe in your melody
There's a light in your eyes
Did you leave that light burning for me

Should I keep on waiting or does love keep on fading away
Fading away

It's been a while since I've seen you so how have you been
Did you get my letter I wrote you that I did not send
I tried to call your old number
But the voice that I heard on the phone
I recognized but she told me the number was wrong

There's a light in my eyes it's too bright to see
And a pain in my heart where you used to be
Guess I was wrong to assume that you were waiting here for me
There's a light in your eyes
<FONT size=6>Did you leave that light burning for me?</FONT></FONT></PRE>"

<P><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theres this guy right, and um we are ""somewhat"" together, or we were... Well so I call him on Saturday night and we talk for a bit and then he says that he has to run real QUICK and talk to his parents... Well so that was about um 11:20 pm.. So I call him back at 12:30 am... a whole hour and 10 minutes later.. Nothing... So I text a couple times and I get no response.. So Im like whatever and go to bed. (Keep in mind that it really SUCKS to wait for someone and then find out they arent calling) So Sunday goes by I hear nothing.. No email, no nothing, to tell me what happened the previous night... Now If I was the one that didnt call back, I would atleast give them a reason, even if it was that they fell asleep.. but I got nada.. Well I let that go and just moved on..</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>SOOOO Monday was valentines day.. ya know the day where you show your love? Well I email him and say Happy Valentines Day (still havent heard ANYTHING since Saturday night when he said he would call back)) Well I get online and see that he is away... Its about 10, an hour and a half before he goes to bed... I im him and let him know Im trying to get a hold of him... Well of course he leaves the im sound on so if he was in his room he heard that... And then I call multiple times and tex as well. I get nothing... Keep in mind his phone is only on silent when A) he is in church, or B) when he is pissed.. So about the fourth time of calling, I leave a message and go to sleep.... By this point Im getting a little worried... either 1) he has been hurt and I dont know about it. or 2) he truly hates me and is over me.... So ya this morning (tuesday) I email him to see whats up.... (checking his email multiple times a day,I get nothing) I email him a second time... still nothing.. I call him (dont ask why...) NOTHING... So finally I just got an email a little bit ago that says "" I dont have time to argue with you... stop being immature. I was sleeping!!""&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ummm how am I supposed to respond to that..

I know we all have lives and I dont expect his to revolve around me. But when I dont hear from you in three days.. It can be kinda scary for a girl.. especially when it is from a boy she loves...</FONT></EM></P>

<P><EM><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday mom and me went to visit Carson-Newman near Knoxville, TN. I absolutely fell in love with it. The campus the people everything about it I loved... I ran into Annie Gormas while I was thier which was totally weird but we had a blast. I just felt at home while I was thier and I have a real good feeling about that college.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Carson- Newman we headed to Robin's house to spend the night. Well somehow we ended up at this complete redneck bar in east Tennessee singing Karaoke.. I had a blast but the place was definitely a dive. To avoid being hit on by some redneck guy named Butch me and Darby decided to sing. haha me, sing?!? Well we got up their and sang ""Any man of mine"" by Shania Twain... I had a blast and we even got&nbsp;compliments haha.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well Saturday morning we got up at the crack of dawn and went to Tusculum for my scholarship interview. When we first arrived on campus the place looked completely deserted... It was real old and realy empty.. I did not really like what they had to offer but my interviews went extremely well.. During the second one, the prof. was somewhat hitting on me and he introduced me to all of his colleges and invited me to eat lunch with all of them.... very interesting... Well after Tusculum we went back to Robins and I was completely wiped... but Alicia came over to show me her engagement ring that she had gotten THAT day.. Her and Bobby got engaged on Saturday but are deciding to wait 4 years before they get married... I personally think that is WAY to long to be engaged.... Well that night we all just played games and chilled, it was quite fun.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night their was a superbowl party at DH's... Man it was crazy.. We had a very ecletic group thier but it was quite fun.. Well I started getting sleepy during the 2nd quarter and started to feel sick. So after the halftime show I skipped out and went home. Well mom took my temp and it was 102.. This moarning I had to go into school early to take a Calculus test and during the middle of the test I felt like I was going to get sick so I finished the test and jsut walked right out of school. So I was technically in the school for an hour but I was marked absent like I had never been their because of the fact that I didnt even go to one period.. So I just came home took some medicine and have slept seriosuly all day.. Well now Im up but Im not feeling too hott so I think Im going to go back to bed... Muah ~H</FONT></EM></P>"

He had me&nbsp;lay on the floor and have this big exercise ball between my legs and raise my body and my legs at the same time.. so ya I was laying thier trying to do these impossible situps while I have this huge&nbsp;red ball between my&nbsp;legs, well since it was like an East renuion their today everyone was&nbsp;having a blast watching me.&nbsp;BUT you have to do what u have to do and I want a 6pack so I have to do this to achieve that goal haha.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#33ff33 size=4>&nbsp;Well school was definitely interesting, we had&nbsp;and anatomy lab on reflexes so we had to lay on the tables and such while our partners hit us in different places with mallets.. Ya so of course it was Hanna's day to present in World History so I was all dressed up in heels and cute slacks and top and I had to get up on this table while Katie hit me.. Well apparently I was the only person in the class with an ankle reflex so everyone decided to come over while they experimented on me.. It was definitely a little odd.

So today I wasnt in the best of moods and Dave came up in 3rd period and was really getting on my nerves and he could tell so we somewhat got into it... Man oh man was I hott! Well then in 5th period Tim kept running his mouth on situations in my life and I was even more ticked off about that.. So ya today I went to the gym to work out and some weird ghetto guys kept trying to talk to me while I was on the treadmill... Hello?!?Im working out here, not looking for a date... Well after I was finished working out and walking out of the gym.. I see them standing in the parking lot.. Thank god I had a four oclock appt so I could get out of there... Man I guess people have been just getting to me today for some reason.... Well anyways.. Im about to go to try and relax in the tub... Muah ~H</EM></FONT>"

<P><FONT color=#33ffff size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well at lunch today David and Mitch dragged me away and said we all needed to have a little chat.. After they got me away from the group, they proceeded to bombard me with questions concerning my dating life and Drew... They think that it is their job to find me a prom date and I dont think it is... Im a big girl, I can figure out that by myself.. I wish everyone would just leave it alone and let me be. If I want to stay stag then I should be able to... Gosh we all are 18,(well almost) so we should be able to handle are personal lives by ourselves... Ya that was the theme today "" Get into and control Hanna's personal life"" Oh boy oh boy I love all of my friends... Its never a dull moment when they are around... Ya well Im still in the decision mode and I HATE it... I want it to be may, but Hey May 1st is not too far from Febuary 1st...</FONT></P>

Whose not spoiled?/ Well Im out</FONT></P><lj user=""jonesy1505"" />"

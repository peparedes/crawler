"event","OK, I now offically hate guys.  I'm so confused, why would jeremy go out with me for 2 months and then tell me he never had feelings for me.  I just don't understand it.  he talked to my parents about moving down here to be closer to me.  oh well, I guess it's not really important anymore.  I really need to focus on school again.  I've completely lost focus at school.  I think I'm gonna take a break from dating.  I just wanna have fun.  I didn't know that it's asking alot to go out and just have fun, and be with someone, without being serious.  I mean even if I'm just dating one person, I usually only see that one person.  I just thing that's fair.  but whatever.  I guess I'm just not good enough for some people."

"event","lol you may find this funny but I completely forgot that I had my live journal.  well alot of things have happened in my life since my last update. first of all I am finally rid of josh, we broke up like 3 days before my birthday.  Yes, I am guilty of talking to him still, but the other night I put that to an end too....reason being is that I have a new boyfriend, he's so nice, and while he has screwed up and not called me all last weekend, he has apologized and everything is ok now.  I can't believe that I finally met a guy that's worth having.  He gets along great with my family.  He, like myself loves kids, and even though I just found out that he has a 3 year old son, it doesn't change my feelings for him a bit.  No, I'm not saying I'm all in love, because I really don't know about that. I care about him tremedously but I'm still now sure it's love and I don't wanna say it until I'm absolutly know for sure. I mean yeah I've thought that I've been in love before but how do you really know when your in love?  all I know is right now I'm happy with who I am, and I'm happy with all of my accomplishments.....(even though I'm sick of it) I am very happy that I got a promotion.  I'm now assistant customer service and sales manager/bookeeper.  well I know it's not that long, even though I haven't written in like 3 months, but that's pretty much all I have to say.  I hope everyone has a great day......and Be happy even if your in a bad situation because, even though it may seem bad now, you will most likely learn from it and be able to move on and become stronger.....I dunno why I felt the urge to say that but whatever...lol talk to you all later, and I will try to update more often........just for you linz"

"event",":( :( I'm so depressed, I know everyone hates josh, and I know it sounds silly, but last week I felt closer to him then I ever have.  everyone is so quick to judge him.  I know he's done some mean things, but I've been mean too, the truth is, I truely feel for him, and care about him.  I had so much fun last sunday when I just went to his house and we talked and went for a walk.  I'm so afraid I'm not gonna be able to be held by him again, I know he needs to figure out stuff in his life, but he hasn't talked to me since he told me he thinks we should just be friends for now.  I miss him more then anyone knows.  if only I could get him to see how much I love and care about him. this sux so bad cause I know he cares about me.  I also know that he is afraid of commitment and that's what is scaring me about him not talking to me. I'm sure it's probably me just wishing, but I really think that he's just pushing me away right now.  we talked alot last week, and we saw each other way more then we ever have in one week. lol I just want him so bad, and not for anything else other then the fact that I want him, he's such a great guy, if only everyone had time to get to know him................"

"event","ok, I had to work like all weekend.  FOODLION IS CRAZY.  today will be the 6th day that I have closed, with the exception of getting off an hour early yesterday.  anyway enough of foodlion. lol, I spent the night at lindsay's last night, and I got to talk to josh and Kenny my old guard coach for awhile.  :) that was very fun.  there has been so much that has happened this weekend I don't know where to start.  lol I got paid to watch fireworks on the 4th yay :).  I'm so sleepy, the reason I was hangin out with lindsay and derrick last night was cause josh had posted something about going on a date with a girl in his blog on PAINTBALL2EXTREMES website. I was so upset, cause I had asked him abuot it earlier and he came back with what the hell are u talking about, so then I when we got to lindsay's house we cut and pasted it to his im and he was like oh, I was just saying that in general, and I just let it go, but he did sound like he had a guilty concious. lol jk so anyway I was really happy cause I got to talk to him for a long time, then when the stupid cable modem went out he was to busy after that to talk to me.  so then I started to talk to kenny, which was fun. :) well I'm gonna go get ready for work now I'll talk to yall all later..............heyyy yaallllll.   lol or ffffffffffuuuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkkkkkkeeeeeerrrrrrr.  from last night lol, stupid drivers"

"event","oh my god, do u ever just wanna call someone a shithead?  I totally wanna call josh a shithead right now.  if he was with me I probably would. lol  I understand that he has to work but brittany was honestly just joking around, ok I guess I should tell the story before I go on..... brittany, derrick, and I were going out to lunch and I had to stop and get gas, so brittany was looking at my phone, she decided to call josh my bf and leave a message on his phone which was really funny cause they have never met before.  I knew he'd probably think that it was funny but I din't think he'd get mad about it.  anyway, we went out to lunch and derrick and I told brittany about the time that lindsay imed josh and was like ""I hope u don't think this is to forward but I just wanted to say hi I'm krystal's friend."" and he was like ""yeah it is""  so we were all laughing about that and brittany was like I wanna call him again and I was fine but I doubt he will pick up, so she calls him and she's like can I leave another message and I was like I dunno I don't think it's a good idea but she did it anyway.  so then he calls back about 10 minutes later and starts....well not really yelling....but his voice was different.  so he is like repramanding me about how I shouldn't let my friends use my phone and how I should control them, ........SHIT HEAD"

"event","it's funny the shit u find when u move.  i found a folded up piece of paper that vickey drew a map to her job on.  I unfolded it and it was the last 6 lines to Evanescence - Call me when ur sober.  i thought it was ironic.

""So don't cry to me.
If you loved me,
You would be here with me.
Don't lie to me,
Just get your things.
I've made up your mind.""

yes, it's still a crazy a time in my life.  this is the first night i'm spending back at anna's.  it's strange.  and sean is being a stupid bitch anyway.  that douchebag wanted me to drive him to work today.  we can't even txt msg without fighting and he expects me to drive him to work?  you have seriously got to be kidding me.  

i guess when u don't have the rose colored glasses of love on u get to see people for what they really are.  it's kind of sad actually.  not that i'll miss him that much, but he's changed into something completely different right before my eyes.  i wish him the best, kind of...there's still that bitter part of me.  but that's enough about him.  the sean chapter in my life is officially over.  time for the next one."

1. Sean must think I'm fucking retarded.
2. I won't need as many boxes as I thought.
3. I have a lot of clothes.
4. I should go to sleep soon.
5. I think it's funny that Sean is on the bus right now.
<hr>
Music is my life.  I have this gift to know which songs are just perfect for each moment in my life.  Here's one.

Britney Spears (of course)
-Lonely

To think I'm so naive
How dare you play with me
I gave you heart and soul, yeah
Tell me baby please
Oh why you screwin with my head
I don't think you understand
I won't take your, uhh, no more
Don't knock on my door

Not this time because I recognized
I've heard it all before, and I, I, I...

[chorus:]
I think of all the time that I've wasted
I think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Let's just face it (Face it)
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in

Don't tell me how to feel
Or say that you're for real
My minds made up I'm cool without ya
You got no more appeal
Now this girl don't need no man
Say what you can do what she can't
Now I live for me
Boy does that make you weak

Not this time because I realize
I've heard it all before, and I, I, I...

[chorus:]
I think of all the time that I've wasted
I think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Let's just face it (Face it)
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in

Think of times you made me cry you,
Had me so confused
I'm tired of trying to leave behind this
What's a girl to do

Think of all the times you made me sick
I used to think I couldn't handle it
What you think, I'm just another chick
Mess with Brit, boy you must have tripped

What were you thinkin' when you lost my trust
You had it all and now your left with nothing
Ooh baby now I know you want my touch
And now you're lonely and you still want me

[chorus:] [2x]
I think of all the time that I've wasted
I think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Let's just face it (Face it)
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in"

"event","So I'm counting down the days.  It's a weird thought, knowing that while I'm sitting here in what I've called home for the last 2 years it'll all be gone soon.  The memories, good and bad will be distant (Cuz I've got the memory of a goldfish).  There won't be anything to remind me of the time I've spent here.

It's like the end of the year for me.  It's given me this chance to reflect a lot about my life so far.  I'm not going to say that it COMPLETELY sucked, but...At work we don't call them errors or mistakes, they're educational opportunities.  I've had a lot of opportunities.

So now...here's where I'm at.

1. I know what I've done.
2. I know what I would've done differently.
3. I know that I can't change the past.
4. I know that I have no idea what I'm doing right now.
5. I know where I want to be.
6. I know that no one else can fix this for me.  I have to do this myself.
7. I know that it doesn't mean I can't lean on people for support.
8. I know that it sounds like I'm trying to kick a drug habit.  But I'm not."

"event","So after all the messy gay boi drama I've decided to retire for a little bit.  When I move back to Anna's my life will be completely different.  I'm going to avoid clubs/bars as much as I can.  I'm going to return to my roots kind of.  I've realized that while fun, I'm not exactly a club-going guy.  It's just not me.  Me is walking the strip, playing pool, videogames, comics, books.  I'm going to definitely take advantage of her pretty much private back yard and work on my tan.  I'm going to use all the not going to clubs time to get back in shape.  

I'm going to work on my issues with myself, self-esteem, self-worth, confidence, insecurities.  It's not going to happen over night.  It's going to take time, but I think that I need to do this.  I need to fix myself and be a better person before I can fully explore what LIFE has to offer me.  I need to love myself before I can be in a healthy relationship with anybody.  My life has changed so much in the last 2 years that I don't know who I am anymore.  

There's been so many ups and downs that I don't know if I'm better now than before or worse.  Most people would say better, but then why do I still feel like total shit? 

Maybe I'm looking at things the wrong way, or maybe it's my negativity coming out, but I don't like my life right now.  My thoughts sometimes don't make sense.  Sometimes I think that I have no friends.  NOT TRUE!  Sometimes I think the ones I do have don't like me anymore because I'm broke.  NOT TRUE!  Sometimes it makes me sad that my phone never rings and I know it's because everybody I know is on a different work schedule/phones have been shut off.  But it hurts sometimes when I think if I didn't call them that they would never think to call me.  It sucks because I know it's not true, but then I don't know why I'm always the one asking them to hang out with me and they don't do the same?  I hate my thoughts sometimes.  It's all not true.

I hear more from Sean's family than my own.  They actually ask me how I've been, if I'm okay, and what I plan to do.  I've lost touch with my own family.  They don't know me.  They don't know how to talk to me.  They don't know that I'm gay.  They don't know anything and I only have myself to blame.

It sounds like I'm depressed, but I'm not.  It's just the way it is.  I'm not sure what's going to happen, but I know how I want everything to go."

"event","there are so many mixed emotions right now.  anger at the way sean has changed.  maybe not changed but always has been.  confusion because how do u deal with a lying-let's-stay-friends-ex who u were totally in love with who kept saying maybe we can get back together.  things have changed so much lately.  i mean like my life did a complete 180.  then a couple more until i wasnt the same, but everything else had stayed the way it was before.  i havent known sean as friend.  and i dont know how to not be his boyfriend.  and now i dont want to know sean as a friend. but thats not entirely true.  i care, but maybe i really just need to take a step back and look at everything away from the situation.  make it not weird.  i like him, i think genuinely deep down he's not a bad person.  he's just making mistakes and needs to figure out how to get through it.  on his own.  and maybe that'll mature him a little.  i dunno.  hope for the best, expect the worst."

"event","So I never really update.  It's just something that happens.  But I don't know, I actually feel like I have something to say.  There are just soo many things that swirl around in this brain of mine and it's hard keeping track of it.  I think that's part of the reason for my horrible memory.

  I've seriously hit that quarter-life crisis that everybody talks about.  I just feel so empty and hollow right now.  I've gotten to that point where I'm not interested in anything that used to make me happy.  I've been looking for things to keep me occupied, but I can't find anything.  I've lost contact with myself.  

  I'm seriously one of those people that you can't tell on the outside what is going on.  I let people see what I want them to.  I think that's part of my problem.  I've spent so many days at work being bored and analyzing myself, trying to figure out what's wrong because I don't have too many friends, I've been single forever and whatever I'm doing is not working.

  I'm pretty sure that ""quarter-life"" crisis is just another word for depression.  Sounds the same to me.  Either way, I'm working on it 24/7."

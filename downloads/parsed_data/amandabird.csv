"event","Last night, in a dream, a woman mixed me a drink she called a Calvin and Hobbes.  It was rum and Coke, she told me, but with a float of Cointreau.  The drink made me happy in the dream, so when I went over to Dad's this afternoon I decided to try replicating it.  It was good---somewhat sweet and pleasantly orangey---and I imagine it would be just charming garnished with a tiger tail of orange peel.

You wanna make one?  Of course you do:

Step 1: Get ye highball glass.  Fill halfway with ice.

Step 2: Get ye rum.  Light, dark...Mysterious Anima Figure did not specify, so it's up to you. (For the record, I used Bacardi Gold, as it's what was on hand.)

Step 3: Measure one shot of rum and pour over ice.  Or more.  I won't judge you.

Step 4: Fill glass the rest of the way with Coke.   Mmm, fizzy.

Step 5: Float some Cointreau on top, or, failing that (it *is* pricey), whatever you've got that's orangey.  For example, Dad had no Cointreau, but did have some Sublime orange liqueur and some Blue Curacao.  After much deliberation, sans internet access for researching---God, but I'm useless without teh Google---I decided on the former, then bitched out and put a splash of the latter, because I'm indecisive.

Step 6: Drink up, and forget your problems at home.

"event","I went to the movies yesterday and saw Van Helsing... boy, that was crappy. I am growing sick of these super-productions with great special effects, breathtaking action sequences, beautiful heroines yadda-yadda-yadda. That's awful, people... we all know they can do wonderful things with computer tricks... so this isn't what filmmaking is supposed to be about, eh? I don't understand. 
Whatever happened to movies like Stand by Me or The Breakfast Club? Those were great... nothing spectacular, only introspective, focusing on characters we can all identify ourselves with in some way, because they're human. Yes, human. Human and imperfect. 
I'm a bit tired of Hollywood stereotypes fighting werewolves in high heels and poking into snotballs that contain the offspring of hell. Seriously, that's getting lame. The time is coming when we should watch movies for the stories' sake, or the depth of the characters. 
Seriously, what's Van Helsing (a bad copy of Wolverine, if you ask me) against Andy or Allison (my heroine. She has my taste in men...)? Shallow, hollow, see-through nothingness. 
Okay... but that's just me. I hope there are more people who think like I do, especially amongst filmmakers. I'll start boycotting superproductions if this keeps going on... but what am I against the world of artificial youth and modernness? Nobody.... but at least I'm true to myself. 
Okay... I'll go shopping today. That should cheer me up."

There are no absolute truths, folks, accept it or let it be. At least that's fact. Or is it? Now I'm confused). Writing stories is how your imagination copes with history and the way you interpret it....the way you see it, the way you wanna see it, the way you want it to have been. Yes, that's why God graced us with brains. So we coulduse them! Imagination is a part of that....

<lj-cut text=""Trust or the heartbroken bird""> Trust is borne on fragile wings
On the bird that slowly dies whilst she sings
Of feelings and doom she cannot allow
To love and pain she has to bow
Suffering and torture deep
Poor sombre soul, it will not weep
Falling, fallen down that grave
It is herself she will not save </lj-cut>"

What is being a fan? 
I was just wondering why I like the things I like... oh, it probably has a really psychological reason, but I can't figure it out. It's the same reason I pick the small, blond and crazy guys to fall in love with. 
Guess I just fancy daydreaming. 
And I don't have a national identity... Man, I've spent too much time in Europe to be coming back to America!
Sometimes, it annoys me. Especially to notice that my English is sounding British!! People think it's cute. Frankly, so do I. But who am I? 
Well, that's the good thing with imagination. You can be anyone you like and go where you will. And, in your mind, you're Mary Sue forever and for always. At least I am (which is how she came into being, because everyone does that I reckon!).

"event","Aaahhh..... alice nine's new song mugen -electric eden- is JUST. TOO. BEAUTIFUL.&nbsp; <br /><br />Every time I'm done listening to it I wanna hear it over and over again, though I tell myself that I shouldn't listen to it the whole time because I might get bored XD But I think it's just too wonderful to ever getting bored with it... In fact there's hardly a song by a9 that I got bored with (except maybe some of the very old ones...). I guess that's one reason why I love them so much.<br />My thoughts are so absorbed right now...<br /><br />I also like atmosphere very much. It makes me smile. And mugen makes my heart feel so warm and safe... I think if I have many worries alice nine's music has the power to cheer me up and to make me forget about them for some time...<br /><br />There are some things I truly love in my life and would never want to give up...on the one side certain persons (of whom one is likely to read this and will know it) and on the other - alice nine and their music that gives me warmth and confidence if there's no one else around to do so. <br /><br /><br /><br />So, everyone out there. Care for the people you love and hold your beloved things...to put it with Shou's words...<em>by your side</em>.<br /><br />"

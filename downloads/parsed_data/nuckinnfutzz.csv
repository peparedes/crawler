I have started..now I can rest..I am exahusted..

sis, glad you are at peace. My friend Margot a brilliant massage practitioner went and got you a 'stone' that aligns your chakra's..It is really rare and she got it on a trip a month ago. I will send it soon, as for now i keep it safe and warm inside my pocket as of today as a reminder that everytime I put my hand in my pocket and touch that kool blue stone, I say a prayer for you.

Just add wine and beer into the mix and it's fun. My lover will be in Issaquah with momie. Bummer. Just found out he goes to his brothers in Oregon for Cmas. We had a great weekend. And no..it isnt all about sex..but damn we have fun. Joe busted us in the bubble bath when i was on top of him eating bubbles ect. Then we went out to a bar and all day Sun we had fun. Subsequently, I was kinda sick on Monday and missed work. But it was legitamite. Karma is funny though because today I lost a $200.00 14k gold chain that I have had for 10 years!!!Bummer. The good thing is that I have my $600.00 baguette ruby heart shaped pendant that I got when I turned 29..almost 10 years ago. Anyway Go Seahawks! Go Bears! Football is rockin in 2005!

Gotta go potty
Gotta go home
Gotta eat supper
Gotta have a beer
Wanna have a captain and diet
Wanna have some serious rockin sex with my lover
Want to make a memory of today that will last all week
Just gotta get a grip
I just gotta get ripped


That sounds childish
Sounds funny
Sounds boring
Sounds sweet

Goodnight

Lyrics for Song: Jesus, Take The Wheel
Lyrics for Album: Some Hearts



She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati 
On a snow white Christmas Eve 
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat 
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline 
It would been a long hard year 
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention 
She was going way to fast 
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass 
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes 
She didn't even have time to cry 
She was sooo scared 
She threw her hands up in the air 

Jesus take the wheel 
Take it from my hands 
Cause I can't do this all on my own 
I'm letting go 
So give me one more chance 
To save me from this road I'm on 
Jesus take the wheel 

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder 
And the car came to a stop 
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock 
And for the first time in a long time 
She bowed her head to pray 
She said I'm sorry for the way 
I've been living my life 
I know I've got to change 
So from now on tonight 

Jesus take the wheel 
Take it from my hands 
Cause I can't do this all my own 
I'm letting go 
So give me one more chance 
To save me from this road I'm on 

Oh, Jesus take the wheel 
Oh, I'm letting go 
So give me one more chance 
Save me from this road I'm on 
From this road I'm on 
Jesus take the wheel 
Oh, take it, take it from me 
Oh, why, oh"

"event","When the movie 'The Prince Of Tides' with Streisand & Nolte came out I saw it in the theatre because I am a HUGE Bab's fan. I cried and cried and thought it was a good movie.

I saw the movie again on Sunday and it took on a whole new meaning as I have become 10 years older and hopefully wiser.
I am wondering if I can try and have relationships with people who have hurt me and let me down. Like my mom. My sister accepts her, but I will never make exuses for her behavior then or now. I always wanted a mommie. Now I guess I have to accept the fact that I will never have a mommie, but MAYBE I could have a friend.

Just thinkin'."

"event","I went to a duck fart party on Fri. Neil's friends. It was fun. Low key as i was recovering from Thurs night sex fest and minimal drinking, none the less, tired all day..but SMILIN'! I sang with the band for 3 songs..color my world,proud mary,& it's a wonderful world. I sucked at that one, it was out of my range. Proud Mary kicked ass and Color my world was sung with my trailer trash fake teeth in for  as a bet with Neil( my boss).. I finished that mission with flying colors..even put on a show! I told Neil if he put on my wig that I would relinquish the lunches for a week and he did so eagerly! He even danced with it on.
 
Sat I took Wendy's kids to a Halloween party. Then we got ready for the 70's party. I looked so hot..really. all done up like Farrah. Vintage shoes, dress and hair like Jenny McCarthy has been sportin'.It wasnt the same witout my lover there, but I had fun. Wendy passed out on the stairs! I went home and rotted around 3am after eating a tunafish sand and lots of candy. Always a good thing after drinking. I was in sooooooo much pain the whole night I just couldnt get really drunk. It kinda sucked, but I usually make due.
 
Sun after 3pm  my lover came over and I gave him a bath from head to toe..soaped him up real good if you know what I mean..he was in Heaven..I was in Heaven and we loved on eachother.

I think my sister has her baby now. I gave her her time with him as she likes to be in her own world and it had been so long. Tell him Auntie LOVES and Adores him and I think he issoo special. Hi Doc!"

I love my sister because she is real and she is the shit.
I love my sister for introducing me to the mighty hot Gwen Stefani.
I love my sister because like me, the little things make her happy.
I love my sister because she sets an example of what real unconditional love is and can be.
I love my sister for tearing down a wall in me that only God could destroy.
I just love my sister.
I miss my sister.
I need my sister.
I want to hear her sing and love her son, She too is an angel-        A gift from the Heaven's.


I gave a reading today and the stuff came to me while recieving my massage. I was instructed to sing How Great Thou Art. A message to my massage practitioner from beyond.From her mother killed by a drunk driver Oct. 15th, 2004 just for her daughter. She wanted to speak to her sad spirit. It was beautiful and I could feel the presence of her mother in a yellow dress. Which the daughter confirmed for me. We knew it was real and she said she would treasure that forever. God is so good to His kids..But...... WE MUST TAKE TIME TO HEAR!!!"

THEY HAD A POLICE ESCORT FROM THE FLIGHT AND COULDNT EVEN REMEMBER THE GUY'S NAME. TOO FUNNY.
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL WEATHER.THE LAST DAY OF THE FESTIVAL. I WORKED SECURITY AND GOT TO CHECK PEOPLES COOLERS AND SUCH. I COULD STILL HEAR THE MUSIC SO THAT WAS KOOL. I USUALLY WORK THE ARTIST GATE, BUT NOT THIS YEAR.

"event","Sis, I think that having a psudo name to pen under is brilliant. Gotta keep some thing just for the VanOker.

Got my tix. Will be in Sat and I am staying with Kath for the first few daze in B'ville. Party awaits Monday night! Rich is pickin me up, so I will see you on Sun? I will call and keep you posted.

I spent too much moolah and f'd myself. I ahte it. I also hate being dyslexic! You know mom is too right?
Want to see Mikey.
As for the last comment about men being stupid or whatever it was, I sometimes agree. 

By the way,I am still gettin hotties. Even 21-25 year olds and they for the most part are legitamately HOT. Anywho, I am a big girl who dosen't have to beg. You are a thin girl who dosent have to beg. We are just PICKY!

Goin Karaokin to warm up my vocal cords for the 30th.
 
Don't overanalyze suff..you will make yourself mental. It is good to acknowlege these things, but dont let them grip you.

""Beautiful"" is one of my all time favorite songs. We should all feel Jesus' love like that on a regular basis. I should someday learn to take my own advice."

"event","I can not believe that a 5 or 6 year old child has a more detailed memory of the nightmare than I do. She surprised me with a photo of Tom yesterday. I was speechless well, breathless!I was mortified and upset. Not at Tom, but my sisiter because I have done such a good job of burying these memories far far beneath the surface that it shocked me. I had flashbacks. It drained me. Why am I upset with my sister? This is not her trying to hurt me. I calm down and call her. It will be the first time we have spoken in months. We have dissagreements then come back to eachother. My love for her overshadows the words I do not speak, and she knows that and I know that it is reciprocated.I do love her so and I protected her as long as I could, but I had to make a run for it. 

I am thinking of only one memory of Martha and it is at the townhouses in Bensenville. The ghetto. Where Tom and mom would fight insatibly and I would find my mom at the top of the stairs with a huge knife in her hand, crying. I would comfort her, but i could not understand why it happened over and over. I remember when Tom got pissed and threw a beer bottle or a bowl at our television and it just sat,forever, broken in our livingroom. Just like our family. Broken & Wounded.

I do not have the compassion for my mom that my sister does. She does not remember mom having her bar buddies sneak into our room (Sister sleeping right next to me in anothet twin bed)and try to fuck me, and I would have to beat them off or scream or something. Mom said the only way she could sleep with this one particular fellow was if his friend had someone to fuck. So mom brought him  home for me! A 13 year old? That is fucked up! She was a few years younger than I am now. I drink and get trashed. I would never do that to my child. My sister says that I dont undertand because I dont have any kids. But let me tell you, I can guarantee that no matter how fucked up baby sis gets, she would never do that to her kid. So I do understand. Choices. For every action there is a reaction. S did not , thank God, have to pull mom out of bars to come home Monday so us kids could go to school. If we couldnt find her in DuPage county I stayed home and waited for her to stroll in at her leasure because she could of card less. We were a liability. We held her down, so she gave up on us.(and herself). Mom had a gun blown off in the house many times. Men exposing their dicks on the diningroom table was normal. I remember Tom having a hysterical fun time throwing darts at our dog, mom, and S. When I saw that I said ENOUGH! I called her dad  and told him things were really bad and he better come and get his kids. It was very hard to 'betray' my mom like that, but I cared about the welfare of sister & brother. God knows what older brother E had to endure before I could get him and have mom relinquish all rights as his guardian and parent, and I was now his guardian beacuse I was 18 now. I took E back to the Seattle area with me and it was no picnic there eaither, but that can be for later.
The funny thing is that when I tried to commit suicide the last time in the late 80's, I was forced into therapy. Thank God, it saved the small sense of sanity I had left.During one session I told him I could never understand  why I  had such alcholholic ahole's for boyfriends and they would hit me and leave me for dead in a ditch. The therapist told me it was not my 'fault' and that it was all I knew from growing up in the household/environment that I did. Whew..was I glad to know I was okay, and not deserving of these constant beatings. I think I would rather get pillaged like that, then to deal with the emotional scarring of verbal abuse. Those scars don't heal.
Well I am done for now. Sis I hate to feel these feelings, but I figure we can do it together. We are all we ever had anyway. Just 4 lost siblings hiding in the back of the upstairs closet with weapons, hiding from the monster."

"event","I have been so darn busy! Lika bee.. I have been going nono stop. One kool thing is that I got to sing God Bless America during the 7th inning stretch  for a minor league team called the Everett Aquasox. Some Mariner's start out there. Anyway I had 50 people cheering and shouting my name. It was embarrassing, yet fun! I did a good job, so people say. That makes me so happy they all were there! 
Nex,t I got asked by the entertainment specialist to sing at the largest fair in our state, The Evergreen State Fair here in lil ole' Monroe. I will be singing the National Anthem before about 5,000 people in the grandstands, to the thousands at the fair(within ear shot).
I will be singing August 30th before Blue Oyster Cult. Go Go Godzilla! The fair could hit over a million attendees this year. Bad for traffic. Good for the economy.
Anyway, my bosses wife had surgery and I am going to visit her tonight. I made a personalized coloring book of her friends, and her husband(my boss). I feel it's never too old to color. If you are too old,then you know you have surpassed the threshold of insanity. 
Gotta fly. Take care. Remember, life is not about the amount of breaths you take, but about the moments that take your breath away. Peace out.

"event","I finally got a pic up there..Hmmmmmmmm, interesting, I figured I could be watching anyone at any given moment. Work was fast today..still here for some insane reason at 7:15PM!
I am getting tired though and will go home to get some gruel. I have a Dr. appt on Thursday! An update and refill for more antibiotics. My poor little eardrums! 

Just checkin in on this addiction to talking to myself with no one to say a damn thing back at me. I suppose that in the household we grew up in , we had to talk to ourselves a lot. Entertain ourselves, protect ourselves,drown ourselves,kill ourselves. It is assumed that I am still on this earth for a reason. 

Okay, I am gonna grab a brew and some food and plant my fat ass in my recliner and call it a day.

Peace Out.."

"event","Wow all these dreams with my sister in them...I went back to sleep this morning and in the two hrs extra I got, I managed to see beautiful rivers, waters, and hills/mountains..like Hawaii..then this little baby, my friens grown son who is 17 when he was a child paid a visit and peed in the river and I was tring not to wade in his urine.  Went to a concert, avoided a fight with a security officer at a concert who tried to shoot at us, was washing cars( not as cute as Jessica Simpson does) but it was a green sporty thing, my Uncle was doing laundry and I HAD to help. I was obligated.

Wierd!

Anyway I am sweating like a whore in church, so I am gonna go. Hope you all had a great weekend..

"event","wow..was I sick. I went to the doc and she said had I waited one more day I would've developed pnemonia(sp)!I knew I felt like dog crap. I am helping out with a garage sale. I had made 100.00 in a day when the dale is outside, but for fear of rain, because in this state you never know, it is inside and people are just mooseying around. Plus there is the Sultan Shindig the next town over which is a parade and carnival...So lot's to do.My friend eric is in town from Cali, but he is in Rainer and that is just too long of a trip for me to want to make. I am feeling better and fot that I am happy. Prednisone, Zpac, and other medicinal cocktails..it's all good. my weekend lover called me this morning at 4:18am. I was smart in turning the ringer off..He said he was going to Ellensburg( another LONG road trip),but maybe not. He loves me as much as I love him (in the fun dept.) but, I am the weekwnd mistress that his weekday girl knows about. I feel kinda cheap sometimes, but we really like to party. The abuser I was residing with also called me at 1""28am the other night. It seems they alway come back. It is because dowm deep they know i am the shit and I am sweet. I had a dream about my sister and I with elevators and make up..wierd..putting on make up and riding in elevators...Crazee shieet. Well gonna go..TTFN..I am tired and I have only just begun. Atleast the dr (whim I adore)called to heck on me...not many people like her left in the world. ( In the medicine world)I appreaciate her human-ness and remember that naughty nurse and spaceangel....not that I have any doubts. Have a killer weekend. Much Love..M"

"event","I have the life sucked out of me....I am getting a sinus infuction.
Even my poor little boobies hurt. I am coughing and crabby. I usually am not in such a mood but I can't help it!
I had a rough weekend and got together with my usual party friends Joe & Dub and we got it on like king kong..I left a condom in the spare bedroom of my friends house and she was not happy. I was parting like a fool drinking cherry bombs, so of course I was up until noon the next day ready to party more...I really just hate being irresponsible. Well, at my friend's expense..or my family's for that matter. 
Anywho, we ( my friends Wendy & James)worked it out last night and also, my treats came in fed ex from the passion party and my new favorite latex animal is a rabbit.  LOL


Sad, but me so horeny all the time..I am in my prime , and I am not going to waste it. Well time to check out. Love to Space, Drew, Nurse and Slavo..You all make my day when I recieve little tidbits in my morning e mail. Hopefully I will get a PC for home someday before long.James is suposed to be getting one for me used from his job in Seattle. By the way sissy..those are some good tunes you are listening to. Keep the faith. You are unbelievable.. xoxox

Work has been callin and now wants me to keep them updated cause we are hardcore understaffed for a multimillion dollar security company. Heh, s'what happens when ye take big contracts but whatever. not my bloody fault I got hit by a friggin car. I mean shit....I am havin jack shit for fun...nuthin to do, sittin in bed all day watchin movies over and over again. It gets old after a while and I am on a very limited supply of money. Go figure this crap would happen now of all times. Hopefully my tax return will help me make up for lost time cause come March 20th I really don't want to have to go back to Indiana. If I don't have the money I don't have the money. Hopefully I will finish healing soon then I can stop bitching about it hehe. Other than that not much is going on. I mean what more can I do when I can not walk for more than 10-20 minutes. Hell, with what I do and the hours I work I don't even have time to go out and meet anyone so I have no friends here. This kinda sucks ye know. However, I like it out here. Despite my lack of anything to do the weather is nice and I have some color to my skin now. I enjoy my job, not the getting hit by cars part, and it has been helping me retone my body. Uber amounts of physical activity do that to a person. I am beginning to look good again. Sometimes sacrifices have to be made. Eventually maybe I will have the chance to make friends. Until then I just have to go with the flow and wait things out. For now it's just gonna be work, books, movies, and video games. I think not having a car is also having something of an affect on my lack of social skills. Well that is gonna have to change here relatively soon so let's see what happens. Anyway I gotta bail, leg is killing me and I got oh so many things to do, despite my gimpyness. I will try to update again soon. Until then.............ciao."

"event","Evenin people. Today I bring some rather depressing news. Just five days ago this Weasel was hit by a car while on patrol. I figure it is what I get for complaining about not getting anything at work. So instead of a drug bust I get ran over, well not literally but I was still hit. It was an interesting experience really, getting hit for the first time. Heh, when I finally was able to muster up the words to tell dispatch about it through my radio a lot of our officers started jetting towards the apartment complex, it was kinda funny case even the lieutenant was coming. Once my sarge and another officer arrived however the others stood down and the lieutenant arrived later to get the details. Well, I ended up getting carted away in an ambulance, neck brace, straps, and all. After a couple x-rays and a urine test and what not I was finally released and allowed to go home on crutches. Luckily nothing was broken but I still got beat up pretty good. To this day I am still having a bit of trouble walking and it sucks cause it is keeping me from work. Boo to that. Well shit happens I guess and I just gotta keep movin on. Well we will see how things work out but I gotta get back to bed before my leg threatens mutiny. -grin- Catch ye later mes amis."

"event","Yo my people...whaddup? Hehehe....long time no see ne? Well...I am in Arizona now and things are alright. Nothing is ever easy but I am managing rather well given what all is going on now. I work as a security officer now for a company called Valley Protective Services, patrolling apartment complexes and shtuff. I can't carry a gun yet as I have not gotten the armed guard license nor have I taken the classes required for the license. I will do this in due time I am sure. At this moment I am working on getting my own place and acquiring a vehicle for transportation as by March 20th I intend to be out of the house, as I don't have much of a choice. Tis a long story and not one I can relate just yet. The job I work is dangerous though that danger has yet to find me but that is how it is sometimes. Some days ye get some others ye don't. My time will come when I get to do a drug bust or something. Mwuahahaha fear the Weasel for he doth bear weapons. And he has the authority to cuff people. XD So very tempting...Anywayz I just thought I would let you few readers know, if I actually have any, that things are well enough and that I hope to get everything sorted out soon. If I am lucky my own  computer will be running not long after I get my own place and so shall I begin to update once again. Until next time mes amis......ciao."

"event","I feel like I am dead inside. Heart so cold, soul so shallow. It's  not surprising but I dislike the feeling. However, because of how things happen it is best. To love to live. To lose to die. Emotions are a very complicated thing and can make or  break what a person does in thier life. Some people can control thier emotions to varying degrees while others simply go with the flow and simply hope for the best. Others simply hold themselves back and refuse to even give into the idea of emotion, becoming a cold husk of lifelessness. I feel like this is what I am becoming, someone who no longer cares, someone who refuses to care, to feel the way I have, to simply give the world the finger and tell everyone to go fuck themselves. My dreams, my hopes shattered I find myself a husk of a man I once thought I was. My view of the world has become tainted, forever dirtied. What should a person do when they open up to someone and simply get a shrug of the shoulder in return. To try and talk, yet be the only one talking. Some things can't be worked out if it is only a one-sided conversation. Fate's funny like that. Well I done, call it running away, I just feel that it is in my best interests because if I dont close up like this I am at the point I may find myself sitting in my own blood, watching it seep forth from wounds I caused myself. A most unpleasent image but a reality I  have to make sure doesn't happen. Pain can drive a person insane, and I right now, am fighting the struggle of my life. Does anyone care? Some maybe, but I  have lost so much from so long ago. Why do I keep going if all I continue to do is lose more and more? I don't know but these past few days have given me anwsers I never wanted to hear. Life sucks. Go figure ne? Ah well...until next time mes amis.....Ciao."

"event","Ok kids, here's a real throat catcher. I am sorry to admit I am not perfect. I am sorry to say that wanting happiness for someone is not always a good thing. I am sorry to say, that love hurts. When you find yourself torn apart, I know full well what the first thing that goes through your head is. You simply want to end it all, to cease the pain that hurts so much. It nearly kills you, when you love someone and they in turn turn away from you. Unfortunately, I have had to learn the hard way. Here I thought I had a friend back who I cared for more than anything in this world, but instead I get  cold frontier, and a slap to the face, followed by a knife to the heart. Right now I can honestly say I would gladly die to be rid of this feeling in my chest right now, and no I do not mean that physical pain I have been racked with these past few months. Emotional pain is the most severe of all, capable of driving a person to unfathomable actions. Now I struggle with my own decisions, as I work to try and figure out why it has happened like this, why has so much gone wrong, and what is in store for me later? Nothing hurts more than for you to open yourself to someone fully, and they simply shrug thier shoulders at you and try to convince  you it is all a game. Nothing hurts more than losing a friend who you have known for years and trust more than anyone else. Nothing hurts more than to want so much to work things out so you wouldnt have to feel this pain, and instead find this person standing staunchly in thier world of ice, looking down upon you with disdain, this person who you once knew cared about you just as much as you did her. Now here I am wondering what I am going to do, scared, and hurting more than I ever have in life. Can you understand? I am not sure, some people are too narrow-minded and shallow to even lift a brow to your words, others simply try to tell you that you need to get over it and just move on. Everyone has thier own ways of dealing with things. Here I am finding myself ignored, lost, and cut so deep the wound will never heal. Right now I am afraid of what I am going to do. I am dieing, forming my own shell of,'fuck the world and whoever lives in it' I continue to grow angrier and angrier, more at myself than anything, but as the adrenaline floes I am finding myself blinded with tears. What happens when your world collapses around you? When you can do nothing about it but watch it slowly fade away, and leave you standing there without a second thought. Right now I am so shaky, and scared I dare not continue to type. I need to lie down for a while and hopefully cry....I need it so bad right now. Good night mes amis....until next time...................."

"event","You know what? Here's the truth. Ok, yes, the quizzes were amusing but ye know what? Today fucking sucks. Last night ended on such a high note and all of a sudden here comes a cold ass day with rain, a complete change from the near 90 degree weather we were having. It doesn't stop there folks. After getting up my allergies kick in full force and I am sneezing every 10 seconds nearly losing my brains in the process. Now, of course that is bad enough, yet it continued to go downhill. Then as I decide to get on my computer like I usually do in the morning my mouse is acting all fubar and shit and eventually after trying to figure out what is wrong, a process which took many hours and a lenghty virus scan, which my computer was clean of mind you, I decide to switch mice and see if it was really just the mouse and LOE AND BEHOLD it is. Go fucking figure. So all this time I have been trying to struggle with a dead mouse, and am now stuck with no scroll. Dear god why. DID IT END THERE?!?!?! Fuck no. Later, when I went over to a friends as I was supposed to since a few of us were getting together and just gonna dink around for a while and work on our GURPS charas what happens? The other half of the 'party' never shows, and he was borrowing a book that we needed to do much of anything, and did he know what was going on today? Hell yeah, apparently he didn't care. So, after five hours of doing nothing but waiting, and just sitting around I come home, hoping that the one final thing I had to look forward to didnt crash and burn on me. Naturally of course that one final thing doesn't exist. Nearing 10pm and I got nothing. Finally I pop in under yahoo and well, blah man....just plain blah. Nothing is going right for me today, and it plain sucks, and these kind of days make me just want to curl up and die. Makes me feel like there isn't anyone in the world who gives a fucking shit, and that really if life is going to be like this than what is the point? -sigh- I don't know but I just hope the night ends well atleast, or just maybe tommorrow will be better....who knows...but if it continues to go downhill this Weasel is about to go off on the world. I beg your pardon for the rant but it was a much needed one. Until next time mes amis....ciao."

For those of you who have always been here I thank you and just want you to know that I really do care, even if some of you don't see me much. For those of you here in Fort Wayne, I want to say both thank you...and I am sorry. I have done a lot of things here I have come to regret but also experienced many things I have enjoyed so much. Blahness....so much to say so little time. Nor do I know how to say it. Go figure ne? o.O Hehe, ah well. NOW!!!!!! Ser of course I can't forget ye. Though we never talk we are still de bestest of friends. I have known you forever. However, yes you do have issues. ESPECIALLY PERTAINING TO CALLING ME DUCKY! -twitch- I am Weasel. End of story. -smirk- For those of you confused, tis a long story, one I shan't elaborate on. Now for the home run. o.o;; For those of you who talk to me on yahoo, AIM, or msn, or any other form of chat program. I am sorry to say that once I leave for Arizona I won't be coming back. I will continue to check my email, after establishing a new one. I will continue to update this and such. Whatever numbers I do acquire, from those people who wish to keep in touch, I will work on getting a cell phone and so.....yeah. Other than that I will never be seen in a chat program again. Games like Starcraft or Diablo 2 and what not and thier lil channels ye are in when ye log on don't count, not that I talk in them much anyway. Sad to say it mes amis, but there are a lot of reasons why I am making this kind of decision. It is best if I do leave, for more than just myself. Anywayz....I am tired and I got a long day ahead of me tommorrow. Catch ye later. Ciao. ^_^"

Here it is, the end of summer, and school is starting for all the youngins. Honestly? This summer sucked arse, but did have it's  high points. I am a swimmer at heart, and swimming is one the things I really enjoy doing. Did I get to go swimming this year? Nooooooo. >.< Argh that sucks. Now as for today it was bloody hotter than hell, it's going on 9pm here as far as our clocks say and I am still like....suffocating. It sucks, and now I am so friggin tired it ain't funny. Today was kinda odd. Not sure how to say it but someone apologized to me which completely threw me off balance. Felt like getting jolted with 12,000 volts of electricity...really...that's how shocking it was. XD Hehe. On a nother note our youth pastor said he wants me to testify this Friday at the alternative, our lil youth get together. o.o;;; I'm scrooged. Scrooged...heh that's funny. I'm a funny guy. Funny looking. :p Oh yeah!! You were wrong!!!(you know who you are) He doesn't want me to sing in the praise team....just to testify. O.o Anywayz, it sucks not really having anyone here anymore to talk to, Jared went back to Providence yesterday but he will be coming back in January. Craig who I will be getting a place with won't be here till the end of September basically. This sucks. I have noone I can just chill with or anything now. Bugger. I get bored sitting here everyday. I mean the only times I get out is when I go to church for whatever reason, or am job hunting. With the exception of the past few days however cause I went and saw AvP and Spidey 2. Awesome movies. Must buy. Now I am sitting her with allergies that are driving me ballistic, and almost out caffeine. Dear God why?!?!?! No caffeine and no sugar make Weasel go nuts nuts. -twitch- Ah well....I am off in search of munchies. Until next time mes amis. Ciao."

"event","Here today, my faithful readers, I apologize for my lack of updating in a while. So here is one to inform you of my current plans. It's been decided that I am going to stay here till late winter early spring. I am going to try and get a job in that span of time and save up some money. Some will be spent towards rent and shtuff but as soon as a friend of mine comes back we are getting a place not long after. What other bits of money I have will be put towards my convertivle which oh so direly needs love and care. The poor babe has been beaten up and it is my duty to restore her to her former glory, just so I can speed down the roads at eh....60 miles an hour. ^_~ Trust me, dangerous, but damn fun. There is a lot goin on right now, and as changes are being made, and adjustments completed, I am finally beginning to get back to a normal life. I just want to say to those of you who have struggled with me all this time, that I thank you. As for those of you who could not take me, and unfortunately the fact that I struggled with my past, making me someone I did not wish to be, I am sorry you went through that. It's nice to know atleast some people care enough to stick through it all, and even help me with what has been going on. I will admit there are still some things that get to me but that's why I am moving away. So I can be in a place where noone knows me, with that I can try to supress my past and really start a life I can enjoy. Who knows. Well, I got a lot more I could say but I am oddly enough not in the mood to write. Gomen-nasai. Until next time mes amis. Ciao."

Cause that's just plain bullshit. I think perhaps I am not the only one who needs to learn what maturity cause that's just damn funny. I mean, if this is how things are really going to keep going then maybe it's time for people too see what it means to really piss me off. I could enjoy snapping on someone for once. I am tired of this shit, and while I am trying to pull myself away from the situation all I get is a bunch of shites drawin my back in with thier childish ridicule. 'You're dumb dude?' What in the hell? I haven't heard such a pathetic line since.....before middle school. While I sit here finding myself thuroughly pissed by this I am amused all at the same. Just to really make things fun I got more news. I have decided to stay. For a while anyway. Craig is comin back, a friend who I have known since the my freshman year in high school. Once he gets back not long after me and him are gonna get a place and enjoy life as single bachelors? XD Ok he will....I'm just gonna keep doin what I do. I need to save up anyway cause I wanna go to Arizona. I got an acting possibility out there. Major Wo0t!!!! I have always wanted to act and the position is for inexperienced actors...so we will see if I can slide in or not. Ye never know. I could be the next Johnny Depp. XD lmfao....yeah right....anwayz...keep it up you two....I need the amusement. Here is a question for you faithful readers? Do you all want more insight as to what's going on and how humankind can really be a bunch of shit fucks? If yes then feel free to comment and say so....I got some conversations saved...so I could always give everyone a good idea of what is going on. If yer gonna make my life hell...then don't expect me to sit down on the sidelines and watch it happen. This my friends is what living in the past can do to you. Don't let it happen to you. It sucks, and situations like this arise. Not fun, but meh. Until next time....Ja ne."

This was made as commentary to my last post. I was waiting for something like this. Hehe. Let's get some things clear. This is a journal, not the world. I don't expect the world to revolve around me, it'd probably wobble anyway. This is a journal and therefore it is a compilation of my thoughts and feelings, much like diaries that women keep. Just because it is online that doesnt mean it is any diffrent. Therefore, just because I am expressing my feelings on any given matter in my life does not mean I think the world revolves around me and that nothing matters but myself. I am going to tell you all right now that if you don't like what you read don't read it. When you read this journal you do it voluntarily without any sense of obligation. This is 'my' journal. With that so shall it be about me, what I think, how I feel, and whatever else I want it to be. You don't like that? Don't read it. I refuse to make changes just to appease people who, all things considered, don't really give a shit. This is not to say I will continuously bomb people for things that they do or have done, but if certain things involve me than I will be damned before I keep it in anymore. Thank you for your time and I am sorry for the poor but necessary update. I could go on but I got a few things to do. Things are set in motion and I am about to make a big change. Let's rock the boat and see what happens. ^_~ Until next time....Ciao."

"event","My apologies once again for waiting over a day mes amis. Unfortunately, yesterday enlightened me a little on certain things that really got to me. It's sad when you try to make up for things by helping, and for one day you think perhaps things might look up again, and then suddenly it just collapses again. Nowadays I feel so alone. Hell, I sit alone in church now. I am isolated from the world, trekking across the sands of time in search of my oasis. Where I will find it I am not sure. Being treated like that is like having a bone broken. It hurts for months, even in it's cast, but in the end it will heal but it varies on how long that takes. Except in my case it's not a bone that's been broken. Ah well. If that is how things are supposed to be but so be it. I have done everything I need to now so I can begin the preperations for moving. Probably after this coming Sunday I will move back with my mother and finish getting ready. Jared and Stein are coming back for a visit this Friday and not long after they leave I hope to leave as well. That is if I am lucky enough. Here's the funny part though. Those people I most expected to want me gone do indeed wish I weren't here. Surprise surprise no? There ain't nuthin like Life kicking you while yer down. It's gonna be rough cause I intend to get rid of a lot of things, almost taking it completely down to what I need to survive. It is sad though. With this move to Arizona.....because of what's going on now, and what has happened in my past here, I don't see myself coming back. I told myself a long time ago, that when I get a chance to move out on my own, I plan to disappear from the world. Almost to go as far as to get my name changed. That is how sick and tired I am of dealing with the kind of feelings I am feeling now. Pain, anger, sorrow. They all lead to tension and stress that I don't need. My chest pains have gotten so bad that whenever they decide to slap me across the face I just want to sleep and not get up. I am just an all-around fucked up guy. I know my purpose, and I've done it here in Fort Wayne, it's time I moved on and away from that which seeks to pull me down. I am just sorry I have to do the things I have to do. We will see what all happens. Anything is possible. Until next time........Ciao."

"event","I beg your pardon fellow viewers for not updating yesterday. >.> I got kinda busy and too tired to try to. Hehe. I got a big update though. So maybe this will make up for it. For all who care to know out there I have been told I have psychoness. Or in otherwords I am a nutcase and as crazy as they come. Crazy for a girl maybe. *raises a brow* Doesn't matter anymore. Now it's my duty to make sure others don't make the same mistake I did.  Yeah....I'm crazy. I'm just too damn emotional. Ah....everythings just an excuse to some people so I am not gonna get into it. Now for some real news. I am really thinking about making that move to Az. There is a lot here that I don't want to lose, but sometimes sacrifices have to be made for the greater good. I have hurt to many people, including myself here, it's time I left. Just think....for all you hopeful readers I will be living pretty much in a desert....ye never know what will happen. ^_~ Death is always around the corner. Let's not think about that though. I am worried though about how I would get everything down there. Especially my computer. >.< Must....have............computer. *twitch* Worried about a certain something I have to do too. I just hope the mun listens to me, and thinks rationally than along the lines of he hates my guts. XD Ah well once ye fuck up too many times the whole world is out to get ye. That's how some people think anyway. Moving would probably be good, for me, and for a lot of other people. Sad to say that but deep down I feel that it is true, and a lot of people will be glad to see me go. Such optimism. Always had a hard time thinking optimisically. That could be one reason why things always go downhill. I hope that will change. Maybe if I move it will give me the time I need to make the transition from past to present. I am tired of hurting, and I am tired of hurting other people. Yeap.....I'm mental alright. Let's see.....I got psychoness.....got pretty eyes.....and a big ass(XD bet you wanted to know that huh? well I don't agree with it so meh). I'm just one big ball of wierdness. I am a Weasel. What else could I be? Human? Nooooo. I have had a lot of nicknames....only three have stuck. Morbius was my first. Everyone used to think I looked like a vampire in school and so I therefore acquired the name. A friend of mine even petitioned it. O.o Odd. The second was Angel....that one was nice, and appropriate kinda. Now I am known as Weasel, or Flint. Why Weasel? For a lot of diffrent reasons. Hyperactive nature, good senses, extreme flexibility. When I think about it I seem to always change my nature to fit the names I am given. Honestly, why can't I be myself? Fear. Fear does a lot to a person, and can destroy a person's life. It has come close to doing so with mine. 'Very' close. Anyways. I got some talkin to do with some people and some things to sort out. Wish me luck, cause I'm gonna need it. Ciao."

"event","Ye know, the song oddly fits. Right now, given what is going on around me, I am quite literally crawling in the dark. Whether I will find the anwsers I seek or not I don't know. I have been surrounded by darkness all my life, and it is my own fault that the one beam of light that I had to help me, and make me feel calm, is gone. I just hope things work out for her. She deserves it. Anyway, off that subject. I have come here to quell some of your fears in my earlier post. Yes, I plan to disappear, however, a select few will know where I can be found. I do this because it is in my best interests, and the best interests of others. I just want you few people to know that I thank you for being there for me and being able to deal with me as I struggle. Maybe one day I will no longer have to fight, and I can smile without forcing it. Mayhaps.....I will even cry again. I am worried about myself honestly, especially with everything going through my head. I question everything around me. Such as now, I mean, the people who once said they loved me and give me shelter seemingly don't even say so much as ""Good Morning"" or ""Good Night"". I feel like alienated almost, unwelcome perhaps. I guess that is one reason why I want to get that job so bad, so I can get out of here as soon as possible. I will reimburse them for everything they have done for me, it is the least I can do to show my appreciation for showing me what it meant to have a real family for a while. I've already decided that after I get my car fixed and my ticket paid that the first $1,000 that I make is going to them. A lot of money but they have done so much for me. I almost feel like that isn't enough. So much to do, so little time. Well, I gotta go get ready for church. Until next time on, 'In the Life of a Weasel' ja ne."

"event","Ha! I wish. Not really, but it's a nice thought. Time for another update I say, and today on 'In the Life of a Weasel' we talk about our plans for the future. My plane has crashed and burned so bad I highly doubt it can ever be repaired, casualties at a maximun, survival is debatable. Why? Cause I'm sto0pid. Ah well, shit happens, I'm a fuck up. One of those little twists of Fate, that looks shiny but is really harmful. I want so much to be what I appear to be, but that's a fight that is not as easy as people might think. I get lectures, rebukes, and looks of dismay, but that doesn't change a thing. People don't understand that I have had to do everything in life on my own, solve my own problems, make my own meals, the list goes on. Some of it is simple, others harsh. Is this an excuse? Depends on your POV. Ye know, many people could sit here and read this thinking, 'what the fuck is this guy on and what is his problem?', or perhaps even, 'Wow....I wouldn't wanna be in his shoes.' Everyone has thier own ideas and beliefs on various matters so when I bring up any subject it's hard to broaden it to the point everyone will understand. Hence, I guess, I find it hard to trust people. Noone understands me, and when I do try to get people to understand me, people give me shit cause I am used to doing it alone, and that is deemed immature, childish, and just plain stupid. I mean, I have people that say they love me but I bet they have thier doubts. So I have come to this conclusion. Kitty Hawk is where I am going to strive to work, whether warned against it or not, it's a job that will pay well and set me up to where I can hold a second job. Now, because of this, I very well may have to move back in with my mother till she gets her van fixed since she has my car. A part of me, given what's been going on, won't mind that, my question to myself is, 'What are you going to do if you move back?' I am not sure. I got so much going through my mind right now making decisions is kid of hard. However, I do know this. I plan to disappear, it will be a bit of time before it happens but once I can get two jobs rolling, I will be out of the house enough to where I won't have to worry about anything but surviving, and keeping my jobs. A friend of mine says he is probably coming back from Texas and we are already talking about plans oto crash together, which will increase the influx of money into the household. I have a lot of plans, needs, desires, wants, hopes, dreams. I have given up on my hopes however. I've fucked up to much to have such things anymore. Dreams, I have one left. Sadly, I realize that because of the changes I need to make it will not be possible for me to have that other half of me, that significant other that will help me through things. I guess I can deal with it, reality bites sometimes but you gotta bite the bullet and just keep going. If I can acquire two jobs ASAP I will be able to move out before December. Which means two things, if Tony does come back he will have his room open and ready for him, and two those people who I have hurt so much and brought doubt and worry into thier life will no longer have to worry, for I won't be around. Big plans, so little time. I despise who I am, and it's better I distance myself from the world, and do what it takes to survive than attempt to have the life I so dreamed about it. So much for the whole family and kids idea right? With what I see of myself I would probably be a shitty father anyway. *shrug* Can't honestly say. But, I got major problems, I bet a lot of people here wonder why I ain't in a padded cell in a straight jacket. It's high time I reevaluate my priorities. Right now they have become, get two jobs, save money, move out, get car, gradually fade away. Maybe I will end up one of those people living in a mountain home so far away from everyone else that people wonder who you are. Well, I kinda feel like that now, noone does know who I am. They see my past, and what it has made me. Patience is a virtue this world does not have. Something that is required for me, but as I like to say, 'c'est la vie.' What will happen with me and church? For you curious people out there I can't say. I am taking a walk with God right now, and he has given me a lot of things, not to mention has he taken a lot away. There is a lot more that he has given me that I haven't told anyone and it shall stay that way. Needless to say, when the time comes I will make the decision, and where it leads me I don't know, all I know is I am stranded in a desert and I need to find that oasis before too late. Heh....confused ye with this post haven't I? Trust me my fellow viewers....this is only the beginning. In time you will come to learn a lot about me, and the truths of reality. Wait till I get philosophical. ^_~ Until next time mes amis....au revoir."

"event","Today was only mildly eventful. Woke up at noon which was a change, guess I really did need sleep, and hey I am alive. Bet that shatters some people's hopes. *smirk* Sister finally called at like two. Tell her to give me a bit to shower and get ready. Hey, so I am picky about my hair leave me alone. Finally, I get done and I call to see if she has left, paranoid about whether or not she has shown up and my mom tells me she has. Spazzin out I rush outside and wait, hopin I didn't take too long and what happens? My mom calls back and tells me that ACTUALLY she hadn't left, and that she had went to  Grandpa's to get some shtuff. Blahness....total blahness. So then she left, and of course, she drives up in MY car. >.< Grrrrr. I shoulda expected it but still, it's my baby. So, I drive back to Mom's with her, naturally of course hehe. We prety much just chilled there for a bit, Krystel making dinner, but the taco shells were stale so I didn't eat. I am surprised I can live a day with only eating a thing of Pop Tarts. Survival of the fittest. Mwuahaha. I took Britt to her track practice, and picked her up. After that I decided to go home, kinda just in a blah mood, bored off my arse. I love my family, but I don't enjoy being around them. Especially with the fact they are abusing my car. Power steering fluid is just flowin like a waterfall out of it, and the brakes are pretty much dead, let ALONE the squeeling is a LOT worse. I can feel my car crying. *sigh* Gonna be more than two weeks before I can even get my car back and then I am gonna have to fix it to drive it. Bugger. Ah well. Only interesting part of today was something Krystel told me. My Aunt Bonnie wants to talk to me. Apparently the offer has been made for me to go to Arizona with them, as she has heard how things are going for me. Honestly? I am thinking about it, not totally sure but thinking about it. I think if I did leave it would make things better for a lot of people. Perhaps, all things considered, it is for the best. But, there is so much here that I don't want to lose. Then again I have already lost some of the most important things to me. I don't know. Monday I am goin out with them too see a movie, so we will talk then and it will be then that I make the decision. Life sucks sometimes ye know? I think that if I do move that it will give me the time to be alone, and complete the transition from my past to the present. I am tired of being the dark, brooding, loner who sits in the corner away from everyone, thinking more of what has happened to him in the past, and the potential danger of it all, then taking chances and jumping at the chance of being happy. Life itself is a threat. You never know when you will die. I could die today, tommorrow, or even the next day. Anything is possible. So why do I continue to act like I do? I am not quite sure. A part of me says it's because I am afraid of being hurt, another says that I am too worried about what OTHER people will think. A little too late for those changes right? Kinda lost the rope that was pullin me up as I climbed, but that's my own fault. Right now I think of myself as an abomination, someone who has the potential to be the one thing in life people strive to have, yet I am hiding behind a wall of such a darkness that it is near impenetrable, and cold, freezing everything up that comes close, keeping myself safe. Do I want that? Not anymore and so to this day I fight to take this wall down, and once I do.....what will happen I can't say. All I know is right now I got a shot at a decent job, one set up to where I will be making over $1000 a month and still be able to hold a second part time job. I have calculated it all out and if I were to acquire two jobs, with this primary one at Kitty Hawk in mind, I shall be able to move out on my own, pay for my bills, buy a brand new Eclipse with the accessories I want, be able to pay for insurance, and still have money left over. That is one thing making me lean towards staying here. Even though that I am almost sure a good chunk of people would be glad to see me leave. It's sad, to have become such a person that people want nothing to do with you. I hope I can change that, even if I do have to do it alone. Ah well, that's another subject for another time. I got a headache from Hell, and a church activity to go to tommorrow. Until next times mes amis....au revoir."

"event","Woooooo. Damn I feel like crap. Slept maybe two hours if I am lucky. Sucks arse it does. Meh, stress does that, but I am winning this fight. It's hard and everything but I have never given up in my life. It will suck for some time, and usually I hide, running away so I can deal with it alone. However, this time I shall not, despite the fact the people I wish would be there to help me through it and talk aren't there. I still find it hard to trust people, especially given the fact whenever I would open up to someone, BAM, the whole world knows. I don't want that, I want someone who will be patient, and listen, and even understand, or be atleast willing to try to. We'll see. Right now I got a lot of people jumping down my throats, and I find it disgruntling, but perhaps necessary. Such things will help me make the decisions I need to in times to come. Starting with when I go visit my sister tommorrow. Soon, I hope, I will acquire a job at Kitty Hawk. It will be rough, major physical labor, but it will help me get back in shape. The job itself is set hours early as hell in the mornin, but the pay is $10/hr starting so that's not so bad. from 12:30am to 6:30am will allow me to still be able to go to church and such, so there is an upside. Will also keep me open for a possible second part-time job. That way I can go out on my own, and stop depending on people, and be able to repay those who have done so much for me. I regret a lot of what I have said and done, and I doubt anything I can do or say now will change anything. All I can do is hope for a better future, and that things work out somehow. Maybe my dreams will come true, but I have responsibilities first. Well, despite the fact I am scared of going to sleep I figure it is best I try and hope for the best. I just need to get rid of this chest pain, it's killin me.  Until next time on 'In the Life of a Weasel'. Ciao. ^_~"

"event","So tired....I  haven't really slept yet. Why? Well that would be because I lost the one person I considered my best friend IRL. Why do you ask? Cause I'm stupid. I let my heart control my actions and not my mind. So because of certain situations words flied, and it ended with her wanting nothing to do with me? Go figure ne? She's right sadly enough. I came so close to running away from it all like I usually do. I even packed everything up. That's how pissed I got. O.o However, by morning the thought had been quashed, and I decided to see what happens at church today. If things continue to go downhill, then well, I'm packed aren't I? I hurt myself too much in hurting her. Just as she hurt me by simply throwing me away like yesterday's garbage. Life is like that sometimes, and perhaps there is a reason as to why it turned out like it did, but that doesn't change the fact I am back at square one almost. I am confused, lost, torn apart, and there is nothing I can do right now. I'm a guy, despite how I was raised, I am still sto0pid like that. Greatly disappointed in myself, I go to eat lunch. Later."

"event","Well.....it's over. Bible study was cancelled cause our teacher was sick, so Mom ordered pizza and shortly thereafter I ended up passing out. Talk about an energy drain. I felt so dead it wasn't funny, I couldn't even do anything. So I ended up shutting my computer down and just crashed. Two hours later I get up and go figure, everyone but Dad was in bed. He had some important shtuff to do so he was usin the laptop in the kitchen which kept me offline, so I watched Encino Man. Love that movie. Today is just another day overall. It started with my mom calling at 9:30 in the morning....could killed her. *twitch* Talked to my sister and she wants to get together Thursday since she is leaving for Arizona soon. So I figure why not, there is a first time for everything. It's high time I grew up and really worked on making the transition from my old life to my new one. A task easier said than done though. Dat's what friends are for though ne? Heh, I'm tired, still drained, and disturbingly complemplative on various subjects. So while I go contemplate my navel you all have a nice night. Ciao."

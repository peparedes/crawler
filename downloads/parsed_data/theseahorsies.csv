Friday

Saturday and sunday

Woke up early in the morning and went over to DAVID CHELSEA'S (famous cartoonist guy) house and pretty much drew comics for 24 hours which was just completely fucking awsome. it was soo cool hanging out with him we drew and listened to really weird music that i guess he collects and fuuuuck it was just too awsome to describe. but yeah heres pics from the last one that i wasnt at but you can see pics of where i was and who was there (David and spider moccasin were there this time as well) 
But yeah... just wow. and so i have a couple more pages to finish up and ill be done with mine and ill post it up on deviant art. its 12 pages long already and i like it SO MAYBE YOU WILL TOO its about a robot who walks around and does stuff.... yeah its good. so at 8 this morning garrett came and picked me up and i went home and slept until about 5 and then dinner and then me and jessie went and saw Garden state which was as good as anyone else will tell you it is. and now im here... so im going to go to bed ... cause im really tired


hopefully their will be hangage tommorow. i havent seen alot of people in a long time"

8 Theater Tech with Stoltenberg

I want to try to get rid of any late Arrivals or early releases they'll probably end up being independent studies in art or something. this year is going to be good for me i think.

so today i did registration and then me and jessie went shopping at the mall (i know... i know) but it wasnt to horrible and i got a KICKASS pair of all red high tops with white stitching and a little white trim. they're cool because they look very nintendo like (with the red and the white) and then i got a pair of pants that actually fit me (which is a first in a long time) and two shirts: a zelday one (with link being all badass on it and it says ""LEGEND AT WORK"" and a Megaman one with megaman and all the 8 master robots on it and it says ""I BEAT THE 8 MASTER ROBOTS"". I feel kinda bad about this one though because i havent beat the original megaman but i figure once i get new cables for my NES ill be able to. megaman kicks ass but LINK DEFINATLY RULZ. I wanna get the three other zelda shirts i dont have... i might be able to get one or two with my school clothes funds which makes me happy. and they even have a new zelda track jacket that i orgasumed all over when i saw it.... god i have a problem. but anyways after that i came home and was supposed to have the comic guys over but they didnt show up for various reasons. so then i just went out for dinner with the rents and some of their friends. then came home and now here i am

i relize some of you may think that me writing about my day is boring but i enjoy it. so shwa

"event","""The Black Cohosh personality has the task of learning to wrestle with shadow parts in the self and in others. These souls have positive gifts of powerful magnetism and charisma, with especially strong activity in their lower energy centers. Therefore, they naturally attract to themselves many challenging people and situations, which they must learn to confront. They often experience quite tangible feelings of threat or fear, which are well-warranted due to actual circumstances. Their personal life, or the lives of those around them, usually contain themes of destructive energy. The quality of the inner life is often disturbed, tending toward brooding, vengeful, or even morbid thoughts. These imbalances can be reflected in physical illnesses, especially toxic or congested disturbances in the reproductive organs or general metabolism. Black Cohosh flower essence imparts the ability to confront and actively transform negative, destructive, or threatening circumstances. In this way such souls gain enormous power, and learn to balance and harness their innate strength and physical prowess. """

"event","So yesterday was good. rents left with garrett so i have the whole house to meself and i got some work done on my comic. and then my honey and jenna and cutler visited me and we watched funny stand up. Then we went to LO for some tower and kenny was there which was cool and lots of other people. so then we went to baskin robins for ice cream and while i was getting subway the police showed up so i went back to baskin and saved cutler and we went to my bros house and he wasnt home and then we went to taco bell and everyone else was there so it was pleasant and i got a chance to eat my sandwhich. so then after that we saw ben and he said that eric was home and ive been trying to see that guy forever now but when we went over there to visit he didnt answer the door so i guess he hates me or something i dont know.
So then we treked to portland and when we got there we had some candle light dinner and shiiiit. and then we went for a walk AND O WHAT A WALK IT WAS. So we started walking down to the square and we found a fat death in this ash tray so i nabbed it and we brought to the square. where we smoked some of it but it was pretty horrible so we put it out. so there was this guy sitting in front of us for some time and then he came over and started talking to us and he was in a total meth trip. so he started going off on all sorts of stuff he couldnt really keep his mind on one track and hed catch himself going off onto different subjects but then he couldnt remember what he was talking about so it was kinda difficult to gather information from what he was saying but pretty much his story goes as such.
THE TALE OF MARK (C-NOTE) THE METH/CRACK HEAD
One day not so long ago a man named Mark got out of jail for either possession of drugs or domestic abuse with his girlfriend (we werent sure which cause he talked about both) so he was out of jail trying to keep somewhat clean but he started doing drugs again and oneday he met this guy and this guy even stole some sunglasses for mark and they became friends. so then last night mark was walking and he came upon some naked dude in the square fighting with his friend and somewhere along the line mark gave someone some shorts out of his bag. so then someone hit mark in the side of the head and he blacked out. when he regained conciousness he found his sunglasses because they were on his head and then found his phone but some bastard had stole his bag which had all his stuff in it. so mark was just hanging out because he had no where to go because he owed all of his friends drug money. and then he couldnt go to his aunts house because she had moved away while he was in jail and his uncle didnt like him. and then he couldnt go to his moms house because she moved to florida after his step dad died. so he was just kinda hangin out. he wasnt cold because the meth keeps your body warm.
Yes the moral of this story is to not to hard drugs. so after we departed from mark/c-note we went to the top of this parking garage and had a good talk. but it started get cold 9 stories above street level so we walked up burnside and and the way some drunk frat boys threw a cigarette at corys feet and then another one yelled in my ear. but i didnt mind. so then a pair of fairly wasted women cornered us at that sculpture by roccos and had us hoist them up so they could move the little testicle type thingy. and then two other drunk guys walked by talking about ""VOTING FOR JHON F KERRY"" and smoking pot. and then the older drunken woman (whos birthday it was) tried to molest cory but he escaped. but then some bastards in a car drove by and yelled obscenities and said they could smell the womens vaginas or something so they yelled back and then talked to us about how no one has maners any more. so then we left them and i really hope they didnt try to drive home.
So then we walked up to 23rd and on the way we saw mark again at a bus stop and had a little chit chat and then left him on his way. so we went to 21st and tried to get coffee but it was closed. but on the way to coffee some weird guy walked through the middle of us while yelling ""WHY IS IT THAT NO ONE TAKES WHAT THEY ARE GIVEN?"" and we just kinda kept on walking and we looked back and he was just standing there arms outstretched yelling ""ANY COMMENTS"" we had none so we kept walking. so then we went to 23rd and by the time which it was (almost 3) the place was completely empty. so we walked back home and when we got there we listened to some micromusic and then went to bed.


yes it was a swell night.... i just woke up about 30 minutes ago for the record.

im going to be working today but ill be able to hang later tonight .... just to announce."

so comic class is going good. though im finding it hard to keep up with my work. i sometimes wish i had no life. i sometimes think that maybe i would be a better artist if i had no friends and just stayed in my room and artted all day. but i love my friends too god damn much

This weekend was fun. friday was stressful. saturday was relaxed. and sunday was educational.

Kelly comes back so soon. i cant wait. SOOOOO EXCITED. its rediculous. so i guess the plan is to camp out at her house the night of the 9th and then she comes back the 10th or something like that but someone told me she gets back really late on the 10th. but it would still be fun to camp there. hehehehe. im going to do it at least. my facial hair is getting good for her. 

Ive been getting in these ""weird"" moods lately. and the more i get them the more im relizing that its not really a mood but a period of kind of altered perception of my world. jessie says it bugs her but the more i get them the more it feels like its just me. i dont really know how to describe it. im feeling like a different person lately. Im getting more excited about my future and im apreciating every day and everything more. i dont know what it is or if anyone understands but it doesnt really matter if i do or if anyone does. teenager raging hormones i suppose (hehehe jk)

Ive also been coming to the relization of how i appreciate my freedom. not the corny americanized hubub of freedom but the fact that i live my young life (especially summerwise) with just a feeling of being able to go and do whatever i want whenever i want. but then theres shit like parentalness and (well when i get one) a job that interupt that. I really want to live my life with a good level of being able to do whatever the hell i want whenever i want to do it. probably a good reason to be an artist eh? i feel bad for you 9 to 5ers.... actually who knows i might be one someday and that scares the shit out of me. 

i feel kinda excited for school to start again. i think it will be good. i know you all think im fucking retarded but hey what am i supposed to do... LIE???

Im tired i think i might go to bed

yes that is what i'll do

I woke up an 930 and couldnt go back to sleep which kinda sucks. but whateva. i need to sand some shit today

fuck Sublime is really good.

So i was reading this comic the other day that my uncle sent me and you know how when your reading something and you just all of a sudden really relate to it. well thats how this was. for lack of better things to do ill type it out but keep in mind its better in its comic form.

""This business of ""kidding yourself"" worries me. I dont't even know how much self-deception I'm involved in/ it's hard to get down to the truth about yourself. Any time i feel like I'm finally being honest with myself I wonder if theres some deeper truth I'm shying away from. It amazed me how i can know something and avoid it at the same time.
No wonder i get depressed. This nieghbourhood! Half the people around here seem like zombies. what keeps them going? It's like they're killing time, waiting for something better to come along-- some lucky break. Just how much are they kidding themselves? Maybe they've faced up to the futility of this life and given up. Who k nows, mayber they're just blind and stupid.
Look at this poor bastard-- all bent up like an old hinge. Jeez still hobbling around in that conition. isnt anyone caring for him? Whats with this lady? what is she thinking? Shes wearing that ratty wig like its a hat or something. Crazy, i guess. Well, this guy at least seems to have his act together. He's got some dignity about him-- pretty dapper really. (you kinda need the comic for that last passage)But then again who can tell... he might be just as miserable and lonely as those others appear to be. you never know from the outside.
Oh brother! what are these awful trendies doing down here? I ftheres onde thing that gets under my skin it's these kind of phonies... spending so much time and energy to be ""different""-- walking around announcing that thier facourite band is Abba or ACDC or something equally stupid just to get the jump on everyone else on the antifashion bandwagon. How can they even stand talking to eachother? I'd rather listen to some social misfit discuss his bottle-cap collection-- at least thats honest. Oh, who am i kidding? im no better than them. Jesus, im the biggest phoney of all. A couple years ago I'd probably be best buddies with that hateful couple.
Why do i dislike these types so much? Maybe its because they're happy walking around pretending....""

Palookaville by seth something

I need to start buying comics more often. they make me happy.

Devo is playing this sunday but im not sure if you can go or not. i think you need to be part of the ""run hit wonder"" marathon to see any of the bands. which sucks. but o well. Devo is swell.

OGOD i saw daredevil (the movie) last night. ugh it was horrid. why cant these people in hollywood properly adapt a comic into a movie. i mean your pretty much given a storyboard to go from. I hate you ben affleck! the only movies you were good in were directed by kevin smith (which was in the movie because he wrote one of the daredevil comics... i have not read it)
THEY COULDNT GET A REAL FUCKING RAT TO WALK DOWN THE STREET!!!! i hate

"event","So im back from the beach. it was pretty fun and relaxing

friday we got there and ate pasta and then watched the sixth sense and tank girl. When me and cutler went outside afterwards he randomly puked.... then we went to bed

Saturday it was really cloudy for no reason. we hung around the house and goofed off and then we went to find the sacred forest. after a few dead end streets we found it but in the end garrett was too scared to climb the tree of life... later we discovered this was a metaphor for life. so we rented the butterfly effect and after some dinner we watched it. then after that we went out to start a fire and garrett locked us out and i had to climb in a window (which was the secound window i climbed through that day). then we went down to the beach and revived an abandoned camp fire and made it huge and it was hot enough to melt our popcans. We lit off fireworks (a couple of them were lit while nude) and then there was some nakedness. we incinerated this poor little boys fort. the devil thought the whole thing was delightful. so at around 130 we went inside and had some stuff to eat and then went to bed.

Sunday we woke up late and had food and then went down to the beach and garrett and cutler walked out into the water but i was scared of the jellyfish. then we went back and cleaned and then we came home

so now im here. when i got back i relized i left the comic stuff i was working on at the beach which really really sucks. i can still work on some stuff though. so now im in kinda a pissy mood which is bad. i think ill call my honey.

"event","The Concert last night was amazing HERES A RECAP

The first band was called DEK and they sucked my asshole. they sucked all the shit out of it. They came out on stage and one of them looked like he was 9 years old and the other band memebers didnt look like they were much older. they were all wearing like sparkly suits and shirts and stuff. so i was all thinking ""o there going to be funk or something this will be ok"" but then they start playing the most horrible butt rock you ever heard. it wasnt even the good kind of funny butt rock. just horrible. and then when the pain stopped they threw free cds, stickers, and even dvds into the crowd. i nabbed one and havent watched it yet but it should be hilarious. Me and jordan and eric figured one of the band members just had really rich parents or something because they werent there on how well they played.

Then there was Bad Credit. Who were really good and alot better than when i saw them last year. they were really fucking hilarious too and were making fun of hoobastank the whole time (i guess because they are playing the roseland tonight) and even played a really shitty version of that ""im not a perfect person"" song. But yeah they were really good.

Then Petty Booka came on. They were two girls from japan who played self described ""ukulele punk"" even though there was nothing punk about it. It was just ukelele music but it was good. there was a couple pretty big mosh pits during a couple of they're songs which was definatly pretty hilarious. There were a couple drunk guys in the crowd yelling kinda rude stuff during there show though which kinda sucked. but yeah they rocked.

Then i guess Kaelin got sick and Garrett and her left which i didnt know.

But yeah then the Aquabats came on playing super rad and it was so intense. after that song i had to go to the back for a couple minutes because i was just get smooshed and while i was back there i noticed that pretty much the whole floor of the roseland was the pit. seriously like 95% of the people there were either moshing or skanking or jumpin around. probably the most crowd energy ive ever seen at a show. So they played and they played stuff off the new album and older songs like cat with two heads and martian girl and lovers of loving love and some others. And the monster came on it was this like silver mad scientist called the sprinkler and he brought out his cat beast (which was just a guy in this scary cat mask wearing a catshirt (like something an old homeless lady would wear) and he was snapping a towel) so the commander totally kicked his ass and they fled the stage. and they played more and there were some rad moments and some touching moments (the dorks of today may not be the hoobastankers of tommorow but someday we WILL RULE THE WORLD) so then they played the goodbye song BUT AFTER THEY LEFT.... THEY CAME BACK for a kickass encore of poolparty. ooooooooooooo it was sooo good.

So after the show me jordan and eric went around back and met the band which was cool. i got a squisy and the captain signed it andn then i got my ticket stub signed by most of the band (mike ill mail this too you with your cd case) and then i got a water bottle signed by the water guy... his name was quincy.

then i went home and slept."

so now im going to fold some towels and then work on some graphic novel stuff and maybe some people will come by and then im going to go to my class at 630 and then i will get home at 930 and probably stay up until around 1030 and then i will try to go to sleep and if i do then my day will be done but if i cant i'll probably wake up and do something

I dont understand why My Chemical Romance has a song about vampires

this confuses me to a level you will all never understand

Vampires will never hurt you
And if they get me and the sun goes down into the ground
And if they get me take this spike to my heart and
And if they get me and the sun goes down
And if they get me take this spike and
You put the spike in my heart

And if the sun comes up will it tear the skin right off our bones
And then as razor sharp white teeth rip out our necks I saw you there
Someone get me to the doctor, someone get me to a church
Where they can pump this venom gaping hole
And you must keep your soul like a secret in your throat
And if they come and get me
And if, You put the spike in my heart

And if they get me and the sun goes down
And if they get me take this spike and

Chorus:
Can you take this spike?
Will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless
Night time sky
Can you take this spike?
Will it wash away this jet black feeling?

And now the nightclub set the stage for this they come in pairs she said
We'll shoot back holy water like cheap whiskey they're always there
Someone get me to the doctor, and someone call the nurse
And someone buy me roses, and someone burned the church
We're hanging out with corpses, we're driving in this hearse
And someone save my soul tonight, please save my soul

-Chorus-

And as these days watch over time, and as these days watch over time
And as these days watch over us tonight
I'll never let them, I'll never let them
I'll never let them hurt you now tonight
I'll never let them, I can't forget them
I'll never let them hurt you, I promise

Struck down, before our prime
Before, you got off the floor
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
Can you stake me before the sun goes down?


this song gives me a headache whenever i listen to it"

"event","""I watched the sky as we drove toweard the town center. It was a clear night and you could see the Milky Way.
Some people think the Milky Way is a long line of stars, but it isn't. Our galaxy is a huge disk of stars millions of lightyears across, and the solar system is somewhere near the outside edge of the disk.
When you look in direction A, at 90 degrees to the disk, you dont see many stars. But when you look in direction B, you see lots more stars because you are looking into the main body of the galaxy, and because the galaxy is a disk you see a strope of stars.
And then i thought about how for a long scientists were puzzled by the fact that the sky is dark at night, even though there are billions of stars in the universe and there must be stars in every direction you look, so that the sky should be full of starlight because there is very little in the way to stop the light from reaching earth.
Then they worked out that the universe was expanding, that the stars were all rushing away frm one another after the Big Bang, and the further the stars were away from us the faster they were mo ving, some of them nearly as fast as the speed of light, which was why their light never reached us.
I like this fact. It is somethying you can work out in your own mind just by looking at the sky above your head at night and thinking without having to ask anyone.
And when the universe has finished exploding, all the stars will slow down, like a ball that has been thrown into the air, and they will come to a halt an dhtye will all begin to fall toward the center of the universe again. And then there will be nothing to stop us from seeing all the stars in the world because they will all be moving toward us, gradually faster and faster, and we will know that the world is going to end soon because when we look up itno the sky at night there will be no darkness, just the blazing light of billions and billions of stars, all falling.""

So yeah yesterday was good i went to lake oswego to find people after the concert. couldnt find anyone for awhile so i sat in westridge park for about a half an hour which was nice. watched the bats and stars. So then i decided to move and i ended up at cutlers. i called david and they said they were comin soon so i hung out with cutlers dad and talked about final fantasy which was actually fun and intresting. if i had a playstation 2 id play that shit. but i dont. so fuck you. gamecubes better anyways. but anyway..... yeah they got there and nick and claudio were there and it was a party. so then we went to kennys and chilled. god claudio is such a beast hes seriously all bruce lee style ripped. dont step on his bed! he'll chop you in half. and nick started speaking this strange language and it was odd. i need to hang out with those guys before they leave forever. so then me and cutler drove to cutlers house which was a little scary. then me and cutler stayed up until 3 eating and watching family guy. then we went to bed and i was ass tired. we listened to mum and i thought of sad moments in my life until i fell asleep.

so now i have some chores to do. Theres a party today at davids that i want to go to but dont think i'll be able to get away from here today. i have class tonight and then welding in the morning so i cant be out tonight and today looks pretty filled. makes me sad to kina waste days like these. summers allready going by to fast. i havent seen that tommy kid yet this summer =( and i havent hung out with blake and jon and nik as much as i want to. bleh i need more sleep than what i got last night. i might take a nap. but i neeed a shower because im greasy. its one of those days where i either want to be with my friends or just be sleeping. grrrr i need to do things

"event","So im back from the beach. just got back about 20 mins ago. I drove and it was kinda scary because there was alot of fast moving traffic and everyone was fucking tailgating me. but it was fun anyways

so this weekend in recap

Friday: got to see my lover for a little which was good. im going to miss her but shes having loads of fun in mexico. we left at around three and i wore my tuxedo to the beach because i didnt feel like changing. so we drive there and i convince my dad to let me put in some franz (i dont think he liked it) and then we eat at this weird little restauraunt and lots of people were staring at me i think because i was wearing my tux (i had fish and chips and scary looking potato salad that i didnt eat) so then we make it home and i work for a copule hours and the minimum wage of 6 dollars a hour is installed. bed is soon relized

Saturday: mostly working during the day. disasmebling this deck so the roof guys can come in and fix our shitty roof at the beach. so then after work my dad and i went crabbing and didnt catch shit. no one on the pier was catching anything and we had to share a little place with these two old fat smoking ladys. but it was funny because they dropped their lighter between the cracks of the wood and they freaked out because they couldnt smoke anymore so one of them had to go all the way back to the car to get a lighter. i laughed and then felt bad but dismissed the bad feeling and laughed some more. so then there was some dinner and then i watched Tank Girl with the Fam. good movie. actually most everyone hates it but i have a soft spot for it for some reason. so then they go to bed and i have three shots of vodka and go look at the stars on the beach for awhile which was very nice. then bed

Sunday: woke up late and had some lunch cleaned up the house and did alittle more work and then left.

so i made a bunch of money this weekend. i need to save alot of it for the aquabats concert though. I CANT WAIT! ooooo. i just relized that kellys coming back in less than a month now I ALSO CANNOT WAIT. summers nearing the half over mark. it makes the sadness present im my life.

so yeah. everyones at warped tour which makes me sad. but i want to hang with peeps afterwards so yeah if anyones not at warped tour give me a call cause im bored and when cutler and or kenny and crew get back from there give me a call 2.2.3.4.6.5.3. is da number

im going to go find something to do.

last night i was attacked by a flesh eating killer moth. i think i shooed it out of the room though. but im not sure it cours still be in here

yesterday i got a 90$ used jacket (so the retail price is probably even more than that) at Mr. Formal for 20$ they're selling some clearance stuff for dirt cheap so if anyone needs a jacket or anything thats da place to go.

so yea now i have three tailjackets wouldnt it be cool if i just wore suits all the time? if your going to put clothes on why not dress nicely.

i have to go eat breakfast now"

"event","I'm here all alone
there is not an item of clothing on my body that is not red
besides my boxers
i need to get some red boxers
and im not wearing socks
but i dont have red socks
someone get me some red boxers and socks
the only bad thing about wearing all read though is someone might think im in a gang
but i like red
favorite color
and if i want to wear it then godamnit i will
alot of it
someone get me some more red clothes
it would be cool if all i wore from now on was red
but i wouldnt be able to wear my zelda stuff
so maybe just red and black

"event","So i installed the sims (deluxe edition 2002) on the new(old) computer and it ran fine but i unintalled it because the sims never really tickled my fancy at all. then i tried to intall worms armageddon and it didnt work because it says it doesnt run on windows NT or something like that and then i changed the compatibility mode to windows 98 and it still didnt work. which makes me sad but i dont think its that computer because it wouldnt work on this one either

(just went to go get stuff for my welding class. time 5:09)

My dad came home and was like YO WERE GOING so i couldnt update this i got a nifty welding cap and mask thing and some gloves i look like some kind of cool space dude.

so i have some sad news i really dont think im going to be able to go to warped tour again this year. i just dont have any money or anywhere to get it and even if i did i think im required to go to the beach this weekend because my dad needs help with some porch thing there. so yeah really lame. and i wont be able to see jessie on her last day here but i'll be able to on friday. hopefully some japanese garden will go down.

today has been odd and lethargic. found a song for it. i love finding songs for moods so here it is by depeche mode


Comatose, almost
You've got me dreaming
Slipping in
And Sliding out
Of conscious feeling

Take a light
Start the flame
Play the game
I am lost
In your eyes
Hypnotised

Here I believe
Dreams never deceive

Comatose, almost
You've got me dreaming
Slipping in
And sliding out
Life has no meaning

Bodies move
Colours change
Girl you're strange
Here inside
I'm at home
I'm alive

Don't be afraid
I'm floating away

Comatose, almost
You've got me dreaming
Slipping in
And sliding out
Of conscious feeling

Comatose, almost

Comatose, almost

Comatose.

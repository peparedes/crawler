you can't really see the different shades in what i did, 
but i wasn't wearing makeup and was camera shy :\

the love of my life is coming in 17 days.
and he gets to be my hot winter formal date&hearts;

school almost kicked my ass last week.
i may look into getting some kind of sedative prescription for test anxiety.
that'd be alot cooler, so i wouldn't hyperventilate/vomit before midterms and shit.

nicotine update: 4th time to quit.
officially 7 non-smoking days after my 3rd relapse.
sigh.

over and out.

ever had constant butterflies for 4 days?
<b>it's pretty nice.</b>
blake forgot his cologne and said i could KEEP IT.
ohhh yeah.

NO MORE CIGARETTES FOR ME:

so i don't get lung cancer
so i can still take birth control 
so i won't have an old man cough
so i'll have one less addiction and $8 more a week. 
and because my boyfriend is doing it too :)

THE END.

wish me luck. 
you know i'll just end up smoking more pot.
meh."

""damn the man, save the empire""</li><li><b> fun earrings</b>:<br>since i cut my hair supershort i think sometimes fun earrings look awkward but i used to wear big earrings all the time. i always lose one of them when i'm drunk, so i also have quite an extensive collection of mismatched earrings. </li><li><b> jello shots</b>:<br>my record is 17 jello shots, along with 4 cups of punch and prepartying at one of the rugby parties last year. i remember keeping them stuffed in my pockets/shirt, and having like 6 on me at any given time. i'm a big fan of the red and the orange, but they never have green which is the shit. i WILL beat my record this year, just you wait. </li><li><b> making out</b>:<br>yes yes and yes.

"event","so, my sorority wants me to wear a wig during rush.
our advisor approached me about 6 hours into the 12 hour long first day of work week, and told me that if i didn't dye my hair i'd have to be ""behind the scenes"" (not rushing girls).. which really pissed me off becausse i can't dye my effing hair again or it will fall out.

i wanted to punch a bitch in the face. i have all of my shit for rush all together, i bought all my required shit way ahead of time and i was totally prepared. now i can't rush girls because i have pink and purple hair? WTF. nowhere is it written down specific mandatory hair colors.. you can't do that, it's called DISCRIMINATION, MOTHER FUCKERS. 

THEN someone suggested i wear a wig. And somewhere in the middle of this drama they made me cry my face off, i had a panic attack, said fuck sororities, threatened to quit, and didn't show up yesterday. 

apparently then a bunch of the girls started a petition saying they love me as i am and don't want me to change and won't let me wear a wig. but then those girls got yelled at. i'm really touched, though. 

i'm sick of this bullshit, but i heard through the grapevine that the old ladies were talking about how they can't lose me in the chapter and how much they need me for rush because i'm one of the most outgoing and personable people in our chapter, WHAM. and not to toot my own horn *toot toot*.. but its TRUE.

i'm going to talk with them now, hopefully with some kind of non-lame resolution. 
i'll keep you posted.

oh, and i've been made into a hot cartoon:

facebook is scary.. apparently they send you messages asking if you're actually someones ""girlfriend"".
*DUN DUN DUNNNN*

i've been listening to waaay too much rilo kiley.
and i'm also strangely fascinated that one of them was on salute your shorts. and boy meets world.
i mean.. c'mon.. thats pretty much pimp as shit.

anyway, summer school sucks.
margaritas from eskimo hut do not.
also, using an ID to purchase aforemetioned margaritas that obviously isnt yours is awesome too.

everyone is invited to come over and play at my new garage apartment!! you can sleep on the amazing green futon and roll around on my shag rug. AND you have to check out the effing hot nightstand that i BUILT. that's right. almost all of my furniture came unassembled and my mom and i had no idea. so, i definately assembled a nightstand, bitches. it has a little cd rack on it and a drawer and these 2 fancy silver poles that support half of it, its effing sweet. i am so proud of it. my brother was up until 5am putting together my bed and dressers and shit, but the nightstand is the highlight of it all.

i leave for hawaii tomorrow for 2 weeks with the fam, and im more than a little excited. golden goddess status, here i come. also: me vs. skin cancer.. it's ONNNNNNN.

i heart the east coast, but only in small doses. 

i can't wait until may 31st, when i come home and i get to move into my new garage apartment (minus a bed, and all furniture except a desk and kitchen table set.. who wants to come over for a slumber party on the floor?!) my mom is doing alot of shit for me, which is cool.. she's ordering me a bed and mattress and dressers and all that good stuff plus a sofa bed and having it shipped to texas for when i get back from south padre on the 9th. so that will be fabulous. except the assembling everything part. (do things normally come shipped fully in tact?) 

a beautiful black man with long dreadlocks, more piercings than me and gorgeous tattoos all over his arms is going to fix my hair sometime this week and i couldn't be more excited. 

i see my grandmother on sunday = fat cash for me.

i also got a new cell that should be in working order tuesday or wednesday, so feel free to text me lots and lots because my phone is no longer ghetto, awesome.

june 25- july 6: effing HAWAII

after that is summer school and perhaps some work and blah but aside from that, i'm PUMPED about the upcoming months. fosho. although i did realized today how much i'm going to miss seeing everyone everyday at school. not at school, but like in passing and such. meh.

i have definately been on a wine kick lately.

"event","as i have said before in one of my christmas break entries, pennsylvania is worthless, but enjoyable.. ish.  
i'm here for 6 days, whereupon i will gorge myself on sleep, free food, and donations from family members. 

here's an update, for those of you who care.

- my dad didn't kill me when he saw my rainbow brite hair. (this is a good thing)
- and i still got an ipod for no apparent reason, aside from the fact my dad got a fatty bonus and likes to spend money. (this is also a good thing)
- i saw my grandparents and their new house on the farm in maryland, they didn't kill me either. (although it seems the popular response to my lip stud is ""it looks like a booger. i want to pull it off your face"" my reply: ""i'm a bleeder, be careful with the pulling. messes are bad"")
- got fat cash from the aforementioned g-parents for my recent academic ass-kickery.(the best part was they each gave me money seperately, and i don't know if they know that they BOTH gave me ridiculous amounts of cash... score?)
- tomorrow the mom and i are headed to the biggest mall in the east coast to hit up their 2-story urban outfitters hardcore for the upcoming birthday. (this means more pretty skirts and scandalous tshirts and earrings oh my! *insane amounts of giddiness*)
- i have since decided that knowing zero people in the lovely state of pennsylvania is rather liberating. it's like an amazing escape from reality, ish. east coast style, so there's less skirt wearing and a few more goose-bumps, but i dig it. 
- friday nicole and leah are picking me up from the airport where i will be greeted with scandality and then their fine asses are staying the night in funkytown with me. it shall be glorious.
- myspace will be the death of me, i swear.
- the best way to wake up is someone telling you you're beautiful, it's true. 

all for now, i love all of you..

and since i'm east coast i'll throw in a little profanity..
PEACE OUT BITCHES <3"

"event","this weekend was the absolute shit.

(and to clarify, because i heard that sometimes it is a tricky concept, the shit= a good thing)

friday, eisley rocked my face off twice. aside from a few minor faintingish episodes, i got free water brought to me by a bouncer and mike and raul got effing eisley to SIGN MY SHIRT. it's true. 

saturday was absolute beauty. chipotle, full throttle, 17 jello shots, 4 cups of punch, 2 boys, and a denver omlette later, i am the champion. i haven't had that much fun in a very long time. 

and mike is definately my hero for getting KICKED OUT.

**reminder to me, i owe john for breakfast.

and on a foodish note, i have been seriously hardcore jonesing for some on the border doublestacked quesodillas.

that's all i got. 

and i invite all of you to have amazing weekends as well. :)

and ps- mike, im serious about making the non-dating tshirts. 4 seperate boys on saturday asked if you were my boyfriend. what the hell, stop doing that. we also need to stop matching. 

this should begin ASAP, for the sake of both of our sex lives."

"event","it's been a damn long time.. lazy much? i was originally taking 16 hours this semester, but considering my ass hasn't ever taken any more than 13, i panicked and begged my mom to let me drop a class (again).
so my slacker ass is chillin at 12 hours, and i am quite content. i will officially never graduate, be in college forever, and never technically have to grow up. life is good. 

i stole this from currently the coolest kid at tcu, michael best. it's pretty scary, if you ask me.

**Did you know that those sneaky jerks at Sure dared anyone who doubted their product to put their normal deodorant on under their right arm and Sure on under their left. Well guess what? Most people are right handed, and because of that their right pit is going to get a lot sweatier most likely.** 

DO YOU BELIEVE THAT SHIT?! AN OUTRAGE I TELL YOU! AND... 

**When Pepsi used to do those taste test things to see if coke or pepsi was better, they would label the two cups, one with an O and the other with an M. Before doing this, they did tests to see what letter was the prefered one. Then when people drank the two, they were more likely to pick the O cup, simply because they both tasted pretty similar, but they prefered the letter O. **

.. and i SO TOTALLY would have picked O. 

BASTARDS.

that's all i got. 

i love all of you.

ps- go to my website -- http://community.webshots.com/user/karibear42 -- and tell me what you think about the new piercing, please. i still haven't quite decided, but i'm leaning towards liking it. meh."

i just told my mom that i'm not a virgin.

aww that was cute.. except i need to kiss someone on the fucking beach, damnit. bc that'd be way hot.
so there.

ps- the shuler grandparents didn't notice the (2)steel bars through my face. either that or they didn't say anything, which i guess is better than the speranzella grandparents giving me lots of shit and threatening to cut off my funding if i pierce/tattoo anything else..

pps- my parents told me today i'm ""not the kind of girl you take home to mom""

WOW. *beams with pride* mission accomplished. 

.. so, is it the piercings? :/"

and to all a good night.

ps- i love holidays with my brother and i'm SO glad he's finally arrived to save me from the slow painful death that is valley forge, pennsylvania. for some reason, it's cool with my mom for us to get quite shitty drunk together as long as we're bonding and such. plus, she knows we get high and have gotten tattoos together, so she might as well encourage other illegalities just for kicks, right?

"event","hmm.. i guess this is interesting. although it was tied with christian, the buddhist thing won the tiebreaker questionn, and i think it might work for me. it was only done out of sheer boredom though since i don't really do the religion thing anymore, but i really like how i'm closer to buddhist, cult, anarchist AND jewish before catholic. awesome.

way to go Bishop Lynch.

actually, i blame it on baylor.

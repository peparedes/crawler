This is what happens when you use Hocus Pocus, sometimes more often than not. I got it quite a few times tonight. >_< Along with instant death. Though I did get to spawn Moonie. :D

"event","<small>I got the 2s Arbalest... now just to get up enough money for <b>two</b> mummy cards... *Sighs* That's another two mil. Damn those weapons for being so expensive; damned thing cost me 1.5 mil. I'm down to 700k. *Whine*

I actually thought about selling the Angelwings that <lj user=ashiron> bought, just to get better equipment. But I can't do that. ;_;


[Edit: I ended up buying one mummy card as <lj user=ashiron> told me to do using his money, but now I feel horrible. I owe him 950k. *Sighs* Where am I going to get that money? I wish my stuff would sell already...]"

"event","<small>Okay so I was just having a conversation with <lj user=ashiron> and here is how it went:

<b>Ash:</b> Spam mail.. one of them from...
<b>Ash:</b> ""Makayla""
<b>Me:</b> That's funny.
<b>Ash:</b> ""Pick your pleasure""
<b>Ash:</b> Hmmm.
<b>Me:</b> My munak sent you an email!
<b>Me:</b> Oh dear. I must go scold her now.
<b>Ash:</b> Heh.

Remind me tomorrow to take her out of her egg and repremand her for sending him junk mail. Naughty munak, who would have thought she'd end up naughty like me? ^^;;

"event","<small>Things have been going well recently since I joined the new guild. Of course Ash joined with me, since we kind of didn't want to be apart, and it helps that we're both support priests. Tesla and Shereth might join as well, since another bard and a battle blacksmith is needed. Oh and of course I can't forget Seeth, he's there, but hasn't said much - said he had to tank his female friend this weekend. Uh huh. Heh. He's a good priest though.

And as for the guild, it's great. I'm really happy there 'cept for one little thing. Well, two. I have a bit of a problem with two guildmates - the sage that was just recruited last night - he's really whiny and full of himself, but I'm sure that will change when he's been in the guild a few days. And the other problem is Royal; while we were all partied, he took practically all the loot, and ran off ahead of the priests (Ash and myself) then I heard while in prisons, with just Ash as the only priest, he died and was like ""res plzz"" after he ran off and got himself killed. I'm sorry but I have no love for someone who does that. But same with him hopefully he'll change or else he'll find a lack of a priest to party with, because Ash was a little upset by it as well.

Although I talked to Evan last night while I was in GY, he's really nice and I look forward to partying with him sometime. Oh he's a level 55 assassin. And everyone else in the guild is really nice, which is cool, even the leader - she's really nice.

And so now I sit in Prontera, just watching the people walk by, because I've nothing better to do at the moment. Although at 6pm I have to snag Shereth, Maluna, Ash and Dennise and drag them to Comodo for the Loki DB party. Hopefully more people will come as well. And if they do, I think it'll be fun. In fact, I should probably go buy some DBs for the party.

So, in that case, I'm off to go hunt around for cheap dead branches, since I'm next to broke 'cause nobody will buy my knight equipment and since I just recently bought an earring and a cele mitten. Such expensive stuff. Oi.

"event","<small>I suppose I should make a post, since afterall, I told <lj user=ashiron> that I'd make a post if he did, and he held his end of the deal, although it was a short entry. I could do an even shorter entry, but I won't do that to him.

In any case, we both joined this new guild last night, called <b>Silent Dawn</b> and the guild leader is really nice; haven't gotten to meet all the guild members yet. However, there is one thing I'm wary of, that's the fact Ash and I are the only two priests in the guild. I suppose it won't be so bad, but hopefully things won't go sour and they try and split us up constantly in parties, cause that'd be kind of depressing. I rather like leveling with him.

But we'll see, as time goes on. For now, I shall end this entry and continue my leveling with my dearest...

"event","So my life isn't exactly going in the diretion I want it to right now, that is absolutly no reason to take it out on Irene. We were having a good time talking last night, her telling me of her impressions of the place and people and such like. Somewhere along the line it went a bit sour, mainly when I wanted to figure out when I could get to talk to her today. I have my second interview starting at 2pm and I have no idea how long it'll last, quite possibly until after 5pm. This will most likly mean I won't be back before she has to take her English exam thing, which could be as long as four hours. I said I would stay awake late so we would get some time together. Then she raised the fact that she will be meeting up with other new international students, some even from Luton Uni, and that may well turn into a social event leading to her not being online. I asked to be kept updated on what she is doing so I can do my things accordingly. This quickly degraded into her thinking I was being too controlling and she doesn't feel like she can enjoy herself if she cannot be spontaneous. I was trying to say that I don't want to stop her having fun, just that I'd prefer to know if I should wait for her or not. I, in my tired and agitated state certainly did not word it in the best way possible and ended up hurting myself and my love. I assured her as best as I could that I was sorry and she shouldn't just sit around waiting for me as I wait for her. After turning the computer off, I got around a single hour of sleep, and simply lay in my bed from about 1:30am onwards, whishing for sleep but not bing able to stop my mind from going through all the better ways I could have handled things or simply not bothered to ask when I would see her again.

At about 5:30am I got bored of sitting in the dark so I turned my machine on. Irene was online as it was only about 11pm for her, we then got about making our apologies and trying to sort things out. By sort things out, it pretty much dampened down to Irene gets to do what Irene wants, and I get whatever is left. If she hangs out with people after her exam, then I won't know about it, but if she doesn't, she'll go back to her room and sign on and wait for me. If she doesn't, I just have to be less of a worrier and put up with it. Hopefully, once she settles down into her clases and routine, we'll have a more normal way of doing things. Until then, I just have to sit tight I guess.

As for my interview this afternoon, I don't really know what is going to happen or what the code will look like, but hell, I'm giving it a shot if he's willing to take the time out and let me see and work on the code for a couple of hours, then I'm sure as hell going to give it my best. Try and wow him with side-tracks like the fact I can work with UML for ISO documentation, and being a decent public speaker for those pre-sales talks. Keep everything crossed that can be people. Thanks.

Out."

"event","After not sleeping so well for a while now, I crashed quite late last night, calling Irene every so often to see if she had made it in to her room yet. But no such luck. Not that i was expecting much, she had so much stuff to get through.
This morning, as usual, I awoke stupidly early, about 6:30am, thinking that in Pensacola it's half-past midnight, and if she's there she might still be up. Before even turning on the light, I grabbed my cordless phone (well, I had to find it somewhere in the bed as I'd accidently fell asleep with it) and hit redial. The next thing I hear I can only ever describe as pure, unadulterated, angelic, sweetness. Just hearing her voice after wanting it so madly left me flustered and I even had some trouble forming any sort of coherent speach, and bless her, she was so tired she wasn't doing too well either. The she said some of the most reliving words a geek could ever hear, ""Why don't you get online"". Oh boy do I ever love that woman!! So, we talked a bit while I booted up my machine at which point she drops another bombshell on me... She finally got that webcam!! Oh for over a week now since I've even seen the woman and she just shows up and casually asks if I want to see her now. Hehehehe. We didn't have that much time as I had to go to my sister's and mind my nephew, and Irene was so incredily sleepy, but it was enough to put the biggest smile on my face for all day!! Not only did my woman wait up for me, not knowing if I would even get online before going, but I got to speak to her, see her, and read an email from her all together!! Wow!! 

So, now a quick note to Shelly, if she's reading this, thank you and Eddie so much for taking care of Irene and putting her up in your house. Oh, and for the TV as well, she told me how great that was at least 4 times in the short time I spoke to her this morning!!

Oh, I'm being forced to go now as I have to sing along to Snow Patrol's Chasing Cars with Xander.

I'm out kids, take care."

"event","Well, after a disturbingly huge delay in Atlanta, I think Irene is finally tucked away with Shelly. I don't know for sure though, since she wrote me an email in Atlanta, but her flight from Atlanta to Mobile was canceled. The email was sent at a ridiculously late\early time, which may account her going on the next flight instead. But she didn't add a PS or anything of any note to tell me she actually landed in Mobile at all. 

Add to the fact that she has to spend a <i>lot</i> of time sorting out her new life today. Picking up keys,moving in to her new place, shopping, learning the new city... I doubt she'll take time out to find an internet cafe or set her laptop to use the network connection with so much else on. I just really hate the not knowing. I don't know when I'll speak to her again, nor when I'll get to see her again. Sure, she's coming back for Xmas, but only for three weeks, and I suspect she's going to want to try and spend some time at home and show her family how much she wants to mend things with them. Obviously, I can only support that, even if it does mean I'm only going to e with her for less than a week after four months of separation. Heck, if I have to go to Spain, I may not even get that if I have to get time off from a job.

This needs to work out..."

I've lost all motivation for anything right now. I haven't spoken to my old uni lecturers or anything to see if I can get my 2:1 bumped up to a first. I haven't applied applied for a job in two weeks. I haven't even spoken to the bloke who is meant to be fixing my TV. I haven't left my house for anything other than babysitting for the last week. I haven't spoken to anyone who wasn't my sister, her son, or my girlfriend this week.

Irene goes off in four days. I really really need to find something to fill my time. I have nothing and I do nothing and it's driving me stir crazy. And I don't do anything to change it."

"event","Over a month without an update, and it's not like I've got anything else to fill my days with so here goes...

I got through a couple of weeks of absolutely nothing happening by basically sitting and starting at either the TV or the computer, playing games and whatnot. The monotony was broken by people coming online now and again. Most notably James from back in my Luton days who I am trying to persuade to come up to Leicester for a visit. Plus, he might be able to help me fit my car stereo.

Oh yes, car news!! I managed to fuck up my insurance premiums for the first ever time a couple of weeks ago. Nothing big, but when I went over to Stephen's place I pulled into the drive a little too quick and traded some paint with his step-mum's parked car. Still, once I'd cleaned it up a touch you could hardly tell there was a dent. Stephen, though, had to be a goody-two-shoes and text them as soon as they got back off holiday to tell them. Little git wouldn't even keep his trap shut until she noticed... Ah well, I'll just not be giving him too many lifts from now on since I'm not exactly welcome over there now.

Also, though it was very bloody close to the line, Irene managed to make the flight and visited for me for a week. Oh boy what a week it turned out to be. Thankfully, <lj user=""karaden""> was going to be in Luton anyways so she kindly offered to head over a day early and let Irene &amp; I crash at her place. Good bloody thing too, since Irene's flight was delayed quite a bit and we both had to hang out at the airport for her. Waiting for her to walk through the doors made was one of the most tormenting things ever, every time a bunch of people starting coming through my heart skipped a beat. Everytime she wasn't among the pack it sank back down hard. Oh was she ever a sight for my eyes when she finally made it through. I think I just hugged her for a good few minutes before either of us spoke. The first thing that happened when we left the airport was Irene throwing her arms around me, standing on her tiptoes giving my a sweet kiss before she succumbed to needing a cigarette. We headed back to Kate's place for the night, or what was left of it. We headed back up to Leicester the next day and proceeded to have some lovely times, hanging out, going places, and what not. One day we went to Foxton Locks, just for that sake of going out somewhere and it was oddly very enjoyable. I mean, walking out in the country with a friend and love, just enjoying the company and the time with such a wonderful and relaxing person. After time had done is inevitable moving on without thought or regard for those of enjoying the now too much to give it up quite so soon, the week was spent and I had to take Irene back to Luton to catch her flight back to Spain.
In some personal news, Irene now knows she is definitely going to the University of West Florida for an academic year for further her marketing &amp; advertising studies. When I first realised I was getting close to Irene, this weighed quite heavily upon my mind. I had already lost one serious relationship to the struggle of time and distance combined, and there was a large part of me that didn't want her to go. Now, whenever she asked me for help and advice, I gave it to her to the best of my ability and did not want to actually get in the way of her achieving her dreams. As time passed and it dawned on my just how much she wanted to go and how dedicated to her cause she was, the very selfish side of me began to dwindle away and I got angry at myself for ever thinking badly of her plans. She easily picked up on this, despite being in different countries, and told me flat out that it made her really upset to know I wasn't behind her all the way in both thought and deed. I guess that finally knocked my last ounce of doubt out of the ballpark and now when I hear that she finally gets to enroll on her classes and has her accommodation sorted I am so very genuinely pleased. I am going to miss the woman, but I have a feeling that she'll miss me too, and I'll be able to see her again at Xmas, as long as she still wants to at that point. She even made a comment that after her year away finishes, she'll have 5 months in which she could look for a temp marketing job in the UK to be near me. Now I know as well as anybody how many things could change between now and then, but for her to be thinking about making plans for the future that still include me mean a great deal. I also began to realise that one of my major issues with her going, was not the fact that she's going to be away, but rather she is going to be doing all these new and exciting things and going through some experiences and I won't be able to be there to share in them with her and go through it all together. One of the reasons the trip to Warsaw was such a great one was not the trip, but the company and the shared experiences. It would have probably been just as good, if a little different, had I gone with someone else or even alone, but going some place new when you can share the excitement and enjoyment to me makes it all the more special.

Oh yeah, and I finally got my degree results passed, I got a 2:1, but it's a close call so I'm going to contest it and see if I can get it bumped up to a first class degree. Still, you can now call me Mr Timothy Simon Jones BSc Hons. Booyah.

Now I'm going to get showered and dressed since it's nearly 2pm and I'm still in my jammies. Laters"

"event","Had another thunder storm this morning, even knocked the pwoer out again!! Thankfully, only for about 15min this time around.

The phones have stayed up and everything, so I've managed to get a lot done. NTL cocked up my cancellation thingy, so it's not going to be properly cut off until August, but I threw a hissy fit because I'd already tried to get it cancelled and they said I wouldn't be charged for the extra month. Just got to wait and see if that actually happens though...

I had to get up at 7am this morning to get the car into the garage nice and early. Pete knows what's wrong with it and what needs to be done to pass the MOT so hopefully I should have a fully roadworthy car by this evening, or at least before the post office shuts so I can go and get some tax for the bloody thing too.

I called CIS with my newly-found old policy number and got them to send me a certificate of No Claims, but instead of it being two years as we'd thought, it was only one as I didn't earn any as a provisional driver. So now I've got to call Admiral and tell them so they can carge me and extra leg to make up the difference. Bloody annoying but must be done.

I also called the Job Center people, but I can't sign up for benifits until the end of term date has passed, which is, annoyingly, June 9th, 3 days time... Still, I'll call Monday and everything should be happy from then.

Irene managed to come online earlier today as well, which was really great for me. It's great the way she can clear my mind of all the doubt and worry and really make me believe that I have something extordinarily special in her. ANyways, she is taking Kate &amp; Peter out of Madrid today to a nice little town her dad is lecturing at or something, then coming back home. She even says that she is going to forego her siesta to get some time to talk to me, bless her.

Anyways, it's getting on for two and I'm going to grab some lunch while I wait for Irene to come online. I'll update later with how everything goes and if my car is fixed on time, oh how I need those wheels!!

"event","Well, fuck me that was one hell of a thunderstorm...

Big enough, in fact, to knock out power in my area. Proper EMP action going on!! No power here at home (thank root for laptops), no phones, car &amp; house alarms sounding. Rather interesting, can't even make myself a cup of tea without getting half of the kitchen utensils out to find the old metal gas-cooker kettle. Proper coffee is well out of the question!!

Judging by my laptop clock, power has been out now for over an hour. It's 11:45am as I write this, but, of course, I cannot update LJ yet, bloody internet requiring power... Damn them!!

Dad just came in and woke me up, apparently, power has been off since about 10am this morning. Also, I found out why the phones are down too, apparently, whole whole of Oadby has no power at all. No traffic lights, no schools, no shops, nothing has power. Dad said he saw some accidents on his way over here, but nothing too serious.

Well, it's 12:30pm now and it doesn't look like we'll be getting power back any time soon so I'm going to try and dream a little more.

3:20pm, mum came home early, about an hour ago maybe. It was so great to finally have some company that I actually waited outside the front door and gave her a big hug as she walked in. The power situation is a lot worse it seems, much of Leicester is out of power, and I can't get any local radio stations on my mp3 player either so it's hard to tell what is going on. Mum sat down in the front room as I made her a cup of tea on the stove. We sat and talked as adults for quite a while. She asked about Irene and how she was, and because she cared, she asked how I was getting on about that situation. I told her pretty much what I've written here in the past few weeks. We discussed relationships, both hers and mine, for a time. Mum told me how she liked Irene, how she enjoyed her company, and how happy she made me. We talked about how we cope with different relationship issues, how she left Father and how hard it was, and how my relationships with April and Wiz were that much different from that with Irene. It was a really good talk, and I managed to get some more things off my chest, and mum comforted me as she can do.

The power has been out for something like 5hrs 30mins now. Mum says it went off at different times around Leicester. It went out at about 10am this morning here in Oadby, but about 30mins later than that in south Wigston where she works. I had stuff I could have been getting on with today, getting my insurance sorted, more job hunting, getting registered for Job Seekers allowance, finding out why NTL are still charging me for my Luton internet line, or even staring at my mail client waiting for an email from Irene. I can't help waiting on her word, but I do know that hearing from her makes each day easier to bear. Gosh that woman has done something funny to me, she really is quite something special.

4:10pm. Bloody stupid radio bloody people... We just clambered into mum's car to listen to the hourly news update just to be told that Oadby, Wigston, and Knighton are still out of power. No bloody shit sherlock... Then, they said quite possibly the stupidest things ever... For a full update and to keep track of when power will be restored, check their website. Bloody marvellous thinking guys, fucking fantastic. Why didn't I think about turning my computer on, which needs power, and to modem, which needs power, and connecting to the local ISP, who need power, and surf the web a bit?? Oh yeah, that's right, THEY ALL NEED FUCKING POWER. Stupid bloody radio muppets.

5:15pm. Still nothing on the power front. Mum has decided that her time will be better spent sleeping it off and so is now snoring her little heart out on the sofa. Dad should be home in about 20mins, maybe he'll have some news from the radio about how everything is getting on. Bloody stupid thunderstorms, bloody stupid power substations not being properly tested. It's a good job I turn this laptop off after writing each of these little updates otherwise I'd be completely without any way of doing this. Hopefully, the power should be back on soon, a couple of areas have been fixed apparently, so maybe they'll finally get on to ours next. It has been over 7 hours without power now...

6:40pm. WE. HAVE. POWER!!!!

I will never ever ever go offline again!!"

"event","Well, it's certainly been an eventful week and no mistake about that...

Irene came up to Leicester twice in the two weeks I've been home. I guess we are just throwing ourselves in to each other while we still can. The last time she came up was unbelievably good, nothing in particular, mind, just everything worked so well together, it wasn't a problem that we pretty much spent every moment of every day of nearly a week underneath each others heels. We slept, drank coffee, talked, walked, cooked for my family, everything together, and it seemed to work well.

Thursday rolled around and I had to take her home, she had to move all her things and get ready for her flight. I was driving her to the train station, and she held my hand, looked over to me, and told me she wished I could drive her back to Luton, just so we could spend another couple of hours together. What could I do but turn the car around and head on off to the motorway??

Down the motorway I drove, desperate to spend as much time as I could with the woman who has affected me as much as I hope I affected her. In true Irene style, she got bored with the motorway about half-way through the journey and so we pulled off and stopped for a while in this little town we couldn't figure out the name of, all the signs simply said 'Town Centre', way to go local council people... Anyways, I just pulled off to the side of the road and we crossed over, just to find ourselves in a bit of a wooded area. We walked around it for a while, enjoying the peace and the nature, until we stumbled upon the edge of a golf course. So, we did the thing that most non-members do on a golf course, we invaded it and found a nice place to sit down and lay in the sun for a while :-D After a little smoke on Irene's part, a little talking and a little fun, Irene decided she needed a souvenir, so she stole the flag from the closest pole and we ran like children back into the woods with our prize.

Back to the motorway we went, and back to Luton I drove. We got to her place, I parked up, and we unloaded her things from my car, and went into her house. We hugged, we kissed, Irene tried to get me to stay for dinner, but I couldn't take being with her for much longer knowing that it was finally at its end and she was going. So we kissed and hugged some more, I told her that I loved her, and she parroted my words back to me. She shed a few tears, too, but I didn't know if they were from her pain at loosing me, or her knowledge of my pain at loosing her. I couldn't stay much longer, it was hurting a little too much for me to keep it in any longer, so I left. She came to the door as I got into my car and drove away, I piped my horn as I drove away from her.

The drive home, I can hardly remember, other than I got fed up of the motorway so I drove through the country instead on the way home. It was a change, but I hardly noticed it really. As soon as I got home and parked up, I walked straight into my sitting room and sat down on the sofa with my mother, who just let me curl up into her and cry myself dry for a while. She never said a word, just put her arm around me, and let me get it all out while I needed to. After I was done, mum just gave me a kiss and a tissue and told me everything will be all right eventually, just on the way mothers do, and because she was my mother, it comforted me for a while.

It has been only a few days since I took Irene back, but it feels like I've been missing her for months. She asked me what I wanted to happen, and I told her, I want her to get her placement at UWF, I want her to have a great year and to finish what she started nearly ten years ago nearby, then I want her to come back to finish her degree, and come back to me, to be ready for something long-term and formal, to be my best friend and my woman. I couldn't tell her then that as much as I want her to achieve her dreams, there is still that nasty little selfish side of me that wanted her not to go, not to leave me after only just finding me, not to have to make me deal with my loneliness again. As much as I hate that part, it is always there and it taunts me.

I hate my brain."

"event","Well, for better or worse I'm now back in Leicester for good...

I feel like I'm leaving too much behind, but also know I now have so much ahead of me.

Had an excellent day on Thursday of which I will update you all on tomorrow or Monday perhaps.

Irene says she'll be coming up sometime during the week once she has finished her application papers, though I don't know for sure. I guess I could understand and fully respect that if she wanted just to make a clean break of it now, even if I don't have to like it.
We got so close in such a short length of time it has scared me so very much. Irene herself has said on muliple occasions that it just gets a little bit better with every passing day, yet she seems to have no problems letting it all slip away as easily as it formed. I know she needs to, but there is still a little part of me that desires to see some part of my pain mirrored in her to know it isn't just me. I know it is selfish and I also know it's only a part of what I am feeling, but it is still there, still making itself known to me. In less than a month she'll be gone to Florida for a year and I'll still be here. She will want to move on and I will want to rekindle. It is just the way it is, and nothing would make me want to change what we had together for anything, my only wish would be for it to have a chance again later. Maybe when she is more ready to make more firm and lasting ties. Ah pipe dreams, how I detest thee.

I'm going to bed now, before I end up hating myself."

Yesterday was an amazing day. Started off way way too early, but since I didn't have an official appointment or anything I just waited around until there was a 15 minute break for me to be seen. Thankfully, someone was running late so I nabbed their spot straight after Matti. I was only asked one question I wasn't really prepared to answer but I blagged it like a pro. The only negative comment my markers had was that it wasn't really readable at two meters. I had to use a smaller font to fit everything in and my monitor was higher contrast than the printer inks so I have to agree with them on that point.

I hung out for a bit, headed over the Costas to meet up with Irene and grab a mocha frescato. Mmmmmmm, caffeine, chocolate, cream, and ice all in one outrageously decadent serving. Most delightful. Then back to uni for the presentation and demonstration.

It all got a little odd from then in, as pretty much half of the entire final year computing students had to descend upon the labs from 1:30-3pm. It wasn't particularly cold that morning, and some bright spark had decided to get the AC units and put them though their service and maintenance. Cue 5 computing labs, each filled with 30+ mainly male students, and 30+ computers running full blast, for nearly 2 straight hours and no AC. It wasn't what one would call a pleasant aroma. Still, one has to perceiver though such trials as life throws at one. I made it through the ordeal and my supervisor and second marker were both impressed at not only the flexibility of use of my application, but that the code being completely reusable too. The only gripe was that I didn't produce a users manual for the application, and that wasn't even needed for the project, just that it would make the life of the next lot of people to use it a bit easier. Score one for me I think.

Once the official business was out of the way, we all got down to the good old unofficial business of mingling. For that we hand a grand old hour, meeting mates, shaking hands, manly bear hugs, not-so-manly-but-more-meaningful proper hugs, and, of course, impromptu photograph sessions. Once the crowds started to dissipate, the few of us hardcore left got together and decided to hit the lovely pub across the road from uni. Exactly as I was going to try and find Irene, she walked into the labs hunting me down, I tell you that woman has some psychic capacity to know when people are going to pubs... So off we headed, people bought people drinks, we all sat outside and exchanged a long list of email addresses, it was fantastic. Then, blessed of the most blessed was I when the heavens themselves answered my call and opened in a torrent of cool, refreshing water.

So, the weak-minded fools decided to get in out of the rain, whereas I knew it was exactly the right time to go for a walk with Irene. It was so beautiful, we walked back to my place to clean up after being rained on, and it was cool enough finally that we could just sit in each others arms without getting too hot and bothered. We walked to her place where she made me a nice meal since I haven't been eating at all properly in the heat. Then we walked back mine and had a seductively cosy evening that ended up being the perfect end to a fantastic day.

This morning I was woken up by a friend in dire need. His bank account had been frozen due to being overdrawn an his dad needed to send him some money. So I acted as intermediary and took the bank transfer. Irene and I lazed in bed and around the house, drinking coffee, watching TV, cuddling, and generally soothing nothingness&nbsp; until we looked at a clock and realised it was midday already, we'd taken half the day sitting around in our undies just hanging out (no pun intended). It was utterly fantastic, even to the point where we pissed Matti off somewhat. Don't know why, but he made a rather snide remark when we were watching TV, he said ""I'd tell you to get a room but you already have one. So just use it"". Considering we weren't even kissing at that point and Irene was wearing one of my tshirts to cover herself up, I think it was rather rude of him. Still, he's gone tomorrow... Yehaw.

That brings me to me, I have to be packed on Friday and back in Leicester on Saturday. Then the job hunt begins in earnest as I begin to apply for every job left, right, &amp; centre. I want to just bum around for a week before winning the lottery, but hey ho, plan B is going to be brought into action instead. Jobs, jobs, glorious jobs. As much as I hate this place, my three years here made me somewhat comfortable in my niche. Going home after this is going to be so difficult, no matter how much mum has tried to make sure dad isn't going to walk into my room as if he owns it, which I guess he does, but that's not the point at all ;-) Still, should only hopefully be a few months before I can afford to walk out, and the place my sister looks to be lining up sounds delightful.

My life is good. confusing, unpredictable, and sometimes a little scary, but good. I must thank each and every one of you for touching it in any way that you have. It has enriched me beyond anything you could possibly imagine.
Thank you.

EDIT: Woo, 1000 word post!! If only writing my dissertation had come so easily I could have hit the 15,000 word mark no sweat!!"

I'm falling for a woman who doesn't believe in it. I'm falling for a woman who I am leaving in a week. But dammit the woman is beautiful and is well worth the turmoil my simple little mind will go through.

Maybe it is the fact that I don't over think when she's around, maybe it is the very point of our not having a future that stops me from worrying where it is all going and how. Maybe it is the simple issues of knowing that I have to give her up so soon that makes me want her so.

No matter how much I know how limited the time is, I cannot help but want it to go on, the company, the touches, the looks, the smiles... Is it so wrong to want that?? I don't think so, but then, in this instance, it does not matter what I want in any way. Irene has, quite literally, the opportunity of a lifetime with her scholarship to University of West Florida with one of the best Marketing departments in the States. There is no way in any consciences, good or bad, I could get in her way of that.

For her sake, she needs to be able to go off without any ties or regrets about leaving. She has said herself, the one thing she doesn't want is to leave for a year and be thinking of only what she is missing back here. I know what needs to happen, but why does it need to be in absolute contradiction to what I desire??

Why do I write this down instead of telling her my feelings?? On one hand, I fear that they will not be reciprocated and this is only just some great experiment for her. I also fear the contrary just as much, or maybe just a little less. The idea that she could actually feel something more than lust for me is as terrifying for me as it is gratifying.

Oh how I wish she were here now, a simple touch of her hand on my brow and these poisonous inner diatribes would evaporate, a smile from her lips and a look from her eyes would cast out any frenetic ideas. The very reason for this post is that she is having a great road trip down to the Isle of Wight with some friends and I'm at a loose end. With no work to keep me busy or Irene to keep me sane, I come up with ramblings like this. It is how my head works, in its own unusual manner. No matter how much I want to just be able to enjoy myself, I can not let things go so easily. I do not want to let things go so easily. I have to let things go so easily.

So, with all this confusion, I'm going to get what I can while I can, enjoy it while I can and leave the future to the future.
I am now going to indulge my sensitive side and watch the beautiful Richard E. Grant in Jack &amp; Sarah, and maybe shed a little tear for it.

For my Irene."

"event","So, Irene stayed over last night. It was really really nice. There was a lot of holding, and talking, even a kiss.
Like I said we talked a lot, hopefully we got through to each other our feelings and such. Nothing much is going to happen as she knows I'm not into fast and furious relationships and she doesn't ant to hurt me by fucking me and running off. So it kinda leaves us with what I feel to be some of the better parts of a relationship without the, I guess, complications of things like sex or future.

It is very odd to me that Irene is almost without exception, the opposite of what I look for in a woman. I value celibacy, willpower, rationality, sensibleness, and almost above all, a sense of longevity. I have never considered entering into a relationship that I didn't want to continue in for the rest of my left.
It is almost as if karma has sent Irene to me to make me realise that so much in this life is temporary, and if I have a chance at happiness, no matter how fleeting it might be, that I should take it. It is almost as if all the normal relationship stuff has been distilled and filtered and I'm left with the wonderfully wholesome, relaxed, gentle, and caring bits. With Irene, there are no worries about if abject honesty will cause friction, no hassle as to where the hole thing is going, and no actual need to make sure the other party is pleased and content.

Still, I'm back to Leicester in a little over two weeks and Irene is back off to Spain in a little under a month. I guess that is what detracts from so many of the problems normally associated with me and relationships. I'm just going to enjoy this one as it comes...

Wish me luck."

"event","So, I meant to update a while back on the goings-on over the weekend I went home. But I couldn't be arsed.
So there.

I did, however, think lots about it and had some lovely flowery similes and metaphors to use in the post, but I forget them.
So there.

I do remember how nice it was to go back to Leicester and see green things once again. Luton has taken the final step and concreted over the last piece of communal greenery in the town centre.

I finished my last piece of assignment work, and did a presentation in liu of a final exam for robotics as the lecturer is a lazy git.

Also, lately, I've been totally getting my Cure love on again. Even when Jocelyn deceides to run into my room and try to chastise me for listening to 'chav music' when I do. That boy is a freak, especially when you realise he doesn't listen to anything that hasn't been in the top 20 in the last few years, and he has the gall to say that I listen to chav music. Still, only a few more weeks of this and I'm done with him for good.

In other news, Irene and I have been getting along quite famously over the last few weeks. Other than her exams, she's been over to mine or I've been at hers every day pretty much. It's a little odd as she's pretty much completely diametrically opposed to everything I always thought I wanted in a woman. She's willful, reckless, a heavy smoker. We have such dissimilar interest in pretty much everything. She's a marketing student, very very scocialble with everyone. She's a hard metal head, and goes way way over the top.
It's also these vary traits that seem to draw me to her, she's open, honest, invigorating. She has so much energy I get a kind of happy tiredness just watching her rock out to System Of A Down or Nine Inch Nails.
But then she's heading back off to Spain in a month, and then off to the States for a year to complete her studies, before coming back to Luton for 6 months to tie up loose ends and get her degree. It's almost as the decision has already been made for me, I can enjoy the companionship for the little time remaining, or we can step it up a gear, and be in the shortest relationship I've ever been in but have a bloody good time of it.

After all, everything is only temporary anyways, isn't it??"

I've come up to Nottingham for a weekend and I'm getting to spend soe quality time with <lj user=""damnedhalo""> and <lj user=""daughteroflight""> when she's not working. Oh yeah, she works at this <i>busy</i> little pub just down the raod fro this house and it does soe of the most amazing food I've tasted ina long while. Then again, the last bit of food I tasted before coming here was a garlic & chilli chicken curry sandwich so I can't really say anything.

Got soe other stuff I was gonna say, but i can't remember now so that's probably a lot better for you lot. I'll be back into my routine on Tuesday hopefully so see you lots then if not efore.

Oh yeah, and typos are evauase the alcohol has reached my fingeroonies."

"event","Well, I got home from work on Saturday to find out internet connection out for the count. Now this usually pisses me off but I was absolutely livid as I was meant to be helping <lj user=""karaden""> out with her artificial neural network project. I called up the engineers and such but no-one was able to come  until this morning. So I missed the deadline to help her and I am thoroughly pissed off that I've spent nearly two years and a dissertation working on exactly this sort of stuff and not be able to help out (OK, so I wanted to be suave and all-knowing geek, but that's just a happy coincidence).

So, what does a geek do on a Sunday when they have no 'net access I hear you cry out. Well, it seems we get our arses into gear and clear up the hovel we've been living in for the past couple of months while we've been writing our dissertation. I managed to gather up well over a black bag of rubbish from my room, and clearing it all out made be realise that I, in fact, have a floor in my bedroom... I was surprised as you are now I can tell you. It's kinda great, I can move my chair around without crushing some vital piece of paper, or a cd that I need; I can even walk around barefoot (in my own room at least) without having to brush the crap off my feet when I get into bed... On the other hand, people can now walk into my room without breaking their necks on my intricately laid stepping stones.

Once all the work was done, I felt as if I should be truly decadent (one again, finishing my dissertation has made me treat myself well beyond that which I deserve) and so got a Indian take-out. Yummy scrummy in my tummy. I then realised that I was turning into <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/content/images/2005/05/12/brian_blessed_150_150x180.jpg"">Brian Blessed</a>, at least in a follicular sense, so proceeded to cut my hair, shave, and have a vigorous shower before climbing into my fresh clean bed and having a damn good sleep.

Oh it was lovely indeed. It was almost a shame that I had to wake up this morning to find the NTL guy and let him in. He checked out shizzle and it turned out hat some other engineer had once again overloaded our port on the local exchange and out line wasn't getting the signal quality it needed. I hate the fact the more bandwidth you have, for more sensitive to faults the line gets. Damn them all.

Anyways, got an assignment due in at the end of this week and the thoughtful lecturers decided that we can only use one piece of software to do it in and make sure that it's one that we can't get student licenses for. Joy.

Take care my homies."

"event","There will always be something terribly terribly odd, and maybe a little wonderful, about the time my father died.
This day two years ago was grey and oppressive, in some karmic touch of respect. Each anniversary since (yes I know it's only two, but this is irrational feeling and doesn't have to make sense) has been a beautiful and sunny day, given to joy and happiness, not just for me but for the people I see on streets, in cars, in pubs. They're all enjoying themselves, for themselves. The know nothing of my father, or me, or my sister. The sun shines on them and for them, just as it shines on my sister and I.

Things like this remind me that we should reap all the happiness while we can, my father certainly would have urged us to do so. Maybe that is why the world is so much more beautiful on this day.

Today I went in to uni for my practicals and lectures now I can. I spent time with friends in a pub garden, eating a sandwich of the biggest bread ever and drinking some cool, crisp cider in direct sunlight. Like I&nbsp; said, it's almost as if the universe takes this day to remind me how good things get sometimes, how everything becomes easy and free, if only for a while.

Heck, I even got back home to find an email from the proper network people at the uni telling me to come in for a possible real paid job as opposed to the peanuts the computing dept were offering me.

Today is a good day to live.

"event","Today has been a thoroughly fantastic day indeed!!

Last night I slept with bed sheets for the first time in weeks. I woke up early early this morning as it's what my body is used to and spent about two blissful hours drifting in and out of sleep knowing that I didn't have to get up at all that day. Ah it was fantastic. Yet get up I did, at the blissfully late time of 10am and I casually sauntered downstairs to be greeted by Stephen who was doing his headless chicken impersonation rather well in trying to get his dissertation finished and printed off. It was great to not rush my breakfast, take things uber easy for the morning.

When lunch decided to join me for the day, a few of us got together and hit Aroma for all it was worth. It seemed we lucked out and it was really quiet (well, half full is bloody quiet for Aroma at lunchtime). Spent a couple of hours eating which was glorious. After we had done with that, we met up with a load of other fellow uni -goers and went to a great little pub called the Brewery Tap. It's so the old people's pub in Luton and almost never gets the student types so it's right up my way. We spent the entire afternoon in the beer garden, about 15 of us, drinking and playing cards and getting bar snacks every now and again. I was absolutely fantastic.

I came home because the sun was beginning to get to me and my nose is beginning to peal. Overall though it has been a thoroughly thoroughly fantastic day, the only thing that could have made it better would be if a few of you guys could have been there too.

Peace brothers and sisters. Out."

"event","Hey peeps, I'm back in Luton now...
Well, I got back Wednesday evening, but my glorious friends decided it would be better for everyone concerned if they didn't do any of the chores or anything before they left. So now every room is a mess and there is a week and a half of rubbish in my back porch. I will destroy Jocelyn if he is ever brave enough to come back.

I also got back to find my boiler in pieces. Apparently it had been leaking and our landlady got her handyman to come and 'fix' it. So, this bloke being the bear cheapest she could find and a friend of the landlady, fix obviously meant ""take it apart now, then bugger off for a week or so"". I sit here without boiler, without heating, without hot water, without being able to wash my clothes from the trip, and with a dissertation to finish in about a month.
Not happy. Not happy one bit.

Which is a damn shame since the trip was so freaking fun. Warsaw is a run-down hole with some fantastic ex-soviet themes and the freakiest, but oddly useable, public transport system I've ever been on.

Irene was, as ever, the unstoppable torrent of ""let's do stuff"". I don't know how such a teensy person dregs up so much energy but she had the rest of us collapsing about halfway through the week. Oh, and I learn all the Polish I'm ever going to need: kawa (kah-vah) is coffee, piwo (pee-voh) for beer, and kourwa (khour-vah) means whore. I think you'll agree, that gets me pretty much anything I could possibly need.

We all took masses and masses of photos, Irene and Matt made a PowerPoint slide show fro them, but it's currently weighing in at about 150Mb, so we're gonna see what we can do to slim it down a touch. We took at least 100 photos just of the cemetery we visited (10km of headstones no younger than 1980, going back into 1800s) which were utterly fantastic.

Anyways, more specifics to come later, I have work to do.

Laters peeps."

"event","Well hallu from not-so-sunny Poland people!!

We're all having a rather fan-dabbie-dosie time of it here and doing a lot of stuff!!
I'm currently hanging out in the labs of the Polish and Japanese Institute of Technology and leeching internet from Matt's account. This is the first time since Wednesday evening I've had any sort of internet and I'm freaking loving it. Oh yes, big time styleee.

We arrived in good time on the flight and had a rather uneventful and 'exciting' ride of a segmented bus from the airport to the hotel. The hotel is a bit odd and halfway between a hotel and flats, we each have our own bathroom and hall but share a kitchen with only an electric hob and no oven. Due to this we have eaten out a <i>lot</i> and so far have been able to steer well clear of anything recognisable... I've had the delight of eating pirogi, bigos, something small and squishy and salty (no laughing at the back there), and something else that was mainly turkey. Oh and kebabs 'of fire' that were really rather tame and not particularly hot at all. I was most disappointed.

Irene found a coat, a somewhat well-cut coat, but still just a coat. It costs something along the lines of 3,300 zloty, which marks to over 845 euros or 590 pounds (sorry for currency names, but these keyboards don't have the symbols in the places I can find them). Ouch... She's been going absolutely mental over it for a few days now and her 'rents finally caved in and told her to buy it. Wow. I mean, even I don't spend that kind of money on one item... Before you say anything the computer is made of many items none of which cost that much on their own.

We've been spending a lot of time bumming around the Warsaw old town district and around a large building in the centre of the new town called the palace of culture. Since it sounds vaguely like something from 1983 (think Ministry of Peace), I haven't yet plucked up the courage to enter lest any culture I still have is torn from my soul and stored in the building for processing. Still, I think we are going to head to the top of it at some later point to look out and observe Warsaw from a new point of view. Then, perhaps, we are going to watch Ice Age 2 in the same building, oh the irony!!

Right, for all those interested, there will be some sort of power point slideshow being made of our trip here with many many photographs that I will put up once it is complete. I'll also give a go of converting it for the better of you out there who don't sully their computers with foul software from the vile belly of Redmond.

Anyways, I'm going to kick back now and hit up some wikkid bad AI routines with this class.

Peace, out!"

"event","Today has been interesting, got up late, handed in an assignment and met up with Esme, with whom I had a Pizza Hut buffet for lunch.

Then we went underwear shopping. I asked if we were after underwear to wear or underwear to seduce, and it turns out we were in full seduction mode...

So, with my eye in full queer mode, the hunt begins. I picked out a fantastic black bra with hot pink ribbon trim along the top edge and matching thong. It took me a while to convince her that the pink would work since it's such a small but feminine detail, but I at least got her trying them on.

When we went to the dressing room, a really scary, yet tiny, assistant person basically physically blocked me from going into the changing room after her to give my opinion on each set. Even so, the set I chose was one of those bought since she said it looked fantastic. Damn I'm good...

Then we headed to Costas for coffee and cookies and to natter about relationships and the like. We talked about how lucky Esme's bloke in Sweden is going to be for the week she's going home, about how odd my past relationships have been, and how I'm going to go about seducing <lj user=""karaden""> ;-) (In case you're wondering, we settled on talking DC Comics at her until she just gives in...)

We tried M&amp;S but were woefully depressed by the selection and even considered buying some of the granny pants, embroidering ""Fuck me in the ass"" on the back and sneaking them back into the stock...

Then we hit Ann Summers and picked up a fantastic little black PVC bodice with fantastic purple ribbon edging and lace-ups, with a hipster skirt it is going to knock that lucky bloke out of this world. And because she needed it, she also picked up a small, subtle travel vibe with a nice little case too. We decided against the subtlety of getting some 'Pussy Rub' cream and crotchless panties...

After that, we went our separate ways.

These are all the actions of an incredibly heterosexual guy right??

Right??"

"event","First off, apologies to those who tried to contact me yesterday. I had virtually no signal all the way home, and the train was delayed (thankfully only on the way back), so by the time I got home I just wanted to crash, and I pretty much did. It was odd vegging out in front of the TV still in my suit, but you know me, I managed all the same...
First just let me say that the underground is as easy as piss to navigate... If you know where you're going beforehand... The maps are broken down to the immediate lines and their connections when you're actually at the station as to not over-complicate things. The one thing that did confuse me is that the <i>underground</i> part of Farringdom station is higher than the normal train line platform. I forgave this transgression from my expectations, as the train rapidly descended into the bowls of London upon leaving the station.
I got to the place of interview with about half an hour to spare so I kicked back, sat in an outside bistro for a while supping a frothy cappuccino and watching the Londoners go about their business. It was very classy, unfortuantly it was also in the East End so I had my hand in my pocket and on my wallet at all times ;-)
When the appropriate time rolled around (about 10 minutes before the interview was scheduled) I walked into the rather nondescript building and to the rather scary men on reception. Only it wasn't reception but a main security desk. To get even to the receptions I had to be escorted through vertical cylindrical doors (think of any Sci-Fi film with 'decontamination' doorways and you'll get the idea) and in the elevator that would only work with swipe cards or manual code entry... Very swish...
Well, with me suitably impressed with the geeky decor (OK, so maybe a lift can't be considered decor but it <i>was</i> geeky) they then stunned me with the visitors waiting area, all black leather and red carpet. Most sexy. Then I met my interviewer, Sharon Keet, who came in a t-shirt, cardigan, jeans, and trainers making me feel woefully overdressed but a little bit better for the fact I won't have to be a shirt-and-tie worker if I get the job.
So, finally, the interview itself. Very interesting really... It's a big company which is expanding since it was recently bought out by BSkyB so there were a lot of positions available on the team I was being interviewed for. It was interesting because that made this part a lot more like a skills assessment than an interview for a particular job, but the jobs being described to me were a lot more defined and particular than any of my previous jobs. Anyways, the one that most appealed to me was one of messing around with the brand new kit to see what its strengths and weaknesses are to gauge where it would be best put in the future market for maybe the next 5-7 years. Basically, play with toys and tell everyone what it's good for. Just my sort of thing really :-D
I hope I made a good impression, there was plenty of smiles and murmurs of (I hope) being impressed from the interviewer and even a quick foray into the great Linux vs. FreeBSD debate which raised more than a smile on a couple of occasions. All in all it lasted a little over an hour and was all one-on-one stuff. I was told that the next interview would be again with the same woman but also a member of the team would join us and quiz me more technically and specifically to the job I would then be applying for.
So now I'm just working on my new project until I get a call or an email asking me back for a second interview, or not of course...

Still, here's hoping :-)"

I just had my first meeting with my new supervisor and bloody hell it's different...
After less than 30 mintes, I have far more information and direction than after 3 bloody months of being under my old supervisor. I'm am almost 'squee' happy... Almost...
Anyways, tomorrow I'm at uni from 9am to 1pm so I have to wear my bloody suit all day, I hope it's not going to be a problem going for the interview...

I'm back in Leicester now, heading out to sunny sunny Florida on Monday morning and I can't even fucking wait. I'm beyond stoked!!
I reckon I've got everything I need and sorted it all out. I leave 11:30am from Gatwick and don't have to bother changeing or any bollocks like that because I have absolutly the best girlfriend in the world ever. I don't get back until 7:35am on 7th Jan. I may need to just get the train back from Gatwick to Luton as it may well be too early for my 'rents to pick me up.
I've been given a few new things to think about but I'm gonna talk to April before making them public. It's nothing bad, quite the opposite in fact, just something I need to give serious thought to. Oh, and I need to contact another person about that now... Joy joy joy joy.
My dissertation has been steadily getting worse and worse and my ass is good and loose from all the fucking over I'm getting right now. Still no topic, still no product, still no project. The first part is due in in less than 5 weeks and I don't even have a fucking topic I can blag...

But hey, this uni has done nothing but screw me over for a while now. Nothing new here,

If anyone wants to know where I've been and what I've been up to, feel free to ask!!

"event","Well fuck it and fuck it hard.
After getting completely fucked over on my dissertation title over the summer, I am now being right-royally fucked over in being able to change it now... Basically, the head of department was meant to be my special supervisor due to my working on the network isn't anything to do with my actual course title (AI &amp; Robotics). For a small assignment at the end of last academic year, we were meant&nbsp; to write about a few projects we could possibly due for our dissertations so I did my assignment on the networking project.
Come the start of writing projects and I find out that because my assignment wasn't anything to do with my course title, I was assigned a random supervisor. A shit one at that. After one meeting I knew this is not the guy I want to work with for the next year in what is the most important part of my degree. So I talk to a couple of my lecturers and one has a project that he's been wanting to assign to someone for a few years now and we agreed that not only do I have the skills and abilities, but it's also something I'll enjoy doing. So I make the request to change and get told that since we're now in week 6, no changes can be made without the head of deptartment's permission. Since he was one who helped me get this fucked up I would have thought that he'd do this little favour for me now.
Well suspense fans, I asked him. You want to know his reply?? Cause you do :-

""I am afraid I cannot intervene on the matter.""

That's all folks. That's how much I get for spending my summer helping out the uni. Fuck them if they think I'm going to work for them once I've completed my degree. Fuck it all.

In other news, LiveJournal has been making changes. Stop it. Also, I no longer have a piad account nor the money to have a paid account, I might get paid at the end of this. Who know with this fucking uni??"

"event","It's been a pretty long time since I updated so I suppose it's time to bore you all with the complete lack of excitement that is my ongoing life.

First off, a while back there was a big blow-up between me, Cate, &amp; April. Basically over peoples misinterpretations other what they wrote. Everyone said hurtful things, me because I was angry at the pair of them, April because she thought Cate was trying to come between me and her, Cate because April used some words that she knew Cate didn't like specifically to get a reaction.
Now, Cate and I have made up, April is over the whole episode and can't see why Cate insists on holding such a grudge even if it means me not being welcome in her house when I'm with April. Which should make next Christmas an awful lot of fun.

Next, I've finally got around to upgrading one of my servers (or is currently in the process of), including a custom kernel with a crap load of hard drives in it for some half-decent file storage and removal of the stupid Windows domain I made just to see if I could (I can). Now I just have to hope that the fresh format and new kernel speed things up a little and people can actually use the damn server...
Also, I have a willing parts donation from a friend to set up a full-on MythTV box, basically a Do-It-Yourself TiVo. Unfortunately, the TV card isn't anything more than a raw frame-grabber so the CPU is going to have to be doing an awful lot of work encoding and decoding the stream, and with only one TV card there will be no funky picture-in-picture or record-and-watching two different channels. Ah well, we learn to make do ;-)

Lastly, I'm all alone now. Stephen has gone off to Yorkshire as his mum says he could get a job easier up there, Joce left almost at the beginning of the holidays (and cancelled his share of the internet bill without telling me so I'm going to be incredibly cross with him when he gets back), Matti obviously left for Finland quite a while ago and even James (who is temporarily staying here over the summer) has buggered off to Spain. So, that's it, me here alone for ages now. I'm going to thoroughly clean the house so I can enjoy the feeling of living in a clean house at least for the week.

Last weekend I went to a friend's wedding reception, wearing a tuxedo-printed t-shirt April bought for me. The happy couple absolutely adored it so I wasn't thrown out :-D We also spent quite a lot of time before the reception with Darren and Amy at a country fair in London. It was great fun but blisteringly hot and it seems, after the burn and the peeling, I seem to be left with a semblance of colour in my skin. It's awfully creepy, though not as creepy as the wonderful combination of medium-sweet cider and freshly-cooked Chinese made for lunch at said fair. Fantastic.

So that's it really. Oh, and I had to replace the battery in the phone Cate gave me because it would die all the time even though the icon showed it as being fully charged.

Peace. Out."

"event","Stuff has been happening.
Work, things are generally good. The boss forgot an entire closet of switches (for the computing staff of all people!!) but since we specced beyond our current needs, we'll have enough stock to kludge one together :-S
Oh, and due to the immense amount of work I've put in to this project they are now asking me to keep a time sheet and are going to press their bosses for some sort of pay.
Can we say yay??
We can, but best not to yet, they are just looking in to it and couldn't promise anything of cause, but hell, it's something to look up to.

On a more personal note, I'm very very far down the line in considering and planning emigration to Canada with April. Sheep hit upon the idea that since she's already in the states, she could head straight to Canada and set up shop there as soon as she finishes her degree. Then, when she's settled, I quit whatever job I have and head over there and get things going. It means she only has to emigrate once, and we get to start our life together a little earlier (her 2 years of uni left plus whatever time she needs to get settled somewhere in Canada as opposed to her 2 years of uni, a year or 5 here, then going off to Canada).
This can only happen if I'm allowed to pay off my student loan from another country.
It also means that we'd pretty much have to get married in Canada and then hold a ceremony here in the UK for all our family.

Oh, and all hail the new iconage (original image found by <lj user=""wabit2003""> and posted in her jornal, into-icon-making-magic by <lj user=""thinking_thing"">)..."

"event","Well, I've just packed her off, she's on the bus making her not-so-merry way down to Gatwick to catch her great metal flying beast to far away lands.

It was quite difficult, and not only because I had to wake up at 4:30am and hadn't had any breakfast...
Every moment I spend with her just seems like a proper moment, when I'm with her there is no being without her, and when I'm without her there is only waiting to be with her again.

Unfortunatly, I have a meeting at 11:30am today anbd still have some work to finish up for it, then I have what is most likly going to be a full day meeting tomorrow with the design consultant to make sure we havn't done anything overtly stupid.

Other than that, it's back to my normal daily grind, and a very lonely bed at the end of the day.

I love you so much sweetheart, see you soon."

"event","Well, I had a meeting today.
A 6 hour meeting.
With proper project leaders and network design consultants from Logicalis.
They kind of offered me a job.

Which was nice.

Basically, they said because I'm still in my third year, and they are based in Slough (ugh), they can't really get me to do part-time work or anything. So they basically said I really ought to get in contact with them when I'm near to the end. Gave me scribbled numbers on the back of a buisniess card and everything.

Anyways, April and I are getting on really really well, except for the heat making me not want any sexy sexy and her want it a lot. It's going to hurt when she leaves me, and it's going to be a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">long</span> time until I see her again...

But anyways, I'm not dead, just busy...

Love you all.

"event","Ok, so dad got me a car for hier for the week I'm in Leics with April, he said he hired it for pickup in the AM. I don't know if he fucked up, or the car rental company fucked up, or if their idea of AM is simple completly out of phase with my idea of AM.

It seems that their idea of AM is midday...

Which is odd, since one second after midday is surly the PM?? Maybe I really really misunderstood the whole concept when it was taught to me. Anyways, the only life I could have got today dropped me off at about 9:45am which I though was ample time to be in the AM but no, I'm fucked.

And to rub salt in the wound, do you know what I'm getting??

"event","Well, last night, my computer came very very close to blowing up.
In fact, it came so close the motherboard itself went into nagging nanny mode and turn my machine off and refused to turn it back on until the cpu had cooled itself down from the rather scary 80'C it was running at.
So I've had to buy a new, stupidly hardcore, cpu cooler tha uses heatpipes and all this shizzle in the hope that it will bring my cpu down into the 60'C range, but a 20'C difference either means there is something seriosly wrong with my current cooler or I use liquid nitrogen as a cooling mechanism.
Anyways, all this is putting my desktop out of action for a while, but thankfully my laptop is designed to run on flea power and therefore is a hell of a lot cooler. Even then the only thing i can play on it is Planescape Torment because anything ewer overheats the poor dear.

"event","Well, handed in my last assignment today, only 3 exams now and I've done the second year.
Um, yeeeehaaaa
or
something.
Right...

Aslo had my first network project meeting, got shown all the documents of layout, proposed stuff, and health and safty. All pretty normal crap.
Then came the good stuff...
The server rooms...
These beasts are the shiznit...
Halon fire suppression systems, entry cages, multiple UPSs as big as my wardrobe as well as backup generators, more fibre that you could shake a box of bran flakes at, the start of JANET, which is basicly an entry point and arm of the internet itself. With one well-placed finger I can put half of Luton out of reac of the internet. I have never <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ever</span> been so freaking tempted in my entire life. All that hardware at my fingertips really brought the bad side of geek out of me again... Hehehehehehe...
Anyways, it's going to be hard work, 7 day weeks and all that, but it's going to be an experience and no mistake. Fan-bloody-tastic!!"

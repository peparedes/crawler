"event","Well my freshman year of college drew to a conclusion today!  Just waiting on grades to be posted.  I think the really sad thing is the fact that I am going back to school Monday.  I decided to go to summer school to get some classes out of the way, what fun!  lol  It is really gonna suck but I hope it'll be worth it.  Try 3 hours of calculus a day.  Not cool!  Stupid compressed schedule.  What to do?  I thought it would be good if i focused on math this summer since that seems to be my porest subject!  I got a C- in it.  To those of you that go to High School in Virginia Beach that would be the equivelant to like a D on the 7 point grading scale.  Yeah thats how bad I am.  I was the same way in High School.  No big difference there.  Oh well I need my new grades.......Wish I could of done better in Math, would of fixed my grade problems. :-(  Oh well.  Still going for that 3.0 GPA so I can go to Japan.  I will let you know if I get it!

"event","Ok, today was reading day.  Whoever thought that one up needs to be shot.  Yesterday was the last day of Spring 2003 classes.  I suppose I should be happy, but I am not!  It ended way to quick, and I feel not even close to be being reading for Finals.  My firts of which is tomorrow.  Its the one that always makes me nervous.  The Japanese ORAL Final.  What FUN!  My Japanese knowledge probed by my teacher.  I guess its necessary, but I don't think so.  I am so nervous I don't know if I will be able to sleep tonight.  No matter how tired I am.  I need very good grades this semester.  Its a requirement if I want to study abroad in Japan soon.  God help me!  I am gonna fail!  

Well so I have to be out of this dorm by Next Thursday like at 10PM.  Too bad my last final is Next Thurday lasting until 6:45!  You would think they would give us more time.  And to make it worse its not a quick final, its my Kanji final!  So about now I am starting to get stressed out.  I think my largest break of time during the week would be during my Japanese Written Final ending around 11:30 AM Monday and my Macroeconomics Final on Wednesday at 7:00PM.  I am just glad i have alot of time to prepare for my KANJI FINAL!  Thats gonna also murder me.  Maybe I could fake my own death to avoid Finals all together.  I just feel a but overwhelmed thats all!  My Math teacher did a good thing.  I have like a low C in that class.  And she doesn't think the rule of if you miss a test your grade on the final will replace it is fair to the people who were there for every test.  So what she did is gave the people who were there for all the tests the same deal.  She looked up what the maximum # of tests missed was and if our final grade is higher than 1 or two of our tests our final grade replaces those.  She is the coolest teacher and she is damn hot too.  All these good things in one.  :-)  So I am a happy camper if I can pull of a high grade on that final!  Neways thats on Friday and that is all I am gonna study for after the Japanese Oral Exam.  Then right after my Math one I will have to study for the Japanese Written Final.  Anyways I am looking at a rough week!  Wish me luck!

"event","Damn Allergies always on me this time of year and I thought I was outgrowing them.  Guess I was wrong.  I felt so sick I had to skip Kendo last night so the last class is coming up this Tuesday and it is also the day of the final.  I think I might have a stressful Tuesday.  Have my Macroeconomics test tonight.  Wish me luck!  Don't know if I got any of the Take Home Test correct, all I can do is hope.  I think I did it right, atleast I hope.  But, Japanese class was interesting this morning, it all flew over my head.  I have also made plans with the ODU Study Abroad Office for a year long study abroad in Japan starting Fall 2004.  Should be fun.  I hope I get in, I hear alot of people want to go next year, but there might only be a couple spots open to go.  Also you need atleast a 3.0 to be accepted to Kansai Gaidai University.  So I am a bit worried.  
	I had this whole expectation of the Study Abroad programs at James Madison University would be so much better, but I think I was wrong.  It appears to me that JMU's Study Abroad Program is inferior to ODU's.  This confuses me, but I have heard that ODU is like a top school for Internation Studies, which also confuses me.  How could such a crappy school be so good?  Neways, I have my sites set and I know what I want to do which might force me to stay here at ODU.  Well this is whats on my mind.  Hope you had fun.

"event","I got the 3 pack of the 3 newly released Studio Ghibli movies which were KiKi's Delivery Service, Castle in the Sky, and Spirited Away.  Ok, first off never watch the English dubbing of Spirited Away.  The voices themselves are not bad, but the actual translation is.  The movie in English had poor transition in the language.  Neways I havn't really seen all of Kiki's Delivery Service from the past so thats why i wanted it plus its a miyazaki hit.  Havn't watched that one all the way, but i can't decide out of the movies which is my favorite.  So far its a deadlock between Spirited Away and Castle in the Sky, and since i just recently saw the english dubb of Spirited Away I am leaning more towards Castle in the Sky.  Both Very Good.  
	My allergies have been killing me lately so I am feeling not so good, but fit enough to do everything in my normal life.  So I am going to go give Platelets tonight at the American Red Cross.  School is almost over.  I think my last day is May 8th.  Its kind of scary.  So close to the end and it feels like just the beginning.  And for those of you confused by the Japanese in my current music its the Opening Music to FF7.    Why I am writing don't ask me.

"event","Well I am back from Kendo now.  You know I wish it to end when I am there, but when I got back to my dorm, I wish I was still there.  How weird.  Theres a Martial Arts Clinic this weekend that sensei wants me to go to.  Don't know if I will go, my friends are planning something this weekend so I gotta get up with them, and see whats going on.  I kinda want to go, its 5 hours str8 Kendo.  I think I would die, but I am torn in between going and not.  What to do, what to do.  My uniform shrunk down.  Very happy about that!  
Well during Kendo I think I learned my lesson.  Didn't block correctly and got nailed in the head by my own Shinai from the impact.  HW sucks.  And I got plenty of it.  Don't know how I let myself get so behind.  So.......I can't remember much of what happened today.  I think that blow to the head did that.  So not much to recap on what happened.

Neways, just got back from one of the films featured at the ODU Film Festival titled ""My Father, The Genious"".  It was a documentary a daughter made about her father.  You would think normally this would be boring as hell......but this guy was very outspoken and I am very surprised I have never heard of him before.  Probably something not many people would be interested in, but he was a Architect, a VERY outspoken architect who wasn't going the same way as everyone else.  The director explored every part of his life, and i do mean EVERY!  Like I believe I said before the director was his daughter.....uhh..I'll finish this later"

In any case I am awake now, went to Japanese class today, turned in my Japanese compositon titled &#31169;&#12398;&#23478;&#26063;.  Then i went to Precalc which was my last class of the day since all Communication classes are cancelled for the Movie Festival.  Yeah it sounds good there, but we gotta right a paper on the movies we see, and we have to atleast see 3.  So you tell me which one is better.  So no 3 o'clock Public Speaking.  I really can't decide which is better.  They had chicken tender and waffle fries for lunch, i think that is their best dish.  How sad........  Neways, my friend is in town from Florida so I am thinking about going to see him.  He comes in without telling anyone he's coming.  So its no annoying how he gets mad at you cause he expects you to drop your entire schedule to make room for him.  And my reply is, ""Maybe if you told me in advance you were coming!""  There is alot more i could say, but i think you got my point.  I know how many time si have said this, but i think i am gonna try and update this every day from now on.  If I don't you can just wait for me to post again.  hehe  So I am in my dorm room and my room mate is asleep like always.  He sleeps til like 3PM everyday!  I don't understand how anyone can sleep that much, I mean I thought i had the record on sleep!  Oh and BTW, i am kinda upset.  I got a letter from JMU telling me i was waitlisted.  So it just kinda made my life a little more complicated with deadlines for ODU and things like that.  Cause trust me if i get into JMU I am going.  But I do feel I might be going up in the world.  Last year I was just plain out denied and this year I am waitlisted.  If I don't get in, maybe next year I will be accepted.  Well I better get in, cause if I don't I will be stuck @ ODU!  Well I don't know.  Just depends where I am credit wise if I decided to apply again.  Well I am probably hurting your poor eyes so I might just write more til they bleed!  Naw, I wouldn't do that to you.

"event","Well I decided that I am going to start writing in this journal again.  I told someone about it and they were like ""Something I don't need to hear.""  So that peaked my interest.  

Well my day today was I guess ok.  I woke up at 10:30 AM to get ready for Japanese Class.  Fun time as usual, had a pop test!  FUN!  I screwed up with my particles again!  They switch around so easily, I think the teachers are just screwing with me.  Neways right after Regodan-san and I ran over to Webb Center and got Chick-fil-A.  The usual Rogers cafeteria food seemed a bit, non appetizing like always today, and I felt I owed it to myself so that I am ready for my Kanji Midterm at 3:00.  So I spent the rest of the time in between studying.  And when I got there I failed!  Well atleast I think I did.  I completed the sucker to the best of my ability, hope its ""A"" material.  *laugh  
	So after that I got depressed.  A friend and I went to go see ""The Recruit"" at MacArthur Centur Regal Cinemas.  Lets see......Theater 14 at 7:40PM.  HAHA.  LOL, I'm just tired.  Talk about getting your life fucked over.  It all happened in that movie.  So I came back to Gresham, bought some gum at the C-Store and am pleasantly chewing it as we speak.  Err...as I speak.  Anyways I have another midterm on Friday, my real Japanese midterm and then freedom for a week for Spring Break.  I want to go to Florida dammit!
Was looking for someone going, but no such luck, so I think I am just gonna hang out with some friends, just to worry about the midterms after break.  How evil is that?!  
	BTW, I did apply to JMU before the deadline so I am anxiously awaiting that.  LOL.  You will be able to tell if i got in without me having to tell you.  I will be depressed for about a week, good thing I have tons of sleeping pills stashed away!  j/k  But I am ready to get out of this hell hole called Old Dominion University.

					The Rainbow Bridge

	There is a bridge connecting heaven and earth.  It is called the Rainbow Bridge because of its many colors.  Just this side of the Rainbow Bridge there is a land of meadows, hill, and valleys with lush green grass.
	When a beloved pet dies, the per goes to this place.  There is always food and water and warm spring weather.  The old and frail animals are young again.  Those who are maimed are made whole again.  They play all day with each other.
	There is only one thing missing.  They are not with their special person who loved them on Earth.  So, each day they run and play until the day comes when one suddently stops playing and looks up!  The nose twitches!  The ears are up! The eyes are staring!  And this one runs from the group!
	You have been seen, and when you and your special friend meet, you take him or her into your arms and embrace.  Your face is kissed again and again and again, and you look once more into the eyes of your trusting pet.
	Then you cross the Rainbow Bridge together, never again separated.

Its funny when you see a loved one die you are partially no longer afraid of death.  I do not really have a fear of death right now.  
	Thanks to those of you that responded to my last post showing your support.  It really does help.  You are my true friends.  
	I am back at school now ready for a two day week.  Fall Break combined with one day of mourning.

"event","I have had the crummiest weekend ever!  Sorry about the lack of updates.  I don't know what to say.  I thought this weekend would be awesome.  Hang out with my friends and have fun, it was a 4 day weekend.  The first break of college in which they call Fall Break.  I ended up working the first two days str8.  But that isn't the kicker.  The night of the second day I got into a physical fight with my friend.  He got kicked out of the military and is staying with us.  And you know the saying, never live with your best friend.  I learned this to be true.  If it wasn't for me hw could of gotten thrown out of my house immediately by my parents.
Anyways Sunday night was the first time I was actually able to get some sleep.  In the early morning I kept being awoken by my dog wimpering downstairs.  I guess you could say I have the ears of a mother who could hear their baby crying from the next room.  I mean its not like she was at the base of the stairs wimpering.  She was down on the other side of the house.  My instincts told me to get up and check it out, but the other side of me told myself to go back to sleep because I was wiped.  So I did.  Anyways my mom was obviousely already awake.  BIG MISTAKE!  My mother everntually comes upstairs to wake me up and tell me that we have to take Tara (my dog) to the vet.  Apparently she is having trouble walking.  She had done something to her right back leg.  This I had no idea of how bad it was til we got from the vet.  Anyways we carried her out and borrowed the neighbors car to take her.  It was one of those 4 wheel drive things with a big area for storage in the back so it made it easier to transport her.  Well what I forgot to mention was that our own vet wouldn't even take her!  They were like we don't have an opening til wednesday, but we can hold her in out kennel til wednesday or until an opening comes available.  I mean where is your vet when you need them!  This was an emergency!  MY DOG CAN NOT WALK!  We ended up getting an appointment at a place about 20 minutes away.  Well the vet had a stretcher they used to get her hour of the car with.  So it was much easier once we got her there.  They gave her a shot of cortozone to help her with the pain and inflamation and it was our only option other than surgery.  Well we were supposed to see if this worked.  We would either see a difference that night or the next morning.  Well there was a difference, but she still could not walk on that leg.  She couldn't stand to use the restroom or walk.  All day and night she couldn't help but use the bathroom on herself.  We put a layer of plastic underneath the blanket she was on so the urine and stuff would not damage the carpet more than it had already.  So my mom ended up staying up with her all night.  I wish I was down there with her, but I would of only complicated things more.  It was something I would of done, sleep on the floor next to her in a sleepign bag.  I love her for being their with Tara. Well my mum never got any sleep all night as Tara was whining all night.  Well the next morning, this being today Tuesday the 15th of 2002, my mother decided to put her to sleep.  I could not believe it.  I will tell you I was upset.  The one thign that got me was though it was like she knew it was gonna happen.  I was feeding her meaty bones the rest fo the day and during the trip to the vet.  I was in the back with her, just petting her, trying to make her feel comfortable.  When the nurses came out with the stretcher, like I said she knew what was happening and she was scared.  Right when she saw the nurses she urinated on herself.  Almost on my foot, but I wouldn't of minded.  This dog meant so much to me.  She was born in the Spring of 1990 and I was like 5 or 6 when she was born.  I saw her born.  We grew up together and I think I was either a son or father to her.  She protected me when I was younger.  When they finally got her into the room she had lost pretty much any hope and she just looked so sad.  I so much wanted to say don't do it. Infact I would of taken off school to take care of her, but my parents wouldn't of allowed it and they owuld of had the procedure done anyways so I could of done nothing.  I just wanted to make her as comfortable as possible.  When the doctor started to put the tourniquette on I was nose to forhead with her.  I'm sorry this is taking me a little while to say.  I'm starting to cry while writing this.  You know if you can't imagine what I am saying, our forheads touched as did our noses.  They gave her a very strong anesthetic.  It was very disturbing how fast acting it was.  Before the doctor could get more than half of it in, she took her last breath, and what bothered me the most was her tomgue was hanging out her mouth.  Last thankgiving we lost a cat unexpectedly, and when my mum found her her tongue was hanging out of her mouth and I guess I suddenly found a relationship.  We have lost two animals within a year.  I really could not leave her once it was over.  I just kept hugging and kissing her.  She was much more than a dog, she was a family member, that mattered.  Its to hard to look at the things that were hers and the habits we had that revolved around her.  I would do anything to get her back.  Its like hell I grew up with this dog, I barely have a memory of what its like to be without her.  It was one of the hardest things that I have ever done in my life.  She lived a very long life for a big dog.  I mean she almost hit a 100 in dog years.   We keft the room finally and I had to go back in.  I missed her already.  I loved her so much.  I miss that dog more than anything.  I don't know what I am gonna do without her.  I decided not to attend school tomorrow.  I am just too upset.  It did in someway have good timing since it was on my break and I was there to say goodbye to her, instead of me being at school and hearing about it later.  We are getting her cremated and tomorrow morning we pick her up.  I have been trying to look for a good picture to put on the urn.  But, havn't found a good one yet.  My god when it was over, I couldn not breath.  Thats how hard I was crying.  I miss her so much.  So all I have left now is cat that really isn't mine anymore.  She pretty much became my moms when I left for school since I was gone for such a long time.  I am gonna try and include a photo of my cat and my dog together.  Right now I think I am about to fall apart.  So I suppose I can safely say this was the worst weekend of my life, so far.  A friendshop almost broken up, along with a deceased loved one.

It sucked, its a very small class so its very hard to sneak in.  Got tons of HW, but I need to hang out with some friends.  I am so bored right now.  I need help!  Oh yay!  Toonami just started.  Been awhile since I watched that, does Hamtaro still come on at 4?  Guess I'll find out in a sec huh?  Had to use my evil &#12426;&#12423;&#12362;&#12402;&#12365;&#12288;powers.  That cabit gives me the ability to make people fail in UT.  I was like you will not defeat ZAN!  MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  Held my Ryo-oh-ki idol infront of him.  Gots you!  Me and my l33t powers.  Only when I started to let up did he win.  So dinner just started right now, thinking about skipping it, have class at 5:45 and some HW.  don't know what to do.  I can turn it in later, but I don't know if I want to.  Oh well.  I am a raving lunatic she says.  uhh.......wonder where that came from.  I am gonna have to pick a day to go see my friend Shae.  Don't know when, just so busy.  It sucks so much.  School is a full time job, especially when you have a part time job already.  Who knows how it will turn out.  I think I am doing all right!  Chris, you and your Arizona grades.  I got a C on my Historical Geology Test.  WHO WOULD OF EVER FUCKING THOUGHT A ""70"" WOULD BE A C!  I hate this.  I think it should be a D.  It throws me off so much.  Evil college.  Evil grades.  Oh wells, me has updates this journal a little.  I will make sure to write back laterz."

you are a <b>DREAMER</b> (SIAF)--reserved and imaginative.  You are

I have homework due in my &#26085;&#26412;&#35486; class.  So I am sitting here watching Death & Rebirth.  Its great.  Is it just me or did my font change?  I have no idea why it happened.  Oh well.  I took a Sega CD I picked up at EB Gameworld cause it was missing some parts.  It sucks cause it was a rare find.  I need to find another.  I feel so much better having an actual TV in my room.  Makes me feel more at home if you know what I mean.  We had some kind of party downstairs tonight.  Pretty much just games and cake.  I just sat around and played Yahtzee all night.  Not much else.  What we need are some DDR pads and a big screen TV.  That would of been a party!

Definetly more relaxed atmosphere.  It sucks because you actually have to pay for your education.  LOL. Well I am now home after my first week.  Took my computer back home and bought a 19 inch TV and DVD Player for my dorm room.  This time my checks were accepted!  WHOOT!  

Went and saw my friend and he just had to go and piss me off.  Went to see him with another friend and when we were about to leave the friend that came with me said see ya next weekend and you'll probably see Keitaro before you see me.  And he said ""Yeah if I'm unlucky.""  I just swallowed it and kicked his door and left.  Well I kicked his door after I left.  You know from the outside.  So I am a bit upset about that.  I mean I have taken his crap for awhile and this one just set me over the line.  Hope you people can understand.  RIght now I do not want to see him.  Jerk.  Anyways so I am home hanging out with friends.  Except you know who.  Having a good time so far. 

Back on the subject of school, my geology teacher rocks.  So far he has let us out early twice out of three times.  Japanese is fun as long as you are there on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Different teacher......  Uhh......Math sux, another personality conflict with the teacher.  And that university orientation class is ok I GUESS!  Only once a week.  YAY! :-)  hehe.  

Oh btw, I was shy at first, but now I am starting to get to know the peeps in my dorm.  Its great.  I feel more at home there and they are jealous that I get to come home and have some real food on the weekends.  hehe, suckers!  lol.  Its just another advantage of going to school so close to home, but it would be a nightmare to commute everyday.  Figuring things are getting better everyday.  Hopefully I will get to know everyone on the I-Hall very soon.  

The College Experience is awesome, but having to go to class everyday sucks!  Like I said before ""IT SUX!""  I also worked Alicia Keys on Friday night at the Amphitheater.  I had already missed alot of shows cause of school.  AND GET THIS!  I was told to come in to work on Thursday night at Blockbuster, and then they told me they didn't need me cause they thought I wasn't coming in!  They had already had someone to replace me.  Now here I am having already driven the 45 minutes from ODU to home and I find out from my Dad they don't need me.  I called them pissed.  So there went 90 minutes from my day I can't get back.  The whole thing pissed me off.  Stupid management.  Oh well....I still get free movies.  

I really hope I am not boring you all with my constant talking.  I think there are only two people who read this neways.  You two know who you are.  LOL

See ya guys later (and those of you that stumbled on),

Going to Ocean Lakes for an hour and a half and then having 50 minute classes and my geology class ended early.  Thats whats great about college, atleast I think.  Went home on Saturday night......needed to sleep in my own bed and hung out with some of my friends.  Felt better, but then I started to become a bit paranoid of all the stuff I left at my dorm.

Arggh, ODU!  Its actually my first time being away from home for a very long time.  I think I wish ODU was closer so I could drive to school.  :-)  But, I am here now.  Got a room mate from Tanzania!  He plays Rugby, what an offset to my computer personality!  Its gonna be a very interesting semester.  
   So I got up this morning.  Packed.  It was a very stressful morning as I got very little sleep and it was stressful anyways because of what was happening.  So in essence. just alot of arguing.  Well we finally got out here about 3pm........my roommate had already been here for like 5 days.  Neways, had to toally rearrange the room to work everything.  I brought too much stuff.  I never thought that would be possible.  But me, the spoiled brat only child has too much stuff.  What a surprise!  So it took awhile to get everything arranged, my roommate came in a couple of times.  Very interesting fellow.  Speaks with a british accent.  Its great.  He brought all the stuff that I thought he wouldn't bring.  I mean they told us to get in contact with each other before we move in, but I couldn't do much.  All I had was a city.  No Phone #, address, or country.  The only reason I found out it was Tanzania was because I searched in the World Book Atlas!  But it doesn't seem so bad.  After me moved in, my parents took me out to eat.  Ruby Tuesday.  Very interesting food, out of all the restaurants like that I will still always prefer Applebee's.  Bourbon Street Steak!  Well so I came back, saw some friends that I knew, hung out, and then came back. I think I may go out again.  See ya around.

Oh well......the amphitheater was fun.  Some band members from Van Halen......Sammy Hagar, and David.......something!  Oh well the music was good....got to listen to some of it as I was relieving people.  Got to drive the golf cart today.  I must of taken like 3 people.  LOL A big change from Luther in which I couldn't even stop.  I mean it took me 15 trips at the end of the night at Luther to get the people out.  Crazy night that one was especially with the weather.  At the end of the night I helped out my old clan of Red Shirts clean up the front plaza.  Most of you have no idea what I am talking about and its probably better that way.

The driver got pissed cause she can't control her jetski that well.  Oh well she also got over it quickly.  Probably going with them to Ocean Breeze on Thurday.  neways......my hands are all raw from holding on for dear life!  Its crazy hitting a wave at that speed....you fly in the air!  Now I'm home got the salt and crap off me from the water.....but I will always say that I can never live anywhere far from the ocean.  For me it is just comforting to know that the water is there.  I felt so at home in Hawaii when I was there in April.  It just felt better.....hard to explain.  Just the thought of living somewhere in the middle of the country knowing that 1,000 miles in either direction you will never hit any kind of ocean or large body of water.  What kind of way to live is that?  I realized today that the ocean is in my blood and I would probably die if I was far from it.
	I hope the whole Busch Gardens thing will be fixed.  I know now that I will not be going with my friends, but I think I am gonna take one of my cousins.  I know we would have fun, and if not......I will just take one of my CNA buddies from class.  They are also good friends, when I said friends I have a group of 3 friends in which I hang out with alot, but none of them are going!  Bastards!  Oh well, I am over it.  Well I think thats it.

I was like it is not 9:21 , and he was like oh shit, your right.  Well in any case I had to go to this training for 4 hours and had like a 2 hour gap for the amphitheater.  Well I was stuck at blockbuster til 3 PM making a new account which put me down to 1 hour gap.  Had to go back to turn in some paperwork.  Fun night overall, Luther Vandross.  I got to drive the golf cart!  so I take handicapped people from the entrance to the ramps that lead to their seats.  Well it got interesting when the weather turned nasty and nearly cancelled the concert.  It was one of the busiest shows I had ever seen.  The time went by really fast, it was real exciting with the storm and being busy and all.  Well we had an employee auction afterwards and picked up some Busch Gardens tickets as well as some alcohol.  Fun night!  Left early to go hang out with some friends and after being there for like 15 minutes a joke came up, don't really remember what it was about. But one guy said go home!  So I said ""Ok"".  Got my keys out of my pocket and walked out the door and went home.  I think probably the main reason was I was tired and I was curious what their reaction would be if I did go home.  Not like I will ever know since I wasn't there to see it.  Now I am at home at 2:25 in the morning writing this.  I guess its always good.  I like this, thanks Shae!

I had to go to my Japanese teacher&#8217;s house to setup a new computer they bought.  A Celeron 1.4 Ghz HP Pavilion *gag.  Oh well seems to work just fine, she just wants to do some word processing and such, so its sufficient.  After I got back I had to go shopping with my mother for clothes for when school starts next Friday.  I really did not want to go but it was a triple replay weekend at SunCoast, so it was my way of getting there.   
	I just hate to try things on, but I had too&#8230;&#8230;got into this whole fight with my mother about it.  She should get used to it by now.  Ended up getting a bunch of stuff&#8230;&#8230;and then headed off to SunCoast.  I had this whole dilemma&#8230;.should I buy the Jin-Roh Movie Deluxe Edition or the Escaflowne Movie Deluxe Edition.   Ended up randomly picking one&#8230;.came out with the Escaflowne movie, Evangelion: Death & Rebirth, and the OAV to Fushigi Yuugi.  Good day haul overall, and time to write my first check.  The cash register system flagged it, so they had to call it in since it was the first check I had ever written.  AND IT GOT REJECTED!  Out of the $500 I have in my checking account it couldn&#8217;t take out a $150.  I was like WTF&#8230;&#8230;how do you reject a check&#8230;.THE MONEY IS IN THE ACCOUNT!  It was bogus&#8230;..its like trying to get a damn credit card.  Oh well I don&#8217;t understand the whole reasoning behind it.  So I got covered for the amount from a undisclosed source and wrote them a check for the monies so I can start to build up a check history!  I mean WTH!   Oh well that's over now&#8230;&#8230;and my day sucks some more.  This morning I was talking with my friend because we had planned to go to Kings Dominion this upcoming Monday or Tuesday.  And I told him it would have to be Tuesday cause I have to work on Monday and he&#8217;s like I don&#8217;t want to go anymore.  I couldn&#8217;t believe what I was hearing&#8230;..we had been excited about going for awhile since we were all going to school soon.  In other words he just pissed me off.  I don&#8217;t know, he&#8217;s a last minute man.  He&#8217;ll put off everything to the last minute.  He was like I need to register for classes on Wednesday and I was like why don&#8217;t you go register today or Monday&#8230;..and he gave me some bogus excuse.  I was like dude&#8230;you can get the tix for $27 and you don&#8217;t want to go.  I mean normally they are $42.  His reasoning never makes since to me&#8230;..must have been something he read in YAHOO! Life.  God&#8230;&#8230;..
	I was supposed to go in to Blockbuster and fill out some paperwork so I could go to the training tomorrow and my dad got all worried when I didn&#8217;t come home til like 10pm from the mall and I hadn&#8217;t gone up to BlockBuster.  He had called up there right when I walked in the door and he confused me and the guy at BlockBuster in what was going on.  I was like what&#8230;..the guy at BlockBuster was like&#8230;.What?  In the end it all got worked out.  Went up there got everything straightened out, and when I got home I took a shower and am now talking to my good buddy Shae.  
	Hope I didn&#8217;t leave anything out.  This encompasses my pathetic life!  Hope you can feel better now!  LOL!

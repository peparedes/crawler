"event","i went last night to a concert at appleton west high school.  it was like a battle of the band thing.  you were supposed to have a student i.d. to get in, but they didn't check.  anyways. the bands really sucked so we left.  we hung out at barnes and noble and the guy behind the counter hit on erin.  she liked it.  when i got home i ate some cookie dough.  the container cut my hand.  then i went to bed.  

i'm kinda in a crabby mood today.  maybe its because i have to do homework, maybe it's your fault."

"event","i'm sitting here in the hotel computer desk in charleston, south carolina.  prettty sweet eh?  well i'm bored cause it's sunday night and nothing is open so we decided to just go back to the hotel.  i have had a very full day today.  this morning we woke up and went downtown and walked the battery.  awesomely huge houses.  then we had lunch at bubba gumps.  i ate soooo much shrimp.  whatev.  then we went shopping...good times.  then we drove to the beach.  oh the beach.  it was so cold, but emily and i still put our feet in the ocean.  go us!  then we came back to the hotel.  on saturday we visited charleston southern university where i have recently been accepted.  i don't know if i will go there.  but it was a good experience none the less.  

i miss all of my friends severely and i'm glad to be coming home tomorrow.  however, i haven't done any of my math homework yet and so i'm very nervous about getting it done and understanding it.  

well i'm going to go back to the room now.  so i hope to see/hear from everyone soon!"

big news! i was nominated for homecoming court! how weird is that! i honestly doubt it will go any further then just being nominated but i guess we'll see.  i really am just honored to have been nominated, and thats enough for me.

i'm really excited to go rolling! yeah man! oh and if anyone messes with my house they are getting it back ten fold!

i'm going to a switchfoot concert on the 21st in chitown and i'm so stoked! oh man!

so lately i have been figuring out who my real friends are.  its weird how everybody knows you are in a fight with someone when you didn't even know it yourself.  hmmm. well anyways, i don't have much time with school and work and cheerleading to hang out with my friends but when i do, i just let them down anyways.  i can't make everybody happy and that sucks.  i just want everybody to enjoy themselves.  sigh.

ok well lets see lately i have been doing some cheerleading practice like normal.  and last night erin harris and i made our usual ben and jerry's run. but this time we brought some friends along.  i think we should start a ben and jerry's eating club so that i can eat ben all the time.  sigh. when i told this guy that i had ate ice cream he asked me if that was healthy for a cheerleader to be doing.  he's like ""aren't you gonna get fat from eating that kind of stuff?"" i was so upset.  hey whatever, i do what i want. 

i saw an all american rejects music video and i had forgotten how hot the leader singer was.  he has the bluest eyes i have ever seen.    

friday there is a home game so i expect everyone within driving distance to come! ok!?!?!? 

have you ever wanted to just tell everyone exactly what you think of them?  cause like seriously, i notice everything about everyone.  if i have seen them, i have analyzed everything about them.  sometimes i just wonder why people are the way they are.  then i remember, people probably don't understand me any better then i understand them.

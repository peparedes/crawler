Is this an update? Who cares?
{o}The apartment now has Guitar Hero in it's possession. It's actually a friend's, but it stays here so it's practically ours. I have mixed feelings, and find it too distracting and loud. Although it is fun to play a few songs at a time.
{O}I managed to steal more music from Toni. Now I'm up to Necromantix, but I skipped ahead to get the Nerve Agents. I missed them so much, I think I blocked it out.
{o}School is almost over, emphasis on almost. I find myself stressing without any physical manifestations, like oh, I don't know, studying. Or caring. Some part of me, deep down, cares very much, but it's hidden beneath all my other stressors. Funny how that works.

<b>SPEAKING OF STRESSORS:</b> I have gone ballistic, totally batshit insane. And I'm screaming <i>I'm crazy, I'm crazy!</i> but I'm going to do everything I can to keep the spook at bay. I'll tie myself to the cross before I break down my wretched barrier. And I'll laugh and laugh, letting it bubble up from my belly to blow the top of my head off like a flap.
Sometimes you just have to laugh.
And sometimes you have to stop being so hard on yourself. But goddamn, it is <i>hard</i>. I don't know if I care enough to change. After all, mine isn't a terrible existence. I go to class, get decent grades. Live with friends. I even have a garden that I work in when I remember to. People seem to like me well enough.
So why?
Why?"

"event","July has held nothing for me but more things to tire me out, anger,and depression. I hate this month already.
Every day I see them I seem to get into an argument with my parents, which I hate. I always end up muttering, ""Fine!"" and then walking away. And they're pissed about everything, which I can understand because I am too. But yesterday mom was yelling at me because I don't treat them like they matter or something, and I wanted to scream back, that's how I'm treating everyone! My whole focus is just on getting to work and getting moved in to the apartment. I don't have time to think about friends or family or anyone else's feelings, because I am so stressed and tired and if I'm going to think about anyone, it's going to be me. Excuse me for turning into a normal human for a month or so. I know I usually am running around like a chicken with it's head cut off, trying to make everyone happy and comfortable, but for right now, fuck that. I am in such a bad place that if I want to help anyone else, I have to take care of myself first. 

Every day I come home from work, after an 11-hour day, and my mom asks, ""Did you go to work today?""
I say, ""...yes."" Obviously. What the hell does she think I'm doing?
And then she says, ""Oh good!""
As if every day I say, ""I know I need this money desperately, but I think I'm going to go to the beach.""
Or
""I know I should be working and saving up so I can buy groceries, but I think I'm just going to go to my friend's house.""

I am not that irresponsible. I admit, I make a lot of mistakes. I've never gotten through a day without beating myself up for getting the wrong information, doing the wrong thing, just making a fucking mistake. But as much as it might not be apparent, I am trying. I am trying very, very hard. Every time I think about how it doesn't even matter because for all my trying, nothing seems to be changing, or how I have so much else to do and I'm just going to fuck that up too or how my parents seem to think that I'm just gliding by and not thinking about anything whereas in reality I am thinking about EVERYTHING and trying to not be paralyzed by fear of not doing it correctly, I feel another part of me breaking. Soon all that's going to be left is that scream echoing inside me, otherwise I'm going to be hollow.
I am so tired. I want to sleep this life away. Wake me up when it gets better, because I'm not sure how much more of this I can take.
Everyone should just leave me alone. Let me sit in my dirty apartment without a bed and not move because my body is so tired from shifting I can barely move.

I am seriously in one of the worst moods, and have been for the past few weeks. I don't know how much longer this can last."

Clutching at the map of Tasmania stimulates the sex hormones, gets blood flowing toward the genitals and releases pheromones.

It's the release of pheromones that is said to give women in love their ""glow"" and what is being attributed for making women who try the trick appear to be more beautiful.

Women are advised to tug their pubes while they're still dry and then move the clump of hair around in a circular motion. They're also told to run their fingers through their pubic hair the same way they would do when fondling their regular hair.

Women are told not to worry about pubic hairs that fall out and to continue yanking away for about 1 to 2 minutes.

"event","In books such as ""Slaughterhouse-Five,"" ""Cat's Cradle,"" and ""Hocus Pocus,"" Kurt Vonnegut mixed the bitter and funny with a touch of the profound.

Vonnegut, regarded by many critics as a key influence in shaping 20th-century American literature, died Wednesday at 84. He had suffered brain injuries after a recent fall at his Manhattan home, said his wife, photographer Jill Krementz.

In a statement, Norman Mailer hailed Vonnegut as ""a marvelous writer with a style that remained undeniably and imperturbably his own. ... I would salute him _ our own Mark Twain.""

""He was sort of like nobody else,"" said another fellow author, Gore Vidal. ""Kurt was never dull.""

Vonnegut's works _ more than a dozen novels plus short stories, essays and plays _ contained elements of social commentary, science fiction and autobiography.

A self-described religious skeptic and freethinking humanist, Vonnegut used protagonists such as Billy Pilgrim (""Slaughterhouse-Five"") and Eliot Rosewater (""God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"") as transparent vehicles for his points of view.

Vonnegut lectured regularly, exhorting audiences to think for themselves and delighting in barbed commentary against the institutions he felt were dehumanizing people.

""He was a man who combined a wicked sense of humor and sort of steady moral compass, who was always sort of looking at the big picture of the things that were most important,"" said Joel Bleifuss, editor of In These Times, a liberal magazine based in Chicago that featured Vonnegut articles.

Like ""Catch-22,"" by Vonnegut's friend Joseph Heller, ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" was a World War II novel embraced by opponents of the Vietnam War, linking a so-called ""good war"" to the unpopular conflict of the 1960s and '70s.

Some of Vonnegut's books were banned and burned for alleged obscenity. He took on censorship as an active member of the PEN writers' aid group and the American Civil Liberties Union.

The American Humanist Association, which promotes individual freedom, rational thought and scientific skepticism, made him its honorary president.

Vonnegut said the villains in his books were never individuals, but culture, society and history, which he said were making a mess of the planet.

""I like to say that the 51st state is the state of denial,"" he told The Associated Press in 2005. ""It's as though a huge comet were heading for us and nobody wants to talk about it. We're just about to run out of petroleum and there's nothing to replace it.""

Despite his commercial success, Vonnegut battled depression throughout his life, and in 1984, he attempted suicide with pills and alcohol, joking later about how he botched the job.

""I will say anything to be funny, often in the most horrible situations,"" Vonnegut, whose watery, heavy-lidded eyes and unruly hair made him seem to be in existential pain, once told a gathering of psychiatrists.

Vonnegut was born on Nov. 11, 1922, in Indianapolis, and studied chemistry at Cornell University before joining the Army. His mother killed herself just before he left for Germany during World War II, where he was quickly taken prisoner during the Battle of the Bulge. He was being held in Dresden when Allied bombs firebombed the German city.

""The firebombing of Dresden explains absolutely nothing about why I write what I write and am what I am,"" Vonnegut wrote in ""Fates Worse Than Death,"" his 1991 autobiography of sorts.

But he spent 23 years struggling to write about the ordeal, which he survived by huddling with other POW's inside an underground meat locker labeled slaughterhouse-five.

The novel that emerged, in which Pvt. Pilgrim is transported from Dresden by time-traveling aliens, was published at the height of the Vietnam War, and solidified his reputation as an iconoclast.

After World War II, he reported for Chicago's City News Bureau, then did public relations for General Eletric, a job he loathed. He wrote his first novel, ""Player Piano,"" in 1951, followed by ""The Sirens of Titan,"" ""Canary in a Cat House"" and ""Mother Night,"" making ends meet by selling Saabs on Cape Cod.

Critics ignored him at first, then denigrated his deliberately bizarre stories and disjointed plots as haphazardly written science fiction. But his novels became cult classics, especially ""Cat's Cradle"" in 1963, in which scientists create ""ice-nine,"" a crystal that turns water solid and destroys the Earth.

He retired from novel writing in his later years, but continued to publish short articles. He had a best-seller in 2005 with ""A Man Without a Country,"" a collection of his nonfiction, including jabs at the Bush administration (""upper-crust C-students who know no history or geography"") and the uncertain future of the planet.

He called the book's success ""a nice glass of champagne at the end of a life.""

Vonnegut, who had homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons in New York, adopted his sister's three young children after she died. He also had three children of his own with his first wife, Jane Marie Cox, and later adopted a daughter, Lily, with his second wife, Krementz.

Vonnegut once said that of all the ways to die, he'd prefer to go out in an airplane crash on the peak of Mount Kilimanjaro. He often joked about the difficulties of old age.

""When Hemingway killed himself he put a period at the end of his life; old age is more like a semicolon,"" Vonnegut told the AP.

""My father, like Hemingway, was a gun nut and was very unhappy late in life. But he was proud of not committing suicide. And I'll do the same, so as not to set a bad example for my children."""

Remember the camping trip? And the movie they were filming?
It's called The Tripper. It's about A Reagan-obsessed serial killer. Killing hippies.

"event","I was going to write a haiku about this guy that I found on the internet that I think is a total sexpot, and how we're perfect for each other because he likes septum piercings and I think he's majorly hot. So, you know, we should get married and love each other for the rest of our lives and stuff. But then writing a haiku got to be too hard. Counting syllables fucked me up, man. Fuck that.

capturing my interest
on the internet
was the one that I will love

"event","Okay, for one thing, shifting is fucking hard. For those who have not had the pleasure of hearing my near-constant bitching, shifting is my job this week. It consists of taking dusty, heavy books off a shelf, putting them on a cart, moving the cart over a few stacks, and then putting the heavy, dirty, bastard books back on a shelf. But it's a different shelf, and apperantly, much better. Those motherfuckers.
aoh, and I missed an hour and forty five minutes of work. Fucking alarm clocks. Still, my goal shall now be working 38 hours this week.
The only people at work today were Beverly, Savonn(?) and Chandy. So we went out for lunch, which was fun. We went and got pho and they were asking me questions like ""have you ever had noodles?"" ""Do you know how to use chopsticks?"" (Okay, only Chandy. The others just asked me if I had ever had pho. I laughed.) It was all right, but the place was skeezy and Sav found two flies in his food, which was, you know, awesome. I laughed.
And then back to shifting, which fucking sucked balls. God, only 16 more hours and then, NEVER AGAIN."

So this morning, I ate a bowl of fiber cereal, with a banana, and drank a glass of orange juice with added fiber.
Needless to say, 20 minutes into class I had to take the <b>biggest. Shit. <u>EVER</u>.</b>
So I ran back home, flew into the bathroom, and laid the poop down.
What happens next?

THE TOILET CLOGS. AGAIN.

Sorry Dana. 

But seriously, I was filled with shit. Fuck fiber. I could die from pooping too much, you know. It's a serious problem."

"event","yeah....this whole online journal thing really isn't living up to its standards. not that livejournal isn't good. i just don't like not being able to really write what i need to without everyone checkin out my crap. i can't keep two journals...too much to think about. but anyway..man...i got a dilema. i can't even go into detail about this cuz she might be reading this right now. so i'm not going to. this is my last post on this stupid thing. i leave you with the famous words of...TBA...take it easy. live long and prosper. hehe."

"event","PHEW! been a while, no? surry i haven't written in a while but there's been a lot going on. a lot behind the scenes that, unfortunately, i cannot write about in an online journal that everyone can read at any given time. anyways...man, a lot of stuff going on. i've been sick, built a guitar for kyle (which took a whole fucking night...excuse my spanish). we had rehearsal on sunday which i wrote two new tunes for, which, might i say, kick ass in my opinion. my writing, i think, has gotten a lot better since i left cander mill. for some reason, i don't feel pressure that i did with them. i always felt like i was in over my head. they were such great musicians. even though they were my good friends and i grew up with them, i felt like i had something to live up to. now for some reason, i don't. not that i don't respect the guys that i'm playing with. i do. but they don't force me to always be thinking about my best work. now i feel like i can try new things, without a proper set formula. anyway..enough about that. i am finally feeling the pressure of school. it happens everyear at this exact time. right before the 3rd quarter exam. i've been slacking off all year, and now i start to feel the pressure. no more skipping or staying home ""sick."" no more going out to breakfast or getting lost on the way to school and ending up in miami or Epcot. haha.i've actually got to study now. get good grades. one more marking period to go. then....my summer plans take over. Alaska Cruise leaving June 1st!!!!! Time Share in the Keys with my bros for a week over 4th of July! THEN....ROAD TRIP leaving on July 6th!!!! oh man....i'm not gonna be home all summer....its gonna be awesome."

"event","i totally forgot to write last night. i was dead yesterday. probably have the flu or something. i stayed home from school and i'm home again today...which is cool...but only if i'm well enough to go surfing or something. but this is making up for last night. and i guess tonight is the pre-fest concert?? holy shit. i've totally lost track of everything. my grades are really slipping. i just can't bring myself to stay on top of things anymore. i don't feel the drive to motivate myself as much as i used to. thats probably why i got sick. even though i'm always sick...this sux. i've also been looking at colleges lately and talking to some other people about what they're gonna be doing. it seems like everyone around me has this incredible attitude about doing all kinds of outside work and perfect grades and all this other stuff. the college of choice right now seems to be UF. i don't understand any of it. i realize how important it is to get into a really good school so you can grow up to be good people and stay out of jail, etc...but i just don't have that drive to do a million hours of service and get A's in all AP classes and all that...just dont feel like it. i'd be thrilled if i got into FSU. that school rocks. it rocks my kasbuagh, homies. oh man, my temperature just went up again. hehe...thats a cool feeling. yep, i should really do something about it. HAH! i don't even feel like getting up. late dawgs..."

"event","tomorrow is my dad's b-day but we celebrated tonight. ""family time."" yup...fun crap. i like my family but only in moderation...just like anything else. i wrote a few new tunes today though. i felt pretty accomplished there for a while. they were good tunes. i love to write...something i've gotten away from for a while. i find that the more i focus on my writing, my musical technique goes down, becuz i'm only paying attention to the only immediate technique that i need. if only that last sentence was understandable. but ever since i've started writing again, i've felt much more centered and focused. life feels a little bit better. good stuff. however, i am getting sick again. this sux. maybe i'll get PNA again and land myself back in th hospital. they have good brownies. and brownies rock!"

"event","man..new journal thingy. not used to this. i've always kept a journal but this whole online thing that everyone can see is a totally new idea for me. i guess i better keep my extreme personal opinions to myself, eh? 
man, i'm beat. last night was Pegapalooza with my new band, True North. it was a good gig. we played well. i kinda wanna beat up Matt, the cat doing sound. he messed up my mic and i couldn't talk or anything through the entire set. but nonetheless, everything went well. i think i might stick with this band for a while. see where it takes me. kyle's an excellent player. and george and nico are getting better everyday. i feel a total new creative freedom with this band to try and write new and better things all the time...rather than with Cander Mill. i was just in over my head with them. oh well, no regrets. phew...i need a nap now......"

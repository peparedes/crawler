"event","frank abagnale once said, ""Even though I didn't see my dad again, every night after living a brilliant day and meeting many women, and making much money, I'd come back alone to a hotel room and I would just think of my mom and dad and fantasize about getting them back together again, and cry. It's the justification of a fantasy.""

even though in real life, families arent all that happy, the little boy or girl in every person would definitely fantasize about their family being truly whole and happy.

I'm sorry that my parents are this way,
I'm sorry to you sis, for everything,
I'm sorry that i probably have to live my whole life just this way
I'm sorry our family is not perfect."

"event","We live our lives doing mundane stuff everyday. Its annoying how life always gets you, either at the expense of others or yourself. Either ways, people always try to fabricate how they really are with an image they would ideally be but usually everyone's true colours will show after time ah. No point ah brother. But then again, that's life. Oh how i would like a million things, and the most probable way is to get a rich girlfriend; to sustain my smoking habit, my addiction to torturing myself, ruining my body with ink and metal, my over-reliance on cabs. Most of all, i would love someone to be..more than someone you have sex with everyday ah. How should i put this. I can safely say I am getting laid more often than anyone i know of, but that is not really the point. I guess it would be nice to wake up to a familiar face on my bed, everytime i wake up. yup. Instead of yet another random. I'm not asking for a lot what. Just a rich, hot chick, coupled with some good conversational skills, similar interests and nothing that closely resembles my ex-girlfriend. Fuck okay, the shit she did, talking about it just pisses me off. I can safely say we are of a total different intellectual level. But that's life, i fell for her probably 'cause she was always there when i needed someone, and i got used to that. But that isn't love is it now. Well, we gave it a try and all i can say it was too close for comfort. So much for more than 2 lines eh bitch. hahah.

I fucking killed off all my contacts with girls for my ex-girlfriend, because of her insecurity issues, and for that i was not getting laid for a long while la. Ah fuck it, what's past is past.

On another note, I can't stand you. You are seriously as childish as we met 4 years ago. If you can't stand losing money, dont fucking gamble la. Not wrong at all. First it was evelyn who made me not want to hang out with qs all. Huh now you. I always thought aiya fuck it la dont have to talk to you or what but seriously it gets on my nerves too much ah. So much for being blood all. Your attitude clearly shows how materialistic you are, what with treating the rich like gods and the others as though they owed you money. Hopefully you wake up someday, be it in the hands of some fucker that you pissed off subconciously, because your eq is as low of that of an ass. As in nothing comes out of your orifice is good. But enough about that.

Hmmm.. What else can I can talk about. My friend's setting up this tee shirt selling thing. He seems pretty confifuck about it but i kind of get the feeling he think he has everything planned out but somehow something he missed out. Yes, that would be as close in words as i can say about what i think but okay ah, not wrong wish him all the best. And i get free shit too. hahaha.

Okay ah, thats a long entry. Suck my cock okay"

"event","Hello blogosphere. Though there is no one reading i shall pretend hehehe.
okay first and foremost, how much would one pay for a tee shirt? a comfortable pretty alright tee shirt. 10 bucks? 30? do i hear 50? (I'm in the 50 range) No, 80? What the, 200? And thats cheap? For casual wear?

Ladies and gentlemen, behold, life of the rich money throwing bastards. How would one justify a tee shirt to be 200 bucks. For fuck. Style? okay then how about 500 dollars for a pair of fuckign jeans. JEAN DAMMIT. jeans is what, casual wear? 500 bucks? 500 bucks is more than what my maid earns a fucking month sia. 100 dollars levis cannot meh? 100 dollars volcom cannot meh? I THINK MONEY THROWERS SUCK ASS. A 80 dollar pierre cardin or 50 dollar billabong/quiksilver wallet does PRETTY FUCKING MUCH the same thing as a 400 dollars gucci one. And they will probably last the same fucking time la. nahbei cheebye. FUCK U RICH PEOPLE.

Seriously, the ""style"" in a gucci jeans as compared to a (insert random street brand) is worth like 10 times the fucking price? Touche man touche.
Don't start with quality, u do that with giordano or bossini or whatever. NOT FUCKING ATTICUS/FSAS/LEVIS/VOLCOM/VANS ALRIGHT? For fuckheads who argue its fucking for classy occasions read this, I said tee shirts and jeans k? so fuck off. Nahbei cheebye sia.

Jack of all trades leh, not bad also what, especially jacking off. oh i think i shant whine la. stop whining about why do i get chicks who i dont care about into me. I wont whine about chicks who are pretty but i just dont feel the spark from them are into me. I wont whine about the fact that all the chicks i am into are either attached or into chicks. I wont whine about i must now watch porn to jack off because the last sex was months back. I wont whine. Not at all.

On second thought, maybe i did..i wonder who cares enough to search for this.
I love dad though, great person."

"event","I always known i cannot commit to a relationship. Since Irene, this was blatantly obvious. I keep thinking i just need to find the right chick, and everything will fall in place. Right now i keep wanting the chicks who are attached or not interested. haha, its like a fucking game. And i'm contemplating shaving my pubes because i'm kinda always wearing baggy nowadays and my hair-down-there rubs against my boxers, TICKLING me funny.
So yesterday, my buddies went to work for some gaylord fucker folding shirts, earning free money. I didnt go because i had project work to do today. I might be going Zouk tonight but what for? I mean, next week i'm legal and with the police warning dangling over my head, last thing i need is another arrest. Its not fun being arrested la, especially in Singapore, with a low crime rate, the Police has nothing better to do, thus they come arrest us for petty crime. SINGAPORE NEEDS MORE BURGLARS, ROBBERS, THIEVES (okay i was one for about a year but no longer) to make them police officers busy and not fuck around with me. Well no worries because in 1 week and a day's time, fuck the police and bouncers man, i'd be Legal as Cheese. So suck my dick, my sexy man meat, and call me Daddy when you do it. Or hum the-wheels-on-the-bus-goes-round song whilst you suck me. Or both.

I'm really dreading confrontation, things should be made easier. And i hope my sister moves out/dies/migrates A.S.A.P

I think i'm starting to believe in God, my own God, not the one the christians/catholics believe me. My God should be female and sexy, beats yours anyday.

For the record, its 3.18am and i just finished the motherfucking O.C., and i've not touched my accounts. Which i am going too now. Not forgetting, i snipped off my 2-3 months long nails. I need, desperately, to get a crush on a chick or i might suspect myself to be gay soon. I'm hungry.




EDIT: I have no idea what the fuck is up with accountings. Am going to be begging for help from 3-7, 4 hours before the test tomorrow. God/Lucifer, help me in some way please, thank you very much.





Okay so i was talking to my friend about life, and the frailties of men. I quote Brad Pitt from Troy when i say, Everything is beautiful because we are doomed from the day we were borned. This is motherfucking true la. And since we're all going to turn to dust, and no one can help it, lets all just live life to no constraints set by society or the government or whatever your parents expect of fucking you. Least, thats what I'm doing, and i love my parents, but its inevitable they're kind of getting a divorce."

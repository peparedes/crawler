"event","I hate it when I feel lazy enough to not have the ambition to do anything, and yet guilty enough to know that I should be doing something. It's the week before finals, I haven't done any Christmas shopping yet, I've bought a lot of books that I want to read, and I have a ton of music to learn. I just don't have time to actually DO it all, so I guess my indecision stems from not knowing where to start.

My gal doesn't help matters much either. Every day she sends me new music to listen to. The DVD that has Ron Stewart kicking ass with Mountain Heart (which I stared at for an hour today) distracts me from my work. But I mean that in a perfectly good way. Music is my release, and I know that I won't be able to get enough of it in this coming week.

I'm not stressed out over all this...well, not more than normal for finals week. I feel pretty confident about all of these coming exams, which is better off than I've been before. It's just the mountain of work I see ahead of me in the coming ten days. I'm not in fear of it either...I've done more in half the time. But, work comes in the time allotted, and I guess this journal entry is one way of procrastinating.

OK, back to maybe working some before I go to sleep. Maybe I can pull a mini Rip Van Winkle..."

Anyways. Other than that. My valentines day went quite well, as my plans were to avoid all of the nonsense all together.

Bulstrode. No doubt. I don't think Harry's <I>that</i> immature, though I wouldn't be surprised if it was that Weasle. I tried make amends with her. I have been nothing but polite but she's one viscious bird if I do say so.

As for Valentines day..Is it wrong that I missed Potter? I think so. I'm sure he was just fine though. Staying in my dormitory the whole time was probably smart..running into him would have been nothing short of disastrous."

I do think my father is right. About turning off the emotions, except it's not so easy now is it? It's more easy for me to turn my back on Potter if things get a bit difficult isn't it? I honestly think he's glad to be rid of me, which for my sake, I suppose that's not so bad, is it?

I suppose if he wanted, he could break me. But distance can avoid all of that."

"event","So I've been rather scarce lately, and there's a reason for that. I'm not currently at Hogwarts, but I wish I was. Christmas wasn't as eventful as it normally is... maybe that's just because I have someone I would rather have spent it with. 

I got a lot of expensive presents, more than normal, but I'm not really interested in them. As of now, I think they're something of a bribe. I'm sixteen, and my parents are starting to attempt to butter me up for when I'm supposed to get the Dark Mark. I didn't say anything though, because I'm good at acting like an oblivious porcelain doll around them.

Anyway, I've been in France since the 26th visiting my grandparents. No idea why they decided France was a good place to live. No offense, Theodore, but the place is horrible. It's nice to look at, but the people there are so cold and nonchalant about everything... and they don't bathe or shave regularly. Come on. It's called propriety. Why couldn't we have gone somewhere nice, like Ireland, or somewhere exotic, like Japan or something? Oh well. I'm home now.

My trunk's all packed and ready to go, and I'm contemplating going to Hogwarts via broomstick because I can't survive much longer at the Manor. I've befriended one of the houselves, for Merlin's sake.

Only a few hours... back to Hogwarts tomorrow, and term starts on Tuesday. I can't wait.

A lot has happened recently. <I>A lot</I>. You people might not view it as such, but to me, more things have happened in this past month than everything else in my life put together. 

I'm in love.

That doesn't sound nearly as odd as it looks, really. It happened so fast, I can't even really pinpoint the moment I <I>knew</I> or the moment it actually happened... I'd fallen for him faster than I could realize I was treading new and unfounded territory, but by the time I realized it, I didn't even care. I rather like this uncontrollable emotion, I'm just afraid of when it starts to go downhill... what if we start fighting? 

But I don't want to think about that.

One of the reasons I haven't had the time to update is, well... because he's been staying in my dormitory lately. I know what all of you are thinking, and I can bet my money's worth that the majority of you are right. This is going to come out so weird... I lost my virginity to him... and I plan to keep it that way. I don't <I>want</I> to sleep with anyone else. Ever.

I know I sound like a pitiful wibbling little schoolgirl, but this is different... this is <I>real</I>. He says it is, and I think it is, too... and something this great has to be real, right? This isn't puppy love, and this isn't two teenagers believing they're in love simply because their hormones are going mad... this is the real thing. I <I>am</I> in love. 

On a less amazing, but still good note. Tomorrow's my birthday! I'm FINALLY going to be sixteen. It's pathetic how excited I am, but I don't really mind. <strike>And I really hope a certain someone doesn't forget... maybe he'll even do something for me?</strike>. I'm just not looking forward to the letter I'll get from father... I really hope it will have nothing to do with You Know Who. I'm not in the mood for something to evil and depressing, really.

Well, classes are starting soon, so I need to stop writing. I'm looking forward to all the would-be witty comments about my love life. Go ahead, people, make fun of me. It'll make for a decent laugh.

Finch, Weasley, Granger, or anyone else I amuse myself with haven't been around in a while. I'm starting to get really bored, since people who are fun in other ways are really hard to catch alone or make plans with without fear of getting caught... hypothetically, of course.

I hate writing in this thing. Sometimes things are best left private, like things that would only end in my (and possible someone else's) death if it were to get out somehow... and to be perfectly honest, other than those private matters, my life is completely uninteresting.

Oh, and by the way, my last entry, where I suggested something interesting happen to make my day not boring anymore... yeah, that interesting something happened. And ended in us falling asleep and waking up at nearly 6 o'clock in the morning... I freaked out, of course, but up until we fell asleep it was nice...

"event","Today was pretty uneventful (maybe something a bit more eventful will happen before the day's over?), but there's nothing else to do, so I'm writing anyway.

McGonagall kept me after class earlier because she caught me drawing on my essay. Says it's a waste of parchment and that it makes my work look messy. Messy? How? I was drawing what the essay was about! ... Kind of. It had a teeny bit of relevance. I was drawing a bunch of random people and faces and one of them had a small nose... and cats have small noses, and that's what we're supposed to be transfiguring. There, see? It's perfectly relevant. But she didn't buy it and I have to rewrite the whole thing for tomorrow. I hate copying things. Especially when it's unnecessary.

On another note, Goyle has yet to make my hair ""pretty"". Which is good. Well, maybe it isn't. Maybe holding off on it will only make his urge to ruin my hair fester, and then when he finally does he'll completely destroy it. He might <I>crimp it</I>! Crimping is so ten years ago, not to mention an american style. Or he could dye it, which is worse. Do any of you know how horrible I'd look with say, brown hair? Brown's too bland for me. It doesn't stand out, and I'm an extrovert which means I need hair that stands out.

... And that's enough of the girly hair rant. I just realized how terrifically embarrassing these journals can be. I mean, we're writing down our thoughts and feelings and weird little worries... and once I start talking I can't stop, and I end up rambling and making myself look bad. Rambling is bad, even when I do it. Look, see? This realization was supposed to be a one sentence thing, and look, it's a whole paragraph now.

"event","Right then... so laying on a table in the Great Hall watching the ceiling is like laying outside watching the stars, but without the threat of grass stains.

And insomnia is a good thing after all (and NOT just because I get overly philosophical, Theodore) because watching the sunrise with... certain people, is really nice.

The other night (or rather, yesterday morning if you prefer) I couldn't sleep, as usual, but this time I was really restless so I decided to take a walk. I went down to the Great Hall and laid on one of the Slytherin table's benches so I could watch the sky. I was really calming, because I love big rooms. I love being alone in a huge room like that, so my voice echoes when I talk... I feel somehow liberated when I'm in a space like that... And I'm sounding insane again, so I'll just move on.

Anyway, He was there and we just talked... I've never really done that before. Like, with anyone else it was just a short-lived fling that was all about snogging. But this time it's like we can actually have a conversation and have it <I>mean</I> something. And time goes by so quickly, because before we were ready (or at least, before I was ready) the sun had come up. It's weird, when I talk to him I find myself spilling my heart to him and saying things I'd never say to anyone else... and for some reason it feels perfectly normal.

I guess I just feel safe with him. Safe and wanted and I love that feeling.

On a less sappy note... I ran into Finch yesterday. Goyle had run off, and Crabbe and I went to look for him. Of course, we (or rather, I) assumed he'd be in the kitchens. He was, of course, and Finch was there too. And you know what? Finch is <I>terrible</I> at insulting people. He called me Draco (WHAT was up with that?), I corrected him, then he called me Malfoy and asked me to repeat myself because he ""wasn't paying attention""... what, did he not expect me to catch his correction? He was obviously paying enough attention to me to call me by my surname.

It's people like that who make me want to Avada Kedavra something. Honestly, they've never had any back-bone before, and once they get some they're horrible at it. 

On that note... Theodore, <I>why are you helping him</I>? You can't honestly be all that interested in his story. It's complete bullocks! It's just a cry for attention, you know. Like you said, if he actually was schizophrenic, he wouldn't know it.

Jeez, this entry's long. Do I write too much? I tend to ramble, I think. I should work on that...

I feel incredible right now. Disbelieving, but incredible. I feel... I can't even explain it. Wanted, I suppose. Beautiful. Like I'm... not just a porcelain doll, but a real person. I know I hardly make sense right now; I feel very light-headed. 

So basically, and I don't know who's going to read this, but right now I don't care, I had my first 'date' with him (no names to protect the public, <I>some</I> people will know who I mean) today. Although it wasn't really a date, more like a 'sit around and talk' sort of thing. It's not like we went out for dinner, split the bill, kissed in the rain, then he walked me home and left before my daddy dearest could Avada Kedavra him. No, it wasn't like that.

Basically we just talked. A lot. And missed dinner. Damn, it wasn't until I wrote that that I realized I'm <I>starving</I>... But anyway, he kissed me! I had to kiss him first, but it wasn't a real kiss (it was like, less than a tenth of a second long), but after I did that he kissed me and it was incredible. Like, anyone else I've ever snogged rolled into one times one hundred thousand.

And then we held hands. I know that doesn't sound like it's a big deal but it is. I don't want to explain, just take my word for it.

I sound like a girl, don't I? A gibbering little school girl, not like me at all... But you know what? That's fine with me.

I'm away from my parents and can do whatever I want, I'm perfectly free. Well, not really, since there's plenty of school rules to abide by, not to mention the teachers breathing down my neck (especially a certain few who hate me, and it would make their life to catch me doing anything bad).

In any case, it's good to be back. The train ride was much more enjoyable than usual, for reasons I won't mention here. Dumbledore's speech wasn't as long and boring as it normally is, and the food somehow tasted better this year (despite the loss of appetite at the beginning).

Today classes started again... Don't feel like getting into it, because who honestly wants to read about actual school? I know I wouldn't, so I'm not going to bore everyone with a long account of teacher lectures and classwork.

Right now I'm trying to sleep (insomnia? I sincerely hope not). I have no idea where Blaise is, Theodore's sitting by the window writing about something or another, and Crabbe and Goyle are both asleep. Goyle wants in Daphne's robes, in case anyone didn't know already. This was new to me, and I'm slightly put down that Goyle doesn't tell me things anymore (not that I ever pay attention when he does).

Ok, so my father calls me into the parlour in the middle of a heated debate with Potter (not that I was upset to stop; it was a highly embarrassing arguement), and I go downstairs. 

...And do 'you-know-who' I find? That's right, You-Know-Who (lame pun copyright Draco Malfoy, ha). Sitting in my parlour. Drinking tea. With my parents. 

I screamed (more like a yelp, actually). It was VERY embarrassing, but what else was I supposed to do? Dark Lords don't drink tea! They don't make house calls! They don't sit! Well, maybe they sit, but I always imagined a Dark Lord to be some evil guy that stands there and laughs a lot. Not a ""hee hee"" laugh, a ""Bwahahahaha!"" laugh.

So my father turns to me, all smiley and stuff, and introduces me to You-Know-Who as if we should be all buddy-buddy. He shook my hand and smiled at me. I almost shat my pants. Never in my life did I want to touch that man. Never again in my life will I.

Apparently, so I learned after a long discussion which I had no say in, I'm supposed to take the Dark Mark over Christmas holiday. Happy Christmas, Draco, you get an UGLY TATTOO AND BURNING FLESH! YAY! 

I'm not too sure about this. Maybe I'm a coward, but I'm scared shitless of You-Know-Who, I'm scared shitless of the war, and I'm scared shitless of dying. I just really would rather not be on a side. Can't I be on the grey team? You know, the person that doesn't fight for either cause, the one that watches everyone else act like morons.

And my father's strutting around in robes like he's an eskimo or something. He's probably put a self-cooling spell on himself; stupid git, he knows I can't do magic for another year. And he won't let me walk around in boxers and a tank top, either. It's like he <I>wants</I> me to shrivel up and die. I've probably lost a billion pounds this summer from the heat! Ok, so maybe not a billion, more like two; but that's still a lot.

Is this some sort of test? Do I have to bear sweltering heat in order to be good enough for You-Know-Who or something? Not. Cool. In the literal and slang term. Right know I really want to walk through a ghost or something. That'd be nice, even if the mind-blowing cold only lasts for a few seconds.

On a happier note, two months until my birthday! Exactly sixty days. I can't wait! One year closer to being of age. Sixteen's a nice age, though, mostly because I've decided that's a perfect age to start having sex... not that that's the only reason I want to turn sixteen; it sounds a lot older than fifteen. I mean, come on... fifteen, sixteen. Sixteen sounds more mature.

It is rather depressing that my birthday's so late, though. I mean, everyone else's is really early. Theodore's turning seventeen in February, Crabbe and Goyle are in April and May, Pansy's is in January... and then there's me. Why the hell did my parents have to have sex in the winter?

He's got a one-track mind, I swear. Sometimes I think it's <I>too</I> simple: ""You-Know-Who is God! I love me! What's this? People think they're better than me? Please, bitch!""

As for mother, she's very boring. She's always boring. I wonder if she was boring her whole life, or just after she got married. Do people always become boring and redundant after marriage? If so, WHY are they trying to model me after them? They want me to become boring and redundant? Hahaha. No.

So I've taken to laying on my bedroom floor doing absolutely nothing all. bloody. day. (Looks like I'm already becoming boring, eh?) ... I've taken to drawing, actually.

Well... he wouldn't disown me. 1) I'm his only heir and I doubt he'd want to go through all of that again (A little kid running around? Cute, yes, but annoying.

But I'm looking forward to this year... we'll be preparing for N.E.W.T's, but we're not taking them. Thank Merlin for that! I don't think I could stand going through another round of tests so soon.

I do hate our education system, though. They honestly expect a fifteen year old to know exactly what they want to do when they get out of that dump! I mean, some have, like Theodore Nott and probably Potter (""I'm so cool and famous, I'm going to be an AUROR!"" <-- Who can't see him thinking that?), but I had no idea when they made us choose.

I'm thinking of going into the Ministry, or rather, that's what I chose and now I'm convincing myself it was the right choice. I'm thinking the Department of International Magical Cooperation, but you never know.

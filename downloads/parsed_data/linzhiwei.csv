<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/D/donarepa/1065683791_ampirequiz.JPG"" border=""0"" alt=""vamp""><br>You are Form 9, <b>Vampire</b>: The Undying.

<i>""And The Vampire was all that remained on<br>the blood drowned creation.  She attempted to<br>regrow life from the dead.  But as she was<br>about to give the breath of life, she was<br>consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the<br>cycle began again.""</i>

Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek)<br>and Isis (Egyptian).
The Vampire is associated with the concept of<br>death, the number 9, and the element of fire.
Her sign is the eclipsed moon.

As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic<br>individual.  You may be a little idealistic,<br>but you are very grounded and down to earth.<br>You realize that not everything lasts, but you<br>savor every minute of the good times.  While<br>you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you<br>have strong ties with people that will never be<br>broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have<br>because they are sensible.

Huge and born of flame,<br>they burn with light and power and rebirth.<br>Ashes fall from your wingtips. You are an<br>amazingly strong person. You survive, even<br>flourish in adversity and hardship. A firm<br>believer in the phrase, 'Whatever doesn't kill<br>you only makes you stronger,' you rarely fear<br>failure. You know that any mistake you make<br>will teach you more about yourself and allow<br>you to 'rise from the ashes' as a still greater<br>being. Because of this, you rarely make the<br>same mistake twice, and are not among the most<br>forgiving people. You're extremely powerful and<br>wise, and are capable of fierce pride, passion,<br>and anger. Perhaps you're this way because you<br>were forced to survive a rough childhood. Or<br>maybe you just have a strong grasp on reality<br>and know that life is tough and the world is<br>cruel, and it takes strength and independence<br>to survive it. And independence is your<br>strongest point - you may care for others, and<br>even depend on them...but when it comes right<br>down to it, the only one you need is yourself.<br>Thus you trust your own intuition, and rely on<br>a mind almost as brilliant as the fire of your<br>wings to guide you.You are eternal and because<br>you have a strong sense of who and what you<br>are, no one can control your heart or mind, or<br>even really influence your thinking. A symbol<br>of rebirth and renewal, you tend to be a very<br>spiritual person with a serious mind - never<br>acting immature and harboring a superior<br>disgust of those who do. Likewise, humanity's<br>stupidity and tendency to want others to solve<br>their problems for them frustrates you<br>endlessly. Though you can be stubborn,<br>outspoken, and haughty, I admire you greatly.

to quote weilong, ""Bloody SWP bitch... causing eneryone distress of the eve of the new year. Bloody fuck compo... giving lame and obviously stupid excuses in order to make us hand up... ""ying yong wen zi ying gai yong yi ge zhong tou"". Too bad the class won't rebel and all refuse to hand in to her, then go stage a protest in the staff room and mash/break her desk and force the heads to fire her. Bloody bitches deserve bloody work in return for giving us no bloody time and giving bloody stupid advice.
The day I'm allowed to run her through or kill her in any way will be one of my most ecstasy-filled moments in my life. And no, I won't even think of touching her in any way... fouls my hands too much and takes too long to clean. 

I'll do it anyway and fling it in her face tmr and tell her to fuck off and leave us in peace. ""
this pretty much sums up wat i have to say................
i think i'll do pretty much the same......i.e. do it anyway and fling it in her face tmr (figuratively)...........

todae was an okae dae on the whole.............
managed to get an extension for commonwealth essay till tml...............
in lit elective to dae, shou hao was playing with his thermometer and rubbing it with his shorts to try to get it to 40 degrees celsius............and failed.....
key boon commented tt shou hao looked like he was......well, u noe wat i mean.....
it got us laughing...good thing cheng is kinda deaf and blind..........
anyway, during the dumb briefing, i got so bored tt i started to kinda criticise the teacher presenting the dumb thing.......it was so funny.....
for starters, weilong said tt the ng sumting guy spoke funnily......mixed up his r and l......
he said crass list instead of class list......so we started to change all the words in the presentation from l to r and vice versa and said it out loud to each other.....it sounded funny and i spent at least 3/4 of the time laughing.....
and nancy tay is horrible......she was either deaf or trying her best to deafen us......i dun think she realised tt her voice was growing gradually louder and louder..............btw, she pronounced ng as though it was ung.....so i started calling nwl mr ung, to which he replied, ""nonono, not mr ung, i'm called sir!"" or something to tt effect....and said he was a knight....(too much romeo and juliet.....esp the first scene with the servants or something.....all the thumb biting....) i started musing about how weird sirung would sound and he whacked me...ouch(yeah right)..i was highly amused....then there was a point in time where nancy tay mention, ""what is ur position on the topic?"" yi liang immediately turned round and said doggy.......sheesh........btw, i found tt seng(the teacher) stutters a little........she would say half a sentence and repeat the last word of the first half with the second......she also treats us like little kiddies..........asking dumb questions and expecting us to comply and give stupid answers which are already on the screen.............
bah.....tt's bout all i hafta say for todae.....

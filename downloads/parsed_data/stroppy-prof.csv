<b>Edit:</b> So, it's a hoax? From a marketing company. 

Right. 

<a href=""http://www.inkygirl.com/happy-ending-foundation-lemony-snicket-hoax-in-poor-taste/"">This response</a> says it rather better than I can. The clever, clever marketing ploy hasn't made me want to read the series, though. I got through the first few and then lost interest.

Part of the hoax was that the woman who supposedly started the movement had a daughter who became depressed and withdrawn after reading the books.

My heart is racing, my chest is tight, and my mouth feels as if I've been gargling with a mixture of iron filings, grated tin-foil, bile and lemon juice. It is not a delicious combination, if I need to point that out.

In the interests of trying to relax, I spent the past four hours working on a picture of a group of vampires and an unfortunate demonologist. It wasn't particularly good, but it was going quite well and I'd finally got two of the three vampires looking the way I wanted them. 

The program just crashed due to 'insufficient memory', losing everything.

Things that I have learned:

1) The taste of steroids overwhelms all, mints and ginger included. Don't even bother trying.
2) When the list of side-effects accompanying your medication are in miniscule font and a foot in length, do not expect to get off completely scot-free.
3) Save early, save often.
4) You do not own enough throwable items.
5) This is not helping your blood pressure. Go and make some tea."

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 
WATERSTONE'S PICCADILLY
Friday, 20 July 2007, 9:00PM 
At Waterstone's Piccadilly there will be an extra special celebration - a fantastic queue party outside the shop. The magic starts at 9pm, with wizards, entertainers, mythical creatures, games and prizes. Join us, Hagrid, Professors McGonagall and Snape and even a resurrected Dumbledore as we count down to midnight - and the final chapter in the Harry Potter story.

Further details: 020 7851 2400</center>

So... anyone going?

<lj-cut text=""I has a snakey cane"">Following our costumely fun in the HBP queue...

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v15/kaidecca/fun.jpg"">

...it was inevitable that more dressing-up had to happen this time. While I've managed to lose a fair amount of weight since the New Year (52lbs so far), I've some way to go before I feel ready to get to work on a Severus costume. Possibly for Hallowe'en :D But I am willing to suspend my disbelief <s>and subject my chest to a certain amount of restrictive torture</s> to have a go at a pre-Azkaban Lucius.

<small>A well-fed pre-Azkaban Lucius. Shut up.</small>

At the moment, I have a wig, a cane and some bits of Fimo jewellery...

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v15/kaidecca/broochcomparison.jpg"">

...and I'm working on a robe at the moment. Given the lack of Lucius images from OotP, thus far, I'm having to work from his IMDB publicity shot. So the coat/robe is entirely guesswork from the waist down. 

I also have plans to make a stuffed, kickable Dobby, for light relief. Detachable limbs optional :D</lj-cut>

Aaanyway - to get to the point, for anyone's planning to come along , here's a thread to natter about it. Originally, the plan was to go to Oxford Street, but I haven't seen a listing for a party there, so I'm not sure if they've decided to consolidate the queue at the Piccadilly store, or if they're just giving the staff at the Oxford St. store a break. I doubt they'd be running the same party and ents at two central locations."

"event","A tiny ficlet, written for <lj user=""tartan_tabby"">, whose characterisation of Minerva never ceases to inspire me. 

<lj-cut text=""I can't think of titles"">


It was the whispering that caught Minerva's attention as she made her nightly rounds. 

This Christmas, for the first time in years, there were no students staying on at the school, scattered at the four House tables like early snowdrops or punctuating the hallways in melancholy knots and clusters. In the chill that pervaded the castle, it had been a warming thought to the witch; tonight, the children were safe at home, in bed. Just as it should be. Even so, her four-footed patrol was a long-ingrained habit and the exercise sent her off to sleep as neatly as a nip of whiskey - not that she'd deny herself that little pleasure when she finally returned to her quarters.

Sharp cat-ears, slightly tufted at their tips, twitched towards the source of the sound - it was drifting down from the first floor. Not a student, then. A ghost, perhaps? Minerva padded up the staircase as if she owned it, jumping lightly over a trick step which, undetectable to humans, shimmered subtly in her altered vision. At the landing she paused, ears swivelling this way and that, then trotted off down the corridor towards the Hospital Wing.

The door was open a crack; the tabby nosed her way inside just in time to see Albus vanishing into Poppy's office with a single backward glance. She sat back on her haunches, suddenly fretful. The old wizard's expression had been quite unreadable and Minerva, who took pride in her knack for gaining the headmaster's confidence, was struck with an unshakeable certainty that she would never be able to ask him what he had been thinking at that moment. 

A soft sound made her look round, and her eyes widened as she noticed the huddled shape in the bed nearest to Poppy's office. Was that... an Order member? She bounded across the flagstones and took a flying leap onto the edge of the bed, careful not to land on the still figure. Black hair straggled across the pillow, damp from melting snow and a skinny hand clutched the sheet with a fierceness undiminished by sleep. ""Sirius?"" It emerged as a plaintive miaow and Minerva was grateful she couldn't be understood - as soon as she'd said it, she knew it wasn't Sirius Black she was looking at. She picked her way over the bedclothes, stepping over the indistinct form primly and peering at the sleeper's face. 

<i>That Snape boy. Severus.</i> Oh dear. What was <i>he</i> doing here?

She remembered him well enough, though he was not of her house; a sullen, secretive child, quite aware of his own cleverness and possessed of a vindictive streak that had made even his own Head of House murmur behind his prodigious moustache. She curled her tail around her feet and washed a paw, aware that a twinge of guilt was trying to make its voice heard. <i>That's not the whole story, and you know it. Your own students are hardly angels.</i> But it was a half-hearted protest. Few of the teachers liked the boy, and he obliged them by being resolutely unlikeable. She recalled that he'd spent more than one holiday at the school - Horace had vaguely mentioned some trouble at home. Perhaps one cataclysmic row had ended with Snape parting company from his family?But why come here? He'd left Hogwarts over a year ago...

A draught tickled her ear, and she flicked it irritably. She was no closer to finding out what was going on, and she rose, preparing to spring down from the bed. Albus had still not emerged from Poppy's office and Minerva was inclined to change forms and go and knock. It was the memory of Albus' expression that stopped her in her tracks; she wasn't entirely sure she <i>wanted</i> to know what had been busily ticking over behind that blank look. He would come to her when he needed her. When he'd made his decision. 

""<i>Please</i>."" Minerva jumped, a four-footed, vertical leap that was as graceful as it was comical, and landed in a defensive half-crouch, facing the sleeping wizard. Who remained, as far as she could tell, asleep. As a cat, her vision was a pallette of greys, tinged with tantalising hints of blue and green, glimmerings of purple and suggestions of yellow. Still, she didn't need to see red to recognise the shine of blood where he'd bitten his lip until it bled. She edged her forepaws closer, whiskers bristling in troubled curiosity.

""<i>Please...</i>"" It was hardly more than an exhalation, shaped into fragile syllables. ""<i>I have nowhere else to go.</i>"" 

Minerva blinked slowly, absorbing this fragment, and took another careful step, her claws sliding a little way out of their sheaths as she transferred her weight from paw to paw. Snape sighed, and shifted, pulling the rumpled sheet towards him. 

The tabby froze, eyes wide. Inches from her questing nose, the sheet had slid aside, revealing an ugly twist of blackness that stretched along the boy's forearm, from the tracery of veins, blue lines beneath the pallid skin of his wrist, up to a hand's-breadth  from the crook of his elbow. A skull, empty sockets staring mutely as a snake poured from its gaping mouth.

It was all she could do not to hiss. Her upper lip drew back, exposing small, neat fangs, and her skin prickled from nape to tail as her sleek fur stood on end. She'd seen the Dark Mark before - there wasn't an Order member who hadn't watched it ripple, a coil of toxic light, over the house of some unfortunate witch or wizard. But to be confronted with it here, in her own school? That was too close. Suddenly, all she wanted was for Albus to come back and tell the boy, no, he couldn't stay here; that there was no place for him here; that the Aurors were on their way...

She came down hard on the thought, stifling the growl that was building in her throat. <i>Is that the way, then, Minerva? Is that what you'd have said if it </i>had<i> been Black? Or would you have looked for reasons to offer him sanctuary? Wondered what had driven him to such a terrible master? That's hypocrisy, girl, plain and simple. Look again.</i> And she did, forcing down revulsion at the brand, which radiated a sickly power, metallic against the rough surface of her tongue. It clung to the boy's skin like a poisonous spider, alive and malevolent. But that skin was part of a thin arm, the hand knotted in the covering sheet as if it was an anchor, and above the sheet, a face she recalled as well as that of any of her ex-students, settled into the archives of her mind, usually set in smouldering, shuttered anger, sullen defiance, or watchful mistrust. Now there was only weariness and a quiet desperation, echoed in the words she'd overheard.

<i>I have nowhere else to go.</i>

He spoke again, but Minerva could make no sense of the words, if there <i>were</i> words in the agitated, febrile whispering. Barely aware that she'd made her own decision, beyond a dim acknowledgement that the future held an interminable procession of heated arguments with unhappy Order members, she approached the pillow and settled next to it, tucking her feet beneath her and her tail neatly laid alongside her, and purred and purred, until the sleeping wizard quietened and his white-knuckled grip on the bedsheet relaxed. 

The draught from the open door was uncomfortable, and Minerva promised herself that tot of whiskey, once Albus and Poppy returned. Until then, it was a warming thought to the witch; tonight, the children were safe at home, in bed.

"event","As of about 2 o'clock this afternoon, I'll have been playing Severus Snape for three years. That's admittedly only half as long as Alan Rickman has been playing him, but it's a fair amount of time. Long enough to complete a Bachelors degree, or cook about 1.5 million three-minute eggs (if you did them end to end). Having already done a BSc and not having that many eggs, it seemed like the obvious choice.

On the way I've had fun researching and inventing things for Severus to play with. I've learned a thing or two about alchemy, the Golden Mean, Fibonnacci's ubiquitous sequence, and the symbology of snakes. Quite often I've mentioned something in a post that wouldn't make you look twice, but behind a casual reference there's been a mildly interesting fact, or a really bad pun. If I've been playing him right, you probably haven't noticed them all. And I've probably forgotten most of them, so don't ask :D

In the end, though, this would just be a slightly rambling diary if it wasn't for you.

Especially, and I cannot stress this enough, you vacuous case of terminal cuntrot, when you are roughly eleven fucking seconds away from a DOCTORS SURGERY. I know they're difficult to recognise when they're hidden behind a big bastarding sign with MEDICAL CENTRE blazoned across it. I know that walking, breathing and complex tasks like LOOKING AT STUFF is probably a bit of a stretch for you. I know that you probably had a distressing premonition that the fallen woman was a dangerous drug addict, lying in wait to spring up, slit your throat and steal your shopping. 

But seriously, fuck you if you can't at least stick your head round the door of the doctor's and mention that there's a slumped figure by the road.

Fortunately, I decided that being late for my physio appointment was marginally preferable to leaving the poor wench lying there and went over. Grabbed a passer-by and sent them over to get a doctor and stayed with her until someone came. True, I slithered off for my appointment once I'd talked to the doctor, told him what I knew and established that an ambulance was on its way. But I'm not a completely heartless bastard.

After seven weeks of lounging around feeling rubbish, I'm now back at work, just for three hours a day to start with. Next week I'll build up to five, and the following week I hope to go back full time. The steroids were, as far as I can tell, a washout. I had one day of feeling quite good, but that was it and it took me another two weeks to get myself back to some semblance of normality. While I was gone, my workplace screwed with our computer system and we're now running on Windows CE, which sucks like a Dyson on a holy crusade. 

On Tuesday, I had an MRI, which is fine right up to the point they lock your head in a plastic cage and wedge you in a tube for twenty minutes. I do not like enclosed spaces, Sam-I-am. Last time there was a handy mirror angled to give the illusion of space (although the view includes your own feet which is a <i>little</i> disconcerting). This time my view included five inches of empty air terminating abruptly in white walls.

Then on Thursday, having remained awake for the previous twenty-four hours, I had an EEG, which involves attractive blonde technicians gluing electrodes to your head. That, incidentally, was the <i>only</i> good bit. Going to sleep in a strange environment, in the presence of a stranger, is <i>hard</i>. I managed to confuse her nicely by having abnormal responses to the deep breathing exercise - this apparently had something to do with a drop in blood sugar, but after a drink of tepid glucosey water, things went back to normal, so hurrah for that.

By the way, if you ever go for an EEG, take a hat. The lumps of glue do not come out of your hair. There's Something About Mary has NOTHING on the ridiculous hairstyle you will be forced to adopt with glops of what feels like half-chewed toffee stuck all over your head. Do not be tempted to try and wash the stuff out in the hospital toilets, either. It does not work, and you just end up with wet-look stupid hair.

So - I've been off work for almost a month now. Since seeing the consultant last month, I started into a patch of spasticity and fatigue that didn't seem to be easing. When I saw Dr Price, she was all for giving me steroids, but I've always been reluctant to take them - as far as I've been concerned, they're a last resort, not a first choice. 

I think I need the last resort now, though. I'm physically exhausted, and feeling this way is taking a toll on my mental wellbeing. In the end, a short course of steroids isn't going to kill me and I'll deal with side effects as and when they appear. <s>Still don't want them, though.</s> It means three or four visits to hospital to have them administered by i.v., which is a slog, because the nearest hospital I'll be able to have them is Sheffield and I won't be able to drive myself. 

I'm booked into the MS clinic for next Wednesday, where I'll meet with Dr Price again and we'll talk about options. Which are 'take the damned steroids' or 'don't make me hold you down'. Heh. 

In other news, I have my MRI booked for August 29th, so we'll soon know if I have a brain, and then on the 31st I've got a sleep-deprived EEG, to see if I'm secretly sending signals to Mars. Which means I have to spend all of Wednesday night awake. Guess what I'll be doing? ~cuddles internet~ 

So if you're around on the night of Wednesday 30th, and you see me online, give me a nudge - make sure I've not gone to sleep, okay?</lj-cut>

There was some dispute about the sign. Alastor Moody, for one, said that he couldn't see why the side of Light needed a symbol at all.

""Let Voldemort play with his snakes and skulls and lights in the sky,"" he growled. ""We know who we are and what we stand for."" Still, there were many who felt that a rallying banner should be found, something to show the Dark Lord's troops that they were strong and unafraid. 

Remus Lupin, in his usual mild tones, suggested a phoenix. ""It's as much a sign of hope as a reference to Albus,"" he added, only to be answered by a disparaging snort from Severus.

""While I'm sure a large, sparkly bird will strike fear into the hearts of all who stand against us, perhaps we might be better served by a symbol that isn't prone to setting itself alight without the intervention of its enemies.""

Remus leaned forward to retort, but was checked by Minerva, who laid her hand on his arm and shook her head.

""Let him be, Remus. If the crabbit auld sod doesn't vent his ill temper on someone, he gets the most terrible hiccups. Don't you Severus?"" She turned a sweet smile on the Potions master, who subsided, unable to think of a response.

Other ideas were put forward - lions and eagles and all manner of creatures, although Severus, unsurprisingly, did not suggest a snake. It was only when a lull in the 'lively debate' was reached that Neville spoke up.

""What about a dragon?"" he ventured, then turned a vivid and attractive shade of red, very much like a nervous radish. When no-one sneered at him immediately, he went on, encouraged. ""Only... I know we're fighting for more than just the school, but... well,"" he cleared his throat, discomfited by the sudden attention, ""Hogwarts is where we started, most of us. Even if some of us could do magic before we went there, without Hogwarts  we'd just be wizards. Instead of... um... <i>Wizards</i>."" 

And there was something so earnest, so affectionate in his voice when he spoke of the school, that Hermione didn't comment on his use of 'wizards' to describe all of them, and even Severus couldn't muster the spite to pick apart his words.

""So, it ought to be a dragon, you see, because that's what Hogwarts <i>is</i>. A sleeping dragon, I mean. Except it's not asleep any more. It's awake and... and... it's ready to fight."" He sank back in his chair, heat radiating from his scarlet face until Pomona was tempted to light her pipe on the tip of his ear.

There was another moment of thoughtful silence, and then the sound rushed back as everyone tried to speak at once.  It was past midnight before the meeting came to a close.

But in the end, they used the dragon, anyway.</lj-cut>"

Everything is too high to reach. There is nowhere in the entire place where you can stop without being in someone's way - consequently, where one would normally wander along, browsing the shelves, you are swept along by impatient people who simply cannot wait an extra bloody minute to snatch up their shrink-wrapped feta and brioche and so stand, impatiently glaring, because you're inconsiderately blocking their access to said products while you attempt to reach the tantalising heights where nests the Florida salad. 

The aisles are too narrow to be able to turn around, especially when welded to one of their mobile skips masquerading as trolleys.  And they don't help matters by filling what little space there is with inconvenient display bins, canopied freezers and seemingly abandoned stock-carts. At one point, someone asked me to move out of the way, rather than simply shifting the empty stock trolley a member of staff had abandoned in the middle of the aisle. So I leaned across and shoved the thing aside and said ""There. Think you can manage?"" for which I got a dirty look. Fucker.

I had the turning circle of an aircraft carrier and it's impossible to get up close to any of the deli counters - reverse parallel parking is a doddle by comparison. And yes, hilarious bloke. The snide little 'wide load' comment was really fucking funny. Let's switch places and see you laugh it up when you can't do something simple like buy your fucking groceries.</lj-cut>

<i>The Home Office has dimissed an American television report's claims that Britain is more violent than the US as a ""simplistic comparison"". The TV report, which followed news of an apparent drug rape of an American teacher in London, described the streets and shopping centres of Britain as a ""battleground"" of crime. CBS News called the UK one of the most violent urban societies in the western world, where people were more likely to be burgled, twice as likely to be robbed and two-and-a-half times more likely to be assaulted than in America.

Americans watching the CBS report, which was also shown on Sky News, were presented with an alarming picture of Britain. CBS News anchorman Dan Rather said: ""Now, like the US, the UK has a crime problem. And believe it or not, except for murder, theirs is worse than ours."" He promised that: ""Mayhem is on the way."" </i>

Fortunately, we know how to deal with threats of violent crime...

Derby Evening Telegraph - June 26th
<b><big>Masked axeman put to flight by shopkeeper's chocolate missiles.</big></b>
 
<i>A grocer took sweet revenge on a masked axe-man who tried to rob his store.

Praful Patel had a box of 32 Topic bars in his hand and hurled them at the robber, who had threatened him with an axe and demanded cash. The raider then ran from the store, tearing off his black balaclava as he ran into Town Street, Pinxton. 

The raid took place at 6.55pm on Friday.

Mr Patel (60) said: ""I had a full box of Topics in my hand because I was filling the shelves. ""I threw them and he just took off, running out of the shop and turning towards the crossroads. It was a very scary thing and I was glad to see him go.""</i>

"event","<lj-cut text=""Cut for health blither."">I had my yearly medical assessment thing today. The doctor wasn't happy about the convulsion things I've had in the past few months. She says they probably aren't 'fits' as such, but 'cross wiring episodes' in my brain - basically, electrical signals jumping back and forth across demyelinated nerves and causing the muscles to contract of their own accord - myoclonus, I think it's called. I've got to go back for an EEG and a new MRI scan to see if there are any new plaques. What worries me most is that she's said depending on the findings, I may have to notify the DVLA... potentially, I may lose my driving license. I don't think it'll come to that, but the worry is there, you know?

She's also found some loss of sensation and weakness on my left side, but that should pass. Dr P. says my recent symptoms suggest I'm starting a relapse, but as I've been on interferon the whole time, she's worried that I may be starting to reject the medication. Apparently some people start to form neutralising antibodies to interferon a few years after starting on it. They'll carry out antibody assays to see if that's happening. If it is, I've two choices - either to remain on the interferon and hope that it passes (which it does in some cases) or to go onto a non-interferon therapy (Copaxone, probably, which I don't want, as it's supposed to cause weight gain and I could do without that, thanks). If the antibodies do show up, it'll be instructive, one way or another - people who maintain high levels of NAbs are thought to have faster disease progression. I won't know anything more until I get the various test results.</lj-cut>

Now for a little story. 

The Covenanters were Scottish Presbyterians who signed the National Covenant in 1638 to confirm their opposition to the interference by the Stuart kings in the affairs of the Church of Scotland. A history of the Covenanters can be found <a href=""http://www.sorbie.net/covenanters.htm"">here</a> as it does a masterly job of summing up the story.

To quote an extract: ""The captured Covenanters were crowded into part of the High Kirk in Edinburgh known as 'Haddock's Hole'. They were brought before the Justiciary Court and on December 7th 1666 they were found guilty and sentenced to be hanged on the Mercat Cross in Edinburgh. As many as ten at a time were despatched on one scaffold, dismembered and the pieces exhibited in the Covenanter's own locality as a warning.""

The Covenanters' prison - this is locked and only one ghost tour company is able to open it to the public.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v15/kaidecca/covenanter1.jpg"">

There is said to be a violent poltergeist that haunts the Covenanters' prison. 

<i>George MacKenzie was in charge of the Prison in the 17th Century and was also a local Advocate and became infamous for the glee with which he would sentence the Convenanters to swing on the gallows. He was most definitely a ""hanging judge"". MacKenzie's tomb is near the site of the prison, however this is not where the poltergeist activity takes place. It seems that the ghostly judge prefers to haunt the last resting place of his victims within the prison.

The area has - like much of Edinburgh - been the site of much paranormal activity and ghost sightings over the centuries. However the poltergeist only really became active after an incident in 1998 when a ""tired and emotional"" local desecrated the MacKenzie tomb. Since then the MacKenzie poltergeist appears to have been on a rampage and there have been numerous reports of tourists and visitors to the Covenantor's Prison being set upon by an unfriendly entity.</i>

It was fairly quiet while we were there. I'm pleased to say.

It was quite a big place and crammed with cabinets full of weird stuff. These pictures don't do it justice - I have loads more, but you might kill me with sticks.

As usual, the presence of Nic resulted in me running around at night with a mask on, scaring the Muggles. In this case, literally - a man returning from (we think) the pub, came upon our little photo shoot, looked at us, mumbled ""...my mistake..."" and ran away. Yes, the pics are dark. They were taken... in the dark.

"event","Voici un ficlet to be shared equally between the birthday girls on my lovely flist, as I'm rubbish at keeping up with birthdays. Tis short, silly and rushed, but it comes from the heart :)

<lj-cut text=""I know, I really need to get a beta, but I suck."">The story of Hansel and Gretel is, as every British witch and wizard knows, a tissue of appalling lies from start to finish. Cannibalism amongst wizarding folk has never been common; quite aside from the moral implications, the existence of Polyjuice and shapeshifting means that one would never quite be sure who one was eating. Severus Snape (who had been told the tale at the age of three, further cementing his belief that Muggles were a lying bunch of wizard-hating bastards) was coming to the conclusion that, while there wasn't a single grain of truth in the story, the pub table around which he and his fellow Death Eaters were sitting was very probably made of some form of cleverly moulded caramel.

With an uncomfortable cough, one of the shadowy figures leaned forward to pick up his beer, but the table was having none of it. A minute-long struggle ensued, until finally the glass came free with a wet, sucking sound, slopping some of its tepid contents up its owner's arm. <i>If not caramel</i>, Severus observed privately, <i>then some other dark brown confectionary with the sticking power of hippogryff-hoof glue. They should patent it.</i> A particularly intriguing graffito carved into the tabletop announced triumphantly that Mad-Eye Moody only had one <i>something</i>; the varnish had begun to flow back, lethifold-stealthy, rendering the last word unreadable, and Severus dismissed the possibility that the word could be 'eye' or 'leg' as both obvious and unsatisfying. He was, however, reasonably certain that whatever it was, it was too short to be 'purpose in life, that being to stump around like the illegitimate offspring of a cataclysmic mating between a rabid pirate and a seer's supply shop, getting on everyone's nerves'. Even with really tiny writing, it would be a stretch.

He'd been staring at the table, thronged with glasses in the same way a rotting tree stump sprouts toadstools, so that he didn't have to make eye-contact with Lucius Malfoy, who was watching him over the rim of his glass with an air of expectation. As though sensing Severus' discomfort, the blond wizard smiled serenely, and ate the cherry off the end of his paper umbrella with a single, decisive bite.

""Come on, Severus,"" he cajoled silkily, ""I'm sure you'll make a splendid job of it. I'd do it myself, but I absolutely must be back at the Ministry by one, and it really is out of my way. And you know that this lot haven't the least bit of finesse. They'll just blunder in and panic and <i>then</i> where would we be?"" Rather than looking affronted, the other Death Eaters made various noises of affirmation and looked hopefully at Severus.

""I'm not doing it."" There was a chorus of indrawn breaths around the table. Severus, who had kept his own glass in his hand, unwilling to relinquish it to the embrace of the treacly varnish, took a sip of whiskey to steady himself and glowered at his comrades. ""One of you lot can stick your neck out. You know as well as I that if He's pleased, you'll all try and make out that you were involved and if He's not, it's me who'll be on the wrong end of a Cruciatus."" A murmur of denials greeted this, but Severus was unconvinced. ""You bloody will,"" he insisted sulkily. Lucius sighed. He could see Severus' point - the Dark Lord was unpredictable at the best of times and His assembled loyal would cheerfully throw one of their number to the wolves, so to speak, if the mission was unsuccessful. Fortunately, he'd come prepared. 

""I do understand, of <i>course</i>, Severus. Look, you know that translation of <i>Sefer ha-Levanah</i> I picked up at Borgin's? I recall you expressed an interest. It's yours, if you just do this."" He met Severus' gaze, aware that the dour wizard was delicately sampling his outermost thoughts, and tried not to fidget at the uncomfortable sensation of spiders' feet tickling the inside of his skull. It would be a wrench to lose the book, he decided, but it was worth it. 

At last, apparently satisfied that Lucius meant what he said, Severus drained his glass and stood. ""All right. But this is the last time, do I make myself clear?"" Emphatic nodding and a few relieved smiles answered him, and Severus gave them the sort of look he normally saved for Longbottom on those rare occasions when the boy narrowly avoided one of his usual catastrophes. ""Good. And next year, one of you lot can buy Him His bloody birthday card.""</lj-cut>"

'Nice' is a subjective term.

I, being of rather sturdier construction view the recent hot weather as a personal affront, and watching you prance around telling me how 'nice' the rising temperatures will be in your bikini-clad neck of the universe merely makes me want to fold your impossibly frail form, concertina-style, and fan myself with you until I feel better.

The books are about two camels. One is tall; the other is small. Trust me, it all makes sense.

The original badge was made in sculpey, painted with fifteen million layers of latex (and a lot of hairdryer action) which was then removed, reinforced and used as a mould to make fourteen copies. Liquid gold leaf painted on - the fumes are faintly hallucinogenic, or so the purple caterpillars kept telling me. 
<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y49/wyvernbooks/faqibandaliemblem.jpg"">

A finished cover. The leather was folded into <a href=""http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/don/fg/fg30.gif"">library corners</a>, cutting out that irritating problem of exposed boards, and the badge set into the cover. The painted border is based on a couple of Islamic bindings - the squiggly bits are faux Arabic calligraphy.
<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y49/wyvernbooks/faqibandalicover.jpg"">

Quite often, proper Islamic bindings have a third section that folds around the covers, but I omitted these, partly to simplify the process of binding and partly because I felt it would have overwhelmed the fairly thin books to have yet another layer of covering.
<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y49/wyvernbooks/faqibandali2.jpg"">

The borders were drawn on lightly using a stencil that I cut in heavy card, then handpainted in using liquid gold leaf. The calligraphic decoration was added freehand afterwards.

Well - I had dark red highlights (lowlights?) and with blonde hair, it averages out as sort of red. I'm actually quite pleased with how it's turned out, given that I had a tiny panic as the <i>vivid</i> red dye was being painted on and suddenly wondered if I'd made a huge mistake.

It wasn't nearly as bad as the first one, and I managed to settle and get back to sleep within about half an hour, so that's an improvement. The MS nurse never bothered to phone me back when I left a message the next morning, so clearly it's not of great significance.

No, my <i>bete noir</i> at the moment is little holes in my basic <s>arithmancy</s> arithmatic. Really simple things, and it's <i>very</i> annoying. I've always been strong in that sort of thing, from working as a waitress and having to make change without a fancy till to work it out for me, to doing statistics at uni.

I was trying to work out how much to give my Mum towards her new cooker, as the old one has packed in and the damn things are expensive, and couldn't understand why it was coming to so much.

It took me half an hour with a pen and paper to realise that I was dividing 60 by 8 and getting 5.

Five eights are sixty. Right. Yes, I <i>know</i> five eights are forty. It's happened a lot over the last week - mostly with the eight times table and a little with the twelve. Which is stupid. I've been able to do basic maths without even thinking about it since I was about seven. And now there are these idiotic little holes.

As I'm in a charitable mood today, I thought I'd give you the benefit of my vast wisdom and point out a few things. Pay attention; I'll be asking questions at the end<small><sup>1</sup></small>.

<b>We are not the Jobcentre.</b> I know it's confusing, what with the large sign with '<i>Jobcentre</i>, goddamnit<small><sup>2</sup></small>' nailed up over the Jobcentre, two streets away. Saying that you have an interview here today will not miraculously make it so, no matter how vehemently you insist. You shall not pass.

<b>We are not the Tourist Information Office.</b> <i>That</i> is the eldritch edifice about five doors away, cleverly camouflaged by the words 'Tourist Information Office' over its ancient, glistening pillars. And, having acknowledged that we aren't Tourist Information, do not then start asking me about the locations of local golf clubs because a) I don't know and b) I couldn't care less if you die old and unsatisfied and never lay your hands on a golf ball again in your entire dreary life. I will, however, trawl eBay for a badly splintered mashie-niblick and ram it handle-deep up your arse if you don't go away.

<b>We are not an Estate Agency.</b> Look for the subtle clues. We aren't <i>hiding</i> the pictures of houses in a secret cupboard, only taking them out once every solstice to worship them in all their bijou and desirable magnificence... are you getting the idea, or should I just crawl under my desk and sob quietly? On a related note, no, you can't take the newspapers away with you, you scrounging arse-tart. 

Finally;

<b>If it was National Don't Bother Washing Month, I'm sure I'd have heard by now.</b> Please locate the nearest available shower and stand under it until the festering stench of jealously hoarded bodily exudations dissipates. My nose is threatening trial separation.

Hoping you die in a freak accident involving a self-basting turkey and an extra-strong roll of dental-floss,

"event","We have a number of characters up for grabs, after RL commitments and other circumstances absconded with some of our players. I'd like to echo <lj user=""kaitkaitkait""> in offering a massive thanks to all of them for their brilliant contributions to the game and hoping they'll drop in from time to time to see what's going on.

The characters we're in search of are:

Ron Weasley
Draco Malfoy
Hermione Granger
Luna Lovegood
Neville Longbottom
Colin Creevey
Ernie MacMillan
Parvati Patil

If you're familiar with <lj comm=""Hogwarts_Live"">, you may notice that some of the characters seem to have posted recently - this doesn't mean the character is already taken - we have a few 'caretaker' players in place, keeping the characters semi-active until a player can be found. Information about the game can be found at <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/hogwarts_live/246886.html"">The Players' Guide to Hogwarts Live</a>.

Got a question? Take a look at the Players' Guide for answers, and under the <lj-cut text=""shiny lj cut"">shiny lj cut... 

<b>Q:</b> Can I apply as an OC?
<b>A:</b> Sorry, no - we do have some original characters in the game, but they are long-established and we'd like to keep applications to canon only.

<b>Q:</b> Please? They're a really good character.
<b>A:</b> No.

<b>Q:</b> Ple-
<b>A:</b> Stop it.

<b>Q:</b> Where's the application form?
<b>A:</b> There isn't one. We don't need to know their height, weight, hair/eye colour or favourite colour. Just send us a short sample post - it doesn't necessarily have to fit with current plot (although that would show you'd taken a look at the other journals and would be a definite point in your favour) but is meant to give us an idea of if you have a convincing 'voice' for the character. Some notes on the way you see the character's personality would also be helpful.

<b>Q:</b> Can I apply for a canon character not on the list?
<b>A:</b> You can - we'd be interested to see applications for Blaise Zabini, Hannah Abbot, Arabella Figg and Hestia Jones, but if you have another canon character you're burning to play, email us and <i>convince</i> us.

<b>Q:</b> How much time do I need to commit to the game?
<b>A:</b> We look for at least one post a week - some people post more often than that, but you don't have to post every day. We are, however, looking for active, enthusiastic players who want to help advance the plot and who are willing to come up with ideas for their character.

<b>Q:</b> Do I have to read all of the other character journals?
<b>A:</b> Well, if you don't, how are you going to know what's going on? Yes, basically. If you want other people to read your character journal, it's simple courtesy to take a look at everyone else's. Besides which, the journals is where the plot happens. Different facets of the same plot may turn up in different journals

<b>Q:</b> Even the bits marked <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v15/kaidecca/icon_private.gif""><b>Private</b>?
<b>A:</b> Yes - see the Players' Guide for more information on private and locked posts.

<b>Q:</b> Who writes the plot?
<b>A:</b> <i>Everyone</i>. Although the moderators have some idea of roughly the direction we'd like the game to go, the story is powered and driven by the inventiveness of the players. Nothing is hard-and-fast - if you have an idea and you're not sure if it will fit in, grab a moderator and have a chat. We're flexible and, if your idea is workable, we're pretty willing to move things around. 

<b>Q:</b> What do the moderators do?
<b>A:</b> We moderate :D If you have concerns about your character, want to discuss ideas for plot, need someone to help break the ice with other players (who are wonderful, friendly people, so don't be nervous), need something Britpicking, or just generally want to chat about the game, we can be found on Yahoo messenger and via email. We do encourage players to talk to one another as much as possible, though, and to try and resolve any problems themselves before coming to us.

<b>Q:</b> What <i>don't</i> the moderators do?
<b>A:</b> The mods aren't responsible for thinking up things for you to do, although we're very happy to talk to you and help you if you're stuck. Nor do we expect to have to chase you for posts - if you're applying, we assume you're enthusiastic about playing and won't <i>need</i> to be chased. We do understand that real life sometimes takes priority, but we do need to be kept informed - if you just vanish, we may assume you've lost interest.

<b>Q:</b> Slash?
<b>A:</b> No thanks. We aren't rabid slash haters, generally - it just doesn't fit in on <lj comm=""hogwarts_live"">. We also have some young players, so we ask that players are responsible about their posts. Try to keep the effing and blinding to an elegant sufficiency and if you <i>are</i> lucky enough to have the red hot smex, we don't really want the gory details.

<b>Q:</b> Can I apply as an OC?
<b>A:</b> Don't make me hurt you.

<b>Q:</b> Are you following HBP canon?
<b>A:</b> No - the game started during February of Harry's sixth year, two years ago - while we may make use of new canon info (such as blood status or new spells) or characters, we are not following the events of HBP. We are working on a plot synopsis, but the main thing to know is that Hogwarts has been attacked and overthrown by Voldemort, the students and staff are hiding in a series of 'safe houses', linked by Floo connections, and are carrying on the school as best they can, and Lucius is back at the Ministry, scheming.</lj-cut>

"event","&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amsterdam was silent and had been so for a week. No more marching columns of German soldiers going past our house singing <a href=""http://www.fatherryan.org/holocaust/Reich/Web%20Site/Die_Fahne_hoch.htm""><i>Die Fahne Hoch</i></a> and disappearing into the Holy Way swimming pool for their weekly training session. No more high-strutting German officers walking to the hotel on our canal, which was the exclusive meeting and drinking place of the higher ranking occupation troops.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even very few Amsterdammers on the street, only going out to fetch the daily spoonful of food from the hunger kitchens. For me, twelve years old, the only reason for standing on the side of the Singel looking to the other side of the canal was that our neighbour had told my mother that he had heard that the war was nearly over. After two years of rumours, we did not believe it. Only last week, the Germans, in a <i>razzia</i> or roundup, had found a Jewish couple in the house in the Beulingstraat and had executed them on the spot and taken the family who hid them away. We had been standing for half an hour but somehow the three of us had grown to a party of about ten. There was no reason for this - to form a crowd was forbidden and attracted immediate arrest.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ""I was told,"" Mr van Bossum said, ""that radio Free Holland broadcasted that capitulation was imminent.""
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ""I heard that the Tommies are already in the Hague,"" said Mrs Hoog.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I knew that 'Tommies' were English soldiers and 'Yankees' were American. I had some strange notion that they somehow were different from all those normal people that we saw every day. 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly we heard a motor car and in the extreme stillness of the day it sounded very loud. There, near the library, appeared a German open staffcar driven by a soldier and, in the back, a German officer. They were driving fairly slowly. Suddenly I saw a most extraordinary sight. From the side of the square a small party of about four men dressed in overalls with armbands, carrying guns, came slowly towards the car and motioned the officer out of the car. I could not believe that the German just put up his hands and came out of the car. 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ""They are the Underground,"" whispered Mrs Van Bossum. ""It must mean it is all finished.""

I wish you'd been able to finish writing this, Dad. I knew a lot about you, but I never knew you could write. It's been two years since you died and it hasn't stopped hurting. In a weird way, I hope it never does.

I miss you, and I love you."

I'm trying to make a start on assembling the book, so thank you to those who have already donated and everyone else - please, please <i>please</i> could you have a go at sending me a picture, and prod anyone else you think might help me out?

I need to try and have everything together by the middle of May at the latest, please, as I want to get everything finished by the end of June.

You're all stars!

It could be Hermione abusing her Ministry-issued time-turner, certainly, but someone else could get hers or get one themselves, by legal or illegal means. What happens - all yours. Funny, angsty, dark, light, dramatic, we love them all.</i>

And this was what sprang to mind.

Currently I am overdosing on <a href=""http://www.innocentdrinks.co.uk/drinks/drinks.html"">innocent</a> pure fruit pineapple, banana and coconut. Having an undeniably sweet tooth, it is terribly hard to resist.

It's also meant to be rather healthy. A 1 litre carton contains:

1 &#0189; crushed pineapples
3 &#0189; mashed bananas
2 &#0189; pressed apples
coconut milk
freshly squeezed orange juice 

and nothing else. Fresh fruit and fresh fruit juice. No concentrates, water, sugar, colourings, preservatives or mind-controlling drugs. Although the box does say that it includes a rubber duck. I think that's a lie.

The down side, if there can be one, is that it's so bloody moreish, you could easily drink a litre in the course of a day. And a litre of the stuff is 738 calories. Yipe. 130g of sugar (from the fruit and coconut milk).

Never mind. I've had 380% of my RDA of vitamin C. People will be cured of colds, just by passing within ten feet of me. ~gestures in fruitly benediction~"

<lj-cut text=""Health blither - feel free not to read"">
At the request of my outreach nurse, I'm going to start keeping a diary of my symptoms, which will bore the earlobes off you, so please don't feel obliged to read anything marked 'health'. I think LJ is probably the only way I'll manage to keep a consistent diary (after all, two years and counting with <lj user=""aculeatus""> ~g~) Hopefully there won't be many entries, but it'll help keep my head straight regarding symptoms and relapses, and then I might actually convince my consultant that he should spend more than three minutes a year talking to me.

Well, you never know.

Monday night/early Tuesday morning, woke at about four, shivering uncontrollably. Both hands numb. After a few minutes of trying to work out why I was cold under two duvets and a bedspread, shivering turned into convulsions, which lasted nearly an hour and a half. Managed to wake Mum after about twenty minutes; she lay next to me and held me down until it died down into periodic spasms. Spent most of that time trying to reassure Mum. Not sure that's how it's meant to work. Glad of the big bed, which made it somewhat easier not to judder myself into a wall or onto the floor. Floor not at all tidy. Note to self: might be an idea to leave softer stuff on the floor. Cushions. Cuddly... dragons. Etc. Took 1 Symmetrel and another after a few hours sleep. Need to start taking Zanaflex again. Feeling in hands came back at about nineish. Slept on and off till afternoon, then got up, but very weak. Tuesday night - a bit twitchy, but better. Wednesday - walking fine, using stick. Blood tests - LFT FBC and the one I can never remember.</lj-cut>"

"event","There are times when I get rather tired of being polite and accomodating. Actually, 'tired' is somewhat of an understatement. In the interests of accuracy, I shall begin again:

There are times when deferring to ignorant wankers (who, if I had my way, would be skinned alive and dropped in the middle of the Sahara with a tube of lemon-juice sunblock) instills in me a desire to pick up the nearest pointy object and stab them in the eye.

Better.

The power to our street went out yesterday (hence my lack of presence in Interweb Land) and although the electricity people assured us that their '<i>engineers are working on the problem and hope to have it resolved shortly. Press 'one' for other insincere platitudes. Press 'two' to be cut off</i>', the night passed with no signs of it being restored. For us, no electricity also means no heating, as our gas boiler requires that magical spark to ignite (and due to the regulations, it's a sealed unit, so you can't just shove a match in there and hope to keep your eyebrows), and for the pump to chivvy the hot water around the house. Fortunately, we're a resourceful bunch, and have a camp stove so that <s>civilisation did not crumble</s> tea was still available. Oh, and ablutions could be performed. Priorities, people.

This morning, 'press one' told us that '<i>engineers are sitting in the van, eating Pot Noodles and laughing uproariously at a pirated tape of Jim Davidson</i>'. Well, it didn't, but in all other senses, it's true. So, no power this morning (and it is <i>cold</i> in the Wilds of Derbyshire today - temperatures are set to reach the heady heights of 3&#176;C (30&#176;F for you weird foreign buggers) and tonight the forecast hints ominously at -4&#176;C (24&#176;F)) and in the end, I slithered into work an hour early so that I could at least dry my hair.

There's no power point near the bathroom (which sports the only mirror), so my hair looks rather... unique, today. You know those terrifying plastic trolls? Yeah.

So, all in all, I started my morning in a somewhat <i>touchy</i> mood. This wasn't improved by having to listen to a forty-five minute rendition of the car alarm symphony performed by a Ford Mondeo, clearly bored and looking for attention while its pillock of an owner meandered around Somerfields, buying Dairy Lee triangles and mining his nasal cavities for items of interest. 

The centre was, unsurprisingly, cold and I spent a few happy minutes lingering lovingly over the storage heater, thawing out.

Then, my work colleague arrived. Far too sodding cheery for a Monday morning, even on a more auspicious day than this. Having grunted vaguely at her pleasantries, I unfolded my Tale of Woe<small><sup>TM</sup></small>, which was met with  appropriate sympathy. So, you understand, we had established that I was extremely cold and distinctly out-of-sorts.

And then the silly bint went and opened the back door of the office, letting out all my precious, hard-won heat. And left it hanging open.

""Um... do you mind if I close the door? Like I said, I'm pretty cold, and it's...""

""Oh, well it was a bit stuffy in here, so I want to get some fresh air. I'll close it in a bit.""

...

""Fine. Soon, please. I'm cold."" 

While short, and to the point, it lacks something as a response. And it's nowhere near as satisfying as ""No. <i>Now</i>, you inconsiderate arse-tart, or I am liable to wind up and punch you so hard that, should you ever pursue your oft-professed desire to take up genealogy and seek out your ancestors, you will find, scribed in a spidery hand on a sheet of well-worn vellum, a reference to mysterious bruising on the face of your maternal great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother, thought at the time to be the onset of the pox, and resulting in her involuntary incarceration in a small farmhouse in Cheam until her eventual death, caused by choking on an unexpected vole.""

And I'm <i>still</i> bloody cold.

<small>p.s. I don't know when we'll have power back, so I may not be around online this evening. I'll keep you posted - sorry if you're waiting for me to respond to an HL post - I'll try and get round to it today. xxx </small>

<b>UPDATE</b>: Info from phone call... actual flesh-and-blood engineers are even now digging up a section of road down the hill from the house. Potentially, power may be restored by later this evening. Possibly. Given that one of the engineers told <s>Mum</s> my sources that they'd located the site of the fault 'by magic', I'm not sure I hold out much hope.

<b>ETA</b>: And lunch, in the end, consisted of an orange and an apple made entirely of sourness. Damn it. Not comfort food at <i>all</i>. ~hungers for toast and Marmite~

<b>EETA</b>: I'll shut up now, shall I? :D"

"event","Dear Body,

As you may recall, you had a flu jab in December. Therefore you cannot be coming down with flu. So I would like the shivering, dizziness and aching to stop now, please. 

Regards,

the Brain.

p.s. Just in case this turns out to be the onset of a relapse, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that you suck."

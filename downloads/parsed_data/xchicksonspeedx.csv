"event","So now that I have run out of options.  And my attempts to kill myself are stupid and hopeless because I do care about the few people I still do have left.  I am ganna just try to heal myself.  I don't know how I'm ganna do it...and I know this drugs method isn't really the answer...I am ganna try to focus more on myself.  I guess I'm just ganna have to put up with hurting a few people.  I'm not even sure if I'm really ganna hurt anyone at all really.  I'm high right now so maybe everything I write here is bullshit but it makes me feel better for the moment.  I am ganna talk to only the people I know care about me.  Amber is one.  Morgan I sometimes feel like does but I'm not really sure most of the time.  Laura sometimes care but she is really to rad for me.  She is one of a kind thats for sure.  Must be why we are drown to eachother ha. I use to be like her.  I need to get back to my old self.  I was about to give on up on highschool...again for a second damn time.  I know one year must be worth it though.  I probably won't go to college but thats not really what I want to do.  I want to travel all over the world.  Thats what I truely really want to do.  I know there has to be more out there than this hell I've been stuck in.  Even if its worse than here (*which i don't think is possible*)  I want to see everything I can.  Maybe its the only way I'm ever really ganna find someone who will stay with me.  Or maybe its the only way I can find someone I want to stay with and won't push away from me.  I've relized that that must be my problem.  All this time I've kind of blamed guys and everything but I think the real problem is me.  I jsut don't know it.  I'm not sure but thats what im really starting to think.  So I'm ganna change that too.  My first step will definatnly be getting out of here.  I have to finish highschool for that and that is ganna take a year.  Or maybe even a year and a half since ive aready manged to fuck things up with in the first three weeks =\  

Or maybe I just need to get high more often ha.

I don't know...but I know I will change and I will get out of Mississippi and I will never ever ever come back. 

I will be happy again =) and I will get back everyone...that I love and ever have loved....well most everyone."

"event","I wish I still had my brother.  I wish he still actually cared.  I don't want to be alone anymore.  I lied when I said I hate people...I lied when I said I don't want anyone to care.  The thing is I really need at least someone to really care.  I so scared.  I don't want to die alone.  I want my life back but no one wants me back in their life.     


I'm leaving.  I've already decided its all I can do.  I guess I have to live here for another year.  I'm not lucky enough to die so soon anyways.  Luck was never really on my side.  I get in horrible accidents and always get through them because of the fact I want to die.  Sounds horrible I know...and I wish it really weren't true but it is.  I don't even get hurt...

Why did Ashely have to leave me and go spend a year in Nevada.  She was where my life went wrong.  I was like her pet really.  She kept me safe and sheltered from the world.  when she left it threw me out into the world suddenly alone.  I've had to try to over come all my problems...and I failed.  I got braver but I messed up somewhere and screwed my life up.  I am sorry.  I am so sorry to everyone I've hurt...I should have been a better friend and I'm sorry."

It's just have no more close friends to talk to anymore....absoultly no one...and I am fine with that.  I have given up on friendships really....close ones....become close to someone makes things harder when you or they leave....I don't have any room left for heartache.  I really am fine with just being here in my house...I'm not ganna amount to much anyways...hell I can't even get and keep a boyfriend so marraige isn't looking good in my future...i will probably just live with my parents until i die in some freak accident which i prey for these days.  Believe it or not...i am absoultly fine with it.   I'm kinda just drifting back into my loner stage i guess...haveing little to no friends....not being able to feel comfortable in large groups of people...especially when I have absoultly no one close to me there....I guess its just better for me to be home all the time now...safer and just better.  I don't want new friends.  I fine with the memories i have of my old ones."

 I am growing fond of my hair.  I hated it for the lonnngest while but now its growin on me.  It's long now.  I no longer have my butch hair haha.  I ammm soooo tired of people saying I dye my damn hair blonde.   No i dye it pink and purple and red and brown...not black yet...everything cept my stoopid natural blonde.  I have dyed it in awhile though.  Color doesn't hold well in my hair it all washes out.  I do have dark roots though but thats natural.  My roots have always been dark and then when they grow out that lighten up...you want proof look at my baby pictures!!!  I didn't start dying my hair until i was like 12ish maybe 13...so explain the dark roots at age three people!!  anyhoo yeah...so umm I'm over that one haha.

So I'm listening to this Indie Rawk station its rad...to me anyways cuz i like indie fo sho lol.  Goodness Monday night was sooo funnn.  Me and Mike sooo Raved in Rae Raes room.  we put in come alice dj and dj irean *sp?* and it was sooo much fun.  I hate having guys stare at me while I do it but I mostly ignored Mark and had fun with mike cuz I haven't hung out with him since they moved.  Him and his boyfriend came over and saw with us.

We had fun swimmin monday too.  It was such a sausage fest in that pool me and laura with a bunch of penis's eewww its gross now that I think about it.  We played tag and Marko polo which is shitty cuz everyone knows I suuuck at those games so they gang up on me and my ass gets it evvverytime!  so then they fuck with me while my eyes are closed...but I have to be the good sport and keep my eyes closed lol...its fun but I'm all like grr errr pick on someone elllseee.   They only hit me with the noodles while my eyes are closed...no one else! haha its fun as hell though.

Sorry if this is a bunch of Random bullshit I am really bored and I'm tryin to figure out something to do so yeah I'm just talkin.  Luck your not on the phone with me haha cuz then you would have to hear me talk bout all this stuffs.

I talked to Joshie on the phone last night.  At home...it made me happy.  I love talkin to him at my house cuz then we actually kinda get to talk.  I didn't get any sleep last night because of my freakin kitten...he wanted to play alll night.  I mean there would be times where he would be sweet come up and give me kitten kisses which is sooo cute and cuddle with me for a little bit...but then he would go at it again making sure to wake my ass up...err hes such a cute little fucker!


Hmm so yeah Just wonderin...who all would miss me if I left and went to Mi. to live with Josh.  Rae said she would.  Alyson was kinda just mad at me about it.  Mike said he would.  I really don't think that many people would miss me much though.  Not really...I think they would just say they would but I hardly see anyone as it is... =\  well Ima go kick it with my indie rawk and stuff....later yall"

"event","Mr. Chubbs is the cutest kitten in the whooollleee entire world! He is always so freakin hungry though.  He woke me up at five in the morning trying to eat my fingers...so I got up walked through the house in my thong to get him some food...and my dad was up which pissed me off cuz I didn't want him to see my butt!  Hmm so yeah Mr. Chubbs makes me so happy I'm glad I got to keep him. He likes to watch the computer screen and he is shy around everyone here except me.  I guess cuz he's known  me since he was like born.  

It was so great.  I got to talk to my baby last night.  Just like we use to.  On my house phone in my bed.  It made me soo happy acctually getting to talk to him again.  I've been so sad lately...and part of the reason is because he just doesn't seem to be as interested in me anymore.  He told me last night it's because I live in longbeach.  He said he doesn't like talking to me when I'm around my friends.  He got kinda mad at me last night for being at Mitchies house.  I was so errr at his house I just really wanted to leave...so I called Joshie cuz I hadn't gotten to talk to him alll day and yeah I went outside to talk to him...but he was all err about it so yeah.  I guess I just won't call him when I'm with my friends.  He dosen't like any of my guy friends but thats understandable.  He said he would talk to me more if I move back home.  I miss him so much and one of the only things I ever even liked at home was gettin to talk to him.  It was the only thing here that made me happy.  So he would be one of the reasons I came back.  I love Rae and Laura though and they are soo good to me and they acctually seem to care about me...cept when I make them mad or something.  I just wish it didn't bother him.  You know me being over there. 

Well either way I'm unhappy.  I like being in longbeach with them...but I get really sad when Josh doesn't want to talk to me.  It's been driving me crazy the past week or two.  I love him and I don't get to see him so of course I want to talk to him.  Then on the other side I could come home.  Where I hate being and my parents make me depressed and I'm mostly alone.  I would get to talk to Josh at night though...I hope....it may just turn out the same way it does in longbeach...err I just don't know.  I love him and if he doesn't like talking to me there...oh well I still love him.

I'm ganna go look for food now because I ate one thing yesturday and now my parents are like you should have woken up and we would have gone and gotten something to eat but you didn't so we ate without you...maybe we will go get something later...errrrrrrrrr wtf........there isn't even anything to eat in the house.  noodles but i can't eat them without cheese....fuck this mothers day shit....Happy Mothers day to everyone else though...."

"event","Right now I'm stuck at Mitchies house.  I'm in a really bad mood and now hes pissed off at me because I snapped at him.  Sorry if I don't like people being all errr...I'm just ganna shut up about that.  I love Josh.  I wish he would call me.  I love the way he called me back when he said he was ganna that was pretty damn shitty.  So yeah casey called and I thought it was him cuz it was the boy ringtone *mr. brightside* and Josh is the only boy that calls me.  Well cept Jeremy and Jude but theirs are different...and yeah it pissed me off cuz it wasn't Josh and he just wanted to fucking talk to Mitchie.  Errr and on top of that all Joe ever does is fucking hit on me and see if he can get away with getting me to suck his fucking cock.  Sweet guy but yeah huge flirt espcially since I told him about Josh...of course he was like so what he lives in Mi....he was like you may love him but if he can't be here with you then he will just have to wait and give the guys here a chance....so yeah that just pissed me off more.  The other thing that was just fuckin whorish of him was that he was waiting for his girlfriend to call so he could go pick her up...while fucking around with me...errr I HATE BOYS!....hmm I got this emial from some guy named Dan in Iraq he said he was looking for some of his friends pictures on photobucket.com and ran into mine....it was really sweet he was like I usually dont do this and I'm not a stalker or perv but I wanted to let you know your beautiful.  I just thought it was really sweet.  Where as another one I got was some guy goin DAMN YOUR HOTT holla at me and check out my pictures...errr I fucking hate that...I dont even know how to look at complete strangers pictures...but i'm computer dumb so that would explain it.  I really wish I had Josh here with me....it makes me feel worse when I have to deal with guys hitting on me and my boyfriends is like all the way across the country.  Some guy named David or some shit came over...on of mitch and Joes friends...and he kept looking at me and saying how familar I looked...he didn't look familar at alllll....so then bam clued me in on the fact that he was hitting on me cuz most of the time I don't catch it...people just have to flat out tell me errrrrrrr...boys are fucking pigs!  I love Josh sooo much and I really don't want to be with someone else at all.  I really hope he feels that way too.  I want to leave so bad.  I am tired of being here cuz I'm really fucking bored and in a really bad mood...and if he didn't have this computer which he usually doesnt have....I would be even worse...ahhh I'm ganna go because I'm bitching to mucdh...I think I'm just ganna go back to longbeach tonight....errr tomorrow is Mothersday....so I have to stay home with my mommy....errr...I don't know what the fuck I'm ganna do...."

HCH had a big drop out rate how shitty is that poor skool.  Hmm anyhoo.  We are ganna go to J.D for a bit then move to Fl. and go to cosmo skool.  It's not really somthing I totally want to do but I figure its really one of the only options for me.  My mom did it her sister did it my cousin is doing it.  Hmm I guess it's just what I'm suposta do.  Until I find the man of my dreams and my pretty house in the south and have kids.  Well I have the man of my dreams already.  Maybe I can keep him that long....but I'm ok with keeping him for as long as I can because he is still young....but I really really love him and he knows that...hmm well I'm ganna go get a hottpocket and work on being in a good mood today...."

Awww it was little bit.  All the others have gotten big enough to jump out of the closet and she has been in there by herself for a few days poor baby.  So I went and got her out.  She is the runt of the litter.  She was sooo small it was sad.  Mrs. Beth had to nurse her back to heath cuz she wouldn't eat and she wouldn't move or anything she is bigger now but she just looks like the kittens did when they were younger.  I'm ganna be so sad when they take the kittens to the pet store.  

You know I feel stupid because of what I want out of life.  I mean all I really want is to live in a pretty house down south.  With a guy that loves me more than anyone in the world and two kids maybe three.  I want to be a mom more than anything...I mean of course when I'm older but yeah you know.  I just feel dumb because I now so many people who want like these awsome careers and stuff and I just don't have those kid of dreams.  I don't know why...makes me feel I don't know pethetic.  I'm not sure if I'm ever even ganna find a guy who will want to marry much less have kids with me.  

I hate my photobucket.  How do people I don't even know see it.  I keep getting emails about it....its just weird.  I don't know how to look at other peoples pictures.  It's mostly perverted guys that email me though...weird people...a few nice people though....I'm just to lazy to ever get on and delete it or whatever."

"event","I tried really hard all day to be in a good mood.  I really really did.  It didn't work for shit.  I give up. I get it god doesn't want me to be happy.  Something shitty always has to pop up.  Thanks god thanks for this oh so shitty life you have given me.  For all you fuckers who tell me I can't blame god.  Get over it at least I believe in him right.  Maybe I'm not even sure if I really do anymore.  I tried being a good person.  I tried doing the right things...keeping myself out of trouble.  Well fuck it...fuck all the bullshit I thought was right and fuck all the bullshit I tried doing...fuck my whole entire life.  I'm tired of trying to make everything work out so that I don't hurt other people when I'm still so fucking misrable inside...oh and yeah I think its already pretty damn clear that I can't spell for shit....I failed English sorry...just wasn't my thang.  I believe all those dick heads now...the ones who made it clear that I'm a dumbass whos only good to fuck and look at...I barely have looks going for me so yeah how shitty is that.  Fuck this whole live journal thang to...I'm ganna go buy a real journal and just stay away from computers...they are bad...and I hate them.  

I'm also giving up on boys.  oh by the way happy 4:20...cuz thats what time it is...here anyways.  I just waste my time and get even sadder with them.  I'm never ganna really have a guy who truly loves me.  If I do now I'm not ganna be able to ever really be with him...probably won't ever get to see him again.  I just waste my time trying to get his attention anyways...something I'm never ganna have.  I have never had to try to get a guys attention.  Never even cared or thought much about it...but for some reason with Josh its different.  I guess it's because of the way I feel about him.  It's just stupid I guess and I'm just ganna stop trying. They only pay attention to me when they are getting sex out of me or something.

I'm never ganna stop doing drugs everything always leads right back to them.  God I have a lot of anger in me right now.  I feel like I just want to beat the shit out of something but I can't cuz I don't like being violent. I wish I had what all my friends have.  A home that is actually theres and that they are happy in.  Someone who loves them and is always there for them.  Rae and Laura are two of the luckies people I know.  Even Bam and Ashley.  Err I just wish I could be more like them...even the way they think and live their lives...and for Ashley I wish I could be as smart as her.  God what the fuck is wrong with me.  Why do I have to change moods so rapidly.  Thats whats fucked up about my journals.  If you read threw them you can probably see how fast I change moods.  I change about twenty times a day going for happy sad depressed mad just ok...err its so fucking...just err...I can't stand living like this anymore.  I really really want to end it all but then again there will always be the side of me that can't stand hurting other people...its stronger than the care I have about myself.  I will always love everyone else more than I love myself there for I will suffer for everyone elses happiness.  Then again I don't see how me living makes anyone at all happy...I should have just killed myself a long time ago when I had the chance and the balls...Now I'm just a pussy who just kind of does nothing at all...err I hate how fucking pethetic I am.  Why can't I just like myself.  All I want is to be happy with myself but I can never find anything about me that is good.  I don't even understand what other people see in me.  Rae says I make her laugh...its only cuz I'm dumb and say stupid things.  Laura says its cuz I'm the only person who was ever there for her and stood up for her even when I didn't know her but it was only because I can't see other people hurt and for some stupid reason I have faith in everybody even when the fuck me over.  No matter how much a person hates me or does horrible things to me...I can never bring myself to hate them back....not even my dad.  Not even any of the guys who raped or molested me...I just can't because for some reason I always think they didn't really mean it and they just have their own problems they are dealing with and its just not their fault.  I guess thats why I'm hard on myself I take the blame for ever single thing everyone else does.  It's really starting to get to me really bad.  I'm holding in way to much and I have no way of letting it go...except writing I guess.  This is probably way to much for everyone to read but oh well only like two people even read this damn thing so I guess I just really don't give a fuck. 

You know I think Josh would have been better off if he had never even met me.  I'm just to much trouble to deal with sometimes.  I come with way to much emotional baggage.  I wish I knew what he sees in me.  I think he's losing the love anyways.  I wish I could let go of things easier.  Oh well I'm just ganna type all this shit and forget it anyways.  Thats why I get so depressed I keep it all inside to where even I forget I'm depressed then it all hits me suddenly and I remember everything and then I'm just screwed and in a bad mood for weeks and weeks until it goes back in.  It's really shitty.  ERrrrrrrrrr I hate wanting to die...its so mean.  

I love Josh.  I had a bunch of guys tell me I'm stupid for being in love with someone so far away.  It's only because they don't have a chance of using me like a dirty whore anymore.  How shitty is that.  I wish I could bring myself to stop talking about Josh so much.  I just can't help it though cuz hes on my mind all the time.  It probably makes me sound obsessed with him.  I wonder if he thinks that.  I don't know.  err I'm kind of feeling those pills now so I'm ganna go do something..."

I was just thinking about everything that was bothering me trying to work things out in my head.  I always thing better when I'm outside.  I started thinking about Josh and why it is that I love him so much.  I think it's because he's the only guy that has treated me the way he does.  I mean all guys can be assholes...even him at times...but most of the guys I know treat me like some dumb blonde thats only good to fuck.  I mean most guys call me stupid and fuck with me and they just errr it makes me so upset.  I mean yeah I'm slow but I can't help that I don't catch perveted comments and I don't understand sarcasm *spelled wrong i think =\* I'll admit I'm not the brightest person in the world...but I'm not completely stupid either.  I was told that I'm not very smart at all and I can't hold an intellegant conversation but at least I'm pretty to look at....I mean do people not think thats a little bit offending...Josh isn't like that though.  He fell in love with my personality where as no other guy seems to do that.  They go stright from hi to lets fuck...and if thats not true they sure as hell make it seem that way.  No one makes me happy the way Josh does...no one talks to me the way Josh does...and know one seems to care about me the way Josh does.  I guess I just want him to know that I don't love anyone else the way I love him and I never want to lose that.  I will allllllwayys be here for him.  cuz i really really LOVEEEEEE HIM!!...anyways just getting it all out hmmmmmmmm I'm ganna go play with everyone know cuz they are calling me....I think we are ganna go get some foods or something we dug up 10$ yay...I live in a house full of girls now lol..me, rae rae, laura, and summer....It almost feels like a shleter because raes parents just kinda took us all in lol...they are the most sweetest people i've ever met...they said they will take care of me for as long as I need them...and that they love me like part of the family...that makes me happy..."

I love him...I really really don't want to lose him.  I don't know what I'd do if I did because he is one of the only people left that can make me happy.  I love him sooo much.

I was ganna go smoke with some people...they asked me if it would make me feel better...but I decided not to because I quit doing that for good...I just woke up from a dream it was crazy...I was rolling my ass off lol...it was great except i wasn't suposta be rolling and yeah it was crazy this dood and this chick were trying to get me outta this big house it was a crazy fun dream...well for me cuz i was rollin haha...hmmm I'm not ganna do that anymore either though...well I'm ganna go talk to the others now so yeah bye yall..."

I guess I'm ganna move back home while I do that and see how all that works out.  It would make my mom happy so yeah.  It's just getting along with my dad that I'm worried about.  So yeah She gets out of skool in two weeks so she said she will help me as much as she can.  She might even let me bring home Mr.Chubbs or Jack.  Now I can't decide which one I want Jack is so layed back and cool but Mr. Chubbs is so cute and funnie.  I loooveee Kitties.  Hmmm I can't talk to Josh anymore during the day. My dad is mad about the phone bill.  I can only talk to him around seven my time but he's never home then and then he has to go to bed so yeah...I guess I just won't get to talk to him muchhh...so that sucks.  If I go back home I can but yeah I don't know depends on if he even wants to call me.   I am ganna miss Rae and Laura cuz I'm not ganna get to see them much when I go.  I will miss Summer too cuz I'm not sure if I will get to see her at all.  Well at least I can kinda get my shitty ass life stright...I'm still depressed maybe I'm just messed up in the head...I dont know.  I miss Josh a lot that kinda really makes me depressed.  I'm really really trying to think positive but I always think about not ever getting to see him again and that makes me sad...I'm always scared he's ganna like never call me again which would suck...I guess I'm just scared of being in love with someone and them not being in love with me back...Anyhoo yeah I really Love him...someone who lives on the other side of the country and is two years younger than me...and I love him sooo much...its just i dont know kinda crazy...but yeah oh well i'm a weird girl...I'm ganna go see what everyone is doing and try to get all my stuff together..."

We were in the pool for about three hours and then rae and laura came home and got us.  We ended up getting stright outta the pool, into the car, and to a wal-mart parking lot.  It was freezing!  I was in boxers *with only a thong on under them* and a shirt with no bra.  It was just errr cold.  We ended up being there for like three hours.  Me bam and rae just waiting in the parking lot for them to come back.  I though my nipples were ganna effin fall off lol.  Then Mr. Jeff gave me a blanket yay!...Well after that we grabed a bite to eat and came home.  We got all changed and chilled outside for a bit.  we all ended up coming in and going our seperate ways.  laura didnt feel good bam pkayed mario and i was irritated with people so i just layed down.  Rae was tryin to make me feel better so she put on the killers.  For some reason when im in a bad mood or something Mr. Brightside makes me cry.  Well then we all got playful again.  Me and Laura played with this pain reliver stuff that looked like a stick of glue and then me laura and bam played with tape.  Then Laura got up and played mario for a bit so rae came over...shane had just gotten there and he just chilled on the couch.  Well rae got a carton of ciggaretts *spelled wrong?* and i was bored and they made me feel bad because I couldn't figure out how all those packs fit in the box...I'm a bit slow...so rae goes just rip the box open and dump them on the bed, it will make you feel better lol...so I did...well there are ten packs in a carton...and i was bored...so i was just playing with them...i made a house haha...rae was like next she will be opening them to make little people for the house...Well next thing i knew me and rae were throwing them at eachother...ha...it turned into a war...she was iraq i was Amarica *why does that not look right to me...oh well*  so we bombed the hell outta eachother...we didn't mean to but we ended up draging amber and shane into it...bam being canada shane being afganastne *spelled wrong i know*  So rae ended up taking my teddy bear hostige....smuggling over to afganastan *shane* who was next to the bed on the couch...so i was like fine secret mission lol...i hoped the couch snatched the bear and did this nifty little hop back into my spot over in america...rae started to laugh her assss off because it just came outta no where....she was like leelee that was some 007 stuff right there...everything that was done in the war with me and rae just came outta the top of our heads it was so fun...I laughed harder than i have in like years last night...well anyhoo then laura got mad at us cuz she didn't feel good and we were being loud...so we stopped and watched family guy season two i think....they have seasons one and two on dvd...then shane went and picked us up some stuffed french toast....yummmmy...and yeah...then i crashed because i was sooo freaking tired last night...i think it was probably close to threeish...yeppers then i woke up around 12ish cuz josh called me...and yeah here i am...Josh has just been partying all weekend...he either smokes...or drinks now...the life i use to have...never though i would date someone and me be the sober one....its just weird i guess...I'm not sure if i like it...just makes me wanna go do it knowing that i cant and shouldnt...and well just wont....and yeah...i really dont want him to get hurt....i love him to much for him to be stupid...errr...im ganna go now..."

I am trying to get out of this huge shitty mess that I was stupid enough to get stuck in.  I won't go back to my parents though.  Not my dad anyways.  I just won't do it.  I hate the way he is.  He is an ass. Me and Laura talked last night.  She made me feel better.  They won't me to stay with them for awhile.  Until I turn 18.  I just feel like I'm imposing even though they have told me a thousand times that I'm not I still feel that way.  I am jealous of rae and laura.  Not like in a bad way.  I just miss having someone to love on all the time and stuff like they have.  Even if I didn't live with him like them.  I miss the physical part of a relationship *and im not just refering to sex*  I love Josh though so I'm not ganna go out and fine some guy just for physical relationship.  It just kinda makes me sad seeing everyone together and me being alone.  Which just makes me sound completely selfish.  I had a dream about working in petsmart well going to get a job there anyways and then this fish like jumped up and bit my hand.  It was this lesbian chicks favorite fish lol.

I no longer have and exciting life.  The only thing I really miss about living at home besides my doggie sophie....is getting to talk to Josh alone at night.  I'm never alone anymore.

"event","I went to bed at like four something in the morning again last night.  Goodboybuddy woke me up again this morning.  I had to get up this morning anyways because I need to get dressed and stuff.  I'm glad i took a shower last night so I don't have to do it now.  Me and Laura took showers at like two in the morning becaues we were bored.  We also watched tv together last night and laughed our asses off it was great.  I didn't really talk to Josh much yesturday but thats ok.  He has a life to so i can't expect to get him all the time.  I am about to go apartemnt hunttin with Sarahkins and Bamsie.  I am just bored so i thought i would come update...im gettin lazy now.  I got to hang out with Ashley for a little bit last night which was good.  I do miss her but yeah I do believe we have both changed a lot.  She wants to move in with us =\ i don't really know about that but ok.  Now everyone wants to move in with us.  I mean its ganna be me sarah Jeremy and in a few months Jessica and then in a year or so Julia.  Thats a bunch of people in one little place as it is.  Lastnight they were talking about gettin a house and having rae&Laura, Ashley&Tim, Sarah&Julia, Jessica&Mitch,  Jeremy and me. *the only noncouple*  I would feel all errr and sad because i would be surrounded by all those couples who get to see eachother all the time.  I would just feel lonely i guess.  Sounds like im bein a bitch but its not just that i also don't want to live with that many people all at once it would get crowded and kinda annoying.  Well anyhoo ima go eat and dress and yeah........"

"event","I loooooooveeeee Joshie and always will...even if i miss him more than anything in the world and it hurts like hell...i never wanna stop loving that kid...and im not ganna.  I am sorry for being all mixed up and moody last  night.  I want him to know i really love him and i really care about him and it makes me soooo happy the way he loves and cares about me.  I dont think he really understands how much he means to me.  Hes the only guy who gave a fuck about me whats so ever i dont think even scott cared about me as much as joshie does and thats why i loooooovvvvvveeeeeee him so effing much!  and this summmer i will get to see my baby again.  I am so happy i found him you just do not know.   As of right now i just can't picture my life without him in it.  I don't want a life without him in it.  He makes me happier than anyone...i dont know why but im sooo glad he does.  I still hate myself but as long as he loves me i will be ok."

"event","GAWD im so depressed right now...it sucks nutttttttts.  I miss way to many people all at once.  I miss my old friends especially ashley and amber.  I miss Joshie wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy way way too much.  I miss everyone at skool *besides the athorites* but i do miss Mrs. Smith bunches and bunches and bunchs gawd i wish i could have told her goodbye but i couldn't.  Stupid fucking counslor errrrrrr.  I feel like im buming off of rae and laura but they want me to stay and i dont know.  I dont miss my parents which makes me feel bad because i reallly really miss my dog sophie. and rae and tink rawk...and we love alyse soooo much and she couldn't ever be a bum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and don't let her tell yall that!!!!-laura&rAe that was them by the way they took over the computer.  I don't feel good and I don't feel like goin back and reading what they typed.  I have been fighting with Josh all weekend which upsets me.  I mean it's not really his fault.   It's mine for being a moody bitch.  I just I don't know I miss him so much it hurts.  I don't want to miss someone I love this much and errr.  Gawd I don't even know how I fell in love with him in the first  place.  I have such a hard time falling for guys i mean even getting crush and i fucking fell in love with this kid and err i just dont know how it happened.  Why the fuck would god do this to me.  I have been trying to go to church and everything latelly and err its not helping me at all.  I just had another sooorta fight with Josh...gawd i know exactly what it is and i hate myself soooooooooo much for it.  Its kinda just hitting me...this live jouranl really helps think i guess.  I am scared and i guess its like the same thing that happened with scott.  Except this time its worse.  I love him more than i loved scott and him being so far away is killing me so...even though i dont mean to...im slowly pushing him away....i guess i figure if i help him gett over me at least he will be happy and unattached...i care more about their feelings than me even if i do get hurt by it.  err i dont really know how to explain what i mean.  I hattte missing him but i love him soooo much gawd you just dont know hell i dont even know..........errrrrrrr......im so confused and depressed and mixed up....i love him i really really do...more than i should i guess.  i just dont want to miss him anymore but at the same time i dont really want to lose him or let him go because of how much i love him.  I've been looking for someone like him but now that i have him i dont realllly get to be with him and that sucks.  God *if there is such a thing* really likes making my life messed up.  Well no i can't blame god i like making my life messed up i guess...............errrrrrrrr it all comes down to i fuccking hate myself and yeah thats it the end."

"event","okay so Im being really annoyed by this guy online who doesnt just seem to understand the phrase ""no you cannot have my phone number"". I mean SERIOUSLY..whats so hard to comprehend that Im not gonna give you my number after just talking to you for 15 minutes. Whether you live 15 minutes, or 15 lightyears away. GOODNESS!

Well anyways, my friend shay came over last night, and we headed on over to another friend (jessie's) party. it was pretty fun, I drunk some, but not a lot..shay doesnt drink, so she played the disignated driver, except with my car,lol. I danced with this guy who was sexy as hell...but I could tell he was one of those porn recruiters cuz he kept making comments like 'your face structure is perfect'...'omg look at your curves'...'your calves are amazing'....and living in Cali, you learn how to tell the 'film directors'..from the '<i>film directors</i>...and thats what he was. A <i>film director</i>. They amuse me though..cuz they try to use every line to get you to come to their studio, and 'audition'..aka fuck them and their crew. Pathetic.

I went swimming this morning, and when I got out carmen had made me and dad some chocolate waffles (the absolute BEST waffles ever)...they're mine and my dads favorites, but of course my dad wasnt even home to eat them, so of course..being the greedy pig that I am, I ate them,lol

Im leaving for Vegas tomorrow night, or early morning Saturday to spend about 4 or 5 days. Vegas is always a party, so I know We'll have fun. Its gonna be me,jason,lyndsay,paula,shay,mike,tony,jay,and lenny...we're definately gonna have an unforgettable 4th of July,haha.

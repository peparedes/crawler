Letsee, I like turtle cheesecake, the word that is...the stuff is good too, but I haven't had it for quite a while.  I've been trying to run again, which is always an adventure.  After about two hours of work at Domino's I always start to feel hyperactive.  Youth ministry still starts the eleventh, but it seems like most of my off days are spent doing something for the church (not a bad thing, just not always what I want to be doing)...AH...I completed the Vital Signs check off for nursaing school, so I haven't failed out yet, which is always a plus.  So that's my life.  I like to eat things that taste good, and also I like to smell things that smell nice.  I also like to touch things that feel nice, and look at things that look good. I don't really like to hear things that sound nice though...PSYCH!  BOOYAH!!"

"event","Let me clarify my last post.  It wasn't one of those ""Boo hoo no one loves me"" posts, although I dod admit that I might have had some of those feelings deep down inside, though I dismiss those because I know who my friends are, and I appreciate all of you.  I also know that all ""relationships"" are completely unneccessary at this point, though to that too I admit that at times I don't care.  All that is to talk of my last post.  As absurd as it may sound, that was spawned by watching the movie Bewitched.  I realized that throughout my entire life, on one level or another, I have been trying to be ""cool.""  This is all well and good, except for the fact that I am tragically uncool.  On Saturday night, I came to terms with that.  I will never be ""the cool kid,"" and if I can ever succeed I can never keep it up.  And if I keep it up I will never be comfortable.  So, practically applied, specifically in the context of male/female relationships, I am looking for a girl that will be impressed with how unimpressive I am.  It's not a bad, self pity thing, it is one more realization about life, and what I'm looking for.  Thanks for listening, much love..."

"event","<P>So I suppose it's time for my monster of an update about the trip to the Bahamas. So, everyone, buckle in, and here we go. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Bahamas Excitment...""> </P>
<P>So, lets start off at the beginning.&nbsp; Staff training week, was incredible, as it always seems to be.&nbsp; God really makes a group tight whenever they gather together to serve him.&nbsp; After that week, it felt like I was saying goodbye to old friends when I left the Quebec team.&nbsp; That's pretty much all that happened that week.</P>
<P>So, the first week of ministry.&nbsp; This was probably my favorite week as far as getting to know the students went.&nbsp; The ministry was, I'll be honest, not as strong as I might have liked, but the group themselves (as much as the leaders hated Crossover) was a blast.&nbsp; I still, 100 names and a month and a half later, remember almost everyone's name, which is quite the accomplishment for me.&nbsp; In addition to the great group and interesting ministry opportunities, there were bugs.&nbsp; Not just a few bugs, but there were BUGS.&nbsp; In fact, I was eaten alive, and....well, never mind, I won't go into that.&nbsp; So, that was the first ministry week in a SUPER abridged version (I'm counting on only Jess and Blair to care enough to read this entire thing, and I figure you know what happened :)).</P>
<P>Alrighty then, on to the two weeks until the next team.&nbsp; We connected with the other Bahamas team again, and said goodbye to Jimmy, then we embarked on a rather terrible week in that we only did enough work to make us dread working, but not enough to feel like we'd accomplished something.&nbsp; After a week of that we made it to the off week at Paradise Cove.&nbsp; Praise the Lord for that...Paradise Cove is one of the most fantastic places on Grand Bahama.&nbsp; Not only is it beatiful, but they also have a pretty spectacular coral reef.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I'm going to have to take a minute here to explain to you all about the people I was staying with.&nbsp; More specifically the guys.&nbsp; Matt was the site coordinator for the other site, and while he's a quiet guy, whenever he does open his mouth he's most likely being sarcastic, and he's so serious about it you can sometimes not tell.&nbsp; John also was there, and he's is one of the coolest people I know.&nbsp; We decided to go crabbing one day (Sherlin taught us how, and it seemed easy enough) and we drove up and down the highways for about an hour, not seeing anything.&nbsp; So finally Matt slams on the breaks because he saw a crab, so we all pile out to take a look.&nbsp; This crab was about the size of a big toe.&nbsp; How he ever saw it is beyond me, but we proceed to use our expert Bahamian crab-catching techniques (picking them up and breaking off their legs) on this miniscule crab.&nbsp; As if that wasn't bad enough, we actually filmed part of it, and we showed off to the girls when we got back...Such is what we did...for we are losers...:)</P>
<P>It is time to move on to the third ministry week, which was only the second week we had a team.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a mixed week, because half of the group was really cool, but half were from a richer church, and were a bit more exclusive, I suppose the polite way to say it is.&nbsp; This week was very well organized, because by this time Greg, who is actually in charge of Crossover short term missions and a veteran at leading trips, arrived and also it was in a city this time, as opposed to the country, and logistics fell into place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part as service leader,&nbsp; there was a house that belong to a family in the church and was completely shelled out, so we reroofed part, we reframed part, and we put up siding.&nbsp; The kids were hard workers, and we got almost all of it done, and out of the four ministry days we worked past quitting time on three of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ministry wise this was a good week.&nbsp; Relationally, it was mixed.&nbsp; As I said, about half of the group was phenomenal, but the other half was a constant battle to try to get them to do anything.&nbsp; Probably the highlight of this week relationally was the fact that I managed to convince parts of that team that I was 1) the father of three children and 2) married to Avril Lavigne (neither of which are true, in case you don't know me so well).&nbsp; </P>
<P>The final ministry week was probably the best as far as ministry opportunities go, but probably the worst as far as getting to know the students.&nbsp; I had about four or five sites that I had to keep running smoothly, so I never really had the chance to dig in and work with the students like I generally try to do.&nbsp; I learned a lot about myself and my weeknesses that week.&nbsp; Like how I really need to be more organized.&nbsp; The group itself seemed like they were cool, but I was so consumed with running to the hardware store and coordinating jobs for the next day I probably only spent about an hour a day talking to students.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So, now I'm back in the states, and I have a meeting with my pastor tomorrow morning about maybe taking control of the youth group for the next couple of years.&nbsp; I need your prayer on this, because if you stuck it out through this email, you probably care enough to remember to pray for me.&nbsp; I've never really taught high/middle schoolers before, so it's completely foreign to me, and I have to trust that if God wants me there (which I think he does)&nbsp;that he will give me the abilities which I believe I lack.&nbsp; So, that is my summer in a nutshell, I hope you enjoyed it, and I love you all.&nbsp; God bless...</P>

Me and Steven (Ed's little brother)  turned out to be crazily alike, so it was a whole bunch of fun hanging out with him while Ed was at school and work.  I also watched the United States beat Panama 3-0 on thursday at one in the morning.  Very exciting, and I believe that I am worse at tennis than I am at volleyball, which is...interesting, I suppose.  I played a whole bunch of Mario 3 this week, which was pretty amazing.  Other than that, pray for me, wish me luck, and God bless."

Us team fans, however, are constantly thrown up and down in the tempest they call a sports game.  Now, the reason I say this is that after being down by three, then two overtimes and a penalty shootout, LIVERPOOL WON THE CHAMPION'S LEAGUE!!!  HOORAY!!!"

A flash of red, a sweet caress,
And I know that I am truly blessed
To be here in this place tonight,
Among the tiny flick'ring lights
Knowing not so long ago
I almost missed this precious glow;
Distracted by so many things,
By vain pursuits and earthly flings.
But all the time you waited here,
To take the pain and wipe the tears,
That so often I'd refuse to cry,
Almost never knowing why.
My eyes are wet, my heart is broken
Before one word is even spoken. 
Your blessings fall like morning dew
These times I come to meet with you."

On a lighter note, my dreams this week have been amazing.  Pope, you were riding on the backs of sharks in one of them (Kristin Swanson and Megan moore were there too), Ashante, you've made an appearance in two of mine, and we tried to steal a boat to see the characters of napoleon Dynamite live...Beck, you were also in two of mine, and I remember you calling a girl ""pudgy"" :)...Josh, you also made an appearance, but that was at the start of the week, and I don't remember why.

Uncle Bruce: Hey, salad's buy one get one free, you want some?
Me:Sure, salad is fantastic.
UB:Oh, wait, only spinach is buy one get one free.
Me:I like spinach, let's get it.
UB:I don't like spinach.
Me:Ok, that's cool, let's not get it.

"event","So, I haven't updated for a while, so let me fill you in on a few details.  First off, all my exams ended ok.  The one I thought I failed I ended up with an A on.  Thank the Lord for His mercy and for grade curves.  After that, we ventured east on that bastion of humanity known as I 10 and arrived in Jacksonville.  After that, we went to Daytona.  Now, here is where our story truly begins.  After having the most wondrous sleep of my week we went to the flea market.  Now, you might be thinking that there's nothing cool about flea markets.  Well, o doubter, you have never been to the Daytona flea market.  Never has there been a more schlarny collection of odds and ends under the sun.  So, my mom bought a gripper flipper from the As Seen on TV store, in and of itself enough to make you want to dance, and I bought not only a 50 cent ""Purity"" wristband (a ripoff of livestrong) which has already broken, but I also bought a videogame for $13 (in which I just got married and lost my virginity...HOORAY FOR ROB!!!)

So, now I'm going to break, and continue on so it looks like my post isnt so long.  Ha ha, I decieve you again!




I'm just playin'....but I got you though....

So.  My brother is now an officer in the United States Navy (Woot for Eric)  and that was pretty much it.   It was during this time which I wrote my last post.  Now, I'm a little hyper right now, and a lot happier.  Basically, a good day's hard work restored my motivation, and I love Jesus this much<

>.  That much.  Maybe more... So, that is my life, minus some minor details concerning the beach, submarine sandwhiches, and slivers (a picture of that to come tomorrow, hopefully).  I bid you all adeiu, and I love you.  Yes, you."

"event","So...  I haven't updated in a while, figured it was about time to do so.  Jeff had his surgury, and is doing well.  My driver's liscence should be back soon (the bank sent it to the wrong car).  School is amazingly dumb, I have all of my projects coming up in the next week.  In spite of that, however, I had a lovely day.  I went to lab, which was boring, came home, tried to sleep, but couldn't.  So, after laying in my bed for a half hour, I decided to go outside and work on our garden.  So, we revamped our pond, planted many plants, pulled many weeds, and got a wee bit of a sunburn.  Why is that lovely, you ask?  Because I am insane, and enjoy that.  I can already tell that by the time that I hit his age I will be unwilling to spend time indoors during daylight.  Until then, however....;)

So, right now, we just finished watching the Spurs get creamed by the Mavericks, and I was reading ""Slaughterhouse Five""  by Kurt Vonnegut.  That is the wierdest book I have ever read.  I also saw Spanglish last night, which was surprisingly good.  The Mexican girl reminded me of someone I know, though, so maybe I was biased by that.  Good stuff.  Later."

I went to BCM, always a good idea, and the message tonight beat-down convicted me, and the guy that spoke was absolutely amazing.  It was on holiness as Christians.  And he was so right.  So many Christians live exactly like their surroundings, and I'm by no means innocent of this, but THAT IS NOT THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.  We are out of the world!  So why do we try so hard to fit in?  We shouldn't.  Our atypical lifestyle is our main witness.  Goodness if I couldn't keep this clarity all the time, the devil himself couldn't stand a chance.  Luckily for him, I am a spiritual whore who is distracted by the smallest shiny object.  God please help me keep focus on this.  Please pray for my brother, y'all, he goes into surgery for his shoulder tomorrow, and while it's not dangerous, this is the second time for the same problem.  Ok, God bless."

"event","Hey you guys...I'm back.

Letsee, not too much is going on here.  Yesterday we worked outside after getting a nice chance to sleep in, both of which were amazing much needed changes.  Soon we're going to fix the fence so we can keep the dogs out of our garden again.  Today I had a Russian girl shadow me at school, which was fun, I suppose.  I felt kinda bad, because I kept seeing people I knew, and although I always introduced her and tried to keep her involved, I couldn't help but think she might not have been having the best time.  It didn't help that my classes are boring as anything.  I gave her an old-school micheal w smith cd, though, so that was exciting.  

I've decided that whether you really are or not, speaking fluent spanish makes a girl pretty.  It's just such a good language...

And I saw Rebecca Mullen! It was Cahrazzy!  But, like I said, I was with the Russian girl, so I felt bad talking a long time, but it was good to see her.  Also, a girl gave me two of the biggest compliments I've gotten for a while 1. I gave good hugs and 2.I smelled nice. :)  It may or may not be true, but it made me feel good.  Ok, ummmm, love y'all, later."

"event","So, I'm back in Pensacola, praise God who is indeed merciful.  It's kind of ironic that after driving across the country safely, some moron pulls right out in front of me and we narrowly avoid a wreck a mile and a half from my home (I only call him a moron because I was tired and grumpy at the time.)  The final ride home was rather dismal, sadly, and when it was my turn to drive, I got so sick that I sneezed often, my eyes were watering so bad it was like I was crying, and I just overall wanted to sleep for a very long time.  Have I slept yet though? No.  Don't ask me why.  So, to summarize the trip to those of you who weren't there:  Spring break was definitely a good idea, whoever invented it gets mad props; me and Josh were definitely the only reason for any scoring in volleyball; the grand canyon is aptly named; ""naughty pillows"" is in fact a medical term; Sedona, while it may be a hippie hangout, doesn't hold a candle to Costa Rica in natural beauty; I'm terrible at pretty much every card game ever invented (but Beck is worse at spoons ;)); ummmmmmmmm, actually that's most of what happened in Arizona.  I've also decided that were I young and carefree, I would definitely move to El Paso, or some similar place, just because it is that cool.  In case you were wondering about the title, Josh bought me some super emo cd, and I actually like it, but I still hate Emo."

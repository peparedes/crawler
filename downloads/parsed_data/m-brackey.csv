"event","<p>Ok so I set up my livejournal account like 3 months ago and I forgot about it. Then today at work during a slower time I was surfing the web and I rememebered. So I was like I should write something. And here I am.<br /><br /><br />I dunno about first posts. You ever notice whenever you start a new blog or something like xanga or myspace your first post is always the same innane&nbsp;bulls**t you always type?<br /><br />So here I am thinking of how to word that same old innane&nbsp;bulls**t into a more interesting form. Its not going so well...<br /><br />I'm boring.&nbsp;I work. I eat. I sleep. Thats the major extenet of my life.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm in a very good committed relationship that is causing me to move 1,600 miles away from where I live now this upcoming September.<br /><br />I play World of Warcraft daily. Have been for the past two-ish years. Its addiction is worse than cigarettes which I smoke regularly.<br /><br />There is more I could say. But those who are&nbsp;probably reading this already know me well enuf.</p>"

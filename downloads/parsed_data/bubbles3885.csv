"event","Haha ok, steve and sarah:) no more fighting over my name:) sarah, I love you and you can always call me kylie, however, my name really is Kyle. Its not that Im coming back as a different person, I just have grown up some (or i like to think so) and like my name now:) But please call me whatever will make ya'll happy:)oh yes, and side note, I am very glad to be bringing ya'll back into dialogue again:)Ok so lets see..... Lots has happened since I last wrote. One thing i should probably clarify is no, i am not dead or anywhere close. I did end up in the hospital last week but its all ok now. They think that it is my gallblader and that it may have to come  out, but its kinda a useless organ anyways:) so no worries there:)
I have also started to realize how much college really does teach everyone. I know that I have learned soooooooo much from going through all of the experiences that I have so far. One, i actually learned today when i was talking to my sister. Pretty much, when it comes to relationships, one of hardest things to do is walk away from them. I think the only way that it is possible to do so, is to know that you gave it your all. If you did, and it still doesnt work, then there is no room for regret. But until you give it everything you have, you shouldnt give up. With that said, my sister and i decided that we had both done that. So, we came up with the conclusion that if the person that you care about cares about you, at some point, maybe not right now, they will figure out a way to make things ok again. Yea so thats my sister and I's first philosophy:)Second one is pretty short and doesnt require that much explanation. Some of the best ideas and possibilities are the unrealistic ones:) Yea
Umm soo besides that, I will OFFICIALLY be home this time in 3 weeks! soooooooooooooooooooo excited!!!! Well thats all for now:) Luv ya'll"

We have gone through a lot together. I am looking forward to seeing you again and to getting to know you all over again. And Sean A. You are such an amazing friend:) I feel sorry for whoever we challenge and beat in beer pong:) We're gonna have lots of fun together. 
Ok and yea, so I found a new song that I absolutely love!! Thank you Steve for introducing it to me:)Tell me what ya'll think.

You can be anything
Anything that scares you

I've been here before, but only my myself, myself.
I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you now
I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you ... now
What giving up gives you
And where giving up takes you
I've had and I've been here
In center frame
Here
There's only air
And just enough space to fit
I promised I'd see it again
I prmoised I'd see this with you now
I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you.. now
I said said said said it out loud

"event","Well, for some reason, I have decided that during the summer, when im supposed to have a lot of spare time, I really didnt have time to do this thing, and now in school, I do;-) Oh well. So, now where do I begin. Im at ASU again this semester, but as my sarah put is so eloquently, ""the bitch is going to Italy"":) I love you hun. I am gonna be in Florence next semester. Thats gonna be an adventure. I have also decided that while I am out there, Im gonna go bridge jumping( if anyone of ya'll has seen chasing liberty, you know exactly what Im talking about). Umm.. oh yea, BIG news for those who do not already know. My parents are back in Toledo, for good this time:) No way! They got to our house this past Sunday. I dont know the address yet, but when I do i will let all of yall know so you can come and visit:)(either my family or when im back for thanksgiving).And yes, I know most of my friends remember the Pug:) he is there now and may look a little bit different than last time you saw him. Hes a lot fatter. 35 lbs to be exact. Yea and we've tried that whole diet thing and its just not working. Oh oh oh and we have a newer member of our family. Riley, who is a female rotty and is the sweetest girl you will ever meet. Not really a guard dog, but no biggie:)Oh and i do have my new house number in case any of yall want to harras my parents:) its 4195781182. Anyways, school is going really well, as usual a lot of work though. But its worth it. I did decide, and you guys should be happy to hear this one, that Im not gonna date assholes anymore. I think i've had enough to last me a lifetime. And my original plan was to just have fun and date around (again, props to my sarah) but then of course right about the time you think that is gonna go according to plan, you meet someone who is amazing:) So yea, Kyle has to behave herself now, but it shouldnt be that hard. He keeps me on my toes:) Umm.. let me say hi to all of you guys that I really reall yreally miss and cannot wait to see again (those in Ohio and in Cali). My sarah, my sarah, I dont know what I would do without you. Out of all my friends, you have known me the longest.

Bob, thousands and thousands of interesting conversations that I will never forget and look forward to having again. Thanks for being an incredible friend. Ok, now for cali peeps. Christina, we've gone through hell and back and a few times over again. But that is why I love ya. Millions of nights out, drunk and sober, talking about everythign from guys to life. Security guards that talk more than we can:) I love you hun! and i will be out to visit soon:) Val, you're the first one i met out in cali and you're the one who made me feel at home. All of the nights of talking and entertaining, our trip to hawii, which will forever go down in history.

Thanks for everything.Teaghen, you're another one who we have gone through a lot together. But im soo glad that it has brought us closer. You know im always here for you if you need to talk about anything. Brendon, hah I think you deserve a catagory of you're own. I bicker with you more than anyone, but its all in good fun(usually;-) Im gonna miss you soooo much! Im gonna have to find someone else to bring me ice cream,look at the stars with and fix my flat tire next time i get one. You really are an incredible person. Dont let anyone ever tell you otherwise.

"event","Light breaks underneath a heavy door 
And I try to keep myself awake 
Fall all around us on our hotel floor 
And you think that you've made a mistake 
And there's a pain in my stomach from another sleepless binge 
And I struggled to get myself up again 

I wanna hang onto something 
That won't break away or fall apart 
Like the pieces of my heart 

And globes and maps are all around me now 
I wanna feel you breathe me 
Globes and maps I see surround you here 
Why won't you believe me? 
Globes and maps they charter your way back home 
Do you wanna leave or somethin? 

And dreams came around you in a hazy rain 
You opened your mouth wide to feel them fall 
And I write a letter, from a one-way train 
But i don't think you'll read it at all 

And globes and maps are all around me now 
I wanna feel you breathe me 
Globes and maps I see surround you here 
Why won't you believe me? 
Globes and maps they charter your way back home 
Do you wanna leave or something? 

And I can't take this anymore 
Well I know that I can't take this anymore 
I can't take this anymore 
Cuz I know someday I'll see you walk out that door 

And globes and maps are all around me now 
I wanna feel you breathe me 
Globes and maps I see surround you here 
Why won't you believe me? 
Globes and maps they charter your way back home 
So Do you wanna leave? Do you wanna leave? 
Globes and maps they charter your way back home 
Do you wanna leave or somethin?"

Summer is just beginning and I have already had some amazing times. We went to a Hooka ( i think thats how you spell it) bar last night and it was like a reunion with several of my old friends from my second high school. My sister came with us, and since she had never smoked a hooka before, our entertainment was her for a lot of the night. We then went back to one of my guy friends apartments and hung out their for a little bit. I miss all of my Ohio friends!! I hope everything is going well for all of ya'll. I dont know when I will be back again, but I will take the time to make a trip out there soon. Its really hard to believe our freshman year of college is over!!!! I personally dont feel that much older, but i know i have grown up a lot and its kinda fun:) Well.... thats all for now! I'll write again soon:) Muah!!
Mood: Happy Happy Happy Life is wonderful:)"

I know that I've said this before, but this time I mean it
You where right when you said that you where the only one who could catch me, 
You where right when you said that by the time I realized what I was letting go, you would be gone
You where right when you told me I would never fall in love again
You where right when you said that I would never let anyone get close to me
Bottom line, you where right.
I'm done hiding it. I'm done acting like everything is ok. 
If you want to hate me, all Im gonna do is let you. 
If you want to listen to other people, then go ahead. 
I will keep going forward, but now what I realize is that you are the only one who can catch me."

"event","Omg I think I might have a new favorite band:) Here's some of the lyrics! tell me what ya'll think:)
I cant imagine, all the people that you know, and the places that you go, when the lights are turned down low, and I dont understand all the things you've seen, but im slipping in between  you and your big.... dreams. Its always you, in my big dreams. And you tell me that its over, wake up lying in a patch of four leaf clover and your restless and i'm naked, you got to get out, you cant stand to see me shaking.. oh.. would you let me go? I didnt think so... and you don't want to be here in the future.. so you say the present is just as pleasant, an eruption to the past, and you don't want to look much closer, because your afraid to find out all this hope, you would send into the sky.. crashed, and it did because of me.. and then you bring me home, afraid to find out that your alone and I'm sleeping in your living room, but we don't have much room to live. I have these dreams and in them I learn to play guitar, maybe cross the country, become a rockstar. Yhere was hope in  me that I could take you there, but damnit your so young oh I don't think I care. and if I hurt you, then i'm sorry. Please don't think that this was easy. then youd bring me home cuz we both know what its like to be alone and I'm dreaming in your living room.. we don't have much room to live. And konstatine is walking down the stairs. Doesnt she look good standing in her underwear. and I was thinking, what I was thinking, but we've bene drinking and it doesnt get me anywere. my konstatine came walking down the stairs and all that I could do was touch her long blonde hairand ..i've been thinking, but it hurts me to th ink that these nights that we've been drinking never got us anywhere. no..this is because i can spell confusion with a K and i can like it. its to die in anothers arms but y i had to try it, its the jimmy eat world and those nights in my car, when the first star i see may not be a star, i'm not your star, isnt that what you said, what you thought this song meant. and if this is what it just takes to lie with my mistake, no matter what i did to you, all the hell i put you through, now you want to talk, its not hard to dream, you'll always be my konstantine. They'll never hurt you like i do. no...  you got into my head you with all the pretty things you did. Did you know i miss you.. did you know i miss you did you know i miss you?
I love this song!! it is amazing:)"

My mom just told me a story about my pug ( i love that dog) and it is hilarious, so i figured that i would share:) Ok so my mom is sitting on the sofa with my pug, and my dad is sitting in his chair watching tv. My dad went to jk toss the remote at my mom and close to the pug without really hitting him of course. So when my dad went to go through the remote to the side of the pug, for some unknown reason, pug got up at that exact moment and moved straight intot the tv remote. It hit him square in the head and he jumped off the couch, pissed off at my mom bc he thought that she threw the remote at him and went and sat on my dads lap. Except for when he was walking over to my dads chair, he was kinda weaving a little bit bc he had just gotten hit in the head with the remote. I was dying when my mom told me that story:)"

"event","K, first i'm sorry that I have not been that good at keeping up with this thing. This week has been ridiculous with school and stuff. Luckily, I only have one more test and thats tom ( i'm spending all day today studying for it). Anyway, Over this past week, and year I guess, I have come to realize and learn sooo much.  Before I left for school, everyone kept telling me that you grow up the most in college and you learn the most about yourself by going through the experiences college presents. I never realized exactly how much i was going to learn, both academically and emotionally. The first thing I learned is that no matter what happens in my life, people that I love and care about are going to be there to help me through it ( the people in m bubble). Before I thought that something college was supposed to teach was how to stand on your own. If you 'fell', you were supposed to be able to pick yourself up again, or at least learn how. Although this is true, and i have accomplished some things this year that i never even thought to be possible, it is important to have people in your life that will be there for you too. Another thing that i learned is what truly loving someone means. It means that you where to be half way around the world, and you got a phone call from someon you loved saying they needed you back here, you would get on a pland and go, no questions asked. It means that if you could take away all the pain someone would feel for the rest of their life and put it on yourself, you would do it. And lastly, if it means being physically there for someone forever, or walking away from them, you will do it because you know thats what they want and need. Finally, one of the most important things that i learned this year is to follow your heart and your passion, because it will never lead you wrong:) Muah"

So three weeks or so go by and when i was at the grocery yesterday, I walked by the coffee and decided that I had to have it. So this morning, I think i missed it more than i realized because i had three pretty big cups of it and then headed to class. and for some unknown reason, i thought that it wouldnt affect me. Yea well .. i'm still feeling it and sitting through my classes was interesting for anyone who was around me. :) wow anyway. another thing, we came up with a game called Kyle Win's and some people are chosing to not listen to the rules. Rules are very simple. I win:) Some people are under the common misconception that these rules are bias or unfair, but ahh what can you do:) oh and yea, quote of the day, "" all work and no play makes for an unhappy penis."" copyright is very important:) ok, i'm really done now, i swear. So lets see, what else...... oh yea.. i talked to ben brier for the first time in years last night. He used to be one of my good friends, but things got complicated, you know how it goes. He has changed a lot and really glad that I am able to get to know him as a person again:) I am soo incredibally happy to get to go home in a little more than three weeks. I never thought that college was going to be this much of a challenge. dont get me wrong, i love being out here, i love the people, and i love working hard in school ( yea i know im different:) but I miss my family soo much. Also, college is a different playing field on several aspects. Some of the stuff tha comes with it, i guess as far as different pressures go, i'm really done with dealing with. Why the hell is it such a big deal that i wont or havent done certain things. I like who i am and im not going to change for someone who is not worth changing for. With that said:) and on a happier note, i think i am going to a diamond backs game on friday with one of my friends! Yea!!!! i love live sports:) So yea, i think thats pretty much it for right now. I'm going to try to keep everyone posted as much as i can in the next few weeks, but your gonna have to work with me because its finals and projects and tests and all that good stuff:) Muah"

I have made some amazing friends that have especially recently, helped me through some interesting situations. I have been dating people off and on, some have been around longer than others, but have just decided to not see anyone else until I get back home to Cali. Mainly the reason I have decided to do this is bc, and anyone who knows me well will know this, I can't get past people lying to me. I have never been treated like that in the past, and have not intention of being with someone who is going to do that to me in the future. But anywho, on a happier note, i'm going back to California on May 13th and am sooooooooooooo excited!! I cannot wait to see my mom, dad, and sister and of course my puppies(Riley and Pug whom by the way is now 37 pounds, the little porker):) School has been going well but I am def. ready for it to be over and to work over the summer!

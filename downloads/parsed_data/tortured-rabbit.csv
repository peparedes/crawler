"event","So my aunt threw a birthday party for this girl Skola last night and it was also jam night. In other words, great live music, lots of chips, and lots of booze. Pretty much hung out with these three actors the entire time. Shannon, Grey, and Chuckle Slut. Cant remember his real name...One of the two keyboard players, the new one, got so drunk and I got to take care of him all night. Someone had dragged him into the woods...so Grey, myself, and keyboard guy number one, Brad, had to drag him up to the deck. They sent me to get pillows, and water, and cool towels for the poor guy. Shannon said, ""Okay, heres your lesson for the night. Party like this,"" and he gestures to all the musicians and actors, ""not like this,"" and pointed to the keyboard guy. And I ended up changing my shirt three times. Its crazyness. This one girl, whos name I do not remember, said to the guys, ""We need to sneak her more booze."" She knew how old I am. So after they passed a flask to me a few times, they asked how old I was. They all turned around and put their heads in their hands. It was awesome. All in all though, it was a good night. Even though I did have to take care of a puking drunk from 12:30 to 3:10."

Imperfections were swarming all around her, smothering her like locusts. She watched these people-people in name only-drink and smoke, living as if it was their last day on Earth. She watched these ""people,"" hoping to find one of them that was her complete opposite. Boys and girls went by, until she finally found her prey. A girl, of maybe sixteen. She was chubby with freckles across her face. Her rainbow shoelaces said it all. My china doll threw down her beer, took her hand, and led her to an empty bedroom. Not saying a word. She found an imperfection. That could make her real. At long last."

"event","I have finally been allowed back into my house without any threats of being sent back to the hospital. Let me explain.

Monday morning, my mother and I got into a huge fight. I, being the pussy I am, started crying. She decided I should go to the hospital. She called my dad and tried to get him to take me there because she had a ten o'clock appointment. Instead, he picked me up and took me to work with him. Later that day I went and got some clothes. I spent the night at my grandfather's because my dad and my stepmom got into a fight over me. The next morning, my mom called and said she was going to come and get me. So I called my dad. Of course, she was planning on taking me to the hospital. He talked her out of coming to get me. (she had also called Sica to see if I had been cutting, which I had not been) That night, I stayed at my dads. He let me go spend the day with Sica Wednesday because I had nothing to do at his house. We ended up going to see Fantastic Four which didn't suck. Then back to dad's. Mommy Dearest was still wanting me to go to the hospital. Stayed another night there. One of my contacts had fallen out so I called dad to see if I could run by mom's to get another one. He said just pack up my shit and go. So, called mom, asked if I was allowed back in the house. She asked if I had a key. So, here I am. I don't know if she is still set on putting me back in Children's psych ward or not...but it's all okay. Because I have people who care about me enough to come pick me up and prevent that from happening. My dad only did it because:
1. He doesn't think she should throw me in there because we got in a fight
2. He doesn't want to pay for it

So I've had a shitty week, really. So excuse me if I am rude."

"event","OHG!! Drew...took me out...in PUBLIC!! AHHH!!

So..Myles arrived with Scott and Drew around oh..6:30. We had to wait til my mom got home to leave cause she wanted to meet them. Who knows why. But eventually we left and stopped by Myles' house. They tried to make me hold fireworks in my mouth and light them. I wouldnt let them of course. Then off to MOES!! Everyone decided to climb out the sunroof...I would have but I was wearing my kilt...so that was out of the question for me. Once we were sitting in a booth with our food I pulled out the camera and made a video or two of Drew and Scott..and Sica when she pulled out a spork and made it a BAT SPORK! I wish I could upload it here but I dunno how. Anyway...Sica started trying to stab people and I got a spork and Drew broke it so I stabbed him with it...then nachos were thrown...people were staring...I was afraid we were going to be kicked out. But we werent, which is good. We walked around a bit...went and looked at the pets at Pet Smart. When we came out...THERE WAS ASS!!! I havent seen Ass since I was at DABBS. And I most definatly got his number.

<center><i> Stale incense and old sweat 
And LIES LIES LIES
It comes down to this
Your kiss Your fist
And strange, it gets under my skin</center></i>

Then we decided to cross the busy intersection rather than wait for Myles. And coming down the hill behind the movie theatre Scott tripped and fell and went SPLAT on the concret. I laughed. He got up like...three seconds later though. Crazy fool...Then they paid for our tickets (Sica and I got to keep all our money..hehe..such gentlemen..) Sica and Scott made a detor to the bathroom so Drew and I decided to hide in the theatre...It actually took them a while to find us...we were down low in the seats. I love me. Myles came in during the previews. Just appeared out of no where. Watched War of the Worlds. It was pretty good...cept for you know...TOM CRUISE!! I hate him...grr...Anyway. We got Myles to take us back to my house after the movie. It was crazy in the car...holy shit...I thought we were going to die. Ask one of us for more details. Stopped by Sica's, picked up a few DVDs...Then we came here. And watched the Led Zeppelin DVD that she had. And it was good. They (Scott and Sica) tried to smother me with a pillow..then they dumped glitter on Drew's back and in his hair..assholes...
They left around 12:45. Sadness...I didnt want Drew to leave...and Sica didnt want Scott to leave. But at least Sica got a goodnight kiss."

HOLY SHITE MUSLIM! I cannot believe it. That is the nicest thing that has ever come out of her mouth. I'll explain later.

My 4th started out kinda sucky...mommy dearest was making me clean up the house...(I'm lazy, what can I say?) But then Taylor calls and asks if she can bum (actually buy but she never pays me...dunno why I supply her...) a pack of cigarette. So I tell my mom she wants to get a cd that she can listen to on her way to her grandmother's. And she says ""why dont you just go with her?"" So I asked Tay if she wanted me to come and she said yeah. So off we went with two unopened packs of cigarettes to her grandmothers. Nothing much happened there. Least not anything of any importance or amusement.
After we got back we went to Johnathon's to see how many fireworks we had. We decided we need more Roman Candles and bottle rockets. Bombs, you know the drill. So Tay and I went and spent $20 on more fireworks. Then back to Johnathon's to pick up him and the rest of the explosives and we headed to Shannon's. We made a mini mushroom cloud on her porch and then a bigger one on the street. And of course they shot fireworks at me...cause I suck I guess...I dunno...Then Drew, Scott, Chip, and Katie showed up. Thats when the real fun began. So many pretty colors...
Well...Katie and Chip left...and then Tay had to go home to shoot fireworks with the kids so we changed locations. After shooting with the kids at Penguin's we went down the street to Tay's and started making our big bomb. I hit Drew in the side with a metal pole to avenge Scott for his wrist. Then I spared Drew and then Scott. Lot of little shit happened and something big that doesn't concern any of you...Then Myles showed up. We lit the big bomb, pissed off some neighbors...Fun fun man.
Then back to Shannon's. Johnathon, Taylor, and Penguin left at this point. We couldn't play with any more fireworks at Shannon's either because of people calling and complaining...so we went swimming instead. And some point during our excursion in the pool...Drew asked me out...w00t. It was great...and of course those other fools we all fighting...crazy mother fuckers...Anyway, they left around 4 am.
Once Shannon and I were in her room, She said she was proud of me and was glad that Drew and I were going out. That I did good for once. Cause Drew's a good guy...yeah. I am still shocked.

Don't concern yourself with my slow dying
Through the fence I hear you sigh
I dont get too high these days

Lights out you can't come in

If you don't ask I won't upset you</center>

I got a message from Jen today. It said, ""amanda if you like guys so much why do you call yourself bi or gay?"" It's like...honey, do you know why bi means? I LIKE BOTH!! Oi...why is she being so bitchy?

Cause they might be doing something with my beloved theatre people. Whos numbers....I have lost...I lose everything, seriously. Been looking for my wallet for months.

Well. Everyone will be GLAD to know, I have officially given up on Taylor. Its just not worth the trouble and fights. So...Im probably going to ask a certain guy out soon...if he doesnt do it first. Im giving him one more week. The only reason he hasnt done it yet is because hes uncertain if he should or not because of...Taylor. Of course. So few know who I am talking about. Yay.

"event","its 21 days until i get to see my man &hearts; im 1 day past the halfway mark! i havent talked to him in 9 days and its hard, but i know these last 3 weeks of basic are crucial because of all the academic and physical testing. We're booking our flight and im goin got be in Lackland Texas for 4 days<3. WE have to fly into san antonio, but its all good, being that i live in FL. its just a little bit west of us. The flight shouldnt be bad, its the time difference thats gonna get me. I think that their one houir ahead of us, or maybe its behind....whatever! the important thing is that i get to see my man and kiss him and hug him and hear his hearbeat. thats all ill ever need. 
 
<BR> i suppose that ill have to get used to this kind of life if he chooses a career in the USAF. But its worth it to me. Call me crazy but i will do anything to ensure that we work out. We;re going to be okay, and we're boith staying strong. I know that my support is crucial to his sucess but sometimes its hard not to cry. sometimes i break down, but then i just read the letters he has sent and look through pictures and its all worth it. 

<BR> its been 22 days, and im going to do this."

Eyes that set me free, 
All the places that I've been. 

Thank you for the letters that you thought you wrote in vain 
And times you chose to stand out in the rain and wait for me, 
For me.

Your words, 
Your words help me to see 
A little honesty 
In a world that doesn't share 
And those eyes 
Tell the story of your pain 
Severity of your disdain 
In a world that doesn't care.

So thank you for the letters that you thought you wrote in vain 
And times you chose to stand out in the rain and wait

We, we understand my pain. 
From this I gather strength, 
That we are the same.

So thank you for the letters that you thought you wrote in vain 
And times you chose to stand out in the rain and wait

it was amazing, i spent the night at his house on saturday and woke up with him looking at me <b>""you're so beautiful when you sleep.""</b> he told me. We made a homemade breakfast and layed in bed most of the day, talking about all the amazing things we've done and all the memories we have made, we talked breifly about him leaving.....ive decided not to be so selfish in wanting to keep him here. the only thing that i can do is wait for him and never stop loving him. 

we went on a dinner cruise from 6:30 - 10:00 pm. it was fantastic, we stood on the deck and watched the sunset <b>""we are more than most will ever have.""</b> he told me and kissed me hard right in front of all the poeple standing there. in that moment we were invincible.<BR> <b> ""your the love of my life </b> i told him <BR>""i know"" he replied"

i know that some of you are going to college and others are starting the l;ast year of their high school careers. i just wanted to wish you all the best. Nick leaves in 3 weeks. its almost like one of those things that you know is going to happen but it wont seem real. i dont think that it will seem real until i go to call him and realize he wontbe there to pick up. i wont realize until my heart starts aching. i just have to tak eit one day at a time. i iknow that the last thing that he would ever want was for me to be depressed and sad and i refuse to let myself turn into my own enemy. I dont want to be the reason fo rmy own sadness. yes, nick leaving is probaby going to be one of the worst feelings ill ever have, but hes the love of my life....further giving meaning to the ""if you love something let it go"" mantra. 

point is, im going to need alot of hugs, kisses and nights of chick flicks and ben and jerry. i know that he still loves me and i know that he is (more importantly) <b>in</b> love with me. these next couple of months, days, weeks, whatever are going to suck, but on a happier note, hes accomlishing his dream and i want nothing else but to support him <b>i am so selfish for wanting to keep him all to myself</b>

[02] Which is worse, a teenage actor trying to sing or a teen pop star trying to act?
[03] What is your tragic flaw and saving grace?
[04] Everyone has a strange talent (I can cross my toes!). What's yours?
[05] Some say laughter is the best medicine. What do you believe?

<1> I can't live without this one picture of me and my boyfriend kissing, and i know how cliche' this must sound but its not for the purpose of people looking at it and the satisfaction of getting an <s>""aw, you guys are like so like cute,"" </s> . It is just a constant reminder that i trusted someone with my heart. i gave someone else the power to become a part of me. I gave someone the power to break my heart along with the trust that he wouldn't. I fell in love and he is my soulmate. Its a constant reminder of how letting my guard down, gave me confidence and someone who will be by my side to listen to my thoughts rater then venting to a page of my diary <b>i did it</b> and iim somewhat proud of myself.

<2>A teenage actor trying to sing. no need for lengthy explanation here.

<3>My tragic flaw is not letting people see the angry and sad side of me. I find this constant need to be happy or at least <i>seem</i> happy. In my head, if im strong for people around me and i keep being an optomist, than they will be okay. For some reason i need to have the people around me happy. <BR> My saving grace is the simple fact that i can unwind when needed. If i know that im too stressed or i feel pressed to do something i can walk away for a little while to logically think of things. I dont really procrastinate it either. I just wait until im level headed and it allows me to make more fulfilling logical decisions.

<4> Uhm, my strange talent is that i can pop my shoulder blades. :)

<5> I believe that time is the best medicine. You can laigh whenever you want to inm order to mask something else. Time is the best healer."

In my day, I fail to see.
I fail to seek the one who gives life.
I've looked away from your grace.
You've been waiting at the gates.
I'm running, you're standing still.
It's been so long since I've been here.
It's time to come back again.
It's time to make correction.
Slain to the past.
Recovery (resurrect me) undeserving.
You love me still.
You're love, I love.
I've run away 1000 times
I've run away for the last time.
And I'm alone with bleeding and broken hands.
It's been so long since I've seen your love.



no, i didnt write this, still remains did. but i do have a reflection about it.
This song is all about how everyone looks away from God and how no matter what he is still there, no matter how far you run or stray. We are all undeserving of his love, simply because of the fact that we all sin and we all make decisions that do not reflect the better of us. <b>im not preaching here</b> believe me. i never go to church. i really never pay much attention in religion class and although i go to a catholic school, that doesnt make me any different or more worth or whatever. Im not saying that you should go to church every sunday. im not saying that i am the <i>super christian</i> or that i am any better than any one of you. because i definetly am not. But i am saying, that what you have, you did aquire by yourself. If you got somewhere because of your talent than you have to thank whomever you believe in for allowing you to discover your talent. <BR> you are never alone. you are never unloved. so cut this ""everyone hates me, noone loves me crap"" <----not that im speaking to anyone is particular.<BR> just take a moment to thank him for everything you have<BR> everyone has <b>something</b>"

Nick, you are the only reason that i am who i am now. You've loved me through the good days and the days when i needed someone to listen to me so that i can ge tmy thoughts out, and then divert my head somewhere else so my mind can come to terms with how what i was upset over, wasen't worth it. You've helped me to appreciate the ones around me and you've taught me what love is. You've shown me how lovely it is to be in love and its to the point where i cant live without knowing that your happy. Its just dependable love. You've loved me despite every bad habit (which youve helped me overcome), everyday when i was a little sad, and everytime i kept you on the phone for hours just to talk.

"event","i hate how innocent beautiful girls feel the need to form to some mold because that is what peeople tell them is beautiful. Over time i feel that girls loose their sense of individuality and self-respect because the standards of what society and the people around them set. For example, there is a girl sitting next to me, with so much mascara on that it looks like she drew long lines from her lower eye lid with eyeliner. Her mascara and eyeliner are so dark that it melts into her eye. She has so much blush on that you dont know what her natural skin color is. She has a fake tan which she probably got from countless hours of roasting herself in a tanning bed. yeah, this is what we call beautiful. I wonder what happens when she goes home and looks at herself. Does she wear all of that makeup because she has something to hide? If she walks out of the house without makeup, is she embarrased? What happens if she cries? I think that her whole face would turn black from mascara and eyeliner and she would go blind from the burning in her pupils. Maybe she puts all of that makeup on just to feel that pain. To take her mind off of the reason that she is crying in the first place.

its so weird.
im used to him picking me up from school on fridays
going home at 11:40 when my ""curfew"" is reallu 11:00(but my parents are cool and they don't really care)
waking up saturday and calling him at noon
seeing him on sunday
coming home late again
talking on sunday
seeing him once during the week
the cycle repeats.

and the fact that it is so hard for me to be away sucks, but i think the reason its so hard is because im the one who is away and i know that it would be better if i had just stayed home. but the again, he gets to see his friends who probably think im taking him away from them. so all is good.

                            you can never forget true love
                             please never forget, my love
              you can never forget the one who gives you butterflies
                            you still give me butterflies
                          you can never forget their taste
                             i still taste our last kiss
               there is one person that you are destined to be with
                                   i found you

<n3 always and forever"

"event","<b>I'm moving to Hawaii when I'm 24.</b>A year after college, i will find work in the city of Honolulu most likely in the field of computers/graphic design.I'm not sure whether i'll live on Oahu, (the island where Honolulu is located)but i'll probably end up living there at first instead of Molokai- where i really would like to live becuase it is the most undeveloped island of Hawaii and there is barely anyone there. There's rainforrests and desserted beaches there.and there isn't even one single traffic light there. the only problem is, it is about 50 miles east of Oahu. Which would be extremely expensive to fly back and fourth every day. I could live outside of Honolulu for my first few years, and then once the money starts rollin'in, i will save up for a speed boat to take me to and from work, so i can then live on Molokai Island. You're probably all laughing reading this now, and I don't blame you because i've had a lot of krazy/stupid ideas in the past, which you may be aware of, and i am only 16 and may not know so much. but i have seven years to figure this out, and it will be a dream come true. and tara hates me right now, but she'll be happy in 7 years when she visits me and takes her pick from all the hawaiian guys that i plan to hook her up with.<br>

I'm very excited about this.<br>

10. you're so cute. you're like the perfect boy. i wish i could tell you that, without it being incredibly awkward.

11. you're like my ro-model. i will never really admit to that. but some have noticed.but that's your job.its basically always been like that, but recently, its gotten worse.haha.i tend to talk like you, dress like you, and act like you now.i really miss you, even when i don't see you for just one week-end. we've been getting along a lot better lately.i guess b/c we're both getting older, although we still fight here and there, which is quite alright. you have always been there for me. and i mean, since day 1. meaning my d.o.b. it's good to know that you and i will be there for eachother always, even though we don't have a choice, since we're blood. anyway, i love you and thanks for...well thanks for everything.


12. i wish we talked more this year, b/c its weird not talking to you. its all interesting talking to you, whether its about whats currently going on in your life or we're just rambling about some past memories we've had together. i'm really scared that we'll lose touch when we get older and i hope that never happens. i know you're goin through some tough stuff right now, and i just want you to know,that i love you and that i will always be there for you. always. if you ever need to talk or just need some company,i'll be there. i miss you. my blood."

"event","""blindfolded"" - Saves the Day

So now I've made the decision 
to walk behind you in the dark for the rest of my life 
and I'll never show my face again 
because it's too scarred and bloody to be enough 
and I don't have the right stuff- 
all I have are the empty boxes to carry away your heart 
and I think that tonight I will sneak into your house 
and I'll sing songs and wake you up 
and I'll take you blindfolded dancing onto bridges 
and you'll say you don't to be with me 
caus' no one ever does and no one ever thinks of me that way 
but I will even drive you home if you never let me forget about you 
and if you promise me that I'm good enough for someone 
caus' I've got to be good enough for you 
and someday soon I'll get it right 
and then you'll see just how good I can be 
so don't ask me about forever because right now I'm feeling lost 
but there's got to be some place for me because
if there isn't where will I go? 
Will there be some place for me and will you be there waiting?
Will you be there waiting for me? 
If and when we get there please catch me before I crawl all the way home 
but I won't stop until you do."

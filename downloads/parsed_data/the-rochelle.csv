"event","My internship advisor was telling me how I should throw my UCLA degree around more, just like the USC kids do.  She said UCLA is an international brand, and I should exploit it to the fullest.  I think she's over paid and full of shit.  I was stuck in traffic earlier today (surprise, surprise), and I must've seen at least 5 cars with a UCLA or UCLA Alumni license plate holder. A UCLA degree does not make you special.  You have to sit in traffic just like every other neurotic asshole living in LA.  The one great thing about a UCLA brand plastered next to your name on your resume is that you are bound to be interviewed by a UCLA alum at least once in your tedious search for a career worthy of your high tuition.  I mean, there are like 40,000 undergraduates, the chances of you running into one of them in LA is pretty damn high, or so I hope...because that's what I'm counting on to get me in the door."

"event","The sun is setting at 6 now.  My room doesn't get filled with sunshine and morning heat now.  I finally washed my swim suit and placed it in the drawers.  The greasy guys who don't even come to this school, but still rented out the apartment across from me for the summer (for the sole purpose of partying and getting laid by ucla girls) have moved out.  My friends and I had a huge dinner last week to celebrate everyone's return to this grand ole city.  we're beginning to make plans: when shall we run around the city dressed as slutty princesses and witches and warlocks and bunnies and other characters which will allow us to show the maximum amount of skin as possible.  who's throwing what party on this night and who's playing beer pong on that night? Summer is over.  Let the fun and stress of Fall quarter begin.

It's 1:30pm and my roommate is cooking herself some bacon, while I'm sitting at the kitchen table checking my facebook, myspace, and email.  We haven't gotten our own internet yet, so we're borrowing it from our neighbors.  The kitchen is the only spot where I get any connection. I think i'm going to spend the rest of the day studying and preparing for my classes.  I'm taking Comm 101, Freedom of Communication, and I am scared shitless for this class. It's not even my first upper div class that I've taken for Comm, but i'm soo ridiculously intimidated by both the course load and the professor.  More so the professor than anything, I htink.  The other two classes I'm taking are all lower divs so I'm not too worried about those.  I'm still working two jobs, 26 hours a week in total.  And I'm hoping to do some research with one of my favorite faculty.  She's this intense and passionate Communications and Women's Studies professor who runs around the room getting angry at media and then falling head over heels over the warriors fighting the good cause (ie communism, feminism, and all those over isms).  She's awesome. As i'm writing this I realize how little time I actually have.  I still need to talk to my counselor about studying abroad, figure out if i'll graduate on time, start looking for an internship in hong kong, schedule and organize research opportunities, find an internship for next year, track my finances and prepare and plan for next summer, which by the wya, is going to be amazing.  I'm planning on going to study abroad for next Fall semester at Hong Kong University, but before that I'm planning on traveling around Europe with my friends for a few weeks. I'm so excited. I'm pretty stoked for life, man. ok, i should go and study now so that I can go running with Kulsum so that I won't be a fat ass blah blah blah"

I work about 36-40 hours a week, and am usually too tired to go out at night.  All I want to do is lay around, in a gorgeous dress, and smoke all the pot that i've bought.  

This is the first summer where I haven't had the chance to drive around Los Angeles at night for the pure sake of driving around Los Angeles at night.  This is also the first summer where I haven't wandered aimlessly around this city with Jennifer.  There are always plans.  This weekend i'm staying at ucla so that i can blah blah blah.  Next weekend I'm going home because I have to do this and do that.  I suspect that this is the beginning of a adult summers.  

I'm working a whole lot of hours this summer for two reasons: 1) I've been paying for rent and all other living expenses on my own, and it feels really good to not have to go to my mom for money.  I want to keep this up. and  2) I want to study abroad in Hong Kong for part of my senior year, and I'm also planning on going to Europe with Jennifer this winter break.  Both of these require lots of money.  And so i'm working hours that I hate, so that I can go to places that I want.  When i put it that way, it doesn't sound as bad as me actually spending all my money on drugs and dresses.  There's this quote from Fight Club that I really like ""We work jobs that we hate so that we can buy stuff we don't need""."

Last year, I lived on an all-girls floor, and although it was not my choice to live on that floor, I actually, by the end of the year, really appreciated it.  First, there wasn't as much drama as people would expect.  I mean, sure there were moments, but what do you expect when you put a bunch of vaginas on one floor? And second, the girls i made friends with are fucking awesome.  But this year, I live on a co-ed floor, which in itself is really fun, but my god, the drama that occurs between girls when boys are involved.  there's shit talking...who's fucking who and who...who got sexiled...who's a slut...and blah blah blah. like, chill, man. i suggest we smoke a/some bowl/s and watch the goonies. 

I want to go home, but my schedule won't allow it. i'm interning for democracy for change and i think i'm going to quit because i'm a selfish bitch and when it comes down to it, i'm not a philanthropist, maybe more of a misanthropist.  Another reason is that i got a job that pays with cash money instead of weed.

Oh, today is halloween, too bad i'm writing a paper instead of trick or treating. man, i thnk i got tricked. how lame. ok. i was a crack whore for this halloween party and no one got it until i put baby powder on my nose.  ohh, that reminds me, i couldn't find a fucknig person on my floor with baby powder, but i did find two people with crack, like wtf??? ughhhh, i hate mondays.

Ok, that's enough time dedicated to her. Now, I will rant, but don't expect anything wity or anything of that sort--i am too sleepy for that, bitch. 

I woke up at freaken 6am, showered, and somehow convinced myself that there was a ghost named Jorge on my floor.  I then walked down to westwood, found Kinko's,  and made my momma a calendar for her birthday.  Afterwards, I walked back to campus, waited for my Communication Studies discussion to begin, only to discover that the TA had cancelled the class and I, apparently, was the only one who doesn't check their email in the freaken morning.  I then laughed at how freaken lame my situation was and walked back to my room and took a half hour nap. I then went to mi clase de espanol, which I guess is going p retty well, especially since mi profesora dice ""Rochelle! Rochelle!""...ella conocer mi nombre.  Right afterwards I went to North Campus to buy a burrito, a steak burrito nonetheless.  It was about 1:20pm when I finally got my food and I was supposed to be at my internship at 1:30, so obviously I just had to go back to my room and change into tennis shoes and drop off my books and whatnot.  I literally then ran back into westwood, past freaken wilshire, past the crazy drug dealers and the high school kids in uniforms.  I was late.  Today was my first day and it was amazing-- tiring, but still amazing.  I was done with work around 9:30pm, and although it was probably somewhat dangerous for me to walk back to campus at night, i took a pit stop at a store and bought myself a cheap and beautiful dress, which I will most likely wear to my mom's birthday dinner this Thursday.  Anyway, when I got back I basically just stared at my books for 2 hours and socialized for another two.  I have so much shit to do and yet i'm here updating.  livejournal and the internet are cool.  i'm cool. i have to write a fucking article, 1000 freaken words, and not the easy bullshit articles that I'm used to writing, but an actual serious one, with vocabulary beyond awesome and d0pe and lame. That's due Thursday and I have yet to do interviews or research. fuck, man.  also, i have to read a shitload of stuff for my film class and for my comm class. ohh, which reminds me, i need to convince my teacher to get on in this whole campaign against homelessness. ok ok ok ok , time to sleeep. i'm tired. blah.  

p.s. i feel like i'm in highschool again...the whole stress factor, i mean.  i kind of like it though.  i think i need that constant packed agenda in order to get the wheels going again, ya huurd?? otherwise, i'd just be online and sleeping and drinking and talking and smoking and downloading movies and music."

so i decided to spend this weekend catching up and all that great stuff, but then all these plans started popping up. i've lost all my time management skills, i suck at this whole ""balancing"" thing.
but but but, i try not to let it get to me. tomorrow is pay day, woo hoo! i'm going to go take a 45 minute bus ride to buffalo exchange tomorrow with my friend, connie, and then afterwards we're going to some dumb frat party.  I'll spend saturday in the dorms, studying and writing this stupid paper, or at least pretending to. And on sunday I really want to go to pennylane to buy the Gang Starr cd, they're way d0pe.  Then on Monday i'm going to try real hard to take the bus to see chris's band play.  and then on friday is my midterm for my Molecular and Cellular Biology in Cancer course. 

Oh, and I found the girl who stole my facewash. That biotch. i'm going to stick those ""be cool. don't steal facewash"" flyers all over her door. yeahhh, that's what i'll do. 

I feel so unproductive. I procrastinate way too much; it's just like high school, except this time, it's harder.  I have two essays to write every week and I always write them 2 hours before they're due. And then I end up having to run to class, which isn't very fun.  

ok, i think that's all i have to update.

My first class, US History in the 1960s, seems very interesting and intense. We analyzed Jimmy Hendrix's affect on US culture as a median for the angst, chaos, shame, and intensity of our government, generation and emotion in the 1960s. One of the four teachers teaching this class seems very fun and posesses this Beaty-like enthusiasm, which I really like.  I'm excited about this class, but at the same time extremely terrified. There is a shitload of things to read and write.  I feel so unorganized right now.  

My second class, English Composition, was only one hour.  It was alot smaller and more intimate than my 200+ US History class. We had an in-class essay on some stupid thing. It was similar to the Subject A exam, but more lame because it just was. Yeah. ok.

I got a job at this Northern Cafe/Lights thing. I'm not sure what I'm doing, but I'm working 5 hours a week, and that should help out a little. Hell, anything will be good. I'm low on money.

My roommate, Linda, is cool.

I have no internet because I have no ethernet. damn ethernet.

I live on an all girls floor =(

Everyone is so tall and thin and beautiful. And it makes me feel...not tall and not thin and not beautiful.

All summer I've only been using two adjectives, cool and lame.  And now, I feel very lame because everyone here uses adjectives like superb and whatnot. It's all very lame. 

I live in Hedrick, room 509. Come and visit! 

Ok, I have more stories to tell but I'm using my roommate's computer so until I get my ethernet cord, I shall update later.

Now, it wasn't so much that the highlight of these gorgeous girls was trying out for Playboy, but it was the fact that they didn't even get in. I mean, I could see how you'd be proud of donating your body for the goodness of man's sexual existance, but pOlEeZzee sLut, you didn't even get in! 
 
hahha, but with all jokes aside, I was actually more bothered by the question than with the response.  Highlight of your life, of your existence, as if life itself is a storyline.  With the whole literature rollercoster; with a beginning, a climax, and a resolution.  Rather, I think it's just a bunch of random, insignifiant moments, miraculously falling together to create a vague definition of life.  It's moments like reading college prep books at Borders and drinking over priced coffee with Jan, Mary, and Twinkies.  Moments like watching Donnie Darko at 3am with Tiffany, drinking mixes of hard liquor, and eating grapes.  Moments like talking to Matt till 4am about psychic abilities.  Moments like gossiping with Mickey and Vera about YMCA drama.  Moments like going to the Journalism bathroom with The Stupids. Moments like going to Taco Bell to order a Fiesta Burrito with Claudiu.  Moments like eatting sand covered churros at the dirty beach.  Moments like sneaking into Costco to eat lunch with Amy.  Moments like going body boarding at the beach with Canadians and Jennifer.  Moments like my family's Joy Luck Clubs.  Moments like watching free concerts at the park.  Moments like sitting, and staring, and pondering about nothing. Moments like after a nice swim, reading a great book, taking a warm bath, and coming out of the shower without hard nipples and goosebumps gracing your body.  Moments like driving to Westwood, running over Mexican Orange Sellers.  Moments like exchanging Jack Daniel and Capt. Morgan bottles for money.  Moments like these are the good life.  
 
Thanks to all my beautiful, wonderful, lovely buddies for making the past 17 years awesome.

On a side note, Spiderman 2 was the worst movie I've seen.  90% of the movie was just Peter Parker being emo and the other 10% was the dumb little kids in the movie theatre screaming, kicking my chair, and spilling soda on the floor.  But my conversation with Jaison last night was by far the best conversation I've had this week. 

Both Jaison and I agreed that the whole love thing between Peter Parker and MJ should be cut out of the movie; the entire movie should just be Spiderman swinging around buildings, it would have been much better.

Take away my phone? I hate paying for the cell phone bill anyways."" There wasn't anything important enough to me that she could take away and truly hurt me.  So ultimately, I figured I had nothing to lose.  So I drove off.

I didn't have any particular destination.  I just drove for the sake of driving, but I knew I had to go somewhere because the tears were blurring my vision.  So I went to the Eagle Rock Library.  Lame, I know, but it was the only place that I could think of.  So there I was just sitting in the parking lot staring at the magnificent design of bird poop on the library's brick wall.  After a good cryfest, I realized that there were kids hanging around the parking lot and that I had become one of those crazy people who sit in their cars in parking lots, not waiting for someone or anything but just sitting there for the sake of being somewhere and doing something.

So I went to Jan's house. And stayed there until now.  

I just had to get away...away from everything, away from them all.  I just can't stand to see their faces.

I can't wait till high school is over.  I don't think I'm going to miss home or Eagle Rock very much.  I don't think I'll get homesick. And I don't think that I'm going to visit home very often either.  Most likely, I won't see or talk to my family for the next four years, which isn't a terrible or sad thing for me; rather, more relieving."

"event","Highschool is such a redundent routine, with your occasional love and hurt that will stay with you for the rest of your life. That's what Ebert & Roeber said about the movie Elephant. I think it's really true, but that theory goes beyond high school, it's life. And every now and then we find cheap thrills in a vain attempt to break this cycle, only to end up where we began--bored, robotic, and detached. I finally saw Better Luck Tomorrow and I think everyone NEEDS to watch that awesome movie. It's about finding and giving the wake up call everyone needs. It's about love and lost. It's about perfection. It's about luck. It's about getting what you want. It's about choosing your own future. It's about walking off the straight and narrow. it's about living on your own terms.

So I realized why I don't deal with change very well. It's because I'm afraid that once something changes, it'll be forever. I hate that word--forever. It's so unchangeable. I know I'm contradicting myself, but in some warped George Orwell 1984 world, it makes sense. 

When I was younger I never pinned my posters to the wall because it seemed too permanent--those holes you leave in the wall will be there forever. So now I have pieces of duck tape peeling off the paint on the wall...which is better than holes, right?"

I'll still be getting it when I'm in college!) Anyways, like always, the results from the 10 question quiz said that I'm moderate--I handle change well while remembering and staying true to my roots. Oh the wisdom that CosmoGirl holds! 

There's so much movement, so much change, so much action, so much laughter, so much talk, so much tears, so much confusion. Everything around me is spinning and I'm trying desperately to grasp onto a stronghold, something to keep me ""true to my roots"". So far I've had no luck. I'm leaving home in 2 months. I'm going to New York for the summer with The Stupids (The first time I leave home on my own). Feelings are shifting. Emotions are flowing. Friendships are ending, Friendships are forming. I know life is a cycle, AP english poetry taught me that. Life consists of death, cycle/time, and love. That's it. Well, and allusions, metaphors, and similies. Ok, getting out of nerd mode and back to the subject. Even though I'm bonding with new people, I'm still sad that I'm losing another. Maybe time is what we need to strengthen our friendship. Lately her and I haven't been talking and hanging out. I've been hanging out with other girls and she's been chilling with Key Club people. :/

Since our breakup, he's hooked up with a handful of dumb bitches, and not pretty ones either, but just dumb sluty bitches. That makes me feel even worse.  I don't want to be just another name on his list.  But in teh four months that we were dating, I had the most fun I've ever had with anyone.

"event","This weekend was awesome. I kareoked till 1 in the morning. But today wasn't so wonderful.  There wasn't anything in particular that made me angry or stressed or frustrated--it was just the day in general.  It probably began when I looked at the page we bought in the yearbook and how much better looking it could have been.  I'm a perfectionist and everything and anything that's not as perfect as it can be I stress about.  I stress about the littlest and dumbest things too.  It's taking it's toll on my body though.  Last year my hair started falling out in certain spots and my scalp was bleeding.  The doctor said it was because of stress.  But they gave me medicine and now I'm better.  But now I'm getting anxiety spots on my stomach.  I know you're probably thinking, ""well, then STOP stressing! Just relax.""  But the thing with me is that I CAN'T just stop stressing, it's apart of who I am--I overexagerate things and make them into monumental events, like brushing and flossing my teeth. 

I came home and wanted to vent to someone about nothing in particular, so I called my best friend, but she was sleeping and told me to call back later.  And I had no one else to call, so I just went to sleep listening to Pat Benatar.  Good ole' Pat always makes me feel better.  The energy and intensity transfuses into me, making me just want to get up and dance.  I love her music.  

Key Club is coming to an end, April 2 to be exact.  As much as I stress and bitch about Key Club, I will miss it.  The larger part of my (and the rest of the board) senior year has been dedicated to this club and as a result our club is better than it has ever been, with over 100 active members (seniors alone make up about 70)!  I'm worried about the future of Key Club though.  I mean, we've basically handed over our hard work, sweat, and tears to a group of potential failures who will most definitely screw up this club.  I'm afraid that this year, Eagle Rock Key Club is at its peak.  It's going downhill from here. Stephen said he'll stay in ER all for the sake of Key Club; he will run his dominian through the new board.  

""We're running with the shadows of the Night
so baby take my hand it'll be alright
surrender all your dreams to me tonight
it'll all be true in the end"" 

I'm so nervous and excited at the same time about college.  On one hand I'm so afraid of leaving my comfort zone; I have finally become used to high school and now I have to leave.  I have a few regrets, but for the most part, I'm quite content with the past four years.  I'm afraid that I'm not going to make it on the college level.  I'm afraid that I won't know how to take care of myself.  I'm afraid of getting sick and not having my mommy there to take care of me and thus, die of a cold.  I've been babied for so long that I might die of a lack of day-to-day skills that ""normal"" teens learn, like cooking eggs or washing the toilet.  But then there's also that anxious and excitement that comes with leaving college.  I'll finally be able to be on my own and be in control my own life.  I'll be defining my limits, my terms, my reach, my life.  exciting times.  good times. good times."

Call it senioritus, call it whatever the hell you want, I don't care.  I find myself doing a whole lot of nothing, and I mean literally nothing.  It's not like I'm wasting time in a good productive way, like watching t.v. or listening to music, but instead, I'm just sitting on my bed staring at the wall.  And I'm not even sitting and thinking some deep philosophical or teen-angst thoughts.  I'm just sitting and not caring.  

I've completely become apathetic about schoolwork, Key Club, and, well basically everything else.  I just did a few sit-ups right now, like 20 or so, and I had to stop because I started getting dizzy.  I used to be able to do 100 easily, and now I faint when I do 20.  Usually, I'd be bothered by the immense weight I've gained.  But right now, I don't care if I become massive; I figured that I'd just buy a bigger dress size. I used to be addicted to diets, like, I literally loved to go on diets.  I figure it's because I'm a control freak and diets gave me a control over myself (if that makes any sense).  I used to be pretty damn good at diets too.  I didn't go on any Atkins or things like that.  I had this way of truly convincing myself that I was huge and ugly and gross, yet at the same time have control of that thought and be able to really know that I was normal and okay.  I think the best way to describe it is to use ""doublethink"", a term George Orwell created in his novel, ""1984"".  Doublethink means that you are able to convince yourself of one thing yet still KNOW and have complete faith in the opposite thing...sorta like a paradox I guess you can say.  Anyways, that diet strategy had always worked for me.  I tried it again a few weeks ago, but this time, it failed completely.  I just don't care anymore.  I don't care if I get all massive and nasty, I don't care.  And without a will, there is never a way.  So I guess I'll just get a bigger dress size.  Whatever."

"event","I saw Passion of the Christ last week and I loved it.  It was wonderful.  It was honest.  It was brutal. It was ugly. It was beautiful.  It was brutal.  It was sad.  It was sweet.  Before watching it I was for some strange reason nervous.  I think it was because I had to prepare myself for what the critics say ""a movie that will stir your emotions"".  It depicted the last 12 hours of Jesus's life.  Some people said it was too violent, but I think the violence and the realism was a necessity to really understand the pain that He went through.  Every other version I have ever seen of Jesus's cruxifiction has always been a sugar-coated beating that Jesus endured so gracefully and divinely; I didn't see him as a human, instead, he seemed more like a divine demi-god that had a magical bubble around him protecting him from physical and emotional pain.  But in Passion, I saw and grasped the idea that He was like you and me; He shivered when he was cold, He mourned when He was sad, and He danced when he was happy.  I can go on and on about this movie but my neck is suffering from extreme pain right now so I think I will go home and put on some more Bengay Stickers."

"event","I remember when I forgot my knee-high Brownie uniform socks, and she drove back to the store to get me one.  I remember when I didn't get any string cheese and she gave me half of hers.  I remember when we were in the televised Girl Scout Parade and I was too short to hold the banner and she lowered it for me.  I remember when we started that business selling friendship bracelets at school, and we got in trouble and had to stand on the Yellow Line.  I remember when we played Barbies and had only one Ken with no leg; so all our Barbies became lesbiens.  I remember when we played house: we were two sisters living in a tractor with parents who were strippers. I remember when we built that fort in my dad's construction site everyday after school.  I remember how we almost poked our eyes out when we were playing in that fort; I see now that using those rusty, bent nails weren't such a good idea.  I remember when we went digging for dinosaur bones in your backyard.  I remember when we were throwing sticks into that boiling pot of tar and having it almost splash all over us.  I remember when we were playing at my dad's construction site and fell asleep on the things used to insolate the walls.  Little did we know that we were both allergic to it.  I remember when we got in trouble with the Balloon Lady for farting and making pooping noises in her shop.  I remember when all our friends got mad at us cause we wouldn't stop playing belly busters at Amy's sleepover.  I remember when we were obsessed with JTT and buried a shrine for him in the swingset sandbox.  I remember when you came up with a plan rescue me from teh Yellow Line because I was telling those dirty jokes.  I remember when you flooded the toilet at Chuck E' Cheeses.  I remember when we were partners in crime.  I remember the innocence.  

But now you're going on it alone.  I want to save you.  Be a trooper and cooperate, please."

And the ending was another reinforcement of my frustration.

After buying the spirit supplies (oh, the irony) I turn left into Arco, because UNICO sucks.  So I pay for the gas and because the Universe hates me today, the gas hose decides to squirt gas out EVERYWHERE! And I mean everywhere.  So there I am, standing in the middle of a puddle of gas, halfway in tears, and holding the mean, stupid gas hose.  I didn't have the heart or the strength to bitch or to ask for help. So I just stand there like a stupid girl. Then a nice man comes and helps me.  Where would the world be without nice samaritans? Ohh, I don't know.

Anyways, I thank him dearly and stick my hand through the open window to unlock the door.  My super, high tech alarm goes off.  And I forgot how to turn it off.  So there I am again, standing in front of my car, alarm screeching, and everyone just staring and telling me to turn it off. But I don't know how."

"event","GRRRR!!!!! I was finally almost finished with the next round of stuff for the Opera.  All I had to do was scan in the paintings, patch it together, and add the text.  We're talking an hour of work max.  I go to use the scanner and it won't fucking work.  It's not set up with our new version of Photoshop.  Then I go to use the internet and I can't figure out how to switch the connection from the MAC to the PC.  DAMN IT DAMN IT DAMN IT DAMN IT.  Now I have to go to work early and finish this up.  That means I will be working, at work, for an hour, and I won't get paid for it because I won't be working on stuff for them.  I AM SO PISSED!!!!!!!!  I can't just be left hanging with all the equipment I need to do my job not working.  I know this is edit is way more important than anything I'm doing but I would like to at least delude myself for a little while that what I do makes a difference.  I just don't like how this whole thing is going.  I have missed every single deadline.  Not all of the problems were my fault.  I had the first illustration approved months ago and they decided when I went to get the layout approved a week before the deadline that the illustration was too abstract.  So I had to go back to square one.  Everyone says they're being too demanding but I don't think so.  They are a client.  Whether or not they're paying.  They are at least giving us ad space which, at this time, is invaluable to us just starting our business. I need to be taking this seriously and not pissing them off.  I would like to be able to use them as a reference for future freelance work.  At this rate, I would be embarrassed to have anyone ask them how the process has been.  I am thrilled with the work I've done.  I really think everything is turning out beautifully.  But the deadline thing drives me nuts.  I HATE missing deadlines.  It makes me want to throw up.  GRRRRR.  I guess since I can't get any work done I'll use some of this frustrated energy to get in a kick ass work out, then I'll probably go pass out since I'll have to get up at the buttcrack of dawn.  SHIT SHIT SHIT!!!!!!"

"event","I am so fricking tired and I have to go into work tonight.  Waitressing is so draining, not just physically but emotionally as well.  It's so damn demoralizing.  I was up last night working on the Annapolis Opera stuff.  It's really going to be amazing and it will be really great for my portfolio to show some more graphic based work.  I'm very pumped about it.

I have two interviews/meetings next week.  One is more of a meeting, on Monday, with the company doing all the printing for the opera stuff.  They want to talk to me about where I see myself going.  I'm hoping I can kind of turn it into a job interview.  I would love to find something in the area.  Tuesday I have the interview with Northrup Grumman for the graphic artist/ receptionist job.  I would do the receptionist thing until I get security clearance, which takes a while these days.  I am really excited/ nervous.  We really need to move out on our own.  Everyone involved is getting frustrated.  Jeff's parents are so amazing.  It's gotta be so hard for them to have us living here this long.  They definitely need their space back and it's time for Jeff, Becca, and I to be out on our own.  Wish me luck!

I feel incredible potential for next week.  Like nothing can stop us now.  We'll hope my instincts are right!

"event","My dearest Becca Boo-

Exactly one year ago you were born.  One year ago I was lying in a bed, scared and shaking, so very sick.  Your grammy had such a worried look on her face but no one would tell us what was going on.  We just knew that I had gotten very sick, very fast and that you were in danger.  Your Daddy was rolling a cold bottle of water across my forehead, trying to cool me down from the fever.  Then they wheeled me into the operating room, gave me the medicine, and put me on the table.  We knew your body wasn't ready to be born yet.  We should have known and trusted that your spirit was.

Daddy got to hold you first.  I was lying on the table with a sheet draped up so I couldn't see them take you out of my belly.  I didn't hear you crying and I was so scared.  Then, suddenly, Daddy brought you over to me.  It was....there are no words.  The words do not exist in our frail language to describe what a mother feels the first time she sees her baby girl.  Such immense joy and wonder.  How could someone as insignificant as me create something so utterly amazing?  How could two people come together in love and produce this perfect little person?  What could I ever have done to deserve such a precious gift?  I don't know to this day, but there is one thing I do know.  I am eternally grateful.

I am grateful to God for bringing such an amazing spirit into my life.  Someone who, in her very first year of life, has taught me more about love, trust, faith, hope, wonder, joy, sorrow, worry, sacrifice, and strength than my twenty five years of life have taught me.   But most of all, you have taught me patience.  Patience in you, in Daddy, in myself, but most importantly, in God.  You are the embodiment of the truth that God has a plan for all of us and though what happens may not make sense to our earthly realm of understanding, there is a greater power and a greater plan.

I am so proud of you, my darling princess.  You have shown so much strength of body and spirit in your short time on this earth.  You fought so hard in the NICU.  We were told you would be there until your due date.  You surprised us all by being there for only one week.  It was the longest week of my life.  It was torture for us to see you hooked up to all those machines and IV's.  We wanted to take you home so badly but knew that you were where you needed to be.  Your nurses took such good care of you.  We would come in and see you as much as they would let us.  The day we brought you home was like heaven on earth.  I will never forget that first night.  The first thing Stanley did when we brought you in the house was steal your binky.  He loved walking around with it in his mouth.  You were so scared that first night.  You had been sleeping in a room full of beeping monitors and with the lights on all the time.  Suddenly you were in a quiet apartment in the dark.  So I picked you up and held you on my lap.  We both fell asleep.  It was the most amazing feeling to wake up holding you.  I would come home from class to find Daddy napping and you lying next to him on the bed.  I fell in love with both of you all over again every time I saw that.  

I have so many prayers for you my love.  I pray that you will grow to be a kind and loving person.  I pray that you will fulfill the amazing amount of potential we already know you have.  I pray that you will learn from all this world has to offer, taking nothing for granted.  I pray that you will love the the world you live in, for though it can be harsh and painful, it can also be so amazing, brilliant, and beautiful.  I pray that you will always see your glass as being half full.  I pray that you will always know that no matter what happens, you have an amazing family in your Mom-mom, Pop-pop, Grammy, Grandpa, Nana Kate, and all of your Uncles and Aunts- they will be there for you no matter what!  I pray most of all that you will always know how much your Daddy and I love you, and that you will learn to share that love with your world.  You are our legacy, our immortality.  You are our circle of life playing itself out.  In your eyes, I see hope for the future and validation for the troubles of the past.  I see every tiny thing about your Daddy I fell in love with.  I see my life and purpose.  It's an amazing thing...I was put here to be your mother.  I treasure my role and I promise to you that I will fulfill it in every way I know how.  We will all grow and learn together.  Every day will be a new discovery for us.  We will do it together.

Welcome to the world my precious girl.  It is waiting for you with open arms.  Embrace it!

Love,
Mommy"

"event","So things are kind of crazy.  Teaching job is up in the air until the end of the summer.  They were very impressed by me but, because of state law, can't hire me until they at least interview certified teachers.  Seems very stupid to me.  On a high school level, wouldn't it be better to have someone with an art degree teaching art than someone with a teaching degree?  Oh well.  Jeff's aunt is working on getting one or both of us jobs with her company.  The pay would be really great.  They have both a receptionist job and a graphics job open.  If I get the receptionist job they'd have me doing some graphic stuff too, just to see what I can do.  Then I'd be up for that position possibly.  That would be so great.  I'm not sure which job I'd rather have, the teaching or the stuff at this company.  Having summers off would be nice with Becca but I think I'd feel much more secure with a job at this company, plus the pay would be a lot better and there's a lot more room for growth.  

Becca and I took a nice, hour-long brisk walk this afternoon.  My dad is getting me a jogging stroller for my birthday.  I can't wait.  It will be so nice to be able to run again.  Plus I could also rollerblade, which would be a lot of fun.  It's really important to me that she gets to spend a lot of time outside and they she grows to love nature.  She already does.  It's amazing to watch her watching everything.  Every little thing is a learning experience for her.  It really does blow my mind.  Her birthday is on Sunday.  I can't even believe it.  A year old already.  Where did the time go?  This year has gone by so fast and so incredibly slow all at the same time.  A good friend of ours sent her a birthday card and wrote something truly touching in it.  I don't want to write the person's name, privacy and all, but here's what was written:  ""Happy 1st Birthday to the little one!  Your family gives me hope and strength that love makes it all better and life is precious...""  To this person I say ""Thank you.""  You will never know what your kind words mean.  

And so we prepare to open another year for our little girl.  Who knows what it may hold.  The possiblities are endless.  May it be everything we've dreamed for her and more!

Peace and love,
Jennifer"

It's not so much that I don't think I'm going to get the job, in fact I'm feeling pretty good about my chances.  It's just that I want the job so bad that if I don't get it I'm going to be really bummed.  

I had my first two nights on my own at work last night and tonight.  I did awesome last night.  Two different managers took the time during our shift meeting to tell me how great I did.  The one wasn't even there last night!  Tonight I did fine but we were really slow so I didn't make as much money.  Kind of a bummer.  Oh well, hopefully I won't have to deal with it much longer!  I don't work again until Friday night so I'm taking that as a good cosmic sign!  

Gonna take Becca into DC either tomorrow or Tuesday to take her picture with all the cherry blossoms out.  Should be adorable.  I was putting away some of the clothes that she's grown out of and came across the outfit she wore home from the hospital.  She was so tiny!  It was actually too big for her at the time!  Damn, time goes fast.  I can't stand it.  She's going to be one!  It blows my mind."

This is for the high school art teacher position.  I am so pumped!  I don't usually ask for this but please, send prayers my way.  My family really needs this step.  I really need this step.

"event","So I had my second night of training at Applebee's.  I can't believe I have to go through another 3 nights of this bullshit!  I know how to wait tables, I've done it before.  I just have to learn the menu and following some other server around isn't really helping me with that.  So I'm gonna try to learn it this weekend and maybe see if they'll give me a break and let me not do my last night at least.  Who knows.  Of course hopefully this time next week I'll have a teaching job and I won't have to worry about it anyways!  Wouldn't that be the best!  I e-mailed the dude about the high school art teacher position but he's out of the office until next week so I must wait.  And wait I shall.     

I'm sitting here listening to Jeff breathing so peacefully as he sleeps.  It's just such a comforting thing to hear from him.  Even more so because it's rare.  Number one, he works nights so I hardly ever get to sleep in the same bed with him and, number 2, whatever his sleep disorder is he hardly ever sleeps peacefully.  The other night he was dreaming and kind of tossing and turning a bit.  Some instinct woke me up from my partial sleep and told me to move.  So I sat up as quick as I could.  Low and behold, as soon as I sat up he punched the mattress right where my head had been as hard as he could.  Turns out he was dreaming that he had to hit someone through a helmet and so he was punching as hard as he could.  That would have hurt like a bitch man!  I'm so glad I moved.  I really hope the sleep specialist has some answers for him, that's all I can say!

So Becca is starting to feel better after her third round of illness.  The doctor finally decided that she has asthma and so she's on breathing treatments anywhere from 2 to 4 times a day depending on how she's doing.  The poor little girl!  It sucks because we can't explain to her why she has to wear this uncomfortable mask that smokes.  Shit man, how scary must that be for an 11 month old little girl.  I'm so excited though.  Her birthday is one month away!  We're having a party for her and I designed her invitations.  I love them so far.  I'm hoping I'll have time tomorrow to paint them and print so that I can get them sent out early next week or maybe even this Saturday.  

I've been thinking a lot about Savannah lately.  I'm not really sure why.  It's an uncomfortable feeling for me.  I really loved it there, especially my job.  I mean as far as jobs that you don't need a college diploma for, it was the best.  I loved the animals and, for the most part, the people I took on tour were eager to hear what we had to say.  The bad part of Savannah is that whenever I start to think about it, I inevitable think about all the mistakes I made, particularly in my first year and a half there.  I made a bunch of them.  I think I most regret friendships that, though they're not necessarily lost, will never be as amazing as they could have been.  Mostly this is because of stupid, adolescent behavior on my part.  There are the friends that moved away and I lost touch with.  There are the friends who are still there who I have lost touch with.  Mostly when I think about Savannah, I just feel very very lonely.  I don't have any friends here at all.  That's such a difficult thing for me.  No matter what, wherever I've gone, I've always been able to make friends.  Maybe this is a sign that I've finally grown up.  I'm not so willing to conform, to compromise what I believe in just to fit in.  I feel proud about that but it is just so damn lonely.  I long for someone to talk to online for hours.  Someone to call and just say, ""hey what's up, how's it going.""  Someone to meet up with at a bar to talk about nothing in particular.  Please don't get me wrong, I love my husband more than I can ever possibly express with the limited and primitive communication of words.  But I've always been someone who just needed a friend from time to time.  This is just a very lonely existence for me right now.  There's no other way to explain it.

The more I go in there at night to check on her, the more used to not sleeping through the night she's getting.  But otherwise I have to listen to her screaming and feel like the most heartless mother on the planet.  

I wish there was an easy answer.  It's been 2 weeks now since I've gotten to sleep through the night.  I'm at my wits end.  I officially started my waitressing job today so now I have that to deal with on top of everything else.  Will this shit ever end?  

I love Jeff and Becca so much.  Right now that's what I'm hanging onto.  I know that this shitty time with her not sleeping will pass, but it's really hard for that to be enough to get me through when I'm not getting any sleep.  What to do?  

I don't think there is an answer.  Just have to wait this one out.  Hope to hear the peace of her quiet breaths on the other end of the monitor as she drifts back to sleep.  Poor little thing.  She needs her rest too."

Hey Hermie-

I wanted to talk to you on AIM real quick just to tell you I hope you're having a good night, but it's not on your computer yet and your mom's on the computer downstairs.  Becca's having another restless night.  Not crying to the point I have to get her, just to the point that I'm not gonna sleep, lol.  Did you notice that I found your checks today?  They were in the basket.  I put them on your desk chair for you.  YAY!  I do hope that your night is going ok.  I'm thinking about you.  I thought maybe the lyrics to one of my favorite songs would pick you up a bit.  It's how I feel about you. 

When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I would offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one to dry your tears
I would hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
There's no doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There aint nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

Storms are ragin' on a rollin' sea
And down the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowin' wild and free
But you aint seen nothin' like me

There aint nothin' that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of this earth for you
Make you happy make your dreams come true
To make you feel my love

*****

I love you so much hermie!  I'm dreaming of you tonight and missing you by my side.

Love,
Lemur"

"event","So Becca is sick with her first of those inevitable children's viruses that make kids miserable for like a week.  The culprit this time: roseola (sp?).  She's got a high fever and has to be on Tylenol and Motrin every 4-6 hours.  No other symptoms but the doctor said that once the fever breaks she'll break out in a measle-like rash.  She's pretty much miserablea and as a result, I am too!  She's not sleeping through the night so I haven't gotten much sleep in about 3 or 4 days.  Miserable.  I know she feels like shit.  The poor thing.  Last night I went in to take care of her when she was crying and she was just burning up.  I've never felt someone's forhead that was so hot.  She's pretty good when she gets up but she only lasts about 2 hours before she wants to sleep.  It's a cycle though because she only sleeps until her meds wear off.  I need to try to time it so that she gets them right before her nap so she'll sleep longer.

Hopefully she'll be feeling better in a day or two.  I'm supposed to have orientation at my new job tomorrow.  I don't know if I can go because Jeff isn't allowed to even be around Becca because he's on the immuno-suppressant drugs.  He can't risk getting sick.  So I have to call my new boss today and find out how long the session is and explain the situation to him.  Hope i don't lose the job but whatever...waitressing jobs are a frickin dime a dozen.  I just don't know how all this is going to work.  Every time she gets sick, I'm not gonna be able to work because Jeff can't be around her when she's sick.  No job is gonna put up with me not being able to work for a week every other month.  Who knows.  

Jeff and I have been having a lot of discussions about what our next step should be.  I REALLY want to move back to Savannah.  We were watching videos of Becca when she was first born and in Savannah.  I remembered how nice it was to be out on our own.  Yeah, we had to worry about money and everything but we had a place that was all our own.  We also have the option of moving to Ohio and living in my grandmother's house.  It's a nice option to not have to pay rent or mortgage but I'm really nervous about it.  The economy there is complete shit and.....I just don't know.  If I could get a job with American Greetings it would totally be the right thing to do.  We'll see what I can do!  Wish us luck on the long road ahead.  We're gonna need it.

In need of much sleep.....

"event","So things seem to be finally settling into a routine and then it's all going to change again.  I'm starting my new job on Thursday- waitressing at Applebee's.  We'll see what happens.  I hope that the training isn't long and drawn out.  I hate it when they put me in some kind of program instead of letting me go at my own speed.  I mean, I've waitressed before so I just have to learn their menu and computer system.  Everything else will pretty much be the same.  I hope I can rake in some big tips!  We need the money SO BAD!

Jeff is working on getting a video shoot together.  I'm so excited for him.  He's so nervous.  It's the first project of this size he's taken on.  Inevitably he's facing lots of self-doubt and fear.  That's such a normal thing.  I know he'll be able to overcome these feelings and everything will turn out amazing!  He's so fucking talented.  I just know he has great things in his future.  I'm still wishing I could get him to Toronto to interview with Cuppa Coffee.  We'll see....

I took Becca to church this morning.  I'd never been to this church before- it was recommended by a friend.  I absolutely loved it.  They had a nursery for Becca.  I took her in and put her on the floor and she just crawled right over to the other kids and started playing.  It was so cool!  I'm so happy for her to have social time with other kids her age.  I think it's so important.  I'd like to maybe start taking her to Gymboree or one of those places now that she's getting old enough.  She just loves being around other kids!  The service was awesome.  It was a praise service with the new age songs- not the old fashioned hymns.  They have these giant screens that they put the words up on and had two guitars and drums and people leading the singing.  Then after the offering and baptism they did today, the lesson was given and it was a video that was about Jesus' life.  THey just showed the part that had to do with the lesson of the day.  Then there was the sermon and more singing and that was it.  I really enjoyed it.  It made me feel so much more connected spiritually than a traditional service.  That's the one thing I really liked about Grove City College (my first college.)  The Tuesday and Thursday morning services were praise services and I loved them!  That was one of the only things I liked about the school. 

Jeff has been having a rough time lately.  He's trying to be so understanding of me but I know things are really hard for him right now.  I wish I knew what to say to make things better for him.  Most of the time I feel so inadequate- like nothing I do can really help him.   I just want the best for him.  I want his life to be everything he ever dreamed of, and I'm so afraid I can't give that to him.  I know it's not my job or even in my power to make it happen, but it's hard to watch the struggle.  I know we'll both get there eventually, I just wish the journey could be a bit easier.  But we will make it happen and it will mean so much more in the end. 

Whew, I've gotten carried away.  

Time to turn in for the night.

"event","So I'm in Ohio visiting my family.  It has been a very strange visit for me.  For one, I have missed Jeff more than I can ever possibly express.  There's just something comforting about having him around.  I am going home tomorrow and I've been trying to really think about what this trip has meant to me.

It's so hard for me because I love my family SO much.  But they really are frustrating.  The first couple of days here I kept cleaning up the kitchen and just trying to get things straighened up.  I feel bad for my mom because she lives with 3 guys (my brothers) and they aren't all that interested in cleaning up after themselves.  I can now understand why she gets so overwhelmed.  It's just a never-ending battle.  It's frustrating to see her struggle the way she does.  It's amazing to me that she doesn't just give up.  I don't know how she does it.  At times I really think she's doing the best that she can with what she has, but at other times I'm just so damn frustrated.  I think things could be so much better for her.  She has a gorgeous house that could be absolutely amazing if it was just taken care of better.  But my brothers, though they try to help, don't really know all that it takes to get things done.  She's afraid to come down on them because they had it so rough with my dad when we were growing up that she doesn't want to do anything that's even going to slightly upset them.  

Then there's my dad.  He has spent pretty much this whole visit bitching about how upset he is that he's not seeing Becca more, and how jealous he is of Jeff's parents because they get to see her every day.  I think he ignores the fact that they are doing so much for us in exchange.  They are sacrificing SO MUCH!  It just blows my mind how generous they are.  They are letting us live with them, not charging us rent or utilities, buying all the groceries for us and Becca (and my god, diapers and formula are fucking expensive!)  Not to mention that they've completely given up their privacy and having their house to themselves, not having to deal with baby clutter and my clutter (and trust me, I am the queen of clutter) I have tried to contain it better but I'm not really very good with it.  It has been so good for me to live with them.  While it has been a major adjustment, it has introduced me to a different way of doing things and I do feel beter prepared for living on our own.  It's amazing how freeing it can be just to get a different perspective.

I am struggling with such opposing feelings.  Utter frustrating for my family, confusion at how I can love them so much but just be so irritated with everything.  I wish for my brothers and mom that they could just have the opportunity to step out of their comfort zones and get a different perspective.  I really think it would make all the difference.  I love them so much and only want the best for them.  

Maybe more later.  Little Becca Boo is needing my attention.

Peace and Love,
Jennifer"

I have been laying World of Warcraft for the past 7 hours. I didn't check my email as I do daily. At about 3A.M., I do. There is an email from eBay claiming my account has been indefinitely suspended. Hmm... So, I click the link in the email and log in. Weird... The fonts are all smallish and hard to read, for me at least. I close out the link, but because I'm both weird AND dumb, I then try to log back into eBay. My account is fine... Usually when typing in a password or etc. it says that the account is suspended. Now, tell me for yourselves... Go go on eBay and see if the username ""ChemicalDuckProductions"" has been suspended. Well...?

My day was going pretty damn quietly... Lunchtime rolls saround for me at about 5P.M. and Joanne comes up to me. (Here we go.) She suggests that she wants sto talk to me and the other techs, but doesn't feel she has the patience to talk to all of us together. I mean, we were in different rooms... Anyhow, I got her to spit it out and this is what I've found...

It seems that someone has stated to her and Michael that the techs, all three of us, seemingly use Michael's office for our leisure when he isn't there... We put our feet up on the desk, munch on candy, read the paper, and even close the door... Now, I will tell you that I already know who said it and even asked... Of course she wouldn't say. (Lynn and Sesha...) The funny thing is how much I dislike these two. I wouldn't say hate because hate is such a strong word, but if I found out that a flight of stairs malfnctioned causing them to topple to their demise I would smile. Oops did I say that? Yes, I did.

Yeah, so consider me outraged... When I asked her about it Joanne changed heer story and said that it's about EVERYONE and not just the techs. Wait a second... Didn't I clearly ask her why just the techs earlier in the conversation? Yes... And her answer... ""Because they were the ones complained about..."" Good story change... 

Rant, over.

- There are a few places available in Ann Arbor, but due to shitty ass college season they are only available to August. We will see what happens there. Due to the fact that weird folk read this LJ I'm not giving the exact locations.

I left wrok early because I was so close to an emotional breakdown. The stress in my life is about the highest it has ever been. Here is what I may possibly have on my plate...

On April 1st I move back in with my Grandmother, pay off my bills, buy another car, and then worry about a place to live...

OR

On April 1st move in with Sarah and her friends in Ann Arbor, transfer my job out there, and then worry about a car...

Thiis is getting so stressful and tough.

There is one thing I didn't want to post here due to the privateness of it, but I will now...

The thing that set me over the top today is that the same woman who called me before, about my Dad, called again to let me know that his funeral was today. She also wouldn't tell me where it was, but that I should know it was happening. I have no sense what I should feel or say to this. I'm so confused at this.

The only person that hass been there for me through all of this is Sarah. To be honest, without her support or understanding I would have O.D.ed again by now. I mean seriously, in the matter of one week I lost my car, living arrangements, Father I have hardly ever seen, and what was the hopes of a nice friendship. We'll not talk about the later. There is only so much stress one body can take.

I work 11-8 tomorrow instead of 10-7. I wonder why.

Sarah is going to come over to keep me company and to be honest, I can't wait. I am very stricken on money right now, but for some reason I want to give. 

Im thinking about seeing if Verizon will sponsor me so that I can participate in the Breast Cancer walk coming up here in July or so. For some reason they charge you to participate. Yeah, $2100. That's insane for being able to take myself and walk 60 miles. Heh. I'd like to do it though; it supports a good cause.

Another thought partially crossed my mind earlier today. Going back to school. Wow... Before I get too old that is. I have no idea what my major would be. It'd either be something to do with computers or photography. Maybe I'll combine the two and go with digital photography of some sort. We will see.

For some reason I'm really down today. I'm feeling really ugly, in a sense. With no offense to Sarah it seems like I have had a real lack of female attention lately. Everyone of the opposite gender I am around seemingly is just putting up with me. No, no, I'm not saying they have to be attracted to me or etc., but it seems like I am always getting the cold shoulder from them. Does my personality come off that way at all? I dunno. Someone... Help...? I need opinions right about now. *Shrugs.*

Other than that all seems fine... I mean, paintball last Sunday went okay. Ray had more fun then I did. Maybe it is because my marker seems a little bit slower than his when in all relaity it should be fasster... Ten times faster.

I wasn't invited to Christmas and wasn't called on my birthday because I wasn't wanted...

They'ree broke."" (I had tested the chargers prefusely over the course of twenty minutes.) Anyhow, she started yelling at me and tell ing me to ""actually test them"" and ""plug them in and lay them flat"". I stop her... I raise my finger... And without a word click the charger into one of her phones. Now, I must stop and say that the electrical sockets at Verizon are about two and a half feet off the ground. Without taking my eyes off of her, I smiled and let go of her phone. A loud ""WHAP"" followed. The phone had smacked the wall... Her response, ""Oh, now your just atttude."" I asked Chi to take over. Meanwhile several customers and fellow employees giggled. (I later got commended on howw funny it was and I was ""right"".)

"event","Well, with a large ""buzz"", I brought in the New Year. (Also my birthday.) I didn't see my parents or family for Christmas, nor did I see them for my birthday either. It sort of sucked, but I've come to accept a new family that actually wants me. They know who they are. Hell, they're the only people that seemingly give a shit.

Here are a few obligations I have to myself this upcoming year:

- Settling myself back into school.
- Finishing the work I've started on my teeth.
- Staying with my current employer. (If I pass a year it will be a record for me.)
- Participating in more paintball tournaments and etc. in regard to the sport.

Yeah... Why did I buy that gun when there is SO much more I could have used it for? Because it's something I'm good at... Ad not to toot my own horn, but... I'm really fucking good at it. I owned people at this last tournament, and that was with a mechanicl gun... I was the only one there with a fucking mechanical gun... Gawd this sport rules.

So, anyhow, what did I do? Well, I had a few glasses of champagne with Laura, Sarah, and Ray... And then Ray and I got completely trashed. Oh, and sex ensued. Well, not with Ray, but with Sarah. Dear God was it good. he-he Oh, and it was fun waking her up too. ::High-fives self.::

I got a beautiful cake from Sarah and that was quite frankly all I needed. I had my friends and in the long run that's all I care about.

Oh, and I got a call from Ray's sister... Oh, and my boy Terrell at work. They both called to say happy birthday. And how can I forget my fellow neighbors!?!? They both came up, Jesse and his wife, to celebrate with us and to say happy birthday. It was cool.

Last year at this time my life was at it's end, but now I've come to relaize that it was only at it's beginning. I've found what I need and learned what it is to make myself happy above anything else. I've fought for myself over the year and to be honest, I'm quite happy with it. I'm just going to keep it going like it is for now.

Oh, and some of you would be very happy to know that I don't steal anymore... I've become a good boy. Wow, it has actually been quite awhile. I wanna say last March, max? Dear God... No more for me... Everything is earned now.

Yeah, I own this! It fires at 31bps (Balls per second) and that's ""stock"". My old marker could only fire at about 12bps. Dear God am I going to shred people with this fucking thing. Good way to spend $950 if you ask me... Now, I only have to spend about $600 more...

Ownage will ensue.

She brought them all over tonight too. I got a Stitch! (Awesome as all hell!) I got a Donnie Darko hoodie! (It's got his skeleton on it from the movie.) Oh, and some kick ass earrings because my holes sort of closed up and I need to re-stretch them back out. I'm dually impressed.

I love this girl. Quite frankly we have been through a ton of shit together... I'm very happy right now, gifts aside.

"event","Ray and I have evenly decided that he will be following my ""footsteps"" in the ways of a high-end marker. Roughly, it will be a grand total of about $1500 when done...

Oh, and it may go one of two routes... Either start from scratch or purchase an $1100 gun and destroy it, i.e. spending another $700, and making it better.

Ah, well... Some call us crazy, but we have decided that we are actually ""normal""... Well, if that's a god thing now-a-days.

----- ----- ----- ----- -----

Now and actual update. Ya' know, I ran through editing my Info for this site and noticed that one person popped up as having me on their Friends list... Yeah, her. I suppose I don't understand it in the least, and quite frankly I'm giving it that label. It's sort of weird... How long has it been? I think it'ss going on about a year now come Jan. 3rd? Dear God... Let it go... I did.

I've filled my life up with the sport of paintball, work, Ray, and general talk to calm the days... It's fun. I will be honest and say that it sucks being without female companionship on certain days, but I live... I make myself stronger with each coming day... And besides, it's fun flirting... I just realized that I'm a slut... A lil' bit of a man-whore... Sort of like Mr. Slave in a recent episode of SouthPark, but without the anal cavity/Paris Hilton combo. Meow.

Here's another sad piece of news... And it hurts... It really does, so whether you people believe me eor not is your call, but whatever... Ray and I have been throwing around the idea of either moving to Colorado (65%) or New York (35%). We want to open a paintball field and right around Aspen is where we are looking... I dunno how soon that will come though, but that would mean that I will be leaving all I know... Everyone... Yes, once again I say, ""everyone""... That is going to suck, but I have no clue... Dear God... Ah, man...

I've been sucked into the magical world of xBox Live... Halo2, Greg Hasting's Tournament Paintball, and Need For Speed: Underground 2. Oh, and World of Warcraft for PC. (It's an MMORPG.) Ray is right around with me in the ring of corruption...

I'm ending this post because a.) I'm rambling AND&nbsp;b.) All talkie-talkie, no sleepy-sleepy.

To sum it up, my computer took a massive shit. (Oh, yeah, it was awesome!) Oh, and here is some of that straight truth bullshit I've been mentioning:

What I've told people about the last year of my life, mostly from Illinoiss, is a lie. I don't own a fucking house... I don't have some high-paying job... Oh, and why would I own a new Mustang? I mean... Eww...

What I do have:

An apartment with most likely the best male I've ever known. (No, this does not make me gay you sick 'tards.) This boy is my brother and I will do anything for him. I work for a company that supplies technicians to Verizon Wireless. (As of Febuary I'm switching!) Oh, and I love every person I work with. I drive the same old red car that people last saw me in, but hopefully in the months to come will be changing that to a new car.

That sums it up... Well, as far as I want to talk ton ight anyhow.

- Work... I'm getting tired. It's fun as shit and I love the people I work with, but I'm doing it non-stop... Dear God... Help.

- Paintball... Something needs to happen. I love the people I play with, but in a way, it's so unpredicatble. I like being there when a lot of people are... I like to go in and have fun.

Anyhow, so after signing online I notice that either Sarah unblocked me or something... But I read her Away message and it says something to the effect of her needing to talk to me because ""we"" have a problem... Yeah? Like what? ::Sigh.:: I thought I was done with this drama shit. I also noticed that she deleted her LJ. (Then knowing her, she most likely has a new one.) So, I wonder what she has to say that could involve us and be oh, so inmportant? If anything, she can email me or just talk to me online. I'm sure she'll read this.

Wow... Training was fun this past Wensday. I got to see the whole original training crew... Oh, and there's a picture of me drunk on a reclining chair in the hotel flipping off the chick who took it. Oh, the fun... Yeah, I was reminded of how drunk I was at the metting too. Go me! ::Laughs.::

My ""No, don't steal anymore"" theft class is the gayest... I mean... Seriously... Of all the people there, I got the lowest sentence. Some poor sap there didn't pay for his dinner at a Chinese buffet and ran out... The cops caught him and sentenced him to 10 days in jail, 2 years probation, and about $600 in fines. A little overboard me thinks. ::Shrugs.:: Other than that there is a Russian chick there that's rather cute... Well, in a way... I found out her name was ""Olga"". Dear...

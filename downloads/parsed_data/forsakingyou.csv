"event","Well me and Daniel broke up. Well I broke up with him but.. I guess I'm just not ready for a relationship right now. I thought I was but apparently not. I think he hates me. I don't think he's really..mad. but more upset. What do you want me to do?! Force my feelings? Thats horrible. Besides, being single is so much fun. Dude, his friends bet him 5 bucks to smack my ass. He had to ask my cousin if he should or shouldn't. I was pissed but I didn't tell him. I hate perverted guys like that. Another friendship ruined because of me. Fun stuff. What else is new? I'm always screwing up. And I'm always so tired. I just want to.. fly away to somewhere new. And see if anyone will accept me for who I am and not what I believe in. But I guess on the bright side, this kid named Jake who rides my bus hang out. He's like ""Molly, will you be my 5th best friend?"" I thought it was kinda cute. But I don't like him like that. Besides, he has a girlfriend. It seems whenever Karlee is around, they kinda ignore me. Oh well..."

"event","Me and Robbie are good, thank GOD. It relieves a lot.. But. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm having a hard time remembering Roland and who he actually was. I was so upset wanting him back, I don't remember why. Maybe memories overlap. I don't know. But who was Roland? He was 17. He was my ""big brother"". He lived in NY. He touched my life and made it better. But then he left. I don't know what to feel anymore. Is it because I'm numb? Or am I just over reacting a lot? I thought I moved on.. Blocking him out of my life, without even realizing it. Have I forgotten Roland? No.. because I'm talking about him right now. Ugh this is so stupid! Why did he leave!? I was doing okay until he left! He started all of this.. NO. I cannot think this! I don't even know why he left.. Which is why I have the right to be angry! He hasn't said a word! But maybe no one will let him on! Well then he should go to Kait and ask! But what if their not friends? She never said they weren't friends. GOD I'm so lost.."

Laura:  lemme check
Laura:  I have no idea. u_U
Laura:  maybe he has AIM?
Me:  -Frowns- Maybe.. 
Me:  You think he's avoiding us? 
Laura:  no, I think he gave up on the computer.
Laura:  he was such a brilliant guy :\
Me:  Yeah.. 
Laura:  but he disappeared long ago
Me:  I just thought...you know. He could e-mail me. And say he's doing okay. 
Me:  You dont just come in someones life like that and leave.. 
Laura:  maybe his parents or whoever hes living with don't allow him on
Me:  Probably his uncle.. But I mean.. -Sigh- I thought I was over this. And I said ""If I look in his profile, and see nothing, then he's not coming back and I have to take him off my BL."" But when I saw his icon, it hit me.. 
Laura:  I have no idea whats going on there.
Me:  I don't know if it's just..an error or something. But whatever it is, it's making me angry.. 
Me:  Because sometimes it's not there and other times it is. 
Laura:  technical difficulties
Me:  But I mean you'd think if it was school work and everything making him avoid the computer, he would come on at least once in the summer. 
Laura:  yeah... well all I can say is the chance of him coming back has already been squashed. so we'll have to live without him u_u
Me:  He left at the beginning of the worst part of my life, so far. u_u; I hope he's okay. He worries the sh_t out of me everyday 
Laura:  sorry u_u
Me:  -Sigh- Whatever floats his boat, I guess. But do you think if he had the chance to come back, he would? 
Laura:  of course o_o
Me:  Well the way Tin is acting.. I don't think he'd want to find out what he left behind.. 
Me:  I know I've changed and I know you have, as well. 
Laura:  you still chat with Tin? ^_^
Me:  Sorta. We've grown distant from each other, I guess. Our views on how Roland left are different.. Well at least how they were. I have no idea. I try to talk to her, but she doesn't really give any effort. 
Laura:  what does she say about Roland? like why he doesn't come on?
Me:  She says he betrayed us.. and abandoned us. I said she didn't know why he left at all so she couldn't assume that so quickly. I went through a series of stages.. I think she's standing by her opinion though.  
Laura:  she doesn't know for sure, I think shes being silly.

That was me and Laura's conversation about Roland."

I bet she thinks I'm a total freak, though.. Everyone says what I'm saying is stupid. I think I'm ugly because I know it's true. But everyone keeps telling me I'm not. I wish they would STOP. I hate it when they do that and tell me right from wrong. I HATE IT. I'm a big girl! I can accept the truth for f_cking sake. God I hate my life.. I'm a total freak. And whenever I am happy I'm annoying. So there's no real point. I'm just a creation that never worked. Sometimes, I don't want to wake up. Sleep divides the way from reality.. I feel so sleepy all the time. But I do like C:KND. It's fun.. James is really nice. He's helping me out and besides.. I only know of 3 big 1/3 fans. Kirsten drew me a really good 1/3 fanart..

On Tuesday we went to Devil's Slide. It's just a dirt mountain/hill that you can climb up. But it's really hard because so many people go up, it's all coming apart. On Wednesday we went down a MUD slide. At first I didn't want to go down, but they came up with buckets of muddy water for those who wouldnt go down so I had no choice. I had gone down previous years though. But it was fun. On Thursday we went swimming at a water park with water slides and on Friday, yesterday, we went on a self hike. HARD STUFF. I got a headache from it. But I met some really cool peoples. Sarah, Ethan, Rachel, Ben and Taylor. We all have this thing by calling everyone a failure. Lol it was fun. But it was obvious my other friend Sara who always goes with me (not Sarah) that Ethan and her liked each other :B But he got a girlfriend so she got really sad. But then he broke up with her yesterday and she was all happy. xD I was like ""nice."" I hope he's alright. But I got along more with Rachel because we both like Nickelback and rock music. So does Ben but he was kinda a loser lol. On Friday this kid was being really annoying and so she mocked him by saying ""you have an ugly face, thats not fair!"" I started cracking up! So hilarious. Then it started raining and shes like ""I can see the rain! I never get to do that and I would always get mad."" Rachel, you're awesome. But you're all failures. We might do something next weekend like go see Anchorman. It looks funny <3 That's all for now. I miss Kari ;_; And Joey. I got a letter from him, yesterday.

Hey everyone. This is my first entry in this journal. My name is Molly Schuetz. I live in Omaha, Nebraska and I'm 13 years old. I have a mom, a dad and a sister named Lindsey. My parents are divorced. I do not have a boyfriend. But my friends irl are: Sara, Lindsee, Kirsten and Daniela. My friends online are: Joey, Tin, Kari, and Ricky. I don't have many friends that I consider friends. But those are the people who I love very much. I started out being a very bright and happy person. But things change and so do people. People have pushed me around so much in my life, I can't take it anymore. I love solitude. I only know a few people who have gotten me through some of the worst times of my life. And still I sit here wondering what I would have done without them. I probably would have not of been here if it wasn't for them. One of those people is Roland. I loved him. Not as a lover, but as a family member. He was my older brother that I never had. I never got hugs from my mom or anyone. I was expected to be the best I could be. And yet I felt as if they were telling me to be the best. Not that I could be. But as I grew up, I didn't want to be the good girl anymore. He took my hands and told me it was okay. He told me to let it all go. And I did. But he disappeared from me. He was the person that led me through the dark cave of Life. I was able to see the light at the end of the path. But that exit caved in. He's gone. I can't..see anymore. It's too dark."

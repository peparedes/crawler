"event","What an interesting week to say the least. Kristina came out of the blue yet again, and w my new found desire to be clearheaded a majority of the time - I'm able to umm interract in an enriching way. We had lunch one day, I got phone calls IM, even more cool no matter how geeky sounding - I kissed her and felt something back. Yea of course anytime you kiss someone you feel some attraction or else wtf would you be kissing them, but this was different. I felt her. It was cool to say the least. God I missed that - but it still does not change the fatc she is w Nick no matter how she bitches lol Them's the facts!

Onto better things - Played the Middle East in Boston MA downstairs for the first time ever. All I can say is WOW..they know how to treat a fucking band. Pro sound, Free Food, Free Drinks (though I don't drink this is invaluable to the average musician) and great fucking times! First off we opened the show..and rawked the motherfuckin' hizouse for an opener. Received nothing but compliments on the band and even me - holy fucking shit! Still working on the off stage persona thing as I am the furthest thing ever from a rockstar - though I love the attn, I never know wtf to say. I never used to be that way lol

Went to a party at Adam's place after and that was interesting to say the least as well - Different people from all walks of life. Unfortunately for me, I have this disease that only lets me relate to people I can identify w...so say your average joe ultra smart Boston college kid, I feel awkward talking to. Having my boys (the band) there made all the difference and as soon as they got back from the Taco Bell run it was on! Of course then again I was rawking post smoke paranoia ultra hard. Not the best for a shy kid -

All in all a great weekend. I still have to take care of Katie and Julia's money sit. (my kid's mom and my daughter), but I have a line on a job thru a temp agency - even if it is something crappy. I need the money bottom line. And now - I'm going to read or relax and watch a movie. WTF is going on? Read? Relax? Next thing I'll be saying is better days are coming lol....- rawk the fuck on -"

"event","Ever feel like you don't know how to talk? To quote the band Atreyu - "" It's even harder to speak when everything you say just comes out wrong..."" Yea I kinda feel like that. I want to open up but can't. An even better quote from Poison the Well - ""There isn't much to open up for. I want to be excited just haven't been educated yet. Wonder how long it will take before they leave me...""

I'm sick of this melancholy feeling. Not much makes me feel anything, the times I am happy are few and far in btwn. Band/Music, Working out - Lisa, Doug, the band, my daughter alot of the times, which at times is emotionally draining seeing as she is growing and I am suppose to guide her. Truth is half the time I can't even fucking guide myself. I'm sick of being a fraction of what I used to be and not having any reason as to why things are this way. Just knowing shit went sour on a 3 yr downturn and I haven't been the same since. 

Ultimately the thing that would bring me happiness, I don't even know how to achieve. And really do all my answers lie in another person? I mean that's not realistic but still I can't help but feel I'd be more complete, something better than what I am now if I had kind words, a warm heart and a girl who understood me...unrealistic? probably...The one time I did find it, it eventually turned sour.

I'm in an extremely contemplative mood so forgive the deepness. I feel like a freak for feeling like this..like no one feels like this and would just look at me funny. Like looking for the one hand to pull me out of the water from drowing but all I see are cold faces staring, never connecting. I have chills as I write this. So glad I haven't smoked...*sarcasm* At least I'd be able to enjoy shit lol. It doesn't help I got to bed at 5:30 and was awoken at 10:15am - to top it off, being stranded at the house and not having a car.

I was suppose to go to ME w Adam to party but no dice - no car - no life. Fucking loser. I'm sick of feeling like this. Is this what it's going to be like for the next 2 yrs of being a student? Cause this fucking blows. I hope my band does something and goes somewhere. The shitty part is I can't put any faith in that because you never know what will happen but at the same time you have to enjoy every moment. A very fine bullshit line.

Sometimes I think I'd be better dead than unhappy - cause this is no way to go through life. Lonely, cold, and numb. I'm tired of having to hold myself up. Just want to rest my head for a little while..wish someone would save me..."

"event","It's been a little bit. Stilll fucking jobless though I did apply to a temp agency. Thing is you have to show up there at 5:30 in the am. On top of that to continue living the way I do (food wise) I'd have to wake up at 4am, 4:30 maybe if I didn't mind rushing - just to cook so I could have the foods I need on a schedule. 5:30am as the start of your day is not conducive to making an album.

So that whole thing about Kristina - yea...turned out to be a lie to get me all jealous. it worked and fired me up to be like fuck this girl. She is messed. She keeps trying to speak to me like all is good. Still I want her - physically anyway. Any sort of hope I had of ever being w her is dead - killed by her. Maybe I jsut don't/didn't understand the situation w Nick - but I don't really care. It's not worth it unless she proves something different to me. But I'm not going out of my way to look for it like I once would have...

So the show went really well. I was so freaked out and man - I don't think I've ever felt more naked and scared to be on a stage,. But it was good cause it made me think alot. Slowly I'm growing back into those old shoes. Have to take advantage while the day is here. Can't wait til this cd is done! Things are sounding really really well, but you know me - I can never be satisfied w my writing and continue wanting to push the envelope. Good news is my shit is sounding way less derivative (to me) bad news is - it's so different I don't know if I'm playing or good stuff...but some of the stuff has caught my ear and I need the help of the guys for arrangement/direction. I have ideas but nothing pressing - usually my best ideas come out as a collab of what we come up w together.

All in all - life is well...oh supposedly my school is paid for by Financial Aid which would be rad. If I get the amount they said I will, I'll have money for pressing my share of cds. Now I just need some money and to keep busy.

"event","Ok first off - not every girl = a bitch. But the ones that do...this does apply.

I spent so much damn time updating this journal w the soap opera known as Kristina (or Bitchtina or Cuntina as I like to call her now) Found some dirt out that puts this whole thing in perspective.

Turns out she's been hooking up w one of her other exes Ry Ry as she calls him, or Ryan as normal people would call him. Typical white hat guy but whatever. At least I got some closure - thing that sucks is - I had to hear it from her friend. And how Kristina is going to take Ryan to my first show back w Farewell Radiance. Fucking petty ass shit. Can't leave me the fuck alone cause she gets off on drama.

So I said fuck it - I spilled everything I thought about her - good and bad. I called her out on the fact she stays w Nick for Emotional and Financial stability but fucks around on him cause she's not happy. I siad she has a good heart when she wants to - it's too bad she chooses not to. I said fuck that girl - she's not worth my time, thought, or emotion. I said she sucks.

The best part? She saw it all. She's been writing shitty messages to me on my away message - shit like thanks for talkin shit, and the first one was Just wanted to say hi - I'd say my name but I hear I make you sick....I felt bad about that as what I said got twisted. I said thinking about her makes me sick, and at the time - I had good cause for not wanting to think of her. So I went to clarify and found all that out. Nice huh?  Guess the truth hurts cause I said nothing more than that. I can admit my flaws and wrongs when they happen. Guess she can't. Girls like that love the drama. She gets off on it I swear.

If she comes w Ryan - oh man...I get chills. It makes me laugh - how shitty the human condition can be.  I simply think of the good people and things in my life and all this bs goes away - and it gives me the strength to laugh. What else could I do? Say goodbye to the $5 whore...

On a good note - working out is going great, writing down eveyrthign I eat and counting my calories. I can actually see stomach muscles! 

Sara (Wisconsin) may be coming out here 2nd week of August which would rawk for sure...And I met a girl who listens to Hardcore/Metal and works at GNC. It's meant to be...=) Just fucking kidding....but I will tyr to hook that up. Fuck it - life is too short. Bullshit like the type written above is what makes me realize this. 5 Yrs in a relationship of ups and downs and shitty shitty downs has made me realize this. Being a Dad has made me realize this and resurrecting umpteen bands from the dead has made me realize this. Yea buddy!"

"event","Well it's been a bit. Haven't been up to much. Just working out and eating like a fucking pig - but good foods of course. I actually seem to be getting more in shape and more umm as homo as this sounds - muscular. I care about that stuff and it makes me feel better. As well it keeps me from smoking all the time. Though the past few days I have been indulging. =( Gotta work on that - but I'm doign well.

This week - applied for 2 jobs (lol) Got turned down for one, but I'll be kept in mind and my app. on file. Thanks guy! *sarcasm off* Learned Christianity may be a crock. Gee what surprise another ""moral"" thing shown for what it is. Does not anyone in this world have values and morals? Maybe I sound like a bitch but the way people treat each other downright disgusts me at times. Though the times people do wonderful things like save a little girl trapped in a well, or raise money for cancer research in honor of so and so etc - it goes to show people can do some amazing things.

Last night I was high and thought about aliens and if they were what we could become - if people would unite and such, but because we're stuck in our selfish, selfcentristic ways - we'll never be able to achieve some amazing things like - perhaps the aliens did. I know I know dumb. But like I said I was high and it makes for an itneresting argument.

Demo is sounding AMAZING! Can't wait to get this bitch mixed up next Monday...

I guess on a final note - I'm realizing i'm still pretty pissed abotu things. I read that depression is simply repressed anger. Makes alot of sense. So from now on - I'm just going w it. I was brought up to believe showing anger was bad - or this was instilled in me through beatings anytime I got mad. For the first time in my life I'm letting myself be mad and it's ok. Thank God for the music - cause if I didn't have it...I wouldn't have any peace."

"event","Well - it's the tail end of another day. A pretty good day - err should I say not a bad day so a good day by default? A lil boring as I sat around for the first 1/2 of my day but working out and hanging w Lisa was cool. Lisa is my first love ever (lol how dumb) and one of my closest confidants. We are fellow stoners...she umm brought my inner stoner out - which there def. was one w my upbringing lol. Felt good to take a step out of my head, take a breath and go ok this is bs, this is bs and that is bs - this is what I need to do....

I had called Kristina at work - deciding I was going to have it out - fuck this no explanation, no clues, no answers shit on why she had blown me off, and had been slowly ditching out on me - and why she fucking bothered to come back in my life and throw that ""L"" word around. Fuck that - that is false and insincere. I more or less was biting my tongue hard and she prob could tell cause of my snotty tone. Fuck it - I was pissed. And I spoke nicely minus the attitude in my voice. Even apologized cause he district mgr was there. She told me to call her at 5:30. I never did. 

Upon my smoke break, I realized this girl brings out some unhealthy shit in me. She leaves me feeling like shit in some way 9 out of 10x. Maybe more. The initial 2 weeks of bliss and the 1 prospective hook-up are NOT worth this fucking bs.

While I'm at it - what's up w fucking people? Specifically - we'll mention girl A - no one mentioned this far in any of these entries. Just a friend and not someone I am overly attracted to. I actually I am unnattracted to her quite honestly - physically anyhow. However mentally she's a freak and it's cool and we talk perv. shit to each other. Fun to pass the time. Anyhow we hooked up once and it was good - just I left feeling dirty/compromised (duh on my part but what can I say, school of hard knox calls) and we ended up not talking for a bit. Last night she starts up w the talk again. Ok whatever. At this point offering me sex is like throwing a hamburger in front of an Ethiopian. (lol) She gets off or whatever and then all of a sudden it's like - you served your purpose, I'll talk to you at my convenience. 

Now not to sound like a bitch, and I'm sure I do from these weeping ass entries (lol), but how many yrs did women (and still do) complain about their ""mate"" not cuddling, not talking, etc All I'm looking for was coversation and I gotta get attitude after getting you off w my mad skillz? lol I keed I keed - ok 1/2 but...seriously. Maybe I'm naive but I grew up believing women were these sweet, caring, creatures - not selfish, self serving heartless pieces of shit. WTF still the few good ones are worth it. it's the weeding process that sucks a fat cock.

God I'm poetic tonight. =)

"event","Well I feel kinda bad. I was totally flipping out yesterday. Anxiety attacks - the whole 9. I haven't had a bad anxiety attack in forever. I guess in combination w this diet, not getting enough food so I couldn't cook cause the floor in the kitchen is being done thus no stove or fridge, and life problems (read past entries lol - girls, creditors, no future etc), strong weed from the night and same day - it all got to me. It's not even like I wanted to be all pissy. Couldn't help it - even had to aks for help watching my daughter cause I couldn't handle myself. It's scary when it gets like that. 

Today I had a long talk w my mom. And seeing my daughter did make me feel better. It's amazing being human at times. How something so minute can be the worst thing in the world and you want to die, then the next day you have the clarity to be like - wtf was I so upset for. It's kinda cathartic I guess. Of course it'd help if I was seeing some productive work coming out of the studio but I think Will (engineer/studio owner) needed a deserved break. He's got his own probs going on. He started flying off the handle a bit. But I'm starting to realize maybe his and I working together - well we are alot alike..sorta like watching myself from the outside. He is a wicked nice guy but if he feels like he is getting walked on BAM - he let's it fly...

Oh well - hopefully eveyrthing turns out right. I'm doing my best to just be happy. Put all these probs in perspective.

Oh one last thing - I talked to Laura the other day online and she has been trying to reach me - trying to be friedns w me, which is weird. It was kinda funny getting to be a dick and being like what good could come of it, we have our own lives, we're different people yada yada yada It opened a can of feelings I hadn't fully dealt w - and still haven't fully dealt w. I guess I thought she was going to be there forever. 5 yrs and my life was going really well. She was like the Step Mom to my daughter, taught me about being a Dad and really helped, I had the good job - then slowly Fall 2002 that all went to shit. By December/January our relationship was in the shitter and the last few mos. through June/July were spent babysitting and arguing and going on the vacation from hell. Sadly enough I miss the people that made me miserable but it wasn;'t meant to be.

Thing is when I got laid off from CTC 2002 (fall) I thought I would feel better. On to bigger and better things. But instead I felt worse and w Maria Crocco (Laura's best friend Marisa's Mom and a super super sweet woman - one of THE nicest people I've ever met in my life) dying of Leukemia - she wasn't there (understandably so) but even after the fact she wasn't there and things never went back to the same. Suddenly the safe family place I always wanted was dissappearing before my eyes....Life goes on - suck it up =)"

Made it a guarantee to hang...no call..no show...I feel like a chump. I'm sure i'd get some lame excuse...Nick came home early...I was sick....I thought you were going to call..heard these all before. Usually it's on little stuff - but today was like set in stone and you could take her word for it. Obviously not. 

Spoke w Sara today which was nice. Starting to realize I'm pretty tweaked to start anything w a ""nice"" girl like I really want. Somehow, no doubt in large part to Laura Lee my ex fiancee, I trust it less. But I'm working on opening up more. The last thing I want to be is some embittered old fuck.

"event","So things actually went as planned yesterday. It was actually pretty cool and I didn't expect much thus prob. why I was surprised w what did happen. To refresh you it's been awhile since I've had steady conversation w Kristina. It turns out I guess Nick was giving her a bunch of shit about me so she decided to lay low - whilst not telling me! Thanks hun! But this prompted me to say somethign along the lines of - ""your communication has gotten any better lol"" At which point she busted my balls about assurance, and I was like motherfucker! I haven't seen 1 sign since we've been talking! 

Oh forgot to mention we were laying down in my bed while this conversation was going on. Next thing I know she is telling me my hand on her back felt nice and it was the first glimmer of hope. Next thing you know her hands going one way and yea it didn't go super anywhere but it was a def. fluffable sign for things to come! I said something about wanting her but she couldn;t due to ""monthly constraints"" I said next time and she said maybe...but left me w something to think and smile about.

God just writing about it I get a smile on my face. I hope we get back to where we were someday cause once upon a time it felt really great to my heart. She still does. But things aren't right right now - so I will wait for my day - if and when that happens. Sometimes I think it takes more strength to not say I love you than it does to say it. God it feels good to smile..."

The end result - a lil fatter, a lil more bla and a lil less motivated Rai who is kinda jonesing for some though he knows it's bad for his lungs and wallet. I really need to hold out til this weekend for my b day but it's tough. The only thing that keeps me going is the music thing. Great practice yesterday. Things w Kristina are pretty much down to a slow crawl. We barely talk though she says she has days off on Wed and Thurs and wanted to do something. I can only imagine what will come up now. Last week it was food poisoning and Nick coming home early. Mark my words something will happen. I swear why can't people be straight up - don't sit there and be like I love you - then do every action to contradict that. I'd rather hear it ain't ever happening again - and move on w my merry fucking little life. Grrr...

Well studio - maybe I'll smoke to kill the time til then. Oh and i may be going to Michigan in 2 weeks. Anywhere but here sounds good. I wonder what will happen w Amanda on Thurs as she wanted to get together. Oh also Sara sounded weird on the phone and kinda rushed me off. Another dude? perhaps - wtf cares at this point *lights pipe*

Katie made it home. Let me know she made it home safely. She left a message on the answering machine asking if I was going to see Julia.

I have an interview for a decent job tomorrow - 2 actually...one w the hiring mgr, one w the recruiter and I have some testing to do. On top of that, my boy Kage said he'd vouch for me I did an internship w him for Park Capital...pretty cool.

Things w Kristina haven't improved any, and I haven't really talked to Sara much in the past few days. Kristina and I were supposed to get together today but she called me up and was like I was sick all night. I have no reason to doubt it, but even if she was telling the truth - something is saying stay the fuck away lol! You'd think the bf would be the first sign but I'm a stubborn fuck..=) 

As for Sara - I'm not sure if she gets my point about the whole promising me something, then contradicting that - and why I have my doubts. She was actually pissed at me for getting pissed (which I wasn't - big difference btwn hurt and pissed) However the more I try to clarify, the more annoyed she seems. Guilt? (haha what an asshole I am) maybe...who knows but I think it's selfish of her to be pissed at me for being hurt? For christ's sakes - people feel the way they feel. You can't control that. Could be a sing of things to come.

On a side note I got in touch w this girl Amanda I've known for a few yrs as well and we are supposed to spend some time next weekend. Being single can be fun!

"event","Yea my kids mom in un-fucking-believable. So I type up a letter basically documenting what is happening. About how she is asking for $700 and all this despite the fact I had paid for Julia's Health insurance from Nov-Jan - she wants to charge me $21 a week through that time period...right - I gave her $400 and worded up that letter. It basically said I let her know about the insurance and the fact I had insurance was made available to her by me. But I am paying $400 twds back pay despite the fatc I dispute her figure of $700 - to cover my ass should it come up courtwise. So you know what she does - while admitting to me she was afraid Julia's dr wasn't in the network - she says can I write on this? She writes Katie LeBlanc was not awear (how she spelled it swear to God) of health insurance. - Call me a fucking liar in the letter and smile to my face why don't you?

I was so fucking overwhelmed w a sick feeling in my stomach I said whatever and said my goodbyes and left on good terms or she she thought. I don't even want to deal w the psycho bitch...So I took the letter - added my own addendum and said I dispute the fact she was unaware of health ins. and that she had added that after I had signed the letter. Does she think she is that much smarter, is she nuts or does she think the fact she wears a smile while fucking me - is going to throw me from the fact she is fucking me?

On top of that she gave me some crappy log she has been keeping of all my visits w Julia. I can't even tell you the lies printed in there. Some of the shit is true like when I would come the next morning - but I shit you not, not one good thing in there - all neg. to make me look like an asshole should it ever come up in court. Lets not talk about Mothers Day when I dropped julia back off and she came home - hair all disheveled, close wrinkled in some strange dudes truck as I dropped Julia off....Way too look in front of your kid..Thank God Julia had no clue but wtf - yet she can write - Ray was w some girl and brought Julia home w no shoes....right....that is real fucking fair.

And the sad thing is - when my kid is w her she acts like the biggest brat. it breaks my heart and It makes me not want to be around when she is like that. It scares me for the future.

The whole thing makes me so sick, it really makes me not want to be alive at times. I'm so sick of shitty people and having my heart broken and people like that scumbag mother of my daughter trying to take advantage of me. People who mistake kindness for weakness can suck a dick. I hope she faces up for the emotional shit she has put me through on her day od judgement. God is the one thing that is pulling me through in all of this - and I'm not even religious - but rather spiritual. 

And I have to ask - why have I been given this plate of shit? Thank God for my friends. My friend Barb said you can set goals but don't expect much and you'll be pleasantly surprised. She is absolutely right and i knew all this. Why can;t you remember dumb syaing when you are pissed as all hell lol?

Sometimes I get a bit worried because I get so overwhelmed w that shitty feeling, it almost seems to tell me to kill myself and get it over w at times even though I know that won't solve anything. I want to live. I want to be happy. I'm sick of being let down by the shitty human condition - story of my life...and I'm tired of this broken heart...

On a good note Kristina opened up a tiny bit and said - I miss you and I hate it...lol Typical for her and me. It;'s crazy I love her the way I do and I know it is part of what is making me miserable right now. Someday this will all pay off I hope. Dear God - please let me write really good music that expresses how I feel inside so I can be rid of this shitty feeling, and have a successful band. She also asked me several times to call her tommorrow - short of begging..all while Nick was yelling at her about her shampoo being ont he floor lol. I said sorry to hear that - I can see why you stay..I really don't have much to offer but a good heart and a good man - and that doesn't count for shit these days =) She laughed and said I was funny - but I was fairly serious lol I wish she would come and make this all better. Best line in a song I heard tonight>? Escape Artists Never Die by Funeral For a Friend - Someone please help me - cause I'm dying here in front of you....preciseley the feelings I had tonight."

That said - we tracked Russ' gtrs last night for the 3 song promo sampler that is going to go to promoters,clubs,zines etc just to get our name out there. Eventually we'll prob. put a 2-3 song deal on the web or put it out and shortly thereafter put out the full length. Def. the biggest sounding cd I've ever had the pelasure of working on. Could it be AD Rock will get to his vocals next weekend? That'd be fuckin' dope. Yup I said it.

Girls suck. Not all of them but damn they can be some heartless creatures at times. Sometimes looks can be deceiving and even words - cause the most beautiful ones seem to hurt the most.  I'm not going to get involved w details but hopefully out there, there is a girl true to her word. Maybe I should act like an asshole - seems those jerk offs have no probs getting girls. Not like I have a prob. It's dealing w them that is rough lol. 

Real quick there is a girl in WI I have talked to for some time. In the past few yrs we have gotten as close as 2 people who live a 1000 miles apart can. She was really there for me and in a time where my ex fiancee had sucked every last bit of esteem away, she made me feel I was worth something. Fast fwd to her moving in w some roomates and normal ""growing up"" bs, she ends up hooking w this dude and at my lowest point - failed me. I couldn't get a call back, and when we did talk there was all this distance. That annoys me - fake closeness. It like fucks w you - words are right but the feeling isn';tm know what I mean? Well I never really had closure on the issue and just buried it all. Low and behold last night Sara brings up his name and all this stuff about when she dated him. Naturally it brought up old feelings and she just had to know what was wrong - thus causing tension and a quick - Oh Ashley is home I better get going. Yea that was a blast. Talked to her today and said sorry if I upset you last night, I hadn't wanted to talk about it in the first place. She said it's ok but still there was annoyance in her voice. The most simple way I can put it is - imagine someone says they want to give you the world, and that you are this special being - words you've always wanted to hear your whole life - that you've strived hard as a human being to earn. Imagine that same person does something to contradict that. How likely would you be to believe anything ""real"" they had to offer? I can't stand being a jaded human being but my only solace is the music and my band create and my bond I have w my 4 brothers in this game of sacrifice and trials.

Hope that all comes through on our recording - and I hope all this is not in vain. I'm not even going to get started on Kristina. I must sound like the biggest scumbag talking to all these different girls, but it isn't like that. If I've learned anything - there isn't a person out there (minus fam.) that would sacrifice for you. Yes you have to be selfish to a point in the sense you can't make someone happy if you aren't happy, but wtf? The Human condition blows lol...

song: Never Met Another Gemini - why? Cause I am a Gemini and the one person I felt connected w on that level has cut off any sign of affection. Time will tell but I have doubts - at the risk of sounding homo - Miss Right where are you?"

But don't waste my time - this is no fun for me
Each day an eternity - time drags on
The end of days is coming - I can feel it in my bones...

Yea so the studio is going well. Things sound sick and I can;t wait for Russ to add his magic to the stuff and then ADRock to lay down his vox tracks...We'll probably end up putting out a 3 song smpler til we release the full length to buy us some time.

Headed to the studio now....Dani if I don't get to talk to you, I miss you already - yea it's one of those days but I did manage to throw a soda at someone during some troadrage interplay last night! Good stuff *sarcasm off*

Did I mention I was cooking lunch for Kristina today? In case I didn't - I did, hence the aforementioned title. Not like it was bad - but after the emo wake up call yesterday, I was a lil on guard - looking hard for a sign. Again mixed signals. For as many times as I've gone out w this girl, you'd think I had a clue...lol. I guess that is one of the cool things about her is she keeps me on my feet. She is amazing in alot of ways that all make my soul sincerely smile. Very few people do that to me or have given me that feeling - be it a friend, lover or family member...I got her to talk for the 2 min before she left and basically it was stuff I came to the conclusion of. She is in a relationship. She lives w the dude. She can't do anything to jeaopordize her situation for the sake of Sam and herself - to get laid along w some feelings (lol as she put it) She has a way w words huh>? She had me watch Bad Boys 2 today and man I was not wanting to, but somehow as dumb as this may sound, she actually made the movie better. We didnt get to finish our conv. but it's a start. Nothing about feelings mentioned other than me hugging her and asking if she still felt the same twds me. She said yes...so I guess right now my option is waiting. I said great another week of hanging...she said something about liking this - not in a malicious evil girl way, but the process I guess. Could it be homegirl grew up (along w me? Perish the fucking thought) and doesn't want to jump in bed w me right away? Could be good...

God I need to find a job instead of writing about this shit lol. I decided I'm going to try and get a job digging pools and busting my ass all summer to earn as much money as possible under the table. I don't care if I die out in the sun or come back full on black instead of the brown kid I am now - I need to do this. Get my own place, another vehicle, and a life! I'll be damed if I let that fat ex finance drive my life into the ground.

Life is a trip that is for sure. Hope this works out, but for some reason - it feels like when Adam (formerly of Absolve) first started jamming w us. I wanted to believe in it so bad, and everything was awesome when we jammed, but when we didn't, and even to this day when we don't jam - it feels like everything takes forever. I just kept my guard up and everything turned out all right. Since Adam has joined the band, and things w Farewell Radiance have come together - everything is starting to come together in my life. I hope it's the same w Kristina, but then that leaves another lil messy (couple things) situation for me...to be explained later...rawk the fuck on -

"event","Yizzie - One day ends and another starts. A bit of an eye opener today. You know what I fig'd out? No matter how many I love you's, no matter if I hear the what I love about you's, or any of that shit - as long as she is w Nick, I am still - the other guy. A Cut out. A stand in. a stunt cock lol. Such is life. Maybe someday it will work out, but for now I am numbing myself and not cutting my options off. I have no committment - so I should just be happy and free.

On a side note I wish my fucking recording was done but to speed it up, we're releasing a demo first and shopping it. This way we can work on the full length which is about 1/2 way done at our own pace. www.FarewellRadiance.com

P.S. Dani - your boobies thank you for the TLC!"

 XTheGuitarChickx [08:27 PM]:  So one of my closest friends, Elaine, decided that she doesn't know what she believes in, if she believes in anythign at all.  So she's leaving my church and not going to be back for XXX amount of months/years.

 Xo EEY0RE oX [08:28 PM]:  o_o; and?

 Xo EEY0RE oX [08:28 PM]:  does that mean you can't contact her anymore? if so, then ::hug::

 XTheGuitarChickx [08:30 PM]:  She told that to my youth leader, who told my father, who blames me for her leaving.

 Xo EEY0RE oX [08:30 PM]:  x__x;

 XTheGuitarChickx [08:30 PM]:  Like it's my fault like I haven't been strong enough in faith...
 
Xo EEY0RE oX [08:31 PM]:  I have zip faith... v_V;

 XTheGuitarChickx [08:31 PM]:  And D has been just outright pissed at me for being alive,

XTheGuitarChickx [08:31 PM]:  Because I wouldn't let him read my personal stuff.
 
XTheGuitarChickx [08:32 PM]:  Because I wanted to go to a concert

 XTheGuitarChickx [08:32 PM]:  Because I don't want to go to a basketball game with him.

 XTheGuitarChickx [08:32 PM]:  Because I'm starting a band.

 XTheGuitarChickx [08:35 PM]:  D is an ass.  He's not even trying to father me at all.

 XTheGuitarChickx [08:35 PM]:  He only wants to try when it's convient for him.
 
XTheGuitarChickx [08:35 PM]:  I swear, 5 years from now I'm going to CA the moment I graduate.

 XTheGuitarChickx [08:37 PM]:  Why are they like that, anyway.  He blames Elaine's little crisis on me and her parents.  He wouldn't blame himself if I did somthing like that he'd blame her.

 XTheGuitarChickx [08:42 PM]:  D sucks.  Half the time I feel like screaming at him, ""WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT FROM ME?"""

"event","Elaine. Is. Gone.  She said that she won't be around for a long time, she's goign to ""try other churches and religions.""  She said she would keep in touch and visit me on my sites and such... but... I'll miss her.  I still have her AFI ""Sing the Sorrow"" CD, so whenever I listen to that I'll get more depressed than I already get... and the poster she gave me... I mean, as long as she calls me and lets me know she's alive.

This is harder for me because she was there for me and I was there for her when we were both goign through all our sh*t... And, I mean, I can't help but blame myself.  I have some kind of mental defect where I blame myself for all this kind of stuff.  


I have to go to a TAB meeting... so I'll write later..."

"event","Okay, so I jumped on the LJ bandwagon.  


Okay, if you go on my dA account, if you look in the gallery, I did a picture of Chester Bennington.  Unfortunately, the demon art teacher stole it from me.  It's now hanging in the office of my school, aka Sucksburg.  

I am going to sneak in and steal it back, I swear... ::whimper:: It took me a week to do that picture,I want it baaaaaaaaaaaaack... She didn't even ASK me if I wanted it to be displayed in the school.  I didn't, because it was a bit of a personal picture, since the quotes along the side were quotes that were very relevant to me...

You know what?  I'm going to shut up about the damn picture.  



Anyway, Jess F.'s band that I'm in: 
""Not until spring.  It's too friggin cold in my garage right now.""

So I'm a loser in a garage band.  Go me."

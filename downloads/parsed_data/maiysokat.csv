"event","Forgive me for this little ramble, which may or may not mean anything to me or anyone else a few hours from now:

Life is full of happiness we don't recognize.&nbsp; We're locked away in our cubicles and towns, our air conditioning, our cars, our daily routines.&nbsp; It is so important to break out and see the world as the alien, uncharted place it really is.&nbsp; It's easy to become bored with reality, because we perceive reality as a collection of facts.&nbsp; 3.97 per gallon, behaving properly at work, typing 75 words per minute, right turn at the light, a paycheck every two weeks, that book you borrowed and didn't read yet, what's for dinner, when to sleep.&nbsp; Every now and then, something random and obscure will set off my trapped imagination and bring it to something...else.

I am driving home in the rain, windows down.&nbsp; Cold, fresh air in August, and the speed of an empty freeway.&nbsp; The sky is a contradiction of shadow and sunlight, and the oncoming sunset paints the dotted line a pink-orange color between the shining pitch of the wet highway.&nbsp; A song is playing on the radio, and its lyrics are shaped in my mind to mean whatever makes the most sense to my imagination at the time.&nbsp; If I look up the words later, they will almost certainly be about something else.&nbsp; A feeling that is both disorientation and familiarity washes over me, like I've seen the world this way before and forgotten.&nbsp; I want badly to remember why, but there's an odd suspicion that the nostalgia for something unknown is part of the feeling as well, and its origin never existed in the first place.&nbsp; If it was my reality once, it was in childhood.&nbsp; I find my thoughts springing into third person, seeing myself discover the world in a new way and try to hold onto it, watching myself revel in the feeling, scramble for a description, plan to write it down if I find one.&nbsp; I watch myself become determined to capture something ungraspable. Even if the feeling is gone by the time I turn onto my street, I must remember the words, they might trigger something later.&nbsp; Some words that can call back this feeling whenever I want it.&nbsp; I am thinking in second person again, I am me again, I am me trying to remember the words I decided to use to remember the feeling I'm now losing.&nbsp; But the words are just what the feeling meant to me moments before...nostalgia, loss, discovery, magic, joy.&nbsp; By the time I reach my keyboard, the words are only words.&nbsp; And when I look them up, the lyrics of that song mean something different.&nbsp; Nothing remains to prove that for a few minutes in my car today, the world became something new and exciting.&nbsp; But I know that as long as that feeling can still find me, I will still have that other me inside, watching me in third person.&nbsp; If I had to name the feeling, I would name it as my true self, reminding me that I can be more."

9AM - In case of delays, let's assume I won't get the truck back to my apt in Voorhees till 9.&nbsp; Then we can throw ze stuff in the back!
11:30 or 12ish - We have pizza picnic and root beer floats in my empty living room!

"event","Just thought I'd update on stuffs.  I've been thinking a lot about what really makes me who I am.  In turn, hypothetically, I also think about what would make me the person I want to be.  For someone who often thinks of work as ""something that's necessary in order to afford the various things needed to be the person I want to be"", I certainly seem to shift my entire self-image when I'm unemployed.  Work seems to be a very important part of how I define myself.  Right now, I have no idea what I want to do with my career.  I really haven't the foggiest.  What does that say about who I am, then, if it's so important to my identity and I can't think of a way to find it?  My whole life feels like it's in limbo, even though it should just be about finding work.  I'm waiting on an answer from a company that stands to offer me a potential path.  I'm not 100% sure it's the path ""I"" want, but it's more than I've been able to envision elsewhere, and better than the dead ends I've chosen so far.  The problem is the waiting.  I've decided to at least make an effort to keep looking while I wait, but it's hard to move with the weight of that decision hanging over my head."

Nothing feels stable in my life and I'm too overwhelmed to decide how to start fixing it.  I miss feeling important and needed.  I just have to start over, but it's so fucking hard.  I need a new job, new priorities, new friends, and new hobbies/social groups.  And most importantly, a stronger self image.

But what I totally was not prepared for was that I feel stranded and bored here, and homesick for my new place.  I really can't wait to leave.  I can't bring myself to write or read or start any projects (and I have quite a lot of those).  My parents are just like always, except that they're acting like slightly clingy friends. Friends that think you're sad about something and need to be comforted/brought out for ice cream and social life when what you really want is to be alone and do.....well, nothing.  I wish I could make something more of my rare day off, but at this rate I'm not enjoying it or getting anything done.  Really, really bewildering.  Do other people experience this when they move out?

Or maybe it's just the unstructured time thing.

"event","This is the first time (really!) I have ever actually done one of these, but at the moment it trumps my endless and futile job hunt, so what the hay.

Tired of all of those surveys made up by high school kids?
'Have you ever kissed someone?'
'Missed someone?'
'Told someone you loved them?'
'Drank alcohol?'
Here are some questions for the people who are a little more mature...
Okay, okay... OLD FOLKS like us......


1. What bill do you hate paying the most?
My car insurance, but i got it paid off in advance for the year, so now I'm happy.

2. Where was the last place you had a romantic dinner?
A pirate ship!

3. Last time you puked from drinking?
I puked from drinking too much water once because I was afraid of getting drunk....I think it was 5 years ago.

4. When is the last time you got drunk and danced on a bar?
Aw, I've never been drunk, which is fine, but I'm sorta sad I never danced on a bar...

5. Name one of your first grade teachers?
Mrs. McDonald

6. What do you really want to be doing right now?
I want to have a job, which means I should want to apply to jobs, but for some reason that is the last thing I want to do. *confused*

7. What did you want to be when you were growing up?
Captain planet....

8. How many colleges did you attend?
One

9. Why did you wear the shirt that you have on right now?
I'm too lazy to get out of my pajamas.  Maybe if you give me a job, I'll agree to bathe.

10. GAS PRICES?
Bleh.  

11. If you could move anywhere?
If I could have my favorite people with me, I'd move to Suzhou, because it's the most beautiful place in the world.  But nah, honest to God, I love New Jersey.

12. First thought when the alarm went off this morning?
Why did my mother wake me up?  I could be just now waking up....

13. Last thought before going to sleep last night?
I was thinking about XXX.          What??

14. Favorite style of underwear?
For meee?  Or for notmeeee?  As long as it doesn't ride up...

15. Favorite style of underwear for the opposite sex?
Shiny gold thong.  

16. What errand/chore do you despise?
I hate food shopping.  It's too cold.  

17. If you didn't have to work, would you volunteer at an art gallery?
It would have to be significantly different from my current preconception of art gallery culture and the kind of art that gets appreciated in a gallery.  An anime con/ artist alley type thing?  Definitely!

18. Get up early or sleep in?
I get depressed when I sleep in, but I do it a lot.

19. What is your favorite cartoon character(s)?
Vashu za Sutanpiido!  Captain planet? *^_^*

20. Favorite NON sexual thing to do at night with a girl/guy?
Thunderst-....wait...mm, lying around just talking.

21. A secret that you wouldn't mind everyone knowing?
That's an oxymoronic question.  If I didn't mind everyone knowing,...ok.  My first crush....was on ""Mork"" (Robin Williams, Mork & Mindy) when I was about 8.  Nannu Nannu!

22. When did you first start feeling old?
Not Yet!

23. Favorite 80's movie?
Short Circuit!

24. Your favorite lunch meat?
I like salami, ham, and capicola together with provologne, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, hot peppers, oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and oregano.  

25. What do you get every time you go into Sam's Club?
At Costco they have these big things of chocolate covered raisins....yay!  I used to get lisa frank stickers in enormous batches.

26. Beach or lake?
Definitely lake, like Adirondack lake.

27. Do you think marriage is an outdated ritual that was invented?
I think it's a beautiful idea, but our society's on the whole not prepared for it.  It shouldn't be a given that people get married to raise families.  Only in cases where they feel especially and absolutely sure should they get married.  Nowadays people divorce too easily, and it makes the whole institution of marriage look corrupt.  I also think the moral imperative against premarital sex encourages irresponsible marriages by people too young to know what they want yet.

28. How many people do you stalk on Myspace?
I have a profile, but I usually log in to see if new people are stalking me so I'm not rude to my friends who made profiles.

29. Favorite guilty pleasure?
Wow.  Um...yup.

30. Favorite movie you wouldn't want anyone to find out about?
Haha!  I have a box of old bootleg VHS anime porn in my basement that I've never managed to watch.  Don't ask how it got there.  I'm sure it's pretty bad though.

31. What's your drink?
Mudslide!

32. Cowboys or Indians?
Indians.

33. Cops or Robbers?
Poo to them all.

34. Who from high school would you like to run into?
My band teacher Mr. Knier.

35. What radio station is your car radio tuned to right now?
G-rock.

36. Norm or Cliff?
Mayday, mayday! Inside joke lost! Repeat, inside joke lost!
 
37. The Cosby Show or the Simpsons?
I never fell for either show.

38. Worst relationship mistake that you wish you could take back?
Compromising so much of myself that I no longer knew who I was without him.  Lucky for me, I eventually figured it out and know not to do it again.

39. Do you like the person who sits directly across from you at work?
I liked her, but she was so negative that it had a peripheral affect on me.

40. If you could get away with it, who would you kill?
I don't think I hate anyone enough to do that.  I think murder is wrong, though there have been times when it's seemed to me like the only way to salvage our world.

41. What famous person(s) would you like to have dinner with?
BoA (Korean/Japanese pop star) or L'arc en Ciel.

42. What famous person would you like to sleep with?
Urk...I see celebrities like I see cartoon characters.  I can picture it, but it's not within the realm of viable reality. Of course, some of them are attractive, but I'm sure none of them would make me happy that way.

43. Have you ever had to use a fire extinguisher for its intended purpose?
Nope.

44. Last book you read for real?
A book about Office Ladies in Japan.

45. Do you have a teddy bear?
It's a tiger.  My sis gave it to me when I broke my tooth in first grade to cheer me up.

46. Strangest place you have ever brushed your teeth?
O_O.  I guess in the middle of the woods when I was camping...that's fairly strange.  I had to be nowhere near my campsite so I wouldn't attract bears.

47. Somewhere in California you've never been and would like to go?
The coastal forests.

48. Number of texts in a day?
Two or three.

49. At this point in your life would you rather start a new career or a new relationship?
Career!

50. Do you go to church?
Not as often as I'd like. When I move hopefully I'll be able to find a community in south jersey. 

51. Pencil or pen?
Mech. Pencil or uniball.  Always in print.

52. What do you want to achieve in life?
More than I can possibly accomplish.

54. Where do you see yourself when you are 40 ?
I will live in a castle with a chinese courtyard in the center with a pond and waterfalls and bridges with a pagoda in the middle and rhodedendrons and rocks!  And all my friends will live in the castle or in close proximity and I'll be a rich and famous author of fantasy/romance stories and have the means and energy to help anyone who needs me.  I'll be fluent in Japanese and Chinese and photoshop and flash and people will ask me to sign things when they pass me in the street.  Is that too modest?"

"event","Today's my first day of unemployment after finishing at MU on Friday, and what do I learn but they want me back already (this will be the second time they fired and rehired me).  I told them I can only do it as part time or 3 days a week because I need to focus on my job search, so we'll see what they say.  Otherwise I've just been trying to keep myself busy today and not get overwhelmed by all the stuff I have to do.  I wrote thank you notes and went to the post office, bought food to make for dinner and things, trying to do laundry, and applying to jobs.  There's so much I want to do!  I'm trying to take it one thing at a time.  I'm making shishkabobs later because I've been craving them ever since Fletch cooked them for us.

In other news; Sewing a corset.  One word: ""Whaaaaaaaaaaah?""

I have discovered the coolest dessert ever!!!  MOCHI!!!

Edit:

Okay, so MU really does want me back, and suddenly I feel a little overwhelmed.  I don't want to work there anymore, I burned my bridges for the second time and they want me to go back.  I want to do so many other things.  They say at least end of June...for three weeks at 3 days a week that's only 600 bucks in exchange for the stress of managing work around my apartment viewing and job searching needs.  On the other hand, it could take a month or two for me to find a position I like...but I'm definitely feeling squished.  I sort of want to back out.  Managing interviews around a job is so complicated.  I guess I could change my mind, though it doesn't look very good."

"event","So!  I picked up the new Linkin Park CD with Tim last weekend (WOOT!), and I've been listening to it all week trying to decide what I think of it.  It's my favorite band, and I had no idea what to expect from the new album.  The one song that's been aired on the radio, ""What I've Done"", struck me when I first heard it as a touch mainstream, just a tiny hint of unoriginal, but still intriguing.  Like a guitar hero version of Linkin Park - I knew it was their style, but it was hard to decide if it was actually that group singing and not some copycat group.

Anyway, here is what I've concluded.
- The album is much softer than their previous work, with more heartfelt songs than angry screaming songs.  One of my favorite things about the band is the way the lead singer throws SO much emotion into his voice, and transforms between metal screaming and a crystal clear vibrato and various degrees of in between to assert the emotions behind the lyrics.  This album definitely keeps that going, which I love.

- The songs are surprisingly political.  Two songs are almost unmistakably in reference to President Bush and Iraq.  I wasn't expecting that, but I'm pleased because it asserts the maturity of the group.  The reverse side of that is that that's really sort of necessary, because...

- The content of the other songs is overblown and not particularly striking.  Despite containing what's probably the most hopeful song the band's ever done (""What I've Done""), the emo thing gets out of hand, with several songs focusing heartily on death and self loathing.  This isn't a new theme for the band, but this time most of it just didn't strike a chord with me.  Many of the songs are enjoyable musically and for the singing, but don't really hit home.  But!

- Some do.  The third track on the disk, ""Leave out all the Rest"", really gets me every time I hear it.  It's emo in the delicious way, not the ew drama way.  It's also fairly positive while still being about death, sort of focusing on the desire to be remembered lovingly by those around us despite our possible failings.    

- The album tries a lot of new things.  Besides experimenting with softer, more ballad-like songs, they also included a song that has to be the angriest and most disturbing I've ever heard from them.  As the first track, no less.  Lots of screaming in that one, including what I think is the longest sustained scream I've ever heard in a song.  Another song has almost a stomp-and-clap party-on feel, except it sounds suspiciously suicidal, which brings bad images of a huge mob of suicidal fans reveling in the unity of their self-hatred (please never watch ""Suicide Club"").  They also surprised me by letting different band members sing.  Several songs include two and three part harmony, and one is sung entirely by a non-lead singer.  Heck, even the rapper sings.  Instrumentally, they've always been into fusion, but they still surprise me sometimes.  One song features both a snare drum and a pipe organ, plus rap.  And works.  Who'da thought.  While we're on instruments, there's a nifty drum solo in the last track. 

All in all though, the album is very interesting and great music, but it doesn't have nearly as much power as Meteora did.  That was seriously the most satisfying album I've ever purchased, and I'm still not sick of a single song after a year and a half.  But if you have any interest in the band, I really recommend getting your hands on it.

Ok, sorry for babbling about Linkin Park for so long.  I'm sure there are folks out there who would like to shoot the radio when they play, but that's true for every band.  I promise I don't do this every time I get an album.  Heck, I don't buy music.  But they're my favorite band, so I am a little...how to put it...zealous?  *grin*"

"event","I have a couple projects going on right now.  I'm going to an anime con with Tim and my friends in July, and we're getting started on the team project of making at least 6 costumes.  That's exciting - I love making costumes.  

The other main thing is redeveloping the website for our roleplaying forum ""Heirot"".  The trick to this is that we need to move the forum to a new webspace without gaining access to its old source files.  This should be easy; create a backup of old forum and import it to the new database.  Unfortunately, after spending 6 hours straight following various methods and experiments, nothing I've done has been able to bring our old threads and member information over to the new server.  This is a big problem as our old webmaster is being highly uncooperative in giving us access to the files.  

After all that work, I feel tense because there's no satisfaction, no small success I can look at and feel I've made headway on the situation.  And now everything feels tedious.  Work is horribly boring and I want to be fixing the website instead, but I know I'd just waste more time.  It's safe to say I've tried everything I can do with my own knowledge base.  Still, it's eating at me that it's not working.  I'm obsessive about it now.  I'm bad at letting things sit.  

In other news, I'm not going to Japan after all.  My aunt is dying and my cousin needs my help to get through it.  And unfortunately for my vicarious dreamer side, living away from the people I care about isn't so cool after all.  It's not worth going if I'm not going to enjoy it.  That means job seeking time, which brings up the question of where I want to live.  Making the drive to Tim a bit shorter would be nice, but I also want to stay in range of my own friends.  Maybe New Brunswick.  I want a job and moving outness.  My parents both treated me badly last night when I mentioned I'd like to get the stuff off the table in our basement so we can use the room for sewing.  It gets a little crazy down there before the con each year, but jeez, they keep it messy too and they certainly don't use the basement.  Yet they feel the need to act like I'm trashing the house when I go to make USE of our space where nobody goes anyway.  

Arg I'm not sure how to get through work today, I can't sit still.  I'd like some small victory or accomplishment to yank up my morale a bit.  *spins in chair*"

"event","I've been in Baltimore, MD all week to be with my dad and help him recover from a prostatectomy.  But since Dad's spent most of his time dozing or unconscious, it's really amounted to my being with my Mother for 24 hour ""quality"" time.  I like to say I'm more like my Dad, but actually I'm equally like both my parents.  Unfortunately, a lot of the personality traits I got from my mom are the type that make us incompatible.  I very much need my own space (a point on which I can sincerely empathize with Selayna).  I'm in one hotel room with both parents, and they're catering to just about every nerve button I have.  Don't get me wrong, some bonding has taken place, but Dad's not the only one who'll need a recovery period when he gets home.  

I just finished the third book in Laurell K Hamilton's Anita Blake series.  I have to confess, I'm hooked.  If anyone is familiar with these books, I also have to confess that I totally want the heroine to end up with the master vampire, and I'm a bit sad because I'm fairly positive, based on a stolen glance at a later book's description, that he does not remain a love interest.  This probably means that he dies, and there's a good chance Blake's the one who kills him.  I'm holding out hope; it's been a long time since I could get hooked on a series of novels like this, even if I was originally pointed to Hamilton for her sex appeal.  

I get to go home tomorrow; can't wait for reprieve."

"event","Yes indeed, I have spent several hours today and yesterday raking me some bushes.  And raking the grass.  Raking leaves off the grass, you ask?  No...I'm pretty sure I was just regular old rakin' grass.  Ah, the joy of suburbia.  Dad's having his surgery on monday, so he's going nuts trying to prepare the lawn for the trauma of being without his constant affection (my father and my lawn are like this).  

I'm unemployed this week, so I've been praying for the muse to find me so I could use the time for writing.  Aside from some really neat ideas with no steam to start them, I haven't gotten to that yet.  Although I did get in an arting mood today and drew some of my friends crossed with cats.  My friend Andrew is a leopard and Cat wanted to be a lynx.  I intended to color them, but it looks like they will go into my vast pile of ""I will photoshop this some day"" for now.  The line arts are here http://www.maiysokat.com/Andrewcat%20copy.jpg and here http://www.maiysokat.com/Catcat%20copy.jpg .  Why is male physique SO much harder to draw than female?  Anyway this was the most fun I've had drawing in a while, so I'm happy!  If Tim's not careful (or perhaps regardless of his care) he might be next *cackle*  I wonder what kind of cat he is...muahahahaaha

Oh, one more thing!  If anyone can help me figure out what's wrong with the torso on the male catperson, I'd be grateful for the insight.  I can feel something's off, but I don't know what to fix."

"event","Okay, maybe not gleefully.  But since completing my temporary assignment at Monmouth University last Thursday, I've been doing much, much better than I thought I'd be.  I expected depression, loneliness and a sense of not having a direction.  Sure, I have some amount of direction - I'm going to Japan for ten weeks in the fall, and assumably temping where possible up to that date.  But it's more the sense of losing people.  I'd been feeling cut off from my friends, and for someone who gets attached to people very quickly, leaving my coworkers after four months was very sad. 

But then like magic, my best friend since I was 7 who I've barely seen for four years called me up and wanted to hang out the night I left my job.  Pat, my closest coworker, called me to see how I was doing, and seems like we'll be keeping well in touch.  Kathy, my amazing manager, brought in bagels and pie for my last day (I was nearly moved to tears...I love bagels :P).  And my sis came home early for spring break!  Plus I got to spend Friday night and most of Saturday with Tim, who's amazing.  And then today I went to the mall with several friends I haven't seen in a while.  It just seems like too much to be a coincidence.  It was enough to make me get up and go to church this morning on 5 hours' sleep; someone deserves my gratitude for these and all the other blessings in my life.  

I'm going to make the most of this week, since I may not have another assignment for a bit.  Not sure what I'll get done, but hitting the gym is high on my list, as well as taking care of my friends.  It's exciting, really.  Free time always either excites me or throws me into lethargic slumps.  Hopefully I'll stay motivated.

A random link my childhood friend showed me: this is a parody of the SNL skit ""Dick in a box"", done by some people she knows at U Penn.  The fact that she knows the girl makes it funnier.  It's catchy though!  I got it stuck in my head!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xElIik0Ys0"

"event","For some reason I have once again decided to undertake an entirely unnecessary project that involves learning lots of things that are way beyond my current skill set.  So this time, I want to make a website in flash.  I'd like to say it's nothing fancy, but the moment the word 'flash' pops into my head, intricate fantasies of animated material and interactivity swim through my head.  I'm currently studying the ""Flash 5 Bible"" cause it's what I could find in our closet - a book which is about 8 million pages long and minimally illustrated.  Meanwhile, I do not actually own the program.  So I am creating this mental simulation of the entire interface in my head while I formulate a way to acquire it without actually parting with any money, which will probably result in something illegal.  I'm all revved up about it though, so I'm happy.  This whole week has been awesome, maybe cause Monday was off.  Glee!"

"event","Gasp!  A journal!  Yay!  What should I put in it?? My sister's going to college again tomorrow.  She's awesome!  I'll miss her.  She's taking DDR with her, too (curses!!).  I have no plans for tomorrow so I may try to get my room clean - like really clean.  My life never seems to be actually in order, though I'm usually having too much fun crashing through it to worry about it for long.  But it feels so amazing when things are neat and clean and I'm on top of stuff.  Maybe once a year I throw all my shit out of my drawers and closet onto the floor, and pick through it, sort it, throw half of it out, and then re-store it and vacuum.  That is nice.  On the other hand, maybe I will abandon the mess and go spend time with Tim, who is addictive like that.  He's the best because he brings me chicken wings, and not just because I like chicken wings.  It's cause he BRINGS me chicken wings...er...well it's complicated lol, but it basically amounts to me being swept off my feet and perfectly happy to be free of gravity.  

So!  Time to play 'things that are neat and things that are less neat'!  French toast is neat.  Laundry is neat when you take it out of the dryer and glomp it.  Live Journal is still a mystery to me, but it seems neat also.  The end!  No, I'm not omitting less neat things.  It's my game, shut up.

Ok, time to be philosophical for a minute.  Nothing too heavy.  I was told to start a journal here, but it's a little hard.  I mean, part of the thrill of a journal is writing about feelings and experiences you can't really tell anyone but yourself, but which are so powerful that they need to be expressed somehow.  Unless you're not terribly prudent, the enterprise of a public journal requires stripping it of that spiritual level, since we can never be completely honest about ourselves publicly.  It's not because we're deceptive, but because compromise and tact are necessary to healthy relationships, and sometimes feelings, no matter how potent, shouldn't necessarily be expressed to other people.  It can be worrying and confusing, and sometimes downright irresponsible.  But that doesn't mean it's a bad idea to have a public journal; it's just a different kind of craft.  Actually, it's one that's a lot more fun, because it gives an excuse to focus on the positive things and to strive to express yourself, and yes, it's just a little vain, and that's okay.  

So, this will be fun; not something I'll play with every day, but a neat project to keep up with when I have time and something worth saying, even though I don't presume anyone should be waiting on the edge of their seat (yeah yeah, pronoun-verb agreement, whatever, it SOUNDS better that way!!!  This is a casual medium!) to read my brief rambles of hyperness and random amateur philosophy.

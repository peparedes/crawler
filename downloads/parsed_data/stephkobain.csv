"event","so ive been sober for like a month, and last weekend i spent it high off my ass, and it felt soo good to be high, to escape reality, and just forget about all the bullshit, i came home on saturday, and sat on the floor in my room and just laughed at myself, cuz i care too much about things, and i'm just so damn stupid for caring about the little things as much as i do, thats the problem with people and all of their components, they care too much about things that are too trivial to debate on a serious level... so now i'm back to being a freak that does weird things and doesnt care about what people think of me, and i must admit, thats when i am the  happiest, freedom of will should not be comprimised, no matter how good the sex is... i dont like my clothes anymore, i want to be my dirty grungy self again, i think ill have to pull my prison shirt out of the bottom of my drawer and put it on, and wear it for the next 5 days, and see how much people like me then.. and then i'll stop talking to people all together and become a recluse, a depressed, ADHD suffering little freak crackhead on the road to being a junkie... lol, little kurt kobain wannabe is me, whatdya think, i changed in the last few months???? nah nah nah... im just a pseud(god i hope thats the right word)... but yea, im a fake, and im a suicidal idiot, i was just trying on a new suit for a little bit and testing the waters, but its cold and icy, so fuck you all

copy and paste i have no more to say..im crying and i need to go to bed...the article is below.

A video located today on Sheik Abu Hamza's website, www.shareeah.org, features four children, doing what as children the world over do: pretending. 

But what is completely unnerving about this video is what they are pretending. 

One young boy kneels in front of three other children, in the same manner of the condemned man; Three other children stand behind him in the same way that the terrorists stood over the men prior to their beheading. The three standing children are armed with pretend weapons. One of the three children is a girl. 

The tallest of the three standing children pretends he is Zarqawi, and reads a list of demands. 

The film clip ends with the pretend beheading of the kneeling child. 

Chilling."

'666' Prefix Printed on Some Passes in Georgia

ROME, Ga. (March 1) - Tickets at one movie theater screening Mel Gibson's ''The Passion of the Christ'' are being deemed decidedly unholy.   
   
The number 666, which many Christians recognize as the ''mark of the beast,'' is appearing on movie tickets for Gibson's film at a Georgia theater, drawing complaints from some moviegoers.

The machine that prints tickets assigned the number 666 as a prefix on all the tickets for the film, said Gary Smith, owner of the Movies at Berry Square in northwest Georgia. The 666 begins a series of numbers that are listed below the name of the movie, the date, time and price.

''It's from our computer and it's absolutely a coincidence,'' Smith said. ''It has nothing to do with the film company or any vendor. It's completely in our computer.''

In the Bible, the book of Revelation says 666 is the ''number of the beast,'' usually interpreted as Satan or the Antichrist.

Several patrons have made comments about the numbers, and one person who was uncomfortable having 666 on her ticket asked for a pass to be substituted for a ticket.

''A lot of people have asked what the numbers mean, some said it seemed odd, some said it was inappropriate,'' said theater employee Erica Diaz.

The movie, which opened Wednesday, is a bloody depiction of Christ's final hours and crucifixion.

 Venusbluefairy [5:10 AM]:  it helps
someone: [5:11 AM]:  helps what?

And this concludes your review on American Calvary Films...people are so funny sometimes....needless to say this one deserves no more comtact....

to be this persons age and not know squat about what is going on in the world is pathetic....*200 miles in this day and age? i dont even know where i live now!*....wonder who dean once voted for? Nixon you say? haha maybe.....i have a journal only for this babble...Political babbla that is....texas tea....black gold....but i thought that this convo i had tonight deserved more than a glance over....to think that 9-11 or the recent war didnt touch a house in american makes me mad...makes me wonder whether this boi lives on his own at 19--if his friends didnt talk about it...what his teachers were thinking not bringing it up somehow...or his parents....maybe they were to busy eating sushi in vermont with Dean...le sigh le sigh....see im not all rebub.  used le  and thats french Damn it!

there is a ad ot now that compares Hitler to Bush..the end screen says ""A Nation Under Lies"" run by Dems.. if you wanna see the ad email me venusbluefairy@aol.com and ill mail you the link...i think its horrible..cause all is well Under the Hill and Over the Hill....and so comes snow after fires, and even dragons have their endings....i wish now only to be in my own armchair...*and she was off*"

2)TO GO OUT AND MAKE SOME FREAKING FRIENDS INTHIS NEW TOWN THAT I CALL HOME....ive been out 1 time in 6 months where it was a social thing...even though it was at a goth/metal club and those are the people im trying not to hook up with...I NEED TO LET A LITTLE LIGHT IN AND A LOT OF DARK OUT...i like the whole happy hippie thing...dancing and just being HAPPY gd it! 

3)TO STOP SMOKING (at first in front of XAN) BY JULY 7TH....i mean if i plan on getting in shape and healthy for a baby then i need to start now huh? seems to me that it makes alot od sence....CLEANSE THE BODY AND THE SOUL OF YOUR CHILD WILL BE HAPPY :) and i guess if im gonna do that i need to stop the DRINKING as well....OH!!! maybe drinking first and then smoking cause who can drink and not freaking smoke!!! yeah not me! *Smirk*

so there they are....i HAVE to do the first one...cause as much as i love the man i know a good relationship cant be built on simi-trust...and i need him in my life... :) ..."

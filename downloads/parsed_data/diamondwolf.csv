"event","I originally came up with this journal to have a 'private' outlet to vent about life without people I know finding out about it.  I didn't really do much with it.  

For the few out there who would see this, my three and a half year relationship is ending.  I guess ending is the best word for it, but I suspect that if I wasn't in denial, I would just say that it ended.

I am left being unable to trust my own instincts, which I used to trust implicitly.  I believed in this woman, believed in the relationship, and felt that if I was good and kind and loving that her problems would eventually go away and she would stop hurting me.  Well, she didn't.

They say that nice guys finish last.  I am finally beginning to believe it..  I don't have a lot to show for being selfless and giving.

I wonder if it is possible to give too much.  Maybe there is a line, you give some, and then wait to see if you get back some in kind, and then it is safe to give more.

It is supposed to get better.  It's gotten worse every day since we decided to breakup for good.

At least tonight's a good tv night."

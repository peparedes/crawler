As long as anyone has gazed onto this tiny square of the net (Roughly 0.0000001% of populace), I have been in all sorts of colorful moods, ranging from ""You're unique, just like everyone else"", ""Everyone seems normal until you get to know them"", and ""Never miss a good chance to shut up"".
Ah, those were the days.
This is just like graduating from school away from all those retards who bother you.
Here's a Zen-type thought I got from a very special person named ""Gundam Ryoko""... What was it.
""No one is listening, until you fart.""

The internet is like a drug. It should not be used all the time.
I still recomend Donnie Darko to be seen. Especially to two types of people.
1) People who bitch about movies that they think suck.
2) People who watch movies because they love 'em.

Those two reasons because they tend to bitch at eachother and cause me entertainment.

Ain't much here now. Guess you could say I have moved on. I am content with the old, and if anyone comes and trys to rattle my nerves...
I'll kick your bloody arse so hard you'll kiss the moon!

The problem is noone can see the expressions I make, or the emotion of the situation when typing on the cold-hearted cube.
Most people of the human consciousness, and I do mean, pretty much 85% of the people I've met in my life, both past and recent have no idea what the meaning of thier existance is.
Evil or good? Human concept... I am trying to see things you guys' way, but unfortunately, I can't get my head the far up my arse.

For Christ's sake... Grow the fuck up and quit acting like a bunch of 7th grade retards.
What I'm trying to say is, I belong everywhere, and have no home. Where-as most people have no emotion, and yet live in obscurity.

Well... That is what was on my mind today, and perhaps for the longest time, and with no significant other to share life with.
I shall now watch my family crumble away... And finally be alone, as it may be written in the stars.
I have no home, I exist everywhere. The alpha and the omega, without the religious stuff.

--------------

1. FURRY NAME: Most people call me ""Kit"". My other name/s are secret.
2. REAL NAME: Joseph McCloud
3. AGE & BIRTHDAY: 21, July 20th, 1981
4. LOCATION: Kenosha, WI
5. SPECIES: Grayish pale fox. It goes with mood, the color of my fur. Sometimes red, sometimes white, but predominant pale.
6. UNIQUITY (What makes you unique?): Unique... To sum up most of this question, listen to ""HIGH HOPES"" by ""PINK FLOYD"". You should get some idea of what I am talking about. I am indeed, the most unique person/furry I have ever known. I may not like the things I do at times, but it is a relationship that lifelong friends have, am I right? ...My problem is; I have so much on my mind. I need to tell someone. I wonder if anyone is that patient, or if they in fact do have want to listen. I am mostly adventuristic. I am not meant to be barred down by office work, or a job the goes no-where. A FREE-SPIRIT, born with fire in his blood was never meant to be locked away inside of a house. The open road and friends are a dream come true. And most of you agree with me, so you don't have to hide it. I am a pale fox in my mind; cold and contemplative, I am a thinker. It goes with my mood, as I have stated. I live out my charactor, so you can be sure that I am not acting at all when we meet. My dark exterior hides my true self, but there is none so far strong enough to crack it, in person. My tail is who I am. The fox is one of the most inteligent creatures you will ever know.

Occupations
--------------------

7. SCHOOL/WORK: Graduated in 1999. I am assistant curator for the local museum.
8. HOBBIES: Anime, hiking, walking, swimming, reading, writing, movies, video games,  Japanese culture (writing and language included), sleep, friends, thinking, and art. My info section lists the rest.
9: WHAT FURRY RESOURCES DO YOU USE?: I am not mainstream... If I was, that leaves me open to back-biting closed minds. My friends are my true family.
10. WHAT DO YOU USE TO CHAT WITH OTHER FURRIES?: AIM. I also respond to replys in this livejournal. 
11: ICQ#? AOL SN? MSN? Yahoo? LiveJournal? This is a redundant question, and I prefer to poke fun at it than typing in a simple, short answer.

Random Questions
------------------------------

12: WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN YOU WAKE UP? I am mistaken. I assumed that I lived in reality. I normally try to keep the light from burning my retina's.
13: WHAT'S THE LAST THING YOU DO BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP? I listen to MY music. If it was your music, then I would not have my individuality, like most of the robots in the military.
14: WHAT'S YOUR LEAST FAVORITE FOOD? Mayonaise........ *Shudders.* Do not get me started.
15: IF YOU CAN GO BACK IN TIME, WHERE WOULD YOU GO AND WHY? Going back in time will not be easy. I intend to become a PROPHET to myself, like the great Magus once was.
16: WHAT'S THE FURTHEST PLACE YOU VISITED FROM YOUR PRESENT LOCATION? Okinawa, Japan. Lived for three years, better memories there than here.
17. WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE NATIONALITY FOR FOOD? Japanese, Irish, Scottish... My list goes on.
18. NAME ONE PERSON YOU KNOW WHO'S 24 YEARS OLD. No-one you know... Not anyone's business unless they really want to know.
19. HOW MUCH MONEY IS IN YOUR WALLET RIGHT NOW? No wallet. I keep my only wallet in my relics box. It was gained in the summer of 1992, before I moved to Hell... I mean Wisconsin. My money ammount is my concern, not anyone elses. Unless it was an emergency.
20. HOW/WHEN DID YOU DISCOVER FURRY: I don't remember... I have always been an anthromorphic person. It started with one of my favorite DISNEY cartoons, ""Robin Hood"". Hence the fox... I could bore you forever, with my thoughts, but I tend to go from subject to subject.
21. SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE PERSON YOU YANKED THIS FROM: I met a new, possible friend... His name will be kept safe, locked in the vault of my mind for safety."

I am feeling great! You see this smile? Do you see this smile!?
...Okay, smiling time is over. I just might have to smack myself with a frying pan.
First of all, I am not showing up too frequently for reasons of the distractive, and of the creative.
=D
I am a good example of keeping in touch with my past. It is not as dark as it could be. But I've had moments of pure hell.
...
I have no idea how far back my family tree goes, nor do I know who I am related to in history. But, I can happily smile at the thought that I have no reletives related to General Custer... 
My thoughts are escaping too quick to be jotted down.
So I end this on a happy note. I always say I am an old soul; I know that it must be true for reasons I am not about to divulge into until a later date. 
I must end this for now. Thanks to all for reading this old souls journal. You will be rewarded with my thanks.


Sun is shinin' in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin' everybody's in a play
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day hey,hey

Runnin' down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly in the city
On the streets where once was pity
Mister blue sky is living here today hey, hey

Mister blue sky please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long
Where did we go wrong?

Hey you with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race
A celebration, mister blue sky's up there waitin'
And today is the day we've waited for

Hey there mister blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Ev'rybody smiles at you

Mister blue sky, mister blue sky
Mister blue sky

Mister blue, you did it right
But soon comes mister night creepin' over
Now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind I'll remember you this
I'll remember you this way

Mister blue sky please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long
Where did we go wrong?

"event","I have lucid dreams almost every night. I envy my otherworldly counterpart.
In my dream last night I saw a girl who looked familiar. She was in her group of friends, but I did not care, for I walked right up to her and began to talk. These kinds of things don't go smoothly in reality.
I saw her house. I only saw her parents briefly. The house was not in the best of shape. A moster was after her... A shadowy creature that was featureless to describe. The girl seemed to feel safe with me...
If that happened in reality, then dreams would have no boundaries.
Things like that are rare in this world... I want to do something like that, if it gave me a chance to find what I'm looking for.

My grandfather used to tape movies for us kids... But I have noone who shares my sympathy. My memories will never go away, they always come back to remind me of how I want to be. I have an affinity for disney. Maybe because it is my true self in reality. Am I really as crazy as a Loony Toons charactor, or is that the facade? Maybe I am as deep as a Disney charactor, and noone wants to dig. Or maybe I am a mix of both. It would be stupid to jump to conclusions without further research. 
Or maybe I am a Don Bluth... A movie that mimics reality and merges both the deepness of Disney with ultra high levels of novel fantasy.

You make friends by talking it seems. What are the odds the person you can see being a friend will actually agree with you firstoff? Will they eventually tell you that they are your friend? I wish I could see into the minds of people I meet. That would make it easy to decide.

I am still not feeling well. Screw the person who invented the phrase ""You have no right to complain""... Chances are that moron is already dead, but when I die, me and him are going to have a few words...


Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder feelin' kinda older I tripped the
merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing the calliope crashed to the ground
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot snappin' his fingers clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-menot whispers daddy's within earshot save the buckshot turn up the band
And she was blinded by the light. Cut loose like a deuce
Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright

Some brimstone baritone anticyclone rolling stone preacher from the east
He says: Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance

Yeah he was blinded by the light. Cut loose like a deuce
Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light
He got down but she never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight

Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes
She said I'll turn you on sonny to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
And go-cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
And little Early-Pearly came in by her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer playin' backyard bombardier
Yes and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent a dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well I jumped up, spit in the air, fell on the ground, asked wich was the way back home
He said take a right at the light, keep going straight until right, and then boy you're on your own

And now in Zanzibar a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complaining that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but he'd figured he'd be all right

He was just blinded by the light. Cut loose like a deuce
Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light
Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun
Oh but mama that's where the fun is

I think Tremaine is catching the rythm of my ways... He knows me to be quiet, and that he may also know of the depression.
Only inquisitive people will want to know me. So far I don't know any.
Inquisitive by means of having to ask me yourselves instead of me complaining all the time.

I can't write everything I want to here from the past several days...
But today I did something different. I went outside in the cold, and released some of my pent up rage by raking leaves, and hacking away at the bush that blocks part of the parking space in our backyard. Also helped my sister carve her pumpkin, in the cold. My hands were dirty enough anyway. Not much happened between then and now.

My E-mail is fucked up... It doesn't matter. What's in a name. The bastard will get his/hers soon.

About half an hour ago to an hour my nose bled like mad. Minor headache. It continued to bleed before I got an evil idea for its use. In my left hand I let my blood drip until there was enough to coat both lenses of my glasses. I slipped them on and looked in the mirror.
It was... Not like me to say the least, but I thought it looked rather cool. Washed them off.
I continued to bleed for several odd minutes, then tiredness began to set in. I don't know what I was thinking, but I know that I was controlling my own movements when I smeared my beard and mustache with my own blood.
It is kinda funny. The blood enhances the color of my already red facial hair. Go figure. The blood also has an interesting feeling when applied to the lips.

Who the hell is gonna read this anyway? =)
My livejournal never has any comments. But, who am I to contend with those on top of the popularity chain. Popularity is for the blinded. And Kurt Cobain knew it. I may or may not read his private journals. I have some respect for the dead in me yet.

By any chance anyone is reading this, all of it, I don't ask for much... Just a one word reply, any word of your choice.

My LiveJournal is literally fucked up... Why mess with a thing?

"event","Your dreams can tell you a lot about reality, and the non-reality. I have slept for 17 and a half hours this past day in hopes of correcting my sleeping habit. It got cut short when I was interupted, otherwise it would've been a full 24 hours.
During that dream I have recovered nearly completely and still have a cold. I feel both dizzy and full of energy.
I am not about to tell how my dream went. That is for more inquisitive folk to ask of me. In the meantime, I will just to what is not normal of me, to break out of my normal routine. I may need surgury, but I am not going to let that affect me.

Here, enjoy some test results that most befit me:

"event","The censors love to crack down on anything controversial... I am not even going to waste my time complaining about them. I will just say State of Emergency is great for relieving stress, a lot. (Emphesize on A LOT.)

I am the quiet one, but that does not mean, not dangerous. It means ""Explosive material, handle with care"".
Another pointless day is about to pass... I can't wait til the day of my surgury. Then I will be so terribly depressed I will just stay in my room and plot my return to this facade of a life I live. 

What plot? Oh well... Could be worse. My nose could be gushing blood. (Watch out for Penguin attacks!) *Pretends to mouth japanese.*

Out of context, I am doomed to act polite the rest of my life. Even my threats will sound like the breath of a gentleman's... *Shrugs.* (Whatever... This is not Hamlet!)

This is me! =D (I would thank people for the tests I find from thier LJ's, but that might be going too far.)

"event","Before I get started, I will explain the events of Saturday and Sunday briefly while listening to particularly angst-filled lyrics (Chop Suey, among others).

6pm,7pm-Sat: Tremaine came over. I borrowed Donnie Darko from Jova again and brought it to Tremaines with the intention of having it watched. Mission success... Or was it?
At his and his friend, Blackberry's home I sat on the couch after feeling the awkwardness that always happens in the home of others. Nervousness? Or perhaps it was the guilt kicking in. The small crowd also accompanied the familiar faces of Daveqat, Joe, and BJ.

730pm,830pm: We left for a chinese restaurant similar to Kings Buffet, but much more crowded. We ate, and I immediately noticed the wierd feeling that may require the ability of a surgeon. Not too much discomfort. I ate my plates full of breaded chicken, rice and shrimp while listening to the discussion between the other five.
I may not have known any of them for very long, but I know from the times I did that Joe tends to smile. None of my business, though I think that there might've been something bothering him.

9pm,???: Returned to Blackberry's pad and watched movies.

2am,???: Daveqat left, Joe had been asleep for awhile and Tremaine retired to bed. I remain restless, trying to put myself to sleep. I don't think it was the alcoholic drinks I had that was keeping me up. This was like the first day I had in the military...

4am,???: Unexpectedly, my nose begins to bleed. I wander to the bathroom and begin the process of stopping the blood flow whilst BJ and Blackberry watch an old Fantastic Four cartoon. I spend about 20 minutes in the bathroom... Good thing I cleaned up the mess, otherwise I would not be a very good guest..........

Skipping ahead: I notice a lot of things about others by keeping my pie-hole shut and observing. I won't get into it too much here, but I will add that they tend to ""speak thier mind"". I can relate with the group in some places. Curse my duel persona..


Went to the physician today. Whoop-dee-doo! He told me the same thing that I had already figured out days beforehand in my medical book. What a waste of 75 dollars... At least it's not cancer. I will have surgury in a few weeks, which I am not looking forward to for one reason only... Guilt.
Now how about some lyrics that may reflect my current mood. You ready?

I hurt myself today 
To see if I still feel 
I focus on the pain 
The only thing that's real 
The needle tears a hole 
The old familiar sting 
Try to kill it all away 
But I remember everything 

What have I become? 
My sweetest friend 
Everyone I know 
Goes away in the end 
You could have it all 
My empire of dirt 
I will let you down 
I will make you hurt 

I wear this crown of shit 
Upon my liar's chair 
Full of broken thoughts 
I cannot repair 
Beneath the stain of time 
The feeling disappears 
You are someone else 
I am still right here 

What have I become? 
My sweetest friend 
Everyone I know 
Goes away in the end 
You could have it all 
My empire or dirt 
I will let you down 
I will make you hurt 

If I could start again 
A million miles away 
I would keep myself 
I would find a way 
 

I am feeling kind of sad right now... Good thing I can remember the past from long ago. How many fools keep such memories? The lyrics to the past send electrical shivers through my body. So close to my birthday... 

When the first breath of winter through the flowers is icing 
And you look to the north and a pale moon is rising 
And it seems like all is dying and would leave the world to mourn 
In the distance hear the laughter...

I miss that movie...

"event","There are songs that everyone keeps dear and near to thier heart and soul. But, not everyone realizes that they themselves are modeled after a particular song that has already been created.
I believe I am a rare exception, that I have multiple such ""Theme songs"".
I've been called many things, by my friend's and foe's:
Hopeless Romantic, Sly, a Good Person, an A**hole, Psychotic, Depressed, Crazy, Lost, Pathetic, Knuckle Head, Mother F***er, Bastard, Four Eyes, Sad, Unstable, Suicidal, F***-Up, Idiot, Lazy, Hyper, Energetic, Sullen, I Wish You Were Dead, Punk, God, Worthless, Unable To Cope, Coward, Scarred For Life...... The list goes on and on and on.
There are others. I'd post if I could remember them all. I think my mood just changed again.
All I need now is to see a halucination of an evil brown bunny predicting the end of the world at the end of October. I should only be so lucky.
Animals can be humanized. How do you explain your pet dog or cat? But, is it us who are smart? Or have we just forgotten how much we used to be like them? Animals...
I feel mxed between emotions..
MY ENEMIES LIST: Shaun St. Marten, Mathew Del Rosario, Michael Lee Campbell, Jason Drinkwine, Peter Henry, Jason Rolens, Michael Munns, Michael Sebena, Richard Walters, Mathew Tucker, Luke Young.
These names I reflect on and feel rage. My current mood has flipped again, and now I am feeling a sense of accomplishment. I have it better than any and all of the names I have listed. Punks, Troublemakers, Losers, Rapists, Womanizers... two IQ pointed expletives. 
I will qoute a line from one of my favorite songs, You Get What You Give: 
You're all fakes 
Run to your mansions 
Come around 
I'll kick your ass in...

Rants of a lunatic. This world ends when I die. Hidden rage facades behind a wall of compressed hatred, being held at bay by both the inner child and the hopeless romantic listening to advise from his only friends of this world.
Thank you Mario. You are a good person, and I am glad to have met you.
My other friends I will thank too, at least they speak to me. =)

~Kit, in between emotions at the moment. Let's test our frame."

"event","I am inexperienced at burning CD's. I need new stimulus to reduce my boredom.
Just recently I got to see Donnie Darko, for the second time. That movie is such a classic, I am glad to have seen it. I owe Jova one for buying it, and showing it to me.
The music is so eerie. When I watched ""DD"" for the first time, the screen was small, and the sound was mono. But this time, I watched it on the 28"" screen with surround; The picture and sound were even greater...
I will get my songs, or kill Limewire. Preferably both.

"event","It has been weeks, or days since I've been able to come and write anything. These past few days things have been going all ""Donnie Darko"" with me. And today is no exception.
I feel that I should be on anti-depressants.
I can tell the future, but it is not a voluntary skill. It is ""Super-Involuntary"", and sketchy at best. I can remember my dreams fluently, but I never remember ""Deja-vu"", that is until it actually happens to me. But by then it's too late to do anything about it.
I live my day as it happens, but a little foresight helps me.
I don't feel like doing anything creative today, other than feeling horrible and drained. No amount of dream has told me of anything useful these past few days.
I wish I could see more of my friends. I could use an adventure out in the rain.
I feel I need to be wandering the world right now, physically, searching for something. Maybe my wish will come true. Most of them.
I have selected my Halloween costume I want. No one will know, except Jova, what is is.
(Sidetracked) 
Anyway, it seems most of my friends are spiritual, which is a big plus to me. Someday we will begin our nationwide travel, perhaps...
I don't feel like talking on AIM today, I'll do it later when creativity knocks.
I wish my friends never have to see me depressed. It has happened already. I find myself appologizing for no reason. I do it from force of habit.
My previous week was something to go through, and wonder how I made it past it.
One of my friends owns a jeep and came to my house to pick up me and a friend. Before she came, she took a ""acid""... She has a crush on me, but I don't take drugs. Good thing she retained her driving skills, cause the lights from other cars seemed to affect her vision.
My life is similar to ""Donnie Darko's"", except I don't let some rabbit from the future tell me what to do.
Enjoy my insatity while it's here. Thank you, all of my friends who read my rantings, and sometimes give me lectures of hope.

The anticipation for the event of the day was getting to me. It started out with me waking up to the faint smell of the past. A day from a memory long ago filled the air in my house, as it was a particularly good day.
   It felt no different today. I began the day (Starting at 1-PM) using some of my freetime to clean up a bit of the upstairs, helping my family members with thier various doings, and keeping my distance from my father. 
   Later on my parents fled the house, leaving my sister and I behind to watch ""UHF"". ""I hope you enjoy it!!"", I shouted at her as she put it into my PS2. After an hour and a half of ""Weird Al's"" lunacy, I began to get ready to go to Tremaine's.
   Success! I fit all that I planned to bring with me inside of a bag, put it along with another bag inside of a large duffel and zipped it shut. Who know's how much I can lift? The bag was fairly easy to pick up, despite it's decieving weight. Tremaine arrived just as he said he would. A friend indeed, as friends are tough to find and keep; I hope things don't go sour...
   Once inside of the fox's car, I felt even more at ease, yet still nervous. The pleasant smell of sour cherry's lingered about the cabin as I concentrated on keeping my nerves as calm as I could. Just a ten minute drive, and yet, if that ten minute drive had taken much longer, I would not have minded at all. Travel is in my blood, and we all know that a bit of adventure can go a long way. We arrived...

It started out like any other social event that I had gone to before: I entered Tremaine's domain, and was immediatly stared upon by the various wildlife from one location to another, like a new member of a secret society. I eased myself by snatching a couple of pretzels from a nearby bowl of the counter, and looking about the room for familiar faces.
   Daveqat was there, sitting on the couch, inviting me to sit next to him. Looking around some more I came upon a fellow of whom I met a few weeks ago, by the name of Kich. At the table to my right were two more of whom I know, Ms. Werellama and Joe, both going head to head in a card game of ""Harry Potter"". Mistletoe stood inside of the kitchen, talking amongst fellow furry's.
   After a while of standing about like a NAVY recruit at attention, I decided to make my way over to the couch, using my swift fox/catlike agility to stumble over randomly placed furry's and objects. Made it! The couch was comfortable, but cramped. I sat there for a moment before having an arm wrapped around me by Daveqat. He pulled me closer, and I immediatly fell into a spell of affectionation. The feeling of your presence being needed overcame my other thought of nervousness and put me at even more ease. I sat in his arms for just over twenty-five minutes, until he left the couch.
   Among the thoughts of the recent events there were other thoughts still lingering about. I watched as gifts between friends and loved ones were exchanged while they joked and hugged... Must the past constantly remind me of my happiness, of which I currently have just a spool of twine? Watching Ms. Becky and Mr. Joe fawn over eachother, as well as observing Tremaine and Mistletoe share they're feelings for eachother freely and truthfully makes me wonder, ""I am too young to think that there is not someone out there that I can do the same with.""
   We must be strong! Though appearances are most always decieving. I am not as evil as I look, but I won't argue if a person feels that I may bite their head off rather than socialize, if they feel that is the case. I am usually outgoing, but I will keep my reserve.
   After a brief lapse of bordom, I broke into my bag of trinkets and pulled out my handheld videogame. What happened next was a total shock to me, as I never would have imagined someone else doing it. Someone spoke to me, ""What game are you playing?"" I looked up. Kich stood over me with his eye intent on knowing. I happily responded by showing him. Success! I made a new freind, it seems. The more I look at him, the more I have the feeling that he reminds me of my freind Adam, who is currently putzing around in college out of state. Also, having recently watched ""UHF"", Kich also reminded me of ""Dr. Philo"", both his appearance and his voice. I kept my mouth shut, keeping all comments to myself that I felt were unneccesary or insulting , even if they weren't...
   After thanking Blackberry several times, we stayed within the confines of his room, challenging eachother to various duels of the mind and hand eye coordination. We exchanged vocalities at times, none at all hostile, but like old friends once lost to the sands of time. Perhaps it feels that way to us all, but I know an old soul when he or she talks with me for a few minutes.
   Orion arrived a little afterwards, breaking out his X-box for whoever wanted to play. Hours passed by like a good bottle of wine being sampled by beggers.

Rather than have this whole thing turn into a short book, I'll end it here... Finish it elsewhere then make it into a short story.

~Kit, love to my friends, all of whom I would follow. What dream may come tomorrow?"

DON'T KNOW WHY

I waited 'til I saw the sun
I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of day 
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever

Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road along

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever

Something has to make you run
I don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come


What a nice song, so calm and mellow. =)
The song sounds sweeter if you shut your eyes and listen to it. Perhaps if you did you'll understand how it felt to me. (Murr)
I'll have to tell of my previous days experience, as it turned out very well, as opposed to how I usually feel. (Murrrrrrrrrrr)

~Kit, happy at the moment."

"event","Okay, don't get me wrong if you think this is gonna be ALL about my depression, 'cause it's not.
I occasionally sort through the thousands of thoughts and memories in my head that have accumulated over the years.
I have come to a conclusion that I hope happens when I die. I don't expect anyone to understand what it feels like exactly, just to read and have fair judgement:

When I die, and my soul is set free from this prison, I should hope to go back in time, and relive my childhood as it really happened. All of my friends know me (All that I have met throughout my entire life), and might often come to my door and ask to go on a crazy adventure...
At my funeral, I have specifically requested the music I want played. All of which has had meaning to my thoughts, and memories... I want LANDSLIDE to be played... The LANDSLIDE that was performed by Stevie Nicks...
I'm getting older, too...
=)

Now, onto a more lighter note from the pace of the heavy heart. Tremaine is a very understanding person/fur-iend. I'll be at his party this coming weekend, don't mind the DEAD person on the couch...
I'll watch Cannibal the musical again, if it were present. Schplanoigal!
I will bring a few DVD'CD's with me to his next gathering. I'll have no boredom going on, even if I am the silent newcomer..
I won't forget ""Einhander"" as I know someone is bound to have a PS2 with then one way or another. 
Since it would take a month or so, or perhaps a few good hours, I will only tell my childhood to any who will listen...
I think part of my grandfather is trying to take me over, as I am feeling, nostalgic at the moment. Instead of recanting a childhood story, just look at the thingy below.

I know what Scamps was talking about... I am not forgetful of things easily, though sometimes it seems like the best...
If she does forget me, I only hope she remembers me for who I was, as not for how she thinks of me now...
The above statement has nothing to do with BLADE 2, so don't think it does...
That movie made me forget about the obscurity that is my life. I also thought it was interesting to find that Danny John-Jules who played ""Cat"" on ""Red Dwarf"" was one of the main charactors, sort of. I knew he looked familiar. =)
...
This is not about the movie anymore. A certain someone who knows who she is sent me a package many many months ago... It still smells as lovely as I first opened it.
I won't burn anything you've sent me...
I am planning something, but so far the idea is ""Lost in the Mail"" so to speak.
*Moans...* (The new cat we recently got is beginning to bug me... Now.)
*Sigh...*
Humans are animals, no matter what they say. 
Animals are probably the best friend that will never turn away from you...
My mood is taking over, I have drawn a few things, and they seem to help. I should probably thank someone for this...
I need my friends... All of them, no matter how far away.

Scamps, the dear girl I know more about than any other person I've been with. She has made me happy in the past... YES she has! If I have ever hurt her, ever, it was not my intention, please forgive me...
Desertwind...The person who is one year older than I... I agreed to have him as my mentor. But, I am rarely able to talk to him when he comes on. And whenever we do talk, it seems that he never has anything to say to me. Like he knows everything.
...No-one can know everything.
(MD returns, beware the horrifying truth.)
I always meet people face to face eventually. I always feel jittery, and tense. Sarah promised that we would meet, and I don't plan to break it. But if she wishes... Then I can do naught.
Hey here's a tip: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Another tip: There is no true god.
Yet another tip: Those with manic depression switch moods easily, and live shorter than those who don't have it.
Last tip: You should never argue with a crazy man...

Well, seeing as how some awful news just got me in a such a great mood... Not really.

It seems that not many people care, or maybe they do, but never tell you in time before you finally do something desperate. How fucked up is that?
Here's my phone number... Come and kill me. Or don't...

Courage and stupidity go together, I have no regrets.
At least I tried to open up. I'll feel differently tomorrow.
Sarah... I still love you. Hate me if you must.

My fucking life has gone wrong as it were.
Should've been in some adventure. Chrono Trigger connects with me in so many ways. *Deep Groan.*
Confort those you care about, and they'll return the favor...

"event","I feel very good right now. I am feeling very affectionated for the moment, and it won't last long because of the MD (Manic Depression), so I'll have to type this with a smile.
Mistletoe is a very nice fur-iend, Daveqat, too. And the others, I probably will melt with 'em too. (As the song goes.)
I'll stop the world and melt with you.
Usually a serious looking creature with the super-fair skin color and staring at people through half-closed gray-blue eyes, I am not trying to shy people away from me. I don't mind the company, at least a few furs spoke to me...
*Stop the thoughts, stop the thoughts of MD...*
Okay, since what I thought would stay away for a while has come back, I am now going to say some things that should be considered posative, even though I may forget what I say later. All I have to say about this is (This goes for anyone else...) Crash... into me.
Here goes!

Jaguarundi is an awesome artist... I am envious. I love her taste in music. (Oooooooo... Nintendo music and remix's... I'll bet she even has Mute City from F-zero.) *Sigh.* I don't know her, just what I saw from her site. 

Mistletoe said backscratches are nice... I doubt myself. I should really stop the doubt, if only I knew that it were not true to some degree. Showing off is a bad thing for me... It doesn't even cross my mind until it is a few hours past. Erf... If the other person is bothered by an itch on their back, or maybe they are just feeling down, it seems like it might help, would it not?

Daveqat is a sweet, kind... My eyes are hurting... *Wipes eyes clean of wetness.* Warmth is nice... Distance is bad. Skull and crossbones bad. 

Okay... Let's see.

Karun doesn't know much of me other than he creamed me in Timesplitters; I am doubtful of how I played, was totally unprepared... *Shrugs* I'll bring ""The Bouncer"" or something next time. =)

Orion was the one with the orange shorts. =) I'd have joined in TWISTER, if it weren't for my fear of how I appear to myself in my mind. That, and the possibility of an endless game that will only end if either of us collapse from heat exhaustion. Oh yeah, and the fact that my joints tend to crack eerily at inopportune times.

Tremaine... He said positive things of me... I only know a few people that ever say things like that. He wants to meet me, but I only fear of going to his place and talking too much. 

That's not all... There are a few others.

The owner of the house whose party I graced with my presence. (Ooooh, such intellectual words I spew forth from my maw.) *Grandious applause coming from the abyss.*
The owner of the house, who threw the party, I want to thank them for allowing me to mingle until Monday morning... *Sigh* I wish I were more able to just say things to peoples faces as openly as I do here.

Straifywoof... The Irish, the provider of the ride to and from the party. I must thank him too. The ride was enjoyable, the wind feels great against the skin, but it's effects on long hair are undesirable. I looked like Jack Nicolson from ""The Shining""... 

Aside from meeting a few new furry's, I also was reminded by a few others faces... Those faces reminded me of people who they may or may not know what the bloody hell I'm talkin' about.
For instance, there was a male (Technical? Or blunt?) that constanly reminded me of ""The writer who teamed up with his 40 year old friends to kill Pennywise in the movie, ""IT"""". Just his appearance, though he may in fact BE a writer. *Shrugs.*

Enough about Stephen King, my mood has changed for the better know. I think this bout of MD has fled to regroup. =D
In general, I thank everyone who at least looked at me without cringing.
I now have a (Pet) cat, and I think that is part of the reason I feel happy. A little kitten that is only beginning to trust me.
If it weren't for my mother having allergic reactions, it would probably stay here. Time will tell if she decides she doesn't want it... I'll just have ta go along.

This is getting too long... Still got my smile. Take THAT manic deppresion!"

"event","True to its saying. The old will always be, and the new will always learn from the old. Most kids born in any given time period eventually find out sooner or later.
I also have had very realistic dreams for the past two nights. In both dreams I've had, a ""white wolf"" is stalking me... On the second night, the wolf came closer to me, in my backyard next to my van andbegan licking my hand. I don't know if it will happen again, but I hope it does... Funny thing though, the wolf appeared on the second night I started praying to ""Inari""...  
As of now, I am in the midst of being content and being down and out. 
After tonight I plan to concentrate on several things to make me feel at ease.

1) I plan to induce dizziness and lay in my bed until I pass out.
2) I plan to finish my novel before the ideas (Which I have written down in another notebook elsewhere) go stale and I have to repeat the process from the beginning.
3) Strengthen my left arm and elbow to take more solid hits so I don't wind up hurting myself in a tight spot.
4) The job crisis is not helping me much, and telling the truth on the applications does not seem to be of much help. I will from now on leave the entire ""previous job"" column empty.
5) Listen to my friends and stick by them whenever the chance appears. Going mad with your friends is VASTLY better than going mad alone.
Now for some poetry...

When I was young I knew everything
She a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt stricken, sobbing with my head on the floor
Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice

I can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth of valium and slept
Now he's guilt stricken sobbing with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept he says

I can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

We've tried to wash our hands of all of this
We never talk of our lacking relationships
And how we're guilt stricken sobbing with our heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say

I can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

For the life of me I cannot remember

No time for mourning... Ain't got no time...

I can't say I feel very ""Grand"" right now...
Depression makes you think unclearly. Depression also does NOT go well together with any other kind of illness. Especially if that illness is of the digestive tract.
Who's to say why I am really depressed... One of my new friends has told me something that is almost very certainly true: The people that are close to you will probably most likely hate you, and the ones further away are the ones who actually care about you.
I'm not saying that that is entirely true, but it's pretty fucking close.
I know two people from Australia (As I keep mentioning), and so far they've told me repeatedly that they would meet me. I have said the same thing to them, and I meant it with all of my soul.
My stomache is churning now, and I believe it was from that ""Bacon"" that my mother insisted we have. I cooked it, and I made damn sure that it WAS burnt so that it would be safe to eat. This bacon, mind you, has been sitting in the fridge for at least half a month, and the fact that I found ""Brown"" spots of meat on it did not sit well with me.
Scamps is most likely telling you the truth when she tells you stuff about meat. I think NOW I should give up bacon...
Depression is a sickness.
And when I get depression, I am very iratable and would rather not do anything. (Not too disimilar than a woman with PMS.)
The only things that DO sound good to me during depression are far too little.
I would not care who gives me a fucking hug, as long as they were a close friend. And so far, the only one who fits that description is Scamps... Desertwind is a possibility...
On that such list, believe it or not, is ""hurting myself"", surprise-surprise. And Yes, that thought can escalate into ""Suicide""...
I also tend to think of the past. I know ""death"" more than most people know their own parents. I have had friends die on me, and animals, too.
And I shouldn't have to tell my friends to go read my personal outcries... But I will! Inari and fate knows I will.
Yeah you heard me right! I'm a Kitsune and proud as fuck to be. And the fact that I'm in tune to my emotions far better than most people care to be is a double-edged blade of doom...
There are too many religions in this ""hell"" we call earth. Believe it or not this IS ""Hell"". And it is also ""Heaven"". It just depends on what you make of it.
So far it has been hell for me. But I know my friends are helping me. Inari knows they are.
Desertwind is probably trying to help me too...
...
Maybe it wasn't the bacon afterall. I also had BurgerKing...
*Tries hard to not think of it, and drinks his ginger-ale.*
I need confort too... And affection, like any creature placed on this ""Heaven and Hell"".
I don't think of ""sex"" all of the time, and it seems that of the people I now or have met are thinking about it 85% of the time I'm with them. They may also be thinking of me while thinking about sex........... And for that I don't care.
Everybody is different, and if the world were full of the same people we'd all be strangling ourselves with thick fucking nooses tied to the Gallows.
The so called (Pure hearted) ""White Knights"" are NOT fairie tales... There are people believe it or not that ARE, in spirit. I just can't make assuptions yet. No-one has the right to call themselves ""White Knights"".

I am a fox in spirit, and a Kitsune. Desertwind and I are alike. Whether you want to call me crazy is really your decision.
But if Sarah kills herself... I might as well not be alive either!
And Jason would do the same thing too!
Then all three of us would be together...
I don't want fucking pity god-damn you! I want to be loved like any other...
My head hurts...
I sicken me...


I take back what I said about ""Creed"". 

The court is in session, a verdict is in
No appeal on the docket today, just my own sin
The walls are cold and pale the cage made of steel
Screams fill the room alone I drop and kneel
Silence now the sound my breath the only motion around
Demons cluttering around my face showing no emotion
Shackled by my sentence expecting no return
Here there is no penance my skin begins to burn

So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside which
Only fuels there selfish pride
We're all held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We the meek are all in One

I hear a thunder in the distance see a vision of a cross
I feel the pain that was given on that sad day of loss
A lion roars in the darkness only He holds the key
A light to free me from my burden and grant me life eternally

Should have been dead on a Sunday morning 
banging my head
No time for mourning ain't got no time

So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside which
Only fuels there selfish pride
We're all held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We the meek are all in One

I cry out to God seeking only His decision
Gabriel stands and confirms
I've created my own prison

So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside which
Only fuels there selfish pride
We're all held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We the meek are all in One

I've created...I've created...I've created...
I've created...I've created...I've created...
Should have been dead on a Sunday morning 
banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time

"event","For those who don't know, ecstatic means ""Overjoyed"".
It seems that I get these rare attacks only once in a great while, even if I was recently experiencing deep depression moments before hand.
Anyway, it came to me while I was writing part of my novel.
The song ""Eat the Rich"" by Aerosmith just popped into my head the moment I thought about one of the charactors.
One of the charactors is a Dragon, and is asleep when two creatures come across him.
No more story give away, this is all you get until it gets finished AND is either ""On the market"" or in a furry magazine.
I get really excited when my imagination is at full drive, much like Scamps get's when she is drawing.
Actually, I was thinking of that sweet statement/phrase Steven Tyler says at the beginning of ""Eat the Rich"" that got me overjoyed.
It goes:

Wake up kid, it's half past your youth,
  Ain't nothin' really changin' but the date.
You were a grandslammer but you're no Babe Ruth,
  You gotta learn how to relate.
I'm swingin' from the pearly gates.
  I got all the answers, but low and behold,
You got the right key baby but the wrong.. key.. hole.. yo..!


Steven Tyler rocks! Joe Perry is a killer guitarist... And the whole group has kept together for so many years and not betrayed their fans... Not like what Metallica did. They were killer in the early 90's and before that.
Feeling quite buzzed, I will leave with the saying: 
What is this?
A center for ants!? How are we to expect children to learn how to read, if they can't evn fit inside the building...?
*Gives a wide ""Allanis Morrestte"" smile, as seen in ""Dogma""*

Bye all! Enjoy this life while you can, cause when you die, you'll have to do it all over again from scratch in another dimension. (Or dimentia...)

But it's as I've been saying all my fucking life. You should never argue with a crazy man...
The crazy man is stubborn and will rarely change his mind. Money... Ha! People fall in love with money, and today I just met the most charming teenager to love it.
My LJ is not for flamers. Either keep your mouth shut, or say something that won't cause your computer to freeze...
I can be very reasonable, and I listen to people more than they give credit for.
Work is for suckers, but whenever I have a job I work my ass off for other people. Shit, I can even work much harder than the managers at times.
I don't need pity... I need encouragement, and unfortunately, I don't get much of it.
Human's, least of all. understand me.
Desertwind is being very nice to me... I think. Considering how much I was against him in the past months. He, and Scamps are the two I trust most... And I would trust them with my very soul. Oh and by the way... They are not even from THIS dump, which is now run by ""BUSH"" (Your favorite president)... I trust Australians more than I can trust Americans now. Thanks USA for always being there, NOT!
For those who HAVE responded with kindness and sincerity, and used more than five word sentances, you will not be forgotten, ever. Such individuals are few and far between, and they are always with me. Even those among the dead.

I am alone. And there are not very many good souled people anymore. I myself only met a few. My family is growing old of me, and I feel more distant... From everyone.
I only want to feel needed.
Scamps was always there for me, and I was there for her... Tremaine, Mistletoe, Artemisfur, Daveqat and Grayfoxofwinter may be new to me, but they were still somewhat there for me. Maybe they still are. Isolation is bad, and forgetfulness of someone is also as worse.
I don't feel hungry right now...
Sorry to everyone who has to read this... But I know that not many will. What a meaningless existance...

*Smiles sadly. Listens to a sad, sad... lonely song.*
http://www.reflectionshawaii.com/lounge/
To any who care...
The song is ""Gloomy Sunday"".


Sunday is Gloomy,
My hours are slumberless,
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless 
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you 
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you 

Gloomy Sunday

Sunday is gloomy with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be flowers and prayers that are sad,
I know, let them not weep,
Let them know that I'm glad to go 
Death is no dream,
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you 

Gloomy Sunday 

Dreaming
I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of
My heart
Dear 

Darling I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you 

Gloomy Sunday"

But nevermind that, now.
I should've been done writing this by now, but got to talking to an interesting person. (Or maybe it was just me rammbling and the person just forced to listen.)
I was at the Wilmot county fair yesterday night (Saturday), with my family. I can't imagine a life without them, as it seems they are what keep me going at times when they don't get mad with me.
Anyway, the fair didn't have as many annoying ""Human"" fiends as I remembered, but they were still there.
I took the ""Rock Climbing"" challenge twice, and succeeded both times. I didn't fall, and I reached the top. Go me!
I am not afraid of bodily harm too much it seems.
Only a crazy person would hold a live BABY ALLIGATOR! I jumped at the opportunity.
There were a lot of farm animals there. I got to pet the goats that stared at me with thier sad eyes....
Then there was the commerce building. They were selling the very furs that I was complaining about a few LJ's back.
*Sigh* Fox tails are said to have magic properties with them... They were selling them for 6 dollars... Each. As well as coyote tails. Fox, skins ferrets skins, Even wolf skins hung like haunting peices of garment, only to be sold as throw-rugs to heartless bastards and sympethetic animal lovers...
The rides were great, if only to relieve me for a few hours of my normal life. 
I knew that carnies ""Rip"" people off and swindle, but that didn't stop me from being an idiot. I am a marksman, but the rifles that carnies allow you to use are inaccurate and unstable. And overused by those without responsibility.
I was ""Content"" before I started writing this. I've changed my mind.
Maybe later I'll finish how the evening went.



Hush now, don't you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream
Spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over... or has it just begun?
There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize it and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly you hear and see
This magic new dimension
I- will be watching over you
I- am gonna help you see it through
I- will protect you in the night
I- am smiling next to you, in Silent Lucidity
[Visualize your dream]
[Record it in the present tense]
[Put it into a permanent form]
[If you persist in your efforts]
[You can achieve dream control]
[Dream control]
[How's that then, better?]
[Hug me]
If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin
Living twice at once you learn
You're safe from the pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...
I- will be watching over you
I- am gonna help to see it through
I- will protect you in the night
I- am smiling next to you...."

Most of the music in Smash Bros. Melee was Orchastrated, not synthetically but by real musicians bearing instruments.
Plus, the game can relieve you of stress! (Proven fact, 'cause I said so, damn-it!) There have been several occasions while playing the game where I broke out in hysterical laughter, either by an unexpected ""Self-Destruct"", or from knocking several charactors off the screen over and over again (While playing on the ""Big Blue"" is extremely hysterical, especially when you can change the music of the stages.)

*The (Now semi-happy) red fox returns to the computer after fininshing burglerizing the mansion in the new ""Resident Evil"" game several times.*

Whew... those were the best seven days I've had playing that game. So to speak. Damn... I just wish that ""Smash Brothers Melee"" wasn't sold out..........
*Shrugs* Oh well, I'll get it next time! And I think I got my imagination back sometime during that past week. Also, I didn't even care what I was thinking about previously when I got ""GameCube"". Screw thoughts of sadness, I'm just going to shoot a zombie whenever I feel horid.

Which brings up another subject. The god dmaned dog across the alley does not know when to shut up. I assumed it was our dog and had no choice but to get out of bed to see what the hell was the problem. Well, the dog across the alley isn't much of a creature anyway, but he is still very annoying. Just to shut the bloody thing up I attempted to scare it by tapping the window with my knuckle... That was the fiftieth mistake I've made yet, this year. The window shattered, and took a minor piece of my flesh along with it. I shrugged off the bleeding, but the window would not be fixed as easily. Damned if it did not break all the other times I tapped it. I didn't even hit the thing that hard even.
Oh well... Got no money to fix it, and Dr. Fei is not cooporative in taking care of his house. (He owns this death trap.)

*Looks over the LJ's of the ""Others""...* Wow, I don't know why everybody's in a sad mood (Oooh, what a liar I am.). Actually I'm too busy right now. I am forced to be busy now due to me breaking the window. I swear that the dog across the alley, whose name is ""Harley"", will eventually lose his voice. Not by me. By time, and overuse.

Since my current mood IS waning just a bit, I shall try and remember all of the ideas I've been meaning to use for my several novels. And no, I am never going to tell my ideas, as there are jibba jabba sucka foo's who really DO and would take them for their own use. So, only when my first book is finished (In oh, Say... five years, or until I die.) will anyone ever get to read what I am thinking, so please stop asking all of whom this may concern.

So in conclusion... If I ever die (It won't happen, and I know it, since there is a god out there somewhere with a sense of humor.) may it be in some far away place doing what I love doing. Inhaling molten rock!
Actually, if I ever die, it will probably be by my foolish choices. Afterall, my luck is great, but it will not always be there.

*The fox looks over his shoulder, hearing whispers from the other room.*
Huh? Oh yeah! So in closing, tommorow will probably not work out either. Got my haircut yesterday but am seriously considering ""Cutting"" off the rest of what was supposed to be a fox tail. My face does not look good (To me.) without some hair covering most of me noggin'. Maybe I should start over and do it like ""Aragorns"" (You know the book. And the movie.).

And don't forget. If you ever encounter a zombie, just remember: You can destroy it with fire, or you can cut off and/ or destroy the head. =D
Don't forget your medical spray, and always carry a key. You never know whose house may contain a special item that may help you live.
Oh... And don't ever try to kill a giant spider with a knife...
And when all else fails... Just make sure you've gone into the clothes storage and picked out your favorite outfit. You don't want to die looking like a fashion victim, do you? =D
(Just a little Resident Evil humor, even if they were terrible jokes. Just as long as it made you smile!)

Find anyone else who doesn't like such a cruelty (Albeit pathetically cowardice of the ones preforming it)... Maybe group up, and pick a victim.

(This hot headed ""Genko"" will probably cool down and forget about this whole Journal entry. Sooooo... Before I end this, I am going to do... THIS!)

Aww... Fuck. I like meat. I am not a vegetarian... But I knew of the ""Factory Farming"", long before I knew a freind who is stuck working in such a factory. Her name will not be mentioned. 
This sucks... I will probably forget about it though the next time I eat... 

I know of more places to put down here. Who of the readers has enough guts to look at them, know what it's like to cringe. DO IT!

"event","Remembering is a good thing, and bad. *Sigh.* I need a mentor... Any volunteers?
...
Didn't think so... My father hasn't been there much for me, like another person I know. He doesn't seem all that bad, but those many years living here and going to school... The kids I went to school with were all (In Jasons words) Pr*cks. Maybe even more. We are very much alike, but my jealousy has always gotten in the way of things. What can I say? It's my fault isn't it? It's not the father who has always put his children down, but the fathers kids.
I don't believe anyone can help me, short of stab through the heart by a silver stake. I dwell on things too much... As friendly creatures keep telling me (All of which know who they are).
I am the most emmotional person I know. (Everybody else thinks that they are too. Makes no difference in this overpopulated world.) But people think alike.
Someones dream came true. A couple of people I know have had dreams come true. Jason... Sarah... John...
It is not honorable to see anyone cry. I have ashamed someone. She does not need it. I am by no means a selfish man, though at times I may act so...
I have a cousin... Born to my brother, John, and his lovely wife Rachel... Seeing them together has its effects on me too. So if you're thinking that it is just one thing, fuck off. It is several things. I do believe I am a Kitsune. But I can be anything I want, not just one. There isn't a bridge long enough to take me where I want to go, and only after my host body dies, I will get my wish.
My main concern (As a few may think) is not far away on another continent, but here...
My mother is in pain, constantly. I can't do anything...
I'm a hopeless object, used by many, but loved by few.
I guess you people (Human or creature, does it matter?) might call me a puppet. A tool for which its only purpose is to be used.
When my master dies, I will be passed onto another.
Puppet, puppet... Useless souless puppet only good for when someone needs it. When my master dies, the mother, then another master will snatch me up. Too bad for the lack of a mentor.
I am also what most might call a loyal watchdog, faithful to its master until the masters or its own death.
I have a couple of songs that take me to another realm... But only a few creatures know what if feels like to listen to them, let alone want to listen to them, LET alone even heard them before...


Uh huh, life's like this 
Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is

You're watching your back like you can't relax 
You're tryin' to be cool you look like a fool to me 
Tell me 

Why you have to go and make things so complicated? 
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated 
Life's like this you 
And you fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get and you turn it into honesty 
and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
no no no 

You come over unannounced 
dressed up like you're someone else 
where you are and where it's sad you see 
you're making me 
laugh out when you strike your pose
take off all your preppy clothes 
you know you're not fooling anyone

I never could accept defeat... But I have sworn to an Honorable Samurai's code asked by a bum I accidentally ran into in Okinawa, Japan. (This is a true story, And the only man that would beleive it is long now dead.)
I met him when I ventured outside of the military housing base on my own. I had a couple of yen (Japanese currency) which was given to me by my mother. I figured that there was a store I could burn it at somewhere around the base. (I was 8 at the time. Stupid kid stuff, and don't think I wasn't grounded for that.)
The gates on the military base were locked, but I got around them through the back end. Across the street was a japanese store, and the money was burning a whole in my kid sized pockets. Traversed across the street and entered. 
After spending the yen on some kind of jelly candy, I heard the voice of a man whispering to me from the space between the store and another building. The man looked like your average bum... But it wasn't by his appearance that made me walk in there, but I do remember how I felt.
Being a curious kid, I went in, without thinking of the danger I was most likely to be in. The man was old... And from what I can tell was suffering from a cough. He was japanese, but he knew how to speak american, as I can remember only a little of what he said.
Though he did mention something about the bombing of hiroshima, it didn't seem to matter that I was american... He said something like ""Kids are tools for the war propaganda"" or something along those lines. But he also said he followed the ways of bushido, since he was a youngster. I didn't know what that was until I asked my parents some time later that day. 
But the funny thing about him, he did not seem crazy in the way he talked. He also spoke some Japanese but broke off into english words during a part...
I left that crevice between the buildings... I swear I heard the man cry, but I didn't want to go back inside.
There was much more that he said... Fucking age. That man is most certainly dead. He never told me his name, and I never will...
After I came back onto the military housing base I went back to my house... But with a suprise. Some of the neighborhood kids who knew me, saw me leaving the base, and spoke to my mother in my absence, (I was grounded, as I said before) and she was so angry... And relieved. She told me I could've disappeared by way of kidnapping. That too stuck in my head. I never did tell anyone about the old man in the dark crevice between the buildings, ever since.
Believe what you want. If you want proof, I can post a couple of my (Okinawan) travel pictures up from several years past.
The day we left Okinawa, Japan was not a happy day.
And I swore to go back there, in any form, by any means neccesary.
And as for the old man, who is by now dead, I will visit that crevice (Or alley if you prefer) where he once remained.
*Sigh...*
Another mentor gone, I suppose.
I guess that's all for now...
So little friends, so much time, so little left to be happy for.
See you later, mates.

Uh, could I have a drink of water?
Ya want some? Huh?
Oh wow! Look at this tub!

Hello?
Are you feeling ok?-)

Day after day,
Our love turns gray,
Like the skin on a dying man.
And night after night,
We pretend it's all right,
But I have grown older,
And you have grown colder,
And nothing is very much fun, anymore.
And I can feel,
One of all my turns coming on.
I feel,
Cold as a razor blade,
Tight as a tourniquet,
Dry as a funeral drum.

Run to the bedroom,
In the suitcase on the left,
You'll find my favorite axe.
Don't look so frightened,
This is just a passing phase,
One of my bad days.
Would you like to watch TV?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate a silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly? -- Would ya?
Would you like to see me try?
Ooohh. No!
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?

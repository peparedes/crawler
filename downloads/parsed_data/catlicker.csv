alas, all I can do is post the lyrics to one of the 
greates songs of all time! 



Ground(Acoustic Version)
by Assemblage 23


 
Be still
Though chaos rains around you now
Only so much rain can fall at once
Breathe in
And let the air envelope you
And slow but sure, serenity will come

Close your eyes
Try to breathe
Feel the ground beneath your feet
It's still there
The world still turns around

Stand up
Though circumstance has knocked you down
There is nothing gained by staying within it's reach

Take strength
In every failure you endure
Our mistakes have many lessons they can teach

Close your eyes
Try to breathe
Feel the ground beneath your feet
It's still there
The world still turns around

Destroy
These walls you've built around yourself
You can't take another step until they're gone

Move out
No use in dwelling in the past
Bid farewell to all your fears and carry on

Close your eyes
Try to breathe
Feel the ground beneath your feet
It's still there
The world still turns around

I did find the regular version of the song as an AMV
However the acoustic version the one that is AMAZING

"event","TUCSON, Ariz. (March 12) - About 800 small dogs, including Chihuahuas, terriers and Pomeranians, were seized from a triple-wide mobile home whose occupants were overwhelmed trying to care for the animals, authorities said Wednesday.

About 800 small dogs were seized from a triple-wide mobile home outside Tucson, Ariz., this week. ""The home was definitely in very bad condition, urine and feces all over the home, in the kitchen and bedroom, with a very strong odor,"" a Humane Society spokeswoman said.

Pima County sheriff's deputies and animal welfare officials who removed the dogs also found 82 caged parrots in the home in a rural area northwest of Tucson.

Some dogs were pregnant and giving birth as they were taken to shelters in Tucson, said Jenny Rose, a spokeswoman for the Humane Society of Southern Arizona. Ninety-six dogs were taken from the house Monday and another 700 on Wednesday, she said.

""The home was definitely in very bad condition, urine and feces all over the home, in the kitchen and bedroom, with a very strong odor,"" she said. ""Obviously, 800 dogs in a triple-wide mobile home, they were packed in there. That being said, they were in pretty good shape.""

The elderly owners, who have not been identified, were apparently overwhelmed but have cooperated with authorities, sheriff's Sgt. James Ogden said. No charges have been filed, but authorities continue to investigate.

The animals appeared to have had enough food, but a few were missing paws - some from having been attacked by other animals, others apparently having caught their feet in fencing outside, Rose said.

The breeds included Chinese cresteds and Lhasa apsos. The owners were breeding and offering the dogs for sale, Rose said, but she described it as a hoarding case, in which elderly people sometimes feel no one else can give their animals a good home and won't part with them.

Deputies were alerted this month after a woman who bought a Chihuahua at the home reported the conditions, Ogden said.

The dogs living inside the house apparently had free run of the premises, Ogden said. Others were found in other structures on the property.

Ogden described the living conditions as ""horrible, filth everywhere ... probably one of the worst (situations) I've ever seen.""

The animals will be offered for adoption soon, Rose said, adding that a rescue group from Phoenix had taken 100 of the dogs.

Sun Jul 1, 5:12 PM ET

NEW YORK - A peacock that roamed into the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant was attacked by a man who vilified the bird as a vampire, animal-control authorities said. 

Beaten so fiercely that most of his tail feathers fell out, the bird was euthanized, said Richard Gentles, a spokesman for the city's Center for Animal Care and Control.

""It's just unbelievable that someone would do something to a poor, defenseless animal and do it in such a cruel fashion,"" he said.

The peacock, a male several years old, wandered into a Burger King parking lot in the New York borough of Staten Island and perched on a car hood Thursday morning. Charmed employees were feeding him bread when the man appeared.

He seized the iridescent bird by the neck, hurled it to the ground and started kicking and stomping the creature, said worker Felicia Finnegan, 19.

""He was going crazy,"" she said.

Asked what he was doing, she said, the attacker explained, ""'I'm killing a vampire!'""

Employees called police, but the man ran when he saw them. Authorities were looking for the attacker, described as in his teens or early 20s.

It was not clear how the bird made his way to the Burger King, but a Staten Island resident who raises peacocks said he had given some to a person who lives near the restaurant."

We should build a skyscraper-sized toaster, plug it in and drop it in the ocean electrocuting all the varmints in there. After that drain it and build some ballsy skateboard parks!<br /><br />The Second Thing:<br />I can only eat egg whites if they are colored with a yellow food dye appearing like they are regular eggs. When I say ""these are delicious regular eggs"" you respond with ""yes they look like tasty regular eggs and NOT egg whites.""<br /><br />The Third Thing:<br />I've invented a device that mathematically figures out who is the most boring person at a party and shoots a deadly laser at them killing them close to instantly.*1<br /><br />The Fourth Thing:<br />My biggest regret in life is not having a really big regret. <br /><br />The Fifth Thing:<br />One time a ghost appeared to me and told me I was going to do great things in this lifetime. I responded by trapping him in my Proton Pack and delivering it to the <br />Ecto-Containment Unit. You see, Dr. Peter Venkman is a dear friend of mine and some ghost with his tricky horseshit will not persuade me other wise.<br /><br />The Sixth Thing:<br />There is no better feeling in the whole wide world than when the cop that is following behind your car takes a left. Especially when you DO have a body in your trunk. <br /><br />The Seventh Thing:<br />There is nothing funnier than someone that is not funny trying to convince other people that someone isn't funny. <br /><br />The Eighth Thing:<br />A young boy looked at his mother and asked her, ""Mom is there a God?"" <br /><br />The mother looked, smiled and responded, ""I really don't think so."" <br /><br />This boy then went to his father and asked, ""Dad is there a God?"" <br /><br />The dad looked, grinned and replied, ""Yes. I know there is."" <br /><br />Later that night the three of them were driving to grab dinner at a place where lower middle class people eat when a logging truck ran a red light and hit them head on. The mother died the father lived and the boy was badly hurt by a log that bashed into his body. <br /><br />Oprah called and had the father and son on her popular syndicated talk show and she asked the boy if he believed in God. The boy looked, smirked and replied ""I'm on Oprah so what do you think?!""<br /><br />Later that night the logger that drove the truck in a fit of rage because he was not asked to participate in the panel discussion on Oprah (yet he was invited to sit in the audience which is still pretty prestigious but certainly not as validating as sitting on the actual couch with Oprah) went into a blind white rage and killed the father and son, dug up the mothers body and put the three of them in a tree fort he built for his son Jarvis dressing them in army uniforms wearing wigs, costume jewelry and smart casual footwear. <br /><br />A year later the logging trucker guy was the LEAD GUEST on Oprah live from prison and his new book ""LOGGING, KILLING, CATS and OTHER DAILY STUFF"" is a bestseller.<br /><br />I think we all know that there IS a God but He is very drunk, somewhat troubled and obviously extremely shy hence He doesn't care for the question about him existing or not so let's focus on something else for right now.<br /><br />The Ninth Thing:<br />Nobody can tell you that you won't make it in this world. Yet, if we can rally everyone in the world to tell you that you won't make it than it's true. You really have no shot because all of us don't care for your work and we are the world. Odds are you will be fine but have a back up plan in case all of us come calling with some bad news. <br /><br />The Tenth Thing:<br />If I went to college I would major in Apology. <br /><br />*1 - Pending approval with the FCC and people that like coming to my parties.</b></p>"

"event","Are you tired of those sissy-ass ""friendship"" poems that
always sound good, but never actually come close to reality? Well, here is a series of promises that actually speak of true friendship:

1. When you are sad -- I will help you get drunk and plot revenge against the sorry bastard who made you sad.

2. When you are blue -- I will try to dislodge whatever is choking you.

3. When you smile -- I will know you finally got laid.

4. When you are scared -- I will rag on you about it every chance I get.

5. When you are worried -- I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be until you quit whining.

6. When you are confused -- I will use little words.

7.. When you are sick -- Stay the hell away from me until you are well again. I don't want whatever you have.

8. When you fall -- I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.

9. This is my oath..... I pledge it to the end. ""Why?""  you may ask; ""because you are my friend"".

Send this to 10 of your closest friends, then get depressed because you can only think of 4.

Remember.......A good friend will help you move.....a REALLY good friend will help you move a body........let me know if you ever need me to bring a shovel.

Friendship is like peeing your pants, everyone can see it, but only you can feel the true warmth."

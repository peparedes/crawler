If I had a waterproof camera, the top 5 things that I would want to photograph would be:

1) Underwater Rock Concert
2) Underwater/Under the pool (with a glass floor) Club Scene
3) The beautiful ocean floor and corals of the Philippine Beaches
4) A magnificent wakeboarding trick - First-person View
5) A lightning shot in the middle of a storm (perhaps with a couple on the foreground?)

Hahaha.

Imagine. These are the perfect locations wherein you can use this type of camera to it's full extent. Best advertising commercial ideas as well if you ask me.

Wouldn't you agree?

The results of your analysis say:

You plan ahead, and are interested in beauty, design, outward appearance, and symmetry. 
You are a shy, idealistic person who does not find it easy to have relationships, especially intimate ones. 
You are affectionate, passionate, expressive, and future-oriented. 
You are not very reserved, impatient, self-confident and fond of action. 
You enjoy life in your own way and do not depend on the opinions of others."

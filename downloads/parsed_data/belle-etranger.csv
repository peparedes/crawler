WHEN YOU GO AND SEND ME A FRIEND REQUEST, IT REMINDS ME THAT I WASTED A YEAR AND A HALF, WHICH IS HALF OF MY COLLEGE CAREER, IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.  I WOULD RATHER NOT BE REMINDED OF THAT. I OBVIOUSLY GO OUT OF MY WAY TO AVOID.  ARE YOU COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS TO THIS, OR ARE YOU ALL TOO AWARE AND ARE SEEING IF THIS WILL MAKE ME TALK TO YOU?  YOU HAVEN'T TRIED TO TALK TO ME, MUCH LESS TELL ME YOU ARE SORRY MY GRANDMOTHER PASSED AWAY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, OR SORRY FOR RUINING MY BIRTHDAY.  YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING TO BE MY FRIEND.  I TRIED TO MAKE YOU A BETTER PERSON. I WAS NOT HAPPY, AND I KEPT HOLDING OUT, CONVINCING MYSELF THAT THAT WAS JUST THE NATURE OF COLLEGE RELATIONSHIPS.  THAT MY HAPPY HIGH SCHOOL RELATIONSHIP COULD NEVER BE REPEATED WITH ANYONE BECAUSE WE WERE TOO YOUNG TO HAVE ANY REAL ISSUES, AND THAT COLLEGE RELATIONSHIPS WOULD NEVER BE SO BLISSFUL. BUT I NEED TO HOLD OUT FOR THAT. EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T HAPPY I STAYED WITH YOU BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS GOOD FOR YOU, AND MISTAKENINGLY THAT YOU WERE GOOD FOR ME.  I WAS WRONG, SO WRONG.  YOU OBTAIN SOME KEY QUALITIES THAT I DISLIKE IN A PERSON, AND LACK SOME KEY QUALITIES THAT I LIKE IN A PERSON, BUT I ALWAYS TRIED TO JUSTIFY.  DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE ANGER I FEEL TOWARDS YOU? I TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT YOU, BUT THEN I HAVE DREAMS ABOUT SCREAMING AT YOU, SAYING THAT I HATE YOU, AND EVEN HITTING YOU.  I CAN'T HANDLE LOOKING AT YOU. I ABANDONED ALL MY FRIENDS FOR THE PAST 2 YEARS TO AVOID YOU. I AM TERRIFIED OF SEEING YOU. I AM TERRIFIED THAT I WOULD BAWL. I AM TERRIFIED I WOULD SCREAM. I AM TERRIFIED I WOULD PANIC. I AM TERRIFIED THAT IT WOULD PUT ME INTO AN AWFUL MOOD THAT I COULD NEVER GET OUT OF. YOUR FRIEND REQUEST HAS ALREADY CAUSED A HUGE ISSUE. I WILL NOT ACCEPT YOUR FRIEND REQUEST BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT A FRIEND. I HAVE TO CONTINUE TO IGNORE YOU. WHEN I SEE YOU, I WILL HAVE TO RESTRAIN MYSELF FROM MAKING YOU FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT FOR FRIEND-REQUESTING ME.  I AM SURPRISED YOU EVEN DID THAT MUCH, I FIGURED YOU PRETTY MUCH FORGOT ME. YOU WERE ABSENT FOR ME WHEN I REALLY NEEDED YOU. YOU MISSED THE KEY SIGNS THAT I NEEDED YOU. I AM DONE WITH YOU AS A PERSON. JUST DONE. DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE. PLEASE LET ME DONE WITH YOU, AND NEVER TALK TO ME AGAIN."

He took single off his facebook, and I'm like I'm not your girlfriend and I'm not going to be soon, but I don't know how I should broach the subject with him.  I'm getting less and less sure of what I want as I think he's getting more and more sure.  He's not as perfect as I thought he was.  I saw him as the guy that was restoring my faith in some of the male population, but no, they are all dumb.  He was shocked that I have never cheated, nor come close to cheating on a boyfriend.  I don't take that as a good sign.  He's never ""cheated"" but he has had inappropriate behavior, which is still not good.  I don't know.  He asked me if I had plans for the weekend.  ""You're not seeing your other boyfriend are you?""  YOU ARE NOT MY BOYFRIEND. IF I WANT TO SEE ANOTHER BOY, I WILL.  There is no point in him not being my boyfriend if we're gonna be exclusive.  And I don't want him to be my boyfriend right now, so I guess we're not exclusive.  He is a great ego boost.  I asked him why he was intimidated by me... ""B/c you're smarter than me and can beat me up Rachel!"" says the 24-year old who has 8 inches on me and an engineering degree.  Hahahahahaha. I tell him to stop being a 15 year old girl all the time.  Don't get ""pouty"" b/c I wasn't being all kissy-kissy one morning.  Ugh. Well 8 minutes till class."

"event","Wow. I just went back and reread a bunch of my old LJ entries, like from 11th grade.  I had forgotten so much, and I also realized my neurlogical issues started way early as well.  In so many entries I was like ""I'm sad"" or ""I was sad, and then I got happy"" it's ridiculous.

I feel like I look to guys to distract me from my emotional problems, and to make me happy.  My emotions are completely tied to guys.  Most of my depression or happiness is triggered by guys.  That's good when I have a great guy, but it also puts a lot of pressure on the guy.  I can't handle break-ups like a regular person, I don't think.  In fact, I can't really handle them at all.  It's not so much a break up, it's seeing an ex with someone else, I just can't handle it emotionally.  It makes me scared to start something new.

But I have started (well re-started) something.  We've been talking on the phone every night, and e-mailing throughout the day.  You are a great person, like my dad.  It takes someone special to get compared to my dad.  There are no ""deal-breakers"" about you... you don't smoke, you drink in moderation, you are genuinely concerned with my well-being and find me irresistible :), you go to church every sunday when you're home, and you love your family.  not to mention you're super-smart and motivated, have already graduated, and have a good, stable job.  I'm ready to see where this goes.

I've been so unmotivated in school, but I think maybe it's my medicine.  I've also been distracted by a certain boy, but he gets excited for my good grades, so maybe that should be motivation.

I don't know. I'm such a hermit now.  We joke about me being afraid of the sun.  It's just me being afraid of seeing him really.  I almost had an anxiety attack at dinner tonight, b/c I kept feeling like he was going to walk in.  I need to get out of here, or something. I don't know.

I really want to go on vacation.  I'm excited to see Daniel Tosh with boytoy.  That will be fun.  He'll get to meet my parents (well he met my dad once, but just b/c he was helping move me in.)

I'm so crazy lol.

I'm ready to be done with school.  So ready."

"event","My grandparents sent my mom this poem after her mom passed away... 

I am Free
(Author By Linda Jo Jackson, Ottawa, Canada) 


Don't grieve for me, for now I'm free.
I'm following the path God has laid you see.
I took His hand when I heard Him call.
I turned my back and left it all. 

I could not stay another day,
To laugh, to love, to work or play.
Tasks left undone must stay that way.
I found that peace at the close of the day.

If my parting has left a void,
Then fill it with remembered joys.
A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss,
Oh yes, these things I too will miss.

Be not burdened with times of sorrow.
I wish you the sunshine of tomorrow.
My life's been full, I savored much,
Good friends, good times, a loved one's touch.

Perhaps my time seemed all too brief.
Don't lengthen it now with undue grief.
Lift up your hearts and peace to thee.
God wanted me now; He set me free!"

Together walking

About who we were
You held my hand so
Very tightly
And told me what we

There's nothing like you and i

We spent some time
Together drinking
Spent some time just thinking
About days of joy
As our hearts started
Beating faster
I recalled your laughter
From long ago

So why do I even try?
There's nothing like you and i


That's a song by the perishers. i love it. it was on greek but i forgot about it until john garrett played it in the car yesterday.

So i went to the doctor, and my mom asked me why i went to the doctor, and i told her not to worry about it bc i didn't want to tell her.  she goes ""do you want to get on the pill?""  hahahahahaha
yes mom, i want to get on the pill NOW. since i'm newly single, it would be a great time for me to get on the pill so i won't get pregnant from all the sex i'm planning on having. nothing like finishing off my college career being a skank.

but anyways...

I've gotten this urge in the past few weeks to rekindle all my high school friendships.  My first 2 years of college I tried to forget high school, but now I'm remembering the good stuff, and I miss it so much.  I miss Amanda and I miss Nicole, and I even miss Lauren, I just don't know I could be friends with her again.  I miss going to the football games every friday night with nicole.  i miss knowing there was always going to be something fun going on at amandas.  i miss all my old guy friends... cesar and brad :( i want to see everyone again.  we should have a 3 year high school reunion haha.

i'm really really glad we're friends again.  i don't know if you realize how comforting it is to talk to you.  there's not a whole lot of people i feel comfortable calling or talking to when i'm upset, but you can calm me down really easily, and i don't know think you realize how it important that's been for me these past couple of weeks.  so thank you.

ahhh boys are so confusing.  not really, i think i'm just confused about boys.

so yesterday i felt pretty loved.  i didn't leave my apt much b/c i was on the phone w/ different people for over 3 hours yesterday, but it was really good conversations.

well.....

i'll leave this on an unusually good note.

"event","Well, this has been an interesting past couple of weeks.

I don't even know who reads this anymore, besides Jill, and I tell her everything anyways, so I don't know the point in this, besides personal satisfaction I guess.

Well, we broke up, and I'm glad.  It needed to happen.  I'm not upset.  I'm sad that it couldn't work, and it took us a year and a half to figure that out.  But, I hope I had some sort of good influence in your life, and you saved me from being totally distraught freshman year i guess.  I don't want to say it was a waste of time, but I stayed in it longer than I should have.  I was reading my magazine over the summer, and an article was in there about how girls will stay in a relationship for a really long time just trying to make it work.  I almost couldn't read it bc I felt like it was screaming at me, like it was written just for me.  Hopefully, I'll be okay w/ it as the school year goes on.

I'm glad me and Jilly Billy are getting to see each other more.  She's one of my best friends, and she's the first person I want to talk to when I'm upset.  I can tell her anything, and she's ALWAYS there for me, and she always knows what to say to make me feel better.  I'm okay w/out a boyfriend when I have a friend like Jilly Billy.

I saw you the other week.  That was... interesting.  You seem to come across this every now and then, so I don't want to say too much.  I'll save that for a diary I'm thinking about starting.  But I hope we stay in touch :)

My grandma passed away.  I'm really sad for my mom.  It's weird to think about the fact I will never see her again.  I hope my mom doesn't go completely off the deep end.  I love my parents, and I hope they are around for a long, long time, and I don't lose anyone else I know.

My brother told me a true story he'd heard about.  I don't remember all the details, but I think this is correct.  This guy had some disease, maybe Leukemia, and it was gonna cost $100,000 for the surgery that would probably save his life.  He didn't have the money, and he just wanted to be put down.  He called himself the poster child for euthanasia.  Then he met a girl, and fell in love with her.  He wanted to live to be with her, and he began to try to raise the money.  Unfortunately, he soon died, but his whole outlook on life was changed.  Someone wrote a song about it, and a line from the song was ""Find what your soul can love the most, and give your whole heart to it.""  That really touched me, and I'm gonna try to do that.

Love,
Rachel"

I'm loving my intership, and now I have to think about if it's something I would like to do permanently.  The internship isn't exactly the actual job, so I really need to think about that.  I love the office I'm in, but I don't particularly love Macon.  So even if they offered me a job, which isn't necessarily likely since they currently only have 7 employees, I don't know I'd want to stay in or near Macon.  But they also have an Atlanta and Winston-Salem office.  So maybe if I really prove myself they could use me there.  Wake Forest has a really good grad school, and it's only 20 miles from the NC office.  So I'll apply there.

I'm considering:

Wake Forest
Mercer
Emory
UGA - maybe. I hate UGA, but they have a high ranked grad school.

I have to decide about other schools.

"event","Well... I'm drunk.  And I almost called.  I actually sent you a text asking if you had text messages now.  Obviously, you don't.  Ummm then I almost called, but I didn't.  Somet things are bothering me.  The main thing, I told you to be careful about what you said, but since I overanalyze everything, I guess it really doesn't matter.  You said you didn't know what my situation with guys was and that it was none of your business.  This was prompted by my latest post: my entire post before this was basically a compare/contrast of you and my current boyfriend.  You KNOW I have a boyfriend, (or you had to know at least the equivalent), but you pretend like you don't know.  That makes me think that you still care and it would bother you to think about me seriously dating someone.  There is no way you didn't know, if you actually read my last post.  Whatever.  It's so hard.  Haley visited this weekend, and she mentioned you, and for some reason she told me she you still care, and it really got to me.  I just don't get why everyone else has had this long-term on-again off-again thing, and I can't even handle talking to you.  Why didn't we turn out like EVERY other relationship?  Would I even want that?  Is it better than not having you at all?  I don't know.  You have the potential to cause me so much hurt, but I felt more satisfied with you than I could ever describe.  I don't even know if satisfied is the right word; I just felt right with you.  And when I think about how it used to be, this feeling of rightness just comes back up.  It makes me wonder, do you ever feel that way about me?  How could you not?  Who else is going to have the same for sure 100% no doubts about it this will never go away he is the one for me feelings about you?  Not to be insulting, but that doesn't just happen for everyone.  Not to say I don't care about him, but it's not the 100% no doubts about it.  I don't want someone who drinks all the time.  I want someone who wants me.  He knows the issues I have with him, it's just a matter of how much he cares about them.  I don't know why I feel the need to get so much out tonight.  I've just had all this locked inside for weeks.  And it's not that I hate or even dislike everyone from back home, it's actually the opposite.  I just can't handle talking to them.  It brings me back to when everything was okay, and then when it turned to such shit, and I felt so betrayed, and I felt so many things I never wanted to feel.  And it's so hard.  I want to be friends with everyone, and I don't want to have the bad feelings, but it's not something I can help.  It's so hard, and I've been so good, but lately the bad feelings have been coming back.  Little by little.  The other, for the first time in about a year, I had the really bad feelings again.  I hope they don't come back.  I've already written too much, and I can't write anymore.  Maybe later."

I don't know, I just don't know.  Do you ever wish you could just KNOW.  Why is it that I still think about you every day?  I've become a little bit number, yes, but still EVERY DAY.  Is that normal?  I don't really care, seeing as how I can't help.  I feel like every day is a battle to get over you. I feel like I need to talk to you SO BAD but I can't call you.  I would feel guilty.  I feel like I've developed you as this bad person in my mind, but I know you're the person I loved.  Why is that I when I was with you I wanted to scream I LOVE YOU as often as I could, but we barely say it?  I try to make excuses, like that's the difference between a high school relationship and college relationship, that you mature and things aren't that simple, but I feel like it really is just an excuse.  I want to know why I met you, why I had to have such grown-up feelings for you at such a young age if it wasn't going to work out.  Why is it that it always come back?  Why do I have dreams about you?  It's like it's not fair... it's been over a year since I last talked to you, and I try not to think about you, but then I have dreams about you.  I hate it, and I just want to be able to move on like everyone else.  I want to know how you are, I want to know if you still think about me.  Do you care about me?  Your family was my family, and I still hurt from the loss of that.  I hate her. I HATE HER. I feel like she ruined everything.  It still just doesn't feel right.  Why couldn't you have listened to me?  Why did you always treat me so great, but he cusses at me and smokes and blah blah blah and just make excuses for it.  I'm full of excuses for not wanting to get out of a relationship.  I still think we could have worked out.  I think I would still be happy with you if we hadn't broken up.  But I tell myself it's too far gone, and it could never be that way again.  But I think I just tell myself that to help me move on.  I want to tell you my good news, I want you to be happy and proud of me like always.  Or maybe I just want him to be you, or be like you.  I just need to talk to you, but I feel like I can't since I have him.  And don't get me wrong, I do care about him a lot, but I just don't know.  That's it... I don't know."

Well I feel like i keep picking the wrong one, or that i only have bad options to choose from.  i don't know why, i feel like nothing has turned out right, or the way i thought it would.

i feel like a bad person sometimes.  i feel like everyone hates me and i can't do anything to fix it, like no matter how i act i'm doomed for everyone to hate me.

i'm getting sad again, and i don't like it.  i just want everything to come together, and i hope it does soon.

i try to be optimistic about guys, b/c i seriously doubt i will NEVER find ANYONE, but sometimes it just feels hopeless. i feel like no guy would ever want to be w/ me for a length of time.  or at least not if i'm myself.  i want a guy that hates stealing, doesn't do drugs, is a christian, respects me a lot, is totally in love w/ me but has a life, understands everything about me and brings out the best of me. I just don't get it.

Jill, I love you so much.  You are the last person in the world that should have to go through anything like this, but you are so strong and I look up to for being there so much for your family.  You're an AMAZING person, and so many people are here for you."

i got an e-mail from my dad earlier. it said after everything he heard about vatech he just wanted to make sure i was okay. it made me want to cry, i don't know why. i feel bad for growing up and leaving my dad. i don't think my mom cares so much, but i know my dad misses me. jordan still lives at home, but he didn't spend time w/ my dad like i do. i feel bad for hating conyers so much.  i don't hate everyone and everything, but when i go back home i just get this awful feeling. i hate it. i don't go out b/c i'm scared i'm gonna see someone i don't wanna see. i was in conyers from kindergarten to my senior year, and now it turned out this bad? that most people i was so close to just don't care anymore? it makes me feel sick, and i just don't want to go back to it.

i'm so scared that one day, when i'm really REALLY into the relationship, you're just gonna decide you don't want a girlfriend.  i don't think i could handle being hurt like that again, so i've been guarded and it's hard to trust your feelings for me.  i didn't think i would second guess how you feel so much.  when we're together i'm sure, but when we're now i'm scared that you're not thinking good things.  maybe i just need time to trust your feelings.  if we make it through the summer, which i hope we do and i'm planning on, i will feel a lot better.

i feel like i unintentionally started a shit ton of drama that didn't need to be started. i'm sorry. i'm hoping that this time next week it will all be settled. i don't like everyone or anyone being so unhappy."

This is all bringing back so many memories.  I feel like senior year all over again.  It hurts.  It hurts that I feel like everyone, well not everyone, who used to be my good friend in Conyers just quit caring about me.  I can't go back this summer.  It's too many bad memories.  When I go back to Conyers, I have a hard enough time leaving my house b/c I'm afraid of who I'll see.  I can't have another summer like last summer.  If I can't move on, then I can move away.  That's all I did.  I'll never get over the break-up.  Not b/c of the romantic feelings, but to know that someone who used to care about me could suddenly care so little about my feelings.  I'll never get over how I was treated.  Just remembering how I felt, it's awful.  I'm doing better than I used to, but I still think about it a lot.  Two serious couples just broke up, and I hate it for them.  I don't know how to explain to them something that doesn't make sense.  Idk, some things about us weren't right, but I loved you, so I would never have broken up with you.  Maybe it was meant for you to break up w/ me to force me to someone who would be better for me.

"event","I feel like a lot has changed this break, but I don't know exactly what.  I feel like I am turning into a worse person, b/c I don't have anyone there who tells me not to do certain things... well at least not somewhere whose opinion matters enough to me.  I want a good influence again.  But if it's not there, it's not there.

As far as my reflections on 2006... easily the worst year of my life.  Hopefully, it will be the worst year of my life, as I don't know that I could handle a year much worse.  I just was not happy.  I spent the whole year with this indescribable heartache... over the whole year I just had this huge sense of loss, of losing something that meant so much to me, and no matter how hard I tried or how good I tried to be, I didn't deserve it.  But now everyone else gets it but me, even though I'm the one who wanted it the most and tried the hardest.  But I guess life just isn't logical.  Maybe I have something better in store.  I'm trying to have a positive outlook.  Today was a new day... I finally think things might start to get better, thanks to a handy doctor's visit.

I'll tell you what... Nothing could make you madder than feeling like you have this huge weight of emotion in you, just something so indescribable that you think it's crazy and strange, so weird that you don't even want to tell anyone how you feel because you don't want them to think you're not normal, but you finally get the courage to tell someone, and they don't really believe you, or believe it's anywhere close to the magnitude that you know it is.  It makes me want to punch something, and just shake her and tell her to understand. But oh well.

I really hope the medicine works... I hope it makes a world of difference.  I need it. I really, really do.

Nolan made me feel a lot better.  He explained that what I felt was a loss of friends, was me moving on.  I have a huge group of new friends.  I have a group of 20+ big brothers, and Jill.  That group has become a new family for me.  Jill is like my sister, and I love her so much.  And I've grown close to so many of the guys, and I know that they care about me.

I hope 2007 isn't just better. I hope 2007 is an amazing year.  I hope something happens in my love life.  I hope some possibilities, and maybe I'll actually try to make something happen.  Maybe I will be happen again.  maybe I will have someone who cares if I'm happy.  

I wish were able to have some form of actual friendship, but you don't seem to care about that all too much, so maybe it's time I just let you go.  I wish I didn't have to, b/c it hurts so much to think about every single moment that I wasn't just happy, but elated, because of how things were.  And sometimes I think they could be that way again, but I don't know that they could be.  I don't know whether I miss you, what we had, or how I felt.  I don't know whether I think you're the only one who could make me have those feelings, or if it's easier just to look to you instead of finding someone new.  It's the scariest thing in the world to think about letting you go, even though you moved on a long time ago, things didn't change much for me.  Thinking that I could love somebody else is a scary thought for me.  It makes me think that I can't trust my feelings, and that I especially can't trust someone else's.  And it makes me scared that being happy just isn't enough.  But I still have thoughts of being happily married one day, and those thoughts can't be pure fantasy, can they?  I could still find someone.  I just need to keep an open mind.

I should go read some more.  Reading always puts me in a fanatasizing sore of mood, and an optimistic one at that."

"event","Sometimes, or most of the time, I have this feeling of ultimate hopelessness.  I just don't know.  I feel like the future holds no happiness for me.  When I was younger, I just assumed that one day I would fall in love and he would love me back and we would get married and we would live happily ever after.  I just assumed that love kind of found everyone.  And when I was younger I used to talk about ""well my kids..."" or ""my husband..."", but now if that comes up I find myself wondering if that will ever happen.  I truly feel like I'm not going to get married.  I feel like love for me is hopeless.  I find something wrong with everyone except for people who don't want to date me.  I don't know, maybe I'm forcing a relationship to not happen for me.  I mean, how do you know it's right? You can say ""it feels right"", but then if the other person says that it's not, then where does that leave you?  With a perpetual feeling of loneliness.  I want a constant person who cares there, but more than a friend.  Now just someone to call a boyfriend, but a partner.  Someone who cares just as much about everything in your life as they do about theirs.  Where it's not my life anymore, it's ""our"" life.  I feel like I'm waiting for someone to make me happy, and I feel like each day I'm slowing realizing that that person just isn't there.  The only thing that remotely brings me that sense of happiness is my boys.  I love my boys, but I take everything they do so seriously.  Today 2 of them were jokingly ignoring me, and I thought they were serious.  I was trying to think of anything I could have done that made them upset.  I was so sad that I did something to make them upset.  Anything makes me sad.  I feel like everyone hates, and that nobody really cares about me.  I can't think of anyone where I'm their number 1 in life.  Somewhere where if I was gone, that it would make them feel like they lost a part of their life.  Nobody really knows how sad I get.  Whenever anything happens that puts me in a relatively decent mood, something else happens that ruins it for me.  And when I mean it gets ruined, I mean I go from a feeling of ""everything is alright"" to a feel of utter despair, that things will never get better.  I hate the feeling of things never getting better, because then it makes you feel like what's the point?  I've had over a year for things to better, and it's just gotten worse.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  Maybe there's nothing wrong with me, maybe there's just something wrong with life and I'm the only one who realized it.  I just want a break from feeling.  That's actually the advice that I've gotten.  I was at cocktail party this weekend, and at least 5 people told me I needed to smile.  Kerry told me that he's come to notice that all really smart people are depressed most of the time.  He told me that I think too much and I just need to get drunk.  Luke told me I just need to get drunk and not take anything seriously.  Maybe I should make that my new plan for life.  But then, yet again, what's the point?  I just hate it all.  I hate everything.  You name it, I hate it.  Except for crosswords.  I love my crosswords.  Maybe I'll just be a professional crossword-doer for the rest of my life and I'll be happy.

I think about Robert a lot.  I had a dream about him early this morning.  I dreamt that Kym, Haley and I were arguing about something stupid, and I saw Robert watching us on the couch.  I thought ""Wow, Robert knows how stupid it is to waste time fighting. He almost died and he knows not to waste time."" And then I said ""Robert, come here. I can't remember the last time I gave you a hug."" Then Kym and Haley looked at me and I realized I was the only one who saw him.  It's so weird that he's actually gone.  I am sorry for anyone that is having to suffer any pain from this.

It was your birthday yesterday, and I didn't even have to try not to call you.  I did not want to, and I wasn't even tempted.  I still can't believe you would stress your mom out, and then laugh about it.  You have some serious issues, and I want nothing to do with you.

I am ready for something really good to happen to me.  I just want a positive change.

I want to get out of this mood.

I think the weather may have gotten me sad, or at least triggered it.  There's a lot of different things that do it.

In high school, I was used to feeling smart, but my grades aren't making me feel that way here.  Maybe it's because I'm not putting in any effort.

Why is it that I love my house, but I hate Conyers? I go back home fairly often for different reasons, and I never call anyone to say that I'm in Conyers. Except Cesar.

You need to not talk to me ever again.  You do not know how to talk to me.  You know how to keep me on a string, and that is bullshit.  I don't even have to try to be the better person, you just make it turn out that way.  You're such a fucking liar, and you know nothing makes me madder than liars. Go fuck yourself.

I've made so many good friends out here, but I still find myself overanalyzing everything and assuming the worst.  I was picked sweetheart, and I still convince myself that nobody likes me.  I have problems for real.

I don't know what I want.  I don't know what would make me happy. But I need something. Something...

I miss Kym so freaking much...  I wish I spent more time with her during 11th and 12th grade.  I don't care if she's in SF, I don't feel like she's that far away.

I just want to go a party so I can feel happy and forget about everything that makes me sad.

Fuck it all.

I just want a hug. Even though I get 10 billion hugs a day, it doesn't ever seem like enough.

Maybe my job will help.

I hope something does.

I feel so sad when I think of Robert.  I just had to mention it; I think about him a lot.  Though we didn't hang out so much towards the end, I know what a great guy he was, and I can't fathom how Ruben, Allie, and every one of his friends must feel.  RIP."

this past week wasn't the best. car got hit, so i've been bumming rides. found out there's still mean people in the world that want to humilate others for no reason. got pink eye in both eyes. eyelids got infected with pink eye, and they were swollen and hurt and i looked ugly. i got an allergic reaction to something on the side of my face. which made me feel uglier. however, i did meet my roommate, and i got to see cartel live today. and i got a picture with will pugh. so i guess everything's not bad.

i still have so much left to say, and that pisses me off. i want to be through with thinking about it, so why i am i not?  i just want to get it out of my thoughts. is there a pill i can take for that? maybe i'll get in a bad accident and suffer amnesia. that would be amazing. or maybe i'll wake up and realize everything was a dream and that someone wouldn't really hurt me so bad and completely disregard my feelings and think i could handle it okay, because that's just ridiculous.

maybe things will get better. maybe i'll go to bed happy one of these days. probably not. but there's always maybe. which is sometimes good, and a lot of times bad.

i have really come to love lauren. and blair. i appreciate them in a new way for some reason, not to say that i didn't before, but it's a new way.

i can't figure out why i'm so reluctant to have any sort of relationship. i feel like i'm accomplishing something, but what? should i be proud that i can say that i don't kiss people and i don't see it happening anytime soon? i wasn't like the before. but now i naturally turn away from any sort of intimacy, like it's bad to kiss somebody. i don't get it. i just need new people in my life. i couldn't take it last night. i can't take it most nights, i just don't have anywhere to go. i'm hoping that once i'm gone everything will be okay again. even if it's not okay, i just don't want it to be like this. there's nothing that's so wrong that i feel like i deserve any sort of special attention, b/c my life isn't bad at all, i'm really luck actually, i'm just not happy. and i don't know how to be right now. i don't like that i have to distract myself from thinking all the time. that's why i read, so i'm not thinking. as much. maybe i should finish cleaning my room, b/c if my room's in order then my life will be too, right? and what good does being good in school get me? i couldn't do much better than i did, and everyone wants to know why i'm only at mercer, but i couldn't even get a full ride to mercer? so i don't know, i feel like i'm missing something that other people have. what could i have done better, or is it just something that's not possible for me? i don't know, i'm normally not one to think that anything isn't possible, i'm very optimistic. maybe when i'm done with feeling like this i'll be a grown-up? but i don't know. that's probably a long way off. i feel like i could be doing so much more, but then i feel like i'm doing enough. i don't know. i just feel so weird now. all the time. i'm going to read some more about heroin. ha.

"event","sometimes i feel like i just need to pour everything out. i don't like writing in a journal because i don't like to accidently come back across it. it doesn't bring back good feelings.  i'm tired of feeling like i can't allow myself to talk or think about anything to do with you. i've finally started cleaning out my room. it was weird when i got to where i keep all of my pictures... i found pics of you 10th grade, those made me nostalgic, i looked at those and missed how i used to feel back then... then i came across pictures from thanksgiving break, and it made me want to puke. i don't like you now. i want to reach into the 10th grade picture and pull out the guy that i used to know. the one that used to shave his forearms. the one that i used to make comb out the back of hair because of what the couch did to it. the one that i used to call everytime i got to your house because i was scared to knock. the one that i used to call a pansy. the one that walked up behind me while i was brushing my teeth and kissed my cheek. the one that would go out of his way to see me. the one who's lap i sat on out on the dock the first time you came over. the one that picked me up and kissed me in the hallway because we didn't get to see eachother that weekend. the one who still felt like our relationship was something special, and treated it that way. but that person is long gone. i don't want the person who misleads me. i don't want the person who made my stomach hurt because you couldn't be honest. i don't want the person that had total disregard for the way i felt every time i went to sleep, and every time i woke up, and every minute in between. i don't want someone who can't own up to anything, and makes me pry it all out. i shouldn't have to work for information that you know i need to know. i shouldn't have to work for honesty. i don't want someone who takes my everything for granted. i don't want someone who makes me cry, and is okay with that. i don't want someone who doesn't want me but refuses to let me go, because that again is a total disregard for my feelings. i don't want someone who wasn't sure that i was the best he could get, but won't admit that that was what it was about. i don't want someone who says one thing, and then does the exact opposite. that is the definition of a hypocrite. i don't want someone i can't trust, period. all i ever was was honest, and that's the least i could ask for, but the i wanted the most, but you are too much of a coward to admit anything that you know is half-way wrong. i don't want a coward. i don't want someone who knowingly does anything he is reluctant to admit to. i don't want someone who just takes me for granted, and assumes that because i am a good person that i will forgive them for making me feel a way no one should ever feel. it's indescribable really. sleep is no good when you get bad dreams about the situation, and you wake up and it's the first thing on your mind, or you go to sleep but you really can't because you're tossing and turning wondering what's going on and why you're the one going through this. or when you see a picture of you two in your parents room and it makes your insides turn out.  or that it's been 5 months, but it still feels like yesterday because you won't let it go. either let it go or don't. you keep hanging on by a thread. that isn't fair to me, but then again, that never mattered to you. only you matter to you, you don't want to seem like the asshole, you don't want to be inconvienced, you don't want to feel like you did anything wrong.. i don't want you. i wish i never knew the person you are now. it gives me a sick feeling. i wonder what i could have done to have helped you become a better person. you know that you've done wrong, and you know that you still are. just stop. you are acting like a complete jackass. i wish everyone knew everything, there's no way for anyone to understand where i'm coming from unless that knew every second of every conversation. you have handled this situation in the worst way possible, and unfortunately i'm the one suffering the consequences. i will end this with a mature and classic... FUCK YOU."

I just felt like thanking some of the people that have helped me get through these past couple months, whether they realized it or not.  Not that many of them will read this, but just because I'm not naming you now doesn't mean that you didn't, it just means I forgot as I was writing.

1. Jared Pepper and J.B. for always giving me hugs. Hugs may not seem like a big deal until you're not getting them anymore.  It's nice to know there are people you can count on to give you a hug everytime they see you. And a good one at that.

2. Nolan. For just being there. And talking. And making me feel important.

3. Cassidy and Samantha. You are good people, even if you're not the nicest at times, everyone should still know you're good people.  You were there for me from day 1. I can ALWAYS count on you guys. I'm glad I'm friends with you two.

4. Cammie. For being such a hardass, and always having something hardass to say. And not that I called you a lot, but just knowing that if I did, you would have been there, and known what to say.

5. Amanda. For caring.

6. Lauren. For always having my back no matter what. And always having something funny to say.

7. Kym, for letting me tell you anything.

8. Blair, for everything.  For being loyal. For making me feel loved and cared about.

9. Jess and Ms. Pam - For making me still feel like part of your life and that I actually mean something to you guys.

10. No name given - for giving me something to look forward to every other day.  haha. some of my friends know what I'm talking about.

11. Paige, because you leave nice comments. Ones that mean something.

12. Kyle A. - for letting me cry with you on the phone whenever I needed.  And always saying what you meant and trying to help me figure out what to do and really being a friend.

13. Dave Thomas - for talking. and trying to help, everytime I asked.

14. Lil Boner - for giving me a valentine. and being madly in love with me.

15. Erica - for being interested.

16. The baseball team - for changing with me on the bus. hahaha. that would make any girls day.

and that's all i feel like writing at this time.

i'm excited about this saturday."

i love lauren diane bagwell. no matter what she's always gonna be one of my best friends.

this weekend has been really busy but really fun.

i'm beyond ready to graduate. there's nothing left that makes me want to stay.

i'm feeling better about things, and that doesn't mean in a good way for you.  i mean that i'm getting a little bit of closure.  you're full of intentions, but it's not always the thought that counts.  i take a little bit of comfort in the fact that i know that i had the best of you, and at least i think i knew you in a way no one else will.  but now i've seen what is the worst of you. i least i hope it's the worst.  you've made your choices, and you just have to deal with the fact that you can't make everyone happy. i'm not sorry for anything, and i don't think there's anything you expect me to be sorry for.  i wish things could have ended on better terms, but i can't really say that it's my fault.

there's a lot of movies i've never seen that i need to.

i had a lot of fun last night.  good times, just regular fun.

i wanna play twister. and hoopla.

i miss amanda and nicole and cammie. everyone is too busy nowadays.

i gots to go to work.

i don't care

i haven't never felt so hurt and disappointed in my entire life.  but hey, look at the brightside i guess. it can't get any worse? actually it wouldn't surprise me if it did.  I wish there was some way to make anyone understand the way I have and do feel, but there is no way.  I can't keep talking about this, and I can't keep thinking about it, but I don't know how to make it stop.  I want to get it out of my mind.  I want to forget about everything.  I want it all to go away.  But it's not.  I want to hate you.  I don't wish this kind of feeling on anyone, no matter how much I don't like you.  I've never felt this way in my life, and I hope I never do again.  How can you do this?  I don't see how anyone could do this to anyone else.  It sucks to wake up thinking about all the bad things you've heard.  It sucks to feel sick to your stomach and to not be able to do anything to make it stop.  It sucks to feel like you can can't count on anyone.  It sucks to just want to crawl in bed all day and not come out until everything has gone away.  i can't wait to get away from everything. I still don't know how to move on.  I wish you could tell me something, anything, that would make it make sense.  I hate the fact I can't open the music on my computer anymore because I know what songs I'll play, and I know I'll end up bawling on my bed.  I hate having to change the radio all the time becuase a song comes on that makes me feel sick.  I hate that I let you become such a big part of my life, because I don't know how to get that back.  I want any part of this to make sense.  If it doesn't make sense, I can't get over it, I can just move on.  They say time heals all wounds, but I don't know who would have this much time.  I wish I could think about the bad memories to make myself feel better, but you know as much as I do that there weren't enough to even remember.  That's why it doesn't make sense.  I wish I never had to go through any of this.  I don't care if it ""makes me stronger"" because nobody should ever have to be this strong.  I hope never to have to be this strong again.  I wish there was anything I could do to forget, to turn back time, to make it all go away.  But I can't, so there's nothing I can do but wait for the stomach aches to go away and for the tears to stop for good and for the thoughts to turn to anything else for just a minute during the day."

I didn't really have to do much at school today... I think this school year will be fairly relaxing...
I don't feel all that much different, being a senior... I don't know... Like I don't feel like the rules apply to me, like I know we can't take food in the classroom, but I think I can, and I don't know I kinda feel like I can do whatever I want...

I feel confident ""academically"" this year, math and physics shouldn't be too bad... I already did most of my h/w... I'll see how Human Geography goes tomorrow... 

I'm not gonna be at school much, so I prob. won't see anyone that much, it'll probably take a lot of the weirdness out of graduating...

I really like my friends now... Not that I don't like everyone else, but I just enjoy the people I hang out with so much... they know who they are... I used to love hanging out with my old friends, but things just aren't the same anymore, I'm sure they feel the same way, but we sure had some fun memories...

Good luck to everyone on their Senior year!

"event","Well I'm feeling emo so I decided to write in my journal...

First and foremost, I would like to apologize to anyone that I've blown off this year.  It wasn't anything personal...

If this is to you you'll know it - 

1. I miss the way our friendship used to be.  I wish we could be friends like that again,but we can't have the same friendship if we're not the same people.  When Mr. Smith said that whole missing somebody before they leave thing, our friendship was what I kept thinking about... it's just not the same.  I'd still like us to be friends, but we need to talk or it's gonna turn into us talking bout eachother constantly... and we've had some really good times and I'll never forget them... I think back and remember times of us singing Usher after I stole $2 in change from my brother so we could get wendy's, and I feel like we're still the same we used to be... I'd like to think we could be friends like that again... but I don't know if it'd be that way... i guess i'll talk to you in person about it soon...

2.  It doesn't matter how long we go w/out hanging out, I still feel like we're as good as friends we used to be... we had some really good times too... I'll always be there for you... I feel like we've grown apart but whenever we're together it's the same as it used to be... I should have called you more this year to hang out, I was a bad friend to you... hopefully we'll start hanging out more again... i miss the fun we used to have...

hmmmm now random things to people, you might not realize this is about you...

you're a really good person and i'm glad we're friends, i love talking to you b/c you can always make me feel better...
i think you're a really good person and a really good friend and i value your friendship b/c not everyone is a good friend like you are...
it's weird b/c it's like i've forgotten you now, and you used to be such a big part of life, and in a way i think i could say i could care less if i had ever met you... you were a good learning experience but in the end just caused me a lot of pain...
i get so jealous of you... i wish i could be more like you in a lot of ways...
i like our friendship... we should hang out more (or at all)...



I'm really glad I have you... Even when I get stressed out I know I have you and it makes me feel better...

Whitney we should hang out sometime and lauren could be our seinfeld or something, you know the person who everyone else is friends with, and the other friends don't hang out unless seinfeld is around

Please comment... nice ones preferrably, but if you feel compelled to leave a mean one, go for it

i'm getting pretty burnt out... i don't know whether i want to be a slacker or not... i enjoy laying doing jackshit but then i feel like a bum later, but i can't ever bring myself to do my work

i wonder how things will be a year from now, when everyone's about to graduate, i mean things are so different from what they were a year ago, just imagine a year from, who's gonna be together, who's gonna be enemies, who's gonna be friends... and then it's all gonna go away w/ college

i'm ready for the summer

somebody take me shopping

i'm tired of being dissapointed (not to you) by everyone in general... people don't even realize they're disappointing me, and that makes it worse... my parents, my friends both

i think i might start trying to be friends w/ people again... by that i mean actually calling someone up and asking them to hang out, not just saying hey @ school... and anyone who wants to hang out w/ me just give me a call

sometimes i feel like a nerd... and i don't know if i am or not... in a way yes and in a way no, b/c i slack too much... i've been good about doing my work until after winter break... i just want to lay down and not have to get up until i feel like it

mr lester has been bothering me lately (no offense brad, and i doubt you read this anyways)

next year i think i might chill out some

i wish i didn't gossip and talk so much shit, but i can't help it, but oh well only a year left anyways...

i think at the end of the year everyone should write about how things changed during the 11th grade year... things changed soooooo much for everyone i think

movie tickets are $8!!!! that's crazy

i miss hanging out w/ lauren

i love you

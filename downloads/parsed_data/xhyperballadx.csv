"event","in a fit of rage (well, it was more like tidiness) i have deleted all my old journal entries, and i changed the colours. you like?

today my parents left for italy for 10 days. of course, i'm having a party. it's practically my right - they are leaving my sister and i alone in the house, after all, it's only fair that i repay their kindness by inviting 20+ drunken 17/18 year olds over. plus, i'm doing all their random jobs like watering plants and doing the wash and so on, i'll need a bit of respite by the end of the week...

have just realised that im working 9-4 on results day. schiesse. and none of the other casuals have emailed me back yet, saying 'why of course i will cover your shift, in fact, let me do all of your shifts, you go out and enjoy yourself'... i live in hope.

made Tom W a twee indie/post-rock cd. now i need a suitably indie name for it! i'm thinking <i>Cellar Door</i>, or <i>Of Mixtapes and Melodies</i>, but none of them seem quite right. help!

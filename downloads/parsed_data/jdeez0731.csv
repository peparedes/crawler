"event","It's always an eye opener when you think you're an okay person...you go out of your way to help...and then in reality, someone tells you that your a sacastic mean bitch.  Someone sent me a great email the other day...here it is. 

NAIL IN THE FENCE
 

Make sure you read all the way down to the
last sentence.
 
(Most importantly the last sentence.)
 

There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His Father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the back of the fence. The first day the boy had
driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks, as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to
drive those nails into the fence.
 
Finally the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He told his father
about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that
he was able to hold his temper.
 
The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said, ""You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one. You can put a knife in a man and draw it out.
 
It won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there. "" A verbal wound is as bad as a physical one.
 
Friends are very rare jewels, indeed. They make you smile and encourage you to succeed.
They lend an ear, they share words of praise and they always want to open their hearts to
us."" 

It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends! how much you care. Send this to
everyone you consider a FRIEND, even if it means sending it back to the person who
sent it to you. If it comes back to you, then you'll know you have a circle of friends.
 
YOU ARE MY FRIEND AND I AM HONORED!

I read that and it stunned me.  I realized that a lot of time I get angry, I do say mean things...so I wanted to change.  I took care in saying how I felt calmly...not getting angry.  What did that get me??  It got me...""why are you so selfish, why are you trying to lay a guilt trip on me""  I was also told that if I left...the door was open.  I feel my heart was ripped out...this whole not getting angry and speaking feelings bullshit has torn me open.  I was told to get some friends...when in my eyes I feel I sacraficed all my friends to be here...why should I have to find more....

I remember other times I was left crying room...with the sounds of video games in the background.  It's a shot in the face...or in other words...a nail in the back only to leave a wound."

But before I close the chapter of Claire's in my life...I have my last customer stupid question....

A lady comes to the cashwrap, puts her stuff down to buy and says....""Do you mind ringing this all up before I pay?""

Um...come again?  No mam here at Claire's I can add all this up, add tax and get your money BEFORE I ring it up.  You fucking dumb piece of shit.

Welp..2005 is here.  New apartment and a new job, it's about fuckin time!"

He goes to sign the lease tonight and we can start movin our stuff in.  I've been sayin for a while that I have two hells, work and this room....and now we'll have a new apartment, and I'm slowly workin on that other problem.  I have a job interview on Wednesday EVERYONE KEEP THEIR FINGERS CROSSED FOR ME!  I cannot take Claire's another second!

I hope everyone has a great holiday.  I'm looking forward to the time off and it being over.  I've only done a little bit of shopping with the little time I have.  I haven't even gotten my cards in the mail yet!  I have to find some time to do that crap or I'll be sending belated Christmas cards.

What's everyone doing for New Years?  Tack and I were orignally going to spend the night at a casino near here, but they were all booked up.  Then he had the idea of driving to Chicago and spending the night.  But now that we have a new apartment with actual space, we think we'll stay home and safe and invite some people over.  Should be fun...I've had some interesting New Years....lol..

Anyway I'm off...figured I'd write something in this thing.  peace"

<P>Hmmmmm do I have to buy it?</P>
<P>NO YOU DUMB PIECE OF SHIT YOU DO NOT! BUT YOU MAY WANT TO GO PURCHASE A HEARING AID!!!!!!!!!</P>
<P>Anyway, I hope everyones Thanksgiving filled you to the brim.&nbsp; Tack and I went for the gander and made our own!&nbsp; Oh yes fellow people I cooked.&nbsp; We documented the whole fiasco with pictures.&nbsp; And everyone has to know...oh yes my lovely boyfriend made ME...yes ME stick my hand in that thing and pull out the neck, which mind you looked like a crooked penis!&nbsp; Lovely...here is the pic as I'm telling myself over and over ""not a big deal, this is not a big deal""&nbsp; I then pulled it out quickly and threw it into the sink!</P>

"event","As I knew I would be, I am absolutely terrible at updating this.  I think everyone feels that there aren't enough minutes in the day, I feel that way all the time.  My two days off fly by and I feel as if I've done nothing.  I'm at work constantly.  Finally, a week from tomorrow I return to Connecticut.  I haven't been home for a year now.  It's long past due.  I wish it could be longer then 4 days, but I'll take whatever I can get, especially around the holidays working in retail. 

As soon as I go to write in this damn thing, I realize what a totally boring life I lead.  I have absolutely nothing to put in here.  All I know is FBI is on a mission for me...and when shes completes this mission I'll be one happy lady!  FBI IS MY HERO!  If anyone only knew....

I need to do something...I feel as though I'm living each day the same and just don't going anywhere.  I'm sitting here playing video games like I did when I was in high school?  Did I graduate?  Did I go to college?  Did I then graduate college?  Has all this time gone by and I'm still sitting in front of this computer!?  At least I can say this...I don't eat McDonalds anymore, and I go to the gym...both things I thought I'd never say.  Thanks babycakes!

Well enough boring you people...I do have one last statement...

I hate phone tag....especially with people I really want to talk to....."

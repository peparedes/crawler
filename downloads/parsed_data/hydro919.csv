Who said we need to figure out the question and answer to solve the universe though? We have just a limited amount of time so we are kids, we go to school, we get jobs, families, and so on and so on. Its a linear path we take more on our shoulders then we should at times. Someone that wants to solve world hunger, global warming, obtain world peace. At the equator the Earth is 250,000 miles around. That is just to far for just one human.

Just one moment in our lives create a chain of events. Helping some one pick up something, taking the time to just wait and throw that piece of garbage away, doing the right thing, again the list is endless. But it defines you and who you've effect. Of course the same rules imply to the bad choices you make. Normally those are the ones that people see in your life. So its hard to change certain things about the bad things... But you can again take those few seconds to prove them wrong set another chain of events in to the world. <br /> <br /> The few seconds are either something you can control or you can't you have no way of knowing what will happen. <br /> Uncontrollable- You were in a car accident that wasn't yout fault, you couldn't prevent it but you are still here and you could have had alot worse happen. <br /> Controllable- You hold that door opened for the person behind you. (you've probably seen the commercial for some insurance company, or seen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">""Pay it Foward""</span>) But then they do something right and so on. <br /> <br /> When you look at life you normally break it down in to time. You are friends in high school but then drift apart for the most part. You date someone and then break up. You can pin point those events. But look back and you'll notice that if this didn't happen then this couldn't happen. Everything, EVERYTHING happens for a reason. It doesn't have to be a good reason but in the end you'll have learned something and you'll realize that you could be for the better. <br /> <br /> My few seconds, my chain of events I think started in 4th grade. Yeah life went on before then but 4th grade is where I can pin point it.&nbsp; Where did your few seconds happen? Maybe they haven't yet? Maybe your life has been lineary. But remember everysecond cause when you look back at your life you'll want to know when you few seconds happened.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (And no I didn't just see a insurance commercial or finished watching <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Pay it Foward</span> actually I never watched the whole thing)<br /> </span>"

"event","Too long I have parted you my live journal....... Well in reality Only Mallory and Meimi read this so, this is all for you girls!!

Hmm Well good things have happened. Shortly after the last journal I let her go. I'm pretty much free of her. I say pretty much because after all the shit she did I'll still be there if she needs me........ and thats pushing it, like if she got shot or something..... ok not that extreme but you catch my drift to its point. That lifts such a burden on my shoulders and my heart. I knew that I had given it the best try i could give and it wasn't enough for her..... SO what?! That just means she doesn't deserve it. I'm sure you are all pretty happy about that, (even though you probably already knew; but the rest of the internet didn't) equally I'm happy about it too. It opened my eyes to better things. Like.... being happy.&nbsp; Apparently my family didn't think to highly of her. They say I've been more talkitive... guess I never noticed. And I saw that my friends well.... lets just say I see a lot from the other side of the fence. And spending the summer together.... well it was harsh but it worked and we all still love each other.... at least the better love each other or I'll rip out their insides and send them to the other family..... yeah!!!!! 

Oh a few things at work, I'm a Supervisor now..... not that it means much I still get kicked around like a bitch at times. But I have a small amount of power now.... and power is good. I just need to get my minions on the right track. Hmm yeah not too much at work really. Lost a lot of good friends. My English is out in Albany for school I miss him very much he was my number two at circuit, but happily we keep in touch. And its kinda his fault the Saturn died.... Ok not really the water pump broke and over heated the engine. Karla is gone finally, after talking about it for so long she left and is happily employed at an insurance place, she came back for a bit but knew she couldn't do it. And Asmira left awhile ago but she is doing good at school and stuff and I'll always be in touch with my favorite Bosnian. 

Hmmm now for something meaningful like I normally do.............................................................................. You need to excuse me work has slowly dragged the meaninfulness of me out. I guess I can go off on that.&nbsp; Nope I thought about it and it doesn't work. 

Fun lil tid bit, almost everyone I know&nbsp; is now&nbsp; a Mii..... If you think I might have forgotten you then you should let me know. I'll Mii you up and beat you so badly in many many Wii Sport games. 

This is not the job I want for the rest of my life and I'm going to change that too. For some people this is what they want. But not for me. I really do wish for more out of my likfe"

"event","How can one person define who they are? Are you not able to know how much of an impact you have been on this planet until you die? Or is it just by how you treat everything around you? There are people that make an impact right away be that with money or touching someone in life. But do big accomplishments measure to the same as the little ones? I mean you could donate a million dollars to some charity, or you could save a life and you weren't trained to do it you just saw the person and know it was the right thing to do..... 

Deep enough for ya? Guess I've been thinking on who I am lately. I had my senior yearbook out and reading through some of the things people wrote. Its the last some people ever know from that person. I'm upset with myself. I had a lot of friends in high school. But I don't have anything from them. But turn it around and I have a few things from people that I don't talk to much anymore and they really touched me... I know I had some good friends and I hope i was just as good of a friend to them as they were to me. Looking at the group shot I saw my best friends that i stood by in it, but also saw my old best friends in the back..... I thought to myself I should have stood by them in the picture... That could have been my last time to actually be with them forever.... (in a book) I still have a best friend from high school and I really know what a friend is by him being there for me and myself being there for him.

So question for you all. Does who you hang out define who you are to some extent? I think yes. after being around friends for so long you take a part of them in to yourself, and they you. So by the end of your life you will be everyone you've ever befriended. You pick up mannerisms, voices,&nbsp; actions, habits. I know from personal experience that I take bits and pieces from my friends and use them. I've caught myself talking like Meimi, acting like Chris, thinking like Lys. Its not a bad thing I'm still myself but I'm them as well. Its strange when you think about it because no matter how hard we as humans try to be individuals we are doing something everyone else has does it. You can say just be yourself but you are going to be yourself no matter what. 

Yeah I've been thinking a lot about being your own person a little bit because of whats happened to me in the recent months. Is she being her own person? Or is she taking in what everyone around her is telling her to do? I know she's a big girl and she can make up her own mind. But what if she doesn't know what she wants? I know what I want but not at the expense of making her upset. No matter what she'll always be on my mind. I'll always have a part of her like I do the rest of my friends. I took a lot out of that relationship. Most important thing i was able to learn was what love is. I did tell someone I loved them before I had met her. But in reality It wasn't pure true love. Not what I had with her.&nbsp; Like I said before, things in life change in a instant and you have to either take them in stride or let them take you down. I took the latter of the two. I'm working on it though. Different things all the time remind me of. Its hard to look at my friends and not remember the first time we all shared together or little things in my life that have a connection to her. Yeah some of you had said that I should get rid of anything that reminds me of her..... So you want me to live in a box in like Los Angeles? Yeah thats an extreme but it makes you see the connections i have to everything around me that are to her.&nbsp; I hope in someway I've been able to touch her, been able to make her think differently, look at life in a different way.....&nbsp; Guess I won't know now. But still I have hope. All love is a mystery it moves in and out not stopping or waiting. But thats why we are able to love. We are able to wait and love will come back maybe not how you wanted it to. But it does."

"event","So the title says it. Well it lies to you actually don't listen to it.. Its been more like a year and and three months... So..... yeah alot has happened. Alot of good though. But with any good you get the bad still... And the bad normally sticks out like the blue man group in a colony of albinos. <br /><br />Things change so fast. One second you are just standing proud and you are ready for everything that could possibly come at you. And then someone comes right behind you and swings a bat at your knee caps. A very harsh visualization but its pretty true. The world can take you on so many spins that it's never one of those rides that you say lets do it again! So I sound depressed I take it? Yeah.... We should get this out now then. Awhile back I messed up royaly. Like the worst thing, I hurt the only person I wanted in my life forever, and that hurt me alot too. I know what I did was wrong and if you believe me I would take it back every word every second every touch if I could I would take it all back. But time isn't cyclical.... It keeps going on and you don't have any choice when you can stop and take a breather. So we tried. And things got better. I thought things looked pretty bright and they would never stray from the path we were making. But she wanted to try other things. She's young I understand that, so I let her go. I wanted her to be happy. We promised we would still talk and stay close. But she liked him now. She wanted to see where things could be taken with him. So she then let me go. She stood infront of me as he swung the bat at my knees. When I landed on the ground she wasn't there infront of me this time. So now I'm fixing myself and I know everyone is against me on this even her maybe but I'm staying around. Many people are mad at me. They say I'm in denial, or I'm weak and I need to give it up already. <br /><br />Love doesn't work that way. You can't just throw it up in the air and walk away hoping it won't hit you in the head again. Love takes ahold of your heart and embraces it. It makes your feel all your emotions at their peak. Which is dangerous... pain, sadness, lonelyness... They go hand in hand with love. If you have ever been in love then you know what the heart can do to you. I will make you feel impervious to all bad things. But in the back of your heart there is a part where love doesn't wrap all around. Its that part where bad things can creep out and take hold of the weakest chain in love and break it making it that much weaker. It puts some doubt in to you. But Love is a splendid thing.... It can with stand the hardest of blows. If it has to it will keep you alive so that you stay around to love. <em>yeah redundent I guess....</em>&nbsp; So I still love her. No matter what happens I will always love her. Yeah you can say well of course you are going to love her still. But no I love her more then the forever type. I found the one I want to be with. And love will prevail. Its the only thing you can believe in now-a-days.<br /><br />Honor.... one of the most lost arts to men in these times. Honor defined my the dictionary is, honesty, fairness, or integrity in one's beliefs, high respect. I've always thought I had honor for other people. I've always respected people to a high degree. I may have had my bumpsin the road but I'm sorry I'm human. But if you go after someone's girlfriend agressively then you shouldn't be given a chance.... You will always think of yourself and you will never be able to put the other first.&nbsp; And honor is for people that can put themselves before others. Even at a time like this I would push him out of the way of a moving car so she could be happy with him no matter the outcome of my own self.......<br /><br /><br /><br />Ok thats enough for now......... we aren't together now. but that doesn't mean we won't be together forever.......<br /><br />Hope...... Its the best light anyone can hold in their hands."

"event","<P>So before I get too far in to this entry I would like to tell you all whats going on. I had my second english class today of this semester. We were going over homework and other things on the syllabus and we came to journal entries. Our teacher mentioned blogging our journals. This was a marvelous idea I thought since now have a reason to update this journal and I can normally type better then I can write. So that is the breif introduction in to the reason why the titles lok like so. Each time I'm doing a journal entry I'll place English 101 Journal Entry, so if you want to skip it be m guess but I would enjoy some criticing on the writing seeing as this is a Composition class (Mal help out as much as you want please!)</P>

While having some free time on campus I've discovered that their are a plethera of computer labs. Some might be just used for certain classes manily focused towards computers. But for the ones opened to us all are the more usable and beneficial. For the most part classes either use the computer lab in the Library which i prefer; makes them seem less sterile then a pearly white computer lab in the IT building. Something about the books just makes a peacefull setting. The computer in the library are in two sections, the Computer Lab and the Work Station. The Work Station computers are located in the media side of the library. While you aren't allowed to access the Internet on these computers it actually diverts you away from the distractions of the Net. These computers are fully equipped with word processors which will help out alot when you have long breaks in between classes or just needing to get some quick work done between classes. Now the Computer Lab you can word process, surf the net you have a whole armada of technology at yout fingertips.
Its very helpful having computers at our disposal since amny teachers are now intergrating computers in class. Much like my English class and this journal!"

"event","<P>Ok so, Again this is just like me to just ramble on and on about how I haven't updated in awhile and how I'll try to get more updated. Well I won't do that I'll just ramble on and on, on rambling. Ok lets see its been like 4 months since I last updated.... Wow I'm a slacker!! </P>
<P>So after Myrtle beach I got a new job at Circuit City. Finally something I actually know about! But in reality I'm only really knowledgeable about games. But that didn't stop me. There are some very intresting people there. But I'll get back to them in a moment. So a few weeks before that I went to the last prom of my life. You all might be wondering, ""Didn't he graduate like 3 years ago?"" Yes my friends I did, but now that I'm dating the ever lovely Katie I decided to dawn the tux one last time and show her a good time. Her mother made her dress which she fit in to perfectly and it looked gorgeous on her. It was pink and the guy is suppose to match the girl. So I picked out a black tux with a pink vest and tie. I think&nbsp;I pulled it off very well actually. So we did her grand march which was a <EM>hell </EM>of alot different then Westmoreland, see in Westmoreland we walk down once. But there in Sauquiot Valley they do it like four times. I was getting a lil tired lol! But with that other with we headed down to ummmm ok the name escapes me at the moment but its the place next to tony's in washington mills. It was nice looking in there. We found her friends and set our stuff down there, so we could get pictures outta the way right then and there. So did that when we actually got back to the table where our stuff was her friends let someone else sit in our spot. Pretty shitty huh?!&nbsp; She got pretty upset with the ordeal which was totally understandable but luckily we found some other friends of her's which were nice to let us with with them. So after that the night picked up we danced, now alot of you know me and know I don't dance so it was pretty hard to get two people up there that don't really dance. But we pulled through and had an awesome night. I even got to spend the night there which was pretty nice. Seeing as we got back to her house at like 4? So lets jump around a few months and we come to her graduation party very fun times got to meet all ov her family. I had meet most of them in myrtle so it was ok but her aunt that they all siad was crazy..... well she kinda is. not to be mean but she is over dramatic....... again we jump around and we land on a lil outting to enchanted forest. Normally&nbsp;i'd go with my family but that couldn't happen due to work. Oh yeah work., so the people there are nice... for the most part not like my last lil crew but still really fun people. The people that stick out most are Karla Warren and Jenn. Karla works in computers and i was able to hit it off very nnicely with her she is a very funny person someone you'd want to get to be friends with right away. Warren is an over all sarcatic bastard! but in a totally good way. He always has some very intresting stories and you would think that He would stop pulling my name tag off after like 3 1/2 months. Then there is Jenn very nice girl, girlfriend to Warren, she is always in a good mood when you talk to her unless something is really bothering her then either stay outta her way to try to help. (hope she is reading that book i gave her) So a few weeks ago the gang got together for one last group outting. :,( cause well Chris is leaving on his Annual Baldwin Family Trip around the US. I think the only place they haven't been is Hawaii and Alaska. And Meimi is now in NYC instead of CNY. We all miss her like crazy but its only like a 2-3 hour train ride so it would be fun to spend the day with her or something. And me and Lys are going to school together actually tomorrow! So the outing, we went to Green Lakes. It was so nice out there the lake was actually green! ok like a pale green but still it wasn't brown like Sylvan beach. It was deep too there are these swimming lanes that go down to like 19 feet deep i tried to touch the but was with no avail.&nbsp; After the water we went to take a walk around the lake. We stopped for lunch at this great Italian place, yummy<EM> I Love Chicken Alfredo. </EM>So then it was back home where Chris had to go to work. So now you are all pretty much caught up........ Oh yeah its also almost my birthday 21st of be exact.</P>

So it all started last wed. night when Katie left to go to her senior trip. She was off to Virginia Beach. Its ok we got to talk everynight and I texted her all the time, today she didn't text me back as much, but I knew she was busy. So those were 3 long days with out my sweetheart. I almost went nutz!! I wrote her notes while she was gone so it would be like I was.... kinda there, yeah weird I know I am.
So on Sunday morning I picked her up at Kings Dominion. Cool place wish I didn't have to pay 8 bucks just to pick her up. But it was worth it to hold her and kiss her again. So we sat in the back holdin' each other the whole 6 hours! So we got there ate chicken and I meet her family. They seemed really nice. Just as she described them to me. Her Aunt Jill was really nice and friendly, I met most of them already before. So for the most time we spent time on the beach and it was awesome laying there with my girl. OH I went boogie boarding. It was fun and fast and well i swallowed alto of salt water which tastes alot more worse when i don't mean too. Hmmmm oh i bought Fireworks! yeah the box was awesome! boom boom flash yah!!!!WE went to a shibby cool mini golf place (which katie calls putt putt isn't that cute). But me and katie got some good one on one time. OH and this was some random family time watching two ducks go at it..... yeah you heard me. Katie lost her ring that day on the beach but thanks to my ""connections"" *cough Family Store* I'll just get her a better one.
I think Chris and Lori mighta been a lil mad when i woke them up, but come on we are on vacation wouldn't you wanna get the most outta it? But we all had alot of fun for the most part I had a really good time. Yeah there were a few hiccups in the whole thing but thats life right? Well I guess i'm just living life then. All and all it was a good trip. Katie and I are closer then we ever have been. So no matter what....nothings gonna stop us now. (does anyone remember that cats don't sing movie i liked that movie........ ok well yeah) 
BYE!!!"

So lets see by the looks of it I haven't updated since new years...... well even though not much happens in my life, things do happen, nothing always intresting and journal worthy but things happen oviously.</P>
<P>Well things with Katie and I are still really good. Shall be the big half a year this April 12th. That is one day before she leaves to go on her Senior Trip :(. Its ok kinda we've already had a weekend apart, but damn do I hate spending time apart. I dunno how Mallory and Bill do it. She was only away from me for one weekend and I missed her like crazy. But when she got back I gave her a big hug! Hugs always feel alot better when you haven't seen the person. So yeah she will be leaving the 13th at like 10 pm going down to Virgina Beach, I won't beable to see her until hmmm that Sunday morning when I get to pick her up to go to the Myrtle Beach Family Trip! Well I can tell you I'll definatly beable to update after that trip! I mean a road trip with Chris and Lori you can get a good fell of adventure off of that! So we will all be staying in a hotel room Saturday night, and picking Katie up and taking her back to the room to get a lil more sleep and then back on our way! Hmmm I'm thinking we could leave home at about....I dunno 4 or 5 in the morning. Hmmmm yeah then&nbsp;I get to meet the family, spend some time on the beach, just hang out and relax. But Wednesday I have to leave. So thats like 4 flippin' days with out her. But just a month after that is her Prom! And even thougth she think I'm not, I'm overly excited to go with her! Its been awhile since I got to be all dressed up and look snazy! And its an important day for her so I wanna beable to spend it with her.</P>
<P>Oh another Katie related topic was that Ashley her little sister threw her a surprise birthday party. It was alot of fun. Some friends from work came, and most of her girlfriends came. I learned that they actually like me which is a cool thing since her guy friends other then Greg; which he still calls me Jeff...... yeah.......; they hate me. Yes its possbily due to the fact that they are all friends of Brian and they still think I stole her away from him.... But yeah i got to talk to Jenn and Justine and Steph. Well Kari from work though it would be a good idea to bring some Bacardi to the party (no not my dog). the only one that drank it was Katie, and well this was Katie's first time getting a lil tippsy and well she was........ curious about everything. So Kari promised to not get Katie smashed with ummm distractions around. </P>
<P>So lets see what else happened....... well there was St. Patrick's Day and my cousin Patrick came over and guess who got to be the lucky driver! Come on now guess... no really guess.. oh ok YES IT WAS ME! So yeah WE ate Irish food and then Katie and I retreated to my bedroom where we watched movies for the big chunk of the night. And well yeah like normal my sweet-looking girlfriend rested on me and fell asleep. But then we had to wake up and drive my drunken Cousin home and he was Drunk! He had his hands on my head and I did my best. Yeah I'm just glad I don't drink and so is Katie.</P>
<P>Hmmmmm there is probably more...... ok other then I was fired... yeah I was you wanna hear more well them talk to me.</P>
<P>So moving on. Yeah actually there isn't much more...... I did tell you all I got a new car? Well if I didn't I did. Smashed up the old Ford pretty bad. So&nbsp;I had to go out and buy a new car well its not new but its a 2001 Saturn L300 white with leather heated seats and a sun roof and ummmm yeah its cool! and mine witha&nbsp; cd player that works! ok&nbsp;now&nbsp;thats it! oh yeah only more fun fact</P>
<P>Katie's dad said we can get married weird huh?! Well I mgiht have to take him up on that lol. I Love You Katie!</P>
<P>The Dorky Mood is for Katie</P>

"event","So this is a lil bit more updated then last right?! Well New year Eve was last night and it consisted of alot of driving. SO I went to Katie's christmas. I felt bad for missing the last one and even worse how he dad wouildn't let her come to mine. (we aren't gonna put all the feelings on here of course though) Brian called a few mins. after we got to her aunt's saying he was bored and had nothing to do. Well sorry bucko she is kinda with me tonight. So yeah we hung out there ate some food, I actually ate some broccoli stuff it was pretty good.  They opened presents before dinner. So we watched some of shrek 2 then had to go to lys' party. Chris was leaving his house a few mins before we left i found out. And we were able to follow him the whole way there. he said he was driving slow so i could catch up but we all know its just how he drives. when we got there it was.... hmmm yeah alot like our parties. (hope you know what that means) chris played some songs at lys' request and then he left me and katie left shortly. So we then headed down to my house and watched the ball drop kissed drank ginger ale hey it looks like the real stuff lol. then i took her home right at 1 so she just made it. so i went home checked if she was one real quick and she wasn't so i went to bed. and then she calls me this morning and tells me she has to go to work. Ya see Jen (stupid whore from work that wants to be laid off and i wish she did cause then chris or amy wouldn't have to leave) yeah she called in so katie had to wake up and go to work. oh well she wanted to stay outta the house today so brian can't give her any surprise visits since she told me he sent her a lil email about how he still likes her. I don't blame the guy she is an awesome person and hot to boot. But i'm not going anywhere anytime soon so yeah he can like her all he wants but i'm not gonna step aside. at one point i thought i should cause well the age thing and how none of her friends like me other then steph. oh well that past cause i'm not letting her go. ok that sounds like i'm holding her against her will but i mean i love her so yeah thats what i mean.....Oh well i'm seeing if she wants to do anything tonight with chris and lori hopefully we can all meet up ok i've said enough bye"

"event","Well I went to Katie's Semi-formal last night. I got to her house around 6 and we started to make riggies. Her family watched us made jokes but I'm really getting used to them. At first I was nervous. Then she hit her aunts van accidently nothing serious just a lil paint. So she was freaking out and I got the be the calm one. So at first well two days ago Brian her ex didn't plan on going then the day before he is going and we have to pick him up. That was ok, I was ok with him at first. Then we got to the dance and walked around a bit Katie was still a lil frazzled. So ok the music wasn't all that good. They did play a techno song which I liked but it was an old over played one good but yeah its the one everybody and their grandma have heard. So yeah around 9:30 her friends show up ""The Guys"" and we go say hi...... Can ya wonder how that turned out? Yeah shitty! They totally acted as if I wasn't there. Yeah I've never had anyone hate me before they knew me. They can hate me after they know be but even before Hi?! Whats with that shit?! So I was a lil bummed and Katie was too. And well a few more slow dances and we left. Oh yeah before I even said it was ok if Katie wanted to give Brian one slow dance. So at that time I needed some friendship booster. Yeah gettin a lil kiss from katie every here and there was good. I had fun and I didn't at the same time. But I mostly feel bad that they kinda ruined the dance for Katie. Oh well.... lol I have enough friends for the moment. I just hope Katie is ok.... Well yeah that was my night.. 
oh yeah then we went back a lil early like half hour early and ate the riggies, I think we got the wrong noodles but it was ok it still tasted ok next time it might need more spice. So then we watched Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Its a really good movie. And yeah we did make out lol! What can I say my sweetie is a good kisser. So yeah that definatly made up for the night."

"event","Found this on someone journal. This is the most messed up thing ever!


This was an actual letter sent out by the St. Mary's 
Church. 

If Your Child is a Gothic, Reform Through the Lord! 

Listed below are some warning signs to indicate if your 
child may 
have 
gone astray from the Lord. 

Gothic (or goth) is a very obscure and often dangerous 
culture that 
young teenagers are prone to participating in. The gothic 
culture 
leads 
young, susceptible minds into an imagined world of evil, 
darkness, 
and 
violence. Please seek immediate attention through 
counselling, 
prayer, 
and parental guidance to rid your child of Satan's 
temptations if 
five 
or more of the following are applicable to your child: 


-Frequently wears black clothing. 

-Wears band and/or rock t-shirts. 

-Wears excessive black eye makeup, lipstick or nailpolish. 

-Wears any odd, silver jewelry or symbols. Some of these 
include: 
reversed crosses, pentagrams, pentacles, ankhs or various 
other 
Satanic 
worshipping symbols. 

-Shows an interest in piercings or tattoos. 

-Listens to gothic or any other anti-social genres of 
music. (Marilyn 
Manson claims to be the anti-Christ, and publicly speaks 
against the 
Lord. Please discard any such albums IMMEDIATELY.) 

-Associates with other people that dress, act or speak 
eccentrically. 

-Shows a declining interest in wholesome activities, such 
as: the 
Bible, 
prayer, church or sports. 

-Shows an increasing interest in death, vampires, magic, 
the occult, 
witchcraft or anything else that involves Satan. 

-Takes drugs. 

-Drinks alcohol. 

-Is suicidal and/or depressed. 

-Cuts, burns or partakes in any other method of self-
mutilation. 
(This 
is a Satanic ritual that uses pain to detract from the 
light of God 
and 
His love. Please seek immediate attention for this at your 
local 
mental 
health center.) 

-Complains of boredom. 

-Sleeps too excessively or too little. 

-Is excessively awake during the night. 

-Dislikes sunlight or any other form of light. (This 
pertains to 
vampires promoting the idea that His light is of no use.) 

-Demands an unusual amount of privacy. 

-Spends large amounts of time alone. 

-Requests time alone and quietness. (This is so that your 
chid may 
speak 
to evil sprits through meditation.) 

-Insists on spending time with friends while unaccompanied 
by an 
adult. 

-Disregards authority figures; teachers, priests, nuns and 
elders are 
but a few examples of this. 

-Misbehaves at school. 

-Misbehaves at home. 

-Eats excessively or too little. 

-Eats goth-related foods. Count Dracula cereal is an 
example of this. 

-Drinks blood or expresses an interest in drinking blood. 
(Vampires 
believe this is how to attain Satan. This act is very 
dangerous and 
should be stopped immediately.) 

-Watches cable television or any other corrupted media 
sources. (Ask 
your local church for proper programs that your child may 
watch.) 

-Plays videos games that contains violence or role-playing 
nature. 

-Uses the internet excessively and frequently makes time 
for the 
computer. 

-Makes Satanic symbols and/or violently shakes head to 
music. 

-Dances to music in a provocative or sexual manner. 

-Expresses an interest in sex. 

-Masturbates 

-Is homosexual and/or bisexual. 

-Pursues dangerous cult religions. Such include: Satanism, 
Scientology, 
Philosophy, Paganism, Wicca, Hinduism and Buddhism. 

-Wears pins, stickers or anything else that contains these 
various 
phrases: ""I'm so gothic, I'm dead"", ""woe is me"", ""I'm a 
goth"". 

-Claims to be a goth. 

If five or more of these apply to your child, please 
intervene 
immediately. The gothic culture is dangerous and Satan 
thrives within 
it. If any of these problems persist, enlist your child 
into your 
local 
mental health center.

"event","So I had an awesome wednesday night! It was seeming to be just another boring day, until I called Chris. WE jsut talked for a bit then the movies came up and we were like lets go! And it just so happened my new friend Jenn was going to the movies too. And she lol was trying to set me up with a friend of her's Kim. So I invited Kim along with us. So that makes 3 and to make it seem not like a lil third wheel thing we kidnapped Tiffany from her house again! So we were gonna go see King Arthur but that was too long. So we went to see Stepford Wives. ITs a really good movie. Not the normal movie we are use to, ya know blow stuff up, but a robot head did get smacked off! 
So yeah Kim is really nice, and funny, and she gets along with my friends. So to back track a bit. Our movie started at 7:20, and the movie I thought Jenn was going to was at 6:50 but they had to go pick someone up from rome and then come back here. So i called them at like 7:05. So they were late, and I already got Kim her ticket. So we waited out in the storm, ok the storm wasn't there yet, but it was a shibby lightning show! So it got to about 7:15 we walked in and grabs some snacks and thento the movie. We got a good seat close the front but not really. About only 10 mins in to the movie Kim called me. So I jumped up and meet her in the Lobby. Yeah I mighta been a lil nervous but hey I think I'm allowed just a lil nervousness. So yep meet her, she is really cute. Then we just went in and watched the movie.~~~~<-thats time moving fast lol.  
When the movie was over we walked out and it was raining alot. And I told chris to unlock the car. And stupidly I belived him and ran to the car and stood there..... yep getting wet, then I ran back, he unlocked the car I got in. But noone else was coming so again i ran back. Then finally we went in.... after I was soaked....  
Chris and myself were a lil hungry, so I suggested Taco Bell. But then that turned in to Denny's. I got pancakes ummm and the other got other stuff hehe yeah can't remember. But then jenn came over with her sister and their boyfriends. So we talked to them for a bit. We finished up said good bye to Jenn. So it was hmm about 10:30? yeah sure thats a good time, we dropped off Kim yeah... hehe. We decieded  to grandma baldwin's house after driving in a huge circle.  Oh yeah I thought I lost my glasses too, but they turned out to be in the front seat. So yeah I talked to kim online a bit when I got there then she went to bed and tiffany and chris started talkj to random people lol yeah I feel asleep. So it was about 2 when I got dropped off and fell asleep after my eyes freaked out because they were so dry.  Yep so it was an awesome night!"

"event","<P>Well alot to go in here since I last updated. Hopefully my memory will be nice to me and allow me to remember it all. Washington D.C.,the uber shibby times with Sheena and Chris, and anything else I can think of. </P>
<P>Well alot of people didn't know this but I went to Washington D.C. (all for top secret government reasons... yeah right) Nope we left hmm, well we were suppose to leave at 8-9 but that turned in to 11:30 after we got things from walmart. We are running on ""Chris Time"" let me mind you. So on our way we didn't take 81, we took a whole bunch of ways. And I'm still sticking to it Penn. is the most boring state ever. Not one single Amish person I saw.... ""Hello! Ishmael you out there?!"" After making our way out of non-amish-land we were pretty much there. We were paying too much attention and we thought we were going the right way until we got lost. But thanks to the all powerful atlas, my cell phone and Mr. Baldwin we got there safely. Had a good chicken bbq dinner when we got there. I met everyone one, his uncle is alot different from what I remember (in a good way). So we slept out on the porch in our sleeping bags. I was fine the first night but Chris I guess is like the Princess and the Pea (hope ya know the fairy tale cause I'm not explaining it now) cause the next night he need to sleep on the sofa cushions. So the first day, Mr. Baldwin&nbsp;(which I will call Todd since he told me to, besides it makes him seem like Mr. B) he drove us around showing us how to get around and how things worked. The city is huge, but not too crowded. So we saw the Jefferson Monument the first day, and some Statue called the Awakening it was shibby. Oh and who else knew about the flood of 76? I didn't... damn my gullibility . Oh and answer this in the comments, How many stones did it take to complete the Washington Monument? So on we drove until he let us off at the Smithsonian Museum of Air and Space. I got to learn that there are probably 100,000,000,000 galaxies in the universe at this moment, and astronauts get the coolest 3-d video games, and out international space station is really small. That day we also went to the National Museum of Natural History, That was the coolest! Dinos, beasts, the hope diamond and a horible Imax featuring a T-rex and a girl whacked out on prehistoric egg dust. So&nbsp;that day we just looked around really&nbsp;but then we took the metro! Not the subway mind you the metro.It was also shibby.&nbsp;Its like the monorail at disney but cooler. So we grabbed food.... I can't remember I think it was just some fast food anyways. Then came wednesday, we did alot of walking then, so we went to the Capital and found out I had a bottle which you can not have while going in so we delayed on that a lil but the outside is so gorgeous. So then we walked all the way down to the Lincoln Memorial, which is 4 miles oh yeah! so we saw the big chair and a lot of people sitting on his steps. So as we walk out way back we find the nearest metro which was all the way back to the Smithsonian.&nbsp;As we got hmmm about 400 feet from the metro sign&nbsp;it started to sprinkle just a lil.&nbsp;I looked up and shrugged it off. Then probably 2 seconds later a down pour came down on us. for a good 10 minutes too. We looked around seeing everyone safely in over hangings and such. The entire time we were walking in the rain just cause, we didn't see one other person walking then. Cleared out fast lol. Made it to the Metro and got home. Went to the near by mall and Chris wanted to buy another pair of shorts. So we were on our way walking around, and Chris kinda got ambushed by someone pushing his demo on him. Yeah how was&nbsp;I suppose to know Chris wasn't right behind me, ok I coulda turned around but yeah. So before shopping we went in to the Rainforest Cafe, its jsut like Kahunaville but more robots. So the time drifted by and when we left the mall stores were closed so we headed home. Still waking up at like 8-9 in still just my sleeping bag, we grabbed some breakfast and we were off. Yeah off to do work. Ya see his uncle is a lawyer, and one time his client couldn't pay in with money so he extended his driveway. That was a mistake since he never finished the job.&nbsp;About&nbsp;3 hours of digging pulling and tilling, we killed the&nbsp;hill turning it in to a small mound, which they can no turn in to a garden. Ever heard of a Cicadas, well they are the most nastiest bug ever. Beady lil eyes, can't control their body movements so they just jump&nbsp;on you for the hell of it, they can fly, and they spend 17 years in the ground. They are everywhere, well at least where its a warmer climate. Again we&nbsp;boarded the metro and were on our way to the city. Today was the day we wanted to go in to places and we did. First was the American History, it was ok not that great but very interesting. Got to see stuff from old TV, the first computers. Oh another thing&nbsp;I learned there, <STRONG><EM><U>EVERYONE ON JUNE 4TH THERE WILL BE A SPOT ON THE SUN, THAT WILL BE VENUS IT IS PASSING BETWEEN US AND THE SUN. </U></EM></STRONG>So after that we went to the Capital Building again but this time it was alot cooler there was a protest, or ""riot"" in Chris. It was protesting the lack of funding to aids things. And they were chanting, ""Fight Aids Now"". From the distance across the reflecting pool Chris and myself heard, ""White Man Down"". But we braved it and watched that for about 20 mins. And off we walked to the Washington Monument, we got their in a good time,&nbsp;this thing is huge. But we looked around after walking all that way we noticed all the tickets for the day are gone. So we packed up and went home. And we had a yummy......an edible dinner, I liked the corn.... hehe. Our last night there I finished the Fellowship of the Rings, finally, and all the people were awake other then the babies. Faith their au pair, she is from South Africa, she is really cool to talk to, and I learned that in order to get married they need to exchange cows for women, like a payment for taking the daughter. Well we talked for way to late for all of them and they all went to bed other then Todd it was his shift, but&nbsp;I hopped in bed (sleeping bag) and slept pretty good that night. W again woke up early 8:20 I believe, Grandma Baldwin made us some breakfast and then we took off. Not much went on the way up, still didn't see one amish person the entire way thru Penn. Then I got home.... Yeah i know kinda anticlimactic, I think some of my days are out of order but well you weren't there so you can't&nbsp;contradict me mwhahaha!</P>
<P>So day after we got back Sheena and I watched a movie called Groove, awesome movie, its about a rave. And we watched the Storm. hmmm not much really happened for a few days. </P>
<P>But yeah if you wanna know about Beardsley read Chris's journal. Then you'll have to read mine cause he was too lazy to write the trip. But he forgot to mention the Black Cat that followed us around, I called him Spunky. Hmm...... yep thats all folks</P>"

"event","Ahh a fresh update nothing feel better huh? Well other then lilke fresh sheets out from the dryer on your bed.

So hmm well the tree is completly gone and got turned in to a fireplace for a lil bit. Oh yeah Chris and Sheena are done with school so that is like close to summer right?! Well it sure has felt like it we already have the air conditions in. Hmmm what do you need to know about? OH well since my two best friends are back (kinda I mean they weren't gone but still) we are hanging out alot. And I know this is like evil of me but i'm starting to like the X-Box, I know scary but Halo is uber shibby miester! Yeah killing Chris was fun and killing Sheena with chris was alot more fun too and I've gotten alot better I won alot..... ok a few times. So Sheena and I on friday went out to get chris his present and since my car is being gay lately I got to ride with Sheena, and well yeah she is alot better driver them Chris. I mean at least she goes a lil over the speed limit and she doesn't like almost kill me! lol!!! hmmm oh yeah! Chris graduated!! He is muy happy that he is done with OCC, from the sounds of it, it sounded like a shitty school. I bet it has its upside but well I went there like twice and it was umm boring. So his Graduation which took way to long to read a few names was very nice. Good speakers, Chris looked like he belonged in Hogwarts and bagpipes how much better can that be?! I know Sheena and I matched. yeah I got off topic, we were getting his present at the mall but didn't find him anything. So we found nothing, but Sheena told me what she was wearing at his graduation and wasn't sure if she would wear pink and black together. So I told her black goes with everything, and I said if she wears her outfit I would find a pink shirt to wear with my black pants. I did luckily I had to fold laundry and saw craig had a pink (really salmon) button up. And I pulled it off pretty good too, yeah I didn't really car if anyone said anything cause well not gonna see them again yep. So threw that on and there we go. And two days before that we went to walmart after we watched American Beauty, which I never saw the full thing and its really good, and umm weird. But I got to be Sheena's pillow. Hey if I'm being used by anyone I'm glad its Sheena lol. So yeah walmart, Chris at to get clothes for graduation and well it was late so only walmart was open. It took us about an hour to find him pants a tie and a shirt. Sheena and myself were pointing out some really good clothing but he keep rejecting him. I mean if two of your best friends said it looks good, it looks good. 
So yeah did I tell yall me and Sheena are going to be working out (oh yeah! lol). Yep Running and whatnot to get in shape. And the run was umm ok. But DDR was alot more intense.  We mentioned it to Chris and he wimped out. So yeah So we went to sheena's basement last night and played Halo for about...... 3 hours? yeah i got to bed at 4:49 am. Then mom comes up like 3 times telling me to wake up I look at the clock 7:45, that 3 hours, Brandon does not like 3 hours of sleep its like the tease of sleep. It was so we cound help Wayne and Deean Aunt Amanda's parents (spelling error i think) move their home in to their new home well garage at least. It was a mightly pile of stuff we fit in there. But I got dounuts outta it so it was worth while, now that I think about it I guess I'm the only grandchild that could lift all those things, i mean Grady is still too little, and the rest are all girls. No offense just well the girls in my family are well not that very much strong. So got home around 11 and still awake, not really tired just here yeah... Well that should hold everyone over for awhile.

"event","Well this was a fun fun few days. So on Saturday was of course movie day! Went to see 13 going on 30. I high reccomend this movie cause its funny, and it shows that you shouldn't forget who you are. My movie goers were Chris Kelly and Amy twas fun. Even if we were gonna go see Kill Bill vol. 2 but its ok I'm glad we didn't. So after the movie we sta in the drive way of Amy's house and just talked about... umm lol stuff I can't remember. But we found out I still can fit through the small hole in the seat. So after Amy left we went to grandma Baldwins house and watched the mean moive of me showing Sheena how to be sexy.... So the night was concluded and I had to wake up early to go see Chris play at his las ever wind emsemble at OCC. So we got there a whole 7 minutes ahead of time! Chris went off to his practice and I was gonna go walk around but it was raining so I trecked a good 30 steps to the library. Tina Fey, Michelangelo's David and something else were that day's USA Today's big headlines (in the life section) So he played awesome! Clay his arch rival (actually clay is jsut a lil bastard) he sucked, well from the most I know about intruments he sucked..... yeah. So lets see monday was boring did nothing.... Then oh yeah My tree! For those of you who, that don't know Davey, Megan, Myself, Ashley and Mallory each have a tree in our yard. Our Papa Jim each named one and gave it a birdhouse with our names on it. Davey's was the first to go, then Megan's is slowly being cut down due to the apple decline. Ashley's is too huge to move, and Mallory's is still kickin near the well. But due to ""progress"" (we are putting in a new patio) and the fact it shaded the pool and was rotting it was his time. So Wed. night we cut it down. Almost crushed dad but it was all good. And today we cut off the branches and lobed the trunk to firewood (which will be dryed next summer). So yeah it sucks a lil but I still have the Locust tree out front I shall call him Firewood Jr.  But it was a resilent tree and it scratched the hell outta me! 
Thats All Folks

"event","I was reading through the yearbook just now and read my memories. Yeah I should have put so many more, to bad we didn't have like a video yearbook. So I dunno, I feel like putting them here..........

Making my future house with Arlo. All of my science classes with Meghan. Regretting ever wearing thst stupid hat.... Always falling for Tracy's stupid finger trick. Sitting on the bus with Inna for like 2 years and never talking to her, also her hot pictures! All the hallways I stood in from 7 to like 9th grade with my friends, and drinking that nasty hot stuff. Hating Christopher Baldwin in 9th grade for I dunno why. Talking to Chris and Jenny in Mrs. Beaver's class. Joe's sleepover and me saying the stupid things. Lee's going away party. Finding out that 5 people couldn't see the gears were in reverse. The almost successful Haunted Walk at Joe's. Arguing with Joe that we were actually in a gym and study hall together. Art class with Dustin, Dan, Dave, and Victor, along with my sucky paintings. FRED. All the times sitting in the big chair listening to Coalition playing. Me believing that Chris' grandma was from englad when it was him in a dress. Forgetting Rebecca Joesph's name all the time in 1st grade. Meeting Arlo and Dan in 4th grade.Amy being overly cheery in 1st period, it was a good way to start the day.  Sleepover with Arlo and Dan, with dan sleeping in a corner with purple socks! Getting my first kiss from Katie Ireland like on the cheek, in kindergarten. Steve's stalker in 9th grade. Leary's handshake hugs.....yeah... Getting in trouble with Ms. Walas for talking to Nicole. Just holding the cards while I ""beat"" Wenham at Magic. Mike Moerman wearing Julies's underwear at Steve's party. Anything with Curt. Having my ""girlfriend"" ask me if I want to date another girl while I thought we were still together, but I guess she broke up with me and just forgot to tell me. lol. Laughing when I heard two jocks called me cool. All the times playing on the playground with Breann and the rest in elementary. Taking Kelly to homecoming, then having to carry Kayla down the stairs cause her dates was a dick. Piano Girl. Sheena's Butt. Trying to figure out what Liz was spelling in Chris's songbook. Walking in more then I wanna remember on Chris and Kristen kissing. Being an asshole....yeah that happened too much.

Memories are one of the funniest things. They are like pictures in your mind that can be triggered by the smallest thing. But its kidna sad that we might lose these precious memories. Like I said with friendship it makes you who you are. Well the memories are what keep us, us."

"event","This is something I've been pondering since High School ended. 
What is going to happen to my friends and everyone I care about?

Well unfortunatly time heals all things, like the answer to my question. Not being close to everyone really messes everything up. On a day to day basis you see the people you see at the same time and at the same place. So then you leave that, yeah it seems awesome at first but soon you miss that day to day routine. And things slowly break down. First its normally college, everyone spreads out, so there goes seeing them on weekend. And this isn't a bad thing, they make new friends. Yeah so you might, think are they replacing me? Think of your life as a clay ball, each friend makes an impression on you and soon you are what your friends and family make you. Soon you are a sculptur of your self. You have your own identity, your own look, but that is because you are a combination of your friends mixed and thrown together. So in high school you keep that shape. Getting out you meet even more people and you get a different form. Yeah you always keep the things you were taught by your friends, but you might get chipped and worn out some. Theses chips and old spots might be important things you picked up from your friends......... yeah I think I totally lost my point...Lets try this again shall we 

My way of seeing Friendship.
 
Ok first thing to say, Everyone probably only has 3 Real Friends, I'm not talking about boyfriends and girlfriends, cause well unless you know u are getting married this is kinda unreliable, and yeah these people change in time oviously.

Almost everyone I've meet is a friend to me. Which is why I always want to help my friends. I mean even if one of them are having a problem i try to be there. Yeah I might have a bad hero complex, but I in my way of thinking none of my friends should really feel bad. For any of my friends I would pull the moon down for them if needed.... and also if that was possible. I've lost friends, I mean everyone does and really sucks. Even if I'm not the best of friends with them I'm still going to be there if they need me. That doesn't mean they need to be friends with me, but it just shows myself that I don't care about that you were my friend once and in my mind and heart you always will be. I guess some people think thats odd of me. They think well this person totally ditched you and hasn't talked to you or they did something bad. To me it means shit. They need me, I'm there. Even maybe at times it goes against my better judgement. Which I try to make them see what they are doing and so they can see that there is something better out there. So this might be a bad thing but I'm always willing to take them back. I say I'm not letting them back I really am mad at them but then I think about it and decide I'm being a lil prick, and not being myself. This is the way I am, Everyone has one big trait in them, mine is just Friendship. No matter what my Friends will always come before anything and everything .... (ok excpet big family things) I need my friends, physically, mentally, and spiritually, they are me. They made me who I am, inside of my is alot of spirit that I have borrowed from my friends and I owe them alot. So if I haven't talked to you in awhile I'm sorry, and remember you are always going to be with me."

But something happened and it was just Chris and myslef that went to see Hellboy. It was a good movie, not as much action as I thought but it was still definatly a good movie. So we called Liz before the movie and we check to see if she wanted to come, unfortunatly she had to watch Mike last night. SO we tried to find Kelly. They did call Chris during the movie but we just decided to talk to them after the movie. So we tried to call them and yeah we got nada. So yeah that was a lil weird..... So We decided to call Amy since we haven;t seen her in awhile. We went to Walmart where I kept playing Hide and seek with the two of them. So chris bought something... umm... yeah honestly can't remember but we got two bouncy balls the big kind for 5 dollars. So we headed back to Grandma Baldwin's house and it turned in to daylight savings time so it was 3 when it was 2. So we threw the ball around two at a time when we invited (yeah oviously people have done it before but so what) Extreme Catch. We were going pretty fast too and at times We switches the rotation. and lol We tried to hone our senses and do it with our eyes closed. So we did that until.... 5:45?? yeah all in all I got home a lil late..... yeah so it was another good Saturday."

We were suppose to hang out with Sheena but her teeth were killing her worse today :( I hope she gets better soon. (she got her wisdom teeth pulled) So we drove down to the school to tell Jessica something then Shannon Perry told us to call her sister. So we did that picked up Meghan and set off to Chatterbox. I got the same thing, but it as always is good. Chris and Meghan got French Vanilla Cappicino.... think I spelt that wrong. Anyways of course their drinks were still too hot but mine was just right, Chris goes to the bathroom and comes back, he tells me to check it out and he gets a smoothie since he didn't like his drink. He sits down and moves his hand and knocks his drink right in to his lap. Yeah it was funny, he said he liked it for a moment cause he was cold but it cooled off quick. So I had to drink my Latte then Chris' half of a drink now. For some reason I didn't get all hyped up oh well. So then Chris' car just ..... rocking everytime it changes gears so we had to switch to the van. We left and we grabbed a cool movie game. Since Chris knows more he was his own team and me and Meghan were a team. We were so close especially since Chris was missing some damn easy questions. Me and Chris kept screaming answers so our throats started to hut a wee bit But we lost. No prob. It was about 2:30 then so we packed up and left. I was home by like 3:22, (cause we had to drop off meghan, and we were in the van) watched a lil bit of Inuyasha and feel to sleep.  So i woke up and My throat is killing me! yeah that was a fun day though. lol and we still have Saturday to go through!"

So we had no clue on what to do last night so we drove around some and called some friends of ours none of which were home or answered. So we called Liz's cell again, no answer. And since they STILL have no home phone line we can't call that. So we drove over there and went up to the apartment. I called her on my cell right infront of the door and I could hear it ringing and no one picked up, and we definatly heard them talking inside.  So I knocked and Kelly answered we said hi talked a bit. Liz invited us in and said her boyfriend was playing the Simpsons game, yeah she has told us a few times he doesn;t like us so why they hell would i want to put my self in that?! Kerri and Brett and two other people walked by said a casual hi. And you know seeing that we haven't seen Kerri in like a long time you think it would be a lil more energetic then hi. Anyways and well yeah we kinda pretty much snuck out gracefully I poked my head in to say goodbye, and I think Kelly and the people I don't even know said bye. 

So we grabbed some food at IHOP saw the first girl Chris ever asked out and she was our waitress. 

Then off to the weekly Wal*mart visit where we saw Matt from high school he is going to college up in Maine it was fun talking to him. We talked to him for like an hour, and dodged they sweepers taw fun. Then he left to find his girlfriend and we went to the cd section. And she came up to us and asked us if we saw Matt. so we told her that way and he came up to us and we said that way and then we all went looking for her. LOL 

So well that was Saturday. yeah I was pissed from what our friends did but all in all it was an ok night. Well I'm going to see Sheena today with Chris so it will hold more fun then last night."

So Chris and myself went down to the Chatterbox to meet Amy and her friend Alica (sorry if i spelt that wrong). Since I didn't know what to order I asked them what had and I got an English Toffee Latte. Damn stellar if I must say. And we even got to sit in the loft area, yep looking down on everyone was pretty fun. So I drank my latte and Chris didn't like his so I drank half. By that time it was time to take Amy home. So we are driving along and Chris sees something flappin. Yep it was a parking ticket. Just a 20 dollar fine, which is so wrong since he was like 50 feet from the sign. Anyways we we about to go home and we decided to call Liz to see if her or kelly wanted to do anything  Saturday night. And it just so happens that our friend Kerri that lives there was there that night. So we talked a bit meet Brett her boyfriend, they left and we stayed a lil bit longer but the girls got tired and we left. So after that it was boring cause I just went home. 

Today was the St. Patrick's Day parade. Fun Fun I tell ya. If you like standing for 3 hours, in the windy snowy hell. But it was fun my Uncle was in it this year with the State Troppers. Some good floats and others not so good. But I got candy outta the deal. So Meg, Craig, Ash, Layla, and myself went to Zebbs grabbed some food and came home. And now I'm tell you all about it. 

So tonight we are hanging out again I mean come on it is Saturday. Dunno what we are gonna do might go to the Chatterbox again. Wonder if any good movies are out. Oh and Sheena and Meghan Perry are back so we'll have to do something with them sometime. Yeah Sheena is getting her wisdom teeth pulled Tuesday so we have to do something with her before she has like a shut down. hmmm oh yeah if anyone wants to reply and not set up a whole thing here jsut do it in my sub-profile ok? ok! Well now its time to lay back for a bit before I go out tonight. Adios."

"event","<P>So update time once again. I got a haircut. I always feel alot happier after I get one. Tiff came over and I gave her my old playstation. I felt I had to because no one should have to stop playing Final Fantasy VIII. So she came over, we talk online all the time it just felt weird since I actually haven't talked to her in a really long time. But ackward moments aside it was ok. So a lil later dad got hom and started to make Beef BBQ, and I went upstairs. Talked to Colleen for a bit and then she invited me over. Again another friend of mine I haven't seen in forever. So I headed down to her dorm talked a bit. Yeah I still would really like to burn all of those pictures of that homecoming, she looked fine I was just a huge dork. So then she took me to her boyfriends house. They bought two puppies, pitbull-boxer mix, still puppies so they are still cute. Diamond is Col's the girl, and Assasian is Justin's (aka Buckley). Yeah thats the boy, he wants to get its ears cropped, ya know cut them down to make them pointy. Its just so he will look more ya know bad dog type. I don't think that is gonna work with Colleen around she seems to baby them lol. So we headed back to her dorm and watched Lifetime lol and I helped her out on Outline. You would think me of all people would know that Arisotle thought all things were made up of the 4 ancient element, Earth, Fire, Air,and Water. Also one of Ether that was symbolized in heavenly bodies like stars.So came back home had the BBQ and went to get hmmmm 20 boxes of girl scout cookies. LOL I love the things.</P>

"event","Well since I'm not able to go out tonight Chris, Kelly and myself all went out for a very fun night. 

Chris was going to pick Kelly up and Kim's and I was to meet them. Well of course chris was late, not too late just a half hour, and I had already beaten him like normal. So I hope in the car and we head the the China King Buffet, yes so far this is the best chinese food I have ever eaten. Ok with my friends its, ""In Bed,"" and it always works, You shall recognize your sense of humor at its greatest.... in bed. So nothing really that exciting happened at dinner. And Kelly still had shotty... damn her taking my spot. So after dinner we had some time to kill so we drove around and back down genne. to the mall, were we got tickets to Eurotrip. So far the most funniest movie I have seen this year. Yep Vandersexx, getting a whole lotta stuff with $1.78 in Brataslavic or something like that, getting high off non-hash brownies, and having sex with just a bunch of random europe chicks, and thats all I'm telling ya there is alot more. Oh and see if you can find a very famous person in a role you would never see them in. So yep movie ended and we hopped back in the car and down to Chatterbox the coffee house. It looked pretty cool inside so we make our way down after arguing with chris that the public parking area won't tow your car. So we want in and shoosh! Everyone is stareing at us three standing at the door. We were only there for like 10 seconds or more and then we left. Yes I know I said I wanted to go but I had no idea what to do... shut up I already know I'm dork. So we went in the car and just drove off. we headed towards Frankfort. Me and chris got sorta lost there once so we thought it would kill some time. Yep kept turning and turning. Went straight at Stone Road turned some and we decided to head back home. so we passed Stone Rd. and turned some drove awhile and almost hit some deer good times ya know. Then we come to Stone Rd. again... ok now we are lost. We were near Rt. 51 N and S. So we drove around lost for like 2 hours. Twas fun I say. So we are facing south on this intersection and some cops come up behind us we were stopped and had our hazard lights on. We asked them for directions and went right to Ilion and that took us to Rt 5 thank god for cops! So we drove Kelly home and she was wearing my jacket so I think that is why I wasn't my normal Brando Man self. So headed back to my car and I noticed I really need to get that muffler fixed. So yep hopped in the car and drove off home. 

Yep Good Times buddy!

Oh yeah Chris and I agreed that if we see that Stone Road again we are going to cry."

Today was very intresting I finally stayed up for 24 hrs. I pretty impressed with myself. I did take a lil nap before dinner. So hopefully the insomnia will wear off but eh if not I can always do this again huh? So Amy and I are speaking again, we aren't dating or anything. We've agreed to just stay friends again. Which that is all I want. I just want alot of friends to be happy with. I think I told Kelly once my life would be perfect if I never meet anyone to marry but as long as I had my friends around I'd be set. Yep thats my take on life.

So Blue Mile, thats Chris's new name. He found out that Acoustic Soul was taken. But I think this sounds just as good, and it has my favorite color in it! So he played a trick on Sheena with my help. Mike Zase, 19 went to RFA now going to a college for music in Penn. 5'11"" muscular well built, blue eyes, dark hair, eyebrow ring, plays guitar....... yeah so how does this guy sound ladies? Well he isn't real, its Chris in an alternate universe that I described to Sheena she bought it but that sly chica caught on quickly. It was fun, yeah she thought he was hot too. 

Eh I think thats it for the day see ya guys"

"event","Yeah I told yall I'd keep this updated...... yeah so I forgot big flippin deal. Sorry 'bout that, think its the sleep in me trying to breakout. Yeah still all insomniatic (is that a word?) So hmmm lets update everyone. Been hangin with Chris and Kelly alot. Finally Chris agreed to go out somewhere new finally, next time we go out we are going to the Chatterbox, its this coffee house in utica, Mal told me about it seems pretty interesting . And maybe if we find out Chris might be able to play a song or something there, I dunno I think it would be cool. So Umm what else has been happening to me as of late. Well Amy and I started this thing. From what she explained it was a step up in our relationship, hmm better explaination, we were like a step below boyfriend/girlfirend title. Eh I didn't really get it, but I went along anyways whats wrong with it. 

So along strolls Valentines Day, and Chris and I get all spiffed up you know dressed nice in a tie and shit. So we get everything ready Kelly is coming along she told me she was bringing a friend which was shibby.We asked Sheena if she wanted to come along but she was going to be eating dinner with her family so I told her we would just hang out later that night, unfortunatly that didn't happen it was getting late and we just thought we could see her the next day anyways. We had Amy coming too. That night Kelly asks me if Liz can come along. I saw no problem in that other then she hates Liz. But I thought since Amy and I are kinda dating she would put up with Liz for me cause she knows Liz is like my best girl-friend. I knew Amy would be pissed off but I thought she would be good for just one night. So we got to Delmonico's and it was packed. Chris thought we could get a lil room thing, called ""Wanna Be Italian Room."" But with out luck that didn't happen. We were able to get a nice big table so we took it. 

But before I get into that I must tell you what happened before hand. When we got there we waited for the other half of our group. We got a call and got them, as we walked in Amy saw Liz. Almost right away she told me to take her home. I said no right off the bat. I mean its just one night with my friends thats all i was asking for. But Amy then said she was walking home, Chris and myself went after her, boy can that girl walk. Thank God for me she didn't know we were on Gennesse Street. So Chris and I went back in to Delmonico's and told them Amy left so it would just be us 5. So we sat down and waited a lil to be served. A lil later Amy came up to me and ask for my cell, I gave it to her and she left again. She was trying to get her friend to pick her up. That failed. Chris walked out and talked to her. So I can't give you details on what happened there. But in a way I didn't care because I lost alot of .... hmm I dunno the word,dignity,no,I dunno I just felt that she should have done this one small thing. So chris went out a few more times and she just stayed in his car the whole dinner. So needless to say me and Amy are no more dating or in between or anything. So the dinner was great though! Chris was the only one to get an appetizer but we all kinda ate that. Then dinner and of course dessert. All and all it was a good night. Then we left I didn't go with Chris in fear of being bodily harmed. So I went with Katie (Kelly's friend) and Liz and we went back to her apartment. Like 20 mins to a half hour, Chris and Kelly came back and we hung out a lil more. At the end of the Apartment stage the girls were pretty much falling asleep so we left. 

Chris didn't want to go home so I told him we'd go to one more place but then home. So we went to Walmart. Dude it was DEAD. I mean yeah it was 1 o'clock on Valentine's Day and probably all the couples are having their fun. But still Chris and I were the only ones there seriously! It was creppy like out of the 28 days later movie, or a Resident Evil Game. Still we walked around and didn't buy anything but still amused our self. (yeah did you know the power rangers are back to dinosaurs? just a side note I saw the toy) So we left and yeah he dropped me off. But the funny part about this was that he got stuck on my road. At the end of the raod they don't plow so great so he got stuck right there yeah rocked it back and forth and was stuck. So I got out and started to push the front,hey I thought my feet would work on snow! but then I walked up to the door and pushed a few times really hard and moves it back just enought for him to hit me with the car door.... jackass. SO yeah that was my Valentine's Day. 

Hmm Oh yeah Chris, Kelly and I went out Wed. Which was weird but still we did. Drove around for a lil while then we got hungry so we decided to grab dinner. I already ate a burger that night but this is me we are talking about I was still able to eat. So we tryed a new place we haven't gone to. Mexican! nope not Taco Bell, even thought their taco's are super! But we went to Casa To Mucha. I've only been there once but that was with Spanish Club and in like 9th grade. Anyways good food I must say. I got the Quesidillas! (yeah go ahead and check my spelling) Kelly got some chicken and cheese with rice, and Chris got some other thing. So after dinner which we came at like the very closing time I felt bad but we did give them business and we were hungry. So then I suggested Barnes and Nobles, I needed to use my gift card anyways. I couldn't find a book! Chris and Kelly were off in the kid section while I looked. Then when I said I couldn't find one they told me to find one since I suggested this place. It was almost closing time so I just grabbed something that perked my intrest and got it. Another chinese thing I CHING- Change. It like gives you insight on your dilemmas and such. So we grabbed the stuff and went to Chris' for a bit where he played a new song and I did some I CHING without reading how to use it. Eh it worked all the same. So again Chris dropped us off and that was my night.

So yeah I think that catches you up..... hmm yeah I'll do more stuff to keep thsi updated yup yup"

"event","Well technically this was part of today the early part. 

Well it was a pretty boring day then around when the Family Guy was on I was talking to Kelly. Then my cell rings. No idea whose number it was so of course I answered it. To my surprise it was Liz. So we talked for a bit. She was lonely at her new apartment. Kerri, Kelly, and Liz are all living there. Pretty mature for a 17 year old huh. Well we talked for a while, then all of a sudden my phone cut out. Perfect timing huh. I called back a few times no answer. Of course I got a lil worried, I then tried her cell. No answer again. well I called once more and left a message. Yeah told Kelly about it online; yep so they share a line right now with the people downstairs. So they only call out, I left a message on someone elses machine... Opps
Well Kelly gave me directions... not really good ones but they were enough for me to go on. I went off in to the night.. lol....

Well down in to Oriskany I went. So found my way and stopped my car behind hers. But I didn't know what house to go to. So I turned around a few times and went up to a house. I remembered Liz saying that they stayed upstairs. So I took a deep breath and went upstairs. To my wishes I got the house right; only reason I knew was cause I saw her shoes infront of the door. Well then I got the tour. Its actually a good apartment. Yeah still needs some work but good. So the tour was over and we just sat around talking. Just about anything we could, growing up, how she doesn't have lot of time left :( , and what we have plans for this summer. ROAD TRIP! Yeah so I think I got there around ummmm.... 11:45 or something like it, and we just talked until 1:22. So time to leave cause she had to go to work at 8 that morning. 

So i got to my car I started it up from inside since it was pretty cold. So wnet down and stupid me touched the gas before I got the key in which turned it off. I tried it again and then nothing.... I got ticked off. I got out asked her to give me a jump and well jumper cables don't fit on Liz's battery, yeah thats messed up. so I put all the stuff away, went in to the car just to try it once more. HMMMMM what happened to my car.... I look down oh look the car is in reverse... Well its not the first time that has happened but ya know you think I would learn from the first time. ~~~~these are flashback waves~~~~ Last time this happened was after Sherburn when Liz, Jenny, Chris and I were gonna go out... buit hmm my car didn't start and I broke the key in the whole thing. and it was in Reverse then too. ok enough of that~~~~ So I thanked her and went home. Yep that was my night. Gotta love those spontaneous moments. 

Yeah I kinda have feelings for her still. Yes I know I shouldn't but I do. So shoot me. But she is a really good friend of mine, and I don't want to lose that.

So helping friends is my best quality... thats what I think and I'm sticking to it yup!

Well life is funny huh. Its always so like.....  exciting, inspirational, and fun. Yet at the same time, it can be hurtful,scary, and well bad. Things in life make all way to scared. When you look at everything its really not that bad. That old saying everything has a silver lining... Well look hard enough and it does. Like say your signifigant other cheated on you. Yeah it hurts like hell! But well then it teaches you that they weren't your one.  But if you want you can still keep a friendship out of it. And like I said before friends are the most important thing in your life. yeah well family and stuff but friends is right up there.
Just certain things can freak ya out and make you shut down. But that isn't the way to go about it. You have to be stronger then it. I don't anyone likes to lose. So don't let any problems do that to you either. besides problems go away and if you let them take over you won't be able to see all the good things going on. 
I know by seeing other good things happen to everyone else you might think everything good happens to everyone else, but thats cuase you are only letting yourself see the good things happening to others and not yourself. Good things happen to you all the time. Sometimes in lil ways sometimes in big life changing ways. So those of you seeing all good thigns happen to others don't worry open your doors and let yourself be free again ok. You'll get the good and your time for happiness won't end as soon as you let the first good thing happen ok. 

ok now I promise I will update this more often ok. With all the things zipping around my head I can always write about something"

"event","Watched a movie with my sister and cousin Mallory. Le Divorce...... French people are messed up! Also I would like to say that the Director and Writers of this movie were on crack. The story might make sense to others with like no time on their hands and they are able to pick it apart and find the meaning. But yeah messed up. So how ya like that for my first journal entry.. yeah special huh. So hmm I don't really see the whole point of making a journal online, since journals are suppose to me like ya know private thoughts. Eh no matter guess its justs gives me a chance on how you all think on my thinking.... yeah I got nothing else.."

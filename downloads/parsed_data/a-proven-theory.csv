"event","As far as I know I love sports. Sports sports sports. It's poetic and manly at the same time. I like all types sports; basketball, football, baseball, womens tennis, hockey, golf, surfing etc... My dream job would be being a anchor at Sports Center. There's really nothing that could top talking about sports, watching sports and hitting on sports sideline reporters all day long. So this brings me to this segment: Hot Sideline Reporters List. 

And we start.

1. Erin Andrews, can be picked out by the ever so sharp eye of any college guy within seconds of entering the stadium during a big game where of course you're anticipating your team to upset those douche bags Boise State. The dude will then alert every other dude around him and a mob of cell phone picks will be taken with her in the far far far away background and you and your bros giving the thumbs up or the traditional number 1 sign. She's so hot some guy could even see her through a peephole and filmed her, props on those babe detection skills.

2. Jenn Brown, the people who run sports broadcasting knows that sex sells. Need I say more?

3. Ines Sainz, our Mexican import is legitley. No English? No problem.

4. Rebecca Harlow, Portland Trail Blazer Sideline girl for a few years has moved on to be the new face of the L*kers. Still have a slight crush on her.

"event","""it's like the Sopranos, get over it! find a new show... it's over"" Who would have known a quote from Forgetting Sarah Marshall could have the lingering effect in my life. I think about it and the root of a lot of my problems is simply my inability to get over things. Holding onto ghosts of possibilities what went sour and holding onto the belief of what I used to be. I find myself replaying that phrase in my head when I'm alone with my thoughts. I don't have to blame myself, figure out what happened, blame someone else, I just need to get over it. 
There's a lot that has been nagging me. I feel uncomfortable with how much I get upset when I look at myself in shambles over the ashes of the time in which I was was happier. I'm beginning to understand the phrase ""I am my own worst enemy"" I'm only hurting myself by dwelling. Who knows what will happen in the future, I think if I can just get on with my life I things will be a bit more clear."

"event","So i've decided to post my old yearly reviews before I reveal my 2008 review. A traditional piece of work that I look forward to writing every year. Starting with 2006 when it all started.

<lj-cut text=""What 2006 meant to me"">
As the year wanes you just sit in solitude and have one of the most sentimental times of your life. You reflect. It's times like these that you realize that you're perfectly content with who and what you are. It's like you've finally found the equilibrium, the mutual agreement you've been looking for in your life. However it's times like these that are so scarce that it scares you a little. To realize for most of your life you've never been comfortable in your own skin is a frightening thought.
All my life I've been an awkwardly, shy kid who has had little to no self-esteem. Constantly afraid of how he looked in public and took criticism too seriously, even if it were only teasing. Growing up I felt that because I was Asian where the majority of the population was white, I was the butt of too many jokes. You may be thinking ""Oh great he's pulling out the racist card"" but it's so true. There was nothing more I wanted to be than to be white so I could fit in and loose the slanted eye remarks. I have come to peace with it seeing how I can never change my skin color, the only way to silence the remarks is to succeed in a future that has just opened it's doors in college.
This year I've changed, I know every year people say that at the end, but so many new things revealed itself this year that I really know I've changed. Not the ""I got into a accident"" type of change where I look at the world in a whole new light, but the kind of change that only those who examine you closely could see. I don't know if it's a good or bad thing that nobody has looked that close but on the inside the change made a world of difference.
I think I'm a better person and feel better about myself, but do I still think I'm flawed? yes, of course. Flaws are what makes me, me as much as that phrase belongs on a hallmark card or some song by a cheesy pop band, it's true. I just now realized that I've been correcting all the wrong flaws, for my biggest flaw is my inability to change. For years I've lived a life that is a result from childhood trauma and neglect that had left my emotions tangled and complex. My past is the classic whiny tale of how daddy didn't love me enough to be a father so he left. Which resulted in living a life as if I wasn't worthy of love but masked to the world with my humor and seemingly happy behavior. I lived as if there were those who were meant to live and those who were accidentally born.
I've tried things to fill that void with things that seemed like placebos for happiness ie. fantasizing a new life, finding religion and as terrible as it may sound even resorting to alcohol. But that void always felt half empty or half full. I found that religion instilled a lot of values that I agree with however there is so much left to explore that I am not ready to give myself entirely to a religion in which has presented so many disagreeable issues recently. This year I can't let an idea dictate how I think and live, I have to figure out things for myself. Although I grew up a Christian and always be a Christian this year I arrived on this feeling that Christianity has angered and confused me and I need to find peace before I devote myself to this.
In 2006 I've met some great new friends, became better friends with old acquaintances and became extremely grateful for best friends I've had for a while. As you would expect they've shaped me to who I am today and together we have shaped each other as we spend all day together or weave in and our of trouble on our adventures. In this time where I transition from high school to college I have done some really outstandingly dumb things that if my life were a tv show it'd be on Wednesday after The OC though less dramatic and nobody dies but the audience would be watching intently either rooting for me to succeed or screaming at me for being such an complete idiot, but I don't regret it for it only made me wiser.
For a year that went by so fast the memories and lessons learned seemed to happen ages ago. As I sit here happy with who I am now I know it won't last. I can wake up tomorrow and feel melancholy and go through the motions showing the world I'm human byt feeling the half full or empty void. But for now times like these where I'm in a state of Nirvana, I am alright with how everything turned out, the friendships made and broken, the experiences and the self revelations. This feeling doesn't have to last forever and a day, it doesn't have to happen once a month, it could be just once a year and I am fine with that for it feels like the world is stable once again."

"event","After my counselor meeting today, in which I was told that I need to go to a Psychiatrist to figure out what was wrong with me (along with my winter term schedule). I went to work which gave me a lot of time to think. My thoughts were blurred and rushed which led me to many disgruntling conclusions. Trapped in a maze of thoughts where dead ends was the prize and the confusion leads to panic. I felt my mental stability fleeting until I had a moment of clarity, but it only lead to something clouded by uncertainty."

uggg I hate midterms, I don't know how I feel about the midterm I took last night for bio. 

so I guess today is judgment day. Thank you, white trash of America for electing Bush for 8 years and now everyone is afraid of repeating it. McCain needs to disappear. Same with Palin.

I voted for Obama and Jeff Merkley. I really think Merkley is better than Gordon Smith (aka whitest name ever).  

new CD's out:

New Surrender - Anberlin 
The Alchemy Index Vols. III And IV Air And Earth - Thrice
Appeal To Reason - Rise Against

pretty stoked to listen to them."

the new Old Crow Medicine Show album is pretty good, the only problem about folk music is that it always seems as though a fair share of the songs are just filler songs, but that's just folk music. It's how they write. Like ""Humdinger"", which may be a fun song it lacks the creativity and intelligence that other songs provide.

I'm all caught up on It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia and Entourage. I really was hoping for a new How I Met Your Mother but I haven't seen it posted anywhere online.

I've been sick the last few days but yesterday I heavily medicated myself on Nyquil and that helped me a lot. I don't feel like crap anymore, I just have a cough and have runny/plugged up nose.

Excerpt from the fight I got into with this WSU guy last night. Some 34 year old asshole disrespected Leah at Bianca's tailgate and called her ""Dipshit"" so instinctively I intervened and started shooting shit at him and it get's heated when I got less than an inch from my face and started threatening me. We were starring each other down for a while when he definitely shoves me. The girls held me back and Travis held that guy back. I was so ready to pound his face in. Washington State piece of trash. Surprise you lost 66 to 13 hope you guys have a nice long depressing drive home! The worst is he still wanted to fight after they broke us up, starring me down giving me the nod to go into the parking lot, I really wanted too. 

Last night was we let it rage. 

Got in a fight with Caitie, got in a fight with Leah (although we don't remember about what), got in a fight that WSU mother trucker.

Yeah, last night was eventful. 

Not only was last night crazy, drama is happening. I guess that's what I get for living with girls."

It's funny how much power the female body possesses. Unknowingly driving men crazy. The girl whom you are unable to resist stopping and staring. Her body so perfectly sculpted that even her imperfections just amplifies her beauty in a unique way. A single glance can bring you to a halt giving definition to stunning. And how crushing it is inside when she briskly walks out of your life, when for a moment she was all that you were devoted too and cared for."

The weekend was fun. Friday after the test I hung out and went to multiple people's houses and stuff. Then on Saturday played in Caitie's swimming pool with people and then decided to go to the beach and sleep on the sand. Then on the way back to Corvallis went to a river and played in the river. It was a cool weekend. 

I have no internet at home, stealing with my wireless card is the most painful experience so I avoid it. I also have no TV lame. 

Moving out soon. Cool.

"event","At work today I was thinking...I bet you're thinking 'oh no he's thinking again this can't be anything worth while' well I'm here to prove you right. Ha! Anyway let me share with you my lame revelation.

I found that I'm attracted to girls who end up sleazy. It's like this; instead of me being the guy who is a jerk, I'm the guy who gets into the wrong relationships. The roles are reversed. I'm the poor innocent one and she's always the one who plays with the emotions, and blow you off (both figuratively and literally hahahahahahaaha...oh my audience is not gonna like that joke). It's like the girls that are good for me I don't want but want me and the girls that I do want are terrible for me but I want them. There's some psychological theory behind it I bet. 

hmmm speaking of girls, why is it that only girls read my journal? Is it because i'm the only guy who uses livejournal? or do I write directly to girls? I find that hard to believe, note: the whole week of ""Hot Tennis Girl of the Day"" I guess my writing does appeal to girls in the way that only Barry White can emulate...lawl 

today was the first day of Chemistry 121 and it was pretty long but not too painful.

"event","So I don't remember the last time I watched a movie on tv completely. Usually it's something that i've seen and can live without seeing again, something I loved but is censored and is played all the time or something that just really isn't supposed to have been made. Anyway it's summer time and really during the school year if I didn't want to watch it I would just straight up leave and...cause MAYHEM!!! or something. The point I'm trying to make is i've watched way too many crappy 1 star movies. I mean why do you play 1 star movies? who wants to watch it, who cares and...wtf. A Sound Of Thunder, Like Mike 2 (oh that movie was a winner, what's saddest is that i've now completed the Like Mike series), Paparazzi etc. etc. I feel as though I loose more brain cells watching these movies than drinking would ever. Also the Girls Gone Wild infomercials are definitely on every commercial break. 
Which brings me to the next topic: why is the word ""definitely"" so hard to spell? I always have a problem spelling it. 
Now now I bet you thought I was gonna talk about Girls Gone Wild. But I really don't have much to talk about it. I know i've grown up my whole life watching late night tv and seeing the progression of it. Even though those big censor signs would always block the view I like many other 13 year old boys were excited and envious of those who were 18. 5 more years later I found it laughable that I wanted to buy a copy. haha puberty such an awkward stage of life. 
Now I'm watching an ""ExtenZe"" and I wonder why do they have to make dramatizations so terrible. I also think it's hilarious that they say ""make that certain part bigger"" and when they have the street testimonials with ""real people"" it's so unbelievable cuz how do they find those people? do they go up to random people and are like ""excuse me sir, do you use ExtenZe?"" 

anyway my day was nice...I guess.

I saw Harold and Kumar II and it was sooo great. NPH was amazing as usual. 

which reminds me, I still need to watch the new How I Met Your Mother episode. 

And the show Greek, which I have to say is very good if you look past all the stupid stuff. Overall it's a very good show. 

I've been looking into new shows to watch and I found the show The Carpoolers, which has potential, but I haven't seen enough of it to start recommending it. Also the show Breaking Bad, you know the one with Hal from Malcolm in the Middle but in a dramatic roll as a high school chemistry teacher who becomes a Meth cook. I'm downloading the Uncensored version so to get the whole goodness of the show. It's like you don't like what he's doing but you're rooting for him anyway. It's more of an HBO/Showtime show so i'm really surprised it's aired on network TV, even censored. 

I'm finding new songs to put on my Spring 2008 playlist. It's getting almost full. I'm really trying to not incorporate Fall or Winter term music into this mix.

"event","funny story that I found that I wrote on my Myspace blog a long time ago.	

The Hot Brazillian Girl and Throwing Up Story

The rumor that has been going around about the grad night party thing is that I threw up all over a hot foreign exhange student from Brazil.

Fiction: I threw up all over her
Fact: She was hot, she was foreign, she was from Brazil and boy oh boy did I throw up!

so here's how it went down: It was grad night and I had 5 cups of coffee cuz Bret was having just as much and because I'm a sucker for doing things that is cool because everyone else is doing it like getting AIDS (haha just kidding) anyway I decided to drink as much as Bret was. After I couldn't take it anymore (I hate coffee)  I got  peusdo-energetic and then got emo because I'm a loser with girls. So as I watched people dance and having a good time I get up to dance a bit if someone asked me too, then nearing the end time Bret asks the hot Brazillian girl to dance with me because I told him that I liked her and by then I wasn't feeling all that good (too much coffee and other junk) so Bret put me in a very bad situation:

            me+girl*feeling sick = (oh crap)+(I'm gonna die)^x

    So we start talking and meh dancing for a little while then I signal over to Bret to save me cuz I was ready to hurl. Bret comes over and I leave, I tell him to come up with an excuse for me but follows me as I jet out of the place and holding the puke in, I barely make it to the bathroom until I puke my brains out. Bret tells her that I had food poisioning and Miss Hot Brazillian Foreign Exchange Student didn't talk to me for the rest of the night.
So you see I didn't barf all over her! though it would have made a better story, I'm not Tucker Max, who does this crap just to have great stories. Life blows, I don't have good skills with girls and my luck sucks."

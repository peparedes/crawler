"event","Man, I feel like making a song today. Or at least recording some
stuff.&nbsp; I've got a few drumming parts that I can put together with
my guitar to make some good sounds. I'll proably do it later on today...<br>
I really need to start writing some lyrics for some stuff I've already
recorded. Got it on my comp, just haven't done much with it. But I'm
sure I can make it sound good in a little while.<br>
Anyways, I've had some time to write up a little ditty on my guitar,
sounds good but hell, I think anything I write sounds good.... just
goes to show how egotistical I am, oh well.<br>
<br>
Heh, I gotta go post up some flyers around town to see if I can intrest some people.<br>"

Man, I've heard talk about my school shutting down for it, and they
really should with over 300 people absent with the SAME sickness, oh

my Represenitive and Senator. A lot of fun, telling them to support the
U.N. bill on Global Warming, and to protect ANWR. Too bad I only got
generic replies. Meh, oh well, I won't die. I just hope both of them
actually take what I have said into recognition.<br>
<br>
Hopefully I can take a step towards getting a job sometime soon, but
hell, who knows if that will happen. I just need some damn money to get
to Further Confusion next year, or maybe I might just get a Line6
VettaII head....<br>

guess. Shit, I've been having too much fun and you all know it. You
know you're having too much fun when you make a punk version of
""Do-Re-Mi"". Fuck, It's all for good times though.
Heh, I wish I could just hit this Freshman in the face, he hit me, but
fuck dude, goes against my ethics, so I guess I'll just do what I do
about most other things in our country, piss and moan until something
changes. I'm hoping I get a chance to go to a protest sometime soon,
but who the hell knows if that will happen. Meh, If I don't, I'll just
start one here, and most of you know I fucking will.<br>
Meh, I'm also thinking about doing my mohawk again:<br>

Heh, I just want to get some fucking rest right now, that and some Pepsi!<br>

"event","I have been in a raving good mood lately. 
There is so much to think about right now, and so many exciting things going on
First, I finally went and purchased some well thought about, well needed studio lights
Second, since I purchsed them, I have been trying to book jobs to pay them off, and have been pleasingly succesful with it.
Third, my birthday is in less then 2 weeks, and christmas is a week after that!!

How can iInot be in a good mood,
and to top it off, I get to go to a PUG PARTY tommorow at Hot Diggity Dog. I dont really know exactly what a pug party is, but i assume lots of pugs will be there, therefore making me a really happy girl
Also at Hot Diggity Dog next Saturday, this will be happening....

jenn actually pointed it out yesterday, she wanted me to update it with stuff about her!!!
stef also i think would like to me just update my lj with things about her, i think its the only reason either of you check it
NERDS
anyways last saturday jenn and stef and linz threw a super fun personal shower for me, and i was indeed showered with lots and lots of sexy outfits!! it was really fun, they made sexy food, and a sexy guest book, and made me wear a corset all night long, and made me try on all the items i was given!
this week amongst my crazy work schedule, we got the apt done being painted, and we got new shelves, dressers, and closet bars, thanks to my dad, who is super man
ive got to hang out with my new little brother alot too, i love him tooo much
this week hes discovered his manhood, and its been quite amusing! we've had to teach him why its private and that he cant pull it out in public. he now likes to inform people of that -his sentence of the week- ""sorry i am not allowed to show you my willy"" !!! kids are sooo funny
other then that, less then 7 weeks till the wedding!! i am starting to feel like i have 2 million things to do, but i dont know exactly what they are! 
anyways, 2 more shifts then i have some time off, which i need to get some things done!!
so out for now

what a WONDERFUL WEEKEND
i am absolutly exhausted, but it was well worth it
We began moving in to our new apt Saturday early morning, we had family over all day cleaning and moving
we got mostly everything in!!
Then we had an official house warming party on Saturday night, it was great we had lots of people over and drank and ate in our new place, it was soo awesome.
Then today we did adult stuff, like went to home depot and bought a hammer and a broom
and spent the day rearranging , cleaning, and playing indoor soccer in the apt!!
its so nice to finally have our own place
heres some pics

this was before we started moving in in the morning

we want to put one pic on half the wedding invites, and the othe pic on the other half, just to mix it up a bit
what does everyone think? is the 2nd one too cheezy??
i think i like it, i think with the rebate edges and the texturing on it, i hope it made it a little less cheezy, i am a girl, and i cant help liking a little cheeziness here and there!!

and these are lovely photos of our smashed car, after a drunk drive drove into us while were stoppped,
after we stopped because he almost head on hit the guy infront of us, driving up a one way street, then continued to pull around that guy, and drive into our car, then into a sign!!
gotta love stupid people

also gotta love spending the whole night at the police station, and probably not getting enough  $$$ to fix or buy a new car!! friggin no fault insurance!!"

i dont know what it is about this dog, but ever since i saw them everywhere in tokyo, I REALLY WANT ONE
they are are sooo ugly that they are cute. honestly its been a little ridicoulous lately how much they make me laugh
i was at this print shop today and they had a super duper fat one, it barked soooo funny when i left that its made me giggle to myself all day long
then i looked at a pug book at chapters
they are too expensive, but one day
i will own this funny lookin little dog, and laugh all day longs"

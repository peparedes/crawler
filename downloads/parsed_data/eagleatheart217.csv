"event","I'm sick, which is why you see this timestamp in the middle of the day.  This is my second day out of school and it's boring as crap here at home.  There's nothing to do, and even when the occassional thing to do comes along, I can't do it...because I'm sick.  

Weird things have been happening too...not weird weird, just kinda weird.  On Tuesday, Trey, Audrey and I wore the same sweatshirt, Wednesday, Rachel and I both had tomato soup for lunch (even though she was at school and I was at home), and today, trey and i are both home sick.  Weird.  Or maybe I'm just paranoid lol.

I haven't been going to TFBC in a long time.  I miss all of you guys so much!  There's just something about it...I dunno...something I noticed the past few times I've gone (been a while, but still).  It just seems like 90% of the people going there are just there to socialize.  Don't get me wrong, the more people we can get to church, the better.  But one of my biggest pet peeves is when people come to church JUST to socialize.  Yes, it's definitely great having friends there, it would kinda be lonely without them, but that's not why church is church.  It's to worship God.  And it drives me up a wall that people come to church just to have a party.  So in case anyone was wondering, that's why I haven't been going to TFBC lately.  Audrey (Webb) and Megan (Kellett) have invited me to their church (East North Street, right next to Mitchell Road Elementary) and I've seriously considered going.  They said there's like 10 people in the youth group at most, which is good, I'm starting to like the idea of smaller churches being better, at least for right now.  AND if any of you guys from TFBC remember Mr. Lindsay O'Rear (he used to be the music director for the church), he's at Megan and Audrey's church too.  And he's really, really nice.  

School is going OK, with the exception of me being sick the past two days.  I'm actually doing the worst (grade-wise) in my best subject (math).  But I checked thinkwave, and if everything's right, I wont have any B's on my report card (:-D).  Random: I've been thinking again about going to LA for college.  I just have these phases where I really really miss the business.  NOT the Nashville business, just the industry.  I'm also going through this phase right now where I want to take dance lessons from Jada in Shelby, NC...we'll see how long that lasts.  

ATS is getting closer, which is making me nervous.  I don't know why, it's not like I've never been before.  I mean this is my 8th convention lol.  And realizing that, sometimes I feel like an old fart in the game of ATS b/c I've been at it so long and nothing that big has happened to me.  Well, ok, I take that back...nothing that big that has stuck has happened to me...it's all been just stuff that at the end of the day, didn't help me that much in my career.  Oh well, I guess if it's meant to be it will happen.  Whatever that means.

I realized the other day I haven't sung, just sung for myself, in a long time.  I mean I've sung at practice, and I've sung for shows, and in chorus, but not sung just for the heck of it.  I miss that.  

I'm gonna go...au revior."

"event","Hey you guys.  I'm really tired tonight..I haven't really done anything to make me tired, but I just am. I don't really feel the best either.  I have two canker sores in my mouth and i can feel another two on the way..which totally and completely sucks with braces.  And I have no idea how to get the guy I like to notice me.  Oh yeah, I'm terribly POed at my agent in Nashville..ugh that's a whole story in and of itself.  Other than that, things are great. :-)  But I really am happy, I'm alive.  I'm healthy, and God loves me for who I am.

Tonight's list...: 
10 Things I wanna do before I die that I haven't done so far: (in random order)

1. See one of the 7 Wonders of the World
2. Graduate College
3. marry the guy of my dreams
4. raise good kids
5. not take life too seriously, but at the same time, not be stupid
6. go to Hawaii
7. drive across country
8. live in the south (kinda doing that already, but I wanna live down here after college too)
9. witness God's love to 7 people
10. earn a decent living doing what i love

Okay, so I was thinking about this whole boyfriend thing.  I don't really NEED one..of course not, all I need is God..but I just want somebody to hang all over (i know it sounds weird, but not in a perverted way lol) and to be there for me when I need him.  Like if I've had a bad day, he'd just come over and we could hang out in the back of the truck and just talk.  Or I could go over to his house just because and bring him a bottle of his favorite drink and we could just watch tv.  And we wouldn't have to talk a lot, but just being near each other would help.  

10 Things I look for (and don't look for) in a guy: 
(i know, another list...sry I'm getting into these things..)

1. Has to have a good relationship with God
2. Has to be nice, not in a bad mood all the time (see also #6)
3. Needs good sense of humor...he's gotta be able to make me laugh after ""those kinds of days""
4. Doesn't cuss and/or drink and/or smoke
5. Has to be taller than me (that's the only thing physically that I care about)...I'm about 5'7"" by the way lol
6. Has to be a 'glass half full' kinda person...cause im a 'glass half empty' kinda person and if he's like that it just makes me feel worse
7. Has to be intelligent
8. Doesn't care if I'm in an evening gown, hair done and tons of make-up or if im in sweats, hair in a messy bun and no make-up (pretty much meaning that he has to like me for me)
9. Can't be an Auburn fan (I'm sorry, I know that's kinda weird to put on here b/c its ""not that big of a deal""..but it really is to me..Bama football is...almost everything)
10. Has to get along with my family


Okay, I'm pretty much done for tonight.  Gonna hit the sack early so I can get some rest and feel better in the morning.  Goodnight :-)

"event","Okay, I'm trying something new.  I'm gonna try and put a list on most entries from now on.  Don't ask why or how come or anything like that.  Just go with me here..  if it seems retarted after a couple entries..ill quit.

Here's tonight's list:

Top 11 Things i love: (i couldn't just pick 10)...in random order

1. GOD!!!
2. my family (including my doggie) & my friends
3. boys
4. univ. of alabama
5. being a country girl and driving my truck with the windows down and the music up
6. sports (football, baseball, basketball..in that order)
7. summer nights layin in the back of the truck listening to music
8. laying in bed watching tv
9. not caring what people think
10. where i live (including city, neighborhood, house, & room)
11. bbq & my grandmother's layered strawberry shortcake 


I think I like someone...but I'm not sure.  And there's nothing really to do except wait and hope he likes me too.  And there's just too many things that happened by coincidence for me to take it lightly...I dunno.  Boys are just weird..they make you do weird things.  *sigh*, whatever happens, happens..and whatever doesn't, doesn't.  

Gonna go hit the sack.  Love ya.  ~Sydney"

"event","OK.  Random update.  Very random entry.  I found a notebook of signs I have made..not many signs in it, but the ones that are in it are cute.  Anyway, the signs read: 

1. ""The Lord will guide you always.   ~Isaiah 58:11""
2. ""When I am afraid, I will trust in you.  In God, whose word I praise, In God I trust, I will not be afraid.   ~Psalm 56:3-4""
3. ""In my anguish I cried to the Lord, and He answered by setting me free.   ~Psalm 118:5""
4. ""The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me; your love, O Lord, endures forever.   ~Psalm 138:8""
5. ""The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain.""   ~Dolly Parton
6. ""There's always someone who loves you more than you know.""
7. ""The Lord upholds all those who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down.   ~Psalm 145:14""
8. ""Orange is a wanna-be RED""


Yep, that's all for now, I have another signs notebook that has a lot more in it, but I found this one today and I thought I would share my discovery with everyone.  

Scary night tonight: Lucy got sick. And not like puking sick..like infection sick.. something was up and we called the emergency vet and they said to bring her in, so we did and it turns out all she had was an infection, but still...I dunno it just scared the crap out of me.  anyway, she's fine, they gave her a shot and us some pills to give her..said she'd be fine in a week or so.  

I've been reacquainted with someone from my past (not that far back, just elementary school) lately and I've suddenly realized how much I liked him then and how much of a good person he is now.  (Notice I didn't say I liked him now..I really dont know who he is now)  Anyway..I got his LJ link off his profile and he's been putting in lots of his entries recently stuff like: the top 10 things he looks for in a girl (is it a coincidence that i fit 9/10 of those?? LOL).  THE POINT OF THIS PARAGRAPH IS....im not sure of whether I should try and contact him further...like give him my phone number (not in a slutty way) and say we should go hang out sometime or...i dunno.  I don't know him very well, but then again, wouldn't that be the point of spending time with him, to get to know him, ya know???  From what I can tell from his LJ he's still the really sweet guy that he used to be..given that he's grown up a lot, he's still seems like a really awesome guy.  I dunno, just write me a comment and tell me what you think... :-\

I think I'm gonna go, I'm so tired..didn't get a nap after HSAP testing today.  Oh, and to clear a rumor that's probably going around EHS...trey and i are not going out.  i repeat: NOT going out.

Goodnight all.  I luv you. ~syd"

"event","brett michael's is the wildest thing to ever hit nashville star.  this is hilarious.  im watching him, jody, jayron, the cowboy dude, and ERIKA JO (THE LAST GIRL ON NASHVILLE STAR!) sing one of Poison's songs...this is absolutely hilarious.  seeing cowboys sing poison's song.  and i hear sara evans hosting...guess leann's still sick.  

anyway lol.  how is everyone? i'm doing well. i went back to school today. scary scary times. man i haven't seen 3/4 of those people in the better part of a year.  some of the people i wanted to see and some i would've paid not to see - we wont name any names. but im there for the next two days so i might as well make the best of it.  i <3 ehs.  

ya know, this is really random and im probably just rambling on..but did you know that gas in inman, sc is $1.99 a gallon for regular unleaded and in g-vegas it's AT LEAST $2.05..its ridiculous.  and its ridiculous how i get 13.5 mi/gal in my truck.  utterly ridiculous.  but i love it and you couldn't pay me a million bucks to give that truck up.  

ive realized that finding a good boyfriend is an extremely difficult task.  most teenage guys, (sry yall, i still luv ya) just do not have the qualities that most teenage girls are looking for.  yeah we want someone to be physically attractive, but we dont want the most important thing in the guy's life to be pigskin and cleets (dont get me wrong, sports are very important, but not everything).  more later about boys...

im gone.  goodnight all.  <3 ya.  ~syd

ps - my computer may be in the shop for a while, its just fartin again.  so if you dont hear from me, im not dead."

"event","Hey guys.  I'm feeling very random at the moment, so a warning in advance for all the random-ness that might be only a few words away.  

I painted my nails lime green last night b/c I was bored and ya know, I just don't like it.  I thought I'd like it b/c it's the exact opposite of a really normal color like pink or red, but it's just kinda ugly.  And my dad mentioned something about it at dinner and I told him I thought it was kinda like a mix between the yellow and green colors from a john deere logo and he just looked at me.  lol it was funny.  Anyway, I think I'm gonna change it..maybe some royal blue and red for the Braves.  Speaking of the Braves, today was opening day...played the Marlins..we totally sucked.  I didn't get to see what the score was until the bottom of the 8th and it was 9-0 Marlins..yeah..bad.  Smoltz was starting today too.  I don't recall the last time he started on opening day.  I'm sure I could find out, but ya know I just really don't feel like it.  

Anyway, I got my hair cut today.  How short you ask? Short.  Well, I dunno, not really that short.  Shoulder-length.  Before it was like halfway down my back, but I just needed a change.  It's a whoooole lot lighter too.  I like it though, i have a ton of layers...which is good.  its also darker.  i didn't think it was that much darker, but when my dad got home he was like ""whoa its dark!"" haha. but its definitely not black lol

I went by Lake Forest today.  A lot of memories there.  While I was driving I thought about a few people who live over in there who I haven't seen in forever.  Well, ok, one person.  And i promise i didn't go over there just to think about them, haha, I had to get to East North from Edwards and there was construction in Botany Woods.  But it was really nice to think about them again.  I miss them.  

I was really mad at myself today at the gas station..yesterday, regular unleaded was $2.05 and today it was $2.11...how crazy is that.  $0.06 increase in 24 hours!  that's insane.  how can a girl with no job pay that kind of money for 2 gas tanks?  ugh.  anyway, that's not the point lol..the point is, i'm a dork - i parked on the wrong side of pump and then i forgot which tank was empty so i just filled up a full tank...then when i did get parked the right way, i parked so far away from the pump that it would barely reach the rear tank..anyway.  It was crazy.  and im a dork, imagine that :-P


>Oh I swear this town gets smaller everyday, 
and I'm waitin for my chance. 
I'm gonna break away.
I'm so sick and tired of being told what's good for me.
People got lots of ideas, of who I'm supposed to be.

well im gonna go.  oh my go-go boots came in today for the show on saturday (dont ask lol). goodnight all."

"event","ok, so not much is going on.  just watched the bachelorette...such a good show.  but she eliminated ben.  he's SO cute!  ugh anyway.  he kinda reminds me of a particular someone on the football team that i used to (yes, USED to) have a crush on..i think yall know who i mean lol.  anyway, he's still cute, but they never got to spend any time together.  too bad. 

so anyway, today's been a very busy day.  too much is going on.  waaaay too much is going on.  sometimes i wish i had no life.  oh wait.  i dont. haha.  that's great.  no but seriously, sometimes i wish i didn't have all this career stuff and that i was just another face in the crowd? ya know? i mean normal people dont have to put up with all this crap that's happening.  eh, yall dont wanna hear about that.

not much of anything else is happening.  oh i went to trey's basketball game again tonight.  he played well.  he made a foul shot!  :-) it was great..and i say that b/c both of us share the lack of talent at foul shooting.  anyway.  patrick davis is on his team too, and parker sisk (i think that's his last name, not sure, cute guy, senior i think), umm, michael mensone, trey's cousin (cute too lol, dont know his name), chad lord, this really tall guy named patterson, and a few other people.  anyway, they're a good team so they won tonight.  big too.  

im gonna go, night <3 syd"

"event","Yes that's right, I didn't update over summer at all. Ya know why? Because I didn't feel like it. I'm lazy, I know, but hey, that's just me.

Summer was all to short, but that's ok, it seems to get shorter and shorter, year by year. Most of summer was incompassed by work and hanging out with Beth. We broke up the Friday before School for me started. It was hard, but we are going to remain friends.

Friday is Regatta night for me and the crew. Fucking Loverboy is playing and we ARE going to see that shit. Anyone wanna go, just tell me and we will meet up somewhere there. It'll be fun. Come on, you know you ALL want to.

Anywho, Summer sorta sucked in a way. It was either work or time with Beth. Free days were spent mowing the grass or something else. I liked hanging out with Beth and all, but I need my space and free time, also my time with other friends. Didn't hang out with them much, but when I did, I felt a lot better about things, then life went crappy again. Oh well, whatever.

I am happy now though, very much so. I'm not afraid to admit what it is, I have the GRAPES TO DO IT! Well yes, it's because I've rekindled my relationship with Anne. She may live 4 hours away, but I don't give two goddamns what people, yes, even you, think about it. Suck it if you have problems with it.

Well, I think I will continue to update over the school year. I'm gonna work on a new layout here soon, maybe when I am done. Who knows? Not me. Jesus might, but he is sitting on a swing set right now, all sad.

Ok, it was short, I know, but oh well. Summer was the same thing over and over so not much to go into.

Later."

"event","Today was... Bleh. I tried to draw all day, but I'm losing all my inspiration. Not many know why, but after that happened, the light started to fade, and now it's just a flicker. I can't do anything, not even a simple picture. I started to draw an RPG character I had a while back that I never used. It has taken me quiet some time to get what I have done thus far, but, well it sucks too, but atleast i'll have a reference to what he looks like. 

School itself was... Bleh... I don't care about finals to much, I know i'll pass them all besides the German one. I should have a 2.50 this term if I pass all the finals with a B or higher, not to hard to do I guess.

Next term I have 3 core classes and then Theater... Pfff. I think I'm gonna drop that class and take Community Service again. I love community service and not having to do that much in my work place at the school. Such enjoyment.

I also want 2nd lunch again, I hate first lunch. With second lunch I can just go to my easiest class (If I have Community Service) and have nothing to do. Oh well. I refuse to have Mrs. Eye again. She always has something up her ass and today that thing must have died.

That woman infuriates me sometimes. Oh well. Speaking of her, I drank some of Jenna's fermenting Orange Juice. BEST DAMN THING I EVER DRANK! Not... Ugh, that was nasty, the after taste lasted most of the day.

After school, I waited around for Nick to get outta 5th block to go up to his house. He got out, I was outside TRYING to draw, but still couldn't. I wasted like 50 sheets of paper today on that. It's hopeless though I think. I have been promised help to find it again. I'm grateful for all of you who push me like this.

I got to Nick's house with Hudnall and Nick, we had to break in. We RPed from about 6 till 9pm. This made the day brighter for me. Seth took me home and his car smelt of weed. It was great! :) I arrow three weed. This weekend will be fun.

I got home in a bright mood, only to be crushed at the point I had reached. My mom got fired today. I don't really like to talk about it, but by the time i'm done with this, i'll be in bed, away from the computer. She worked for some asshole lawyers who I now despise with every fiber of my being. They were just looking for a reason to fire her. I hope they all rot in Hell for this. The reason wasn't one you fire someone over. Apparently they just didn't like that she wouldn't kiss their asses like everyone else.

Fuck them.

Well, that's all I have for this one. Night everyone, have a good Tuesday.

PS: I'd like to thank those of you who take the time to help me out with my problems. You all keep me stable and I'm always here for you guys if you need some help with something."

"event","Hmmm, if you've looked at my actually Lj page you can see I did a new layout. It's Gaara, of the Sand, he's a Character in Naruto. A Badass character. The Kanji on his forehead means ""Love."" ""Love"" is the ""A"" part of his name which means something like ""I love death."" Total badass he be, and the Icon I made is a Quote from him. Pretty Cool huh? Anywho, I felt like updating. I dunno why, no one really cares about this, but I guess i'm really bored. Hmmmm. Two Nights was pretty Cool. I went over to Everret's and played some DDR and Watched like 30 Episodes of Naruto, and I got to keep the CDs with the Eps on them. *Happy Dance* The Show is fucking awesome, someone in school started a Cult surrounding it. Hahaha, I find that morally wrong but funny as hell. Well I didn't go to bed until 12 Pm that day and got up yesterday at 7 Pm. Lol, Then I mowed the grass and Hudnall came over. We Hung out here and then went to Kroger to get a ride with Josh to his house. We Commenced to play poker. It was Hudnall, Josh, Salmon (Josh's little brother), and I and we played some No Limit Texas Hold Em'. It was pretty fun, though I wasn't playing serious I still didn't do that bad. We Played (well they kept playing after I was gone) till about 3 Am. I decided I wanted to head home. So I did, had some time to myself, to think and clear my head. Didn't do much for me though. I hate the way things go in my life. My body feels like it wants to give up on my mind, and my mind is so stressed out right now that I can't hardle think straight. I don't get much time to myself, someone always wants me to go somewhere or do something, and I don't like saying no. I dunno, I really don't know what I want anymore. I need to just sit on the roof one night and think about all the things going on... Maybe that would clear me and get me going again. Life seems like a hassle now-a-days. I haven't even played FFXI that much lately, I just don't feel like dealing with the people on it. Most of them are asses. Douches. Inept, immature bitches that need to get their ass kicked once or twice. Ahhh... Fuck it. Like I can do anything to change them. Changing a humans attitude towards one thing or another is something I don't have time for. I wish Cliffhanger was still open.... That place helped me get my head straight, all my friends there, loud music, a mosh and watching people get hurt for no reason, dancing like a little puppet to the music. I loved it. Anyways, I think I'm done on this update, it's just useless rambling anyways. Later."

"event","I haven't Updated this Lj Since no one really reads/cares about it, but since my Dj is a Friends only thing now I figure I might as well update this one for those few that read/semi-care. Ok, During the summer i've done nothin' really. Sat around, Went to Kentucky and found that unfiltered cigs suck ass. Plus that i'd die faster that way. Not the point, I hardly smoke, only when I'm down/bored. I Digress. Summer this year kinda blew. I was suppost to go see Anne and them but that fell throw like a fatty on thin ice. I really want to go up there, I need fucking Human contact with her, it'd be nice. I don't mind it really, but it'd be a nice change of things. If I do get to go there soon, I'll jump at the chance, i'm not gonna wanna leave lol. That wouldn't bother me to stay there awhile longer. Anyways, I've been in to FFXI like woah, it's my addiction. I hate it for that lol. Damn Square Enix, stupid Japs. Other than FFXI I've slept half the summer away. I Don't sleep during the night, that's when things get good. Nighttime is my whore, it's better walking at 4 Am, Alone, With some music blasting in my ears and just look cool doing it lol. Freak out FUCKERS that drive by me. I need to skate some soon. I'm rusty as fuck at it, I can hardly stand on my board now. Oh Well. Billy is a idiot, he wants me to smoke Mary Jane with him all the time lol. I've thought about it but I really don't wanna do that. It seems stupid for me. Cigs are stupid, and i'm a hypocrite when it comes to that. I'll post that story later on. Cliffhanger was shut down and that blew bawls. I hope SCPD Dies in a fiery explosion. I hate most of them. They hate kids more than anything on the Goddamn Planet. Fuck em'. I've also become more apathetic towards America and all the shit it pulls. Conspiricies, Cover ups, Taxes. Oh a funny story on that, did you hear about it? I'm sure you haven't. Fatness is now a disability, yes that's right, FATNESS IS A DISAILITY! The Fucking tax payers now have to pay for fucking fat, lazy, worthless human souls. And why do they need this money you ask? To buy a fucking treadmil. Last time I checked, walking was free. Fucking American government. Bunch of cack smooches. Bush needs a smack, I'm serious, he's a idiot. Sure our military is awesome, We SHOULD feel safe, but what's that proving. Nothing. The Hunt for Osama. Worthless, and we still haven't caught him. The War In Iraq. What did we get? Nothing. Sadam, if that counts for anything other than any threat from a piss ant country is now gone... No weapons were found there, well one, a uncomplete Nuke... ONE! We could take one nuke outta the sky before it got near us... Our Deficit is the highest it's been in years. Mmmmm, one more thing on it. Here's a actual G.W. Quote: ""We May not have found Weapons of Mass Destruction, but we did get the man who tried to kill my father."" Ok why is that an important reason to send over a bunch of soliders over and have some killed, never to see their families again. That's a horrid thing I think. Anyways, no more political things. Sorry for that. Well That's all I have now really, the rest is nothing important. Later."

Seeing as I'm grounded and can't leave the fucking house I sat around all day. I couldn't do much, i'm limited to tv and games, human contact is a bit more limited. I get 1 hour on the computer (AIM) and 30 Minutes on the Phone. Sucks Huh? Anyways, I didn't even play any games yesterday, well I did, but not to long. I mostly sat on the roof later on in the night (1:30 to about 2:15)and just looked at the stars and stuff, pretty relaxing. Well today I slept till 1 and got on FFXI to about 1:45 and got some exp then went and layed back down. Took a nap (yes 45 mintes after I woke up) and got up again at 5... Hahahaha I'm fucking lazy as hell. Oh well I like it. Well I got up and played Ninja Gaiden and then played FFXI until I think about 10:30 and got kicked off. I'm now working on getting the damned Kazham Keys and it's a bitch. Well after I got booted by the brother I played NG again and almost beat lvl 11 on Very Hard. God that game is fucking impossible. I love it so much. Such a challenge to a gamer. Get it, or die. Well I started playing FFXI at about 3 AM and just now got off and got the urge to update. Hmmm. Oh yeah, my mom woke up a few minutes ago and told me to go to bed, I was like ""Hmmmm. Lemme think about that. No. I'm not tired."" She said she'd call me at 1 and wake me up, works for me, more time I can be online and she not know about it lol. Ok then, you have been blessed with my update, so go away now and live your life.

"event","Lately (meaning this past week and shit) me, Josh, Chris, and Hudnall have been hanging out a lot and I love every fucking minute of it, we do nothing but RP and play games. It's the best summer I've had so far, my friends kick ass. I was loving it till now at least. Me, Josh, and Hudnall stayed at Chris' house and Rp'ed of course. We didn't sleep, that's for the weak when RPing, but we couldn't stay to long so we left there at about 6:30 and went down to Suzi's and had some breakfast, which helped me stay up longer. We couldn't go to my house, we had to avoid my mom at all costs, she woulda killed me since everytime I go to Nick's or w/e I walk home at like 4 in the morning, alone, or with Josh and Hudnall or whoever wants to go to my house. Today was different, my mom has been kinda pissy about it lately but oh well, that's not the point of this part. We decided to cover our asses and hide out in Burger King till about 8 or so. It was funny, I was laying in the boothes and all this shit, fun fun, and they couldn't kick us out unless we were there for to long because Hudnall bought some little roll things. Whatever. We stayed there and rolled up some new Characters (I gots me a Deity who's The Guardian of Death, ya know, makes sure when something Dies that it is sent to Heaven, Hell, or Limbo) and Josh got a Jedi and a gay ass Elder. Both were pretty much crap. Anyways, at about 8ish we went to my house and chilled there. Josh messed with Hudnall while he tried to sleep, the funniest one was when he used my drum to wake him up. It was great, we are bastards, what the fuck do we care though, I know if there is a Hell i'm gonna be there when I die. What are ya gonna do? Well I got on FFXI and leveled up to 24, close to 25 (Go me) but what do you care about that unless you are a FFXI player and know me on there or something (Taru Male. Name: Darkchaos. Server: Asura.) Anyways, Josh wenthome at like 12 and I took a nap. Yes a nap, it lasted for like 4 hours but thats still a nap to me. My mom called and Hudnall picks it up (me still entranced by my pillow, blanket, and the mattress and the great nap I was taking) and she starts yelling at him cuz she called Chris and asked where we were and he said we were there but we went home cuz we couldn't stay the night and all this. He wakes me up and I talk to her and she's yelling and all this, i'm thinking ""Right now, I don't give two flying shits. I'm tired and I'm safe, that's all that matters."" Well she comes home and I get grounded from going places AND my computer time it restricted now. Fuck that pisses me off but like it's gonna stop me from getting on. That's impossible, I know all the sneaky tricks in the book, I've always been the problem child in this house and I'm glad I am. It's taught me the skill of Sneaking and I can almost pick a pocket, not like i'm gonna go steal peoples wallets but hey, if i'm in a hole cash wise I might. Also, it's helped me be able to steal things and look like i'm stretching or something like that. That's a fun one to pull on teachers, stupid bastards. Anyways, enough of the criminal skills, back to the point at hand. I am grounded so I will be on later at night and perhaps at like 12-5 Pm so yeah. Anyways, the day only got worse, after dinner my mom and Dave (her b/f) went to her room to go to sleep and at around 9ish Dave had a Seizure, it freaked me out. We called 9-1-1 and they got here promptly 9 minutes later. My exact words before they got here were ""It's a two minute drive and they have sirens on, God I fucking Love so much West Virginia..."" WEll he's fine so no need to worry or whatever. Well now we are here, i'm sitting in my room, no lights, just the glow of the computer, listening to some songs from .hack//Sign and thinking about a lot of stuff. Well, that's all for now. Nothing else to talk about. Later."

I came home and my mind was at ease, no work today, only 2 more days in that hell hole till I'm out that mug. Shit I hate work so much, cuts into my sitting around time haha. Anyways I came home and it started raining the second I walked in the door, I swear that's happened like 5 times to me lately.

Ok, I'm a idiot, I know, you don't have to point it out to me damnit. Well I got on and talked to Anne and Billy and then had to go to drums for my last lesson until September. I can't wait, that's when I start on drum set so Wooo for me. Well, hmmmmm, I dunno what else to talk about. Ohohoh, Nick is talking to his dad about letting us borrow the Bronco to take to PA. Woot!

Why, how dare you, my journal does not contain subliminal hints that make children eat sugar like a wild beast. How dare you good sir! Ok enough of that, well, I think i'm done....

My mom is going out way to much and the house looks like a bomb went off in it. I know that I'm not the tidiest person around but this is rediculous. I do my part around here, I vacuum and load and unload the dishwasher. I do a lot around here to try and make it look better. The stove has stuff on the top from like 3 nights ago and she threw a rag on it expecting either the rag to do the work or for me to, and thats not going to happen anytime soon. My skool work is slipping in World History, Math I have a B in now so atleast i'm fine in there for the midterms. I hate skool, I wanna just get on vacation. I'm sick of skool and the time it takes to get through it. I'd drop out if I were rich, but i'd have nothing to do and hardly any friends. I have the things around me as well. The weather is starting to irritate me and.... Ugh... I hate cold, I hate hot, I hate it all. Today I had to stay after skool and make up a test and all. It was gay, another reason I hate skool. I hate most of the people in skool and some of them hate me and I really wish they wouldn't. I only hate people that are loud, annoying, stand in the hallways in a close knit ball and take 2/3rds of the hallway up. FUCKING MOVE YOU ASSHOLES! A lot of people hate me because A) I was a goth and I was dating a popular girl (a big no no I guess) B) I look goth and listen to goth music most of the time (but they don't get to know me, I mean the real me) and C) They hate me through a old relationship. I really can't win in that skool no matter what I do. To all my friends that i've known for years and have stood by me during all my hard times in life, thanks you guys, I really doubted I'd still be here if it wasn't for you guys. To my newer friends I have to thank you to, you've helped my morale a lot and kept me in good spirits most of the time. Well I did my report in World History Finally and it was easy. Well, that's all I have for now, sorry for my bitch fest and all but I needed to get that off my chest... Later..."

"event","Well I'm finally updating, though only like 2 people read my entries, but whatever. I'm bored so yeah... Anywho, my weekend was pretty cool. Friday I went and saw Forever Forgotten, it was their last local show so I had to, but I left after they got done. We had to wait a bit for them to play those seeing as one of the Members walked to Burger King which is like a 15 minute walk for slow lazy people *points to self.* Saturday was pretty kick ass aside from the whole ""Me being to lazy to wake up and do something"" part. I was gonna goto the movies with Josh and Jon and see the Punisher but I was to freaking tired to leave my comfy computer chair. Sunday was slow, I got up at like 3 and had to Babysit the whole freaking day. It blow nuts harder than anything has blown nuts before. Well the Demon child left and I went online, but no one was on till like 9 or something. Went to bed at like 3 so today I slept in muh classes. When I wasn't knocked out I was reading my FFXI Book. Pfffffff not much going on, I just got home and I have to do a report, oh yeah, i'm failing math... that class is gay... Well I think that's all really, trying to figure out a way on getting money...

"event","Basic Human Emotions: 
Anger - A Feeling of undeniable Rage, a mood that occurs when someone you see you don't like, You hear something you don't like, or when something happens to you or Another person you know that shouldn't have.
Joy - When Something good happens to someone this the the usual feeling for the situation. The most pleasant of all the basic emotions.
Sorrow - A state of sulking over something bad that has happened such as a death or a break up. This is the most common emotion among teens and some adults.

        The afore mentioned emotions usually lead to something bigger than the emotion themselves. Example: Sorrow: A deep state of sorrow can evolve in to a mild state of depression at first and continue to grow to a bigger problem. When this happens paranoia may occur to the depressed person.

We all are subjected to all the emotions at one time no matter what, though some are worse than others. These are unavoidable and uncontrollable. They themselves may be the biggest problem in America. There is such thing as to much of a good thing. 

Joy, if you are over joyous you may tend to become a pest and no one wants around due to your positivity, we all need some darker moments though optimism is good some times.

Anger, if you are angry at everything you will be a unsociable person with many more problems due to your social status. We have our angry moments and need to move on with life.

Sorrow, this is obvious, a completly dark person tends to have no intrest for anything at all. No matter how much fun it may be they remain in their state of mind. We all have reasons to sulk and be in a state of sorrow, but those who are always that way need to move on with life, it keeps going so you might as well go with it.

Now i'll admit, i've been in the states mentioned above but I always move on and so can you people. It's not hard to throw a smile on your face may it be real or fake. I fake them a lot to seem like a better person, I don't wanna bring people down with me... That's stupid and causes the problem to spread.


P.s. This is all in boredom. I'll do a real update later."

Anytime I get something good going in my life something seems to kill it... I'm getting into my ""non-talkative"" state again and I'm fucking proud too... Fucking people... A lot of them are assholes and need to fucking die, i'd gladly give them a hand in that... Fags... I hate the feeling of lonelyness... Usually I have someone to help me and hold and all that shit... Not now, although I do care about someone it really can't change some things, like the ability to see her and actually have human contact with her... Well anyways my week has been Ok I guess. I have been playing FFXI a lot, I'm trying to get to lvl 30 before summer but right now it's to get to lvl 20. Well Skool is goin good. I'm studying more and getting better test grades and shit. Like you care though. Mrs.Eye Hates Me like woah. Mission accomplished there. She is very loud... You can hear her from like 3 miles away, and that's her quiet whisper. Shit, I'm listening to a lot more Heavy Metal and shit. I was listening to A Perfect Circle for awhile but then switched to Disturbed and the Old Skool Korn stuff, like the original CD. It's pretty cool. I haven't slept much this week... Like 2 hours a night... pretty shitty, oh well what the fuck do you care about it? Nothing I'm sure. Anyways, I just got home from skool and i'm about to go over to the BK Lounge and chilaxe there (go to Burger King and get some food.) Not Much left to type... I need a GODDAMN hug but I can't ever seem to score one. Also, I'd like a cigarette. I need to not smoke though, I don't very often, like 1 every 2 months but still.... Ok I think that's all I can type for now. I'm gonna get some food. Later bitches.

Yesterday was pretty cool, I slept till 4 Pm and then Played Final Fantasy 11 till 8 and then we went out to eat at Red Lobster. We had to wait like a hour for our food to get done since one of their stoves was fucked up so yeah, we got a free meal. Left a Tip of course but that's it. I was up till 8 Am again last night playing Final Fantasy 11. It's that addictive. Well Nothing going on today, got up at 5 pm and have been watching Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT with my  brother all day so yeah. Pretty good days if you ask me and i'm sure i'll be up till 8 AM again tonight/tomorrow. Well that's all, Happy Jessica, better be lest I have to kill you. Later Bitches."

"event","Ok, I'm gonna update now, Happy Jeshika... Well From the last update on the 30th I dont remember what I did on that day, let alone what day it was.. Oh Wait, it was Tuesday, ok. Well Wednesday I went to skool, blah blah blah, went to first, slept. In second we had a sub (God I hate Subs) and we had a lot of work to do which I didn't finish. 3rd i slept cuz I was tired. 4th I did work and all that and then went home. I got in and sat at the computer and talked to people online and stuff and then my brother walks in the door and hands me Final Fantasy 11 and i'm all ""Holy Shit, You got it!"" I was mucho mucho contento. I installed it and played that for the remained of the day. Thursday was a very gay day. I went to skool and did the same thing as yesterday and came home... Well instead of getting online I had to do 50 note cards for Kosky which sucked because I wanted to get online *sad face*. Well I started to do them and got to about 15 and decided to get online and that's where I quit for awhile, actually more like the whole night lol. I went up to my room and started doing some and got to 27 and went night night. Friday was nerve wrecking since report cards were today and I knew I didn't have good grades. I did my note cards in 2nd period while the rest of the class watched some gay movie. I was like ""I need to pass Kosky, not watch some gay ass movie about abunch of fuckers."" So I did the cards. I got a 45/60 since I didn't have them all... Well in 4th we had a sub... Some old dude... Oh yea, in 1st I slept, you should know that by now people. Anyways, we did some worksheets and then they called us down to get our report cards. I knew what I had so I was ready. I had a:
Classical Films - 89% B from where I missed a test
Spanish 3* - 97% A, Highest grade in the class
World History - 73% D cuz I'm to lazy to work
Geometry - 67% D cuz I hate math and I'm to lazy to work
I know I can do way better than that according to my IQ. I have a 126/140 or something like that so yeah, I'm just way to lazy... So this time around i'm gonna try for better grades. Well thats all, I'm gonna play FFXI here soon so yeah... Later Bitches."

I downloaded them all lol. Well in second I found out I had a 97% A as my final grade. I was like ""WHAT!?!?! NO WAY! Oh Well, I'm gonna go sit my ass down now."" Lol it was great. At Lunch I walked around and hung with my friends as always. I was late for forth again today, I had to go and Annoy Ms. Eye cuz she hates me. I sit at her desk and look through her stuff. She gets mad. Well in forth we did notes and I slept. I came home and laid on the couch and died almost from exhaustion. I was so freaking tired. I got up at 6:30 and my mom brought pizza home. I ate and got online and played Runescape. I had a better day than yesterday. I'm glad that I did cuz I needed it. I still need a good hug though but i'll live so no worries. Well thats all I have really. Oh Yeah, I didn't have to goto Drums tonigh, My Teacher was sick. I was glad about that to kinda cuz I wanted to stay home tonight and rest and play games and shit. I'll get a free session now to, that's what he said atleast so that's cool. Well Now i'm done, since my day was so productive... Right. Later Bitches.

"event","Ok, I just made this journal today, I like it. Well Today was ok... I was still in the same mood as yesterday (A Really depressed mood where I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone and my family hates me) and it's getting to me... I need someone to love, someone to hold on to when I'm like this, someone who thinks i'm the best and praises me, not abuse me ot make fun of me and mean it... I can't take being single anymore, It's an annoyance that I can't rid myself of no matter what I try... I need a hug or something to help me, but no girls want to hug me and I'm not gay (no hetero-hugs either...) I just someone to confide in yet sadly I have no one... Well on with the day. I put on my fake smile to make it seem like I was in a good mood when I wasn't, no need for any of my friends to see me like this. I went to 1st and we watched Finding Nemo and Fighting the Temptations... Better than classic shit... Well In Spanish 3 I have a 85% B in there so I'm glad about that considering I sleep in there and slack off all the time. It's a pretty fun class. Well in Kosky's class they took notes, I slept... We got some work in there that's due Wednesday so I'll do it tomorrow. I don't know what I have in there, I hope a C atleast... If not my mom will kill me... Well In Geometry I have a 67% D in there, thats a big suprise... Not... I hate math and I hate that class more... Fuck math, I don't need most of the shit for anything... Well I came home and I was dead tired, so I started to take a nap but then I got up and played Runescape for awhile since Rs2's full version finally came out. I've been sleeping to much lately, I need this Spring Break and I need it now... I need to get away from school and hang out with friends more. We are all goin camping on a big ole mountain during the break and we are gonna play the Role Playing Game up there. It'll be fun I think and I can't wait. Well I haven't done much today, just talked to people online a lot and that's about it. Well I'm done. Later Bitches."

"event","yeah...last week of school until spring break! um...john is no longer at chandler, but he can graduate sooner at this other school, thats all i want, is for him to graduate and get a good job. just had another fight with my parents last night...well my mom. she says she doesnt care about me and that as soon as im 18 shes gonna kick me out. thats fine by me...ive got better things to do. yeah, um...gilbert tournament was okay, i didnt do storytelling...but i went 2-2 for debate. thats not bad for being gone for 6 weeks. and lauren...gr.. she went 3-1, but 2 of her wins she didnt even really earn. she got a ""by"" round, and then her second round the kid gave up before they started...its not fair, but whatever. i need something to do this weekend, i get so bored. blah blah blah...well im off to school, catcha all laters eh :)"

"event","Okay, well, I've been searching through these big smelly rectangular... things for machina parts, but all I found was trash. Yick, what a stench! I had to bathe for like ten hours to get it out of my hair. ... okay, it didn't take that long, but still, ugh.

But I'm seriously gettin' bored here. No machina to tinker with, no sand to dig... man.

Baralai, what about you? You bored without mountains of papers to sign? I could find you something to do if you want.

I thought one of them 'pika pika' things was speaking Al Bhed at first, but I... er, was mistaken. Hehe."

"event","Man, this place is so punehk! There's absolutely nothing to do. No machina to tinker with, just this communicator thingamajig I salvaged a little bit ago. It's pretty neat, if old as sin. Er. Whatever.

In any case, I wandered way far away from where I last saw Djose and... now I'm lost. Baralai's the navigator, not me, plus it's pretty hard to tell directions when 1, you have one eye, 2, you lack a compass, 3, you're as bad with direction as I am. Damn, I wish I hadn't chucked the compass Noojster gave me during our training.

Speaking of which, Yuna of the GULLWINGS <small>(there, I acknowledged your supreme change)</small> has been worrying way too much about Cid's Girl and Paine. Paine kicks serious ass and Cid's Girl can watch hers well enough. I mean who *can't* see that ass?"

"event","So, it's my birthday. My 38th birthday. <br /><br /><img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2763/4273361264_05a215c485.jpg"" alt=""Me. 37.5"" /><br /><br />This is a few months ago, but you get the idea. The last few years have been absolutely amazing. For those of you not following my other blog, this is my pat-myself-on-the-back post for the year :-)&nbsp; Here goes:<br /><br />-I have an amazing partner. We've weather many storms, and things are truly spectacular. We have so much in common, we're more committed with each day. We've had to work very, very hard to get here, but it's been worth it. I&nbsp;love him.<br /><br />-I&nbsp;still live in heaven. No, really. I&nbsp;can see mountains almost everywhere I&nbsp;go. It's incredible. I&nbsp;get to hike, hunt wild foods and mushrooms, see bears, and all kinds of other fun things on a regular basis. I look out onto a river every day when I walk out onto my front porch. <br /><br />-Business is booming! My Personal Chef clients are wonderful, and I am fortunate that they enjoy my services. I get to do nutrition counseling, as well!<br /><br />-I've taught at an Internationally-known MacArthuer Foundation Award winning urban agriculture organization, and I've just been asked to teach and present at their annual conference.Yes, paid. How cool is that?<br /><br />-I've got fabulous friends--those who I've known for many years, and those who I&nbsp;am still getting to know.<br /><br />-Local food is my main diet: meat, dairy (raw milk, yay!!!), produce, fruit, even fish. Soon, legumes and grains will be added to that. I&nbsp;get to play on farms, keep in touch with my farm-girl roots, and play with goats :-)<br /><br />-I&nbsp;am in the best shape of my life. In addition to hiking and generally being active, I teach spin, p90x, yoga, and some other stuff. I swim regularly. I look awesome in a bikini. I&nbsp;love how I&nbsp;feel--strong, energetic--and how I&nbsp;look. I&nbsp;get guessed at 24-27 by strangers. Thank you, grams, for the genetics!<br /><br />-I am still a total nerd. Sci-fi books and movies, podcasts, RPGs, and even food. Total. Nerd. <br /><br />-My kitties are doing well. I&nbsp;suppose they're &quot;middle-aged&quot; now, but they love where we live (lots of windows and birds!), and spend a lot of time happily chasing ghosts.<br /><br />-I get to volunteer with urban and at-risk youth, teaching them cooking and nutrition. I&nbsp;love watching their faces light up as they eat good, wholesome food they've prepared.<br /><br />So, what's bad?&nbsp;There's always negative things in life: my grandparents are aging, and there's a lot that goes along with that, most of it difficult and stressful for everyone involved. But, they love me, and I love them, and I&nbsp;still have them to love, and that's what's important. I&nbsp;miss my friends in MI, but I&nbsp;do still get to see them once in a while. Not as often as I'd like, but courtesy of the internet, it's pretty easy to keep in touch. I haven't won the lottery; but, since I&nbsp;don't play, I&nbsp;can't say that's totally unexpected.<br /><br />The good outweighs the bad, by a lot. I never thought I'd be here, even though Patrick assured me that everything would change after I&nbsp;hit 35. He was right: a place I&nbsp;love, doing something I&nbsp;love, and doing well at it. It's been a good year. I&nbsp;am looking forward to 38. <br />"

"event","Or whatever it is you like most. Yes, another update post on here, per request.

If things were any more full of sun and happiness, I'd have to wear sunblock to bed. Seriously, it's weird. I know, I know. Gift horse, mouth, etc. So, I'll just make it quick.

I am going to be working with the American Red Cross starting in July. I'll be formulating menus to help low-income people receiving commodities use the items they get each month. Most of the time, these ingredients are kind of off-beat, or they need to be really stretched. I'll be including recipes, and a shopping list for the additional items needed to complete the recipes. The shopping list will include prices, and I'm keeping each meal under $1 per person with the goal of making each meal nutritionally balanced. It'll be a challenge, but I'm really excited about it. I'll also be doing food, shopping, and nutritional counseling for individuals. I've wanted to have the time and resources to do this kind of volunteer work for a long time, and now I do. 

I was contacted by a gentleman putting together an eco-friendly restaurant (he already runs a few other restaurants in the area) who wants me to head up the recipe development and design. The food will be all-local, all sustainable, and apparently my name is The One that kept coming up. This is so gratifying! I bounced the idea of brining 1-2 other people on-board to work as part of a team, as I have *no* experience in actual restaurant menu design, and I got the go for that idea. So, this week, I am talking to the person I'd really hoped would be interested (and he is!!!) to put together a proposal. Also, if all goes well, I am hoping my lovely Laurel and good friend H. might be wiling to come on board at least a bit, too. 

In less detailed blurbs:
-I have a new client: a local doctor who wants to eat better. She's fantastic.

-I have a new grass-fed, pastured beef producer. I finished that interview today, and I'll be trying product this weekend. Their practices are spot-on and innovative, and also as close to fuel-less as possible (you can't slaughter beef on your own farm if it's for sale, so they do have to transport it to the slaughter house/butcher).

-I am training HARD, burning between 400-1000 calories a day 5 days a week (depends on which training day it is). I am also back to using the website I LOVE to help calculate what I need to be eating, because I can tell I am down on protein. I went lap swimming in open water for the first time yesterday, and loved it. But, I got my butt kicked and will need a lot of practice before I am ready for the races. 

-I am hoping to be able to do a 4K for cancer at the end of August, which I'll be dedicating to one of my clients. She's fighting a rare and very aggressive form of breast cancer, and&nbsp; has an amazing spirit and will. I am in shape enough to do it now, but I am working on my knees. I can't afford to blow them out, so wish me luck on getting them to a point I can do the run!

-The weather is frickin' astonishing, we're hiking, and we love it here. We found this amazing swimming hole in a mountain stream at the foot of a waterfall, complete with rocks perfect for diving and sunbathing. It's cool there even on the hottest days, and looks like a movie set. 

So, pass me that 70spf and some shades. I need them."

"event","It's been just over a year since Things Happened, part 1. While Parts 2-? still have upcoming anti-versaries in May, I thought I'd post where I'm at now. <br /><br />I don't post here regularly, and I am not going to start again; but, this seemed like a good time to revisit some things. And yes, this is a very ""me"" oriented post.<br /><br />In no particular order:<br /><br />-I am 100% self-employed. I have a career that I love, running (and making a good living at) a business and two halves that are fantastic. First, of course, I am now officially a Personal Chef. As in, I have clients. I love what I do, it makes a difference. Example: I am cooking for an oncology patient (very aggressive cancer), and the food choices I make are part of her treatment. They can make a notable difference in her well-being, and therefore that of her family. It takes some stress off of her already stressful situation, and that makes me feel good. And I get paid for it! I also still have the henna business, of course (which is one ""half"" of a business since I've ratcheted it down to gigs I feel like taking). And, I now have another ""half business"":<br /><br />-I am doing the purchasing, events, and design for a local, very high-end gourmet store's cheese division. What does this mean in layman's terms? I get to go to dairies, taste cheese, buy it and sell it, and create catering plates using other local ingredients from farms I also get to visit. AND I GET PAID FOR THIS! With, in the near future, profit sharing. I am getting paid to eat and talk about cheese. I don't think a more perfect job exists. <br /><br />-I am in fantastic shape, better than I've been in since probably my early 20's. I am 105 lbs, mostly muscle, with lungs like bellows. Oh, yeah! I am finally, it appears, side effects from the whole MI thing, as is Tiri (no permanent brain or lung damage for her, either, thankfully).<br /><br />-We've got two National Park trails that we oversee. We got into the group because we hike so much we felt we should give back, and it's also meant meeting a lot of great people. Soon, we were given a trail of our own and then another. Essentially, overseeing is keeping it passable and free of debris. We do the blazing (marks you follow so you don't get lost), blow down removals, trim backs, waste pick up, etc. We get to hike while we volunteer. How cool is that? We're also looking at joining the restoration/construction crew for some of the AT and just-off-AT cabins!<br /><br />-Our place is amazing. It's got more light than anyplace I've ever lived, with windows *everywhere*!&nbsp; It's a historic building with 12 foot ceilings, archways, and all the little nooks, crannies, and eccentricities one could ask for. It's also very large, with about 1200 sq. ft. of usable living space, including a nicely sized kitchen. We have a balcony, a flowering tree out or (full-sized) dining room window, and my cats love it. I even have my own little home-office space! And, it's really nice to finally not be sick anymore.<br /><br />-I love who I am: beautiful inside and out, sweet and kind, caring and empathetic, funny, passionate, and gregarious. And, I have self-respect, which often seems in short supply among women these days (a very sad state of things). <br /><br />-I DO stuff. I spent a week in CA, including several days in Yosemite National Park (oh, the pictures of waterfalls--you're all very lucky you're not here for the slideshow!). We're taking a 3-day canoe trip down my favorite river. I spent Sunday climbing waterfalls (not around them, through and up them), and came home bruised, battered, and very happy. Friday,&nbsp; i am going morel hunting, and this Sunday is a large Hunt Party we're attending with friends. Tall and Lanky is kayaking regularly with a few of the guys down here. <br /><br />-Tall &amp; Lanky and I are doing great. He continues to make progress in where he is going and what he is doing (that is his story to tell), and it shows more every day. We are more in love than ever, more committed than ever, and the relationship is healthier than ever in so many ways. We do so much together, and it's sometimes startling how much we have in common. <br /><br />-I've developed more new interests this past year (yeah, I know, like I needed anymore): podcasts and bento being the major new additions. I still read, I am still very active (moreso even) in the slow &amp; local sustainable foods movements, I still love the cheese, etc. I am just time managing better, and picking and choosing.<br /><br />Life is good. I didn't allow it to be destroyed by others, and I <i>am </i>worth everything it's taken. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><font size=""1""><br />*I am sorry, Jared Axelrod, I was inspired specifically by your site and the title just fit so darn well.

"event","For those who've asked:

--If all goes as planned, I will be leaving the week of July 23rd. If I could swing it, I'd leave earlier, given the situation. I need to move, I need to get to a place where I can breathe again and start a life for myself. I'll be staying with a friend for the first few weeks while I look into housing options. Ideally, I'd like a mother-in-law apartment in an older home, or something along those lines. I'd also consider a trade for services with personal cheffing, if there was someone who was interested. We'll see.

-Tiri is doing great.

-My toe is broken. According to the doc, who unfortunately spent more time flirting with me than examining my x-rays, pretty nastily. It got turned. Fun. 4-6 weeks. They also gave me this lovely sandal. Which is an awful lot like the sandals I wore in, except ugly. And less supportive. And it rubs the skin off. So, I'll continue with the barefoot thing, thanks.

-Overall, I am surviving. Mostly, I am spending time trying not to sleep all day. Yes, I realize that is a symptom of depression; but, with a broken toe that hurts like hell, there's a limited amount of energy expending I can do anyway for at least a week or two more while it heals sufficiently for me to wear closed-toed shoes (and therefore, trainers so I can do cardio and weights again). Swimming, however, is something I should start up again. Fortunately, I am good at it and enjoy it. But, I also enjoy sleep, and it's so much easier.

-Still have the serious hipbones, still not put back on the weight I lost through all this. I am eating better again, though.

I guess that about sums it up."

"event","So far, cutting the simple starches out of the diet for a couple of weeks is going really well. I did have two squares of chocolate last night, to salve the intense stress of the day. A good bit of that stress didn't come to any kind of conclusion until this morning, when I took Tiri to the vet. She's fine, and I am treating her for her stomach issues, but I was so worried at the constant vomiting I couldn't sleep. She actually came upstairs last night to get me, and so I went downstairs to sleep with her (she won't sleep upstairs if she's sick, if the windows are open downstairs, or if there's someone else in the bed). She was on and off the couch all night, intermittently puking. She got to the point she'd sit next to the couch so I didn't have to get up to reach out and hold her while she was retching. It was heart-rending. It did stop once i took food and water away, which helped. She was starving and thirsty (no, she wasn't terribly dehydrated by any means, but she was trying to clear her system), so she kept trying to ingest things that kept coming back up.<br /><br />I knew it wasn't poison, etc. because she was very bright-eyed and bushy tailed, no fever, clear-eyed, lucid, etc. I had a good idea of what it was, and I was basically right. Logically, I knew she'd be fine until morning. Emotionally, I couldn't go to sleep. She got in first thing this morning, and it's her digestive system acting up again. Doc recommended some new, simple measures to help stave this off if it happens again (this is the second time), and Tiri is doing better now. She's eating, and has kept it down. Yay!<br /><br />In other news, I had two of my favorite things today: a ripe, juicy nectarine and a ripe banana with peanut butter. Little bits of heaven.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""What I've been doing"">YESTERDAY: <br /><br />Food--Breakfast: fermented oatmeal w/strawberries and molasses. Lunch: bowl of organic cereal. Dinner: fresh salad w/tomatoes and grated mozzarella, minestrone soup w/parmesan, and vegetable-smoked sausage gratin. snack: two squares of chocolate sliced cheese, sliced nectarine, sunflower seeds.<br /><br />Did: coffee w/friend. Top of the Park in the evening. Scrabble. Tended kitty.<br /><br />Supplements: usual.<br /><br />TODAY:<br /><br />Food--Breakfast: bowl of organic cereal. Lunch: leftover gratin.

Unf, my damn toe is hurting pretty badly, so not at all sure how if I'll get in the regular amount of cardio. Might swim instead.<br /><br />Accomplished: 2 hours in the car w/kitty (our vet is SO worth the trip--both in efficacy and cost). Started cleaning deck. Opened house. Managed not to nap despite getting like 2 hours of sleep.<br /><br /></div>"

"event","So, I was out buying a couple groceries yesterday: eggs, bread, and fresh fruit at Kroger. Most of what Kroger had were the expensive, organic fruits--things about 1.5 to three times the price of regular fruit. It's clear that in the very near future, all of their produce will be organic.

Now, I do as much as I reasonably can for my nutrition and the environment. I buy organic whenever reasonable; but, no everyone can. Hell, at this point, I certainly can't eat organic even most of the time. This Kroger is literally the only option some people have for groceries--anyone without a car is forced to shop there if they want to eat. There is no bus service to speak of. People who can't afford a car almost certainly cannot afford organic fruit, so they are left with either canned or nothing. 

Food prices are already on the rise due to fuel prices, and many, many people can't afford to eat even regular fresh fruits and vegetables on a regular basis. What the hell are they supposed to do when all they have the option to buy is super-expensive organic?

Yes, I get that organic is better for the environment. Of course I'd prefer to eat organic all the time. Unfortunately, I live in the real world where the economy currently dictates that I better learn to like ""regular"" bananas and strawberries most of the time. Have you *seen* Thudd? This man eats 3,000+ calories a day to just maintain weight, and we can't afford 3,000 calories a day in organic food. And if we can't, I can only imagine what kind of food many of the people around that store are now eating, since they can no longer afford to buy most of the fresh fruits.

We bitch about obesity in this country. It's now classified as a disease. I think it's a symptom. It's getting more and more difficult for lower and middle class people to purchase a healthy diet, especially for families. Organic is a generally good concept (with some major kinks to be worked out yet), and I'd love to see everyone eating organic and free range foods. More than that, though, I'd love to see people who aren't in the upper echelon have reasonable, fresh choices AT ALL for their diet.

I left the organic strawberries at the store."

"event","Much family and road-tripping was had this weekend. Family was visited, nephews were chastised. There were pool fights with foamy swords where I realized that being a good swimmer was sometimes better than being any one of three guys bigger than me. Lots of car time. One trigger was breathed through. And, a gig was canceled. In other words, aside from that really crappy last thing, it was great.

This week is yard work and getting our deck in some kind of usable condition (large stove-like items were gotten rid of last week), some rewiring, beginning to pack not-oft-used items for the move, two gigs on Friday, Scrabble, and hopefully some time with friends. There will be daily gym visits this week, as well.

Also starting this weeks is the low-starches &amp; sugars thing for two weeks. Not atkins or anything, just switching to many more complex carbs, because I have been CRAVING potatoes and sweets since I started eating regularly again. My body is craving calories, and therefore lots of things Bad for Me. So, this is an attempt to mitigate that by eating enough without eating crap--I look amazing in my bikini, and would like to stay that way. I was fine before the not-eating thing, but I am sure that my metabolism is a bit off from it, and so eating lots of empty calories is likely to put on more than I want to gain back. Tonight is grilled chicken with my homemade coffee b-b- q rub, stewed garbanzo beans, mixed green veggies (edamame, green beans, spinach), and vegetable brown rice."

It's not like I am overweight, or overeating (though Heather &amp; Zac brought over wonderful brownies for dessert last night!). I do get exercise. I am going walking--yes, on the broken toe--later today (going w/a friend to feed the birds at Kensington: they sit on your hands and eat, which if fun. I've been doing this for over 10 years, and it's always still a neat experience).

So, what is my deal? I have hip flexors and good arms, and i am not actually eating enough to gain weight. Actually, I have to be careful about losing it. 

I need to stop obsessing. Maybe it's because it's something I have immediate control over, when so much of my life is spinning in fast circles around me as the move approaches? Or, maybe it's because I am sitting home on my arse during the week right now."

All these words describe my smallest toe on my left foot. Another way to describe it would be ""broken.""

This happened yesterday, because I (of course) have a walked event to go to today. In good news, I have vicodin and a Thadd that willingly gave up his day to come help me gimp around with all my friends (and some of his). I suspect my clumsiness--and that's exactly what it was--is due mostly to extreme fatigue and stress. Oh, and lack of food. I am not sure how much I've lost, but my stomach is concave at this point, and my hipbones are pretty serious weapons. I am somewhere at or under 100 lbs, and I should probably give up and weight myself on the gym's scale. Maybe it would give me impetus to eat. On the other hand, while I was certainly not fat to begin with, I look good.*shrugs*

The look for apartments/houses in VA begins in earnest this coming week. I'll be searching for places from here, and our friends in the area will help us with on-site stuff. I'll head over there when we find something promising to check things out, sign leases, etc.

We've been planing the move for so long, it seems surreal that it's already the middle of June. How did that happen? I've considered just taking out a loan and moving sooner, because the economy isn't supporting me right now and it's becoming a HUGE problem. If I find something sooner, it's actually an option I am entertaining. Either way, we're still planning to be off by mid- to late August. Thank all of you for bearing with us these many months of whining, complaining, and bitching while the move was planned (yeah, I know the planning started last year).

And now, off to tape my toe... Oh, and to have Bloody Marys and breakfast with our neighbors, who are almost twice our age and cooler than we are by more than I can readily admit."

It wasn't as long as I often do; but, while the cardio was a bit shorter, it was also a consistent 165 heart rate. For me, that's a pretty good clip to run for that long as I am pretty fit. I needed the stress relief, though, and feel better for it today. It was swimming and hot tub after that, followed by a thudd-cooked dinner and a night of decadent delights. We put together a cheese &amp; stuff tray (cheese, apples, crackers, grape tomatoes, baby carrots, etc.), and I made AMAZING bruschetta (swiss &amp; cream cheeses combined with home-roasted garlic on thudd's homemade ciabatta, topped with diced tomatoes--then broiled to perfection. Partnered with a red shiraz and fantastic chocolate, it all made a great night to stay home and watch MythBusters.

Oh, and play Scrabble. Courtesy of ritchi_dagger and his lovely wife's enthusiasm for the game, Thudd and I decided to give it a whorl for evenings we didn't want to go out. Last night was wet and crappy, and inside it was cozy with kitties and food, so we played. I won 371 to 271,&nbsp; We're going to continue round two tonight, but I believe Thudd is up on me by a bit.

Today, we tried to geocache, and got rained on. And I don't mean a little rain. Large drops of rain in torrents poured down on us as we wandered from the river back to the car, and it was wonderful. We didn't bother running, we just walked and enjoyed the feeling of the cool rain completely soaking us in the heat. Fortunately, I look good wet :-) Unfortunately, we didn't find the cache, but that just means we'll be headed out again tomorrow to give it a go. Thudd and Monkey headed to the gym, but I elected to stay home. I'll be headed there again tomorrow, and I am still not eating as well as I should; so, I thought rest day was in order. I am not sure what my weight is, but my size 1's are loose. I really don't want to lose any more weight, though the upshot of all this is that the few bits of me that weren't responding as quickly to toning as others are now nicely cut.&nbsp; Instead, I'm snuggling with the kitties &amp; a good book.

I took my vitamins, I am drinking water, and eating some wonderful soup. Tomorrow is asian salmon, tuesday is homemade chicken ravioli, and Weds. is cajun grilled steak. Later this week I'll be meeting with Meg, and also waterfarie. And of course the gym, and work. I'd like to make time to go collect some more wild foods, but we'll see if it happens."

"event","It's been a really, amazingly, unspeakably difficult and horrible month. Really. I knew ahead of time time that last night was going to suck worse than some of the preceding days, and realized I'd had *no* downtime. No time to relax and be in my own head-space. So, I decided to make it about me.<br /><br />I went hiking. In the rain. It was amazing.<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Cut for pictures..."">It rained on and off the entire time I was in the woods. My pants clung to my ankles, my shoes squelched, my hair was plastered to my head under my very-wet hat, and my North Face wind breaker stuck to my arms. It was everything I wanted. There were birds everywhere, including the fairly rare bluebird. Yellow finches fluttered all around me. I startled a deer, who came at me before realizing she was going the wrong way. We looked at one another in the eye for a few seconds and she sauntered off in another direction. The slinking shadow that sped away as I neared the May Apple thicket was a fox, who turned to look at me from the rise when she was safely out of my reach. The chipmunk skittered, and the slugs slowly wandered up to see if I was edible, and the frogs leaped a bit slower than usual.<br /><br />And the rain. The rain was steady, and somehow cleansing. I felt it wash over me, cooling my face and rinsing away some--just a bit, but still some--of the incredible negativity that has haunted me these past weeks. It was as though the heavens parted for me, taking away some small part of the pain and soaking it into the ground where it was diluted and would do less harm. There was only me for that brief several hours, a quiet in my head and heart that I'd forgotten.<br /><br />There was a grove of honeysuckle by a red-wing-blackbird infested marsh, where the smell intoxicated me and the sounds tinkled in my head, drowning out the noise of my thoughts. I sat there, in the wet grass, for....I don't even know how long. A long time. I didn't want to leave. There are moments that I am still not sure why I did.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/193/502093008_9c67d0a7a5.jpg?v=0"" /><br />White honeysuckle.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/218/502092746_8ab0a0fe79.jpg?v=0"" /><br />pink honeysuckle<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/199/502129789_24442fdeb6.jpg?v=0"" /><br />Trillium<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/205/502129853_c717a9299c.jpg?v=0"" /><br />Shelf mushrooms on bark<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/217/502092920_3f66e47674.jpg?v=0"" /><br />Tiny, inedible mushroom<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/203/502092876_110ffe1c4c.jpg?v=0"" /><br />Larger inedible mushroom<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/231/502092902_5f3f4aa819.jpg?v=0"" /><br />May Apple flower<br /><br />I didn't find any morels, and I may be the only person in the world who can't find them for some reason--I certainly find all the other mushrooms, edible or otherwise--but I really didn't care.

"event","About a month ago, I did a henna gig for Macomb Community College. My check was supposed to be handed to me immediately upon completion of the gig, which is pretty much SOP for colleges. I did the gig, only to find out afterwards that there was no check. The coordinator said the accounting department simply hadn't had time to cut it, since my hire was last minute, but that I'd have it by the end of the week (the gig was on a Tuesday). At the very latest by the end of the following week, but she doubted it would take even that long Fine. End of week, no check. Early the next week, I get an email saying they need a W-9 filled out, which I do and then fax it back. Apparently, they couldn't hand that to us AT THE DAMN EVENT (other entertainers were included on the email).

The end of *that* week, the week I was promised absolutely no later than, goes by. No check. Beginning of the following week, I call, and politely remind them to pay me. The coordinator says she went over personally and it would be sent out the next day. A week later, still no check. Beginning of last week, I call and email, saying I still have rec'd no check. No word back until the check arrives on the 12th, having been cut literally the day before.

It was made out wrong. So wrong, in fact, I cannot cash it.

Despite the fact that it says how to make it out very clearly, and in bold print, on my contract. So far, no one has returned my calls or emails about this. It is to the point that I am going to have to start turning down college gigs completely unless they send me the money before the event, or have it ready when I walk in. MSU has been horrible about paying me the last couple of gigs, even though they still want to hire me for more. Apparently, no one thinks that several hundred dollars is something that I should be peeved about them breeching contract for.

To make this even better, I called my part-time waitressing job to ask if I could come in and get my check on Sunday or today, at which time I was told there'd been no check cut, even though I've worked there for THREE WEEKS. When I started, I was told I came in the middle of the pay period, and so it'd be the next pay period (this past Friday) before I'd get my check. The weekend/night manager answered, and said that he was the one to do checks, and there'd been no check information for me. I'd have to call my day manager or talk to her when I came into work, to which I replied that I wouldn't be working until I got a paycheck. I know it's only $150 or so after taxes because I am a waitress, but right now that is a pretty big damn deal to me. Especially since it's THREE WEEKS worth of pay, and there were a few days I did NOT make at least minimum wage in tips because we were so slow. And especially since the bar takes THIRTY PERCENT of my tips. I called, and the manager was ""busy."" I am giving her a chance to call back, but I suspect I may need to go in tomorrow and be a raging bitch. Which could be fun, since I really kind of need an outlet for that right now.

What the F*CK is with people thinking that paying me is optional? I am pretty clear about the expectation of wages (and when and how they are to be paid) when I take a gig or&nbsp; start a job, and last I checked it was standard practice to pay your employees; so, I don't think I am being irrational to expect my damn pay. Currently, there is something like $500 or so dollars floating in the Shawn's Money People Seem to Think They Can Keep ether."

MUCH fun, and I got a novel for a DOLLAR. I am going back here as often as possible. Like second-hand clothing stores, this feeds into my idea of an ""okay"" luxury. At $1-4 each, I can buy all the books I want and not feel guilty about it.<br /><br />Also, an addition to my last post about the weekend, Thudd and I were out hunting wild foods, and this year is going to be amazing. We found THE place for puffball mushrooms when they start coming in--I may even have fungus to share this year! We also found what promises to be a huge patch of milkweed, and a ton of cattails (one of the best wild food sources available). Thudd wants to try the flour that can be gotten from catttails pollen, and i want to try the seedpods cooked like corn. There was a downside to this, though. You see, a lot of wild plants look strikingly similar, with one being edible and the other being poisonous. We had to do some actual taste-testing to determine which variety of plant we'd found, and we'd found the poisonous one. Sweetflag, a highly edible plant, looks a lot like an iris that isn't. The iris that isn't, unfortunately, leaves your mouth on fire for--as we found out--the rest of the day. No amount of milk, bread, water, etc. will quench the fire in the back of your throat and sinuses. It just has to go away on it's own (which, thankfully, it finally did). You'd think something like that would also burn any infection out of your sinuses, right? Nope. Lesson learned."

I made a salad of harvested dandelion greens, along with dandelion-flower fritters; but, I didn't get any pics. I also boiled up a few mulberry shoots to try, and wow, tasty!!

I also found, unfortunately, that the lid to my mini food processor is still MIA.

We all have stuff to get rid of, including clothes, shoes, knick-knacks, and lord only knows what else. I'll announce the date sometime next week, along with a running list of the larger items. SCA clothing is also a very distinct possibility.<br /><br />Back to the cupboards... I tossed a bunch of Gladware lids that I no longer had tubs for. How do I always end up with a ton of lids and no tubs? Is there a Gladware Tub Gnome, employed by Glad, that steals your tubs so you have to buy new sets? Will they all be found someday along with single socks and ball-point pens? Regardless, the lids weren't doing me any good; so, out they went. I found all my bento stuff, much of which I gave up on gathering together last week, and put it all into one place. Yay, I can start doing Bentos again! <br /><br />The rest of the day is being spent checking out henna venues, and probably going to the gym. I'll have to go light on that given my current lack of caloric intake, but I seriously need to go. I've not been since we went to VA for a variety of reasons (and by reasons, I mean excuses).

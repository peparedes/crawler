"event","Nyah. I am extremely bored. There's nothing on TV, which I don't watch any way.. but hey. S'okay.

My brother is obsessing over the god damn video game systems. I can't even get 5 minutes to play.. and when I do, he goes and tells my mom that I've had it ""ALL DAAAY!!"" and then I get bumped off. One day I'm just gonna slice his little throat. Nobody'll notice.

Whoo. Demonwood is actually shaping up some. I just finished three levels additional, for a total of four. I drew the kindoworl picture, and added a bow maintainer so that you cannot shoot without a bow. So if you don't have a bow, it takes your arrows.

Uhm. Blah.

And for another public service announcement. Jeff is a faggat and Laura is a dyke. I never get tired of hating them. I can see how their relationship works, though. Laura likes women, and Jeff is overly feminine. Jeff likes men, and Laura is overly butch. So therefore, they are attracted to each other because they have the traits that each one is looking for. It's a cross-homo relationship. It works like a normal relationship, each person likes the qualities in the other, and therefore they like each other. Except this is just reversed. Although, being homosexual they shouldn't be allowed existence anyway.. but hell. I think God just has a sense of humor.

Another theory is that they both want to look straight, so they pretend to be in some kind of relationship. It's like if you want to look like a good soccer player, you go into the game and look like you're doing something, whether you really are or not. Someone uninitiated to you would think ""Well, there goes a nice soccer player"" even though you really, really suck. This applies in that  since at first sight they don't always appear gay, you would think ""oh well that's a nice couple"" and don't even think about the fact they are, in truth, homosexual, and only using each other as a social crutch.

While we're on social crutches, now then...

I've noticed that a lot of people I know overly use things like sickness, betrayal, and other bad things that could happen to them as a social crutch. I've even seen some low self-esteem thrown in there, that isn't really that true. You can kinda tell when somebody's faking about not liking themselves. I don't like it when people use those kinds of things, and MOST of the time I try to point it out.

And on the case of saying ""sorry"" for no reason: It's gay. Just because you're talking and I'm not saying anything dosn't mean you have to say sorry. Or to anyone else for that matter. It makes you look weak, and when you look weak, regardless of what ""shining"" personality the person may have, they'll notice it, and start expecting it, thinking that they really are better than you, when in truth, they are the weaker person. 'Cept in my case. Appologizing too much just pisses me off.

"event","Do you mortals out there like Puzzle-ee games? The one that I am working on for ZIG, called Falcon Sword Legend, is very nice. The castle has two floors. Before you say boring, it has a large fuckload of stuff to do. Some of these things you will have to take a break and come back to before you can realize what you must do. I have a firm belief that the story is intersting, although not in depth, it is still rather amusing. You are Jace, and you must ""adventure"" through a strange, old castle to find the Falcon Sword. The Falcon Sword grants any wish, but there is a rumor that it only grants eternal life. Anyway, to prove either side, you go to find it. On the first floor you must traverse the castle, opening doors and solving puzzles, when you find out about a ""love story"" of sorts between the princess of the castle and a soldier. When you go downstairs into the second level, you find another letter, this time it's the EXECUTION ORDER of the soldier that was in love with the princess. This triggers the event that when you go into the ballroom, you have to fight the demon spirit of a conglomerate between the princess and the soldier. Whoo. And then you get another puzzle item, and then you go and solve the puzzle, and find the sword. Whoo.

You know what's cool? The entire game is 5 boards. For any of you initiated to Megazeux or ZZT, you know what a board is. Well, in ZIG, boards get extremely large (my floors are 300x200), so I am able to put one floor/board. Why still 5 boards, then? Well duh. The title screen, introduction, and winning screen. Duh. Originally, you could get tired and hungry, both of which end your adventure, but those were taken out. I'm also thinking about taking out combat that's non-puzzle... But maybe not. I don't want your opinions, so don't bother posting. I won't read them."

My mind is swirling very fast lately. My thought capability has suddenly ramped, and I feel smart again, like I did in elementary school.

Recently an MZXer named Akwende posted about the ability to create and render a 3d voxel engine, like the one in doom or wolf3d. Hopefully, he goes through with it. But just in case, I have been studying Voxels, which are <B>VO</b>lumetric Pi<b>xels</b>, and the ways they are used today. I came to the conclusion that Voxels when used alone in floating point numbers are extremely slow. So to speed this up, you must use Fixed-Point numbers. That increases speed a lot, but the engine all together is slow. Then I agree with Akwende, as he says that page flipping will increase the framerate by a large amount. I am tinkering with this idea.. I may have something soon. I just hope AK's voxel engine is faster than his Airship Voxel engine, which sucked big floppy donkey balls.

My engine will be very nice, indeed. The first thing I will probably make with it would be a very nice fantasy first person shooter. Sorta like Enclave for the XBOX, just less prettier and dosn't have hit-sensitivity on the level Enclave does, where having 400 point armor means nothing when you are hit in the neck. Should be very interesting indeed. If you have ideas for it, feel free to comment. You might even get a nice spot in the credits."

2. Must be interested in computers. Whether it be programming/talking/doingstuff
3. Must be able to sway. I don't know why, but this is important to me. Now go away.
4. She has to be able to argue right. If you can't argue right you don't have a purpose.      By argue right I mean no cutting each other down, and no false points. And keep      cussing to a minimum.
5. Outside of argument, she has to be able to curse right. If you go around saying fuck      cuz it sounds pretty that ain't right.
6. Has to just want to talk. Talking is important. and I cna fxi yer gmaes.

No, I don't have a specific on how she has to look. Personally, I don't really care. She just has to be within 5 inches of height. I'de be more willing to date someone 5'3"" than 6'2"" (me being 5'0"")

Either those fuckers who don't like it are to busy tongueing there ass and are too scared to say anythiing, or I'm amazingly popular. I even found myself linked to someone I don't even know. S'funny. Hwah hwah hwah hwah!!

I programmed a giant fish for ""Shilling the Pinecone Fuck"". It has a cock. But justin covers it up by saying it's a FIN. YES MOMMY THAT'S A *FIN*. Personally I don't know why he adds cocks to fishes. Expecially a fish named Mr. Bass. But you do get to go in a dungeon AND even so koolness things like witnessing a cow steal a giant fucking smiley face statue.

Gwah hwah hwah hwah!! I like gmaes. Gmaes are cooler than Games for one reason: they're more fun. Would you rather be a handsome hero fighting the bad guy to save the world, and end up getting the girl and having all such good lifeyness, and have to uphold the good in everything, or would you rather be a dumbfuck squirrell thingy named Panky doing whatever the fuck you want, be it saving the town or fucking a water buffalo?

On worldly news, I just read an old article about a man who had to be surgically removed from a sheep. Seems he decided to ""Get Some"" from the sheep, and as you may know, when it comes time for the sheep to reproduce the muscles contract and the guy's genital was stuck in the sheep. He took himself to the emergency room where he was extracted, and the sheep was not harmed.

THAT'S WHAT YA GET FOR BONIN' A GOD DAMN SHEEP!!! Bwah hah hah hah!!

Shilling the Pinecone Fuck is near completion people, stay tuned for more info."

"event","I'm back. Yes, AGAIN. No, you can't get rid of me. I have decided to write a pencil and paper RPG for you right here right now. You may want to play this, or not. But it is cool and stuff. 

First you pick the homo or elite person you want to play!!

Jeff - Pacifist Feminine Male - Homo
Hp: 3
Attack: 0
Defense: 10
Intelligence: 0
Speed: 10

Laura - Butch Dyke - Homo
Hp: 5
Attack: 7
Defense: 7
Intelligence: 3
Speed: 3

Dave - Killer Southern Son of a Bitch (gets a dual attack bonus 50%) - SuperElite
Hp: 15
Attack: 7
Defense: 6
Intelligence: 4
Speed: 3

Liz - HappyHappyFunPerson (gets insanityfun bonus 50%) - Elite
Hp: 12
Attack: 3
Defense: 8
Intelligence 7
Speed: 2

Justin - Fighting Ass Hole (gets critical asshit 50%) - Elite
Hp: 10
Attack: 9
Defense: 7
Intelligence: 1
Speed: 3

Now, you learn to play.

To attack, you just subtract the opposition's defense from the attack number. Which means Liz and Jeff almost never hit for damage.

To defend, do the opposite, which means almost nobody here takes a whole lot of damage.

To use a ""fagnique"" or ""magic"" you add it's attack to intelligence and that's the attack damage. Then subtract the defense from it and bang.

Now, you pick your techniques. Pick 3

Homos must use Fagniques
Elites must use magic

Fagniques

Buttfuck - 1
DoubleAssFuck - 4
Asstongue - 9

Magics

ShadowWalker - Enemy dosn't hit for three turns
BitchSlap - 4
Youjustateshit - 19 (must have ""shit"" in possesion)

Now, you make your quest. For your first time playing, why don't you use this quest module below:

""DamN""

In ""DamN"" your team must go to jeff and laura's houses and kill them in their parents. Even if they are on your team. Why? Of course you can figure this one out. But, along the way you must fight Liz's Mom, and the DarkrMention. ""Shit"" is very common in this one, as are the monsters ""Gaywad"" and ""FudgePacker"". Both have 20 hp and zero stats.

Liz's Mom has 50 hp and 7 attack.
and the jeff and laura types, parents included are same as above listed.

Have fun, and you can't tell your parents, certain people, because this is opinion and opinion cannot be prosecuted."

"event","Damnit damnit damnit I need to update this thing more. I've been gone way to long and now ""I'm baaack agaaiiiinnnn."" I vill hurt uu like yuu ave neever benst hurt befoooreee. I like to have people think that I'm their friend. It makes me laugh. I was reading my friend's journal. S'funny. She likes to make fun of this one person that I spent a full year in school picking on and beating on. He makes it too easy though. He needs to fight back, but he's kinda feminine which goes against the fighting back thing. You can't fight without changing personality to suit. So, if you're a pacifist feminine male, you can't fight without suddenly become a pugnacious masculine male. If you think about, everything you do is like levelling up in a role playing game. (cough LAME cough)

Look at it this way. When you level up you pick the characteristics you want to enhance like this:

Level 1: pacifist feminine male

Attack: 2
Defense: 7
Intelligence: 4
Speed: 7

But see, if you take your points and add them to something else via the level up, it would change your type.

Level 2: pugnacious masculine male (5 points upgrade)
Attack: 7
Defense: 7
Intelligence: 4
Speed: 7

See? By adding your ""points"" to ""Attack"" you become stronger and more masculine. Therefore, if you are a 

Level 1: Butch Dyke, like this person's femal friend,
Attack: 7
Defense: 7
Intelligence: 3
Speed: 3

By adding your points to something else, you get

Level 2: Shapely Female
Attack: 7
Defense: 7
Intelligence 6
Speed: 5

But unfortunately, neither one of these people are changing their personality types any time soon. I wish they would, it's driving me insane. I hate fags and I hate dykes so therefore, I find both of them rather dislikeable.

But if you're ME

Level 98: Killer Southern Son of a Bitch
Attack: 50
Defense: 100
Intelligence 175
Speed: 100

and you level up like normal, you would get

Level 99: Kick Ass Killer Southern Son of a Bitch
Attack: 55
Defense: 100
Intelligence: 175
Speed: 100

And there you go. Me, in all of my 5'0"" glory. Yes, I am single but I'm ugly so don't even bother."

Why I say I have no friends, after posting about them in the past? Well. For some ""strange and inexplicable"" reason, it seems my name dosn't appear on their buddy lists. It's called blocking, you fucking retards, I'm not stupid, so you must be assuming that I don't know what being BLOCKED is like. Funny thing is tho, is that I liked the people that are blocking me, and for once, I dinna piss them off on my will. Which, BTW, my nwe frnad si a prseon nmaed minDKontrol. Odd person.. but at least on the same page I am.

Ahnd. His quote thingy on MBs is pretty cool ""i come from within the darkness to reap the benefeits of your mind""

I also had a very funny conversation about animals, where I told the person that I thought Lizards are cooler than Hawks. When he said that Hawks soar, I simply replied, ""But lizards don't get sucked into jet engines""

Gmaes are cool. I cna fxi ur gmaes. Currently though, I am working on a very in depth Vampire game, that will eventually be translated into C++, when I learn it, and then maybe a neato GBA (game boy advance) title.

On the front of Vjo games anyway, the GBA will launch soon. Is it worth it? With isometric polygonal games like Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 Advance, games like Doom, and a cooli little warrior princess game, plus about 50 other LAUNCH titles, I would say ""Damn straight you mutha fucka""

"event","People bother meeee tooo much. They won't leave me alone. G'ah I'm gunna hurt the next annoying BITCH or BASTARD to bother me. Grrr. 

Whee.

I thought up a little more on the plot of Merklin. You play Merklin, a wizard who's always wanted to be like Merlin, the great one. But you never could because you kept fucking up every single one of your spells (you've even turned the princess into a boar, twice). And that pissed the king off. So he exiled you. And 4 years later you cracked. And then you got drunk. A crazy drunk wizard with the power to turn you into a boar is NOT a good thing. So now you must go forth in the kingdom of CheezewizZ and DESTROY that BASTARD Merlin. Fun, 'eh?

Well, along the way you learn more spells. These range from remembering how to turn people into boars all the way to causing torrential rains of cow cushions (cow patties, cow crap, cow shit, whatever you wanna call it). To use these spells, though, you must first charge your MAGICAL ABILITY up really far so you won't run out. Then, you must be DRUNK ENOUGH to understand HOW to do the spell. (it turns out merklin is a good wizard, when he's drunk) To get ""drunker"" you must collect the beer bottles on the levels. But you don't HAVE to. Nooo.. you could just run around and throw  the ""Magic Boomer's Wang of Juztize and Poly-Ticks"" And you also get this nifty pet Bobble Beeble later.. but we won't get into that JUST YET..."

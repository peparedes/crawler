"event","Sooo, I like to burn things.
<lj-cut>
In fact, I am an acknowledged and unapologetic pyromaniac.  Luckily, my father has always been a bit of an aspiring Mad Scientist/Inventor, and was quite pleased to indulge me, since it meant he got to continue his life-long study on the explosive qualities of a wide assortment of household products.
I have happy memories of standing over fires of varying sizes, and getting absentminded advice from Dad. Mainly along the lines of ""Suuure, throw that in, it'll burn."" and ""You might want stand back a bit with that one."" Oh, and the classic, ""Here, try this one, it burns green!""
He and my brother, on the other hand, tended to quickly lose interest in fires that did not also result in explosions. Not so, yours truly. No, it is a well known fact in my family that if my assistance is needed in house or yardwork, setting something on fire is the way to both acquire and *keep* my interest. Leaves, sticks, small outbuildings, whatever. As long as there are still visible flames, I'm there. *heh*

Thus, I am our family's official Burner of Things What Have Piled Up. 
Many a happy fall day I have spent, gleefully chucking mounds of leaves into a burn barrel. (Affectionately referred to by my Dad and I as ""the Belchmaster"", the burn barrel was an idea of his, in which a small hole is punched into the bottom of a large steel barrel, and a metal tube is fed into said hole. Add a medium-size shop-fan to the other end of the tube, and lo! Instant incinerator. It works brilliantly. You can burn whole *trees* in less than half an hour!Muwahaha. And it burns so hot, there's hardly any smoke!) 
When I'm not traumatizing the local fire-department, my jobs range from Chief Stick Picker-Upper (so that I will have more things to burn), to Part-time Hedge Tamer,(which, coincidentally, *also* results in more things to burn!) 
Best of all is the fact that unlike in my younger years, I am now considered reasonably trustworthy, (in that I have not blown-up anything important in *recent* memory), and thus I get to burn things without supervision. (As opposed to my older brother, who just last weekend felt it helpful to add kerosene to an open burn pile at my Dad's house. I was occupied in the back-yard with the Belchmaster, and thus escaped the Wrath of Mom. He gets into trouble even *with* supervision. *smirk*)
Naturally, there is often a rather large wait between fires, since things have to accumulate into a decent-sized pile before I am allowed to set them ablaze.
However, at this time of year, the piles grow at a pace sufficient to allow me to toast my way through a large bag of marshmallows every other weekend. (Heh. I love pruning season.)

Anyway, this week, the pile grew much, much larger and faster than normal, due to the contribution of several large azaleas that got a severe haircut. Thus, the amount of To-be-torched was roughly three times the size of the usual. Add in several other factors, like a stack of old crates and wooden pallets, and the 4 x 4 x 4' pile of pruned limbs off the huge forsythia bushes out front, and you have the makings of a first-class, grade-A, all-day bonfire!
...However! The Assistant Stick Picker-Uppers elected to combine all of the burnables into one large pile, instead of making several small piles from which I could have fed the fire. 

....

Now, given my admitted pyromania, when presented with the options of: a) Very Large Fire!!, and b) hauling branches and whatnot off the pile until it was closer to the usual size, which do you suppose I chose?
...Darned right! Yours truly went *straight* for the lighter. Mwa.Ha.Ha.Ha!
BUUUUUUURRRRN.

But! Upon reflection, (and post- several Rather Exciting Moments), I feel that today's Garden Lesson must be: Burn *smaller* piles. SMALL PILES ONLY, crazywoman! 

Because when it went up, it went *up*. Nearly twenty-five feet, in fact. The whooole pile. At once. (It was <i>Awesome.</i> *glee*)  
However, the extreme heat ended up singeing the nearest tree's lowest branches pretty badly, and resulted in several panicked minutes of hose-wielding from a rather distressed Hima. It also resulted in some  alarmed neighborhood children, who apparently could see the fire from over a high privacy fence, and despite being down a steep slope. Luckily, their parents are used to the sight of smoke coming from our yard, so I did not get a visit from the fire-department this time. *sheepish expression* 
The fire was even hot enough to melt some old aluminum window frames that ended up in the pile somehow.
...*shifty eyes* 
(Melted metal is fun!)

So yeah, I had a good time today. Hee. 
I do feel a little bad about the tree, but Mom's not fussed, so I'm not too concerned.  Apparently, those branches were scheduled for pruning anyhow. 
...More for next week's pile. *evil grin*
</lj-cut>

Anyway. If I remember, I'll post pics of the strange plant Mom got for the shade garden, (my unofficially claimed territory, since I am deeply allergic to strong sunlight. *grin*) It is stripey and weird and makes purple flowers. I like it!"

I think I may need an intervention, because over the last few weeks Final Fantasy 7 has <i>*devoured my soul*</i> I mean, I've read and enjoyed FF fics for years, but it was never an actual *fandom*, it was just me reading things by authors I liked. Well, that and also me having a weakness for Sephiroth. But hey, breathing, not blind, so nothing unusual there, right?

Anyhow.
My online life now belongs to the soul crushing <i>angst</i> and disproportionately large percentage of total hotness that is the cast of FF7. (ohhh, the infinite possible combinations...) I don't even hate the girls! Which is way more than I can say for most of the other fandoms I've been in. However, I will say that my heart belongs to fandom!Cloud. Because he is adorable and broody and he likes chocobos and he really, really needs a hug. Also, everyone wants a Cloud, but they almost never refuse to share. (*Sephiroth.*)  He's like chocolate, I swear! He goes with anything and you can't help but love him.
I know more about these people than I do the ninjas, Muri. And you know I'm a walking Bingo Book. Although I did read this one awesome crossover between the two...

For serious, it is not pretty. I'm actually thinking of ...*shudder*...<i>writing</i> something. Ohyes, things have indeed progressed to that point. Already there have been doodles. No, I will not show you, for they are very pitiful. I'm looking for good fanart to...study, if you know of any. *grin*

I have no idea what happened. I mean, there I was, happily lounging about in the Naruto and HP fandoms, when lo, a game I *have never even played* proceeded to stroll up, flirt shamelessly, and then consume my life. 
It came out of nowhere! Rather like a lightning strike. Or possibly a Meteor. *ahem* Anyway, I need recs, if anyone has 'em. Though most likely, I have read it at some point over the last three weeks. But if not, I will shower you with gratitude.

Well, to me anyway.

Take last night's showing, for example. Final Fantasy, the Musical! It was very peppy, for a series with so many angsty characters. And a one point those two goofy pirates from Pirates of the Carribbean wandered by, still in drag. I recall wondering what they were doing there, but the rest of the production seemed to take it all in stride. 
However, I did not get to see the ending, as Muri and T-chan (who also attended), didn't come back after intermission, and the world's scariest doorman would not let us back in after I went to check on them. I was very sad. But then I remembered Sephiroth, and it wall good.

...Because possibly you have not lived until you have seen *Sephiroth*, in a zoot-suit, singing and dancing. 
He was actually very good. Not that he would be bad at anything, but I distinctly recall being very impressed with his singing voice. I cannot remember what it sounded like, though. *pouts*
But still! Zoot-suit! 
Ahahaha....

Hmmm. However, it just occurred to me that there were no chocobos. Maybe they're too hard to train for the stage?

"event","So, having nothing better to do, I thought I'd post some of the better fics I've gotten attached to lately. Having finally given up on my old rule about never reading unfinished stories, I promptly stumbled onto a dozen or so fantastic writers...none of whom have *ever* finished a story.
*headdesk* 

But! These are all good stories that have been updated fairly recently, and have living authors. I know this, because they write *other* stories, while they leave me hanging on the one I like. 
*sporks them*
Anyway, here's a random collection of things to read, if you don't mind having to wait for the ending. Annnd, anything I rec carries an implicit rec for the rest of the author's work, unless I say otherwise.

Fair warning, I prefer AUs and crossovers.

In the top slot, the fic that ate my brain:
<a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2731239/3/"">Team 8</a> by S'TarKan
Naruto AU, Gen, well written and highly addictive. Updates monthly, more or less. Reeeead it. 

In the crack-addled but ""OMGthisficisLOVE, I tell you!"" category:
<a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1866354/1/"">Jedi Harris</a> by The Dark Scribbler
Multi-series crossover, mainly Buffy. The title says it all, really.
This story is awesome. But very, very long. Gen
Technically it's complete, but it has an unfinished sequel, so.

In the ""Xander! I missed you!"" category: 
<a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2777348/1/"">Carving Out a Future</a> by Dreamfall
Buffy/Firefly crossover, gen so far. 
Lovely, loveable story. Updates fairly quickly, but never quick *enough*!

and there was more, but I accidentally deleted the rest of the post. So I'll have to add those later, 'cause I don't feel like typing all that out again. Argh."

"event","OMG <I>BABY SQUIRREL!!!</I>

Soooo.  There we were, on this fine, chilly afternoon, standing around outside for assorted reasons, when lo! We looked down, and and found ourselves in the presence of an outrageously cute baby squirrel. He (or she, we haven't been so rude as to inquire yet), was not in the least bit scared, and in fact seemed quite confident that we looked like the kind of people who could sort things out for him. Seeing as he'd gotten a bit confused, you see. And really, a nice warm cup of tea would be lovely, thanks.   
Of course, being the type of people who can't resist anything cute and fuzzy (you know, *thooooose* people. the ones with the cats. and a small mountain of old critter habitats in the garage), we naturally had a collective fit over him, and carried him inside to be loved and cuddled and called George. 
And, after having looked up baby squirrels and their needs (google, thou art my truest love), I managed to convince my family that *NO*, we did not want to become his mommies. No, what we are doing instead is : 1) giving him a nice warm place to sleep tonight, 2)  putting as much of the Pedialyte-substitute down him as he'll take, and 3)  trying to get him back to his real mommy in the morning.  The very nice lady I called for advice said that since he's not hurt or visibly ill, most likely he's just hungry and lost. If his mommy hears him calling, she will apparently come running, and by tomorrow afternoon, he will be back in his tree with her. But, in the worst case scenario, there are some folks in the area who will be better able to care for him until he's ready to head out on his own. In the meantime, OMG *CUTE AND FUZZY!!!!EEEEE!!!*
Ahem.
*sparkles*
Fluffy tail! Hee."

If you don't know about Open Canvas, it's a freeware paintprogram, available in many places, but you can go <a href=""http://home.cwru.edu/~nxl25/downloads/opencanvas.exe"">here</a> and get version 1.1 from a person who isn't me, but is wonderful nonetheless.

Once you have it, go 
<a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/anime/Jessjessica/oc/oc.html"">here</a> and read a nice little online guide about it. Pay particular attention to the NETWORKING.

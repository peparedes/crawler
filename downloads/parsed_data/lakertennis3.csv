My mom was a little bit mad at me today because i went to the play instead of out to dinner with them, so tommarow im spending the entire day with them at OMSI, it actually sounds kinda fun though... eh not really!  I saw the play again tonight! it was fun! everybody (once again!) did soooo good!  Katie, Beth, and Kelsey are supposed to call me soon!  I remembered what i had to tell katie and now im really excited to tell her! but shes not calling me yet so im getting frusterated... i think i might just call her...

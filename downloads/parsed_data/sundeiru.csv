"event","So I had my appointment with the oncologist yesterday to discuss the chemotherapy schedule and what will happen next.  He begins the meeting with ""We have a whole new plan and it's for a good thing"".  I was a little perplexed.

Apparently, my pathology was really weird so it was sent to the Mayo clinic for a second opinion.  This second opinion revealed a totally differnt tumor.  It's called pulmonary mucoepidermal carcinoma.  That's not the important part.  The best part is it's not a lung cancer that is treated with chemotherapy.  It's simply taken out and that's it.  There is a 90% cure rate the first time around!

It is a cancer and it had the possiblity to come back.  But it is low grade which means it is slow growing and not considered aggressive.  I will have to have serial scans to watch for a few years.  But I can keep my hair, not worry about infections, and enjoy my life without the fear of vomiting and being tired!!

I will be celebrating!!!"

I'm not looking forward to that, but the high likelihood that this type of cancer will return makes them think they want to just be sure.  

Don't have any other details.  I'm supposed to recover from the surgery first, and see the oncologist next week.  We'll see what's next."

"event","Shadow's doing better.  We picked her up from the vet's office Monday night.  Since they are not an actual hospital, they can't keep her overnight.  So they sent her home with her IV and we were to bring her back in the morning.  She still didn't eat overnight.  We returned this morning and she had lost another half pound (making a total of 6 pounds).  When you only weigh 39 pounds to begin with, she's looking pretty gaunt.  They kept her again for some more blood test and tried a moist food to stimulate the appetite.  It seemed to have worked and she has eaten a total of 1 1/2 cans today.  The fever was gone and they took out the IV and she's at home with us now.  Still no reason for the illness.  Lab work was all fine and the only thing with the xray was a lot of bowel gas.

She's in better spirits and has wanted to play some today.  However, now we seem to have a leaking bladder.  When she get's full, you can watch it drip out.  Gross, I know, but I'm not sure what it means.  We've been taking her to pee a lot and we are supposed to go back in the morning.  I'm hoping it's just a UTI and the antibiotics will take care of it.

She's still not 100% but I'm glad she's at least eating something.  Now we will have to figure out how to get her back on dry food :)"

"event","I think when you get a pet, you don't realize how much they will mean to you.  Shadow is like our child.  She gets treated just the same (except the whole crate thing).  So when something happens, it's scary.

We picked her up from the Kennel on Friday and she was a little sleepy.  But she plays hard there and we didn't think anything about it.  Well, she slept all weekend and hasn't eaten for three days and barely drank any water.  She's very lethargic and has not been interested in much of anything.  We took her to the vet this morning and she has a fever of 104.5 (which I think 101 is normal for a dog).  They have kept her for IV fluids, blood work, and xrays.

She hasn't really been sick before and it's a little scary to leave her at the vet.  I guess we'll know more once test results come back."

Right now, I am 25% body fat, meaning I have a lean body mass (bones, muscles, water, etc) of 95.25 pounds.  To be 18% body fat (that of a female athlete and still within a healthy range), I should actually only lose to 118 and keep my current lean mass.  If I build anymore muscle, I would have to adjust that even more.  If I go to 115, I will be below what is healthy for my age and sex.

So, I am adjusting my goal to 118 and 18% body fat.  Only 8 pounds of fat to go :)"

In our house in FL, her favorite place was in the front room laying in the bay window.  The window ledge was just the right height that she could lay on the floor and look out and watch all the goings on in the neighborhood.  Moving onto the third floor took that away from here.  Until now...

I had the bright idea of purchasing a camping cot to place in front of the big windows in one of the bedrooms so she can look out over the parking lot and watch all the people come and go.  She has taken up residence in that room.  I will even get up at night and find her sleeping on the cot, even though the blinds are closed and she can't see anything.  So I snapped a picture one day :)...

Training for the walk is going well.  I have been following the training schedule and then some.  Total walked for training purposes in 40 miles in 3 weeks.  However, I have walked an additional 12 miles on top as part of my normal exercise routine.  3 weeks down...21 weeks to go in training :)

I still have meat 2-3 times a week and I eat eggs, milk, and cheese.  But I started looking at more organic foods (most everyday companies now have an organic line) and overall healthier food choices.  So I went to Publix this morning to buy stuff for the next week.  My menu is for 7 days, eating out only 3 out of the 21 meals.  The total bill for eating healthy <drum roll>  <b> $192.00</b>!!!!!  And that's not including the fruits and veggies from the Whole Foods market!!  I can eat at McDonald's for three meals a day for the entire week and it's only $105!  Why is it that we have to pay so much for health these days?!

On top of that, I just put $67 worth of gas in my car.  On a normal week, that would get me about a weeks worth of driving as long as I stayed fairly close to my apartment.

So add it all up and just in food and gas, that's about $900 a month give or take!!  I make decent money but have lots of credit card debt.  That's difficult for me to swallow...I can't imagine feeding a family of 4 on half my salary!  I can totally understand families choosing between food and and paying rent."

In the apartment, she has her own room.  I have a second bedroom that has a rather large set of windows.  She LOVES looking out because she can watch all the people and other dogs in the complex from her 3rd floor vantage point.  So I bought her a camping cot that puts her right at window ledge level and she can lay there and look out all day long.  I leave it cracked so she can get the smells and everything.  She loves it.

The problem is when I leave in the morning.  She always goes into the crate and sits waiting for her treat.  So she gets one (just for going through the motions) and then I just leave the door open.  Then as I'm going out the door, she lowers her head and stands there with those big puppy dog eyes begging me to stay.  I leave and go down the stairs.  But then I look up and she'd standing in the window watching me leave.  It's heart breaking!  There is no way I could have kids...it would just be too hard to leave them to go to work as they were crying for me to stay!"

I didn't realize that an additional 30 seconds of running would be so difficult!  But I finished it and now I'm really tired.  I guess that's to be expected.  I'm back to my original starting point before I moved, so now I can just concentrate on my remaining 10 pounds.

I've also decided to cut back on my meat intake (following the advice of many)...eating more shrimp and fish.  I visited my doctor today for a check up and she was impressed with everything I have done recently.  Of course this is the first time I am meeting her, but I went through everything.  She said I am doing everything right, she would just recommend a more vegetarian approach, simply because of the higher cholesterol.  So I will be picking 3 days each week for chicken, beef, or pork and limit my serving size to 3 oz.

On other notes, work is getting better.  I found out that I will only have 3 out of the next 12 months where   I will have to work 15 days.  The other 9 will only be 7 days out of the month.  So I'm hoping to be able to get  to Florida more often.

"event","Well, I just did my first set.  The podcast was awesome...it was like having a personal trainer there with me.  Thanks <lj user=""yzztik""> and <lj user=""demeth"">!  I actually laughed out loud when the guy said ""you should be feeling the affects but not out of breath or tired"".  And he made a comment that ""This may be getting tough but I know you can do it"" just as I'm approaching the bottom of a hill.  But, I feel great (which is so different from before)!!

I just had three hurdles that became an issue:

1. I live in TN where there are hills...it started going down but had to finish going up

2. A dog NOT on a chain that decided Shadow would become a contender (I had to kinda fudge the times and run a little extra to get away)

3. The amount of jiggle I had in my ass as I ran.  I thought it had shrunk but apparently all the fat was left behind.

Otherwise I completed the entire thing and I'm ready for my baked fish and veggies for dinner."

"event","Okay...thanks to <lj user=""demeth""> and <lj user=""yzztik""> I am starting the couch potato to 5k regimen.  I can't seem to get over this hump and I'm hoping that the exercise will boost the weight loss and that I may get some relief from this mini-depression.  Today is Day 0...I will start the routine tomorrow.

I really want to lose these last 12 pounds and get it over with so I can get on with maintaining.  

Wish me luck!!

P.S.  I even made a spiffy new icon :)"

I was awakened by my bed shaking.  I was freaking out thinking the ghost that lives in our house had followed me.  But apparently it was just mother nature giving us an early morning wake up call :)

"event","I ventured out today to see what I could do.  I was told there were some great hiking trails in 2 city parks that are next to each other.  So Shadow and I set out to do some hiking.  I had everything all planned...packed a backpack with snacks, water, etc so we could just spend the day.  I was all excited and couldn't wait to get there.  Unfortunately, there was a cop on the highway that noticed my eagerness as well.  I got a speeding ticket doing 77 in a 55.  I have to take some traffic school thing and pay the fine and it won't count against me.  But it kinda put a dark spot on the day.

But when we go to the trail, it all went away.  I bought a guide and decided that we would take the Mossy Ridge Trail.  Advertised as a moderate level, 4.5 mile trail through the park.  Little did I know there was so much climbing on a moderate trail!  But we made it in one piece.  Shadow is currently passed out on the floor and I will be joing her on the couch soon.  But I thought I would post some of the pics I took.  I was playing with different settings on the camera, so there are several different views of some things.  And of course, a few of Shadow's first adventure.  It was a beautiful 75 degrees today so everything was perfect...except for the speeding ticket :)

This pic was taken the next day, so now the scabs have all fallen off and it's nice and smooth.  But I really like and I think it's exactly me...

I PASSED!!!!!!!

So now I am official and I can really get started with the packing and getting excited about moving.

This marks an end to my formal education...now I can start reading for pleasure, learning the digital scrapbooking in photoshop, and picking up the outdoor activities I have so missed.  Life can return to normal.

Now back to your regularly scheduled program already in progress."

"event","We spent last weekend in Nashville trying to get things all tied up for the move.  We looked at about 6 apartments, but settled on one that we really like.  It's a 2 bedroom, 1011 sq ft (which is more than what we thought we would be able to afford).  Hardwood in the kitchen, all black appliances, microwave and washer and dryer included.  It's in a newer development that has an open air mall with all kinds of restaurants, grocery store, etc.  There is a Chick-fil-a and a JoAnn's.  I'm set :)

I've been finalizing all the moving plans and trying to get everything organized.  We have an apartment, I've hired the movers, and we have all the plans in place.  Now I just have to pass my exam and we are all set.

The final move date will be February 22nd and I start my new job on March 3rd.  The commuting back and forth will be a pain, but it's the only solution for now.  

As for other things, I'm only 5 pounds away from my inital weight loss goal.  10 pounds from what I really want to be.  I'll get there.

I think that's all for now..."

"event","MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!

Wishing you and all of yours the best of days.

I've been okay for the most part so far.  That is I was doing okay until I got a letter from my aunt.  My grandparents always loved Christmas.  The house was always decorated and the tree FULL of presents for everyone.  We always had one special present from Grandma and Grandpa and our stockings were always full.  As the years went by, my Grandpa died and my Grandma couldn't go shopping or make those special gifts anymore.  She had a Christmas fund that she used every year and started just sending money to my parents to buy me something nice.

I received a letter from my aunt this year with a check enclosed.  It was my portion of the payout from my Grandma's Christmas fund.  She said she didn't know what to really buy and thought I could just take the money and buy myself something special.

My job now is to think of that something very special to buy for myself that will always remind me of the holidays at my Grandparents house.  That was the one thing I was sad about when I left IN for the last time.  I knew there would be no more Christmas's and Grandma and Grandpa's.  This holiday will never be the same for me."

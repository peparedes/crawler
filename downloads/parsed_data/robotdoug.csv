"event","So I am reading On The Genealogy of Morals, written by Friedrich Nietzsche for my philosophy class, and aside from it being really damn confusing and annoying, this guy is the biggest egomaniac i have ever known he just rambles on for pages.  It seem like your reading this journal, but instead of little small ramblings that a person can handle its like 30 pages at a time of some retarded ramble.  Seriously, I would be surprised if there was a real point or topic in this entire book.  All the lecutres that my professor make on this book seem to be pulled out of his ass.  They are good lecutres, but i can't see how he can possibly get all that meaning from this senseless crap.  The only good thing that i can get from this guy is his essay at the end of the text called Ecce Homo.  

Ecce Homo is broken up into different chapters and the title of the first three go like this: 1. Why I Am So Wise, 2. Why I Am So Clever, 3. Why I Write Such Good Books.  The rest of this is pointless and meaningless but these first three chapters sound awesome.  If i ever wrote a book i would want it to be something like that, bragging about how great i am!  Either that or i would write an autobiography, you know, the kind of books that get written because no decent person would write about such tools... yeah that would be cool."

"event","So, last weekend, on halloween I, DAVID A. GOSS meet the one NICK HEXUM!  Yes yes it is true and please calm down, i know that this makes me great.  He is an amazing god and it was one of the best experiences of my life... he even took the time to debate politics with this huge jackass and burned him!!  This guy was a high school history teacher and Hexum made him look like a little baby shitting his diaper... yes thats right, on top me being really sexy and having an amazing voice and making OUTSTANDING music he can school a history teacher in politics!  Wow, he never ceases to amaze me.

"event","The old man joggers check list goes as follows:

1. Shoes....Check
2. Pants....Check
3. Shirt....N/A

Is it just me, or does anyone else notice all the old man joggers that run around sporting the ""I'm to sexy for my shirt"" look?!  Now seriously, do they really think they can pull this look off?  Heres a news flash for you, YOU'RE 60 YEARS OLD... it's time to man up and wear a shirt.  Have these sleezy men no decency?!  Is it really that hard to open the drawer, reach down inside, pull out the shirt and slide it over your crazy wrinkled body?  Would it hurt you to make that little extra effort... i mean honestly.  

The reason i bring this up is because during class the other day i was mindlessly staring out the window and saw to my surpirse an elderly man jogging around the lake... without a shirt on.  His wrinkled body flapping in the breeze, just carelessly jogging by students.  What the hell!  Do you really think you are that good looking at that age that you need to show yourself off to the world?!  Then there are those who take it to the next level.

Driving back from school that very same day on Centeral Ave. i noticed another old man jogger, again without shirt.  As he slowy creeped by me i noticed that he was holding in his hand a shirt!  What the hell is this wacko doing?!  I walked to my car in a jacket and yet this guy thinks it's hot enough to warrent taking off his shirt?!  Is that really going to help on a day that it is 55 degrees and overcast outside?!  I swear, if i hope these old men don't take it any farther and just decide that the whole hassle of putting on pants is to much for them now, espically when they have such great legs to show off.  If i see some 60 year old nut case jogging down the street in his boxers i am just gunna lose it!

Oh and heres a GRAND JOKE!!!  I made it myself...

 So I walked into a car dealer the other day and talked to the salesman. After a short conversation he proclaimed, ""I have just what you're looking for!"".  A few minutes later he came back with Immanuel Kant, at which point I looked that salesman in the eye and said, ""I wanted an automatic!"" 

* If you don't think that is funny then you are obviously too far below me to ever comprend the words that come out of my mouth, but you are forgiven... now fetch me  some food you wench!"

"event","So there is a new show of MTV called Luguna Beach.  This is the most ridiculous show i think i have seen in a while, FOX seems to be in a dry spell so i guess someone had to pick up the slack.  So the premise of this new show, show a bunch of rich snob ass teens in their natural environment.  They drive around in stupid SUV's through the gold cost where they hang out at their absurd homes.  Inbetween showing how rich these brats are they have a love story in it.  They are trying to make it seem like rich people have their everyday problems too, even though their ""everyday"" problems include things like i love him and he loves her, i'm so depressed.  While the rest of america is struggling to pay bills and keep their jobs and work their way though school, these little snobs are bitching about how hard life is, waking up at noon, shopping for clothes, then shopping for expensice cars, getting their hair and nails done, then going to to beach for the night.  Oh man i would HATE that life, that must suck so much.  Not having to work, living in complete luxury and pretty much not having to lift a finger to do anything productive.  Shit i really feel for them, i am so glad that they are doing a show on this becase i thought i was the only one with these common problems.  

    I have an idea for a show for these bitches... its called come over here so i can punt you in the crouch.  Honestly that would make for some good TV, all that would happen for 30 minutes a week is a new rich jackass from that show would come to my house and i would greet them and then for the 29 minutes after punt them in the crouch, non stop punting.  To add some mystery to the show i would change the shoe every now and then, maybe a steel tip boot for those who are really spoiled.  

    So anyway, i hope that was worth the wait and if it wasn't, then come over here and say that... i need to film the pilot for this show and i'll be taking applicants all week!"

"event","Note: Do not read this if you are at all against poop.

Note: Take previous note seriously, there will be poo talk in this entry.

Note: Do not read this if you do not like Matthew Lillard... if thats how you spell it...

Note: Seriously this is that last note about poop... DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T LIKE POOP TALK!

Note: haha you thought that was the last note... sucker!

So about my poop... i just had the PERFECT POOP!  You know, one of those poops where after you take it you feel like a great load has been taken out of you and then you go to wipe but theres nothing there... some may call this phenomena the ""self cleaning poop"".  Anyway i just thought that it would be nice if everyone knew i just had one... and it made me think of Quintron... more of Qunitron to come later.  But back to the poop, seriously you could get dumped by a girl/guy, fail out of school, get kicked in the junk and have bascially the worst day ever but this type of dump will make EVERYTHING better.

Now on to Matthew Lillard... he looks like Kyle Farnsworth and if you don't think so then you're just to pig headed to see the truth"

"event","It has been a sad day indeed my friends... by the way the number has now grown to three, yes count them three!  I go to work today like any other day and after some mindless reshelving i prepare to have my sit when i notice a child on an internet computer.  As usual he is playing some random flash game, one that looks quite simular to a popular scrolling game called Super Mario Brothers for the NES.  The child next to him sees him playing this and asks what it is that he is playing, the first child then responds, ""i don't know what its called but this guy just made it, its awesome.""  Now i would normally have assumed that pretty much everyone, weather they are a gamer or not would at least know what Super Mario Brothers is... i mean honestly it is pretty famous.  What kind of world do we live in today where our youth grows up not knowing and respecting the video games that shaped the world today!?  When i have kids... well god willing if i have kids there will be non of this Playstation 10 crap for them.  They will have a proper gameing upbringing starting with NES, i would not put them through the painful crap of what was before the NES.  They will then every few years move onto the next system until they show that they are educated enough to handle whatever the hell the newest system is.  And if by some chance i find out that they played something new at a friend's house they will be beaten accordingly... one lashing for every minute played!  Now some of you may think this to be crul, well thats the opinion of a panzie... sorry"

"event","OK, so it's only been a day, but something has really been bothering me.  People that puts stupid as hell quotes in there profile or away message and even worse... when these shitty quotes come from you!  People who quote themselves think they are so damn cleaver and that what they say is so great that everyone should hear it... well i got news for you, NO ONE CARES!  When you have a quote like this 
""You must never stop, you must never give up, but most importlently** you must never lose heart."" -PW in your profile your pretty much just asking for someone to kick your ass.  I mean honestly, it's a new low when no one else will quote the crap that comes out of your mouth so you need to do it yourself.  Heres a thought, perhaps no one listens when you talk, maybe when you walk into a room every just shuts the hell up and leaves... take the hint!!!  If your going to put a quote in your profile for all to see, please at least make it something worth my 2 seconds and please please please stop quoting yourself... it really makes you seem desperate for attention, and Satan was desperate for attention... and look where that got him!

"event","So i was online the other day... tuesday the 21st of September and i took note of a friend's away message.  It was a link to a site that had a review about the new Star Wars DVDs that came out that very day.  What really bugged me though was not that there was a review about a movie that came out decades ago, but that there was a part on this site that talked about the differences between these new DVDs and the special edition VHS tapes that came out back in 1997.  Now how sad is it that the DAY of the release some nerd has already gotten screen shots of the new releases and screen shots of the older tapes and compared the two.  Maybe it's just me but that seems like another case of some nerd with too much time on his hands... and i know someone is probably going to say that it's much more nerdish for me to complain about someone doing this, so to them i say screw off.  I think that this world has come to a new low... and if you don't agree then just take a nap and realzie that you are in fact wrong."

"event","That title has nothing to do with what i have to write, i just thought that it might make more people read this... oh well.  Yah so i am watching Monday Night Football and i have realized how pointless most of the comments they make are.  Instead of going more into this i'll just leave it at that, if you really want proof just watch it some time.  Anyway i really have nothing more to say i just felt like i was letting down my one fan... WOJ... because i hadn't posted in a few days.  So the rest of this is pretty much going to drag on, and hey... heres a thought, why is it that when someone walks into a store like best buy they feel that they have to buy something.  Its those damn greeter people, if you walk through the checkout line with nothing they look at you and A. make you feel like a cheap bastard and then B. look at you like you stole something.  Man i hate those greeter people, i mean have the time they don't even say something to you... it's their job to say ""Hi"". How hard can that really be, say hi to everyone.  And then when they do say hi to you, you really don't know what to say back... its almost as if these people are paied to make uncomfortable moments.  I mean you've already walked by them and tried not to make eyecontact, so then you have to turn your head back and say hi, but by that time they are already saying hi to someone else and they don't even notice you anymore, then you need to turn your head back around and by that time your running into their table of ""Discount"" DVDs... the ones that no one buys but they have a hundred of them in the back so they need to sell them.  Man i hate those greaters... they are the preverbal thron that gives me gonorrhea!"

"event","Yah so, this will be the first rant i have.  The Glenview Public Library is run by a bunch of communists.  Now this may seem harsh, but it really makes sense when you think about it.  Communists wrote books, and the library is a place that holds lots of books... so naturally communists run librarys, that and the fat bitch from accounting looks like jabu the hut... you know that fat thing from star wars.  Man i swear to god if she ever got up i think that her legs would just snap from under her... GAHHH!  how lazy can you be when you need an electronic stapler, i mean seriously the effort of pushing won't burn that many calories, you'll get them back by eating another big mac... and another thing!  On wheel of fortune at the end the biggest winner spins that mini wheel and then plays the last puzzle to see if he can get something more, but it's always 25000 dollars!!! what the hell, honestly can someone please pick and lose something else... it's getting annyoing."

Oh i love so and so SOO much, then they talk about their day and some other pointless crap.  Then i saw a friend of mine who actually wrote something worth reading and it changed my mind, i didn't know you could be so harsh on these things... so i shall update this with rantings that i have through out the day, most of them won't make much sense but if you read this, then i pity you.

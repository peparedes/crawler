"event","so yeah, it's been a while since I wrote anything. key word, Wrote. that doesn't include all those damn quizzes. So how's everyone been? This has been somewhat of a strange past few days for me, but I really think (and hope) that things have turned out for the better. haha! the one person who knows what I'm talking about doesn't even have a computer. yeah...I'm pretty fucking tired so there's a good chance this'll just be a rant. 

So today I saw two of the most upsetting things I think I've ever seen in my entire life. Both were shows on that channel, Bravo. The first one, I don't remember the name, was a team of gay guys who makes over straight guys. I know you probably don't care too much about that, but that really pissed me off. I watched some of the show, and it was absolutely fucking ridiculous. It was, of course, 5 of the most stereotypical gay guys you could possibly find, each of which had a ""specialty"" (clothes, interior decorating, culture, you name it.) in which to ""make-over"" a random straight guy. I don't know, I guess I'm probably the only one pissed about this, but it just looked like a fucking show whose only purpose was to present the ""modern gay guy"" to the public for their fucking amusement, and I just hate that people see that and that become the idea of ""gay"". I don't know, this probably shouldn't bother me as much as it does, and I'm probably overreacting, but still, it was sickening. It's not like they couldn't have done the exact same thing with 5 chicks. They just had to add the whole thing about them being gay guys for everyone's amusement. But whatever...

Then there was the second commercial. I seriously started crying when I saw this. I saw a commercial for this show, ""Boy meets Boy"". and I'm thinking to myself ""alright, a gay reality show, I wondered when one of these would appear before the public""....Then I saw the catch. Okay, so these guys, or this guy, or whatever, have to try and choose a boyfriend, you know the whole date a guy for the show, then choose whoever at the end. The catch is, however, some of the guys are straight.       Let me give that a second to sink in, which I'm sure it won't. So let me paint you all a picture. Let's say that you're in this show, and you really fall for someone. so you spend your time dating them, and you really want to be with them. Then when you finally choose them at the end, they tell you they're straight. THIS IS A FUCKED UP IDEA!!!! It's fucking playing on these poor guys' feelings for your amusement. I guess you all probably think I'm getting carried away with this and everything, but I know what it's like, and it's a terrible situation. And it's not just whether or not they even like you, it's whether or not they even COULD like you. These people pretend to like you, and play on your emotions, so that at the end you can pick them and have them fucking tear your heart out. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH HUMANS!?! At least make it possible for the poor guy. This is just cruel. 

But whatever, fuck it. That's how we are, and I suppose I'd better grow to accept it, because the world is not going to change for me, as much as I wish it would. I'm probably gonna look back at this post and call myself an idiot, but whatever. There's a lot more I could say and I lot more I can't say, most of which is the same thing...and I don't think i'm really making sense anymore. I'm pretty tired, so I think I'm gonna head on to bed. Later."

"event","I went to astroworld today. It was fun...for the most part. I went on a bunch of rides I never thought I'd end up going on (dungeon drop and serial thriller specifically). I was having a good time and all...but Bonnie mentioned Robert (""Awww, it would be so cute if Max and Robert were sitting in that car together!"", don't be mad at me for saying that, I know you didn't mean to upset me) and I just couldn't stop thinking about how much I missed him and how I wished he could be there with us, with me. I guess they didn't really notice that I felt down, at least they didn't mention it. I wanted to get home and talk to him, cuz I knew we had all be gone and he wouldn't have had anyone to talk to. I stopped at John's house first though, only to find out that Robert's dad got his report card, and said that he has to stay at his mom's house in Corpus. Not only that, but that he may be getting his cell phone taken away, which means not only can I not see him, but I can't talk to him on the phone OR AIM. I can't believe this. It would be impossible to put into writing the immense love that I feel for him. And now, just like that...he's gone. I need him. He's the only person I've ever been able to express my true feelings to. The only person I've ever loved, truly loved like this. And now it's all just taken away, all just disappeared so easily. He's only been gone for 6 days and already it feels like it's been ages since I last saw him. The only thought that's been keeping me going is that of his return after a few weeks, just being able to see his face and hear his voice. But now that's all vanished...my best friend, my love, my life."

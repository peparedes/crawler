By the plan right now we will be staying for at least a year, but I think this is a good example that plans do change.

In other news I have a level 61 horde paladin that I'm strongly considering shipping off to the Lothar server to play with people.  Not 100% sure on this or what spec I'd have him in if I were to do that.  Any thoughts?


Edit:  The character name is Zypheranthes so add him to your friends list and send me a whisper or a in game mail with your characters names and I'll start building my friends lists!"

I've been here in Hamilton for about a week now. I'm starting to get used to everything, I might even start a job search next week!

I've been on a nice little vacation, doing nothing more then video games, cooking, eating and napping.  Ahh the fun!

I got my copy of C&C red alert 3 installed yesterday!  It's quite fun, but other people need to get copies so we can play together!"

"event","Work has been stressful lately.  It has been a combination of people not doing the right amount of prep for me and the lay out of the kitchen being so damned stupid.  

I'll explain the layout problem; On the menu I am responsible for the appetizers.  This in itself is not a problem.  The problem lays in the fact that I have to frequently run from one side of the kitchen to the other to cook everything I need.  This is such a huge waste of time!  if you ask me I should just be responsible for the cold food and the non-pasta side dishes.  As it is, I need to do the cold apps, the hot apps, and all the non-pasta side dishes.  It gets so frustrating to juggle so much stuff!  

Also the menu... its too big!  Think of it this way... I think the menu has 15 apps on it.  so thats 15 different combinations of food items I need to be able to do at one time.  Lets say it only had 8 items... The 8 most popular items, that means I would have more repetition, so a much easier time, less running around, faster time putting out food, happier customers, and hell, it could even save the restaurant some money.  If we cut out things that don't sell well and just stop buying them, then the food cost will go down, but because we've kept all the most popular menu items the amount of money coming into the restaurant would remain very similar.  What does this equal children?  Why more profit!  Yay!!  Only not.  Italo, my boss, is the type to love large menus and to fall in love with menu items, even if they don't sell well.  If one or two sell in a week he feels justified, even if we sold 30 of a more popular item.  Frankly I thnk the only reason he manages to stay open is top notch staff.

In other news, for reasons I choose to not to mention, I've been staying up VERY late these days and have been not getting much sleep.  I'm not complaining, I really enjoyed myself staying up that late, and I miss not having the reason around right now very much... but it was really intersting to know that I could go and help dad cut down trees, hack off all the branches and lug wood around (this took about 3 hours) then go home, sleep for half an hour, then go into work for a 6 hour shift that was one of the busiest nights of the week... all on that 30 min nap and one hot dog/piece of bacon/piece of bread.

Well I think that's enough for now... I think I'm going to try to update this more... see ya!"

"event","First I'd like to say I rocked a test and project today.  I got 23/20 (115%) on a wine test and 9/10(90%) on a presentation I did on farming rabbits for meat.  All and all I'm feeling really proud of myself!

Now, there was talk about warhammer this weekend and talk about deciding on what we should do ahead of time.  
I was thinking 2 things.  first Graham mentioned wanting to play a few small 250 pt games so he could play his marines a bit.  I think this is a good idea, playing a few small 'free for all's with the force organization chart being 0-1 HQ, 1-2 Troops, 250 pts.

I was also thinking I'd like to play some larger 1 on 1s at say, 1500 pts.  We could have 2 games going either by setting up the little board and the larger board or just splitting the larger board into 2 games.  This is, of course assuming we want to do it here.

For food I think Etch suggested we do delivery/take out so we can eat our meals around the game rather then play the game around our meals.  I really like and endorse this plan.  

Questions?  Ideas?  Comments?  Leave 'em!"

its 7 digits for 7 days, each number is my start time, 0s being days off, so I have monday and thursday off.  
This is the last week of no weekends off for me, and the following weekend is lan time!  I'll have to spend my days off getting this sty in order... I doubt anyone has the free time to help? 
Oh, while on this topic, does anyone have a table they can bring along?  just something small for a monitor and such... I have 8 people on the guest list, and I worked it out as only having tables for 7!  I'm sure I can figure something out... if push comes to shove I'll go out and buy something, its no big deal.
While still on this topic... any game requests... so far we've had Medal of Honour and I personally want to see how many people I can take on in C&C (preferably 3, I'm going to get an extra copy and cd keys for people, but its even easier to do with generals, so t hat would be fine by me) but other then that there hasn't been anything mentioned!  oh course I'd like to add mechwarrior now that I think about it."

For those of you who haven't been in enough professional kitchens to know what I meant, this means that from 5 till 9pm we were constantly busy, as soon as a table emptied they filled it, never giving us the chance to breathe... but we handled it like pros.  Not a single major screw up, no table waiting for food longer then anyone else, no one getting cold or over cooked food.  To quote one of my co-workers we were on FIRE! I never stopped moving and man it felt great.  It was a perfect night, reminded me exactly why I want to cook.  I'm still feeling really good about it.

On a similar note... Man I'm tired."

Also:  It's been suggested to me that we go to Boston Pizza this coming sunday (the 10th) for supper to celebrate my birthday (which is friday the 8th).  I approve this plan and would enjoy as many people as possible to join me.  Hopefully enough people to split my bill so I dont have to pay and no one will feel the pain of paying for me by them selves."

"event","So here's what I was thinking.  I may need some money this coming year for Christmas gifts, so I was wondering... If I cooked a big three course meal sometime early December, bought the food myself and charged people for the meal (with a small increase in price so I can make a profit) who would be interested in partaking?  I haven't worked much out yet and I'm still working on the menu.  I was just wondering who all would be interested before I go much further."

"event","So I have an offer for everyone who might be interested!  I am the Membership Committee head of the PEI Junior Chef's Association and well, we are always looking for new members!  It's come to my attention today that one does not need to be a student of a culinary school to be a member of Jr. Chefs!  So any of you out there interested in cooking or food should contact me and I'll get you registered!  There is a cost however, its $31.50 but considering all the free stuff we get to eat at our tastings and all the fun stuff we're going to do, its well worth that meager amount.  So everyone should sign up with me, its a great place to meet people and try new things!<br />Website!: <a href=""http://www.peichefs.ca/jrchefs.html"">PEI Jr Chefs</a><br /><a href=""http://www.canadianjuniorchefs.ca/"">Canadian Jr Chefs</a>"

"event","So if we are going ot be serious about running warhammer over here atleast semi-regularly, we should get some terrain made.  I've been trying to brainstorm up a list.  Heres what I have thus far:

-Trees: forests (1'x1') and smaller rows of trees (1""x6"")
-Bunkers: Infantry and tank. Imperial or otherwise... maybe orky or just blast craters
-Buildings:&nbsp; Ruins maybe whole buildings
-Hills: Rolling and impassable
-Tank traps and razor wire

Anyone have any other ideas?&nbsp; maybe any good ways of suplying this stuff or making it?"

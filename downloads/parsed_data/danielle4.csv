BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT! you all should be very proud.. i usually end up leaving my house at a good 5 till the bell! well except for the other day i think Friday, i locked my keys in my house and good ol' casey would not get up to save his freakin life! i mean really.. i BEAT ON HIS WINDOW WITH A STICK FOR 5 MINUTES AND RANG THE DOORBELL LITERALLY 79 TIMES. AND OF COURSE THE PUPPY DOG IS GOING PSYCHO B/C HE DOESNT HAVE A CLUE WHAT THE CRAP IS GOING ON.well i had to go next door to use the telephone( because it just so happens that i left my cell phone in the house also, righ by the keys ) and had to call mother parental ROBBIE to come home from work and let me in the house.. that day i left at umm 8:20??? but that day actually turned out to be GREAT because that night the PLEASANT GROVE !!!SPARTANS!!!

((happy bday scott!! i love you!)) and everyone but about 4 or 5 people were good and drunk by the time we made it to the 2nd bowling alley after the movie theatre after the 1st bowling alley.. *(couldnt quite make up our minds tonight you see)* and it was so great because i wasnt drinking.. and they all sat together *(the drunkerds)* and i sat righ tin the middle so we all could chat! hahahaha i love drunk people.. they tell you anything and everything and they dont care and probably wont remember it. but then lets see.. i rode home with chase p ryan g steph h alex e chris s and of course me! it was sooo much fun. only TWO people were not drunk, or had not been drinking... 2! chase knows every song in the world and alex is just alex.. 'nuff said me and steph just chilled and chris well i dont think he was actually WITH us the entire ride home, although  he was talking..? but now i am home and going to bed IM GIVING MY NIECES A BIG SURPRISE TOMORROW!!

"event","alright this is what i want to add to my day. And if anyone reads this and has any advice PLEASE COMMENT!!

alright. i like this guy, Andy. and i thought he liked me. well i guess you can say that we liked each other.. we flirt around a lot and everyone tells me that they can tell that we like each other or whatever........well.. i guess it was a couple of weeks ago. we hooked up one night, and its kinda what EVERYONe who knew that me and him were liking each other, and of course Me, Have been waiting on for a while.. so that was one night. then the next night this girl that likes him too told him that he was cute and that she really wanted to kiss him. ( i cheer with her, we're pretty good friends) so they hooked up too. after he took her home that night he called me and told me that he wanted to come and see me. he told me that she tried to kiss him but he told her...""No I cant do that to Danielle"" (he told ME thats what he told her... but..) so i was talking to a friend of mine later after he left and he told me that he really wanted to hook up with me.. but i told him no. he asked why and i told him that i liked andy and then i told him what he told me that he said to morgan (the friend i cheer with) and that i couldnt do that to him if he couldnt do it to me. well that made me feel REAL DUMB because he was there whent andy and morgan hooked up. and he told me. (he didnt actually tell me but the way he avoided it made it obvious) so i called andy and asked him if he had lied to me. he told me no and then i told him what i had just been told. and he got real mad and said that it wasnt true and he was just trying o start rumors and all this crap. well i called morgan. she told me yes that they hooked up. then andy called me back and i told him what she said. then he was like fine i kissed her.. but that was it a quick peck on the lips. then he came over to my house so i could talk to him. he argued with me for about 15 minutes that that was all they did and I kept telling him that i didnt care that he kissed her (becuase we arent dating and he can kiss whoever he wants) but it  made me mad that he would lie to me about it. and then finally he just told me the whole truth that she told him he was cute and that she really wanted to kiss him. and so he did. well that made me mad too b/c he had been lying to me about what had actually happened. but i was glad he finally would tell me the truth. so i was like alright you know whatever its fine.. then we go bowling saturday night (that all happened thursday) and we were sitting there talking and he asked me what i wanted ""us"" to be. i was like i dunno what do you think? and he told me friends with benefits? i was like no. dont like that. then he said well do you wanna date? i was like yeh. but then he goes "" but i wanna date other people too"" i was like who morgan? and he says yes.. well that just makes me a ittle upset so i get tj's keys (we rode with him there (Andy's best friend)) and i went to sit in his car till we left. but andy followed me out there because i was crying (i was hurt.. girly emotions that i cant help geez) well at first i locked the doors and didnt let him in but finally i did. he told me how i was so perfect for him and how much he wanted to be with me and how he didnt want to be with morgan because blah blah blah. and he was being really sweet, you know saying everything that any girl would wanna hear.  i fell for every word he said and i was in his arms again.  when he holds me i really do feel like everything is ok. he makes me feel so good and soo bad at the same time. (i really like him a lot) but i dont know what to do because umm the next day he was like i think we should be friends for now. i need time. so now we are friends but we really havent talked in like well, that was a week and a half ago so.. its been a week and a half. we'ev talked twice for a little while but thats it.. so if anyone has anything they wanna say to help me figure out what i should do, PLEASE tell me. you can comment this or you can email me at pGSOFTBALL04@aol.com (thats my screen name too if you have aim or anything) good night!

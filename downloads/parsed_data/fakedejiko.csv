"event","This is my first experience with a substitute teacher.
In the 2nd grade, I had this terrible fear of substitute teachers. There had never been a sub in class before, but I was afraid that they were mean and didn't know how to treat 7-year-olds. I was afraid they would try to make us do hard work, and force us to do assignments that were way beyond our capabilities and understanding. We would then be stuck there at school, alone, without our dear teacher, with a horrible substitute teacher, forced to work on hard assignments all day.
Well...
One day, I came to school, and I realized my teacher wasn't there. Instead, a sub was at the front of the classroom. I immediately feared the worst. Soon, my fears became real... On the chalkboard was the agenda for the day:
- Welcome, Introductions
- Silent reading
- Science lab
- Lunch
- College
- Math
- Recess
- English activity
- Pack up to go home

""Wait a minute!! What is that I see listed right after lunch... COLLEGE?? COLLEGE!!! OH NO!!! I was afraid this would happen one day! I just knew it!""

Well, right after lunch, I was so scared. I felt sick. I couldn't believe this horrible substitute teacher was about to make us do COLLEGE WORK. I was about to cry. 
Then, the sub handed out sheets of paper, magazines, scissors, and glue... and said, ""alright, we're going to make something fun. Who knows what a collage is?""

""Oh, COLLAGE... hah!"""

"event","K yeah, so first off, huge appologies for abandonig myspace/livejournal/AIM/etc... 
So I am going to tell you what has been happening since the last 2 months, hah.
but the good news is, I will be coming home in two and a half weeks. The 26th, baby.
So, when we last left off, I was totally crushing on this kid Austin, right? Yeah, I really was. This was for the valentines formal. Dude, so yeah, I'm still alive ^_^ thank you all who responded to my last entry. I was gonna reply to you all but I have been, not around. And pretty confused and wondering what the heck happened. And then I was wondering how to respond!! But yeah,... since then, something completely turned around has happened. 

I have completely fallen for Nathan.

Here's what happened:
So the night after that dance, I was feelin pretty bad about the thing with Austin. So I took Nathan aside and we went to Hogi Yogi and hung out there a while, and I soon realized that I would have so much more fun with him than with Austin anyway, and I asked him out! After a series of questions (mainly about austin) he agreed. He had told me he had a crush on me after telling him that I liked Austin. I totally don't like Austin anymore though. I'm still sad though that the 3 of us don't hang out anymore, but its ok because I really like Nathan, a LOT. We had our first kiss on Valentines day. It was so much fun. 
I have never felt so dizzy after a kiss. I wanted it so bad
I think the reason I liked Austin so much was because I prevented myself from liking Nathan. I knew it was gonna happen anyway. I had that feeling from the very start of the friendship, but I just wanted what I couldn't have. Austin wasn't interested in me at all, and I knew it, looking back.
But I don't care anymore. 

I have never felt like this before. I am in L-O-V-E, you guys.
We've spent everyday together since then. He's boosted my self confidence way up. He's made me into a stronger person mentally and physically. He's turned me into a person I didn't think I'd ever be in a hundred years. I honestly don't know what I would be doing if I wasn't going out with him or better yet, if I hadn't met him. He's a good guy.
On tuesday we will have been going out for two months. Its only two months but I feel like I have known him longer. We've done so much.

I appologize for the mushy entry, but this is so real, and it is happening to me.

Everyday I am with him I just love him more and more, and it doesn't stop growing. Sometimes I feel like I am going to explode if I don't stop loving him this much, but it doesn't stop (and I don't explode).

Anyway, I am going to be home between April 26th to May 3rd, so make room in your schedules for me hanging out time! That is a wednesday to a wednesday! Its gonna be so much fun. We need to have an anime marathon in there"

"event","I slept with my old teddy bear last night, the one I slept with from ages 1 till I have no idea. I hadn't slept with him for years. He is very loved though. He used to be pink but now he's white.
I fell asleep quickly, amazing how that works. And I slept well.
I was thinking as I was falling asleep that he is why I sleep the way I do. He fit in my arms perfectly, like a puzzle piece, perfect angles and everything. I was comfortable. Because I slept with him like that all the time when I was little.
There is still even a secret object in him that as a kid I used to like to play with and helped me go to sleep. When I did that last night I instantly felt sleepy.
The psychology of it all is so cool. Proving to me that the way we react to things is pretty much fixed from the way we did things the first few years of life.

When I was like 3, I guess, I named him Teandae Dippidy
When I was 4, and in kintergarten, I gave him a middle name, after my kintergarten bus driver, mrs lippity. I still remember her smell. I don't really remember what mrs lippity looked like, but I remember her smell, funny how smell really is the strongest sense for memory. (and then a little bit after mrs Killbee became the busdriver. I was sad and/or maybe a little scared of her just because I didn't trust another bus driver. I remember Mrs V, my kintergarten teacher said ""this is mrs killbee"" as she put her hand on my head when she said it)

Teandae Lippity Dippidy. (The e at the end is even silent, haha. Tee-and-ah)

Haha what a weird kid I was. I still am =-)"

"event","Clean room, clean clothes, clean sheets, clean body, clean mind, clean spirit, clean soul. ALL OCCURING THE SAME TIME. SHYUSS!!!! I am CLEAN! This is something I've wanted for YEARS! 
I feel great.
Let me go further into detail:
College in 3 weeks. Therefore, I must have my room clean and extremely clean, spotless, and organized. I have done that today!
I must have every single article of chothing I own washed, dried, folded, and put away. Usually when I do my laundry I never get around to a basket of dirty clothes laying around. Or there are one or two basketfulls of clean clothes that need to be put away. I spent all day yesterday doing laundry without rest... I have, count them, 7 baskets of clean clothes, and one dresserfull. I will fold them later on, but the fact remains that they are in order and all CLEAN! All of my clothes. (yes I have too many >.<) This hasn't happened in forever. And to keep myself from distracting myself with something more entertaining, I cleaned the laundry room for my mom! And now the laundry room looks fabulous.
Clean sheets- I love changing my sheets, because it feels so nice when I have clean sheets, including a clean quilt. 
And what goes well with slipping the self into clean sheets? A clean body! And so a shower! What goes nicely after a lovely shower? Clean towels... and then, I put on CLEAN pajamas! 
After sleeping, the mind is clean. The spirit and soul are clean, because its sunday and so I feel good today. 
Its the end of the semester, I don't really have assignments due which is extremely convenient because I'm too busy taking care of college preperation business here!
My face is also clean, because I haven't worn makeup in several days, it makes my eyes feel happy. My body is also feeling healthy.
Oh, and I've almost got all my christmas shopping done too!
In conclusion, I am existing in a near perfect state. The only thing is that I'm on my period... and that makes keeping clean a challenge, but I have my ways with dealing with that unless I get lazy which I cannot do!"

"event","Yesterday, I wrote this: 
So, Here I am. At ocean city... when it snowed 2 days ago. Oh my gosh. 
Today seems like so long. But it wasn't boring long, there was just a lot of stuff that happened today. Man.
Last night- Chip and I stayed up till after 4 playing secret of mana over the internet. That is the funnest thing in the world, let me tell you.
I called around to see who wanted to go shopping with me in the morning (black friday) and sydney and chip said they would. I decided to wake up at 630, so I would be getting a whole 2 hours of sleep. So my alarm goes off when its supposed to, I fall asleep before I am able to set my alarm for 10 minutes later (my phone doesn't have a snooze, I use my phone for an alarm since I have lost faith in my real alarm clock since the power is glitchy sometimes) So sydney calls me at 715, I was supposed to pick her up at 7, I got ready in 20 minutes so we were fine.
Shopping- it was more for the experience. I have never shopped on black friday before, it was interesting. But it was still just a crowd. I'm glad I got to spend time with sydney before she goes back to ohio.
I got back home and finished packing, we were supposed to leave at 11, but nobody was ready. So I had tume to get some games from chip.
We ate lunch  (guess what it was, leftovers!) and then headed off.
The drive wasn't very long, each time we go to OC it seems to take less time to get there. I was really tired though. I would have slept in the car except that I can't sleep in vehicles very well. Same goes for airplanes.
We are at the quallity inn. Its a pretty nice hotel. I'm actually in the lobby right now because they are on wireless.
We walked the boardwalk looking for food. It wasn't really that cold, my nose was numb but the rest of me was fine. We were looking for food to eat but nothing is open this time of year of course.
The stupid thing was, in the arcade, they had ITG and Pump. I wanted to play ITG but then I realized it was just a ddr machine with ITG programmed into it. And the worst part was that they were ddr pads... which doesn';t work. Pump, I played but for some reason I cannot figure out for the life of me how the thing works and accidently put myself on hard mode, so I failed. Oh well.
Well we found food eventually, we drove up the street to burger king.
We wanted to get into the hot tub/pool after we ate. So we got in the hot tub, and the hot tub wasn't hot. In fact it was probably only about 5 degrees warmer than the pool... so we got in there anyway. There were these two other chicks, I guess they were sisters, that got in there with us, they were like, ""this isn't very warm"" and they went to go tell the front desk about it. It took a long time for them to start the hot water again, and when they did it felt so good, cause I was still freezing. Then, we noticed the water level was going down, because they had to drain it out. But, they FORGOT about it and they drained it all the way. Pretty soon we were all sitting in an empty hot tub, me, tt, my mom, dad, aunt,uncle, and the two girls sitting at the bottom of an empty hot tub.They forgot to start the water again, and they forgot to enable the jets. It was so funny. We were all sitting in there for about 3 hours total (probably about 1 and a half hours in it empty). We got a picture. When it wasn't even half way full we decided to get out. That was probably the best part of the day.

Today: we went out on the boardwalk this morning and rode bikes. I like the banana bikes, you lounge on them and you're real low to the ground. Haha, I can't really ride a regular bike anymore, its been so long since I last rode one. I know it would only take a minute to get the hang of it again, but still, its kinda funny. I do need a bike though. I definitely need one when I go out west so that I can go places, I won't have a car.
We went to Phillips to eat dinner. Its really good. Its really fancy but its the scary antique type of fancy, the kind that scares me. I don't like antique-y things and interior from the 18/1700s. I don't know why. The place was cool because it was piratey. Or at least the outisde of it was."

Earlier sydney and I went on a black friday adventure, we didn't do much shopping, just mainly browsing. It was interesting but I would rather have slept, but at least I got to spend some time with Sydney.
Yeah I'm running on 2 hours of sleep right now cause chip and I were up till after 4 playing secret of mana over the internet through znes, and that has to be THE coolest thing I have ever done with a game.

I was driving back from school on 70 east and this car was going awfully fast and tried passing another car, but they got back into the lane they were in (left) and did a 360 and then skidded into the median, I thought they were going to head right into oncoming traffic on the other side but I guess they stopped just in time, they may have been in the shoulder of west but I am not sure, but I called 911 anyway and told them what had just happened, just to be on the safe side incase they had gotten hurt or they couldn't get out or what. It happened so fast and It scared the crap out of me. I thought they weren't going to stop in time and get hit by oncoming cars...
People, please don't drive fast when its raining...

In other news: There was a fire alarm in the L building at fcc. The fire alarm is exactly like Urbana's alarn except a man's voice, he's saying the same thing too from what I can remember.

I went to bed at like 10 last night, I was ready for sleep at 9... I got about 11 hours of sleep, I guess I really needed it. I was still tired today. I was tired probably because I am still sick, it was raining, I don't eat, its cold, and the most common- I got too much sleep!

And people, don't worry about me not eating, its just because I'm sick. I go through this a once or twice a year and it ends up ending simply because I find I like food too much and plus thanksgiving is coming up  =-D  =-)  %-)

Tomorrow is tuesday and that means I get to work with Maria, hopefully. Sometimes she's not there. 

I close my eyes and I can see the lil bad critters in secret of mana getting killed with little red HP numbers overhead. I've been playing this all day... 
I got the new xbox 360 controller and hooked it up to my computer so I can play my games. Its usb, since its made by microsoft. Which is the neatest thing in the world. And if I ever wanna play some of TTs games I'll have my own controller. He's currently up in frederick with ryan and the crew standing/camping in line for the xbox system, lol. Tomorrow we'll know if he was one of the 30 lucky recipients of the new xbox 360 system. Laura noticed that the new system has an hourglass shape to it, which is the closest to a woman some guys will ever get, haha.

"event","TT and Laura have been going out for almost 3 years officially, over 4 years since they became friends. Whenever I look at them I love what they have. The idea of having a stable relationship with somebody just feels so safe. The line that seperates where they are dating and friends isn't visible anymore, and I love that about them. They are as much in love as they are best friends with eachother. That's just the most beautiful thing to me.  
I have gone out with two guys since Brad and I didn't appreciate how nice it is to have a stable relationship with somebody until after we broke up. I do love dustin, its just so butterfly feeling-y but its still insecure and I guess I'm really not used to that. Loving somebody after many years is so much more deep and meaningful, and we all know that. I just want tt and laura to really grasp that, because I don't think they've dated anybody before eachother or even kissed anyone before they met. Sometimes during the course of those 3 years I kinda wanted to feel like I did when I first met brad. And now that I'm at that point again where things feel lovey dovey. But now I know that I prefer the deeper more meaningful long term type of love. Most people these days don't prefer/enjoy that kind of love, but I do. The one that will always be there. I miss KNOWING that there will always be a person you can come to and just be by your side where you don't have to worry about anything. Its just gonna take a while for that to happen again, of course. Whoever its with. (I'll make a good 3rd wife as dustin would say haha, jk-ing)

Laura was baptized on last saturday. TT baptised her. He's gonna do one semester of byu and then go on his mission. So that's 2 and a half years, and if they're meant to be then it'll work. I really hope so. I do love laura like a sister recently in the past year. Jennifer feels the same way. I never doubted Laura even through all the badness that went on during the summer. She's a good person, I really hope they get married. I can't immagine him with anybody else but her, it wouldn't look right. Or laura with another guy. I guess she already is pretty much part of our family since we've known her for so long. She eats dinner with us every sunday cause she comes to church with us, and everybody at our church knows her. It would be cool if her family could join the church too."

Its true though, when you aren't seeing that person you are going through withdrawl and you have those same symptoms as needing a drug. And when you're not with that person all you think about is them and the world is just kinda, there. Yeah we've all been there.

I got my BYU-I course catelogue in the mail! Its exciting.
I also found out today that I will not be graduating with my AA, its ok thouhg, it just makes me mad that I'm just one credit short because my aeroics teacher refuses to cut me some slack and is giving me an F. Well its really my fault but fine. I don't care. More money for me, as in I just told Liz that I can start working thursdays now in replacement of my aerobics class that would otherwise be in dead center of the work day. And besides Maria told me to since I'm her bitch haha.

I also have a cold. Its one of the better ones I've had, it's just a lot of sneezing, every 30 seconds, I'm not kidding. and its driving me insane.

I am getting over brad still actually believe it or not. 3 years was really long. Dustin's getting over his ex, and she was 14, I have no room though, me being 16 and brad 21, lol. In both of our situations we were all forced to break up. She moved to texas, and well, if you know my story, its probably far more tragic but I don't know the full part of his story.

Anyway, I think I'm something good for him. I know he needs somebody to be there for him and I can surely do that. I just feel bad that we've got a time limit. 
I'm not gonna be gone forever though. I'm not moving, I'm just going to college. 4 months isn't that long. If he wants to wait for me after that I'll have 8 months back home that I won't be in college, because I have the summer at home for online courses and the fall I have off (because I'm in the winter/summer track) We will have 8 months. But we'll see. 

I think we're fine the way we are though. He told me he's not really looking for a permanent relationship for once and neither am I so its good timing. Although, there is one problem- I've become hooked! I didn't wanna fall so hard but, ok. I dunno if he has become hooked on me or not.

I think I worry myself too much ovr the stupidest things. I'm always afraid that I will do/did something that turns the guy I like off. Like yesterday I did something and I didn't mean to and I didn't get a chance to explain myself, so I'm afraid I've made him think differently of me. But whatever. I doubt it. I bet he won't even know what I'm talking about if I mention it to him."

"event","what's really annoying is that after anybody takes a shower the smoke alarm goes off. We used to have a smoke alarm that was really sensetive back when I was a baby and then we got a new one, but that one broke and we got this one about a year ago.
And what happens is I get out of the shower, I'm supposed to leave the door open because it will cause milldew if I don't. So I do that, but all the hot steam goes up to the ceiling. The smoke alarm waits until I'm already sat down. (I like to sit down and let myself air dry for about 5 miutes after I get out of the shower) and once I'm settled, then it decides to go off. So I have to get up, put the towel back on, go out and wave another towel under the smoke alarm for about 5 minutes, using up 5 minutes of precious mornng prep time. Its very annoying. I usually have to end up closing the bathroom door so that it will help it go off. My dad says I should turn the fan on in the kitchen downstairs to get some air going through the house, and it works, but I don't nessecarilly like walking around the house in a towel while the windows are open and people are home. I wouldn't mind so much doing it when people weren't home, because when people are home they usually come out of their bedrooms usually half asleep and annoyed that the alarm is going off again. I don't like this because I'm in a towel and they see me standing there half naked and then I get pissed off. But that didn't happen today because I shut off the alarm early."

"event","whenever I hear any great piano music I get inspired to play again. I used to be really good at the piano. I have a all these piano books that I could play, I just really need to learn how to get better. I have everything down, all I really need to do better is playing things quicker without having to look at each note individualy but rather read the music as a whole.
I love piano.
I want to play the piano really well again... I don't know why I ever stopped, I guess I didn't think I was ever good enough or that my parents would always forced us to go to lessons so I just got stubborn. I stopped taking lessons in the 8th grade, I would have been so good by now! 
Piano has always been a passion of mine. Its relaxing. I love to make my own music.
I prefer to play the piano when nobody is home because I can really play whatever I want. When I was little I never used to like to play when my parents were around because I knew that they were listening and I guess it embarassed me and I didn't want to. I dunno.
Anyway, I always say this, but I am going to start playing piano again. I have the talent, I can definitely work on being great because it really does have the potential to be great.
Another thing is, is when I hear piano music or play piano I feel like myself. I feel the inner me. I feel like I am who I really am supposed to be. And I become completely relaxed and carried away somewhere else. There's something magical about it."

"event","a little over a year or so ago, Ujournal decided to take down its webpage without telling anybody. I used to be part of Ujournal. Ujournal is the same exact thing as Livejournal and Deadjournal. That is what I had before Livejournal. Everyone was angry and freaking out over the loss of their countless memories lost in cyberspace. Fortunately, a very nice guy (or girl) decided to put all of Ujournal onto his own webpage aboutmylife.com so that everybody's ujournal could be retrieved. 
Tonight I am going to take all those entries of mine and save them to my own harddrive. Most of that UJ stuff was from the earlier parts of me and Brad so I would really not like to lose those.
Also looking back and reading those I had really bad writing skills. I still stink at writing but to see how much less mature I was. Really. How embarassing!
Jennifer, Carolyn, and whoever also had UJ as well I would reccomend you do the same, as in copy and paste your entries onto MS word or something. Your accounts will be under:

Maybe I'll just be more firm from now on and say do it yourself. I'm always the one who plans things and its WAY to stressful. People depend on me to make plans.

No I'm not talking about my birthday, because it IS my responsibility, I'm just talking about stuff in general. 
My brother just sparked it that's all.


I'm also $76 overdraft... because of stupid gas... gas is just too expensive to run back and forth to frederick between school and work... I don't earn enough to keep up with it all.

------------------------
I suppose this gives me more time to make my speech a little better and write notecards, I didn't think I would have to since I know how to sew a skirt and I've been doing it for over 5 years, but I still need to say some extra stuff.
I've been awake since like 730 this morning. Last night I felt so sleepy that it made me sick to my stomach. I have never been that sleepy. So I decided to get some sleep in, technically a night time nap, so I set my alarm clock for like 630 so that I would have enough time to finish this skirt and write up a speech. I finished just in time too! 

Its really funny, I am in the computer lab at school, and like all the computer screens have either LJ, Myspace, or IM. Haha. Kids is so boring nowdays =). We're gonna be nearsighted sooner or later because we constantly have our noses in the computer screen.

BTW, I have a myspace now, the username is Nekosan. I also have a new email Neko.BLC@gmail.com   I would prefer that if anyone writes me an email to still use nyonyudejiko@aol.com because I rarely check my gmail account, also because I keep forgetting about it, lol. Well anyway I gotta go work on notecards."

BUT I think I'm gonna get into Idaho! Because if not, then they would have sent the decline letter at the same time. I REALLY hope I get into Idaho. I'm so anxious to get the letter cause I really wanna get in! I've been thinking a lot about it today and I really am actually excited and looking forward to going there for a lot of reasons. The only reason I'm not getting really excited yet or really thinking about it much is because I don't want to get my hopes up and be disapointed.
That is why I applied to MD too. Just incase something happens with Idaho... and that is the ONLY reason. Is for backup. It is not because I wanna stay around here like my parents and some other people might think, I know better. It's only 4 months away from home and I'm gonna come back, I can deal with it. Its not like I'll be losing friends I'm close to. I promise, that's the ONLY reason I applied to MD is for bakup. Plus it would be stupid to not go to a college where I already know 4 other people who I'll be with, and more coming next year.

For the two of you sleeping down here... EVERY SINGLE WORD OF THIS SONG ...I love you:

Chip and Jennifer:

For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

I'm everything I am
Because you loved me"

I knew I was going to dinner with all of them but I was at the mall today looking to see if FanClub came back because this is about the time it opened last year... But like I went past Deb and just for fun I was looking at the dresses, and I found this really really pretty dress, and I tried it on, and it looks so good! So later Jennifer and I went back up to frederick to get it. 
While we were at JCP we were in the jounior's section and all of the sudden we heard this guy go OOOOOWW!!!!!!!! and we turn around and there's this dad hunched over holding his nuts and his son and I guess his son had killed his dad's nuts somehow, and the kid is all like like ""sorry daddy.... Sorry daddy...."" the kid was so innocent too.... but Jennifer and I ran to the dressing room so he wouldn't hear us laughing our butts off!!!! We were in there laughing so hard and then we had to get out of that section because we were laughing so hard!!!

But now I don't wanna eat for the next 3 days so that I will feel super comfortable in the dress... even though I just ate 3 pieces of joe corbi's pizza but I didn't really eat much today anyway so I'm alright.

I change clothes between my tennis class and my speech class, I was wearing my otakon shirt to tennis but I had a feeling I shouldn't change it, besides I was comfortable in it and I didn't get too sweaty because it was a nice day out this morning. So anyway at the end of my speech class this girl comes up to me and said she was at otakon so we talked for a little bit about things otaku talk about. So I guess I have made a new friend and I guess that's why I wore it instead of changing. She said she saw my FLCL shirt because I wore it sometime last week but she didn't know if I was into anime because like sometimes people get anime shirts without being into anime just because they're cute shirts. 

Um what was I going to say.

I am almost ready... suddenly it all came to me and I understood all this stuff, I don't know why but it always seems to happen, and I'm glad it happened BEFORE the test hah. I am hoping for a B at least. But I am aiming for an A as always. I will be OK with a C but I won't let that happen. But who knows, its hard stuff... as long as I know I did the best I could. I am not going to compare myself with anybody except for me, and I will know that I was successful, even if I get an F.

A little sad last night, back to normal now, at least I hope so. Sometimes life has its little dissapointments but I am constantly looking at the good side in things. You should be grateful for what you have, because that's all that matters. I have been blessed with so many people who love me and so many things in life that will always make me happy.

After tonight I will have ALL WEEK TO PLAY FF7 AND DO WHATEVER I WANT CAUSE THERE WILL BE NO MATH HOMEWORK BWAHAHA!! This week is gonna rock. AND I get to sew a skirt for my speech class which will be fun.

"event","OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! I just noticed my old computer has USB 2.0! and now I can burn DVDs and transfer files reeeeeeeeeeally fast! We've had this computer about 3 and a half years and I just now saw it. This is so cool! Now I can make this computer all nice and fixed, just like what I did with my laptop last week. I reinstalled the OS, but first I needed to take everything off the computer that I needed onto this 300GB hard drive that I got too. 

I really should be going to bed. I'm so tired. But I want to burn dvds now. Final Fantasy 7 has been  draining all my concentration and depriving me of sleep. It's soo addictive! Saturday night I thought I was done playing for the night at like 3, I looked at the clock when I went to bed and it was 530... and I got 3 hours of sleep because we have early morning church now. And I didn't take a nap sunday. I'm still suffering from it but its ok.

There's this cricket that is chirping loud and its in the house.

I am extremely happy though. Now I am going to burn a DVD. Probably Utena.

Last saturday I agreed to work for this girl for her. I've worked a saturday night twice before and I HATED it. I didn't think it would be that bad since it wasn't summer anymore. OH NO. IT WAS JUST AS BAD. Let me tell you. I'm used to working in a clean environment where I actually have the time to keep the equiptment/work area neat and tidy and clean. I like that, a lot. But night shifts, especially saturdays, nobody has time to clean. And when I pick up a spade it is all slimey with ice cream and then it slips when I make the ice cream. I hate it. At one point I was so frustrated and annoyed that I had to step outside and walk around for about 3 minutes before I could go back in. Oh I was so mad. I think also because I really did not want to be there in the first place and that I had homework I should be doing instead of making stupid ice cream. At least I got $30 out of it and she let me off an hour early. I love Liz my manager. She'll be 21 next month. She's only a year older than me. She COULD be my friend but she's a manager and its weird.

And WOW this thing is burning so fast.

What's with these stupid bugs down here? There's this wolf jumping spider thing to the left of me, and a beetle to my right, and I saw a roach which was really gross but it was dead near the stairs, and then this cricket that's chirping really loudly and he bothers me the least because I don't mind crickets as much as these freaky spider things.

Maybe my laptop will burn dvds much faster now because its on a fresh OS. I think there must've been something going on with the driver for the dvd burner OR just the entire computer was completely hosed.

Another beetle. I put my feet off the ground I don't want them touching me.

Today I woke up late for my tennis class. I didn't mean to, my mom woke me up at 929 and asked me when I needed to wake up and as soon as she asked my alarm went off. It was cool. It was also cool last night when I set my alarm I had a feeling I should set it a minute earlier, and the reason I had that feeling was because my mom was gonna wake me up then. Weird. But then I set my alarm for 15 minutes more sleep but I guess I slept through it, my mom comes in at 1035 which is when I should have LEFT for school. So I was about 20 minutes late. It's ok though. 
We did this impromptu speech in my speech class and the teacher would give us a random topic to talk about, and when she called on me I had no idea what she was going to ask me to speak about. She asked me to talk about... BRAIDING HAIR! That's like MY thing! Some of the things she asked other students to talk about were hard, but she gave me the perfect one, my speech was great and I was proud of myself.

DVD is done burning. That was really fast. If it was my laptop with the way it was before, it would still be at like, 5%... I'm not kidding.

So Chip and I went to D.E. and we were both really tired. We both have another class afterwards but not the same one, and we both decided just to skip. So we went to coldstone and got fruity ice cream and then went back to his house and played with google earth. That's the coolest map program. It's going to be the new mapquest. 

We got this idea to go to anime expo. I've been wanting to go there for years. It's in CA. Right near disney land and right near the beach. It's going to be so fun. This is a serious thought. It hasn't been so serious in the past. Now I really want to do it. If we have at least 6 people come, the hotel rate won't be that bad as usual. The rates out there aren't bad at all. It's just plane tickets. The only thing is we won't have a rental car, so we'd have to use the bus/taxi everywhere but that's ok.
Anybody up for joining?"

"event","well I haven't updated in like forever, but I guess I'll start up again. I know I always say that, but I'll really try this time. It's a good way to get things out. 

It's been a month now. One long, depressing, bloody month. 
It's fall now. Summer ended yesterday, or today, depending on if you want to look at the sunsets or not. 
I decided to let everything go. They said I would feel different in a month. I didn't start feeling different until maybe 3 days ago. Weird how things happen. I refused to believe that I would feel different, I wouldn't let myself. 

I have a life or death situation coming up in the next month that I gotta deal with. If you don't know what it is don't worry about it until the time comes when you'll know because you will most likely hear about it if all goes to hell. I am really really scared. I just can't win. Really. I can't stress myself about it until that time comes. But I need to prepare... if there is anything more important than anything I've ever done in my life to this point, it is this. I know that this sounds confusing to anybody that doesn't know what I'm talking about, but LJ is for the writer, right?

I have another problem that nobody knows about that just came up today. I feel very bad about. I need to fix it ASAP. I need to fix myself ASAP. And to the person it concerns, I had no idea. But in my case, It could have happened to anybody. I'm sorry.

I really need to be more of a careful person. My narrcisist reign can be over now. Thank you to all who have helped. Now I need to start caring about others. I'm sorry mom for not caring about you only 20 days after your breakdown. Now I can help you. I'm sorry if you really needed me, I needed you too and we just couldn't let eachother in because of our own problems. I'm sorry if you really don't need me as much as you did but I hope you understand.

Jennifer you don't need to feel bad about feeling like you've not been around much like you've said, but truthfully, all you needed to do is just exist. I didn't even notice what you had said about how you felt. The greatest thing was that you were there that first day and you stayed up with me, as tired as you were. And listening. Out of 15 years, all I need is to think of you and you're already there.

Chip, I seriously owe you one. You do not know how much you've done for me. not in a million years. I wish I could do something to help you, I see how stressed you are and I feel like I need to do somethng for you and be helping you like you did for me. You helped me up so much. I think that the reason I've gotten back up on my feet so quickly is because of all the things that you said that were so true. How do you do it? I just wish I could have been there and done the same for you back when you were having your breakdown with steve.

TT, you and I share a lot. We have more in common than I would have thought. I think we're closer now in a way, I love you and so glad I have you as a brother to look out for me and for me to look out for. I'm sorry I didn't look out for you but I guess its just the other person thought the other was a perfect child. But we both see its not that way. I know that in the next couple months you will be going through what I just went through... I will do all in my power to help you keep your head up. I can't handle the thought of my brother in tears and I know its inevitable. Take your time, let it burn, but I hope I can get you through this.

Brad... I'm sorry. I just really don't know what to say but thank you for 3 years of us. There is nothing that I will ever regret about our time together. The things that we did together I will never forget. You were my first everything. I don't know how its gonna be to see you next time without your loving look in your eyes. I hope by then it won't hurt. I know it hurt you to see me in that condition last time you saw me. I hated not looking at you being in love. It's the saddest thing ever. I just hope you find someone who loves you as much and even more than I did. I mean it. Because somebody deserves everything you can ever give to a person, all the love, kindness, gentleness, fun and joy that I know you posess. There is somebody out there for you. 


These are only words for everyone. A feeling is worth an infinite number of words. There are no words to express a feeling. This is the best I can do. Thank you everyone."

"event","I officially hate aol. Not that I didn't hate it before, but this is the last straw. This is the NEW AND IMPROVED AOL. I guess I never cared about junk mail to notice that aol only saves emails for one month and then they're automatically deleted. Well, a little over a month ago I cleared out my cellphone of all my pictures that I had so that I could have space for pictures of Texas. Well I just thought about saving them to my computer, so I went into aol and they were GONE. Well I would have done it sooner except that since we got rid of dialup I don't have to use AOL anymore and I put off saving those pictures and I forgot. The thing that irritates me the most though is that it cost me 50 dollars to send them to myself... and AOL got rid of them. 50 dollars down the drain. I am so angry. <i>other</i> internet providers <i>don't</i> delete emails after a month."

"event","I had a dream last night and it lasted like 5 hours, it was like a movie or something. I just woke up so I figure I should write it down, it was so detailed: 
All this takes place sometime in the future I guess, like within a few years.

It stars off with me witnessing a murder.
The murderer was a black guy, glasses, tall, short haircut.
He said that was going to kill me too if I told anyone what I saw.
He attempted to stab me and threw a knife, I was sitting at the bottom of some concrete twisty staircase, like a staircase in a lighthouse. The knife missed me.
He then bribed me with a check for 18,000 dollars if I didn't tell anyone.
I felt the need to get out of the area quickly I guess because I didn't want the police to ask my anything and I did not want to be killed.
I also needed to change my identity. 
I needed to break up with brad but he didn't know why since I couldn't tell anyone about the murder and my identity change. 
I was watching the dream in my head and found out he was going to do the same thing I was, but my character didn't know that. Only me who was watching the dream knew it.
And I was watching it in my head and I cried and cried and cried.
So I changed my identity and moved to texas

apparently brad moved to texas too cause he had to get out of the area because he was so upset over me and decided the easiest way to get over it was get away and fall in love with another girl but he still missed me.
meanwhile I went into the city to buy some new clothes, I wanted to get to know some other guys, and there was this real nice lookin guy, and we went on a little date. The guy was really Brad, but I didn't know this at the time. And he didn't know that this new girl was really me either.
I kept seeing the murder guy, I guess he was checking up on me to make sure I wasn't gonna tell anyone, and it was really scary.
There was a little girl in a house with a big room looking out the window and it looked like she was trapped in her house because she wasn't allowed out.
Later on I started making friends with a girl from Salt Lake City. She had just recently moved and she didn't know what was around Texas, and I told her there was a Sonic, but she said she knew that already.
Then we started talking and said something in japanese which meant ""are you interested in anything else"" and if I undertood it it meant I was otaku, and so she was otaku and that was cool.
I got together with 4 other girls, and went to some chicken restaurant and I ate some really good chicken.
I was afraid they would find out I knew something about the murderer, but they didn't. I guess the murderer was already known throught the country.

I ran into the guy (that was really brad) and we went on another date this time a little more serious. And he thought to himself that he really likes this new girl and it really reminded him of me and he still really misses me. 
I went to this woman's house house who was in her 30s, she invited to her house for a dinner picnic, She asked me which side of texas I was on. There was a french side and some other side I couldn't remember. I said I guess I was on the french side because I knew french, and she said I couldn't do that because this was serious and a war might break out. 
Eating with us was the same little girl as before that wasn't allowed out of her house.
Her mother went inside the house, little girl quickly got together with 4 other kids and did some weird spell thing and apparent;y I could warn them inside my head that her mother was coming back outside. It was cool cause they were doing some sort of final fantasy looking water move, but there were crosses.
I guess part my new identity was a ballerina, and a bunch of dancers from across the region were getting together for a big party.
some cowboy gang (including the murderer, but dressed as a cowboy) came in ruined all the fun and came in there and split us all into two groups of about 100. we were going to play a big war thing and we got into this huge circle. Then it turned into a ballet compitition, there was kaitlyn and she was in this dark blue costume, and a girl Sakura, and sydney had to help her. and she ended up winning.


I never found out what happened in this story, because I woke up. I'm really glad it was just a dream though, but it was like a little movie. Well the ending that I would like to have which is what I think I was leaning towards was:
-I end up telling the police about the murder guy, I end up keeping the money, the murder guy finds out I know about him, he doesn't kill me but almost kills me. 
-the little girl gets freedom.
-the war between the two clans in the area of texas gets settled.
-I eventually find out that the guy I am with is really brad and he finds out it is really me, and we are both really happy that it is really us and we are together again."

Actually I kinda always wanted to work at an ice cream shop. It's so cute. It's a long drive but I'm only gonna be working there like 2 or 3 times a week I hope, becuse I don't want to work a lot during the summer because that would sux0r. I just need money for Otakon and if I go to the beach with peoples this summer need money.

so yesterday was my first time clubbing; we went to the baja beach club at the inner harbor. I already knew christa and dave but her friends megan, parker, jen, jason and john were there too. It was fun dancing sometimes but I was too paranoid about other guys coming up behind me and trying to freak dance with me, and whenever someone tried to do that one of the people in our group would help push them away. but it was fun. my eyes were starting to burn because of all the cigarette smoke. near then end I was like haha to all the drunk people starting to feel not so good. so we left there at about 130 but didn't get out of the parking garage till like 3 because it was so backed up. all the drunk people thought it was hillarious to have everybody in the garage honk their horns at the same time. We decided to go to waffle house. It's cool driving 70 at that time of night because there was nobody on the road for about a half hour, we only passed like 2 cars. So we went to the waffle house which was very cool.  I was originally supposed to sleep at christa's, but instead she dave and I crashed over at john's house."

"event","When I was little I really wanted to be a dancer, or a cheerleader, or a gymnist, or a figure skater, or anything cool like that. In kindergarten my parents signed me up for ballet, and it was cool, but I don't know why they took me out of it. I really wish I had stayed. Later on in my elementary years I remember asking again but we were very low on money so I couldn't. Then in 6th grade I took a gymnastics class. I felt I was too old then for it so I quit.
I was only 11 years old! If I didn't quit I would have had 8 years in, and would be a very very good gymnist by now. And I still feel young, I'm only 19. 
I took several dance classes along the way too but I still had the same problem of knowing I was too old to learn anything and most of the kids were way above me and they were younger.
I still have so much desire to be a dancer, not so much a gymnist or cheerleader (eww. cheerleading lasted only till the 4th grade lol) But I was talking to emily and she's right, that I am only 19, and by the time I get to being like 25, I would say geez 19 was 6 years ago, I wish I would have taken dance and gotten 6 years into it and 25 is still young.
So I think I am going to look into finding an adult dance class and just go from there. And it will be fun. Anyone want to join me?

They say that when you have kids, nothing matters about yourself anymore. Like everything you do is for your kids. And I will want the best for my kids. So if I have a daughter I'm going to put her into dance class or something like that, or put her into any kind of class she wants. Even a son, make sure he doesn't regret not being good at something he wishes he had been. That way I will be proud of them the same way I would be proud of myself, and life will be good.

I'm really glad I stayed in piano for 8 years though, because the worst thing than wishing I was better is regretting never learning."

I would have been very sad if I missed it cause I really wanted to go. I was thinking before I even signed up for this class that it would be cool to go back there. We used to go there every year for field trips for elementary school. 5th grade we didn't go into the planetarium part just in the science lab part. I remember it being really big in the planetarium part. This was 10 years ago. It shrunk! everyone else that went there as a kid thought so too. seriously, it was huge to us back then. But it brought back lots of memories. It was fun. It still smelled the same too haha. It is in south frederick elementary.  I guess the kids are used to other schools coming to their schools, but they were probably wondering why there were a bunch of college kids there. I think it was the same guy that ran the shows back then too."

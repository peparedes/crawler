"event","Ahh a most fortunate tide for me, this month the moon has brought me a new roomate:)
It looks as though Trevor is returning from new york, and it didnt take much persuasion to get him to sign on board at the old depew ct. :D
 i am excited about living with him, i been his neigbor so long and i think that amongst the very best part of living with freinds is getting to know them better, deepening the rapport, i am curious as to how he will find denver this time around. hes not beeen gone to long but things change so fast.
   such a releife it is, i now only need to fill the space at the shop, hopefully things will work out with Rauol why in the end i could cut down on a 1000 bucks of my raging monthly bills.  I havent been digging in them so long as to yet feel them looming overhead, but i can imagine that as time progresses that thay just might be a source of stress, for now the are like exciting little permissions."

"event","ahh i got my sign out front of the shop today, each task that falls into place provides a further sence of ownership, jon came in the shop today and i started to teach him some stuff. watching him learn and looking back i realize just how much information and how complex the whole process really is. I remember when my hand shook like that, was it confidence or control or the way one affected the other more like. 

 I sent andyo a care package filled it with the precious sacred glow in the dark trisaritops shirt, and lots of cookies, and some toilet paper, and the ""im beautyful inside "" sign which jessi stole for me, i sent as well a shirt i had scince i was 14, which is equaly as old as andys shirt, she said when fuming on the phone to me"" i bet you havent owned anything since you were six! "" which she was probably right about, however, i had 2 shirts that were as old as hers,i thought about giving her my lady death shirt, but i love it too much, i still wear it and will wear it into tatters. Andy has often exuded a charm i find kindred to Death's own, i sure hope in passing that i may be greeted by such a cheery beautyful continence."

"event","My intentions are imaculate, my actions are righteous, my aspirations are peace of mind, 

my dreams are cursed 

i awake each day seeing how stuck i am 

by noon i have left much behind, into the evening i could care less, most times not at all, but in the morning, i arise from these dreams which leave me feeling,,, the extra sensory conection, I want out, however my psyche has plans of its own. 

forgive us our tresspeses and help us to forgive those who tresspess against us.

i understand that my feelings need to graze through this time, passing through milling, and migrating on. My understanding has a vantage across these slow felt compelxities, it stymes the tides of fury and hatred, it sheperds my actions, but it can not solve this dreaming conundrum. 
    oft suggested has been pscho therapy, but what ales me is not by any means understanding, i understand it all to intimately well, i see just how satisfying this banquett must taste to each of them, how their very disposition could do little but to bring them to this feast. They feast. and i resent. with such sinister aplume.  i need to heal. each passing murderous rage reminds me, but understanding doesnt seem to aid in healing, only deeper reservoirs of colder waters. 
      furys have focused me, of this i am sure, that with this i have conjured into manifestation the avenues of my new life. 

heavan , heaven is a place , a place where nothing , nothing ever happens 

   my sister has some fucked up health shit going on she just had her gall bladder taken out and she keeps having painful attacks when ever she eats any food with any fatty content, i shivered when she told me that they were taking her gall bladder out , as i understood it the gall bladder is the stomachs governer, not to be lightly disposed of, however she was told that it was a necrotic bag of sludge which played swiftly in her choice to remove it, along with the expectation of being no further plauged.
   unfortunately she is still suffering from gall bladder attacks,  even without the organ,  
     western medicine if so frigging lame, it dont work right lets remove it, whats that you say, your not better? 

got me ta thinking about Aarron , he found out he had lung cancer about 6 weeks ago then died about 2 weeks ago, inbetween, 4 weeks ago, he got married."

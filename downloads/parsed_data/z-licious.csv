The party last nigth was great fun, save for that it pretty much split into two groups: Braden, Laura, Lily, Heather, and Matt in the basement, with Shawn and Andy upstairs playing X-Men Legends in the livign room.  And thus springs up my dilemma.  Movies and DDR in the basement, or beating the shit out of things as Rogue in Legends.  
I split my time between the two, smearing Braden in DDR, watching a few shows, and then crawling back upstairs to... beat the shit out of things as Rogue.  Rather than watching the ball drop to welcome in teh new year, I was dropping members of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.
I suppose that shows where my priorities lie."

"event","Goodness, it's been some time since I updated this.
Christmas hit me like an old woman behind the wheel of a station wagon.  Right when I least expected it, and was gone as if she hadn't noticed me under her tires.  
Ahem.
This year, I was blessed with assorted panties, purple space boots, longsleeved shirts, Hello Kitty action figures, one My Little Pony of the new variety, posters of fuckable males, and a new laptop to replace the one that has failed me, and was therefore handed off to my father.
I'd say that's a pretty decent haul.  In exchange for these gifts, I bought my father a poker chip set in an alumium case, and for my mother, I painted a picture of a portion of the French Quarter of NOLA.
After the exchange of presents, the family and I drove two hours to visit my cousins in Ohio, which was pleasant, save for my aunt's head injury.  Ech.
All in all, it was a good relief after aunt Catherine's funeral on Wednesday, and sorely needed.  
I've been pretty lazy over break, painting, listening to music, playing with the dog, and sleeping at least 12 hours a day.  It's very nice to be home, and I find it far more relaxing than foundations and dorm drama!
New years/Birthday resolution:  Let people do whatever the hell they want, sit back and watch, do not partake."

Mom: you crack me up, cookie!
we made silly putty today during reading.
i wanted to shoot myself.

Me:*purrs*
Oh my.
Why so?

Mom: i was wearing a new sweater.. playing with Elmer's glue and food coloring. the kids had ziploc bags of it in front of me and they were squeezing it so hard that the bags were breaking and the stuff was oozing and spraying out.

Me: *laughs* You entertain spedly youth.
not a pretty sight.
I'd imagine not.

Mom: they were so very happy to have their very own silly putty, though.
doesn't take much to make them happy.

Me: I guess so. More than their parents ever give them, probably.

Mom: to be sure. this week we had a kidnapping incident at (her school name here). a mother enrolled her child on tuesday. dad showed up on wednesday with custody papers and said he hadn't seen the child in 3 years. mom had a warrant for her arrest so when she showed up with the child the police were called and they took her away.
never a dull moment.

Me : Wow. I heard that there was a brawl at McDowell as well.
11:20 PM
Mom: how did you hear that? i didn't hear anything.

Me: I heard it from Ken Town. Who heard it from Maria.

Mom: Did you hear scott peteerson was convicted of killing his wife and unborn child?

Me: Yep. Shouldn't have taken this long. I would have had that asshole shot far sooner than this.

Mom: here here.

Me: But, you know, with Bush and his ""Christian Morals"", we shouldn't be killing anyone.
this is going to be a scary four years.

Me: Jesus would be ashamed of people like him. I know I'd be pissed if someone used my name to murder thousands of people.

Mom: Bush doesn't seem to undertand separation of church and state.
pretty soon we will be quoting from the bible after saying the pledge every morning.
you realize he has been born again.
*mutters*

Me:  Prayer does nto make you a good person. Being a good person makes you a good person.

Mom: well said.
i am going to call it a night. Dad is out of town tonight . I was with him at a meeting in Titusville but he had to stay so i xcame home. he'll be back tomorrow. Did you get my card?

Me:  Mrr, not yet. Sleep well.

"event","Since replies are frozen, here is my response to the possible accusation of myself as the anonymous Poster O' Doom (tm).  

You know me.  If I say something, I damn well want people to know that it was me.  I've been pretty quiet to you all through this for a good reason. And you're right.  So much for people being your friends.  You never seem to listen to anyone but yourself.  We all (and do correct me if I'm wrong, Other People Involved) feel that we've got reasons to stay away.  If you're happy with Justin, why care what anyone else has to say about it?  While we may not agree with what went on, it's YOUR life.  Everyone's bad choices are the things that have turned Tefft into a raunchy soap opera. 
As for me?  And why I'm not pissed at Braden?  I don't know, sometimes.  For a long time (and he knows this) My opinion of him was VERY low.  But through time and forgivness, we've gotten to the point of having a wonderful friendship.  I would never trust him romantically, but I enjoy his company and speaking with him.  (Even if I'm right and he's wrong ;)  ) But that aside, it is difficult to let things die when it is continuously brought up.  My advice on the matter, whether you wish it or not, would be to stop worrying about everyone who no longer wants anything to do with you and be happy with what you've got."

That barely stale bun with a little chew to it.  My gramma's backyard, cousins all around, a Sprite at my side, and the dogs chasing one another.  
Mm.   Summer of 97.  Being in good shape, a little withdrawn, but... wow.  Those were good times.  
11 was a good age for me.  I was still a tomboy, and a little weirdo, but all was good.  Maybe it's just looking back and rememebring good times, you know?  I wish that I could go back and have those days again, with my whole family being here, cousins pretending that we were mountain lions or wolves, tearing apart the couches to make out dens, deciding territory with water balloons and cake.  
I miss Easter Egg hunts. Those were the best.  This time of year, I really crave one.  I remember that one year, my aunt and mother filled over 350 eggs for the four of us kids to hunt down.  Plastic cats, coins, candies... 
Just last year, we found an egg on our property that had a collapsed Reese's cup in it.

"event","I just bawled my eyes out over an apisode of Futurama.  
I love that show.  I watch it most nights that it's on, and it's pretty damn funny.
However, today the main character, Fry, found his dog, who had been frozen in time just as he was, and eventaully ended up an a museum.  Long story short, he was almost able to clone the dog, complete with memories.  However, he found out that the dog had been frozen at the age of fifteen, not three like he had thought.  Having only owned the pup until he was three, Fry assumed that his pet had lived a full, happy life and been frozen by accident...  And, not wanting to ruin that for his former best friend, decided not to clone him.  
But, cutting back to the past, you find that all the dog did with the last twelve years of his life was wait for his master to come home.  Seasons passed, his surroundings changed, and after all that time, eventually he just lay down to sleep and didn't wake up.  
I cried for about half an hour while I hugged my dog.  
I love my dog.  More that I'll probably love any human in the near future.  Always happy to see me, loving and affectionate, sleeps on my bed.  Cute and sweet, fun to be around, and keeps me from being sad or lonely.  I love this critter.  If I lost him, I don't know what I would do.   
Every time I go into one of these crying things, I try to think of the last time that I did it.  Last time it happened for me was seeing the end of ""Big Fish"", which was what, two months ago?  And no one seemed to believe that I cried.  Not my best friend, not my boyfriend.  Just the buddy I went to see it with who had to ask me (through running mascara and behind a jacket) if I were all right.  We both cried.  
I dunno.  Emotionally, I'm usually pretty balanced, But when it comes to animals, especially dogs... I don't know.  Watching people get killed on TV is such a common thing these days that it doesn't even faze me, but animals mean a hell of a lot more to me than the majority of people in the world.  Animals, unless you do something stupid, will not hate you.  
People often say that man is above or better than the other inhabitants of our planet.  
This is crap.
You can deny it all you want, but we're just animals, whether you like it or not.  Despite our intellegence (which, after a day in certain high school classes I question), we're still mammals.   We enjoy socializing with other living things.  We build dens and have families.  We acquire mates.  
Personally, I'm proud to be an animal.  Because a good deal of humanity just pisses me off.  
In my next life, I want to be the puppy of a kid who will love me just as much as I love my dog."

"event","Some things that I rememebr just seem to pop up at the oddest times.  According to my psychology class, you never truly forget things embedded in your permanent memory, but sometimes, you lose the means of finding them.  And these memories can be triggered by cterain stimuli, be it sight or smell or whatnot.  
For me, I guess I have a few of these that are seasonal.
Hay reminds me of craft fairs I went to with my mother when I was a little girl.  I can even remember some of the things that were being sold, though I can't remember the faces of the sellers.  
Another is carving pumpkins on a cold October night and roasting the seeds.  
Having a campfire with my cousins and writing our names with the smoke from half-burned sticks.  Alot of camp memories.  A certain red crawfish.  Roasting marshmallows over a stove when it was too rainy out to HAVE a fire.  The smell of wet leaves, mud, and bugs.  
Sometimes, I find memories that must be from dreams, like a certain house isolated out in the woods, surrounded by green grass and pine trees.  But just past the trees and forest is an oceanside community... and dragons.  
So I'm assuming that's from a dream.  
I dunno.  I just love having htese.  It reminds me of something I read in a book involving Hannibal Lecter... that he had a memory palace that he went through to keep himself amused...

I think I'll put X2 on the new HDTV while I read over VOX (Literary magazine) submissions, type out craploads of vocabulary for communications (Lavaliere mike- Small microphone worn on the clothing, often attatched to a collar or tie.  Advantages: small and easy to use, omnidirectional.  Disadvantages: may rub against clothing audibly.), and reading reveiws of a book I have to write a report about.  
Mmmph.   Really, that's not too bad, but when I'm RPing while I'm doing these tasks, it could take alot longer.  I may just stick to one window rather than my customay four.
I really miss the old plots on XMM.  Before the retcon screwed everything up for me.  It isn't fun to get a ""What FUCK do you think you're doing"" email.  Staff knew, and I didn't think they had a problem with it.  I guess it's a matter of the RIGHT staff knowing?  
However, on EVOmoo, there was a small problem with what I was sort of doing.  Yes, I'll admit I made a mistake.  But rather than accosting me, staff just politely asked me what I was doing, and I felt GUILTY about even thinking of doing anything I shouldn't be.

I love it.
The sky is velvety, no one's outside, everything's quiet.

I guess nights like this, all calm, make me think of all the things I miss.   I miss family members who have dies, I miss how I was before I became an internet junkie, and I miss being in really good shape.  I miss camping, I miss having imaginary friends, and making movies with real ones.  
But at the same time, I like being me.  A young woman who is beginning to become really secure and happy with who she is.  I'm losing wieght.  I have a really great guy.  I am a talented artist.  
But I don't like how I've sort of jumped back into my reclusive habits.  When I go out with friends, once or twice a week, I do enjoy myself.   But I'm a daydreamer, and my thoughts are always wandering.

I can deal with this.  Because I am a decent looking geek and I have a boyfriend, so I know that, even though I am addicted to online roleplaying games, I am not going to die alone.  
I am so obsessed that I will log into games even if:
A. They have silly rules.  For example, a game I quit recently had a friggin SPEED LIMIT.  On how fast you could travel between rooms.  You had to count to twenty before you could move...
B. They have poor organization.  I'm in it for the people, man.  Not the staff.  ANOTHER game I quit awhile back had horrible staff.  The game was just their personal playground.  Only enforcing rules if/when they felt like it, breaking their own rules and HARRASSING THE PLAYERS THAT THEY APPROVED.
C. They have shitty PLAYERS.  Not a lot, mind you.  Usually it's one or two people out of twenty hu rite liek this!!!1111 Or they give poses such as ""Johnny sits and watches.""  That's it. Nothing more.  All Johnny is doign is sitting and writing four word poses.  But it takes him about ten to fifteen minutes to type this.  He also will tell you he's in four other windows at the moment.  He makes me want to kill kittens with rubber bands.  No, not kittens.  Possibly frogs.  Because I like kittens.

What's the DRAW here?  There are no pictures.  I am an artist, and there are no images involved!  How could this text be so entrancing?  If not for it, I'm sure I'd be in better shape!  Have seen the world!  Drawn more naked men- eep!  
I wonder if I can somehow wire my laptop through the treadmill... 
But I do know why I play.  A good number of these people are fantastic writers.  They think out complicated plots.  I need to be on edge, writing to the best of my abilities.  I must think up new and interesting things to say and do.  Not only that, but there are only the limits places on me by my mortal imagination.  I can be a superhero, or a dog.  Whatever I want.  I can wine and dine in New York City, or I can raise the dead in New Orleans.  
And I can save it and read it later.
I love to write.  Even if it isn't my main skill, or what I'm recognized for.
I need to get to sleep.  Five hours of sleep ain't cutting it to make it through seven hours of my B-day classes... only one and a half of which I like.
I need chocolate covered expresso beans if I'm gonna make it through AP English.  At least it's ""work make up"", so classes are shortened.
Death."

"event","Have you ever been up all night only to take in a breath of air and get that tingly smell?  The one that follows a runny nose and smells distincly sick?  And you go, ""Aw CRAP.   Now I'm gonna to be sniffling around for days with one nostril plugged up, coughing and hacking and generally looking like hell.""
I just did that.  
Thought I must admit that if not for the limitations of my school schedule, I WOULD be noctournal.  My optimum functioning hours would be between 5PM and 9AM.
I have been up all night RP'ing, contemplating the completion of a commission (which is very nearly done), procrastinating the scanning in of images I did for a school fundraiser, and staring blearily at the big acrylic that I'll most likely not finish any time soon.   
And I bought more brushes for that thing, too.  
I need to find a place to store all my images where I can retrieve them for this journal as well.  
Later today, my male is taking me out for a Valentine's Day Steak extravaganza.  Unfortunately, my family (myself included) has devoured the four dozen cookies I made for him in a matter of... four days.  This roughly breaks down to four cookies a day for each of us, less if the dog is more clever than I give him credit for.  Speaking of the dog, he looks rather pissed at me right now.  Probably because he sleeps twenty hours a day and I'm keeping him from doing so.

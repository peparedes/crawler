A girl who wasn't even involved in the issue has made it her own and hates me. Oh well. Loving my iPod and daydreaming way to much. Hoping that the Monday issue gets resolved easily. Also hoping that I don't get terrbly screwed by jac's mother's irresponsibility.

"event","This journal has been, up until now, more or less a failure. I do have an actual handwritten journal, but that is saved for the details that are far too...well, detailed, to put on here.
Today, work was...eventful.
Good day, then drama. 
Tears.
Fun work.
Employee of the month reception.
Leaving early.
Nap.
Idol.
Reading through out.

Who is obsessed with Nearly Famous? 
I am. Terribly. I have watched it all the way through, all six episodes, four times. I was having withdraws when I couldn't watch it while I was at work. It's just really an excellent British television show that I wish would have done better and gotten more known than it did. 

In the event that anyone reads my journal, I'll give you a quick synopsis of the show. It follows four students, a musician, Owen, a writer, Lila, an actress, Kate, and a behind the scenes type, Joe, as they enter and go through their first year at a fictional performing arts school called Salinger. It just follows all the snags they four friends hit. Drama, alcohol, love, and violence. It just makes for compelling tv, mixed with an excellent soundtrack.

That being said, Aaron Johnson, aka Owen, or Robbie, in Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, is an absolute babe, and his looks, as well as his voice, are taking over my life. All of these episodes are available on youtube. If you'd rather download, I found them when I looked it up on torrentscan, AT&PS as well. Watch, love, and gossip.

My family life is interesting. My mother and I fight horribly, but days later pretend it was nothing. My dad is very sick, but we talk about wrestling, and I think we might be closer than we were a year ago. My sister is just awesome, and we share randomly funny things with each other constantly. My Grandma is losing her memory quickly, but she absolutely loves when we visit her. It's just sad, and difficult for me, but I'm working on it.

My friends are beyond amazing. Although some of them, not naming names, sweat the small stuff too much. But for the most part, solid people.

This year looks great:

March: Caitlin is visiting
April: Alternative Press Tour, three dates.
May: NFG, then Alternative Press Tour in Ohio, with the lovely Erin.
June: Sam should be visiting.
July: Open for suggestions
August: Warped

That's right, a lot to be happy about. So, there it is, a proper post."

i am alone.


edit// 10:45pm
i can't say that i didn't see a break up coming, i just didn't think it would happen at 3am today.  i can honestly say, it's better for us not to be together, now that my thinking is a bit clearer.  we were driving eachother mad, most of it coming from my end, and that really isn't healthy.  i'm sad and upset, because this is my first relationship that actually met something to me, the first actual one since i've been out of high school. the first, and it's hard.  

in the end, i hope that we can be friends.  but right now, i'm a little bit too much all about me, and my feelings to be able to do that.  hopefully, though, we'll be able to hang out and laugh about how stupid we both were toward the end of this.  but right now, all i can do is stop, think about it being over, and then cry.  but eventually that will stop, and i'll contact him, if he hasn't beaten me to it.

as for today, i spent the day laying on the couch in the living room watching tv, and randomly checking the internet, as well as informing friends of the event.  i also took a three and a half hour nap barely two hours after i woke up.  i believe i may have surfaced to the upstairs once, to see that my mom wasn't here.  i had no water, and no food.  being this sad sucks, and makes it hard to accomplish life. hopefully tomorrow is better.

this week doesn't look too good though.  i'm not going to warped tour because i don't want to spend the money, and i've seen all the bands that i want to see play better shows than they will play in this weather at warped tour.  but i'm not going to work, i'm getting a root canal. super yay!  but natali does get home this week.  we're going to make homemade pizza and go to worlds of fun and get gym memberships.  i'm looking forward to living with my sister.

-peace."

"event","i just blew up at my mom and told her she was 'drugged up.'
and do i care?
no, not at all. as a matter of fact, i don't give a flying fuck. about anything, or anyone.
i want it all to end.
nothing has meaning for me anymore.
once upon a time i enjoyed my life. the things i did. the people in it. my family.
but right this instant, i want to disappear. i just want to fall into a hole that never ends.
i'm so sick of headaches and crying. and worrying about what people think about me, but telling myself that i don't care.
because if i actually didn't care, i wouldn't be struggling to lose weight. i wouldn't be showering more, and shaving more. i wouldn't be dressing nicer than i use to. 
but for some reason i changed. and i honestly hate who i've become.
and the sad part? noone cares. noone wants to help me find who i've lost.
sometimes, i just want to say i quit, i give up, i'm done.
but i don't. i just keep on leading this sad, pathetic excuse for a live that i've made myself.
whatever, tomorrow i'll fake a happy, and appease the people around me. pretending the best i can that tonight didn't happen.
pretending that i like my life and that i want to do what i'm doing."

one minute i want to kill eric and i'm sure it's over.
the next i'm head over heels for the boy.
i really want this to work. 
he means more to me than he knows.

also, one minute i love the babies, and the next i feel like my head is going to explode.
but i definitely love the 1 year olds.
i got to be in Toddler 1s today, and let me tell you, i had fun.
i also got an admirer.
he's 2 and his name is Jack.
he kept grabbing my hand and leading me places when we were outside.
it was adorable.
i also just love all the 1 year olds, so they get a shout out.
Carlos, Harrison, William, Parker, Brianna, Marysol, Mitchell, and Melanie.
i also love Ahmet, Trenton, and Marcus, but they weren't there today.

i want to get a second job, again, so that i have less free time. the extra time is boring me. 
and i'm just as tired as i was when i had two jobs, so i might as well have one and be making monies.

"event","i have my fingers crossed.
it is possible that i will be getting t1.
and when i told eric that, he thought i was still talking about birth control (due to the conversation prior to be bringing this up) and it was so cute.
but seriously. i love my babies more than life. but the 1s do so much more. you get to play more, and it's less of a give bottle, change diaper, put down for a nap thing.
plus eventually all of my babies will be in my room again. and i want a chance to play with the babies who are already there.
there is far too much drama going on within the daycare. and i hear come august we are losing something like 7 of the teachers. crazy. i'm staying.

i want to see the boy.
not sure when i'll get to, but i will eventually and i will be happy and smile.
tonight is liezuh's birthday party so i'll be going to that. it should be fun.

"event","for some reason, my life has a way of not going at all how i planned it.
we'll take tonight for example. i drove home from denver, leaving much earlier than planned, i thought it would be nice to see eric when i got home.
so i asked if he was up for a shower-cuddle buddy sort of visitor. and he said that would be fine.
once there, i ended up showering alone. (suck #1)
when we do finally go to bed, he hardly cuddles and in just over an hour, he decides he can't sleep and gets up. due to this, i cannot seem to get to sleep myself. (suck #2)
after trying for a while, i decide i'll just go home, because at least the drive should make me tired. i tell him, and he seems like he less than cares. (suck #3)
so here i am at home, getting ready to go to bed, much later than i would have had i just come home (i'd have been here around 9:45) and i'm going to sleep ALONE. (suck #4)

maybe...i should just stop trying to do cute things. or spend nights with him. they aren't seeming to work. DO NOT get me wrong. i fucking adore this kid and the time we spend together. it just seems like when i get excited about stuff...it doesn't work out. i don't know what to do. maybe i should just stop trying and let shit happen. but when i try to do that, i find myself wanting to make things happen. and...then i overreact and say/do stupid things i regret hours later. 

ugh...just want a good cuddle with the boy. and a good nights sleep, but those don't seem to go hand in hand. i'll figure this out one of these days."

i dont really have time for it, and the only reason i'm on right now is because i am at eric's house and he isn't.

last weekend...natali graduated college. finally. well it feels like it took forever.
dad and i drove to ohio. we left thursday night...well 12:45 am friday.
mom flew in thursday morning, and got to hang out with natali.
we got in around noon friday, eastern time.
the drive was pretty smooth. dad drove about half.
mom and dad played nice at the reception/bbq.
went to the mall with natali, and picked up ruthie.
saw what jac would look like heavier, and with piercings.  i shuttered. ew.
graduation was lovely. especially when everyone broke out into song.
mom and dad continued to play nice.
i met lots of people.
then we went to olive garden.
watched a bad hilary duff movie with mom and natali.
helped natali pack.
drove home early sunday morning.
was particularly depressed.
went to see eric.
got a b in social psych. score. didnt read the book, or put much effort in til the end.
he left for vegas monday morning.
spent the majority of the week being lazy.
saw jac thursday. we picked up jeff friday.
volunteered at respite during the night.
met the most amazing child of my entire life.,
spencer. he makes life worth living.
no seriously. i wish that everyone could meet him.

(i am not a good table)

wanted jac to like johnny. ehhh.
eric got home friday, so i saw him after.
and hey, it's saturday night.
natali leaves soon, but i'm at eric's/
and it's really hot outside, and devon is crying.
hmmmm.

"event","i have a lot of homework to get done over the next three weeks. school is out april 24th, and i couldn't be more ready. as time has passed, it has gotten harder to get all that i need to finish done. i dont want to do. lately, i want to sleep, or cuddle with eric, or gossip with jac and her momma and sisters. not do homework.
i'm starting to settle for less than i should. i got a 68 on my philosophy test and actually cheered. hey, that's better than my 59 on the previous test. i haven't read the book once in that class, hell i didnt even bother shelling out the cash to have the book. and i'm like, as long as i pass, life is good. i wish i was more interested, but there are more fun things going on.
but i know that by the end of the 4 month break, i'm going to be more than ready to go back to school, i just wish that i had an idea of what i was going to do with my life when i'm done with college. (ps, that was one long run-on sentence)
i need to find a second job. because as much as i love papa john's. i can't work there full time, i'd get far too frustrated. i'm thinking either hot topic, or a daycare job. i took out my septum ring, and my center lip ring, so this could be just a bit easier on the daycare front. i'll apply at ht today, i think. and see what they say. two jobs for the summer is good. and one for when school starts back up in late august.
i don't see enough people. i spend all of my time with the same kids. which i don't mind. but i think my other friends feel neglected. i spend MOST of my time with eric. several nights a week. but i really do enjoy all of the time spent with him. then next is probably jac. i spent most of last weekend with her. then it's a tie between sam and fish. the four greatest friends i could ask for. but i would like to see whitney more. and liz. i'll work this out when it's summer. right now my time is already spread so thin. 
i wish i had easter plans. sam is in cali. fish has viktor and his second easter. jac probably has family stuff. and eric has family stuff. where am i in this mess? my family sucks at easter, though they haven't always. 
i want to bake sugar cookies with cute cookie cutters. who wants to join?

....
Roxanne's birthday is next week. i wish i could do something nice for her. she thinks that i think she only uses me. but i dont. i just get easily frustrated and talk out my ass. i should take her cookies or something.

i do wish things could be different and that this could work out, but oh well. i have good friends to help me keep my life together while i prepare to move back in with my mom. i have jac, who is the sweetest thing in life. and i have caitlin, eric and baby fish, who make me smile constantly; everyone needs a one year old to brighten their day. i have eric, who is probably the most amazing boy i've ever known and i'm lucky he likes to be around me. i will soon have sam. and that's my amazing entourage that keeps my life together.

overland park is going to suck. and so many things will change. i won't get to drive 5 minutes when i want to see jac, i'll have to drive 30. when i want to see michelle, it'll be 30, not 15. when i want to see fish, i wont get to just hop on 291, ill have to take 35. i wont have internet access at my house anymore. eric won't be a 15 minutes zip down 350 anymore. oh well.

i've got a car, so ill still see everyone i want to. ill just be spending more money on gas. but that's something ill get use to. and ill still technically save money because i won't be paying rent, or buying a shit ton of groceries i never eat.

 i am the only person i know, save for two boys whom i am not particularly great friends with, nor do i happen to see often, and one amazing boy named jesse, that happens to be a virgin.

that's right. i haven't had sex.
oh well.

i didn't know this friend had, so it was an eye opening little chat. and it was nice being able to talk to someone about the awkwardness and general uglyness of penis' and how i dont like them. and could live without them probably.
and also, we talked about how i can't/won't have sex because i'm not comfortable with my body. but she said it helped her to be more comfortable. which is what i hear. but hey, that doesn't mean i'm going to slut it up. i want a boyfriend, a relationship. but maybe it makes me just a little bit less scared about losing something that should be more important to me than it currently is.

not great, honestly.
1. i've failed miserably and almost ruined of my best friendships...sorry michelle. i suck.
2. i'm more or less rocking this one. although i had dessert pizza twice. but none of that eating leftover pizza because im bored, go me!
3. well i've shaved once, but my leg hair is growing back so slowly...that i suppose its okay.
4. nope...still once every 3-4 days.
5. sure, i suppose.
6. i made four at the FOB show in stl.
7. 3 lbs. yay!
8. yep, i guess. i did 850 crunches today!
9. uhm...no.
10. i did just buy some dvds, but none on that list. the jackass box set, care bears 2, and bang bang you're dead. oh and the steve-o dvd for red.
11. nope.
12. i've had two days of class...it was cancelled this week...but ive done....most of my homework.
13. decided against in...maybe in a few weeks. i like the lack of everything.
14. no and no on 15.

so i've spent the last few days watching everyone on the jackass number two dvd. over and over and over again. i haven't had class since thursday, because of the weather, and because i only have class two days a week. so i've spent my days lounging, and excercising, and watching it.

i have these favorite parts i watch repeatedly.
.bam's reaction to getting his toes shocked 'don't do it'.
.bam saying 'fuck this' after seeing the riot control test.
.ryan shaking as he pulls his shirt up after the riot control.
.ryan's cute butt when he get's shocked.
.ryan's reaction to getting shocked.... 'no'.
.ryan's reaction to stun gunning his balls.
.bam, in general, on the vma shock phone thing.
.the flying 69, in all its glory.
.the riot control test, in general.
.bam crying because of the snake.
.medicine ball dodgeball in the dark.
.ryan saying 'it's a mushroom joke'.
.loomis fall.

yep, i watch that stuff pretty constantly. in between studying. right before i go to sleep. when i wake up. before i leave the house. i'm a nerd but i really love it. and i can't wait til summer. red and i have plans to search for ryan and steve-o, maybe even for bam. just because i honestly think ryan seems like a totally chill dude. and red really wants to bang steve-o and try out for playboy. 

oh and i'm totally obsessed with bridget from the girls next door. i think she's the cutest girl ever in the whole entire world and i want to be her friend. or something. i think i have a girl crush on her. it's so weird though...because she's in her 30s, but hey, she thinks nothing of age differences. she's dating hugh hefner. she has to be pretty comfortable with it, and other girls, by now. ugh, i love her. i want to hang out with her. as my sister said, i should write to her and as if we can have a 'play-date'. wouldn't that be cute? me and bridget hanging out. yay!

the fall out boy show last week was beyong amazing. one hundred times more intense than i expected. i'm so glad roxanne semi talked me into buying the tickets. i mean i wanted to, but she pushed me over the edge into actually doing it. and wow. early november, new found glory, fall out boy. all amazing sets. especially from second row, on the left side. glorious. thank you michelle and roxanne for that amazing trip. and thank you jasmine, melissa, jesse, and koy for making it fun while we were there."

8. excercise more (i was doing so well then i just got lazy)
9. see movies im interested in
10. buy dvds that i like (and i included a possible list?)
.girls next door. (is this even a dvd?)
.degrassi: tng.
.viva la bam. (gotta get that off my computer)
.homewreckers. (not even ON dvd)
11. journal often (i was doing so well, then i got bored, or i got a life, not sure)
12. do better in school (> 3.5 (not good enough for me) my semester was a 3.66))
13. get another job (hot topic?)
14. find a decent boy (that's just a wish)
15. be less of a whore, or more (hahahahahahaha)


it's a lot to accomplish, but hey i can do it....maybe.
my school schedule for this semester puts me in classes from 8-3:15 on tuesdays and thursdays. i'll be working on friday nights, saturday days, and sunday nights. im hoping to find a job that will have me working on mondays, wednesdays, friday days, and sunday days. so i'll have lots of money and absolutely no free time. if i could get a job at hot topic, i wouldn't even have to keep it for that long. just long enough to get the clothes i want. hello %40 discount. i hope they hire me.

uhm...hmm. sam is in town, and i love her. eric leaves tomorrow, which is sad.
i hung out with him, fish and the baby yesterday. still my favorite family. i need pictures. 

i hate my living situation. pat keeps saying i should move in with him. (im not sure if he's serious) but ive got cat allergies and he has two kitties. sucks."

"event","im not really sure where my life is going these days.  im moving back in with my mom which sucks right now. because there are four of us in a two bedroom apt and the room that was mine, went to my sister, and the other half is full of boxes. my uncle gets the couch and i share my mom's bed with her.

i go to sleep late, between three and four, anymore, and get up between 9 and noon. but that's just because of winter break. i haven't accomplished anything worthwhile recently.

this passed weekend, i spent a lot of time baking cookies for christmas presents.
and flirting with adam, a manager at nall papa john's.
weird. that isn't really going anywhere because he doesn't call me. but when i do see him he says things like when we watch this movie, so im confused. and concerned that i may not actually be interested in him.

therefore, i dont really like anyone. which im pretty okay with.

been spending a lot of time with my sister. which is great, because i am really good at making her laugh. and that's one thing she definitely hasn't had enough of in her life.

her birthday is saturday, and i dont think she's going to enjoy it at all.

tonight, was steph's going away party and she threw up on herself...multiple times.

i think, i love jackass. that was the only good present i got, thanks to red. i got money from mom, but it's sad when your mom doesnt buy you anything because she doesnt know what you want/like anymore.

monsters, inc is on, and pat is asleep. im going to leave as soon as it's over."

"event","so, life.

i really did give up on the boy.
and it was liberating, as was the decision to not go over to his (and ross') house all the time. which is a big change because i was literally spending most of my time there.

i spend most of my time listening to hanson, the backstreet boys, senses fail, and loafing on my mom's couch watching bad tv. i've grown to love the girls next door.

my sister just left virginia about an hour ago.
she'll be home sometime tomorrow.
her christmas present...smaller boobs.
and the family couldn't be happier.

saw senses fail last week.
they were good...until that one song.
buddy fucked up and hailey and i giggled almost to tears. and couldnt believe him.
oh but i am the avalanche played first. and as always, they were amazing. i love them.
talked to them after the show. and vinnie was his sweet self. we talked about me scratching him, seems we always will. he said i made a 'lasting impression' on him. he's so cute and sweet. and yep. his band is amazing.

im so glad that hailey went with me. i think we only had that much fun because it was just the two of us, and we haven't been to a show together in...over a year.
senses fail was too cool for school and we didnt get to talk to them. fuckers.

the weather is shitty.
im on my period. and yesterday, i wanted to die.
lately ive been having jaw pains on the right side...and my belly piercing is infected, so i went to the doctor.
hooray, i have TMJ. not exciting. painful. im not allowed to chew gum, or take big bites of things. no more chipotle. i did get some muscle relaxers.
after the appointment, i spent the next three hours in a great deal of pain. the worst headache of my life, and the worst cramps. i curled up and wanted to cry, but decided to scream instead.
i'll be cool.
uhm. one final left.

the one i life. math. hooray!!!!!
uhhh....winter break, yay!"

my septum hurts less and less.


i just finished my spanish test in less than 15 minutes.
and i studied all of...10 minutes i suppose.


i have the second highest grade in my math class, of 32 students, and i dont think i put any effort into it.
i have 190 of 200 points in my criminal justice class, and i definitely put nothing into it.
im sure i have a B in my speech class, and same with photography, probably spanish as well.


i dont care about school this semester.
i could be doing so much better? i think.
maybe not.

the boy situation is dumb.
i want to find me a real boy.
a boyfriend.
not someone that i cuddle with when it's just the two of us.
not someone that touches me in cute ways one day, and then ignores me the next.
definitely not an alcoholic.

but my new thing i want in a boy is...
a boy that will get pedicures with me.
life isnt interesting unless you're having fun doing everything.

yesterday, i played with a cute dog, and helped out a homeless friend.

i want to bake cookies.
all the fucking time.

and i want to make out, with no attachments.

i miss reading fanfics all the time, but my internet is no more.
i have to be out of my house in just over a month, and i dont know what im going to do. 
but i honestly love that fact.

not being sure is so exciting. 
and so much more intersting."

i was completely ready to give up on this boy.
and tried to make it so i wasnt allowed at his house.

by throwing stuff out the cabinet.
but dani wanted me over, so i apologized to ross (his roomie) and went over.

cookies were baked with my general manager from work.
beer pong was played.
and around 4...i decided to watch tank girl.

boy joined me, and flirt-ily touched me.
(even though he mostly ignored me...and has been)

around 530 i woke him up and made him sleep in his bed.
i was going to sleep in the extra bed.
but boy kept saying that was 'no fun'
and knocked me into his bed.

i had on a mini skirt and skimpy panties.
one might say i wanted action.

somehow we started to kiss.
and i talked about my skimpy underwear.
and he decided he wanted to 'investigate' or something.
which led to boy touching the girl parts.
and hahah. and boy mouths.
and/...
experience.

and him saying 'i want to be inside you' and me saying no.
and him being okay with that.
and more kissing.
and me starting to shake for some reason.

and him saying 'so i guess asking for a blow job is out of the question'

and...still havent seen his penis. 
but he attempted to get me to give him a handjob.
but i was still shaking.
so we just ended up sleeping.

and then i found my panties this morning.


life is strange.

"event","so i like this boy.
a lot.
but he's an alcoholic.
and kind of an asshole. (his words)
and im not sure what to do.

this is the third night in a row ive slept at his house.
but tonight was different.
he told me i wasn't allowed to sleep in his bed.

yuck.
ive been keeping him up late.
first night talking to him, and last night, kissing him.
and then today i woke him up early and wanted to kiss him.

and this is the confusing part, that's written to him even though he doesnt livejournal, but it sums me up:<strike>

im sorry, i cant help it that im super affectionate at all hours.
i dont need sleep to function.
and you're an alcoholic.
but i still like you.
and you told me that you liked me, you really liked me.

but we also both realize that a relationship probably wouldn't work out.
you remind me of my father, and i hate that.
and you fucking got mad at me, and dragged me out of your kitchen for cleaning it.
that, i dont understand. most boys would be greatful that their....not even girlfriend, just the girl they liked, wanted to help clean their house.
you gotta get over it.
im helpful, and sweet, and nice....some days.
//
its who i am.
im also, like i said, super affectionate. and i want to kiss you until im sleepy.
and i want to wake up, and look at you when you're asleep.
and i want to kiss you until you wake up.
and i dont care if you have bad breath, because i like to kiss you.

i want to sleep in your bed so i can be near you. and cuddle.\/hold/kiss you whenever i feel the need.

im sorry that i dont have sex.
and im sorry that's super frustrating for you.
but i like you. and i want you to be mine.
i have been over at your house so many days in the past month because i like being around you.
and i hope we'll have awesome conversations. (which we do)
and i hope that we'll kiss occasionally, which we do.

i can hear you moving around upstairs right now, and i have been able to all night.
i really hope you're okay.
last time i saw you tonight, you said you were drunk.
true.
but maybe, i think i can handle it.
even if you dont believe it.
its my call if i can.

its your call of whether or not you're willing to let me try.
this situation has to be figured out soon.
because i refuse to wait forever.</strike> 
:::(edit at 11pm on 11/24)
that was a lie.
im done.
done.
done.
im better than this.
i dont need to be ignored.
i dont need an alcoholic.
i just dont care.
i can find a cuter boy.
i can find a nicer boy.
i can find a boy who isnt lying when he says he likes me.
im done. fo' serious this time.
but hell, if we make out. it happens. but im not trying to persue a relationship anymore.
his friends just keep telling me bad things.
and it makes me NOT interested. im done!::::



////////
and yep, that was long and pointless and i hope that he can magically read it.
maybe ill leave him a cute little link to it. or text him a web address.
either way, i feel just a little bit better getting it off my chest.

sorry i havent been updating.

ive been living life.
not an exciting one.
but its what i got.
love me.
accept me.
read me.
comment yo.

i feel bad about that, cuz i love her.
i did all my cookie dishes, and those left in the sink.
i hope my roomies appreciate it.
then i went to eat with cait and eric. 
well they ate.
i hung out with them.
but before, i counted ALL the money i could find in my room...
that totaled 593.
then counting car monies. and piggy bank monies.
i ended with 704.
that's counting all my random stashes.

i want to quit my job so badly i can't even stand it. i think i'm only staying there for the guy i like, and that's stupid. oh, and i need money. 
people are changing, and i'm not quite sure when it started, but they are different. but i seem to stay the same. always.
i would really like to finish moving downstairs, if i could get any help from the other people in my house. no one wants to assist, and it pisses me off. 
i went shopping yesterday and spent $100 in like an hour. don't know how that happened, but i probably shouldn't have done that. everything was on sale, that's what i just keep telling myself. 
i feel like i need to puke. gross."

no school tomorrow...or the next day. 
normally, i would be excited. however, that means we have to use our snow days to make up these days we are missing. 
it doesn't even make a difference if we cancel school tomorrow and tuesday to save gas. unless the rest of the country cancelled school as well, it doesn't matter. 
sure, we might save 500,000 gallons of diesel fuel. doesn't matter because there will still be 500,000 x 49 gallons still being used in other states by those buses.

i like Psychology, English, Design, and maybe Econ...but Stat sucks....not as a subject...but as a class. i have the most annoying people of life in there. i don't really like to talk about it.
ms. ashley McCarty is in 2 of my classes this year. YAY. and i take her home from school now. i love it. we went and got sushi today. yummy. two days of sushi in a row now. life is good. 
i take jonathon to school now. that's pretty cool. someone to talk to in the morning. kinda sucks though cuz i can't blair my music like i always do. oh well, just won't get that morning pick-me-up. that's ok. 
i have german 4. hardest thing ever. didn't even want the class. i wanted anatomy, but freakin mrs. patterson, last year, didn't sign me up for the class. biotch. so then i got put on a waiting list, and signed up for german 4 for the time being. well, i didn't get anatomy, and now i'm stuck in german 4. it is awful. i feel soo dumb. i think i'm gonna get transferred to directed studies, like i want, though. fingers crossed.

it sounds like my grandma is in pretty bad shape, and my mom didn't want me to see her like that.
my grandma is like a cockroach: she cannot die (knock on wood). she has survived through 4 kids, smoking for 60 years, and anurism, breast cancer, emphysema, and now bashing in her face by falling. 
she is the woman with perhaps the most pride of any person i have ever met. yet, she is also one of the funniest people with the funniest outlook on life. i just love her so much.
she refuses to leave her house and come live near or with us, but yet she cannot do things by herself when something major happens. she has to wear an oxygen tube all the time, and one night the power went out, so the oxygen generator went out too. thank god my aunt was there with her, or she would not have made it. things like that scare me. i don't know what i would do if i lost her. she is just amazing.

"event","well, the weekend in Gatlinburg was a success: i know now that each member of an entire family can have a mullet; men, women, grandparents, children, teenagers, and even babies. oh yes, there were babies with mullets. i must say, though, that this weekend made me come to realize how humorous the south really is. not all of the south, just the redneck population. i mean, the things and accomodations they think are ""nice"" (i.e. the holiday inn) seems rather run down and common in my perspective. although, i guess they do save a bunch of money on vacations, probably because they have too. ""come on kids! let's have aunt sally trim our mullets and let's head to pigeon forge."" other people go to the beach. but not rednecks. i would go so far as to say that Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge, Tennessee is the Las Vegas for rednecks. no joke. it is that commercial and crowded. it seriously looks like a popular beach, such as Panama City or Daytona, just without the beach, and with many more rednecks. 
and just why, might you ask, was i in this redneck-infested area? well, i was there with my family, of course, visiting my grandparents who just HAD to attend this convention or something with the company that my grandmother supposedly retired from, the credit union. well, those credit bastards make these poor retirees go to this place every year, for some strange reason. i haven't the slightest guess why. maybe because the mountains and such are really beautiful, and they really are. that was the good thing about the trip: going up in the mountains, and the ripley's aquarium was cool too. 
i had been to gatlinburg once before. when i was really young, probably 4 or 5, i went to galinburg to dance in this competition. i don't recall it being that crowded then, but then again, i was 4, so i don't really remember that well. funny thing is, the only thing i do remember from that trip was my brother almost getting killed on a go-kart. kind of terrible that that is the only thing i remember, i know. 


so, my advice to anyone who wants to go to the smoky mountains: stay in a chalet, on a mountain, and stay there. if you must leave, go to ober gatlinburg, because it is not as congested as down in town. and never, under any circumstances, go to pigeon forge."

"event","i feel torn. my next door neighbors that i strongly believe are drug dealers/ pimps have a little puppy, but i don't really know what kind. just can't figure out what kind of dog it is. anyway, they keep this dog tied up outside with nothing but a shoe lace around its neck all day long. in the scolding hot sun. it has been out there during storms with pouring down rain and lightning, which, needless to say, is not good for the dog. the poor thing can't reach its food because it keeps getting wrapped around a tree, even though i think they only feed it once a day anyway. she can't get to her water unless it is topped off, and that's only if she isn't wrapped around the tree. she is the sweetest dog, but if she stays in those conditions for much longer, she is going to get really really mean, which i think is what the owners are actually trying to do. 
i am seriously considering stealing the dog and taking it to someone that would want it. anyone would do. i would keep her myself if i didn't live right next door to the people i am about to steal from. that might be obvious. i just want her to be ok. i feel so sad for her, and she looks so miserable. 
so, if you or anyone you know is looking for a dog, let me know. and trust me, they would never come looking for it. i plan on making it look like she just got loose. it will work. it has to."

"event","well, i went to Florida this weekend. thank goodness i finally have some pigment in my skin. i was basically pasty pale from not going to the pool yet this summer. but now i look like one of the living. 
Nick got home on thursday. he is as much an a-hole as he ever was. maybe he just needs someone to yell at him to take him back to Field training mode. i will gladly be that person. 
4th of July is coming up. Dad is setting off fireworks like usual in norcross and woodstock. everyone has someone to take besides me. i just want someone to watch fireworks with. is that so much to ask?
i miss my exchange student and her family so much. i think i might go back to germnay next summer for a little while. but now, my whole family is talking about having a reunion on a Disney cruise next summer. wooo hoo. that should be fun since i can't really stand to be around my entire family for more than a couple of days. great. 

anybody who's feeling a little bored, kinda like me, we should chill. if i'm not babysitting at the moment.

"event","well, i got back to Atlanta yesterday. i miss my exchange family so much, but i am so glad to be home. it is great seeing my family again. i went to bed at nine last ngiht...after being awake for like 40 hours straight or something. we all went to this foam party saturday night, which was kinda lame and disgusting, but i definitely should have stayed home and packed and slept instead. oh well. i got to sleep for 15 hours last night. it was amazing. oh, my mom totally got me tickets to BSB. i almost peed myself when i saw them. 
me and my mom went to see The Perfect Man tonight. man i hate hilary duff...she needs to get some writers over like the age of twelve...she has the worst one-liners ever. but the movie was pretty good. and roxanne from american dreams was in it...man i love that show. 
well, i start working tomorrow, babysitting 4 days a week for like an 11 and 13 year old...what a sweet job, and i get $200 bucks a week...AWESOME. and then this weekend i am going to florida with the whole fam since nick gets back on thursday. i need the beach...i am pretty much the palest kid i know right now...its gross. 
i hope everyone is having a great summer so far. its great to be back in good ol' L'ville.

"event","so, i got to Biberach on Thursday. my exchange family is very nice, but i just wish that i could understand everything they were saying, and not just some things. but i can carry on a conversation with them, which is awesome. yay for taking german 3!!
so the beer here is pretty much disgusting, but they do have this stuff called Radler, which is beer with lemon, and that is quite tasty. but its not like i'm getting drunk every night or anything, so don't get the wrong idea. 
i miss everyone at home sooo much, especially my mom and dad. yesterday was my dad's birthday, and when i called him he and my mom were in florida. i wish i could be with them, but i do love it here. i just wish i could see them like tomorrow and then i would be fine until Sunday when i get home. we are going paddeling down the danube in like an hour, so that should be fun. and then on thursday, we are going to castle neuschwanstein, and i am soooo stoked. it is the cinderella castle. YAY!!!
anywho, i gotsta be going so i can play some pool. much love!!

"event","so tonight has pretty much been the worst night of my life. 
it started out well enough, since i didn't go to practice and everything.but that was early on.
so i kinda sorta had plans of going to a play with someone... but those didn't work out. don't worry, i don't blame you... you had other things to do. fine, whatever.
so then i fell asleep, ended up not going to the play because i feel like total and complete shit, but then i decided to go to Frontera with my parents and ms. amy, who by the way never shuts up. i didn't feel much like talking to her because my throat is on fire, but she didn't seem to get that.
our waitor sucked, and we were there way too long. 
then as we were walking back to the car, my dad decides to inform me that i'm fat (or as he would put, i'm getting a little pudgy). thanks dad, i think i'll go slit my wrists now after i become anorexic. i cried the whole way home, but mom doesn't know. and by the way, he has no right to tell any other person that they are fat...he's not exactly trim himself. ass. and my throat is still on fire.
so, sorry ashley for not coming to your play, perhaps i'll make it tomorrow."

"event","so this morning has been pretty much the most amazing morning i have had in a while.
i ot to sleep til 7:30, which doesn't sound that late, but it is when you normlly have to wake up at 5:30. i would have slept later but i had to do my outline for lang. arts. then, me and my mom went to           chick-fil-A, and then i checked in at 10:40. 
so, actually, the morning doesn't sound that amzing, but it was good becasue i never get to do that. i'm so sick of the same routine every morning. it pisses me off so bad to do the same thing every day. i just wish i could switch things up every so often, even if just for a day.
my brother's military awards was ok. he didn't win anything, but the food was good.

well, i'm really stressed out lately with school and everything.  i found out the other day that i probably won't get HOPE. that sucks big, unless i pull my grades up like crazy bad in the next few weeks, then i will have no hope of getting it. and, i'm still failing physics. that whore really doesn't want me to pass. its like she does everything she can to not let me pass. maybe i should try to be nicer to her. idk. 
i went to the library yesterday, and there were an insane amount of Sophomores there. is that like the new thing to do? i never would have thought to hang out at the library, i thought that was where you were supposed to do work or something, maybe i'm just crazy.
i really have trouble focusing nowadays. maybe i'm ADD, or maybe i just can't stop thinking of something else...

"event","I see the world in 80-HD: Advanced multiplicity. I adhere to elasticity, abhor inconsistency, and cling to fragility. I manufacture stimuli visually and send it to the ""o-factory"" for processing unknown. I do not rely on packaging of individuality no matter the gauge of futility. I have a certain voracity in my pursuit of clarity, of which I am fully aware. My blood runs deeper than my capillaries, with unprecedented viscosity, to give Fortinbras a run for his money. In other words, through these eyes I see an under-used, overwhelming potential for poetry."

"event","I've recently been impaled by a chute of inspiration, so allow me to make this brief declaration in which the complication and mindless societal masturbation will be addressed, redressed, transgressed and progressed to the point of fact calling us to act based on something more than emotion, near to devotion and far from explosion. This is a call to action, not some simple faction inquiring, inspiring or conspiring reaction from the masses, upper, lower and middle classes doing just enough to save our sorry asses. Rather. This is life wherein lie lies and cries for something more than the bullshit we manufacture and is less than satisfactory. Jump up on your feet and fall to the street where you may meet some one who has never known sweet. Walk in those shoes and you'll find that you lose nothing more than the carelessness heartlessness and unfairness that we project in this project we claim is still sane while somewhere close no one knows how long their shoes will last to warm their toes. And, in conclusion this seclusion and scarce illusion incurs an allusion to you and yours when all the wherefores and therefores become cast in glass just waiting to shatter until some one discovers that they really matter. That they matter too. And here's the hook you will find in no book that has been so overlooked, that inspired young Bowie to inquire ""Is there life on Mars?"" In this time of unrest I have but one request for an answer. ""Is there life?"""

My consciousness shattered

You danced around the room
My head was filled with fumes
And I passed on.

Soft hands, blue eyes
Smooth lips
I've been told there are
Knights and princesses
Magical whirlwinds
That sparkle, shimmer and shine.

The one with shaved legs
Shaped eyebrows
And red, red
Cheeks.

A polished wardrobe 
In which to hang your ties

It's difficult to say

Brought up with a good foundation

Always on edge.

For you?

Shooting through abandoned petals
Of 'He-loves-me-nots'
The serial number on your back
Will never code for the reflection
In the sink. 
And so you're in the sink
In sync wherein lies internal tissues.
Marred by loves 
You sent away.
Dead men tell no tales
Live mannequins sell no cause.
I've been cornered and stoned
By the levity you bring.
And these arms, these hands,
Can't even lift a pen.

And the wafting scent fades.

Like an echo.

We dance around the real problem

Lonliness only sets in when the greatest act of revenge occurs
And that is leading a good life
Voidless and fulfilled.

With the twinkle in her eye
But she's found her endeavor
And your invitation was lost in the mail.
And you will sit and you will scream
You'll discredit my existence
To return to me half your height
And drag me down with you.
You're beautiful. But you define beauty differently.
Right and wrong never apply
When self-doubt is on the line.
I missed you so much.
All this time nothing would have pleased me more
Than to say to you
'Welcome home.'
You remain far away, though I can touch your cheek
And trace your brow.
I map out your best features gingerly
Because you'd never pull away,
Though my fingers may be cold.
And the bruises you left behind 
Are painted on the walls now
My baby's gone, my baby's gone
But baby smiles on, baby lives without you
And baby never looks back.
And oh God, oh God!
How it hurts, and pains you so.

"event","When Rochester awoke the next day promptly at 6:07 in the a.m., he made no effort in fooling himself. He did not pinch himself in the arm, nor examine his hands, nor check his backside to see if he'd grown a tail. He was fully aware that he was not living in a dream. Perhaps this is because Mr. T. Hammel rarely, if ever, remembered his dreams, and if he had, he surely couldn't remember them now. Dreaming was a long coveted experience for him, but he was never able to achieve it, it seemed.
He rose from the couch somewhat lethargically, a series of cracks and pops echoing about his body. He ambled over to the kitchen, and tore the note from the corkboard. ""Went to find Joe. --Kerry"" Rochester scoffed. His wife always did have a way with words. And there was no doubt where she had gone, either. ""Joe"" was just a name she'd coined in searching for her ""soulmate."" It had been borne from her infatuation since girlhood with Joe Dimaggio. Rochester had never really understood, and for some reason, that always placed a minor barrier between himself and his wife. 
""Joe."" Rochester said the name aloud. Suddenly, the poor man was inspired to tears, though no liquid trickled from his eyes. He leaned his back against the wall and slid down slowly, until he rest on the floor, head in his hands. For a number of moments he sat there, contemplating nothing, the very thing which with he was left. 
Within time he tromped up the staircase and into the bathroom, dousing his face and hair with cool water. He brushed his teeth, gargled, spit, and exited the bathroom. Into the bedroom he wandered, aimlessly. It was now he noticed the brown nightstand. Something was out of place - no - not there at all.
The nightstand was a peculiar little piece; simple, and yet intricate at moments. It was tall, with long, shapely legs, and trimmed with an ordinary pattern, more than common to the time. It contained two ordinary drawers, one right atop the other, the higher one half the depth as the lower. At least, that was how it normally appeared. For now, the bottom drawer was gone, and the little nightstand was left with a great void within it's belly.
Oh, the treasures that drawer had seen. ""Hmph. Treasures indeed..."" remarked Rochester at this thought. The bottom drawer of the nightstand had held letters and little trinkets, the occasional necklace or ring, old photographs and receipts, but it had a hidden compartment. And within that little nook were pills of all sizes and colors, a lighter and emergency pack of Victoria Slims. Small plastic cases and cloth pouches filled with little addictions. Treasures, indeed.
Rochester had known about his wife's problem for three of the four years of their marriage. He'd discovered the compartment in the bottom of the drawer only seven months past. When he did, he was enfuriated, but did not express this to Kerry, for fear that she would leave him. It seemed now, that it made no difference, as she had done just that. But had she really been in such a hurry as to take the drawer in it's entierty? Ah no. It was then that Rochester took note of the splintered wood scraps strewn about the carpet. All this realized, and all Rochester could bring himself to do, was go down to the kitchen, and pray she'd not taken the coffee.


So here's section 2. Leave a comment if you like, I'd be interested to hear what you think. I was really really sick last night. Vomited for 9 hours straight. I missed play practice. KBH is none too happy. Oh well. Bed time."

The sinister faces seeing him off into the night were no help in coping with his current situation. Whence he had finally claimed a cab and made his way home, he stepped up the walkway toward his green door. Having tripped on a step, his mood was by no means on the upturn, but nothing prepared him for what he saw upon entering his house. At first, it was as he had left it 3 days ealier, or so he thought, as it was very dark and nothing could be seen. He even thought it just his poor luck when he tried to set his keys on the coffee table but heard them drop to the floor instead. He didn't notice that he didn't kick or trip over a number of toys that were usually strewn about the house. Unlike other nights, he held no interest in sitting on the couch in the den and checking the news for the day, as he did nearly every other night. Instead, Rochester felt his way to the stairs, and walked up them slowly, in the dark, his joints creaking as loudly as the ancient steps he climbed.

Hammel, in his thirty-sixth year, went into his room and loosened his tie from his neck, and, in going to sit on his queen sized bed, discovered it was no longer in its proper place. Quickly, he flicked the switch near the door on, and revealed a nearly empty room. Two naked pillows lay on the floor where the carpet grew lighter in hue where the bed once stood. There were some unpaired and soiled socks, gum rappers, and the awkward little brown nightstand near the corner. However, there was no wife sleeping, no chest of drawers, and the closet was dreadfully empty.
Rochester dropped the lavender tied he'd been clutching in his hand. Resolutely, he tromped down the staircase and turned the light on for the living area. No couch, no coffee table, no Lay-Z-Boy. Just a short loveseat and his keys laying haphazardly on the floor. Pinned to the corked bulletin board in the kitchen was a college ruled, lined sheet of paper with five haunting words scribbled across it: ""Went to find Joe. --Kerry""
Mr. Hammel cringed. That night, though disinclined to sleep at all, sleep did come to him on the short loveseat. He'd sing himself into oblivion.



So this is the first installment of a story. Hope you kind of like it. There will be more to it, but it's not going to be horribly long, so no worries. Uhm. I got my laptop back (FINALLY!!!) but my hardrive got erased...bummer. Anyway, I renamed my computer Rochester T. Hammel. Sound familiar? I just like the name and it seems to fit well for the story. Sometimes I kick my own ass, I'm so cool. Anyway...some boys want to date me. Not sure how I feel about that. Complications galore! I'm not concerned. So....good nite."

I hung with David Wood and met some other Laramie boys at the Wal-Mart who wanted in my pants. Clever. It's supposed to be 45 minutes from Laramie back to Cheyenne but at a decent speed of 120mph Miss Tracy and I made it back in 26 minutes. Mhmm...And well.

Stare out the window of the city transit bus
Which is more like a Suburban
That you swear was made in the dark ages.
Rock back and forth with the seats
A perpetual movement
As the earth sighs beneath the wheels.
Search the faces of the crowd
Their blurred expressions rushing by.
Pray to make eye contact with just one persyn
To share a moment with some one
Some thing, to share a brief
Bittersweet breath
As the bustling crowds bumble by.
Three more blocks disappear behind you.
This is your stop.
This is your fate.
To deny that fact is to deny yourself.
Well, you lost yourself long ago.
As you tread down the steps
A vibration strikes your hip urgently.
You reach into the pocket of your tweed overcoat
Pull out the phone. See the familiar letters on the screen.
Say hello. Ask, ""How are you?"" Say you're fine.
Lie about eating lunch. Lie some more.
About how you didn't quit smoking,
As you pull a slender cyllinder from a box and light it.
Lie about work, so close to that raise,
Hadn't you quit a week earlier.
Make plans to ""Hang out sometime and catch up.""
With little intention of keeping them.
Few plans are worth keeping.
Flip the phone closed and replace it in your pocket.
Inhale deeply and watch the tip glow bright red.
Decidedly enter a shop and purchase a simple pocketwatch.
Suck the last of the cancer from your filtered addiction
And toss it away familiarly.
Look up from the ashes and see a fire much brighter.
Two eyes burning with intrigue, caught just before collision.
Apologize. Laugh nervously. Apologize again.
Reach for the dropped pocketbook.
Revel in the awkward moment when they do the same.
Pull away and brush the hair from your brow.
Feel the searing pink envelope your cheeks, and watch beauty walk away.
Take in the fresh scent lingering in the air.
Cover it with a burning tube between your lips. 
Walk behind the horizon.
Paint a polaroid picture of what never was,
But always should have been.
Smile and inhale, as the whitewash covers everything.

"event","Well, My mom came and picked me up Monday night and took me to the hospital in Casper. I was horribly dehydrated because my tonsils were swollen to the point where I could hardly breathe, much less swallow. They spent upwards of 45 minutes trying to get an IV in me, as all my veins were severely deflated or collapsed. I got stabbed with a needle 6 times before they got one, even after digging around with the needle already in my arm. They had to use a needle so small it was their standard for infants. Anyway, they got me hooked up to an IV, took a bunch of blood, gave me some Morphine for the pain, and then did a cat-scan on my neck and nasal passage. My nasal passage was completely blocked by mucous - caused by some sort of severe sinus infection, and my tonsils were swollen to the point that they were touching and constricted my airway to the size of a pen tip. So they admitted me, debated taking me to ICU and intubating my throat if the steriods recently injected in me didn't take the swelling down within 10 minutes. The following two days was sort of a blur. Anyway, the decisive evidence after-the-fact is that I have some strange strain of Mono (strange because all three times that I've been tested for it, I've tested negative) a bad sinus infection, and a micoplasma pneumonia agent somewhere in my chest. I was released from the hospital after appx. 40 hours' stay on Wednesday, December 21.

Aaand, that's the 4-1-1 on how I actually, no exaggerations, almost died. It seems like a foreign idea. I didn't feel like I was dying. I felt like death sounded better than the severe pain at the time, but I didn't feel as though I was ""slipping away."" The doctor's worried looks and my mother's teared eyes said otherwise, of course, but whatever. Anyway, the following is a little melo-drama about my first day back from the hospital. Enjoy, or don't. And parts of it may seem...well, crude, for lack of a better word, but if they do, they're probably just me being cynical and humorous. I know it's a weird story, but I've a strange liking for it. Anyway, off to bed and whatnot with me. Goodbye.

""It's my first day home from the hospital. Not only am I now able to breathe period, I seem to be able 
to inhale through my nose, something I've almost forgotten how to do. With this comes the ability to 
taste and smell...nothing I can say that I've terribly missed - mostly just because it's not something 
I've really been thinking about. I go into the bathroom to take a shower - wash the hospital off of 
me. I'm standing naked in front of a half-length mirror now. ""Not bad,"" I'm thinking to myself. I have
to wonder if something is terribly wrong with me for doing so, since I'm mostly admiring the weight I've
shed from being sick - but maybe I'm just looking at the bright side? It's more than that though. My
skin is mostly clear - especially pallid of course - but clear and smooth-looking. My breasts seem to be
mocking me with their perkyness. They seem to say, ""Cheer up, dollie. You've not worn a bra in over a 
week and we're still holding our heads up."" I climb under the flow of water. I've been in and out of hospitals for a week now and haven't had the ability for a number of reasons to take a proper shower and the first thing I think to do is shave my legs. Am I vain? No, I don't think it's that, even if that is an 
irrelevant fact. I can't seem to explain anything, even myself, anymore. I run shampoo through my wirey
hair, and pull about a third of it completely out effortlessly. That's ok. I've been losing a lot of
hair lately. When I'm finished, though the water seemed chilled on my flesh, all 3 mirrors and the windows
have a thick fog on them, almost as if to spite me. My skin feels raw - nothing a little lotion won't
fix I'm sure. I've come to 3 conclusive announcements on my life. 1. I'm sick and tired of being sick
and tired. 2. I'm so lonely here. 3. I've forgotten everything that ever meant something real.""

Something deep
Something profound
But the phlegm in the back of my throat
Is rather restricting
So I hope that you won't mind
If what this poem is depicting
Is something rather sickening
Because frankly, it sickens me too.

I'd like to discuss some worldly issues
Over coffee or some tea
But I find that lately everything
Seems much more tedious than it should be
Current events are so yesterday
Like the hair of the guy down my street
With the obnoxious T-Shirt
Which says things I'll not repeat.
For they're are not very sweet.
They even give my poor dog cold feet.

Perhaps I should write about love
Oh, but it's ever-so-taboo
Or perhaps I'm just hiding the fact
That I haven't got a clue
None of that shit makes sense.
I'd just like to have my check please
I'm not trying to be a tease
Finding time is such a squeeze
And, my, you're a squeeze too!

I could be writing a fairytale
Or an epic poem, as the Odessey
But with Frost and Homer
Why, that seems so obselete.
So I will walk the road travelled by every other 
Poor son of a bitch who's ever 
Fallen for the tender lies you were told as a child. 
And though it may seem rather mild, 
I must insist I'm going wild
And I'm going at it alone.

I was going to write a poem
About something important
Something meaningful.
However, I got lost in thought
Deep, provocative, meandering thought
More than I could ever want
So please forgive this nonchalance
If I'm not sorry this isn't a poem.

No, my friend,
Indeed it isn't 
It's something I find
Far less pleasant
Unless, of course, you're an emo kid
At which point, this may seem elementary.
But I've been searching through my pantry
And can't seem to find the canned beef
That is my food for thought.

No, indeed, what this is
Is far more tremulous
Much like a convulsion, shimmy if you will
Shaking so hard
I'm afraid that I'll spill
Out my guts all over the floor
And I won't be pretty anymore
With my guts about the floor
And then you'd walk away.

Have a seat, please relax for a bit
For this is just beginning to end
We've still much to say
Still wounds to tend
Whoops, there I go again
Ranting again
Shaking again
Faking again.
Pretending to be aching again.

I'm really quite content with this content
English is a beautiful thing
More crisp than your starched collar
More sharp than a bee sting.
Canter, banter, wambamshmanter
Look, I'm making up words!
Haven't you heard?
I find that absurd!
Would you like some bean curd?
And all for the sake of a rhyme.

I was going to write a poem
But I seem to have gotten carried away
Swept away
Conjured away
By promises I've not even made
By little boys I've never met
By amazing people I don't know yet.
I was going to say something deep,
Something profound.
But I've found that the profound
Is too down to Earth
If you know what I mean."

We'll cut out bodies free from the tethers of this scene,
Start a brand new colony
Where everything will change,
We'll give ourselves new names (identities erased)
The sun will heat the grounds
Under our bare feet in this brand new colony
Everything will change, oOo oOo...

So, 3 posts today. Am I trying to compensate for something? I have no idea. I have a void.I've been throwing random things in it for the past week, and it's slowly filling up, but not all the pieces fit. This isn't entirely as bad as it appears, it's just a frustration. So, right. Back to history...again. Cocking homework."

"event","I toootally got to see Jesse today for the first time in MONTHS! Aaagh! He and Ruka and I all went and hung out and went to dinner at Twin Dragons. It was completely happy. That makes two of my friends that have moved back (yay!) and one who is visiting and I've got to hang out with all of them. It pleases me immensely. Muaha. Oh! AND I did my homework, AND I did well on the bio quiz so that grade should be rising presently. Now just to focus on history. I have until Friday to get that up and I think it will happen. All these hard-ass teachers are being extremely compromising with me and it's very nice. So all in all today was good. Well, I have like a buttload (which is a lot) of history homework to do for tomorrow, so I'm going to go, and oh? What's that? I'm going to DO my homework? Noooo! Nononono. You're kidding! I'm not! Oh, you are! No really, I'm going to do homework. Indeed. I leave you with an amusing conversation between my friend and myself. Farewell. Or farebad. Or whatever.

Me (8:25:52 PM): i'll kick your ass
Him (8:26:40 PM): oh, yeah? i'd like to see you try
Me (8:27:26 PM): You're on! Biotch!
Him (8:27:31 PM): yeah, bring it
Me (8:27:40 PM): Oh, it's been brung
Me (8:27:48 PM): it's been broughten
Him (8:28:21 PM): yeah you brought it and it didn't do jack, what now!
Me (8:29:12 PM): it didn't do jack cause it was too busy doin you!

Peace!"

"event","And you will lay it all before me
A cornucopia
Laden with festivities
Quick! Look down
The horizon is gone
Vanished behind the
Ever-clear sun

And it's too possible
You're not playing fair
It's cold indoors
Crushed glass beneath the chair
Shards of gone
Pieces of done
Ah, ah, ah

Ferocious candid roller skates
Your magnetic poetry
Rolling through my gates
Sand, sand, oh, blow me
Shine my little disease
Wooo, blowing through the trees
Falling to my knees
God, these damned skinned knees

And it's too possible
You're not playing fair
It's freezing in the hearth
Broken glass stuck in your hair
Shards of footprints
Pieces of tracks
All going the wrong direction...

You'll say it's okay
You'll promise you are too
And I'll sit here
Promising that I believe you
That I do
I promise you
Mmm, mmm, Hey Slim.
I don't eat that shit. 
I don't
I don't want to

And it's too possible
You're not playing fair
My fingers wrought with ice
Bits of glass breaking your stare
Sneaking by
The bitter sky
No, I don't
Buy that."

"event","I've heard that history repeats itself but who knew it would be under the exact same circumstances at the exact same time just on a different day?
School called home again. Mom freaked. Was all a load of bull. Stress. Lost an amazing friend for a while today. I freaked. Bloody nose resulted. Stress. Locked myself out of my car. More bleeding. Stress. Had to find some way to smile for the customers for the remaining 3 hours of work. Stresssss. And yet, I can't find the strength to cry. I'll miss you so much."

"event","A cookie cutter lifestyle
Thoroughly examined
Through the eyes of a petri dish
It's brutally clear
That his eyes are still wet
A special fatality
Keyed out in plain jibberish
A single heartbreak
Is too much too take
Too little at a time
Singapore isn't out of reach
The mallet stretches much farther than you think.


So. I'm going to Chicago on Friday. [enthusiasm] Woo. Hoo. [/enthusiasm]"

"event","Assume the Position

Common knowledge
Knows only how to presume
A sense of security constantly sought
Won through wars never actually fought
You'll change a new font
It's nice now, fresh paint
In this world based on assumption
I'll take to sinner, not to the saint
Seeking rancid inspiration 
From the lines of the conspirators
Leads only to bruised elbows
The cleanliness of a curator

Don't dazzle with wine
Don't consume with ignorance
You know as well as I
These figures of incompetence
Protruding veins 
Sheilded by flesh
Are constant reminders
Of the silken black sash
Now laced gently about a stocky neck
Glamour from regalia never comes
Vertically restrained reddened thumbs
Forever delaying
The progression of sound
A soliloquy of thought
More silent, more round
And these poor little faces
Are eternal confound
Assume the position
Societal glare
A sad little smile
Lacking only dispair
And the boy
Oh dear, what came of him?
He said, for he was made to
He had to say
Goodbye."

"event","So, the first meet of the season went remarkably well for our team. For those of you who graduated and still want to keep up I'll announce names.

Caleb and Ami G. won CX Debate. Caleb received 3rd place Speaker, and Ami 1st place Speaker.
Kelley O. received 5th place in Drama, and PAULA WIGGAM GOT FIRST! LIKE HOLY SHIT!!!
Paula and Simone broke to finals in Impovisational Pairs, and would like to announce it was their first time ever doing the event, and they still kicked ass. They received 7th. But still kicked ass. More on that later.
Eric K. broke to Semi-Finals in Humor.
I received 4th place in humor. 
There were over 700 competitors total. Cheyenne East High School took 12 people, and received 2nd place overall in the sweepstakes, proving that we do, truly kick ass.

This was a very exciting meet. Both Paula and I double broke to finals in both our events, one of which we'd never competed in. I received my next NFL degree in one meet. It feels good to do well in your first meet. It feels really good to do well in a difficult meet. It feels really super fucking good to do well in your first meet which is difficult and in fucking Colorado where it's ever-so-hard to please the judges. I am...satisfied.

In other news, I am leaving for Chicago for another meet on Friday, November 18. I'm so excited! And this weekend was excellent preparation. Marvelous. That is all."

"event","I went to Casper and am feeling less under the weather than before. AND haven't cried in over 12 hours and so that's like thumbs up! Uhm let's see. Today is my first speech meet of the season. On top of that, my first time ever being entered in improvisational duet. I'm doing it with Paula. She's freaking, I'm beaming. I love making shit up on the fly. Sure blows that sexual innuendos aren't allowed though. Suck. Well anyway, I left my cell phone in my mom's fiance's car so I won't have it for a few days. So I'm not ignoring your calls, and I'll return them if they're worth my time. Haha. Just kidding. Well, I still need to go pick up my suits and lisence plate tags from my dad's house so I'll be seeing y'all later.

Oh, and codename ""Powderpuff"" I hope you got a ride since I never heard back from you. Ask Calvin how the thing with that blonde side dish went, I'd like to know. Catch you later."

"event","And boy, do they fall hard. It's funny how it always comes at once. Or maybe we just don't notice until it does all come...or go, I guess. He's gone. Work's gone. School, which I would very much love to be gone is the only thing I have left. And it all happened in the last 6 hours. I was already having a hard time swallowing today, but this is unbearable. Actually, smashing my face into the pavement seems so attractive right now, it's lucky that I'm inside. I don't want death. But I want physical pain enough to rival what's going through my head right now. I dropped the ball and they dropped the bomb. But if the shoe fits, right?

Tracy and I scored a place, so we'll be moving in there next week. Wonder how my dad is going to take that? Hmm...So yeah. SAT tomorrow...and All State Orchestra Auditions...and working the Novice Meet...and breathing...can't forget the breathing. Well love you guys. Give me a ringaling sometime."

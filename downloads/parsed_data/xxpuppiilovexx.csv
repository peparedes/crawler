"event","Today was very fun yet just a lil akward. It started off with me and my mom shopping for an hour or 2. then <BR>Olivia surprised me again comming over my house. Then we talked and shit and went online. Then, Lisa called and asked if she can come voer too and i was like umm ok.. Then all of us were here bored so we decided to go to the kendall mall and hang out there. I called Victor and he came outside and met us half way. We all walked together to the kendall mall for no reason at all.. lol&nbsp; then wen we got there Robert just got out of college so he hung out with us for a lil. Then after we were messing around with the shopping carts and stuff and Robert hit a car by accident so then he elft back to college. lol . Then we left a cart in the street by accident and some lady drove by saying we were trying to hit her car or something like that and started bitching. Then she asked Lisa to move the cart out of the street nicely. Lisas dumbass goes "" i didnt put it there some other kid did "" and the lady started bitching and i didnt want all of us to get in trouble so i moved it cuz those dumbass's were just standing there clueless. but w.e . Then wen we were about to talk back home and security came up to us saying that the dumb lady was telling him we were trying to hit her car and stuff.. and were just like .. ""wtf?"" and w.e so we just left and walked home. Then after watchin t.v for a lil while Olivia n Lisa left so me and victor walked to Starbucks and got coffees and then walked back home.We hung out at my house and watched "" Joe dirt "" for the hundredth time (literally). Then we started to fall asleep when we heard a loud ass banging at my front door. I looked out my window and saw my x's car and i just laughed. a lil advice for you. if ur trying to do a prank or something. Dont park ur car right on the side of the house were there are windows. LoL the even funnier thing is that the person that ran out of the car and did the prank, ran right past my window so i saw him perfectly. and i kno exactly who it was. lol but w.e .. my mom said shes gonna file a police report if it happens again. well im sick of writin.

The main thing I like about this picture is the picture of the male, female and the handicap 'people'. I think that the way the person draw this picture is very nice.Somehow I think that if every restroom in Singapore has either the male,female or the handicap 'person', the toilets will look more high-class.This is my point of view, may be weird to you, but this is what I think.&nbsp;<br />The way the 'people' look are very cute..haha.. :D</font>"

"event","<br />&nbsp;<font size=""3"">Well..the most memorable that took place in the class was 20th Feburary, which is my birthday on that day! Haha... That day I thought that only some of my close friends will give me cards or presents, but that day I receive quite a lot of birthday presents and cards. I was very grateful as this was the first time I receive so many presents on my birthday. Normally I don't tell people my birthday, but because our class have a notice board which writes the birthday of each person in 2F. I thought that board won't really be bothered by my classmates, but it turn out the other way. I am very happy and it will always be in my memories</font>."

"event","<p><br /><font size=""3""><br />Well, the debate carried out during the EL-MRL week is a very nice event as it let us get out of those boring and not really interesting lessons. The debate also let us think more, challenges us to think fast in order to win although there won't be any prize. The motion of the debate briefly means that whether we should use project work as our assessment marks. Well, the boys are the proposition while the girls are the opposition. This topic although quite simple, but we have to think very detailed so as to argue back our view points. I have learn a lot from this debate and learn some new stuffs too. </font></p>"

"event","<font size=""2"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 10-12 December 2007, my family and my friend's family went to Genting Highlands for a vacation.It was a very meaningful and wonderful, as well as a tiring trip in Genting. My family went there by coach while my friend&nbsp;went there by car, which is much more comfortable than the&nbsp; coach.""So lucky!"" I thought. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first day, both families, went to the indoor theme park in the evening.&nbsp;Both of our parents bought our individual tickets for the rides in the indoor stadium. At that time, I wasn't feeling well, therefore my brother and my friend went to take the rides. Then, we went to a exihibition called ' Ripley's Believe it or not '. It shows us a lot of unbelievable things which challenge us to believe it. I believe some, not all actually,but was very amazed by the exihibition. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second day of the trip, it is much better compared to the first day as we get to play the indoor and outdoor theme park for the whole day. There was one ride in the indoor theme park which made me quite angry. We actually que up for a 4D movie in a maze for 45 minutes, standing and seating throughout the queing time. Well,that night&nbsp; I went to my friend's hotel for a sleepover and follow them the next day back to Singapore by car.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really enjoyed the second day alot as well as the other moments in this trip.I hope there will be more to come, obviously&nbsp;not this holiday as it is coming to an end, but the rest of the holidays.</font>"

"event","<font size=""2"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,it was a very fun and meaningful camp as I have learned a lot of stuff from the camp.I learned that actually sometimes people think that they don't have some&nbsp;characters like patience, gentleness, etc.However,we have! It's always with us,but we didn't know it.It also depends whether you are willing to exercise like for example, patience.Ya, it let me realise that I can change into a better person to spread God's word and make good friends, and more. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also enjoy the games that I played.It's very fun especially this game which is similar to 'The Game of Life'.The main objective of the game is to buy materials to build a church.We have to earn money by playing games.Then, we can buy materials too build our church.Do you know that the games also included natural disaster and persecution?It's very interesting, but horrible as they make us suffer.This games actually train us how do we as a team work together, being chose to do the right thing and our enthusiasium. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would like to say that I hope there are more of this kind of camp coming up!</font>"

"event","<p>Time really flies.The second week of the holiday has gone.I am left with about&nbsp;six more weeks to the new year.The second week is similiar to the first week.Except that on the wednesday of that week,after my band practice which ends at 1pm.I went to my church to help out from 3.15pm till 5.25pm,then my mother called me to meet her at Toa Payoh to see her friend who is suffering from depression.We meet each other near 7pm,had our dinner and went to meet my mother's friend in Tan Tock Seng hospital.From the time when my mother speak to her friend to the time when she prayed and we left,I learn a lot from my mum and her friend's conversation.I learn that one has to value oneself and not to waste his/her life on Earth.We should treasure our lives,make use of it like caring one another,using your talents and strenght to make the society beter and so on.It was a meaningful night in the hospital listening to my mother's advice.I have also learn that my mother is not the mother who always scold me and my younger brother,but a very caring and understanding mother.<br />The secong week of this holiday is a meaningful one,isn't it?^^</p>"

"event","<p>After the first week of school holiday,I started to feel very bored.On Monday,Thursday and Friday,I was at either watching TV,doing work,reading story books or playing the computer games.It is very boring as you have to do these things over and over again till Janurary 2008.On Tuesday and Wednesday,I have to go to band for my practice.Actually,I can go out with my friends,but I did not bother to ask my friends,and I wasn't really that kind of shoping girl.Therefore,I have to stay at home doing my stuff and this will carry on till December.Looks like I am going have a boring November holiday,lying around the house,doing homework and playing computer games.Maybe I should go for some course that suits my interest,so at least I can learn something during the holidays.However,I am looking forward to the December holiday because I will be going to camps and overseas.I hope time flies!^^</p>"

<font size=""+2"">Your Social Dysfunction:<br />Happy</font><br /><br />
You're a happy person - you have a good amount of self-esteem, and are socially healthy.  While this isn't a social dysfunction per se, you're definitely not normal.  Consider yourself lucky: you walk that fine line between 'normal' and being outright narcissistic.  You're rare - which is something else to be happy about.<br /><br />

"event","MSU didn't win last night. It was one team's defeat, but for myself, it was a victory. I felt happier last night than I have in a really long time. I felt crazy. I felt free. I was sixteen again. Around 8:00, I went over to Shawna's house. Elizabeth was already there. We waited for Jen. Together, we all strolled over to Drew's. We batted our eyelashes, cooing, ""Oh please, please come with us."" With that, we piled into our cars. Drew, Eli, Shawna, Jen, and me. It was like a piece of history that had come back. We watched the game with Joe and Cathey, and then headed out to East Lansing. The bars were closed by the time we got there, and the craziness was unfolding. Two helicopters patrolled with spotlights, and police came armed in full SWAT gear. The bars had their doors locked with towels underneath the doors to keep the teargas out. A few hundred people stood in the streets. It was midnight on a Saturday, and the bars were closed. How can this be? I just wanted a pina colada! Haha. 

Drew, Shawna, Eli, and I stood on the street wondering what to do next. Across the street, I saw Ben and Bub. I pointed them out to Shawna, and she said, ""Let's go see what they're up to."" We started to cross the street, but it was too late. Teargas was flying. People were screaming and running. Shawna grabbed my hand and we took off, hoping to run faster than the people behind us. It was the Run of the Bulls, minus the bulls. About 200 people went sprinting down M.A.C. It was crazy! We crossed Grand River, and all looked at each other like, ""Is this really happening?"" People were still cheering, ""GO Green!"" ""GO White!"" Ben and Bub walked up, and we stood around talking. Six kids from Mason, five years out of high school. It was nostalgic. The night ended after another teargasing. Everyone was running, yelling, and choking. ""My eyes are burning!"" Drew screamed. It was intense. After our throats and noses stopped burning, we had a good laugh of it all. ""My parents cannot find out about this,"" Shawna threatened. ""We've got 5 more hours till church,"" Drew smirked. 

Something about last night made me feel alive again. For a moment, we got back the elements we once had: Good Friends, The Middle of the Night, Fast Running, Police, 2 Guys we picked up along the way, and Never a Dull Moment. It was like old times. Part of The Crew lives on. Some may not agree, but I know that it lives on in Me."

"event","I'm the worst journal writer. Perhaps that's why I never write anything here. I'll look at this blank screen for hours. I'm always so afraid to write anything that I won't mean in a week. I don't know why. I'm scared, I guess. In 5 years, I want to look back at what I've written and think, ""Hey, I remember that. Those were good times."" But if I were really honest in these entries, I'd be looking back in 5 years, saying, ""Awww. Why don't you cry about it!"" I guess I just want to choose what I remember. Can you blame me?

Here I am, in a room full of junk. I'm surrounded by clothes and trinkets. It's my last week at the apartment. Most of my things have already been moved out. That includes the lawn chair that once used to sit at my desk. I'm now left sitting on a laundry basket full of clean towels. Ridiculous, I know. 

I'm suddenly very tired. I don't even know why I started this entry. I'll at least tell a story or two to make it somewhat worth sending. Last night was Scott's birthday. The whole Best Buy crew headed out to BW3 (I can't spell dubb's) to celebrate. Shawna, Eli, and I went to the bar and ordered drinks. And was it my lucky day? No! For the unstable bartender lady was working. The last time I was there, she told me I wasn't allowed to come to the bar anymore. She was serious when she yelled at me. Why? I have no idea. Sorry lady, I don't speak psycho. 

Onward. My first drink was gone before we got back to our seats, and I headed back to the bar for a refill. I'm standing in line thinking, ""Please don't get the crazy lady. Please not her."" I lucked out. ""I'll have a sex on the beach,"" I told the guy. He poured a drink for the girl next to me, and then walked away. I stood there patiently, when poof! appeared Miss Tons-A-Fun. ""What can I get you?"" Ummm. I guess a sex on the beach?? Two minutes later, the guy appeared with my drink, just as she had finished pouring the other one. Ooops. She knew as soon as she saw it. She picked up the drink, and slammed it on the bar behind her. To avoid the yelling in progress, I told the guy I actually wanted both of them. Note that the place was packed, and we were all standing. There I stood with a drink in each hand. By the end, Brandy=Tipsy. I made my way to the bathroom. And on my way back, I suddenly realized that everyone was much taller than me. I'm short, don't get me wrong, just not that short. That's when strangers yelled, ""Are you okay?!"" Then they proceeded to pick me up off the floor. :) 

It turns out someone had dropped a drink, and the floor was soaked. The guy was just arriving with the wet floor sign. It was very amusing. At the time, I was feeling happy. I didn't even know I fell. I simply thought everyone was very tall. After they picked me, I exclaimed, ""Huh! I was on the floor!"" Just another great time in East Lansing on a Thursday night. 

Speaking of night...
Young and Dumb,
      Brandy"

"event","So... it's kind of late. Isn't it always? It seems that way. Tonight, I'm collecting thoughts. So I figured I probably have too many, and I should give some away. I was sitting here reading old e-mails. Staring at the screen, I just opened the first folder. A. A is for Alex. It's funny the e-mails I chose to keep. I do delete many. Only the important ones stay locked in a folder. But now, reading over them... they don't seem that important. I realize maybe they never were. An e-mail is just a thought. Somewhere, someone was thinking about you and wanted you to know it. I moved on to the next folder: Fern. It seems silly after all this time, that he's still Fern to me. I guess he'll always be. For as long as I'm his Merry. The Fern folder was much longer than I expected it to be. And I could tell you exactly why I kept each letter from him. It may have been 11K, but I saved it because he signed it~ sweet dreams, Merry. He was always very nice to me. There is so much I have forgotten. But if it means anything, I remember you."

"event","Taadaa! I have a journal! Thanks to Meg! She's awesome. So... Now what? Does thing come with a panic button? Or am I on my own? I see... I'm not shy, so here goes... 

Yesterday, I officially moved to Michigan. It was very unlike a vacation. Usually, I'm instantly surrounded by people I love. Smiling faces, as they shove each other out of the way to talk to me first. They rapidly spout off the events I'll be attending for the next week. I smile and nod, and never hear a word they're saying, because my own thoughts drowned them out. ""Am I really home? I'm hungry. She looks great. He looks too thin. My lips are dry. Is it safe to take out my Chapstick? Or will he make me eat it? Maybe he's changed. Maybe everything's changed. God, I miss them all.""

But not this time... There was only one smiling face, but it was enough. Steve. He's still like a big brother to me. He's all grown up now and student teaching in Mason. I'm so proud of him. We left the airport and went straight to Bob Evans. It's kind of a tradition. It's more of a necessity. Eleven hours, and all I'd eaten was the peanut butter & jelly sandwich that Steven had packed for me. Isn't he cute? :)

Steve and I caught up on life, and then he dropped me off at home. I took a nap, and then Sal and I talked for a bit. Maude, my perfect blue Passat, was in the shop. Shawna had to go to work. The door shut. There I was, all alone. I had no car. No Meg. No one I really wanted to call. So I did what anyone in my place would do... I picked up the mail off of the table and started clipping coupons. It's something I started doing in California, and now I'm an addict. Everything is so expensive there that it's essential. But now it's just fun. 
 
Time went on, and I had all my coupons in rows on the floor. The good pile. The bad/expired pile. The haven't-yet-looked-at pile. Suddenly, the door flew open. Joe walked in and sat down on the couch. ""What are you doin'?"" he demanded. Noticing the coupons, he laughed, and started ripping on me. It was just what I needed. My first day back, and I'm already taking crap from Joe. :) He said, ""We're going to Meijer. Do you wanna go?"" And I knew I was home."

"event","The rain was pouring down that night. I waited at the stoplight. Out of the corner of my eye I saw this little mouse. He ran across the first lane. Then the second, third... sixth lane of traffic. As soon as he got across the last lane, the light turned green and the cars started to go. For that one moment, it was as if traffic had stopped solely for this little mouse. I wondered where he was going. I wondered if he even knew. All I could think was: Sometimes you take a chance. When you succeed... It's nothing but Victory."

"event","Okay, I can do this.  Hello, my name is Teesa, and I am a geek.

I've read the Potter books far more than I ever should admit to, and I adore them.  If pushed, I can probably dredge up a quote from each book.  So, to say that I have high hopes for every Potter movie is probably an understatement.

Chamber of Secrets has a unique distinction, because of what I saw onscreen last night, I have no complaints.  My sole complaint is what <i>didn't</i>  make it onto the screen.  

I'm a realist.  I know that things are bound to get cut.  And no, none of the scenes that were cut were important, in the frame of the plot.  All the plot points were there.  But, what was lost was some of the minor points that would have given the movie a better flow.  Instead, it came off feeling rushed, like director Chris Columbus was rushing headlong towards the climax, and anything that got in the way of that was ditched.  New characters were introduced, and then ignored, no characterization needed.  Only a handful of them made any impact.  

Colin Creevey, in the books so gleefully annoying, got all of three scenes.  Justin from Hufflepuff?  One scene.  He wasn't even a blip on the radar.  Professor Sprout?  A handful of lines, though granted, she did make them count.  Professor Binns, the ghostly history teacher?  Didn't even bother with him.

So, while I enjoyed what I was seeing, there was a nagging feeling that something more should have been there, more of why Gilderoy Lockhart was such an annoying prat, singing Valentine dwarves, and dammit, more Snape!

Now, as to what was good...

Kenneth Branagh was a wonderful choice for Gilderoy.  Smug, smarmy and wonderfully cowardly, he came across perfectly.

Alan Rickman.  During the dueling club scene.  Oh yes.  His little strut onto the dueling platform and the smug-ass way he bitchslapped Lockhart was utterly perfect.  I, once again, bow to the god of overacting.

Richard Harris.  Ah, they're going to have a bitch of a time finding a Dumbledore that can even approach him.  He makes scenes with a phoenix puppet look good.  That takes something special.  

Jason Isaacs as the deliciously evil Lucius Malfoy.  Oh, my.  Utterly perfect, down to the casual violence inherent in every motion. His scenes with Harry rank as some of the most chilling in the movie.  And, damn, that is a pretty man.

Christian Coulson as Tom Riddle.  (Or as Jess calls him, the Almighty Evil Overlord o' Scrabble.)  Holy hell.   A.  Gah.  That is one pretty man.  B.  Holy hell, he's evil.  Even with his part pared down to  near nothing, he came through as utter evil.

Tom Felton is truly growing into the role of Draco.  Last year, he was an annoying sneering brat.  This year, he's managed to inject some actual malice into his performance.  It's beautiful to behold.

Emma Watson is growing into her Babe-in-Waiting status admirably.  If they can keep the kids for the fourth movie, it should be a killer to see her all dressed up.  She rarely gets much to work with here, though her scene in Hagrid's hut hinted at a newly increased acting ability.  Oh, and her end scene, with Harry and Ron--genius.  

Rupert Grint took all of the promise of the last movie and blew it away.  The boy has amazing comic timing, and is just cute as all hell.  His scene with Lockhart as Harry goes down to the Chamber alone was a stroke of pure joy to behold.  His voice cracks more than a few times during the movie, which is just adorable.  And he holds the record for the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in a movie.  Slugs anyone?

Daniel Radcliffe.  I don't care what you have to do to keep him on for the fourth movie and beyond, but whatever it is, just do it.  He's grown into the role, turned into a wonderful actor, and quite honestly, I can't imagine the franchise resting on anyone else's shoulders.  The movie is after all, <i>Harry Potter</i> and the Chamber of Secrets.  If your Harry doesn't work, nothing else will.  For a thirteen year old to be able to not only handle the burden, but to handle it with a total lack of self consciousness is astounding.  Adults have fallen under lesser burdens (see Batman's Val Kilmer or George Clooney for examples.) yet he thrives, bringing a solid core of goodness to Harry.  We like him, we believe that he really is that honorable, we want him to succeed.  You're not going to find another like him.  

Part of the utter coolness that is JK Rowlings series is the continuity--watching the child grow to man, watching the fumbling steps to adulthood, the trials, the missteps.  If you switch children after the next movie, you lose some of that.  Right now, I really <i>want</i> to see Harry grow up, come of age.  I don't want to lose that.  I hope we won't.  

And when they're making the next one, I hope with all my might that they're willing to sit back and let it develop at it's own pace, instead of crushing it into under three hours.  We'll sit and watch it, trust me.  If you have to, put an intermission in it.  No one will complain, believe me."

I have a theory, and that theory is that movies are sort of like ice cream. You have the bizarre, disgusting ones like old bay and garlic flavors.  You have the old reliable flavors like vanilla and chocolate, each altered just a little bit by their assortment of toppings.  And then you have something called sweet cream, a flavor that actually manages to be blander than vanilla and leaves you thinking, did I eat something?

Guess which flavor I'm going to compare Minority Report to.  Go on, guess.

Sadly, I'd normally avoid this movie for just that reason.  It's a Spielburg/Tom Cruise/John Williams vehicle, for Christ's sake. A movie simply cannot get more mainstream popular lowest common denominator than that. And yet we thought, nooo, it can't be that bad. Spielburg's gotten more and more subversive.  AI made me question humanity (before making me want to gouge my eyes out with a spork) and had some pretty images. Besides, it was Phillip K. Dick. How bad could it be?

Um.  

The story basically runs like this.  The year is 2054, the place Washington DC, and by a system known as Precrime murder in that city has been eliminated.  Suspects and victims are predetermined by clairvoyents, and arrested before the crime can be committed.  Enter John Anderton, a man in charge of his department at precrime, a drug addict and a father who lost his son 6 years ago. And John Anderton is then accused by the system he trusted.  Yadda yadda, and if you've missed this you've obviously not watched much TV or seen any movies lately.

It's an interesting story, with room for exploration on themes of justice and revenge, safety vs. freedom, human fallibility and the agony of being a precognitive, with even a little bit of discussion on the death penalty and criminal rights.  However, the script writers took that nifty idea and turned it into a reason for Tom Cruise to run around and look cool for two and a half hours.  They even came up with a catch phrase and an inexplicable happy ending that left more questions than it solved.

The movie is shot in a fairly straight-forward manner, barring the occasion 'whee, look at how artsy and cool our movie is' sliding shot.  In fact, the whole thing is fairly straight forward.  Even wholesome, for a Phillip K. Dick story.  This is like Bladerunner light.  There is some dirt and grunge, and a few jarring images (the precog visions had a very dark, creepy feel to them, almost like the visions used in From Hell, and Anderton's dealer is one of the few images to really stick and stick hard), but overall... for a major metropolitan area in the future, everything certainly seems sparkly fresh.  And not just the set. Even the sticky points, like the ethics of this entire system, are discussed once and then glossed neatly over. Anderton's wife forgets about that silly missing son thing and jumps back into his arms. Anderton doesn't question whether or not he should steal one of the precogs to prove his innocence, even though it makes it impossible to predict murders and assaults of innocent people. The precogs don't resent being kept in a box, drugged up and fed on a tube for most of their lives.  All nice and neat.

Tom Cruise played the same character he normally plays, tweaked a little bit here and there.  In the moments when he was just John, a grieving father at the end of his rope, everything's cool.  There's a scene near the beginning of the movie where he's on a drug called neuroin, watching home videos of his family, that manages to be heart-rending.  However, that characterization doesn't last longer than the next big exciting chase scene.  Apparently neuroin is the most forgiving drug in existence. On occasion you forget that the movie is about Anderton, and you're not just watching Tom Cruise make an ass of himself. (Which may not be entirely his fault; you become the biggest movie star in America and barring prosthetics and a voice over, your presence in a movie is bound to be a touch invasive.)

Colin Farrell, meanwhile, deserves some sort of award for bringing life to a two-dimensional character.  He played a Federal investigator sent in to check the legitimacy of the Precrime experiment. As we all know, ever since Die Hard a Fed brought into a police unit equals much badness for all. Farrell manages to play his arrogance and yet keep several layers going at once. (Better than Cruise, even.  Why is he the best actor in the universe again?) My interest dropped sharply once his character was removed.

And then there was a cast of relatively minor characters. Lois Smith did a very creepy, yet oddly cool job as the woman who created the Precrime program only to disappear from society once it was implimented.  Max von Sydow did an excellant job of playing director Lamar Burgess... I think.  His character was so schizophrenic and scattered from one scene to the next that it's hard to tell. Daniel London played Wally, the precog caretaker, and manages to make the character both bizarre and somehow poingant. Samantha Morton played Agatha the precog with creepy aplomb, and deserves credit for dealing with schizophrenic characterization and for spending half of the movie underwater with her eyes open.  John Williams provided the score, which was about as invasive as always. 

And that was Minority Report.  I would give more of a description, but my mind is one big sweet-cream flavored blank on everything else. This movie gets a nice bland medium, not necessarily worth paying 8 bucks for.  Wait for a matinee or a cheap second-run theater.  Go for the secondary characters. Bring earplugs for the opening and closing theme. Fear the bunny."

"event","Teesa: What can one say about Planet of the Apes?  A lot.  Sadly, one thing I can honestly say is that the venom Tim Burton spewed after the premiere of the movie was far more interesting and entertaining than anything onscreen.

Nix: I'd personally rather watch the footage of him trying to film this for two hours, instead. Action! as he flails in search of a word. Pathos! as he realizes that yes, they are out of coffee. Romance!... well. Never mind. But unfortunately, we get a brainless summer action movie that comes out looking like a pale imitation of some of his other projects.

Teesa: Where to start with what's wrong with this movie?  How about the star!  I like Mark Wahlberg.  I really do.  But when the script is threadbare of any emotion, you need someone who's capable of projecting his humanity, his fear, his angst.  Instead, we got Marky-Mark.

Nix: It's not really his fault. Some of his other work was, in fact, pretty good. Too bad for him that his character is not. Leo Davidson, space hero, human, the gladiator who would defy the... damn, sorry, wrong movie. Anyway, Leo is kind of a dick. (This actually becomes one of the better parts of the movie on subsequent viewings, and makes one wonder if it was completely unintentional.) His one and only concern during the first fifteen minutes is getting into space. His one and only concern during the next hour and a half is getting back to Earth.

Teesa: If a thought of anything outside of his little egocentric world pops into his brain, we,the viewers, are surely not privy to it.  He's shallow, selfish, and apparently without any morals, or discipline.  When he tells sympathetic ape Ari (played by Helena Bonham Carter) that he's going to ""Show her something that will change her world forever,"" instead of sounding meaningful, we're left wondering if he's confused Leo with a role from his past, the infamous Dirk Diggler.

Nix: As we learned with AI, it's usually not a good sign when half of the audience starts laughing at the pathos moments. Not that Leo gets any, besides the occasional heartfelt ""Jesus!"" at intense moments. Yes, Mark, Jesus wants you to emote, and we wouldn't mind it either.

Teesa: Okay, I think we've shredded Mark enough...now, onto the next great deficiency.  Would if have hurt that much to put a little backstory in?  I'm all for keeping the action going, but quite honestly, by the time we got to the ending (which we'll get to, believe me) there were enough holes in the plot and logic to strain cheese through.

Nix: Cheese and this movie. How appropriate. Reading through the script, some of those plot holes were explained. Which implies that someone shot themselves in the foot on purpose. This is rather inexplicable, seeing as most of the plot holes would have taken one line to fix. As is, we're left to wonder: who was the spaceship chick? Who was the third female ape at the dinner party? What the hell were they smoking? 

Teesa: My guess on the last one is ""Something strong, and a lot of it.""  And let's not forget my favorite question.  ""How the fuck did a bunch of apes become half human?""  Okay, they mentioned that they were genetically enhanced, but still.  Was there some besiality going on?  Did the weird time storm speed up their evolution?  Why did half the apes have British accents?

Nix: (*snerk*) Where did they learn to ride horses? Where did the horses come from in the first place? If there was a 4:1 ape/human ratio, why didn't they rebel before that? And for the love of God, where did Edward get the ice?! The dangling plot is one of the few truly Burton touches on this movie.

Teesa: Ah, and now, we get into the part of the movie that annoyed me most.  Visually, it was obviously a Tim Burton.  The lush, overly detailed sets could belong to no other.  The score, vivid and emotional, could only be an Elfman.  The weird-ass ending could only be a Burton.  The rest....did they get Spielberg?

Nix: My personal feeling is that Tim got cranky because they wouldn't put in his monkey lurve scene between Leo and Ari (a pointless gesture, seeing as theirs was the only chemistry in what was otherwise a vacuum, devoid of almost any personal relationships between the characters), so he decided to sleep through the direction. Either he's brilliantly subversive and he meant most of the movie to be a replay of most of the scifi ""epics"" ever done, or he really meant to basically make Gladiator with monkeys.

Teesa: Okay, now that we've shredded the movie, lets go with what I did like.  The actors who played the apes, to a one, were phenomenal.  Tim Roth is my new personal savior, as he managed to make General Thade both a figure of menace and pity.

Nix: The character of Thade was actually very well done, and one of the more interesting parts of the movie. Yes, he was basically a scary, irredeemable bad guy, but considering that in him one can see what humanity would do if one of the ""lesser species"" threatened to overthrow us, one can't say too much. In fact, the emotion in him, his initial infatuation with Ari and his scene with his dying father (played, amusingly enough, by Charleston Heston, and used to recite the evils of guns), makes him all the more chilling. It wasn't the sonorous growl that made Thade menacing, it was what went on behind Roth's eyes as he played him.

Teesa: In short, he made what by all rights should have been as much a caricature bad guy as Leo was the stereotyped hero, and turned it into a disturbingly human, flawed character.  

Nix: That same credit goes to Helena Bonham Carter, gifted with the best female role in this movie as Ari, the human rights activist. Yes, she was basically vulnerable and occasionally idealistic to the point of naivete, but she took that and made it admirable instead of simpering. Shed made it clear that she was Leo's equal, if not better. (Some of this might be somehow associated with her current relationship with Tim, but Bonham Carter is an impressive, incredibly strong actress in her own right.) 

Teesa: Ari was beautifully rendered, and truly one of the two truly sympathetic character in the whole movie.  When she offers herself to Thade in return for him sparing the humans, you're actually concerned for her welfare.  Her views may be naieve, but at least you feel like she believes them.

Nix: This explains why at the end of the movie, when Leo is standing between Ari and Dayna, the ""spunky"" human slave played by Estella Warren with all the personality of a board, I find myself leaning towards the bestiality. In fact, all of the apes were played with great skill, attention lavished on their characters to make up for the hard task of trying to emote through 3 inches of rubber mask. Paul Giamatti, who played Limbo, the amoral oranguataun slave trader, seems to have no trouble doing so. His personality comes at the screen in almost tangible waves. You end up liking Limbo. You don't really want to, but you do. He is the Lando Calrissian of this movie.

Teesa: Oh yes.  Limbo provides the film with it's few intentional laughs.  (It manages quite a few accidental ones. )  And I would be remiss if I didn't mention two other character who won me over.  Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Krull, Ari's manservant, and disgraced former captain of the ape army gives a wonderful performance.  (he must have, considering that I noticed him with the what, five lines he had.)  Michael Clarke Duncan also turned in a sterling performance as Attar, the current ape captain.

Nix: Poor gorillas. Both of their relatively small parts (Tagawa in volume, Duncan in actual character) got kind of pushed aside (along with most of the humans). They did a wonderful job with what they had, making you actually care about the characters a little bit. (""... Our horses, sir,"" is one of the better lines, just based off of Duncan's facial expression as he says it.) Also appearing were Kris Kirstofferson in a rather thankless role as Dayna's father, an almost unrecognizable Glenn Shaddix  as Senator Nardo, Lisa-Marie (Burton's then-girlfriend) as Nova, the chimp concubine with the ""sexy monkey dance"", and David (ave!) Warner as Ari's father, Sandar. Good actors, aplenty, doing their best with one or two lines.

Teesa: One or two crappy lines, no less.  Of course, having bitched heavily about the movie, then comes the question...why did we see it more than once?  Because, bad as it was, it beat the other ""blockbusters"" by a mile. And besides, it was in the vague hope that somehow, we'd find the answer to the question, What the hell was with the ending?? 

(Disclaimer:  Before you flame, we really do like Tim!  We think he's an amazing director, which is what made this so incomprehensible.  And, when it's all said and done, we didn't hate Apes.  It was just not quite what we'd expected from Tim.  But, we love him, and the movie anyway.  But damn, couldn't that score have been a little more heroic? *grin*)"

"event","Or, how I learned to stop caring and yearn to kick Stephen Spielberg in the head.

(If that doesn't warn you, bitchiness and mild spoilers ahoy.)

AI should be a good film. It really should. And, in fact, for the first 8/9ths of the movie it IS a good film. There's emotion. There's a realistic portrayal of humanity, its petty traits and its occasional redeeming moments. There's the first genuine child character I've seen in a Spielberg movie for quite some time in the far from angelic Martin (portrayed by Jake Thomas). There's wonderful acting from Haley Joel Osment (David), Frances O'Conner (Monica) and especially Jude Law (Gigolo Joe), who won my admiration with this performance. The movie was creepy, heart-felt, hopeful and at times chilling. (If you can watch that flesh fair without cringing at least once, you're tougher than I.) It was a good movie.

But.

But somebody apparently decided that this movie didn't have a chance at an Oscar unless it crossed that magical 2 hour mark. 

But somebody apparently decided that tacking on about a half-hour of the most cracked-out, tedious and eventually saccharine plot twist I have ever seen in my life was a good idea. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief to a reasonable point. But when said disbelief is wielded like a flashlight and used to beat me across the head for a half hour of my life that I'd really like to have back now, thank you, I get a little pissy.

Now, with all due respect to everyone involved with AI: I liked the movie. I wouldn't be so annoyed with the last half hour if I didn't. I would have walked out if I didn't have some faith in the fact that maybe they could redeem themselves. The acting was good, the imagery was good, the story was (basically) good.

But the last half-hour was an escalating car wreck of bad.

So. My recommendation to anyone who decides they want to see what the fuss is about is, either wait until you can rent it (which I wish I had done...) or make up your own ending and leave then. Whatever that ending may be, it'll surely be better than the one the movie gives you. 4 out of 5 for the first two hours, 0.5 out of 5 for the last."

"event","Okay. First things first: this is, in no way, a kid's movie. It's honest to God 3D anime. Despite the lack of blood or sex and the truly schizoid previews before the movie (Jeepers Creepers, Planet of the Apes and a Disney movie. Riiiiight...), it's a fairly dark movie. People die. People hold guns on each other. Freaky ass aliens called Phantoms suck souls out, leaving a crumpled shell of a body behind. It's not Disney.

That said, it's a beautiful movie. The graphics are amazing; it's hard to tell that it's computer animated unless you know going in. It's still got that slightly unreal quality, but it's a major step forward from the flat appearance of Toy Story and its ilk. The characters, especially Aki, are beautifully human, flaws and all. Cloth moves and flows with the people who wear it. Little details like liverspots or the shift of hair as someone moves, absent from most computer animated movies, are all over the place.

The story, though better than most summer blockbuster fare, is not quite as remarkable. Earth is left barren and littered with the remains of the dead 34 years after the crash landing of a meteor bearing strange aliens called Phantoms, who draw out the life forces of people with a touch. Humanity is scattered in little outposts, protected behind a shield that keep the Phantoms out, and trying desperately to find a way to destroy the threat. It's a toss-up between brute force or a more ""touchy-feely"" method, gathering 8 spirits to form a sort of spirit ray (it's better than it sounds...) that isn't guaranteed to combat the Phantoms. 

The premise can be broken down into those for the brute force vs. those in search of the spirits, and humanity vs. the Phantoms. It makes room for a lot of flying around, soul sucking, and nifty graphics. There are also some fairly cool themes involving the animistic belief that every living thing has a spirit, which come off well without becoming preachy. It's a nice change from the message of most spiritual movies, which is that you can be spiritual however you like as long as it's some form of Christianity. 

Another great feature of this movie is it makes you care about most of the characters. Aki (voiced by Ming-Na) is independent without being overbearing, emotional without being whiny, rare traits indeed for a female main character. Neil (Steve Buscemi), Jane Proudfoot (Peri Gilpin) and Ryan (Ving Rhames) bring some color to the stock characters of funny guy, butch chick and token gentle black guy; I'd love to have seen something more done with them. Dr. Sid (Donald Sutherland) as the mentor/head scientist is sort of just there, a disappointment considering the voice actor. Grey (Alec Baldwin) serves his purpose as the main male character; he didn't do much for me. The villian of the piece (voiced by deity James Wood) General Hein is wonderfully psychotic, made all the more disturbing by the fact that he thinks what he's doing is honestly the best for humanity, and brings with him the movie's darkest moments. One stands out in particular (you'll know if you see the movie; I won't spoil it for you) and it had my heart in my throat. It was a refreshing change from most one-dimensional ""bad guys"".

So. I liked this movie a touch, and if you enjoy sci-fi or anime, I definitely recommend it. It gets 4 of 5 (good story, wonderful characters and visuals, but it could have used a little more development instead of relying on stock characterization)."

"event","Why do I have a feeling that you won't have to look at the subject line to figure out who wrote these things?  Just look at the movie type, and you'll be set.

I'll admit it, I'm an action movie junkie.  I've gone to some truly crappy movies in the hopes of getting that adrenaline rush you get from a really good movie.  Unfortunately, I'm fast becoming more jaded.  I still don't require a particularly comprehensible plot, but I do need someone who's moderately believable in the role.  

After the Lost World, I swore that you couldn't convince me to go back to see another Jurassic Park movie.  It struck me as nothing more than a contrived paint by numbers attempt to cash in on the first one.  Of course, after all my swearing...they brought back Sam Neill, and added William H. Macy.

Let me explain, there are about ten people in the world that I would watch read the phone book.  William H. Macy is one, and Sam Neill is definitely another.  

To my surprise, the movie opened with a bang, and barely let up again.  There's a nice scene early in the movie with Sam Neill and Laura Dern that's nearly poignant.  Since JP, she's become an author, and settled down into a nice suburban life with a nice government worker.  I don't know whether it was intended or not, but both of them gave the scene a feeling of stilted comfort, a tension that didn't end with their relationship.  It was a nice change to see a movie that remembered it's prequels.

The plot is pretty minimal.  Idiot stepfather takes 12 year old parasailing near Isla Sorna home of the InGen breeding facility.  Accidents happen and they crash on the island.  12 year old's divorced parents trick Dr. Alan Grant into coming along on a rescue mission, not realizing that there are two Jurassic Park islands, and he was on Isla Nublar.  People get eaten, mayhem ensues.  

The dinosaurs get more and more realistic with each movie, and this is no exception.  The velociraptors are still the scariest thing on two legs, and with a minor makeover to some of them, it gives the pack an even more impressive look.  This time, there's a couple of new additions to the normal group of dinos, too.  There's the deeply frightening Spinosauris, which makes a T-Rex look small and docile, and there's the Pteradons, who provide some of the most genuinely scary moments of the movie.  

The lost twelve year old comes with some of the best lines in the movie, including a scene with Dr. Grant that actually provides some witty dialogue.

All in all, for what it is, JP III is worth the look.  It's not high drama, but it's a solid, albeit predictable thriller.

Rating:  3 out of 5, which is more than I'd have given any other movie so far this summer."

As fair warning, there will be spoilers ahoy, so if you want to go into Scary Movie 2 unsullied by bits of information that reveal its ever so intricate plot, you might want to stop reading. Or I might just have bored you into leaving already. Either way!

Okay, first I'd like to say that I did enjoy Scary Movie. It had its witty moments, and a spoof on all the teen slasher ""classics"" was well deserved. However, it did have those awkward moments, the various body fluid/fart/sex/penis/boobies/what have you moments where I sat staring at the screen wondering whether I was supposed to be amused.

Those awkward moments take up about 80 minutes of the 90 minute Scary Movie 2.

It's like all the inspired moments took refuge together, huddling close among the long stretches of stupidity. I didn't go in expecting Shakespeare, but the first five minutes (the deeply amusing Exorcist parody) duped me into thinking that it would be that good throughout. Um... no. Not so much. Besides the Exorcist parody mentioned above, the only truly inspired moments were mock-ups of non-horror movies (such as Titanic, Dude, Where's My Car?, Save the Last Dance and Mission Impossible 2), and even those get quickly lost. 

A brief note on minority groups: if you're going to make fun of them in your movies, laugh with them, because I could sure as hell tell when it turned to laughing at them. The movie wasn't too bad about that most of the time, but a few moments featuring the two characters with disabilities turned to the sort of immature nastiness you don't usually see off of grade school playgrounds. Thank you, script-writers, for making me cringe and yearn for something to throw at the screen.

The acting was, for the most part, good. James Woods proves himself as a god for his part as the older priest, delivering lines with a cutting deadpan. Tim Curry might as well have mailed in his performance. David Cross and Chris Stein deserve props for their bickering scenes alone. Anna Faris isn't afraid to mock herself, which is a good sign. 

So. In short, save your money, wait for it to come out on discount rental, and watch it with the fast-forward firmly in place. That or just watch the first five minutes and put it away. You won't be missing very much.

Rating: 1 out of 5, and that much only because of James Wood being god and all that."

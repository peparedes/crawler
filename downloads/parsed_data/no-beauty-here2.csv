"event","Okay, so I haven't written in this thing for the longest time, and just NOW it hit me that I had one of these things! hahah..Well anyway, to keep you updated on whats going on, I have a boyfriend his name is brett, and he's the most awesomest person I have ever met..But he's leaving me today to go to Texas to go see his mom..*tear*..so I don't get to see him again til next wed.!!!!..but we spent a couple hours together last night..So I guess I'll tell you about that!! Well, Dani took me to parker, to go pick brett up..and we didn't really sit by eachother at the time, I just gave him a hug when I saw him and went back and sat in the car. Then we ended up going to bryces house, but he wasn't home so we drove to this kid nicks house, and stayed there for a little while. We went up to their room or whatever, but I kinda felt outta place because I was the only ""emo"" there, and well lets just say one emo around 5 punks and 1 prep, doesn't always make a person feel so grand! anyway!!! They decided we were going to go outside because they wanted to smokey, and they didn't want us to smell like smoke *thank god* so we went outside. I kept saying I was cold, and brett being the sweet guy that he his tried to keep me warm, but well it didn't work considering he didn't bring a coat! haha..so then we all decided to go back to bryces, but he wasn't going to be home for another 20 mins so just me brett and dani sat in the car, because everyone else didn't want to..so I sat in the back with brett. And at the beginnging we really didn't hold hands or anything we just kinda poked eachother lol which was odd, but then we started holding hands, and he put his arms around me and stuff, it felt so good to have someone hold me..And then we droe to bryces and he still wasn't home yet so we sat in the car somemore, and me and brett cuddled some more :D, and he kissed me!! :D :D :D :D...and then after a while, his friends wanted to go to mCdonalds, so we drove them there, and me and brett stayed in the car and snuggled :D..but we both knew when we got back I had to go home..*tear*...so when we got back, he wouldn't let me go..:D..so I got out of the car and so did he, and we hugged and he kissed me twice, and he told me he wanted me to call him while he was in texas..and I told him I would...and that was basically the end of that!!...awwwww I miss my brett now...*tear*...

"event","today, I hung out with my mom..I haven't done that with just me and my mom in the longest time, I can't even remember the last time that I had done it, without jim being there..I'm just so happy that I could actually do that now..My mom told me she was taking steps to get rid of jim. Hopefully she'll really do it. if she does, I'll be able to go over to her house more often then I have. I just really do worry about her, more then anyone..And Today, I realized that I had almosy completley forgot what having a REAL mom is like..I didn't believe that could ever happen..but when you don't talk to your mom for such a long time, you tend to kinda forget you have one..and you hear everyone elses stories about their moms, and it hurts not knowing you have one there to be with you..but now, I hope things will change for the better..but until everything stops, and goes away..I can't say anything...

"event","Well, this is my new live journal!!! So anyway, I'm having second thoughts of liking Jon, coz lets face it guys, freshman-junior...it just doesn't work, I dunno..I think I might see if I can hook up with Ryan *not wolff*, he seems really cuwl, and awesome and everything..so yeah, but we'll see..and I'm giving up on alex because everyone at smokey hill had the same idea as me!! But thats okay, I can still be friends with him, and maybe I'll be lucky one of these days..I dunno..so we'll see..I miss all the people that I knew last year, I miss them a lot!!!...and I'm really worried about my mom, she hasn't payed the phone bill, so our phone is disconnected..she hasn't payed my braces bill, so they aren't comin off yet, and she's supporting Jim still..I dunno, maybe its just me but things seem to be going doooown hill from every point of view..so I dunno, and Today I've decided to take my religion more seriously, I'm going to be a better christan..because it sounds like something that will help me out with everything..well thats all for now..

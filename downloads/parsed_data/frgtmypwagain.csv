"event","I practiced, really practiced, for the first time in  long time last night.  I used all the elements: laid my hands in the fire,  the waters of the river  rain and ocean, stood upon the dirt of a 200 year old grave, and sang to the sky in a dead language.  Mother blessed me with a strong wind to caress me and then the fresh rain to wash my spirit.  I unleashed it all: the anger the tears the frustration everything and I recharged.  and then I came inside ... it was a good night.

listened to dead can dance last night when all was said and done and had forgotten just what incredible music it is...
In Power We Entrust the Love Advocated

Sail on silver wings through this storm what fortune love may bring
Back to my arms again the love of a former golden age
I am disabled by fears concerning which course to take
For now that wheels are turning, I find my faith deserting me

This night is filled with cries of dispossesed children in search of Paradise
A sign of unresolve that envisioned drives the pinwheel on and on
I am disabled by fears concerning which course to take
When memory bears witness to the innocence consumed in dying rage

The way lies through our love
There can be no other means to the end
Or keys to my heart you will never find
You will never find!


2. The Ubiquitous Mr Lovegrove

I thought that you knew it all
Well you've seen it ten times before.
I thought that you had it down
With both your feet on the ground.
I love slow...slow but deep.
Feigned affections wash over me.
Dream on my dear
And renounce temporal obligations.
Dream on my dear
It's a sleep from which you may not awaken.

You build me up then you knock me down.
You play the fool while I play the clown.
We keep time to the beat of an old slave drum.
You raise my hopes then you raise the odds
You tell me that I dream too much
Now I'm serving time in disillusionment.

I don't believe you anymore...I don't believe you.

I thought that I knew it all
I'd seen all the signs before.
I thought that you were the one
In darkness my heart was won.

You build me up then you knock me down.
You play the fool while I play the clown.
We keep time to the beat of an old slave drum.
You raise my hopes then you raise the odds
You tell me that I dream too much
Now I'm serving time in a domestic graveyard.

I don't believe you anymore...I don't believe you.

Never let it be said I was untrue
I never found a home inside of you.
Never let it be said I was untrue
I gave you all my time."

"event","Well here I am, me, myself.  not the poet not the witch not the dreamer.. Simply a man who loses himself occasionally and dreams a little to deeply.  I have wanted things and said things that have hurt people, and to all of you Im sorry it was unfair of me to keep you holding on when the demands on me were stronger than I cared to admit.  My brother has called me a coward and perhaps I am perhaps the cowardice comes in the form of holding onto a dream in the face of reality that says no matter how hard you want it the brevity of life and demands on the time and means you possess likely will keep it from ever happening.  So here I am selfish, a dreamer, far more dishonest to myself than to others (tho thru that dishonesty to me I am sure others have been misled) but most of all I am Patrick.  What that means I am not exactly sure but hopefully I am on the road that will lead me to the answers.  Once again to my friends I am so very sorry I have hurt you all,  that was never/ever my intent.  Dont mistake this post as a good bye ... rather a hello and a welcome back.

Lost to the world again
I have gone through hell recently, this crap with my brother hitting me harder than I would care to let most people know I kind of just cut myself off from everyone. If you dont like it oh well ...its who I am.... I have a lot of things to work out before I can be found ... when will it happen I dont know ...
lets examine this since it has seemed to be misunderstood 
1.I have gone through hell recently, this crap with my brother hitting me harder than I would care to let most people know
(well this seems pretty easy to understand, for most of my life it has been my brother and I against the world but he has turned his anger towards me and that hurt more than I could ever tell)
2.I kind of just cut myself off from everyone. 
(not terribly surprising seeing how just about everything in my life crumbled around me, on top of that I tend to be an introvert)
3.If you dont like it oh well ...its who I am.... 
(well thats just me being defensive)
4.I have a lot of things to work out before I can be found ... when will it happen I dont know ...
(hmmm 1200.00 cell bill, 3300.00 electric bill, no car, no bank account, no money to speak of, yup pretty fucking deep hole I put myself into, how long  will it take to dig myself out well see above ""when it will happen I dont know"")
so now you can all understand my ever so mysterious cryptic post.

Dreams surely are difficult, confusing, and not everything in them is brought to pass for mankind. For fleeting dreams have two gates: one is fashioned of horn and one of ivory. Those which pass through the one of sawn ivory are deceptive, bringing tidings which come to nought, but those which issue from the one of polished horn bring true results when a mortal sees them.

"event","Ok winter has finally set in here in Upstate NY, and as the little snow flakes flitter about in the air I find my ears drawn to music of my youth again.  At the moment I am reminded of just how beautiful Gordon Lightfoot's voice is.  Dude can flat out sing.  

I guess introspection is a cause to arrive here at livejournal  but you see I cant share incredible memories from past because there are just too few.  I will do my best to explain.

This is in deference to you new readers who have never heard my story:

1972 I was born, to two very loving and normal parents... wait scratch that.  omit the part after born.  my dad spent the moments of my birth locked in the embrace of our families baby-sitter.  Isnt it wonderful the happy memories your mother chooses to share with you? My father had for years pressured my mom to embrace the life of wife swapping and this final indignation broke her will I suppose because she did.  However you can find just as much blame in the mind altering effects of all the drugs they were ingesting.  Drugs in house werent bad ... ""drugs without control are bad"". So my childhood is dotted with stories of massive orgies and weekends at the nudists camps outside of Denver.  Oh yes my parents did work normal jobs... wait omit the part after work.  My parents were listed as the owners of Kitty's, a group of adult book stores, theatres, and nude models in Denver. So normal was never an option on my plate.  Now dont get me wrong we were well to do,  working for the real owners of these stores does have its benefits, the real owners are easily guessed but we wont go into that here but may be mentioned later as they come into play a few times in my life.  Our life for the most part was as normal as it could be under the circumstances and I like to point out to people that because I was born into it I never knew different and therefore had no basis for comparison.  The first and lasting event in my life took place when was 2.  How many of you out there have slid down the stairs on your butts.  Great fun huh? Well to a 6 year old and a 2 year old this activity took up long periods of time.  Leave it to young minds to improve on these fun things.  How about a sommersault down the stairs my brother suggested.  The tumble and the impact with head on tricycle at the bottom of the stairs would have dramatic but not immeadiate effects on my life. 
    I would love to regale you with lots of memories from my life but they arnt there.  As a matter of fact aside from a few snapshot memories here and there there are no memories.  You see the dr's say that impact was the likely cause of a cyst that formed under my skull and on the outside of my brain.  They described it like have a the pressure of a bowling ball pressing against my brain.  In laymans terms a concussion for 8 solid years.  Pathways and areas of my brain were destroyed they have told me.  The pain would have dropped adults to their knees in sobbing masses, but guess what once again I had no point of comparision and therefore thought that it was normal.  8 years till they found it, 8 years of that pocket of water growing and causing damage.  Memory was damaged, eyesight was damaged, hearing was damaged.  Then they discovered it and into the hospital I went. In 1976 they developed the CT scan technology, by 1982 they used it on me.  I have looked over my medical records and in the space of 6 weeks I went through over a thousand x-rays and 300 CT scans.  Guess what when you turn off the lights I glow, well not really but thats a lot of radiation to pump into a 10 year old.  So they decided on a course of action, drain the cyst or let me die.  I was brought into the operating room and kept lucid while they drilled a hole through my skull and drained the pressure away.  That sound remains locked in my mind to this day.  They induced a coma and there I lay for the next 2 weeks.  I obviously came through.  
    My parents had divorced when I was 8 and my father had obtained custody through rather neferious methods.  We bounced around alot moving from this place to that, always traveling.  My brother and I counted it up once and we were in 37 schools covering our academic lives.  Trials and tribulations abounded and my brother left home when I was 13.  My fathers physical abuse began about this time. Daily beatings, anger filled the house and then the final straw...a full out attempt on my life.  We were living in a hotel where my father could make his way up to the pool hall and hustle.  Either through malfunction or some other way the exhaust fan on a heater next to my bed came free and for two months I was slowly put through carbon monoxide posioning.  I grew grey lost a lot of weight and was slowly dying.  My brother returned around this time.  We ran away.  

I find myself rather drained now and will continue this story later where we will cover the carnival, drugs, marriage, murder and all the other fun things that have happened in my life.  For now though be well.

Till the future becomes the past.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I wander through the memories of my life 
Each standing like a tombstone 
The words are being worn away 
As they slip through my fingers 

I struggle to hold on to what I have 
but they are like smoke 
and they pass through my grasp 
then they are just gone."

You know that ideal love that each of us dreams of from childhood? That's you!
Not because you posess all of the ideal characteristics, but because you are a savvy shape shifter.
You have the uncanny ability to detect someone's particular fantasy... and make it you.

You inspire each person to be an idealist and passionate, and you make each moment memorable
Even a simple coffee date with you can be the most romantic moment of someone's life
By giving your date exactly what he or she desires, you quickly become the ideal lover.

Your abilities to make dreams come true is so strong, that you are often the love of many people's lives.
Your ex's (and even people you have simply met or been friends with) long to be yours.
No doubt you are the one others have dreamed of... your biggest challenge is finding *your* dream lover.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>"

"event","When I was growing up I was treated a strange and varied style of life.  My parents ran porn stores and were swingers.  But the things I remember most was music.  It was a constant in my life.  From the hours spent in my sisters room listening to Michael Nesmith sing The Rainmaker, my oldest brother shaking us out of bed with AC/DC blasting at the top of the volume channel, my mom getting pissed at my dad and putting on Harry Nillson's You're breaking my heart, or the continuous playing of Cat Stevens Teaser and the firecat.  Those songs remained ingrained in my mind, those and the several others Kansas Dust in the Wind seemed to be on all the time and weekly I would congregate to the radio for Dr Demento and his radio show of strange and funny songs.  It was this memory that surfaced with great zeal as I heard the first strands of Marvin I love you.  For those of you not in the know I will say simply that this is a very strange and cool song and I will link it here.

<a href=""http://www.geocities.com/jindurnmalak/marvin.mp3""> Marvin, I love you.</a>


Ever had a love of a certain type of cigarettes?  Imagine your beloved Marbs taken away and no longer sold where you live... such an evil thing.  Well I endured this for years as the brand I had grown to call mine was not sold where I had moved to.  Imagine my delight when a trip to the store the other day and a glance across the counter showed those lovely long lost smokes displayed proudly in the rack.  Yay.  I have happily smoked away with a joy that I havent had from smoking in 5 years."

As men we are taught that our self-worth is dependant on the amount we are paid, how we provide, and what we have.  To say may personal self-worth has been taking a beating is an understatement. In June I uprooted my life, left my GF, left my job, tried to reconcile with my ex wife, moved.  Funny thing hope ...you have it and then you wake up and realize that the tangibles are not there.  I was beaten, every time I pushed myself up someone would come along and give me another kick in the teeth.  Depression set in and the suicidal thoughts returned.  Then I found her again,  she has always been there waiting for me, every time I need her.  I have mistreated her in the past ...not been the man I should have been, let her watch as my life blew like a flag in the wind. She offers herself to me, please she asks ...be who you are meant to be.  With her I can be,  I do not have to deny the thoughts in my mind because we are the same.  She calls me her master but it in truth it is I who is beholden to her.  

So many times you have saved my life and asked for so little in return.  Let me spend my life giving back what you have given me.  To my little one I say thank you.  Thank you for showing me the path."

In truth it is the sub who is in control.  With just a few well thought out actions she can turn the doms life inside out, send him scrambling, trying to prove his value and station.  Sometimes I think subs are wickedly sadistic lol.

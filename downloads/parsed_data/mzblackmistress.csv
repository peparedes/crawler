"event","LIFE IS A THEATER!



Invite your audience carefully. Not everyone is healthy enough

to have a front row seatin our lives. There are some people in your

life that need to be loved from a distance. It`s amazing what you can

accomplish when you let go, or at least minimize, your time with

draining, negative, incompatible, not-going-anywhere relationships/friendships!

Observe the relationships around you. Pay attention. Which ones lift and

which ones lean? Which one encourages and which ones discourage? Which

ones are on a path ofgrowth uphill and which ones are going downhill?



When you leave certain people, do you feelbetter or feel worse? Which

ones always have drama or don`t really understand, know orappreciate you?

The more you seek quality, respect, growth, peace of mind, love and truth

around you, the easier it will become for you to decide who gets to sit in

the FRONT ROW and who should be moved to the balcony of your

life. You cannot change the people around you....but you can change the

people you are around!"

"event","Be Y/yourself and remember do your own thing and forget others because at the end of the day you have to deal with Y/yourself. Some just don't understand your views so I say fuck em lol. Everyday Vanillas try to down talk O/our lifestyle in the media and put U/us all in the same category those who practice un safe, non consensual   acts, and act with children etc. If they took time out to pick up a book educate themselves they would know how to underline what is sane and not. Well one day. I am done with My rant I hope it might make those seek out the necessities they need to understand others."

"event","Today  Mistress had a lowly slave groveling at My feet. He was so entertaining. the first thing I told him to remove all your clothing get on your knees and wait with his hands on his thigh until I return. While I was away Mistress was putting on her sexy PVC dress and thigh high black stockings. Then I enter the room with My boots in hand then I place My thigh high boots in his mouth and told him to put them on Me and he said yes Ma'am he zip one boot on at a time. then once he was done I walk to My collar and chain and place the collar on and chain then I realize he was chewing gum I said bitch spit that out then drag him across the room into the kitchen I can hear his knee scuffling on the ground to move fast so he can keep up so he wont disappoint Me then he spit out the gum and said thank you Ma'am. then I W/we walk back into the room and I made him fetch the paper he was a good puppy very entertaining he would bark when I told he good dog for get the paper fast then I had him bark on the telephone to Mistress fire starter boy was We laughing at this puppy dog and his weak bark so I told him to bark louder and he did an excellent bark that he sound exactly what he was a good bitch. I told him that now he must lick and clean My boots shiny now bitch was licking the front of My shoe then I told him to keep going and I said not there here as I was pointing at the bottom of My boots as I spoke on the phone he was doing a ok job on clean My boots so i hung up the phone and grab his head and said keep going your not done because he had looked up as if I said your done now. So he continue to clean and worship Mistress boots once I felt he was doing it to the good I told him it was cbt time lol he didn't ask for this but its about My pleasure I said I know you will do this for Mistress and I said right and he said yes Ma'am but I never did this before but I want to please you I said very good. I walk across the room and open the bag of cloths pins apply one pin to his pathetic sagging balls and then another until they fill all that saggy skin up. Now I know you want to know what happen next I guess you will have to call Me  to find out. <BR>  <a href='http://www.niteflirt.com/calls/PT_interimcall.asp?sid=6456987'><img border=0 src='http://www.niteflirt.com/calls/callimage.asp?sid=6456987&ImageType=1'></a>"

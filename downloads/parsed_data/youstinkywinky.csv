"event","I'm starting to feel. I don't know. I don't know what to say to you, probably because i've got nothing good to say to you. Then again, i wished i could give you some good advise. Good advice that leads you the way right. I pains me to see how much you've changed, how much this world have changed you.
 
I know its unfair to you, your surrounding and everything. I hope you can see it from another man's view, that whatever you're doing right now is ruining you. I hope you're starting to see that.
 
I find it unfair, that man have to be fearful to another. That we're left with no choice but to be afraid. I mean, not that its not good to be afraid but, we're not made to be. We're not suppose to fear mortal. But the we made him fear them. What's the whole point in instilling fear, that if it makes you happy or thrills you, &nbsp;then i'm dumbfounded.
 
I hope one day, one fine day. You'll sit down alone and start realising that what you're doing is nothing but of no use. You're wasting something so precious called time. I hope you start realising what you want. like what you REALLY WANT, and when that time comes, you do it.
 
I didn't have the luxury of someone coming up many times to tell me 'hey, this is not good' 'hey, do that' 'hey don't do this'. I realised them myself, slowly. So i believed that, that would happen to you, eventually. But time, time and time again, you just proved me wrong. You just can't prove to youself that you were capable so that's why i despise you.&nbsp;

Yes,maybe you still can't see. Can't see the whole picture that its sucking you plunging down so fast you don't even have time react and turn back. I'm upset that He has to witness it first hand and honestly all i can say is, it totally tears him apart, into pieces. What else can he do but get you out of trouble every time ? You should start to see that one day, things will get out of hand (Which already is) and there is nothing he can do despite whatever he will try to do.&nbsp;

I just think it isn't fair to Him. Wake up,please."

The real deal,the breakaway,whatever.&nbsp;Scootered almost everywhere around Sengkang. Expressways,parks,forbidden areas(come to that later) and more forbidden areas.</p><p>Scootered to this park then we realised there's so much more to this so we began exploring. Think jurassic park !! Went down this super steep slope to find out there is this gate blocking the way and it states&nbsp;&quot;Under Surveillance&quot; and right behind it was this huge goodass camera staring right at us and no we did no climb over it but but but (wait for it wait for it) we went underneath the bridge aka locked gate. No,it wasn't easy to go underneath,its a sorta shore then river and there was like so many trees and bushes.Guess what we thought we saw...</p><p>Hatched turtle shells !!&nbsp;That was what really made us go underneath. 2 Boys + 2 'Harpoons' *we found them on the floor,long sharp edged wood* and we explored only to realise we got scammed. It was no turtle shells,freakin' empty seashells' K nvm,2 mins after we got scammed,this huge Komodo dragon (monitor lizard la,hahhaahah) swam pass and freaked us all out. Fired the 2 freakin harpoons and we made a run. Scared what,don't tell me you're not afraid,it was pitch black know !! To their advantage all. Tsk.</p><p>We also sorta played with this poor frog in a more or less rough way. Guess we were too rough,it freakin pee-ed from it's ass and hopped away,it was damn hilarious. Never knew frogs could do that. It kind of felt like yknow how lizards drop their tail and escape. Yeah that frog totally had that lizard thing. Maybe it's a lizfro or froliz. Ok stupid hehehe.<br /><br />That was only part one. Anyway we're not bored of whatever. Beats sitting in one corner somewhere and LEPAK right.

"event","Today,i found the determination to write. However,when i logged in,my mind just went blank.
_

Been having weird dreams lately. That day,i dreamt that i went into this exotic pet shop and looked around,there were gators,snakes and really weird creatures,As I walked out of the shop,a lady walked down from a spiral staircase,called out to me and asked if i wanted this for free. & This is a 'Sand Crab'. Its dying that's why she's giving it away. Imagine a vase covered with sand and the crab lives underneath,at the bottom of the vase. It can create a sandstorm out of the sand and when fed,its mouth turns shark-like. It feeds on dry food,like what we feed our dogs.

I'm intrigued by such,at how our brains can come out with something of totally no connections in reality but display such a vivid 'image' in our dreams. Scarily amazing.

So here i am now,stucked at home. Rather,i chose not to go out, i feel as if there's nothing much for me to do. I don't feel excited even though Christmas is drawing,maybe its just today. Started reading today, to prevent my brains from 'rusting'. You know the feeling of doing too much maths or using too much brain 'power' ? Am trying to reach that stage,hopefully. Talked to Ulin yesterday (or was it earlier today) and realised it is this hard to obtain information(problems etc etc) from me,because i hardly tell,even to my own girlfriend. I think its probably the way different people are being brought up. My family wasn't the kind. Just wasn't the kind that speaking up would be comfortable. We don't give or take hugs, love was however in a way,felt. Then again,i don't want my family in the future to be this way,so i'm changing it. I have so much to thank people for,Ulin especially. People who taught me speaking up was okay. By now,if you haven't realise, me speaking to listening is about 1:3 (ratio) 

-
What the fuck have i wrote. Not gona read/check what i wrote. Scary.

Will write again,
YSW is alive,
love."

Prom was awesome,but it was also kind of sad. Its like when this ends,people starts taking different paths. Totally different paths and that,even if one day these paths ever cross again,we probably won't say hi or whatsoever,and that's where its sad,so sad. Probably one of the times i get emotional, hate goodbyes.

Now we're at loggerheads.<br /><br />I want to go out,i want to have money,i want to study,i can't wait for mid's to be over. I'm scared of O's. I'm so stupid, i don't even know meiosis,mitosis and the phases. I don't even know if i need to know this.<br /><br /><p>How ?</p><p>xoxo<br />Mr Potato ( Change the contacts now,reminded )</p>"

Recently,i get drained easily and i don't know why really. Its like everything just sucks the energy of me but at least theres a balance in everything except quarreling.&nbsp;In one way,we always escalate down from there,but we also always pick up from where we fall,that i'm glad. Some of you know,i used to be a person who is very queit,speak to myself alot,write alot,cry alot on the lone end,yeah say the anti - social side. &amp;&nbsp;very often,though its faint,this side of me is still here. I like this side of me actually. I mean,i like its nice. For example,to wait for things to happen when you know it will,you're just waiting for it,to feel people,to read people,just alot of thinking, Its hard to describe but i like it. Through time,you prove yourself right,alot but soemtimes wrong seldom but still do. I'm getting nowhere,i'll stop now.<br /><br />&amp;&nbsp;Chloe,lets adopt the habit of talking to each other more even if we're dead angry with each other,we must be damn thick skin. Must ok. (;<br /><br />Read Balzac And The Little Chinese Seamstress. No comments,just read (:<br /><br />Oh btw,i brought this vibrator tooth brush. Its damn cool,vibrates my teeth.

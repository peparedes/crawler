Anyway, 2 weeks left. Project's not perfect but I'm at a really accepting point right now. I guess I trust that I at least have enough to graduate and right now, graduating is all I care for. Screw being a renowned artist, that can wait! At least until after graduation har har.

Maybe I'll buy my graduation dress tomorrow if the weather's not gray and damp- yuck, April. Went out over the weekend and had some ramen, sushi and a couple shots of sake with my bf and his friend. It was a nice place. Plan to drag my mom there eventually.

Thinking of baking cookies tomorrow. I've got some coconut flakes without purpose. Mmm, coconut flakes...

"event","Wow. So a lot happened since I last wrote. That Tsunami, I definitely did not expect that. Has anyone ever seen that anime, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0? It's depressing. And it sucks that it actually came true.  I'd been keeping track with the news and checked in on a friend of mine in Hawaii since there was a warning out there too. Scary stuff.

I donated 10 bucks to Red Cross' International Relief for the Tsunami victims. If you're too lazy to go to their website, you can <a href=""http://newsroom.redcross.org/2010/05/03/text-redcross-to-90999/"">text REDCROSS to 90999.</a> Didn't work for me because I have MetroPCS and they suck so I went the long route.

<lj-cut text=""Fans concerned for Japan for all the wrong reasons..."">

Anyway, since the disaster, I've realized how misplaced people's concern is. There are SO many people I'm seeing online that once the disaster struck, their first thoughts were, ""OMG what if the creator of this anime/manga/game/this voice actor etc. is dead? It would be the end of anime/manga/this game/this character? Oh no!"" And they're posting all over Twitter and Facebook and where ever going OMG is this person alive? 

Really? Seriously? Okay. I'm human. I love my anime and I was totally concerned with whether long runners like One Piece and Naruto would just cut off. But was I going to go through the trouble of going online to ask about this person? WHAT is the status of my anime?! No. My bf, however, different story. He spent a good few moments over the weekend doing some real in depth research online over who was alive or missing so that he can feel that his anime was safe. *sigh* Love that man, he has his good points, but yeah, his concern? A bit misplaced. FFXIV went down also to help preserve power over there. Sure, it sucks you can't play, but you know what, there are people without homes and people who are buried beneath rubble. Screw games and anime. Japan should not be personified by just that. Watching some of the videos they posted on the news and YouTube, I was about ready to cry. It must have been terrifying. I would never know since there's never been anything like that here in NY, but when watching this one video of a family where the daughter was constantly yelling out for her mother as they ducked on the ground, it really struck a chord in me. And it gets me angry how stupid people are for publicly posting their stupidity online just to find out if this ""famous"" person is alive.

Anyway, enough with the emo rant. Seriously. Donate. I'm broke as hell and I could spare 10 bucks. Think about it. And don't do it for your favorite anime writer or whatever.</lj-cut>

Last few weeks for school. I'm spending my spring break working on my senior project on campus. Sucks but you know what, I can have a million breaks when I graduate. I need all the time I can get on this. Life's okay so far. Nothing to brag about but then again, compared to Japan, I have plenty to be grateful for. And I am. I am grateful. I hope others are too.

"event","I had the scare of my life yesterday. All the work I put into my senior project for the past 8 months or so, give or take, I'd accidentally written over the files on my computer. In an instant, because I was not careful and into the habit of replacing folders rather than individual files - it was gone.

Needless to say I went apeshit. But, rather than going into detail about my apeshit mode, I want to share how I managed to survive it. (And P.S. no worries about the project, I had a back up on a school computer a few weeks old that by chance, no one had deleted yet and so I have to make up a few weeks, but better than months!).

<lj-cut text=""How to successfully cope with life!"">

There's this book I've been told about. ""Slowing down to the Speed of Life"" by Richard Carlson and Joseph Bailey. I haven't read this but someone was nice enough to xerox a particular chapter that I think saved my life.

So to summarize, there are two modes of thinking. Analytical, which is what we use to do like math and solve etc. and free flow, where thoughts will just come to us naturally. I'm still not clear as to the two sides but basically, when you're sitting there going, ""OMG I have a meeting this afternoon and maybe they won't like what I'm presenting and maybe I should have done this different and OMG am I dressed okay for this- I'm so gonna fail!"" etc. you're using the wrong side of the brain to produce thought that isn't resolving or producing results. 

I don't want to write a novel here. Just take these tips to heart next time you're going crazy in your mind about everything:

1) <b>STOP. Is my way of thinking productive right now?</b> E.g. Can I work on paying the bill/tweaking my project/doing this homework/whatever, right now? Will my thinking change the current status of it this minute, this second? Unless you can tend to whatever it is at hand the moment you're thinking of it, put it aside until you can.

Also depending on what it is, like I lost some of my project files last night, after I calmed down, I wrote about what I lost and what I had. And then put it aside. That way when it came time, I can work with what I had and knew what I had to do later without having to spend every waking moment thinking ""Omg what have I lost and what am I gonna do?"" Doing something like that IS productive so it's okay to think about it and once it was on paper, put it away for when you need it.

2) <b>Do I have enough evidence to support my negative thoughts?</b> Do I have the evidence to say that because I overwrote these files, that it is impossible to graduate? Do I have evidence that if I don't do this, this really bad thing will happen - is it a guaranteed, fact? In my case, I didn't know what my options would be until I spoke to my professor and the chairman, as well as talked to the tech managers at school. 

And so. Last night, of course, we're human. My initial reaction was to go nuts. And I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that once I caught myself, I just wiped all worry away just like that book said. Matter of fact, one of the things the book tells you is that you should expect that there will be times that your mind takes over again and it's normal. Just take pride in the times when you're able to catch yourself and divert those ""thought attacks"" they like to call it. So I spent a good two hours in an unpleasant state.

After the two hours were up, I took a shower, had some tea, made that list of what I lost/had, and went to bed, accepting that at this point, crying would solve nothing and until I had all the facts, I can't sit here going crazy.

And that saved me. Luckily some higher force favored me and I recovered my files when I wasn't even looking for them. I hadn't thought about that option at all last night. When I went to school, it took me two hours to pass that computer when I'd already accepted that I'd have to start over, when I went, hmm, I wonder. And then I was rewarded.

<b>When you're not constantly worrying, going frantic looking for your keys or trying to remember that phone number, the free flowing mind kicks in and provides your answers/options that you would be unable to see if you were panicked/stressed.</b> It's no accident that you remember things only when you're not looking for them. If you can't find it, you can't solve it, put it aside and it will all come to you naturally. Decisions can only be made and answers found when you're calm.

And so, I feel like I've reached enlightenment or something. Ooooohm. Ooooohm. Okay, done fooling around. About to apply for an internship I really want and ready to bring this project to the end. If there is a God up there, I just want to say, I love you. Night all.

"event","So. I've been animating my senior project intro (which, again in case you've forgotten or I've never mentioned it, is a RPG like Flash game) since last week on the awesome Cintique. Now I'm sort of tired of animating. And so, feeling unmotivated and not wanting my depression and procrastination to kick in when my review is the week after next, I decided to stop and make something for fun. That's right, I said it, FUN! Play NOW work later. So I wanted to practice making an item shop. It'll be functional but it won't really have any purpose in this case. Just wanted to make it. I wanted to remember that I LIKE Flash haha.

And so, here's a preview! When it's done, I'll post on DA. In the meantime I need awesome pix of sweets and if they're not too crazy, I'll stick them in the item shop.

I plan to make at least one more thing bc I felt like while I'm working on this huge project, I have nothing to show for it yet and since I'm looking for internships now, I need to have some active stuff up there now.

OH! Let me share this deal with fellow tea lovers! 3 BUCKS! Green tea sampler! 3 bucks and NO S&H. I've already ordered mine. Take a look <a href=""http://www.denstea.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=377_386"">(first time customers only)</a>!

"event","So since my mind crash on Monday when I was totally useless, and irate after discovering that I had not only accidentally deleted my script for my senior project, but my old presentations and the documentation from the previous project before I had changed it, it turned out Tuesday and onwards has been the opposite for the most part. I've finally gotten into that mode of just working, working, working, until something aches or I'm too tired to go on. My Happy Music folder on my ipod really helps along with Arizona's green tea w/ ginseng in the morning. I'd forgotten how well that kept me going throughout the day. 

Oh, but first, Valentines Day cookies! This time, <a href=""http://bakeat350.blogspot.com/2010/02/last-minute-valentine-cookies.html"">I went for chocolate!</a> They're gooooood.

I totally made a sad attempt to stage a nice picture and failed. Oh well. And the icing melted. I cannot decorate cookies, not because I can't bc I probably can, it's just waaaay too much time so no thanks. They're very rich and brownie like. I recommend this for chocolate lovers but make sure you've got milk on hand.

Anyway I got to use a Cintique for the first time today! I never want to try digitally animating with a tablet again unless I have no choice! (forgive me, Wocky, and ps, Wocky's my new Intuos4) Animating/drawing on a Cintique was fabulous.

So two weeks and a half till the presentation. I've been a lot calmer about things though. A tip from a counselor of mine this week was, when you're worrying about things, you don't realize that most of the time, your worries aren't even true. Or at least there isn't enough evidence yet to be thinking worse case scenario. Basically, if you're in your car and you have a meeting at one, but all morning you're saying to yourself, OMG OMG I'm gonna mess up, and can I do this, and what if I forget that, it's like you're trying to predict what hasn't happened yet. Basically, her advice was to live in the moment. Unless my worries are productive such as I'm thinking, ""Okay, if I have lunch at this time, then I can have room to do this etc etc etc"" rather than ""OMG I'm not gonna have time to do this! I'm gonna fail!"" then I should busy myself with something so that I'm not tempted to think this way. So far, I've been doing a decent job. I've been working enough since Tuesday that at the end of the day, for the first time since I can't remember if I've ever had this feeling, I feel satisfied enough to go to sleep, and I've also come to terms that if I can't finish - well then I can't finish. I am only human. I'll do what I can.

Oh, learned something new. If you have a really bad toothache, rub ice between the v-shaped area between your forefinger (your Phoenix Wright objection finger) and your thumb, ON the side that your ache is. The nerve passageway apparently connects so it numbs the pain. Saved my father's life today. The man was in so much pain, he couldn't talk and once I told him to try that, then he wouldn't shut up haha. It worked. Just wanted to share with people because I got a bit warm and fuzzy knowing that I made my father so happy. It was like I gave him a miracle cure. XD

Speaking of the end of the day, I'm exhausted. From both animating and scripting, then coming home to bake, set up webhosting/domains. I think it's time to sleep. Night all!</lj-cut>"

"event","So yesterday I was juggling between an uncooperative senior project (in which I discovered that I accidentally deleted my entire script OMFG I was going nuts!) and a side job (not really job, request 'cause I was breaking my head for free) making a form that emailed results with PHP and I totally crashed. Went nuts, migraine, mood swings - the works. By one in the morning, I threw up my white flag and accepted that I couldn't get anything done for the day. I was in fact, being totally useless.

However, one good thing came out of that mess. I've discovered how to make myself do work and feel less miserable doing it. Ready for the miracle cure?

When you feel like you're gonna thrash your room apart, take a few minutes to 1) get some sort of calming tea (chamomile) 2) get up and walk away from your computer (which you get to do when you make tea, two birds in one stone, yay! and 3) Visit the <a href=""http://squee.icanhascheezburger.com/"">Daily Squee</a> and the <a href=""http://failblog.org/"">Fail Blog</a>. If you're not feeling better after this and even two painkillers, then all hope is lost. Go to bed.

Seriously though. Laughing at Fail blog's <a href=""http://engrishfunny.failblog.org/2011/02/03/engrish-funny-of-course-its-long/"">Engrish</a> section was enough to make me feel better. I've also made a folder on my iTunes called ""Happy Music"" for really upbeat silly techno and anime openings. (DRRR plz) And so this morning I've gotten back into my routine of green tea and ginseng (OMG it helps) and I'm actually getting stuff done. Slowly feeling relieved. I can do this, I can do this (repeats mantra).

And so, I wanted to say, thanks Fail blog and Daily Squee. For cute animals, epic fails that make me lol and for my sanity. Renjiluvah, out!"

My tablet finally came in but it's at my friend's house. I have to pick it up tomorrow. Learned some awesome tricks in Digital Painting today. Found out that I CAN fix up brushes nicely in Illustrator. Now I can stop trying to do serious vector art in Flash hur hur, unless I want to. I also feel like I don't suck so much. 

Our first homework, people critiqued and surprisingly no one protested mine. The only critique I had was to tweak the drawing a bit because I drew his foot a bit wonky and to fade out this canvas texture I had added. I was like, OMG do you mean I don't have to envy other people now? Okay, I won't lie. I still envy. This one chick had done this awesome owl from just a light blue background and using the color to block in this bird- like how? HOW do they do that? I'm too linear for that. It's like, if I don't see lines, I'm not sure where to begin, unless I'm using a reference, maybe I could try it. *shrug*

My writing muse has also kicked in and I've come to a wonderful realization yesterday-

I love my light box. <3

I'm not an animation major, but I draw a lot and I'm also not one of those clean lined perfection artists. I'm messy. Very. And I've accepted that that's the way I draw - the end. I draw best when I can make a mess. Problem is, now that I'm in Digital Painting class, I have to scan these messes into the comp and so, they have to be somewhat clean to prevent headache once I get to the painting.

Anyway, lots to get done and I'm determined to do it before anything else mysterious happens to my sick-ridden body. Damn you body! Also, anyone else's room slowly turn into a disaster as the semester wears on? I could swear I cleaned it a few weeks ago... Grr."

Key moments in the day:

Mom: Hey, I bought a tablecloth. The other ones were too immature so I got that one.
Me: Where is it?
Mom: Over there.
Me: *finds a bright neon pink and white cloth* ... Are these... fairies?
Mom: *smirk*
Me: Oh yeah, real mature.

Me: Hey everyone, mommy thinks this tablecloth is really mature. 
Everyone else: LMFAO

Mom: I bought some cups too. They didn't have any other ones.
Me: Are these- baby shower cups? *looks at cups with baby animals*
My bf: It looks like it's for a one year old's bday. Next year, I'm gonna buy you a cake for a one year old just to mess with you.

Me: Fairies. Why the heck did my mother get fairies?
My Best Friend: You know, the fairy kind of looks like you.
Me: Hmm, maybe that's why, except for the eyes. My eyes are a different color.
Both of us: ... 

So we turned that tablecloth inside out, but you can still see it in the pics. Funny. Ah, yeah, so it was good. Had some cake. Ate the last of it today. I think I wanna make next year a tea party too. Fun! And I got new DS games, 9 persons, 9 hours, 9 days and the first Professor Layton. My new tablet, very soon. School starts next week. I've done nothing, but be lazy all day. I'm hoping tomorrow inspiration will strike me, but then again, I've been waiting for that spark for like a week now, no success. A bit worried. And also, I don't care. Which is bad. But once again, don't care right now. Blah.

Anyway, here's to hoping for more bdays and that inspirational spark so I can get some work done before school starts next week. Until next time!</lj-cut>"

Hurray, it's the new year! School's starting, hurray- wait, why am I happy again?

Well, my emo phase aside, I plan to get crackin' on my project tomorrow. Hopefully I can come up with a plan and then execute it all. School starts on the 18th so I want to get it started at least. 

My birthday's this weekend, woot! Having a tea party at my house where I will fake a really bad British accent with friends and family just 'cause I can. Will bake and post pics.

Well since I'm working tomorrow, what shall I do now? Write? Draw? Find a manga to read. Hmm... Not much manga to read these days, especially with all the sites taking them down. Sucks... Anyone see the new Trigun movie yet?"

"event","BEST. MOVIE. EVARRRRRR!

I've been harassing my mother all day since I've seen it a few hours ago, ""I wanna see it again, I wanna see it again!"" I have GOT to see it at least two or three times. I was SO surprised. After seeing The Princess and the Frog and being really disappointed with it and not exactly sure what it was missing that made it feel so empty and then seeing THIS- THIS AWESOMENESS, I'm so glad Disney got it right again. I finally realized what it was about The Princess and the Frog. I know they tried to have magic and fantasy and comedy and their action climaxes and their emotional moment, but I felt none of it. Something about the way they did that movie, I had no care for any of the characters. Matter of fact, I can't remember anyone's names from that movie. I was not attached to anyone and therefore all their moments, without impact and that's aside from their quirky animation moments. 

Seeing Tangled though, it put the kid back into me, I laughed out loud, I clapped, I cried and even smiled without realizing I was smiling, grinning like a fool until I'd catch myself. Saw it with my mom (haha she cried too, best movie ever) and it was the best way to finish my last day of school for the semester and start off my vacation. I absolutely adored that movie and the princess, pink and blond as she is, I thought that I might end up hating her but turns out, I love her. Love her to pieces. She's awesome all the way! If you think she's girly and prissy, you are sadly mistaken and she's armed- with a frying pan!

Woot, finals are over. Baking more cookies next week and spending the time until then at the bf's playing FF14 and Dragon Age. YAY! I'm so relieved and happy right now.

Maybe if the movie's still out by my bday, I'll see it again bwahahahaha! <3"

So I used <a href=""http://bakeat350.blogspot.com/2008/04/taste-of-yellow-yellow-rose-sugar.html"">this recipe</a> for my first home made batch. Turned out pretty well. And I put crystal sugar or those small beaded sprinkles before baking on some because I wanted to save on icing.

And when I got to the icing? Oy. I've discovered that I do not have the patience to make the gorgeous cookies that others do haha. And I didn't wait long enough so the icing spilled over, hence the spillage in the zoomed in pix. And the trees, I put two many layers of icing so even overnight, they hadn't totally dried. So packing 'em started to make them melt. Eek. I already warned the friends receiving, expect pretty sprinkle ones, and some melted. And here is what they looked like before they arrived a melting disaster haha. I hope they get there all right!

I'm baking another batch next week for the family. Will probably re-think my icing strategy. I don't want them to melt again...

Happy Holidays everyone!</lj-cut>"

And so, now she's haunting my brain ever since I left. Gross. And so I must brainwash myself. I'm baking Christmas cookies for some of my lovely friends! And I may eat one every time that nasty lady pops into my head again.

I've been cooking all day with my mother since the morning- have been sort of taking over for the holidays ever since a year ago, the older and less healthy my mother gets, and the more I chip in. And now she's teaching me all her tricks. It's a bit sad because now I feel like we're getting old, but at the same time, I enjoy our bonding. 

And so, stuffing, ground meat for lasagna and trying to defrost that turkey all day until finally seasoning it in the evening drained the heck out of me. But I was determined to try this cookie recipe and so I did. I couldn't <i>possibly</i> go wrong with 4 ingredients- I hoped! And success! Well, sort of.

I couldn't find any good cookie cutters and instead bought this cookie press. I was so excited to try these shapes when the damn dough didn't come out. It was too thick, meant to be cut, not squeezed out. And so, with no rolling pin or cookie cutters, what was a girl to do? I used the barrel from the cookie press and a piece that screwed the plates in and there- my ghetto cutter and pin roll. Hey, better than nothing.

And then I wanted to dip half of the cookies into chocolate only to find that whether I tried to melt them in the microwave or the stove top, it got that icky thick consistency you get when you over melt wafers? Except these were kisses and not wafers and it still did the same thing. And so, I remembered how I make lava cakes and melt the chocolate with butter. So I put in butter and it worked! Smoothed it out. But, something I'd eat sparingly since the sugar content is already a bit on the sweet side. Next time I'm going to use less sugar in the recipe.

And I managed to finish the fic I'd been working on for NaNo, over 50k and still adding some polish. I feel accomplished today despite my back pain and tomorrow will be an equally long day- but the fam's coming and I can't wait to see the look on my sweet tooth uncle when he tries my cookies.

Anyway, I'm off to bed.</lj-cut> 

Have a great holiday everyone!"

Where ELSE can you do that aside from my awesome college, huh, huh, huh? I'll tell ya where, NO where. He just bought this new little football from Modells and comes into our drawing class so happy about it that halfway through class, he sort of shimmies everyone outside and says, ""Let's play!"" And we literally played. A bit embarrassing, but good embarrassment. I haven't played Frisbee since I was like what- 10?

So I'd like to make one of my own and not the Japanese wannabe kawaii big anime eyes kind, but normal dudes, chicks, relateable situations, k thanks. And since I live in Ny I figure what better place to have the game than in NY! I want to be able to have players create a character rather than pick from a pre-set but I don't know if this is yet possible. And I also want to have multiple rooms and jobs that you'll end up in depending on the questions you answer in the beginning of the game before it starts. Sure, it's not important to the game, but I'd like it to feel customizable so players can decide hey, I want blue hair and I want to live in a run down bronx apartment. XD Some mechanics I'm thinking will be similar to Persona because I like the stats and time constraints. 

Anyway, so been refreshing on my AS3 and reading up on variables. I've never really used variables beyond typing in something so I'm wondering how it all works. Gonna have to toy with it but the game already seems like there will be a lot of graphics involved. And so, I'm thinking  maybe I should make all the graphics first, all the scenes, characters, whatever, and THEN throw in the AS3? But then I worry, what if making the graphics first bites me in the ass later?

Anyway, so this is an on my own time project. Just for fun. Real life senior project, NOT treating me good. Gonna <strike>whine</strike> speak with my prof. today and hopefully he can save me or confirm that I am indeed fucked...

"event","<h2>WHO WANTS TO GO TO NEW YORK COMIC-CON/ANIME FEST?! I have two extra tickets!</h2>

Okay guys, so here's the deal. I bought my two tickets online which gave me a receipt and later, wanted to update my order from 2 to 4 tickets. So after the update, the total said 4 and I got a new receipt. And so, I get charged for the first 2 tickets, get 2 in the mail, and now I got 4 more tickets in the mail, and am also getting charged. And so, because their website has mistaken my update as a new order, I have 2 fully paid for tickets that I don't need. So, what do I do? My chances for refund are low, and if I can speak to someone about it, it'll be a huge runaround that I have to do on the day of the convention when I'd rather be running around and having fun. OR I can sell my tickets to 2 ppl that want to go- they're Saturday passes and 40 bucks each. 

<b>I only take PayPal and will email you a copy of my receipt in case it's needed.</b>

So, big run around to either get a refund or fail, or sell? Anyone interested?

Ps: I'd prefer selling them to someone that I am on their F-List or visa versa rather than some total stranger that wants to trap me into some awesome identity theft. Yeah- I'm that paranoid. So, F-list?"

Still planning it out and unsure of what I'm gonna do but I hope it ends up cool. Drawing lots of stuff in my drawing classes so Wed.s are my happy days!

My most recent obsession: BATMAN! I just finished this graphic novel called ""Hush"" and it was awesome. I could've done a little less with the sappy Batman during certain moments with Catwoman but nonetheless, it was bad ass and sexy. Had about all the characters and summarized almost everything you knew about Batman into one book. I enjoyed it. I luff him. I wanna buy a Batman shirt for Comic Con or a shirt that says ""Fangirl"" - hmm, undecided.

Been playing Dragon Age! So far so good! Been neglecting Persona. Gotta get back to that. Senior Project, driving me mad, but I'm slowly getting through. My room's a mess, that's what happens when school starts haha. Well, that's really it for updates. I'm alive and kickin'! And I want... cake?"

And just to leave ppl with something, I wanted to post a link to a video that was on my hard of hearing comm, that I found really offensive, and apparently, so did many others on the comm which was why it was posted.

Basically vanilla cupcakes with colored pieces inside, with vanilla or chocolate frosting. The cake was yellow marble with mostly chocolate frosting.

Haha at first, I drew the H really nicely but then my mother's like, ""No, you have to make it more fancy!"" and then it turned into... that. 

Baking is a lot of work. I'm so tired from baking both of these at the same time and I wonder how bakers do it. Even so, it must be worth the work bc in the end, you get to eat it!

I also almost finished with my friend's Jak Munny. I think I might post it up on the Jak Comm. Painting, it turns out, is good therapy.

<lj-cut text=""To-Do List GO!"">Graphic novel: My first one is over. I never finished the last page but I've moved onto the auto-biographical which is based on a story my father told me about a woman who he believed to have been a witch. Hispanic palette & patterns, late 1950's Brooklyn, lots of trinkets and gadgets to draw in the backgrounds- in theory, sounds like fun but it's a lot of work. I have no idea where to start. So I'm just working on character designs and props.

Senior Project: I'm so lost. -_-;

Electronics: I can finally understand his damn diagrams! It only took me HALF of the damn semester, but now I can actually READ 'em and make circuits USING them! Still one lesson behind though. Oh well.

Everything else class-wise is fine. I need to get crackin' with my graphic novel and this time I may tackle it traditionally rather than digitally. Or a bit of both. Paneling is always my biggest issue and backgrounds, and once I get past that, it gets better. I think I'll be brave and just draw the background first. I can do it! *puffs up chest*

And what's with my obsession with Phoenix Wright- been collecting fanarts like there's no tomorrow. And yet, I've done no homework bc I have no motivation- or correction, I did something but it's not my best effort. Blah. It's 2:20am Renji, GO TO SLEEP!</lj-cut>"

First I had my lazy weekend of finishing Avatar: The Last Airbender, which was friggin' awesome btw, and getting halfway into FF13 which, to my surprise, is also great. I was sort of hesitant for this FF considering all the FF7 references fans were pointing out and creators were mentioning, and while 7 is nice, I like having every FF with it's own identity bc then it just feels cheesy to me, like what they've done with Khs with Days and BBS. Just recycling crap and making more games with recycled crap now. I mean, can we NOT see Sora/Roxas' and Kairi's face like everywhere, k, thanks.

Anyway, so Monday Tim Burton Exhibition at the Moma with best friend and kids, awesome but waaay too crowded. And then Toys R Us to ride the ferris wheel and take pictures and then sleepover! We painted Munnys, baked double chocolate chip cookies and finished the night with KiKi's Delivery Service, also sweet. Then we died for a few hours before waking up the next morning to head out to ChinaTown! Discovered a few new stores, had some sushi, bought useless but cool stuff like my new Renji plush on my mirror, Bleach thermos, Soul Eater necklace and Mario mushroom, *cough* and had some bubble tea.

Lots of entertaining pictures, return home to head right back into the city with my mother for a tea party with a bunch of really great old ladies. Wasn't boring at all. I really enjoyed talking to all these older women despite me being the only young one there to be with my mother haha. Then I felt sick throughout the night due to an odd mix of food but by morning, I had conquered and went BACK to the city to meet up with a buddy of mine, who as usual, walked my wimpy self like 50 Manhattan blocks and almost killed meh! But it was worth the pain. XD *hugs* Ranted about Cosplaying Strippers (Turns out they exist!) amongst other things, had some cheap pizza and went for ice cream later. When I got home, I was done. My cousin was over, successfully distracted me from sleep for about 2 hours until I could resist no more.

So I've awoken from my nap and I feel absolutely terrible. My chest aches for like the 5th day already for unknown reasons, my back, legs and feet throb, and overall I feel icky. But, I have no regrets except that I've gotten absolutely no homework or fanfiction or fanart done. Nada. But I'm so tired. What to do, what to do?

Well, I will attempt work later. If I fall asleep, then I still have a few days until school Monday. I can do it... right? Yes, I must convince myself or I will have succeeded in nothing but pointless but much needed fun over vacation and nothing productive. And even if that is what ends up  being the case, maybe I don't care anymore...</lj-cut>"

"event","So, midterms are this week and next week bc some professors want to make us miserable and do things early... On the bright side, once I manage to survive this- SPRING BREAK!

I can hardly wait. I need a break. 

While school is slaving me away, at least fandoms this week were good to me. Hearing Zuko say, ""Look at me, I'm so pretty, I can walk on my hands woohoo!"" in the Ember Island episode sold me to him a bit. I honestly don't care for the guy but after that- I appreciate his emo-ness for humor's sake. XD Fastfwd to 32 seconds for Zuko's I'M SO PRETTEH!

<lj-embed id=""8""/>

And Gintoki losing his golden balls in the last episode of Gintama had me crying to tears! TEARS! I rewinded and everything. I'll never forget the scene when Semei fixed them but they dropped them back out so they can pit them against one another while Gin chases them around. Poor Gin. I love you even without balls.

<a href=""http://ecokitty.deviantart.com/art/The-Jak-Song-Flash-148518988"">And now there's a Jak song rather than a Cloud song!</a> Weeh! And after I force myself to do this terrible graphic novel homework (which btw, it isn't terrible bc it's a comic, it's terrible bc I'm doing another person's script which is so bad, he should be wiped off the face of the earth for it bc it's so offensive) bc my prof harassed me to treat it as a learning exercise, I shall treat myself to drawing Haji in a Bday hat bc his bday's passed on the comm. Hmm, shall I make it pink? I shall!

Off I go!"

""Search your feelings, boy,"" and she continues to do her Star Wars impression. My father must have seen the series a billion times since I was a kid, now my parents are both nerds.

And I was born from 'em and realized... I'm a nerd too. X3 Although I'm not a Star Wars nerd haha. Ah, I love my mom. And my dad for giving her the -_-; look and going back to his football game.

I'm into the Earth chapter of Avatar (I know, I'm late, leave meh alone) and I absolutely LOVE Sokka. LOVE, I say! The last episode I watched, I rewinded twice bc one of his facial expressions had me laughing for minutes. Bravo for the artists that draw Avatar, Bravo.

Also, got this link from someone and it supposedly ends the love triangle war for FF7 for good bc it's canon material from Square Enix: <a href=""http://thelifestream.net/ffvii-advent-children-complete/6139/this-just-in-the-love-triangle-debate-over/"">CloTi For Life!</a>

Sure, it's a backwards robe but- IT'S STREET FIGHTER! Find me a normal blanket with SF, and I'd buy it, just so happens, Snuggie got to it first. I WANTED AN AKATSUKI ONE but those went flying off the shelves first at FYE bc suddenly there are Naruto fans in the middle of the Bronx in the ghetto... who knew? And I'm so angry bc my bf's two friends got to the last two so I had to settle for SF and every time I see 'em, they tease me and I give 'em the finger. SCREW YOU, MAN! XD You can't buy these online either so it's either you find 'em in a store or too bad. Oh wellz. I'm happy with Ryu and Ken. *hugs*

And it's the day after my Bday and I'm in lazy mode. My roof's still a mess and the city will most likely come in to fix it and charge my bastard of a Landlord bc he was supposed to comply by a certain date and hasn't...surprise. We bought an air mattress for me to sleep on and we're taking it out of the rent. HAH! Anywayz, now I'm eating chocolate cherry cupcakes that I baked from yesterday and feeling... okay, I guess.

I was mean this morning with my lack of sleep but I'm really trying my best to stop being so... emo. I'm tired of being emo. I want to be happy. And jumpy and energetic and even if the universe is against me, I need to somehow appreciate the small things. Like:

Street Fighter Snuggies
Itachi Thermos'
Bleach T-Shirts
Renji Keychains
Howl's Moving Castle on DVD (OMG FINALLY WOOT)
A haircut (Gosh I can't wait to hack off this mop on my head)
Pocky & pork buns from ChinaTown
Chocolate Cherry Cupcakes
FANFICTION!
My favorite new shirt with oranges that have faces attacking the orange juice maker! FOOD WITH FACES!
Phoenix Wright Justice for All & Trials & Tribulations
TEA!
GREAT CLASSES THIS COMING SEMESTER!
GREAT online friends! (And bc some of my rl ones suck. Hmm, maybe we should all get sucked into the technological age and just all have our interactions with a screen between us?)

Ah, what would I do without fandom? I'd def be more depressed. And I have a small job starting this new semester in two weeks so I'm already looking up things I want to buy. <h3>Like SHIRUKEN EARRINGS? SHIRUKEN! ON MY EARS! MUST HAVE IT!</h3>

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/renjiluvah/pic/0003e63d/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/renjiluvah/pic/0003e63d/s320x240"" width=""240"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

And I will get it first paycheck MWAHAHAHAHAHA! Imagine if I were a real ninja, just pull one off my ear and chuck it at someone! OMG that would be so great! 

Ahem, anyway, so trying to be optimistic. Trying to get more sleep despite being on my floor but at least tea keeps me somewhat healthy. Ah. I'm 25! And I feel...20? Yay! Fun! And I sound 10! I will never grow up! *grabs her Kakashi pillowcase and begins running around her apartment like a madwoman*

SO- NEW YEAR'S REVOLUTION! ENJOY THE SMALL THINGS! AND WHEN PPL SUCK, MAKE YOURSELF HAPPY! :3 Because selfish is the new in thing."

<h2>I f'n LOVE programming!</h2>

Of course, when it gives me problems, I curse, fist my keyboard, distract myself online. But finally, today I was in Web Design and since my prof isn't known for being very helpful, I had to help myself and so I did. After completing my plans for my final due in two weeks and helping a friend on the side with his project, I felt like a GENIUS! Ah, it's so great to feel like a genius. I'm happy.

I did my drawing homework yesterday and am excited to get started on working on my drawing final a bit early later since I did so much web work in class, saving me more time to do other work at home. It makes me happy when I know I can go home and either go nothing- or do work bc it's OPTIONAL at that time bc it's early. Ahhhhh. =3=

Oh, and new obsession! STREET FIGHTER! I'm going to have loads of fun drawing them for the first time. Any requests for characters? I'm thinking I'll start with the mascot Ryu, then Alex or Vega. Hmm. O_o

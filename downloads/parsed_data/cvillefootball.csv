"event","So i figured i better update because i'm getting yelled at. Lets see not to much have been going on, bowling has been going good, we are going to win the state championship and no i'm not cocky i'm just confident. Over the weekend lets see, friday i went and watched my dad bowl. Saturday i had my bowling league in the morning then that night i went to hooter's with maples, jeff, lee, pat, scott jones, chris welsh, and danielle. Then sunday i went to this bowling fundrasier for this girl you got in to some sort of accident with a lawn mower and needs a second operation on her eye but doesn't have the money so my aunt and uncle set up this fundraiser, it was very fun it was a 9 pin no tap tourney, i couldn't bowl with the guys so i was in the kids division with my cousins that bowl for south lyon, i won plain and simple i killed them. Then on the way home from the fundraiser my dad, brother in-law, and i ended up going to hooter again.  That is about it


have you ever regretted something you said?
have you ever cried for someone who would never cry for you?
have you ever felt too complacent?
have you ever wanted something that you knew you couldn't have?
have you ever taken for granted the important things in life?
have you ever wished you could go back in time and change it?
have you ever loved someone who could care less?
have you ever laughed so hard you cried?

After school i had bowling practice, except not really practice it was study table which was boring.  Then right after study table i went out to dinner with my mom and little sister to pizza hut, very good.  After dinner i sat and did nothing for like 3 hours. Then i just wasn't feeling to good about myself so i just had to get out of the house so i went bowling with maples, pat, jeff, and scott at like 10 tonight. after that i decided to make this and that is about it.

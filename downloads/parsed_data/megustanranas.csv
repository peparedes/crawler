Okay, here's how it goes: if you are eighteen, you need to have a big fat ""Voting day"" written on your planner for Tuesday.  And, here is my political influence from this newspaper I got at church today.  Although it is a Christian newspaper, it these statistics or whatever you want to call them are completely neutral.  

Ummm p.s. these numbers are all jacked up and that is my fault because sometimes I can be real dumb and blonde... so go by the issue, not the number... okay?  Okay.

Const. Amendment 1: That whole Rockaway Beach thing--""If you vote yes on this amendment, you are voring to change the Missouri Constituion to allow a casino to be built in Rockaway Beach.  If you vote no on Amend. 1, you are voting to keep casinos limited to locations on the Missisppi and Missouri Rivers.""  Me personally, I don't know what to think on this one... anyone have an opinion?

Amendment 2: ""If you vote no on Amend. 2, you are voting to allow homosexual marriages.  If you vote yes, the amendment will be added to the Missouri Constitution and will allow marriages only between one man and one woman.""  Guys, this is so important.  Basically, God designed marriage, so He defines it as well, which is why he created a woman instead of another man after Adam.  That is God's definition.  I'm not a gay-basher or anything, but the issue here is the sanctity of marriage, which I think we should keep God's way because he made it!!

Amend. 3: ""This act toughens a number of the Missouri statues on sexual offenses and assault on law enforecement officers; it provides for the payment of restitution for criminal offenses.  It specifically increases the punishment for child pornography, and furnishing pornographic materials to minors amoung others as well as places more restrictions on convicted sexual offenders.""  Um... sounds like a good idea to me... I really don't want to get raped, so if this prevents someone from doing that to me or someone else, awesome!! 

Amend 4: ""This act prohibits locationg adult cabaret or sexually-oriented billboards within one mile of a state highway.  No explicit/implicit pictures or designs will be allowed.""  Um... again sounds good.  I don't like seeing naked people on the highway...

Amend. 5: ""Bill vetoed by Governor that attempted to address the loss of doctors in Missouri due to high malpractice insurance rates.  It tried to limit where lawesuits could be filed as well as how much could be awarded for what is called 'pain and suffering' or 'noneconomic damages'.  ""  I dunno what to think about this one either... any help? 

Amend 6: ""THis vote was to include the Boy Scouts among the many organizations allowed to have special automobile license plates.""  Um, I think it's not going to hurt me.. .why not? 

Okay, in closing, I just want to say that it is your duty to vote your Christian values and morals at the polls.  Yeah, one guy may not promise as good of taxes or education or whatever, but if he/she supports Christian morals and values, I believe that you should follow that.  

Thank you, and good night."

So.. What is going on with Justin and me?  It feels so wierd, almost like he isn't my boyfriend.  And why after four years is he finally okoay with the idea of marriage?  I'm so ready for a committment!  I dunno what to think.  All I know is that I want him to come home... yeah right.  When is that happening again?!  Um, October.  And then he is planning on being gone for FOUR months this summer and it will be over our FIVE YEAR anniversary.  Yeah.  That sucks.  God, I so need to rely on you through all this though.  I can't change him or this situation on my own and it's so hard for me not to be in control, but God I just need help to be humble and let you take care of it all.  Lord I love you so much."

"event","HEY!!

I'm back everyone!!    What an awesome, awesome trip we had.  It was a long day, everyday, but it was soo wonderful.  We started everyday working at the church they are building and I learned how to put up insulation (did that several days) and also how to mud or spackel.  I'm pretty proud of the work we all did, and we were able to help our missionary out a lot by doing some of that work.  In the nightime, we still had services and evangelizing, as always, and that was amazing as well.  Through the week, God gave our group the opportunity to lead 506 people to Christ.  That's a lot of people.

However, it was pretty scary at night time as well.  One of the first nights, Sarah and I walked around with two guys from Blue Ridge Baptist Temple inviting people to our service and eventually it was getting late and we needed to get back.  We walked past this store and this girl comes running out going ""SARAH!""  It was Mary-Cruz, who we met TWO YEARS AGO.  She recognized Sarah and we chatted a minute then left.  We walked down the road and realized we were totally lost, and I started FREAKING OUT because these boys started yelling at us girls, saying BAD stuff to us in English AND Spanish--- I was FREAKING OUT!!!  So, I was like, let's go back to Mary-Cruz and have her tell us how to get to the park where our group was--especially since it was starting to get really dark outside.  Mary sent her little sister with us on the way, and we finally made it back safely.

The thing is, earlier that afternoon, I had my Bible study and I was praying that God would keep us safe that night and it is no coincidence in my mind that Mary recognized Sarah, after not seeing her for two years, right at the moment of being unsafe and completely lost.  God is awesome.

Saturday night was also a little scary, because that Friday night someone had gotten shot and killed in the street in the neighborhood we were in, and then there were all these drunk guys in the street and stuff... oh well.  We are safe now.  I think that if my mom knew about half the dangerous situations I have been in down there before, there would be no more missions trips for Jen!! 

It was such a good trip though.  I had been praying a lot for God to just use me and refresh my Spanish down there, and he really did.  I sometimes have a pride issue down there, like ""Oh this is my forty-millionth missions trip and I've taken twelve-hundred years of spanish and I've done this and this and this"" but this year I totally gave it over to God and let Him work through me, which is what I should have done every other year.  

I'd love to say more, but this is so much already... maybe I'll write more about the trip tomorrow or something.  I gotta finish my laundry then go to work!  I'll talk to you all later!"

"event","Here I am in the Cornell College computer lab supposed to be working on....um... oh yes, KID'S COUNTRY LESSON PLANS that are due completely done on, oh yes SATURDAY.  Right.  Sooooo yeah I guess I'll get started on that here in a second or two, but first, here's about my Chicago experience:

We left at 7 AM.  Not woke up then, LEFT.  So, a little tired, okay... got lost trying to find Justin's friend's house that we were just saying hi to, then they told us literally thousands of wonderful things we could do that day and here's how to get there and here's more instructions and more directions  AGH! Left me a little stressed, but I got over it quickly.  We got pizza, but not the real Chicago pizza.  Hmmmm.  Then we drove to this train station to catch a train to downtown Chicago where everything is, from the suggestion of Justin's friend.  Okay cool, got on... a couple stops later this lady and a guy and their kid get on three rows ahead of us.  The seats are designed where you can flip them facing forwards or backwards on this train.  So the people that sat one row in front of us wanted to flip the seat in front of them so they could put their feet on it--pretty darn harmless.  However, the lady, guy and kid who were in the seat ahead of them were also sitting facing wierd and then their kid was sitting in the seat, facing his parents (who were faced backwards direction of the train moving).  The people in front of us switched their seat backwards and in doing that accidentally pinched the kids fingers in between the seats.  They were like, OMG i'm so sorry, blah blah, but no, this mom went off.  She was like, 'eff you and you effing this and that' and on and on and they were like we're sorry, it was a total accident and this mom is all like well sorry doesn't make my kid feel better.  

So the kid cries for like 1 minute, because it's not that big of a deal.  But this mom is still really mad.  She's like 'well, you all better not be sitting their when I get off this effin bus because I'm going to punch you in the effin face' and on and on.  At this point I'm like OMG We are going to witness a murder here on this Chicago train.  The dad is all trying to calm down the mom and she's like, 'i'm not scared of the effin police blah blah' .  Okay so finally it's her stop off and the dad gets up before they stop and then a minute later the mom gets up with her son and she's standing right next to them in the aisle.  She says, ""okay who wants to feel the pain my son felt (meaning the guy or his wife)"" on and on and they're like, it was an accident we're sorry (what else can they do?!?) on and on... finally she just like, leaves with out punching anyone.  Anyways, the point of this story is that it was scary, or at least I was scared, and it's really kinda funny to look back on.  Hello lady?!  Chill out!  I mean, we almost witnessed a pretty good fight on this train to Chicago!!  Ha ha...

Okay, so we finally get off the train and we walk a whole freaking lot.  No joke, at least a good 20-30 blocks.  We saw some cool stuff, then were ready to eat again after the train ride and walking and it was like 5 pm or so.  We go to the Cheesecake Factory which was so incredibly awesome.  I put on a skirt and some make up in the bathroom to be extra cute.    Our waiter was most definitely gay, so I kinda flirted with him, not really, but he was super cool.  I had chicken madrela or something like that and then chocolate silk and satin cheesecake which was HEAVEN.  Unfortunately, they didn't have pumpkin cheesecake (ha ha erin and stace) but oh well.  We weren't going to make it back in time for our train at 640, so we went to Borders and read (I read the Friend's book for the ten years remembered or whatever).  We decided to take a cab back to the station because it was forever away (and getting a little dark).  That was FUNN!!!!  Jus is like, 'quickest way to union station!' and boy did we go.  It was just like Mexico... sigh.  So much fun just racing around downtown.  Anyway, we take the train back, no one got killed this time, or almost killed and then we started back to Iowa and got in about 1 am this morning.  Wow.  We were TIRED.  Remember we left at like 7 am that morning.

So anyway, that was me and justin's four year anniversary and it was such an awesome day.  Hope you read all that, if not, oh well, i don't like you either!    Gotta do my work now.  bye!"

I've been sick with almost anything under the sun, felt like crap, so I haven't wanted to do anything that really really needs to be done, aka studying, cleaning, etc.  I'm worrying about stuff, fought with Justin about RIDICULOUS things... needless to say, I've been the biggest grouch lately.

Now I don't want this to sound arrogant, boastful, or prideful, so when you read this, know that this is how I mean to be.

But, lately I have been feeling like in the problems some of my friends have been having, it seems like they can't see what's going on, but I feel like I see what's going on, and because of myself or maybe Justin going through that same or maybe a similar situation, I feel like I have the answer, solution, or at least the knowing of which way they need to be pointed in.  Does that make sense?  Well, here's the deal:  I just don't know what to do!  I don't want to be all like, ""well, I think I know what you need to do"" or maybe it really is something that they need to figure out on their own, but maybe they need a push or something?

I'm just feeling like what I need to tell some of my friends are things that they won't want to accept.  But I feel like if they don't fix their problem, it will cause so many more later on in life...You know, I'm not going to be scared of what they think now.  But I just don't know what to do.

What do you all think?  Should I tell everyone what I think is going on, even with the potential of pain?  I just want to be completely honest... and so if you want me to be honest with you, let me know.  Again, I don't at all want to sound ""know-it-all"" or anything like that... this is just a pattern i've been noticing with a couple of my friends"

I don't really like the counseling feel, but at the same time....... I guess I really need this.  It's really interesting too, because I guess Justin is being affected by this a whole lot more than I thought and than I ever wanted.  Anyways, we were thinking that maybe one of the reasons we have to ""wait so long to get married"" or whatever is that we have to work out this crap as much as possible.  I don't want this to affect my future marriage with Justin.  These are some freaking deep issues though, and if anything, we need to work through them for my sake.  Yesterday I was thinking about how it would be so embarrasing if someday that I would just start bawling in front of my kids or something because of a stupid little insignificant comment from my dad.  Then it goes into the whole thing of how my kids are only going to have one grandpa (as of now) and that has to be my dad, who is so crappy to me... ya know??  I dunno.  Maybe Julie is going to get remarried before Justin and I do... well for the first time of course.  SIGH!

I said, either it's going to be you changing your ridiculous standards for the amount of time you have to spend with me, or we are going to have a relationship like you and Ben.  I was crying last night, and it shouldn't have to take me crying to realize things, you know?  Like it shouldn't take me crying for us to get an extra day to spend together.  I don't want it to be the way Jus has it with Ben.  I want him to realize that he can ""spend time with me"" by emailing one day simply saying ""hi"", or calling me when he can, which he does do.  But the things that really need to stop is just things like him finding it impossible to have one day for us to spend together and that I just ""HAVE to realize that he's busy and that he has to work.""

It's his turn to HAVE to realize that I've changed myself for four years now, and either he's going to need to change his thinking a little bit, or we are going to have to have a relationship like his and ben's.  I know that Cornell is a completely different school.  I KNOW that he has to work, and I'm really glad that is the choice he has made for his Spring Break.  B

But why was it soo hard for me to get him to take one day for us, and then I cry about it and I'm even scared to ask him for another day and THEN we get another day?  It seems entirely and excessively extreme conditions for me to get some time into his schedule that isn't somewhat ""planned.""

I dunno if that all made sense.  I'm not mad.  I'm just feeling very very emotionally drained..."

"event","Live Journal is kinda boring sometimes.  And I think I'm getting sick... my throat is really sore.  Please no God!!!  Hopefully this will be a productive weekend as far as studying goes, but I have a feeling it won't be.  Oh well, good thing I kinda started already.  I'm just going home for spring break and working, I'm pretty sure, but I'm going home to see Justin and I don't think that he wants to spend much time together.  He says he'll be busy working the whole time.  I need to work too, but since it is a break, I don't want to be doing that everyday, all day long.  I just want him to see things my way.  I don't understand his way either, just the fact that he seems so set on things and that things could never be another way, like that we won't get to hang out much b/c he'll be working the whole time?  Why the heck can you not put the effort into reserving some time or even, dare I say it, making some time to spend with me?  I mean, don't you want to see me?  Don't you like coming home b/c you will get to see me??  Don't just be like, well, I""m going to be working so I dunno how much time we will get to spend with each other.  Instead you could say things like, hey I have to work and I know you do too, but I really want to hang out with you... maybe we can go get dinner one night or something... or hey, you should come home that next weekend after your spring break so that we can hang out a little bit before I have to leave.  Why am I seriously NOT a part of your life??  Why am I just there until someday you will want to be married... this someday being thirty-something when you have all this stuff accomplished that you can't do after we get married?  Why do you not trust that God has a divine time for us to get married, and why do you deny that?  What is it that makes you think that you have to get this stuff done and then God will say let's get married?  What would you even do if God said let's get married in the middle of some of your great plans?  Would you ignore Him completely, until you have all the stuff ""right"" and ""you are your own person and have found yourself completely?""  Or would you trust in Him?

Would you and will you trust in Him?"

"event","Well, Live Journal kinda stresses me out b/c it erases your messages sometimes.  Anyways, about this summer, I'm not worrying about it anymore b/c I've given it to God.  And whatever He wants me to do, even if it is working at the bank this summer, I will do it.  It might not be that bad though.  Maybe God will let me get transferred to another branch.  That would be an ideal situation, because in reality, I really need to pay back my parents the money they lent me this year.  Working at the bank will help me do that.  Easily, actually.  Anyways, I'm going to just leave it up to God.

Yay for Jen and Jus and our happy conversation yesterday that I'm still smiling about!  I love you so much sweetheart!!"

I'm thinking about being a counselor at one of the Youth Front Camps this summer.  I'd get $150/ week, which is about $50 less than I'm used to getting, but if this is what God wants me to do, i'm all for this.  I just need prayer to help me figure this out and for God provide for me financially.

Please pray for me!! :)"

Okay I'm thinking about being a counselor at a Youth Front camp (Circle C or L Bar C, but I guess they have different names now or something).  So... I dunno.  You get $150/ week, which would be $50 less per week than I'm used to, but I dunno. This sounds really cool and I dunno.  Does God want me to do this?  Jennifer wants to do this!

Lemme know what you think... Lauren, since no one else reads this actually.  That's kinda sad.  :)"

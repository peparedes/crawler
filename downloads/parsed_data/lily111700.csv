"event","Alright well it's been a couple years. Basically to sum up the past 3 years.. I continued to restrict, and eventually hit 130 which was my lowest weight and even though that doesn't sound that bad, I looked like a skeleton and had basically no fat on me. I ended up losing a total of 50 lbs in one year an it was incredibly hard to maintain.

Once my boyfriend went to college I began to gain weight because I didn't have that constant distraction to keep me from food. I also caused him to develop an eating disorder and he was alot skinnier than me to begin with so his weight loss was more noticable. 

Eventually I started to eat normal, exhausted from efforts to maintain my rituals of running 4-7 miles a day and barely eating anything. Needless to say my metabolism was absolutley shot and running that much was just to maintain my weight at 130...

Gained basically Almost all of my weight back when I started to enjoy my life but I can't be like this anymore. Restricting is all I know and I want the bones back. I want it all back so bad and I don't care if I'll be dizzy and tired and sleeping nonstop and killing my body with All the running..

People treat you nicer when your skinny and pretty and that's the facts. Everyone knows it. It's subconcious.

I want it back and that's why I'm back on here. Determined to hit atleast 130 by prom... I need to be skinny for college. I'm even considering not getting a meal plan for college. My mom would be fine with it... She knows I have food issues. She used to moniter me and all that fun arguing crying stuff that comes along with torturing your body for one goal... 

Hope"

I dont really feel too great because im sick so i dont really want to eat. If i eat any more though.. im gonna be very upset. im trying this new technique.. like i already knew about it but im just eating breakfast and lunch from now on.. that way, by the time i get home i will have hopefully burned it off through school and field hockey. I have to lose weight though! for some weird reason, my weight has sky rocketed and i really just dont understand why.. i havent been doing anything different. but i used to weigh 152 now im 162? and i was fasting and drinking TONS AND TONS of tea and water. i dont understand how i can go up 10 pounds when i wasnt really eating that much before.. geesh, i need some advice on this</p>"

7 crackers with a little bit of cottage cheese

Idk.. I didnt do so well.

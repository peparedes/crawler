I received Becky's letter today, and I almost cried! I adore her. I will send her one back ASAP.

This does mean a lot to me, though, if/when you do read this, Becks (you even get a special nickname now XP)...maybe we can both sort of start anew together after years of failed friendships we have both gone through. If only you didn't live on the fucking west coast. We could hang around Manch and do absolutely NOTHING. (Thus constituting a perfect day for the two of us!)

Creative writing - ""capturing emotion"" poetry assignment hot pencil thingy

<i>My mind's a mess. I don't want to worry about homework or taking out the trash or anything else right now. I don't want people talking to me, either. I just want to see if my best friend is home, and then I want to fall asleep listening to some Bjork. That would be nice. Her amazing voice always manages to soothe me, sometimes even when I'm feeling like this. What would soothe me even more is to hear the sound of my best friend chattering away to me about the crazy events of her day, because, the truth is, my obsesion with her - my Lauren - far outweighs my obsession with Bjork. (That's pretty big.) I speedily punch in her number, knowing that the chances of her picking up are slim, especially since she'll want to get online soon - it's almost 8:30. (She has dial-up connection.) In spite of knowing this, my heart grows heavy when I hear the answering machine pick up. I try a few more times, but with no luck - it rang more than three times on the third try, which means that someone is using the Internet. Tears begin to well up in my eyes. There was a time when she'd call me everyday if something like this should happen. No, I can't be thinking like this. She grows irritated with me when I do, and really, who can blame her? But now that the tears have started to fall, I can't stop them, and not even Bjork can cheer me up. I remove my glasses and my clothing, slip into a fresh pair of boxers and a tank top, curl up in a fetal position with my comforter pulled high over my body upon my bed - a lame attempt at consoling myself. Suddenly, I remember a sticker I received from some stupid assembly thing earlier today at school. I take my shirt that I had been wearing, peel the sticker off and slap it on the wall, for no apparent reason except to mark the moment in some tangible form.

It's been there ever since.

Now, boxes fill up my room and my mom's happy chatter about the new place we're to move to follows me everywhere. I know I should remove thes ticker fromt he wall, but lingering sentiments always manage to sneak their way in and prevent me from doing so. The truth is, I'd like to keep it there forever, but who wants to stare at a stupid ""Elect Howard Dean"" promotion sticker? How could I describe its significance to somebody without sounding like a complete loon - and really, when would I get the chance to? Should I leave it there, the future owner of my bedroom will see it, pry it off, can it and never think twice about it. Such is the meaning of my emotions - valid and important to me at a moment, disposable at another. Such is the poetry of my life: feel, materialize, reminisce and destroy. It seems the only one who remembers is myself.</i>

Don't mock its suckiness. We have to do a poetry unit, and over the past year, I've grown to despise poetry. Bleh. Only another semester, and then I'm out of here. My writing has been taking a major downfall this year.</lj-cut>

Fucking hell. I was eating food and this greasy whore comes over and sits with me and...I don't really know why. She was sitting at a table across from me and then spontaneously decided to come over and...sit with me. I had to...<i>smell</i> her. And I don't know what she was trying to do by this - in her pork-fried brain she probably thought this made her cool - but she pulled out a Barbie-pink Gameboy, all the while glancing up at me while putting in games. I was trying not to say something bitchy or mean to her, but god fucking damn it - I don't know you, I don't want to know you, get the fuck away from me before you drip fucking grease out of your hair and into my food and I have to go crazy and mutilate you and then get myself arrested for something that wasn't even worth it and only temporarily made me feel better. o_o Bleh. She made this pitiful expression when, after scoffing down my food as fast as I could so I could get out of there faster, I got up to throw my garbage away and proceeded to leave the lunch room...the creepy fuck's gaze never left me. Stupid smelly skank, BE GONE

DON'T YOU LOVE HOW NICE I AM? And I wonder why I have no friends :P But seriously...I don't want to see - or smell - that shit when I'm eating my food. She looked like a sped, anyway, so maybe she just didn't know any better. Meh. I'm done bitching now."

It almost makes me want to hole up in my room without emerging for a month playing video games nonstop just so I can be weak and docile again. =P At swim practice yesterday, I was clocked again, and now I'm at 49 seconds - one of the fastest on my team, and now there's a far more noticeable difference in my back and arm muscles - my leg ones, too; if I'm tensing up my calves, they feel like rocks, and when I don't, they're still pretty firm to the touch. This is so weird. This is like...the first time ever I've ever been in any kind of peak physical shape. :P I'm pretty proud of myself.

We have to do this dialogue thingy for creative writing, so I decided that my hapless resource room teacher is to be my muse for the rest of the year, so my dialogue is between her and a block of Canadian swiss cheese. Whee. The best part is that I'm getting an A in that class, and all of my essays have been equally pointless. It's the best. Hooray for stupidity earning good grades! Women's Literature is and always will suck and will never be a good kind of stupid, though. Bah. Stupid uber-feminists.

So I already said in an earlier entry once how I like to draw random shit on the chalk board, because the teacher doesn't mind (and actually likes them sometimes)...but today since we had an assembly it was mod B first, but I didn't realize that, so I came in and started drawing and these kids were like ""So YOU'RE the one who does those drawings on the board!"" and they were all laughing over them. Now why can't that be my class? Nobody laughs at them in my class :P Oh well. That is all."

The storyline was great, the characters were engaging, the graphics were amazing and the whole thing was just...whee. And they actually made Tidus and Yuna romantically involved in an un-annoying way. (That's almost impossible to do in anything.) And yes, I realize that by making these statements, I have forever sealed my fate of dorkdom, but I don't care. I want the Japanese version of FFX, just so I can hear what the characters sound like in another language :P That's going on my Christmas wishlist, yep.

Oh yeah, historical event - I get muscles. I've been flexing my arms and back muscles all weekend to my mom and driving her crazy. ""MOM! LOOK WHAT SWIMMING'S DONE! I'M ACTUALLY *gasp* PHYSICALLY FIT!"" Whoohoo. It's kind of hard, and I probably won't make it to our first swim meet, but it's fun, and it gets easier with each practice. Meets start December 7th...hopefully I'll be a faster swimmer by then...right now I can do a freehand at 100 yards at 59 seconds, but I guess that's ok because two other people got around that, too, and the fastest was at 54. Blah. I'm glad I did this. I look so...athletic in my swim gear. I should be getting prescription goggles within a week or so, too.

"event","Once upon a time, there lived a goat. A giant, angry blueberry flew down from the skies, marched up to the goat and swallowed it whole. Then, a tapdancing kiwi went up to the blueberry, kicked it in the shin, and proceeded to feed its offspring with it. The kiwis grew very strong and very large, and as soon as they reached dinosaur size, they marched into Albania and destroyed everything. They thought they had conquered the world, until bin Laden came down, plopped down upon them and ate his cherry pie. ""Oi! This pie be damn good!"" exclaimed the infamous terrorist and retired gay porn star. He felt something squishy beneath him, so he reached down to pick his rump when angry bits of disparaged kiwis blew him to pieces. Then the world fell apart, except for Albania, which floated in outer space, until an angry mob of Hungarian wilderbeasts flew up to it and..uh...ate it.

The moral of this story is that Jen is hot. The end."

The first day was nice, disregarding the fact that I was stuck behind this really slow guy who couldn't even do the fucking crawl stroke correctly, and he'd stop in the middle of the fucking pool to say hi to his friends in a different lane. o_o I wanted to lodge flippers up his ass at painful angles. Yep. I think something must've happened between him and the coach because he didn't show up yesterday. Most of the swimmers there are freshmen and sophomores who all know each other so socially I'm separated from them, but I saw Kara (or was it Tara...? Nicole, help me o.o) who used to sit with me, Nicole and another kid Ian during lunch my freshman year, so...uh...whee.

I'll be sad when I defeat Final Fantasy X. I love this game. It completely overrules my Tomb Raider fandom. I used a friend sphere to move Yuna over to Lulu's magical sphere thingy, so I taught her a bunch of Lulu's spells so now she's a double mage. I bet my Yuna could kick your Yuna's ass. Yep. This game is ridiculously easy, though. The only parts (so far) that really challenged me were the third cloister of trials and the stupid ""wyrm"" thingy. They could've made Seymour at least <i>mildly</i> difficult to kill...though I hear he's harder the last two times around, which I haven't gotten to...maybe it's just me, though, because Matt's been playing it for a while and he found it really difficult.
I'll stop babbling about my dumb video game now. For those who have no idea what I'm talking about, just uh...pretend you're enlightened.

I don't really want to, but she's paying me to do it, and she's offering to pay for any supplies I need to do it so of course I'm doing it. (Heh, I need a job.) The only problem is, I don't know or remember the names of anything, so basically my list of needed supplies looks like this:

Wedding picture (:P)
HB art pencil thingies
Smudgy tooly papery thingy
Big easel-y (but <i>not</i> easel-y...I have no fucking idea what it's called and I don't know how to describe it) sketchy thingy
Squishy-bendy eraser thingy
Honey eraser (the only thing I remember :P)

So uhh..yeah. She should have fun with that list *cough*.
I'm so god damn bored during the week now. o_o All I do is sit at home watching the Science Channel all day and drawing random objects in the household. (I drew the cover of my <i>Ever After</i> tape the other day which I WOULD scan if I had a fucking computer to scan it onto.) Thanks to my boredom, I now know how radio waves in the '70s unearthed energy waves in outer space which is proof of the big bang theory or something similar to it, how an AIDS vaccination is underway and should be expected within the next ten years (and why some women are immune to it), how and why the box jellyfish is one of the most deadly sea creatures in the world, the birth of astronomy and how it goes hand-in-hand with astrology, and other fun things. YAY SCIENCE o.o Actually, because I'm a dork, I find it interesting, I just feel really stupid sitting there all day watching the fucking Science Channel. I could be doing something *gasp* productive, afterall. (Because, you know, wasting the afternoon on neopets.com is SO much more enlightening and enthralling than the amazing cycle of polar bear hibernation.)

Uhh..I actually DID do stuff on Tuesday, because we had the day off. I went up to Aly's house. Aly's pretty boring though. Her brother's better. :P He's more amusing. We watched ""Finding Nemo"" (which was a pretty good movie, but I liked ""Ice Age"" better) and he...uh...sat on me. (And he weighs 200+ lbs.) That was interesting. I almost lost feeling in my legs, but that's A-OK! Later on we had girl-slap competitions. He's a better girl-slapper than I am. That makes me sad. :(

My mom's being a whore about the computer. She keeps talking about getting it fixed but I'm pretty positive it was the fan breaking down that caused the computer to overheat (because what else could explain why the computer was so hot when I touched it, why it smelled afterwards, and why for a while before it died it made this weird grinding noise?), and if I'm right, then the computer isn't salvageable, and WE NEED A FUCKING NEW ONE. But no, stupid whore's always right. Blah.

Anyway, the mod is about to end, and I'm stupid, so the end."

Today I go driving down East Industrial Park Lane, a road that has little to no traffic at all so it's perfect for practicing. I'm actually quite proud of myself with this. I'm better than I thought I would be...although I don't know if I'm in any position to say that. :P But anyway...yeah. Spend a day driving with me and see for yourself. (I actually don't cause the United States of America to fall to its ruin! You'd be AMAZED) I also cleaned off the computer area (my mom said that once I did she'd be ""more inclined"" to buy us that scanner...so I did), so hopefully we'll also get that today. I sure hope so anyway. >.>

Well uh..yeah. I'm going to eat food, and then I'm going to do stuff, and then I'm going to drive, and (maybe) I'll have something more interesting to share tomorrow.

First swim meet starts in two weeks and one day! (I need to get back into shape so I joined my school's swim team :P It's really the only physical exercise that doesn't drive me insane, and I did it a lot as a kid so it's not like I suck at it, so what the hell. XP)"

"event","I'm only now realizing how much it sucks that my discman was stolen. I have a new one. It's red (<i>too</i> red). It comes with a radio and a remote control thingy. Now why does one need a remote control thingy for a discman? Hrm. :| The remote control thingy is annoying and gets in the way. You attach the headphones (that don't have a headband and are VERY annoying as they get tangled very easily) to the RC which you attach to a cord that you plug into the discman. If you don't add the RC, the headphones are way too short and you need to carry the discman close to your chest in order to make them comfortable to wear. But the RC is heavy and pulls the headphones down unless you clip it onto something, which I hate. I don't want a stupid remote control. :| It makes me nostalgic for my previous discman. However, I do like the built-in radio, even though I don't receive too many stations. At least I get Cool 96.5 and WZID. Yay for radios.

It seems I'm not the only one who's had things stolen from, however. News of late is that there's a bunch of thieves around the school this year, and they also got my mom's friend's son, Jordan. Jordan's a freshman this year, and he's into playing soccer. The other day when he came out to get his bag after practice, he couldn't find it. He did find it later on: in the middle of the hall, dumped out, with none of his things inside of it. He had a bunch of brand new soccer equipment in his backpack, very expensive. They still haven't tracked down the person who stole it, and Jordan's been having to use his old, crappy soccer equipment during practice. That pisses me off a lot because I know Jordan. He's not a bad kid. I really hate people sometimes.

Actually, me and Laura are just tag-alongs because it was originally just Nicole and her friend who were going. It's going to be ADULT FREE, even though Nicole and I are technically adults. It BOGGLES THE MIND!...Um...yeah. My discman was stolen yesterday. That sucks. I'm just glad my t.A.T.u CD (my birthday present from Lauren) wasn't in it. I almost brought it that day. I'm going to buy a new one probably Sunday or Monday, but if my t.A.T.u CD was in it, I'dve had to stalk down the thief and wring his fucking neck. Whoo.
I can't believe how much Laura and I are alike. (I'm loud and anti-Harry Potter, though.)

In my Creative Writing class, we have this thing called ""Vocabulous."" We're each assigned a word, and we have to come up with three fake definitions and the real definition, then we have to bring it in on a specific day and write the word and the four definitions on the board. If you're a classmate and you guess the right definition (or know the word already), you get an extra point. If you're the person with the vocab word and your fake definitions were so good that no one got the correct one, you move ahead two points. I'm in the lead right now with the most points, alongside some other girl. I rawk da vokab like woah. Fear me. I'm going to own this class by the end of the semester. Just you watch.

I hafta listen to her a bit more. And although the lead singer sounds like a smurf on speed, I really, really like Judy & Mary the more I listen to their songs that she put on my CDs. I love listening to songs in Japanese for some reason. o.o Actually, I love listening to songs in any foreign language...it just sounds better and more fluid than english...it's kind of odd. Oh well.
Speaking of Japanese bands, Cibo Matto owns me. (I discovered them from an episode of <i>Buffy</i> and am now hooked. XP) The end."

One by one they march
Filled with ant-like splendor
With their shiny exoskeletons
And their feeling feelers
And their spindly limbs
<b>ANT MASSACRE!</b>
Tiny ant souls armed for battle
Bitches bustin' caps in yo anty behind
Flying through the air by force of fire
Goozing ant guts splattering on the window
OWNED!
Dis side of the ant hill be MINE, homie
Don't be triflin' me now.
Spindly ant limbs tickle the face of another
Chompy chompers chomping with vicious glee
Because my mother never loved me.

"event","Ok, I'm calm now. Since I do actually care about the person I bitched and ranted about in my previous entry, for the sake of her feelings (and no I am not talking about Bobish), I will refer to her as Little Miss Nancy.
So Little Miss Nancy says ""thunderstorms r gay"" and I go ""no dere kewlz stfu u suK"" and then she says ""cumptrz r lYYyyYF!!1"" and I go ""NO STFU FUK U DIE OMG WTF"" and she goes ""U RETARD OMG I H8 U KTHXBYE *BLOKKKK*"" and leaves. (Have fun making sense of that. It makes about as much sense as our whole pointless feud.)
So like...I left Little Miss Nancy a friendly little message in my journal as an unnecessary, elaborate me-way of saying ""FUCK YOU TOO, LITTLE MISS FUCKING NANCY."" THEN, Little Miss Nancy left two self-pitying anonymous replies in my journal (fair enough for her, I suppose, for she lacks in LJ-ness), I responded to them in said journal entry with an edit, and then, just to hurt her, I changed my name on MSN to ""Useless diatribe is strangely satisfying."" (I knew she'd be smart enough to figure out I was talking about her.) So Little Miss Nancy tells me to ""eat dogshit you freak"" in her MSN name. I curtly respond with a snippet from an Alanis Morissette song, ""Fabulous freak of nature"" (which it continues to be until I can think of something else). That wasn't really intended to hurt the feelings of poor Little Miss Nancy, that was more of a spit-in-your-face kinda thing, a way to show that I didn't care.
Then - and this is why I make a terrible bitch - my sense of remorse kicked in. I felt all....bad for Little Miss Nancy. All my death threats and voodoo dolls, I realized, were made in vain. So I cast them aside and I unblocked her. Being that she's a lot like me, I was aware of her thinking, and gave her about a day or so (or less) to confront me again. My predictions were right, and now Little Miss Nancy and I are quite the pair of peachy friends again. So that was my life for the past few days. The end.

Oh yeah, I had lemon meringue pie today. It was...good. o.o"

You know what I'm sick of?

Those who think that theirs is the word of righteousness in a feeble attempt to make themselves look powerful. You don't know everything, you are not a deity or an enlightened being, you are babyish and pathetic. You'd get along great with Adolf Hitler should he be living in our generation.

There are pigeons.
PIGEONS.
Outside on the ledge next to my apartment.
Fuck man, pigeons are the shit.
They always come around in the mid-late evening, around 6 PM or so, and they just hang out and shit and squabble and mate...they remind me a lot of humans, except they don't talk and they take on the form of birds. Pigeons are cool.
And they're, like...all in different colors and appearances. You've got one that's your standard pigeon, then you've got, like, goth pigeon off to the side with black and dark red feathers with a tinge of white on its back so it sort of looks like it's wearing a trench coat. Then you've got the loner pigeon. No one likes it. It's white with gray blotches and it's probably the coolest pigeon I've ever seen. Then you've got another one very similar to the white and gray pigeon except it's black and white. Entirely black and white. Its wings are covered with black feathers except for the tips which are white, and its head and neck are white with black blotches. Whenever the loner pigeon gets attacked, this one always rushes to its side and they fly off somewhere safe together. (I know this because whenever I look outside of my window, there they are at the roof of the apartment, perching side by side.) They be tight homies. And all of the other pigeons just sit there and clean themselves and act all tuff and hawt to get chicks. Yeaaaaaaaaaah they know their stuff.

And then...there's me.

I go a little bit too far just to get their damn attention. I almost licked the window the other day just so the white-and-black one would notice me. It's funny because I like to pull down the shades and peep through the blinds while I bang on the window lightly and watch them stare at my hand while their heads are cocked to the side. Another time I was smacking my chest and making retard noises and the pigeon with gray blotches just stared directly at me while I did it for about 5 minutes. I finally bust out laughing and it flew away.
I am so mean.

I wish I was a pigeon.
I wish I could be harassed by me.
That would be...really cool.

I don't know why, and it's kind of ironic, really, since I originally started this journal with the intent of making it merely a source of self-amusement, while I kept my emotional state and personal life separate at my <a href=""http://shatter.blurty.com"">blurty</a>, which I haven't updated since the day I created this journal.
I used to always change journals because of some newer, better server coming along, and I found something to hate and bitch about every single one...LJ, DJ, uJ, all of 'em...and here I am, back at the very first one I turned away from. I don't know why I didn't just continue updating <lj user=retromonkey>, my old LJ (and my very first e-journal ever)...I guess I just wanted a fresh start.
But I love this thing. I love my LJ. And although I'm not a frequent commenter on some of you people's journals (some people I comment to more than others...I admit...it doesn't mean I don't read, I just don't really know what to say to some people and/or entries...=X), I love my friends page. It's almost always being updated, and there's a perfect balance...some people are constantly posting amusing things and others are posting emotionally driven things...it creates an equilibrium that I like. Because I can be both serious and humorous (although to be humorous is more fun).

Damn it, listen to me and my drivel here.

Ok, so this isn't scary ranting Becca as I've calmed down a bit now. Plus I'm tired.
But I wanted to continue this.
My stupid evil homo-gay fascist teacher doesn't deserve all the blame for my being on the verge of tears. He just furthered it. I've been worked up for a while lately. Personal turmoil with <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~spandex_wombat"">Lauren</a> mostly, and feelings of worthlessness. I think I'm starting to become all depressed and angsty again :\. Except I won't bore you with that shit. Maybe I'll type up a private entry about it later. Private entries rock me.
I never realized how much this Garbage CD (<i>Version 2.0</i>) perfectly describes my life in a nutshell. Every single song on this CD I can relate to. ""Temptation Waits,"" ""I Think I'm Paranoid,"" ""Wicked Ways,"" ""Dumb,"" ""You Look So Fine,"" ""Medication"" and ""The Trick is to Keep Breathing"" all perfectly describe me. The rest do as well, but not as much as these songs. And that's like...almost all of the songs right there, lol. This CD is perfect. (And Shirley Manson is a goddess.)
Today to ease my mind a bit after school let out I took a long walk for about an hour. I listened to <i>Version 2.0</i> twice in a row. I walked all over the city, surprised I didn't get lost. What's kind of ironic and almost symbolic was that I reached my front door right when the song ""You Look So Fine"" (the final song on the CD) came to an end. I need a new one, this one's kinda skip-y, scratched up and old.
I cried and lip-synched along to the CD as I walked, and I probably looked a little retarded to those who saw me, but I didn't even think of that until after I was home and cooling off.

I miss <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~spandex_wombat"">Lauren</a>. I want to hear her voice. But she is in Connecticut for a few days and cannot call me. I wanted to cry and vent on the phone and pretend that she was there hugging me and that I had her shoulder to cry on. And of course all of my snuggly-comfort friends are the ones I only know online. This sucks. I need a life in the worst way.
I need sleep. But I want to see if <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~spandex_wombat"">Lauren</a> is able to get online from her grandparents' house tonight. She logged off last night against my wishes and left me sitting before the computer crying. (Once again, I am in dire need of a life.) Even though we weren't necessarily in the peachiest of moods, it's a little comforting to at least know she's there and with me in some form. And when she's gone it's like...I have nothing to cling to except for a fantasy.
I need love right now.
Somebody love me. Give me love. Anyone. Please. I need physical contact, I need hugs and snuggles and things. I need it in the worst way. I don't need sex or fake compliments/white lies. I just need to be held by someone, anyone.
...Yeah.
I'm going now."

<font size=1>(you've been warned)</font></center>
I felt like crying during summer school today. I hate my fucking teacher. Fuck him and his opinions. He seemed intelligent when I first met him, and even though we have differing opinions I still respected that.
However, I cannot respect anyone who believes that the state and the church should not have been separated.

...Can I articulate this in a calm and diplomatic manner without putting my foot in my mouth?
Can I get the upper hand, can I prove my point without sounding like your typical rambling atheist, can I prove that I'm right and he's wrong?
Can I extend my spoken vocabulary <b>beyond</b> twenty-five words and actually sound intelligent?

Of course not.

I'm so sick of this. Why is it that I have such a hard time defending myself under times like these? He's so unbelievably fucking wrong and everyone in my class agrees with him. Everytime I opened my mouth I only made people mumble that I should ""just shut up."" I sat there at my desk for the last half hour of class fuming and wanting to burst into tears. It's not just this time that I can't get my say in without explaining myself properly. It's everytime. Every single time I ever have a differing opinion, the other person automatically gets the upper hand because I can't stand my own ground for jack fucking shit.

Only this time, I wanted more than ever to have the upper hand, because he's JUST SO WRONG! The last time the church and the state went hand-in-hand, witches were burned at the stake and biased court hearings went awry! If the church and the state goes hand in hand, what will happen to civil rights? To homosexuals? To African Americans? What will happen to those who don't believe in God? What happens when the White House becomes completely overrun by overzealous bible-belt cretins? He says that if the church and the government unite, this country's morale will be bolstered. <b><font size=3>YEAH FUCKING RIGHT.</font></b> What kind of ""morale"" did we have before? Fucking hell, Ku Klux Klan members were practically overriding almost the entire US government!
And who the fuck can say that the belief in God will ""bolster morale?"" If anything I've learned from my experience, it's that it does the direct opposite. Marilyn Manson describes it well in his autobiography. He explains that Christianity teaches people to ignore their basic human instincts to fit into this Americanized idea of the ""perfect life,"" and that that only causes more emotional and physical strain, and I agree with him.

Ok, shit. I need to think things through a little bit more. I'll post another entry later."

"event","This idiot in my summer school class thinks that by eliminating drug use, he's living a healthier life. Alas, he pays no attention to what he eats, he smokes like a chimney everytime I see him outside of school and, to my knowledge, he once said that he continuously gets drunk on weekends. BUT, he doesn't do drugs. When I brought this to his attention, his response was this: ""But I'm FAR healthier now!""
I actually think that cigarettes alone are worse than abusing drugs. They do their damage more slowly. They take years and years and years to weave their destruction and by the time you finally make the move to quit (or not), it's too late. Smoking-related deaths are by far some of the most slow, gruesome and torturous deaths, in my opinion. Few are able to evade such consequences, but the vast majority of smokers don't.
Beh.
And now I sound like your typical straight-edge fanatic, people who I have little patience for. But I will continue with my argument anyway, should I be put to shame by it or not. It's what I feel, and I've been meaning to make an entry about this for a while now.
I hear a lot of drug users and/or abusers complain about the majority of ""straight-edgers"", but I find it a little unfair how they dismiss us all as ""squares"" or ""raised by government propaganda"". True, many people are too crazy about it. I admit that. I also admit that a lot of America's ""war against drugs"" is pretty flawed and one-sided. A lot of anti-drug folks take their message a little too far. However, I as someone who won't even touch a caffeinated beverage feel a little cheated and angered when someone tells me that because I won't pick up a drink or smoke a bong means I ""don't know how to have fun"" and/or acts as if I'm trying to be some sort of a parental figure to them. I'm not. I have friends who smoke weed, even a few that occasionally do a line or shoot up. Do I hold it against them? Do I try and shove it down their throats the drugs-are-bad, you're-going-to-become-addicts and you're-fucking-up-your-lives bullshit? No. The few that I do happen to know know the meaning of the words ""moderation"" and ""control"" - something most drug users don't, and no one, not even drug users themselves, can deny that - and are actually quite intelligent. It all just comes off to me like whiny rebellious preteens all hot and bitter because heaven forbid they don't always get their way, especially in dangerous situations. So what are they going to do to prove their so-called points? Destroy their bodies and their lives? Ok, I know that came off as biased, and I'm also aware that it kind of contradicts what I was saying before. But what I mean is this: most of the drug users I have met are actually not drug users but drug <b>ab</b>users. (Yes, to all the fanatical ""sXe kids"" reading this right now, there <b>is</b> a difference.) They do them because their friends think it's cool and their mommies tell them no. Sometimes I think they should shut up and listen to those horrible horrible straight-edge kids they all seem to feel so inclined to bash. Maybe they might actually *gasp* LEARN something. (Although I think that may be too much for a few burnt-out braincells to handle.) And by no way am I speaking of all the drug users in the world in these statements, but of all the drug users whom <i>I myself</i> have come across through my own experiences.

That is my drug rant.

And now for my anti-drug rant, to explain why I'm also against the ever-overzealous straight-edge kid.

Ok. It's great that you're a vegan in tip-top shape with high morals and a sense of right and wrong. It's great that you feel you have a direction and purpose in life. That's all fine, dandy and respectable. But did you ever stop and think that maybe the honor roll student sitting next to you occasionally does a line? Because someone uses drugs does not mean that they ABUSE them, nor does it make them the typical slack-jawed, runny-nosed, emaciated bag of bones you were taught to believe that all drug users are. Some of the most open-minded and intellectual people you will ever have the chance to meet, in my opinion and in the opinion of many others, are, or were, drug users. That's not to say that if you go out and smoke crack and snort a few lines you'll be exalted to a higher plane of existence and ultimate enlightenment. If you believe that, then you're just stupid. Mostly it'll just give your brain a nice fry. However, to dismiss something outside of your morals and values without reading between the lines is even stupider than using drugs with such expectations, and makes you just as stupid as the strung-out dope fiend blind to the truth around him/her. Point blank, what I'm trying to say is that if you place yourself above the man standing next to you morally simply because he's smoking a cigarette/cigar or a bong and you're not, <b>YOU'RE AN IDIOT.</b> First of all, you're inhaling his second-hand carcinogens which is scientifically proven to be more dangerous than the smoke itself, so you're just as fucked as he is, and secondly, a bum on a street could have never touched a bottle of whisky or a pack of Marlbro's in his lifetime while Mr. High-life walks down the street and throws said bum a coin while puffing blissfully away on his expensive Cuban cigar, so does that make the bum above Mr. High-life? To denounce a person's judgment and worth simply by his/her personal activities is pretty flawed, and no doubt it's people like you that gives being straight-edge such a bad rep.

I have more to say, but I'm sick of typing. Maybe I'll edit this entry later on, or make a ""Becca's Drug Rant pt. 2"" instead. Heh."

"event","Damn it. I have nothing to write about, but I keep wanting to update this thing.
Well...I did pretty good on my geography test. I was pretty surprised to realize that I do still have that knack for it that I had back in 6th and 7th grade, that I thought I had lost. I was pretty proud of myself. I didn't get a perfect score because I didn't take down the right notes and missed a few places I needed to know, but I was surprised at how much I knew on my own without studying. Maybe I am still a smartass afterall? O.o
We also started watching <i>Malcolm X</i> today. We're only less than an hour into it so far. My judgment based upon what I have seen is good. I like it. I like the way they show his childhood juxtaposed with his adult life. And of course, as with most war movies and <i>The Pianist</i>, the injustice towards the African Americans has a pretty powerful effect on me. (What can I say, it's my soft spot. I'm still trying to decide if it's a gift or a fault.)
Anyway.
Because I have nothing better to do, I'm taking yet another survey-ish thingy, this time stolen from <lj user=xunchainedx>.

<lj-cut text=Chii?>
30 Things You May (Or May Not) Know About Me:
1. I taught myself how to read by the time I was two. 
2. I knew how to read before I could talk. 
3. When speaking I tend to stammer, but I can read out loud clearly and with ease.
4. I was singing before I was talking.
5. In spite of my bout with depression, and my suicidal thoughts, deep down inside I really don't want to die, and I'm terrified by the idea of being in pain for a long period of time.
6. I'm afraid of <i>everything</i>.
7. Despite what I typed in #5, I refuse to take medication for headaches and menstrual cramps, unless it's interfering with what needs to be done, such as sleeping or focusing in school.
8. I cut myself for a while, but whenever I did I'd start crying and automatically begin to staunch and tend to my self-inflicted wound.
9. <b>No</b> amount of convincing will get me to pick up a Harry Potter book. Never mind the movies.
10. <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~spandex_wombat"">Bobish</a> is my best friend. Nothing will change that, even if it means forfeiting my own happiness.
11. An IQ test I was made to take when I was 6 years old said that I was intellectually advanced but emotionally behind in relation to my peers.
12. I took another one at age 10 that said I was gifted.
13. I think the IQ tests lied.
14. No one has a sense of humor quite like mine.
15. Edgar Allan Poe is my favorite poet.
16. ""The Raven"" is my favorite poem. I can connect with it. I understand it.
17. Anya Seton is my favorite writer.
18. ""Green Darkness"" (Anya Seton), ""White Oleander"" (Janet Fitch) and ""The Stand"" (Stephen King) are my favorite books.
19. I think the reason that Stephen King appeals to such a large audience is not in his eccentric storylines or the genre his books fall in (though that's definitely part of it), it's the way he writes his characters and the relationships between them. It makes us root for them and cry for them; it makes us feel for them and love them, as if they were real. I think he's a genius and deserves the popularity he receives.
20. I learn and understand things better through literature and fiction than through any other form of learning, albeit symbolism and visual demonstrations.
21. I am double-jointed in my fingers (especially my thumbs) and ears.
22. <i>The Exorcist</i> and <i>Requiem for a Dream</i> are my favorite movies. <i>The Pianist</i> has potential for being one as well, but I need to see it again. I didn't pay enough attention to it the first time I saw it due to a lack of sleep.
23. I didn't stop playing with Barbies until I was 13.
24. <lj user=donslice> could quite possibly my evil male clone. Upon talking to him the past few days, we share nearly identical (but some things vary) interests.
25. I've been friends with <a href=""http://nicole_strange.blurty.com"">Nicole</a> through school longer than anybody else.
26. I'm supposedly 5'9"", but I feel shorter.
27. Gatorade is my favorite beverage. Especially the grape-flavored kind.
28. I am addicted to dill pickles. Seriously. Everytime I go grocery shopping I get a gallon of pickles, and I go through that jar in under a week. Pickles own me.
29. When I was a young toddler (around 1-1/2 to 2 years old), if I didn't get my way, I'd throw a fit and beat myself up.
30. <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~spandex_wombat"">Bobish</a> is a hero. She saved my life."

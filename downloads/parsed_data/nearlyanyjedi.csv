<b>Word #1:</b> Cognizant.  

I use it as just a fancy way to say ""aware.""  And who doesn't like to be fancy?

<b>Sample sentence:</b>  ""Ugh, people getting on the bus need to be cognizant of their backpacks instead of hitting me in the face with them.""

<b>How much the word irritates my spouse, on a ten point scale:</b>  Very low.  No visible eye rolls or head shakes when this one is used. 0/10

<b>Word #2:</b> Inflammatory.  

This word is great because you can accuse other people of being inflammatory if you dislike what they're saying. Thus you can refuse to engage with the statement without acknowledging its truth.

<b>Sample sentence:</b> ""Your description of me forgetting where Starbucks is located was needlessly inflammatory.""

<b>How much the word irritates my spouse:</b>  Relatively low.  1/10

<b>Word #3:</b> Dreadful.  

This word appeals because it conveys such a flat dismissal, especially when applied to a person or entire worldview.  Extremely powerful due to its utter negativity.

<b>Sample sentence:</b> ""Your new girlfriend is dreadful."" (Ouch, right?!  That's why it's such a great word!)

<b>How much the word irritates my spouse:</b> Was described as being a word my mom would use.  10/10"

But I hope there is a time in my life that I am not too busy to find out the answer.

Have you looked at the questions and answers under the heading ""[Case X] v. [Case Y]"" in the collected student questions and answers from previous classes?  I think they should clear things up for you, but let me know if you're still uncertain.""

My response: What a spectacularly helpful response, delivered the day before the exam. Have you noticed that you're a huge prick and no one respects you?  I think that should clear up why people refuse to engage with your class and complain about you to the dean, but let me know if you're still uncertain, and I'll try to make the message more explicit."

"event","I was in the coffee aisle at Target, because they have on offer the makings of the sweet manna from heaven which is Dunkin Donuts coffee.  I don't know what precisely is the quality that makes DD coffee so delicious, but I know it is only partly attributable to the fact that each sip is usually followed by a big tasty mouthful of Vanilla Kreme (tm).  Because here I am making it in my own kitchen, no donuts around, and I'm still doing that ""aaaahh"" mouth-smack thing.

What baffled me was a package of Starbucks-style ""to go"" cups and lids, proudly emblazoned with the logo of Archer Farms, Target's grocery line.  They were sold in packages of 6 or so, for around $3.  I'm not talking about a bulk package of styrofoam cups, such as would be used at a staff meeting or to be otherwise stacked next to a coffee urn.  These were just a few faux-coffee shop type cups to be used once and then thrown away.  That advertise Target.  ???

First of all, if you're making your own coffee before heading out, good for you, this is a frugal choice and shows good morning-time management.  But have you considered taking it to the next level and drinking the coffee out of a mug?  I believe you could actually buy a regular coffee mug for $3, which can be used a virtually unlimited number of times.  

I know that at first blush it may seem tricky to take a mug on the road, but believe it or not they actually make travel mugs for just such a purpose.

It wasn't even as though these were whimsically designed coffee cups, for Target moms to feel like they're expressing their personal style with their beverage toting fashion choices.  These were strictly functional.  Just for the hole in customers' hearts that can only be filled up by paying too much for boring crap that exists to be thrown away.  Lovely."

"event","When Z and I went to New York, we tended to tromp around until we were super starving, and then struggle to find a food source.  One afternoon we happened upon a bagel place.  My turn in line came, and seeing that they also had a sandwich menu, I was struck with creative inspiration: Could, I asked, he make me a sandwich <i>on a bagel</i>?  

""...YEAH,"" he responded.

Then I realized that the entire deli was premised of the idea of sandwiches-on-bagels.  At least I'll never see that guy again.

------

Another time, we were catching a movie at Collins Road in CR, and Z asked me if I wanted popcorn.   Hmm, hmm, do I want popcorn?  How big are the buckets, I just want a regular helping of popcorn, I don't want to be eating popcorn forever.  I'll just pop over to the counter and ask the girl how big a medium popcorn is.

Just as the girl stepped up to me and I opened my mouth I noticed that they had a display of empty popcorn buckets.  Being a quick thinker, I adapted my question to fit this new information.

Indicating the buckets, I said <b>""Is the one in the middle the medium?""</b>

That one just hung in the air for awhile, the girl and me staring wordlessly at each other, both in disbelief at the question I just asked.

------

But I think I finally topped myself in the car with Z yesterday.  The car in front of us was sporting this on the back: 

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v718/nearlyanyjedi/pie_logo_index.gif"" border=""0"" alt=""without words though""></a>

I grunted, ""What is that.""

""That's the Pentagon expenditure.""

""No Zach, what is the <i>thing</i> on it.""

""That sticker there?  I think it shows the Pentagon expenditure.""

Yes folks, at first I thought that the ""Pentagon Expenditure"" was the make and model of the car."

"event","Now that Operation: Future Employment Get has come to a successful close, I would like to share some helpful hints for legal interviewers.

#1 - Do Not Give Me Alcohol if You Are Not Also Giving Me Food - This is so obvious.

#2 - There is Only So Much I Want to Hear About You - Wow, you did a federal clerkship, huh?  Now you're telling me your theory of why you've been so successful.  I wonder how you made partner...?  Phew, you're telling me, I didn't even have to ask!  It sounds like you would be a great fit for this firm!  Oh right, you already work here.  You're supposed to be interviewing me.  I'm the one who wants a job.  Maybe we should wear nametags to keep this straight.

#3 - At Least Pretend Like You've Prepared for This Interview - I realize you have to give up 20 or 30 minutes of billable time to meet with me, and I also realize that the recruiting coordinator probably strongarmed you into meeting with a fellow Iowan.  But when you start firing random questions at me about law review (Tip: I am not on law review) or answering open-ended questions with one word answers, I can tell that you don't give a shit.  So congratulations, you just wasted both of our time.

#4 - Don't Act Like I'm Not Good Enough For Your Firm - Because we both know that I am.  Okay?  I don't know if you're trying to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Method"">neg me</a> or what but it's just embarrassing when you act like a law degree from Iowa is somehow suspect when compared to one from Stumblefuck University around the corner.  I hate to sound like I'm really feeling myself, but seriously when your top client is a local municipality, you should be trying to sell me on you, not vice versa.

#5 - Please Maintain Usual Social/Personal Boundaries - When we are eating lunch, and you are a male attorney, there is no reason to touch my napkin.  Or my jacket.  Or my purse, jeez!! Touching a lady's handbag is like one step away from honking her tatter."

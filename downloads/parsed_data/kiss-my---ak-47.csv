"event","sometimes, i dont know why I get so angry with you.

right now all i can think is that you are a hypocrite.

you tell me to quit smoking, and you're smoking now.
you tell me that you're beliefs are the reason.
but now your beliefs have changed.

you think we should enjoy life more.
and theres too much stress.
and thats because of ""rules of religion""

i disagree.
society has placed those rules.
make more money.
live a lavish lifestyle.

that leads to stress.
not religion.

i think i liked you because of your beliefs and how strongly you felt about them.
i admired you.
it takes a strong person to announce their beliefs proudly.
and that was you.
was.

smoking pot.
drinking.
smoking.
denouncing your faith.

honestly, im just disappointed.

youre not what i thought you were.


I cant be with you now."

"event","<font size=""1"" color=""#ff6633"">This past week has been pretty insane.<br />I really don't know why, but I'm thankful for the decent weather that we've had...<br />aside from the hail storm.<br />Thursday was awesome.<br />Kyle put my subs in my car &amp; we went to the underoath show.<br />Kandace,&nbsp; Joey &amp; I had to wait in line for an hour &amp; there was about 40 kids<br />that had beaten us down there we figured we'd be first in line - but whatever.<br /><br />We met up with Ben, Matt, Tiffany &amp; her little brother &amp; his friends.<br />We had a blast...we pretty much made it up front &amp; honestly - I<br />can say that I have never been that sweaty in my life. It was disgusting, but well worth it.<br /><br />I can't remember the name of the first band...<br />but the lead singer was talking about how he hadn't been feeling well<br />I laughed and looked at Kandace and said ""Maybe it's because your pants are too tight, sweetheart.""<br />We died laughing &amp; then he made a comment about having a beer gut &amp; painted on jeans...<br />nothing was better than that.<br /><br />His band was alright - but his guitarist was freaking GORGEOUS.<br /><br />Then Maylene &amp; the sons of disaster played...A-FUCKING-MAZING.<br />Dallas is such a beautiful man, too bad he's weird on stage.<br /><br />Then it was Norma Jean - I had never seen them live until this point.<br />They put on such a great show.<br />Kandace was singing along &amp; I was just trying to stand still to soak in the moment.<br /><br />There were so many guys around us, it was hard to keep our place &amp; everyone else had left us because it was too<br />much for them to handle. So Kandace &amp; I kicked ass and took names &amp; somehow ended up closer than what we were.<br /><br />and then...UNDEROATH.<br /><br />after seeing them play, I knew that I could die at that moment a happy girl.<br />we stayed in the crowd for 4 or 5 songs and we just looked at each other and knew we had to get out.<br />By that point, people were getting a little too violent &amp; we were dying of heat stroke.<br /><br />So, we got out &amp; walked around.<br />We went upstairs &amp; got matching shirts <br />and left.<br /><br />I'm so glad that we parked where we did...<br />we pretty much got out instantly &amp; we parked remotely close.<br /><br />At this time, we were all dying of thirst and i only had 40 minutes before I had to be NPO.<br />So we sped to the closest gas station and got 64 oz. cokes.<br />I dropped the love birds off back at Joey's and drove home attempting to annihilate that monster of a coke...by midnight i had it 3/4 gone and I was ready to puke. <br /><br />I laid in bed the second I got home and I couldn't sleep.<br />I knew that in 12 hours I was going to have my mouth hacked open<br />and I was going to be in pain for the entire weekend.<br /><br />So, Friday 12:30 my mom called and woke me up to tell me to get ready...she was coming to get me.<br /><br /><br />We got to Dr. B's office at 1 and I was ready<br />I was having my severely impacted wisdom teeth cut out.<br /><br />Apparently, I cried during the whole procedure and told a story about kyle knocking out his teeth...who knows.<br /><br />As most of you know, I'm having this insane battle with my insurance company and they are refusing to pay for any of my medical bills.<br /><br />SOOOOOO my mom decided to tell Dr. B about this, and he did my entire surgery plus all my drugs - for free.<br />I've never had a pro-bono procedure, but I am so thankful - that's 7,000 that I don't have to pay for.<br /><br />Thank God my mom is once again in the dentistry business.<br /><br />So, my mom took me to CVS, filled all of my prescriptions &amp; bought enough ice cream products to feed all of the troops.<br /><br />I got home and slept for a few hours.<br />Kandace came over after work to check up on me &amp; couldn't believe that I was up walking around and smoking and eating.<br />I couldn't either.<br /><br />Yesterday Mom and I went out and I picked up some McDonalds - it took me 30 minutes to eat a hamburger - the fries were technically impossible, so i fed them to my dogs.<br />We rented Shrek 3 for the wii &amp; Arthur and the incredibles.<br /><br />I beat shrek 3 in 5 hours &amp; arthur and the incredibles wasn't very good.<br /><br />Darren &amp; Jordan called me @ 3:45 am and made me laugh so hard it hurt for two hours.<br />Darren was drunk &amp; inturn confessed his feelings openly. It was amazing.<br />Around 7 we all decided to go to bed.<br /><br />Today I was pain pill free and did about 7 loads of laundry.<br />I feel a lot better &amp; I'm ready to go back to work.<br />I'M SO BOREDDDDDDD!<br /><br />well that was my weekend.<br /><br />hmm.<br /><br /><br /><br /></font>"

You may be prettier.
You may have a better personality.

I'm tired of you taking over what is rightfully mine.
Moving in like a little virus.
destroying everything in your path.
To prove to yourself that you can do much better than 
what you already possess. 
It's disgusting what you've turned into.
and I hate you every day for it.

and stop fucking telling my mom everything.

just to turn around & tell me how crazy my mother is.

"event","the last time i saw your face was a warm summer night,
just like last night.

it's amazing how nothing has changed.
and how kissing you is better than ever.
yet exactly the same as before.

you're right, 
it would be funny if we ended up married,
but then again, 
it'd be perfect.

and i'd be happy.

god it's good to be able to see you again.
and feel your touch.
and see you smile.
and look at me as if im not real.

i like that you had to touch me to see if i was real.


i cried on the way home.
this is all ive wanted since you left.
and im so glad you're back.

even if its just until tuesday."

"event","You know.

Days like this make me wonder if living is all that great.

& makes me realize that a lot of my friends, were never really my friends all along.

but, it also makes me very thankful for the few, but precious, moments that have taken 
my breath away, when I least expected it.

take responsibility for it.

If you think that you are mature enough to make a decision,
don't deny that it happened.
Claim it.

What's the worst that can happen?
Someone might find out that you're not as perfect as you want everyone to believe."

I promise.<br />I really need some more queso, but whatever.<br /><br />So, my weekend was amazing.<br />I spent the majority of it with Mat &amp; Caleb.<br />On Saturday we met up around 6 &amp; drove around for a while - got lost downtown.&nbsp;<br />Caleb was passed out in his carseat. He is the cutest baby EVER.<br />Well, maybe I'm bias, but&nbsp;he <em>does </em>look just like Mat.<br />We went to the Erma's, I got to play with Caleb ALL night.<br />And then we went home.*we realized that we left Mat's phone at the Erma's*<br />As I was leaving Mat's, Caleb kissed me goodbye.&nbsp;<br />It was the </font><font color=""#00ffff""><strong>most precious thing ever.<br /><br /></strong>Went home - changed my clothes &amp; went to Tiffany's new apartment for the party.<br />Got crrrrrunnk.<br />Woken up at 5 am to eat with Tiff on her kitchen floor [yes, we were <em>that</em> drunk.]<br />Ate some AMAZING lasagna that Shauna &amp; Connor brought over.<br />Went BACK to bed, woke up 4 hours later.<br />Drove to the Erma's, got Mat's phone.<br />Called him &amp; made him come to my house to get his phone.<br />[and so I could see him &amp; caleb again &lt;3]<br />They stayed until 4:30. Once again, I played with Caleb&nbsp;<br />&amp; I have come to the decision that <u>I love that child</u>.<br />So, I went to work in an AMAZING mood.<br />Had a very positive night.<br />&amp; then went home, put on pjs.<br />And drove over to Mat's.<br />Stayed for a few hours &amp; then drove home.<br />And that is the end.<br /><br />Si, Good weekend.<br />It's funny how much I feel like I have my own family when I'm with Mat &amp; Caleb.<br />Not where I expected to be at, at 19.<br /><br />My mom thinks I'm too young to take on the responsibility of a baby part time,<br />but ANYONE who knows me, knows that a baby would be alright with me.<br /><br />p.s. Mat wrote me an e-mail.<br />""i had a really nice time with you and caleb did too. you realy impressed me how good you were with him i thought you were awesome tonight id love to do it again soon. im sorry my music sucked haha hope you had a good time at the party <br /><br />---M@T--- ""<br /><br />hehe.&nbsp;<br /><br />On a different note:<br />Dave should be here in a month.<br />and I'll be a married girl.<br />I'm starting to question my decisions.<br />Am I too young to be married?<br />Am I too 'boy-crazy' to stay with one boy for the rest of my life?<br />Am I just afraid?<br /><br />or did I find what i've been looking for in <sup>another boy</sup>?<br /></font></p>"

New purpose of this site to promote Project CoffeeButton's agenda as HQ sees fit.

Subject:Entity411
Date and Hour of transmission logged
----------------------------------------------------
Subject continues to elude any normal routine other than scheduled shifts at employer heretofore mentioned as ""Hastings""
Shifts are erratic and un-balanced, save for an average weekly total of 23 - 26 hours.
Hastings graces him with one cigarette break a shift, each of which lasts 5.5 - 6.5 hours, though subject has been acting more covert, which suggests that Hastings will be revoking this priveledge soon. Today surveilance at the workplace was cut short due to slow business as subject was let off shift earlier than scheduled, though subject does not seem too troubled by the loss of hours or pay, and then returned to place of residence.

Home life was interrupted as well, as subject proceeded to do laundry, which is a rare occurrence. As per usual no noted meal has been taken at or up to this time, subject has remained on his feet and at least remotely aware for bulk of day, even though subject had remained on predicted schedule up until 7:45 AM today. 
Sleep time logged: 7 hours 15 minutes 36 seconds.

As for social interaction, Subject has once again broken from agency predictions and remains at home, though Subject Tom has arrived and begun watching a DVD movie, ""One Hour Photo"" with Robin Williams. Subject shows little to no interest in actions of Subject Tom.

Intelligence report on Subject's frequent hang out, Location Alpha, heretofore noted as ""Alex's"",  shows location currently in upheaval, as Main Occupant 1, Subject <A HREF=http://www.livejournal.com/users/firenize>Firenize</a> left quickly and suddenly last night, current location is unknown, as intelligence did not pursue.
Though Subject <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/users/00zero>00Zero</a> did remain at location for a logged 30 minutes after departure of Main Occupant 1 ""Alex.""

Still no intelligence on Main Occupant 2, Subject Havoc.
No further intelligence on Main Occupant 3, Subject <A Href=http://www.livejournal.com/users/thedogofsputnik>Thedogofsputnik</a>

Do not use this as a contact, all communications will occur as normal.
Do not adjust your monitors, do not refresh the page.

We are interrupting transmission of Entity411's broadcast signal, should you desire, you can see confirmation on Entity411's most recent post in the form of typos and lack of coherence. 

This is not a test.

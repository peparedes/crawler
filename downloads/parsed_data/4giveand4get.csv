I'm not going to feel bad anymore about the way people are...thats just how it is and if I don't like it, I just have to move on.

"event","i came to the realization today that it doesn't matter if I'm around at all anymore. This is not saying im suicidal in any sense....just saying that people don't care if we hang out or not anymore. i have become a recluse. And i tell myself I dont care... but then why does it bother me sooo much? why do i care that no one calls? or stops by? i just dont understand. and its making me feel like there's something wrong with me. All these years of people coming in and out of my life.

oh..guess i should update since my last entry that Im getting married next october. crazy huh?"

I mean seriously, its because of all these stupid online communities and reading people's updates...etc. I mean we are now merely virtual friends. Why dont i just delete my accounts or delete my ""friends"". Because im masochistic i suppose. i need to see how much fun people are having without me in their lives. Sigh. Its soo silly. And on top of all that drama drama drama with my parents. i cannot wait for this vacation to start. i need a break from everyone, from work, family, the internet. im so exhausted. i need to find myself again. find my happiness. i get so worried about everything all the time. I dont want to NOT care but i want to find a happy medium.

hope my voice comes back today... ive been sick almost a week now :(


add-on: Ok so i just read like the last 20 entries i made. MY GOD was I a hot mess!!! I was emotionally unstable. I was the one who was the bad friend. I shouldnt have moved...i think things would be ALOT different if i stayed and did want I wanted to do or followed through with the commitments i made to my friends. Always a downfall to my existence is men. I KNOW now that it wont happen again. This time is for real...in more ways then i can (or want) to explain."

"event","I can't believe i can still log onto this thing. Wow, things have changed over the last two years. For the better I believe. Sharing my life finally with someone that is worth it. And that gives 110% back himself. I never thought I would be this lucky. I honestly thought I'd probably be alone and find myself in my late 30s settling for some douchebag cuz I didnt hold myself in a higher regard. Well, i guess i hit the lottery with this one.

I guess there is really only one thing that makes me unhappy. My ""friend"" situation. Maybe now im just becoming a hater.. or maybe Im just not as naive as Ive always been and im seeing people for the way they are. Either way, I dont have any friends. I feel completely abandoned by the people i used to care sooo much about. And i feel like ive tried. Yes i dont go to bars anymore...why? cuz i dont like to and i dont like drinking anymore. And this isnt because im in a relationship cuz i was like this even before. Im just tired of spending my time in a stinky ass bar watching people get wasted. So i invite people to come over to watch a movie or go out to dinner... and well, no one wants to do that, heavens no... thats too mundane. Well, geez, sorry i have a 9-5 that  dont like going out the night before. It just pisses me off cuz I feel like ive always been there for my friends and now they just threw me to the curb... cuz im not the one driving out to the bar to meet up with them. Forgot about calling or coming over... i guess we werent as good of friends as i had thought. It just makes me sad. Joe has his friends and they come over or ask him to go to dinner... and sure i go with them and its nice... but it makes me said because i just wish my friends would be like that. Always stand by you no matter what...whatever. I guess im just not worth it to some people... or i should say everyone that i used to consider a really good friend. I sick of puttin myself out there for people and getting taken advantage of and shit... I used to think, well they'll be sorry when im gone... But no, honestly I dont think they'd give a shit. So I hope one day i can get out of this city/town with joe and just forget all these people and all this bullshit. seriously. fuck it."

"event","is why life happens in cycles. Like i understand there is a down for every up, but come on! Cant someone enjoy the up for a little longer. geezus christ honestly. Im sick of this bullshit. ok i need to vent because otherwise im about to go postal. 
SO for starters i feel like a complete douchebag. why? Because im moving back to detroit in 2 and a half weeks. thats one. Let me put it this way. During this entire relationship, i have been the bad guy. Havent david moved, i feel like i had the ultimate decision to keep what we had going. He wanted to... and so did i. BUT it was up to me whether i was willing to move out with him or not. And so i did. If i didnt though, i would have been the bad guy, i would have been the one ""dumping"" him. Ok fine. So here i am, and i dont like it. I never wanted to move to cali before i met him. i wanted to move but in my mind it was chicago. So granted i didnt know i wasnt gonna like it out here and im glad that i tried it. But why is it SO WRONG that i decided that i dont want to live somewhere that is so goddamn far away from my friends and my family?? WHY IS IT SO WRONG? So now that i am the one moving back, i am the one doing the ""dumping"". I am automatically the bad guy. But oh wait! did anyone seem to forget the fact that  HE IS THE ONE THAT LEFT ME FIRST!!!!! does that not click in people's heads? cuz i know he is going around telling his friends how i am dumping him and all that shit. god, i am so sorry i dont want to live far away from the other people i love too, like my brothers and my sisters, and like jackie, brendan, and nick. the only people that i feel (aside from david) that understand me and care about me. 
So now i go home and i start over. Find a job, save some money, and move out again. Go back to school, im really gonna curb going to the bar too when i get back. I want to remain focused. Another part of being back at home has really gotten my head all fucked up. Things between me and david are great and im leaving it to be back home. And i start thinking about any possibilities back home and i dont think anyone will care about me, understand me, or respect me the way he does. And that freaks me out. i am convinced that 90% of the male population all act the same. And so what makes me think that i wont find anyone like dave ever again. I wont! He is not only in the ten percent but in the top 5% of the remaining 10%. if that makes any sense at all. 
So thats teh other thing that is buggin me. And its not like im trying to replace david already but honestly, i am not very optomistic about us having a chance after this. I mean, come on, how is it possibly gonna work out with someone that lives 2000 miles away and that is already telling his friends and probably his family that i have dumped him and that he is single. Go ahead and be single then! you dont seem so broken up over it. and i'll go home and be alone but at least i wont feel like a loser anymore. That is the worse feeling i can possibly have about myself. Feeling like i am an insignificant nothing. like i will always be the second thought. And thats what i am right now. But when i get home that is all gonna change. im gonna get a job, go back to school, and get a place, save some money. Do what i have to do to make myself happy. 

i hope that when i get home i can get things moving rather quickly. id hate to disappoint jackie if i cant be ready to move in january like i want to. its gonna be hard but this is what i want.I guess the thing im not looking forward to is all the explanations about why i am coming back. I hate having to explain myself because i automatically feel judged and that people wont get it anyway. 

i need to stop worrying about what other people think. You'd think i would be past all that now. I think im better than i used to be. Like it doesnt dictate my life. But it makes me upset still.

i need to find something to do right now.

"event","so this is the part where i freak out because that is what i do best. i dont think i could go any long extended period of time without freaking out otherwise id feel strange. yes it is true i am crazy in the head. 

ha

fucking ha

so where do i start? hmmmm maybe the fact that im trying to maintain a relationship with someone 3000 miles  away!!!!! WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING?!?!?!?!? seriously. ive never done this before. i can barely stand being away from certain people for a few days let alone months at a time. so here is where i question everything. my feelings for him, his feelings for me. are they strong enough? does he really care about me as much as he says? what is he holding on to? honestly. ""why would he want to be tied down to you. what are you to him? you're nothing special that would make him wait for you"".... maybe thats true maybe its all true. maybe im just pretending like this will have some fairy tale ending. but it wont. how can it? how can i possibly expect someone who knew me for two months to push everyone else to the back burner and wait for me? i dont even know when i could get out there... i'll visit sure. but then what? BUT THEN WHAT!?!?!?! what do i do then? i want to move out there but i have the worst feeling that when im ready (which cant be any earlier than july because of my lease here in ferndale)... is he still gonna be there? is this all going to be in vain? 

jackie i know you said that i should move only if I want to... and that i should do it for myself... and yea, i want it so badly for myself. but goddammit ive never been so torn to pieces by something before. i feel like if i was cool enough to be living in california he would be with me in a second... but no i live here and he's there. and he took my heart with him and didnt bother sending it back. i lvoe when songs just fucking nail it right on the head 

fucking a- new found glory<small>i wake up
something more than what i'm supposed to be
something more than i have meant to show.
how was i supposed to know
that i've wanted, and i've waited.

and i can be the one
to show you that life's not simple enough.
and i can be the one
to tell you i've held this back for too long.

and my heart aches...
these feelings i've held inside for you.
and my heart aches...
how can I stop the pain? </small>

why if i dont hear from him for a day i freak out? im freaking out right now because i havent heard from him. did i bother to call him? NO! why?!!?!?!? because im scared. im upset i dont want him to talk to me like this... all frazzled and dismayed. i cant talk to anyone about this without them thinking ive gone completely insane. seriously

what the fuck am i doing?

these feelings are owning me. its like i cant function. i feel like i got dumped but i know i havent. god this is so fucked up... i dont like it at all."

so far from your charms,

it is a far cry more than anything that I deserve.
I'm waiting to give you whatever the world may bring
I'd give you my life

I'd give you my life

man ive been in such a girly mood lately. ive been flooding myself with chick flicks like ""in her shoes"" (the one with cameron diaz and shirley mclaine) and ""just like heaven"" (with reese witherspoon and mark ruffalo). i did happen to mix it up there with ""waiting"" and ""grandma's boy"" ... otherwise i think that it would have resulted in me laying in bed all day watching chick flick after flick eating a pint of ice cream (preferably mint chocolate chip). why? i have no idea. i guess its just one of those things."

"event","i suppose another long awaited update from yours truly...

where do i even begin. this month has been a bit of a rollercoaster. some amazing things have happened... and somethings not so amazing anymore have ended. i guess thats what happens as time moves quickly ahead. i feel like i missed something along the way. but here i am  trying to go over everything that has changed...and those things that have stayed the same.

i dont think i can really put an order to any of this cuz its really been a blur. ive never been good at structuring things that i write anyway. 

meeting dave was probably the best thing that has happened to me in a long long time. it is actually scaring the shit out of me, these feelings that i have. honestly it feels like it did when tony and i first got together 4years ago. everything just becomes second to him...its strange. like talking to other poeple isnt really that high on my list. and the thing is that its not like all my time is consumed by him..how could it be? he's been gone for almost two weeks. but my thoughts are so preoccupied about him that i lose all sense of time... its strange. i mean, not unusual, but it has happened only rarely in my life. i could go on and on about how amazing he is. but in a nutshell, i dont think i have ever met someone as gorgeous, thoughtful, compassionate, caring, considerate, motivated, driven, accomplished, etc, etc. seriously who would have thought that the day would come that i would meet someone that has shit going for him, has his shit together as is, who i think is smokin hot, and is totally into me. just wow. thats all i can say.

its scary cuz i dont know whats gonna happen in the near future but this newfound purity and openness is a great feeling. i think alot of this has to do with what i want in life right now. i want someone that is willing to work jsut as hard as i am to keep something together. i mean im hoping this is the year i make a big decision in my life. well several decisions. one being where im gonna go to grad school and what i want to go there for. two schools at the top of my list are: argosy university in san francisco and the chicago school of professional psychology. both look really great. im scared. i dont really want to leave.. but i dont think  that i want to stay around here for grad school... i mean, maybe, its an option. but even if its here, its gonna require a move cuz i know i dont want to go to oakland u or wayne state. i hope that whatever happens that certain people will come with me. mainly jackie. i mean im gonna miss things around here but i know that if shes around i will be ok. i feel like im a lot of talk and no action but i know that when it really comes down to it... for me to make this decision... i will and i wont look back. 

things are different around here. im not so attached to people anymore. i think that over the last few years just by supporting myself ive realized that im really the only one i can count on. i cant assume that someone else is always gonna be there. even my parents. like i know as much as the care about me and my well-being, they cant take care of me. they dont have the means. its kind of a scary thought, not having the parental safety net to fall back on but i dont feel like ive had that in a long time. i feel like i grew up alot faster becuase of it and became alot more controlling and stubborn as well. *sigh*... i feel certain people drifting away. it suppose it was bound to happen... time/life gets in the way. i wish i could devote more time to the people that i know and care about but at this stage you have to be choosy. it sucks, but ive never been one to have a ridiculous multitude of friends. it would just take too much out of me. 

dont talk to the boys that much anymore... it makes me sad i wish that we could still be close but i know that is a selfish thing on my part. i know why things are like this... i dont want them to be but i really dont have a choice in the matter. i just hope that my friendship with nakeddave isnt one that will completely fizzly out because of this. cuz i would like nothing more than to be life long friends with him. 

another set of information that i came across was the fact that steve is dating this 18 yr old. and i cant help but assume that he was ""seeing her"" the entire time he was ""seeing me""... what a shady ass motherfucker.... i feel like an idiot for wasting ten months!!! on that kid. lesson learned i suppose... but he did teach me that i should expect people to give me more than i have been given. and i dare say there were moments when he was genuine about me being a great person and really enjoying spending time with me. that was apparant. it hurts that i told him how i got horribly fucked over in the past and all these really really personal things... to be met by yet another rejection by him. i hope this isnt a pattern, blah.

im having issues with the way i look lately... maybe cuz im exhausted and i feel like ive been putting zero effort into my appearance. so i guess im dis-satisfied with myself. 

i think i need a nap cuz ive been soooo super exhausted lately. 

so end."

saw ""pride and prejudice"" last night and i was blown away. i want to be in love like that. but i have to keep reminding myself its only a movie. 

sometimes i get so lost in my thoughts that i forget the important things that are going on around me. i wouldnt say its being self-absorbed in a negative way, but my mind is pulling me in all directions with so many thoughts and questions that i suppose is making me seem distant or preoccupied. because i really am. and its not just what or whom, but everything... i think now that i have finished school and have this time on my hands, im actually getting the opportunities to sit back evaluate, reevaluate, without any real conclusions about where im going in this life, why, and how. maybe im just in the transitional period because i dont have the security of being in school anymore, and i actually need to make decisions for the future. its not that i dont want to but its that i have been putting it off. for what? for late nights out with friends, and watching movies. but this time off has been refreshing. relaxing. i'll be sorry when its over. 

i wish my mom would get back so i can go home and go to bed.. .actually correction so i can go home and see if he'll come over.

"event","i suppose i should really update this...besides today is my day off and im bored. so yea, anyways. this wekk has been a rollercoaster. first of all, having my first semi-spat with colleen has not been fun. although im hoping since we talked quite a bit yesterday that the silent treatment is over and things can go back to normal. or at least as normal as can be. on top of that, dave hasnt talked to me all week. which im not sure why. i mean we had some words like a week and a half ago but i thought that things should have blown over. apparantly not. friday night i let lombardi drive my car at nationals.. which he then shortly there after ran into a curb leaving me carless and $500 in debt. i guess i learned my lesson not to let people drive my car even if they are cousins to my best friend. got to see williams quite a bit his break despite not talking to dave. so that was nice. he's super nice and im glad that i got to really get to know over the last few months. so i guess this is where id like to recap the weekend. so saturday i was all depressed about my car situation and no one was returning my calls and i guess i was at the point where i was frustrated so i crawled into bed around 7pm. then at 11, i text jackie to apologize for not wanting to go out, which in turn led to an almost horrible fiasco. However after a brief ultimatum, ""come out tonight or we'll never be friends again"", i reluctantly went to this party in royal oak. upon arriving i felt by far like the youngest one there but everyone (despite how tool-y they looked) was really cool. there was beer pong in the basement and karaoke in the bar. super fun singalongs (hahahaha korn!!!!). jackie and i tore it up in the basement with some killer dance moves. (as usual!) i met some really cool people, really nice, funny. best part was meeting this guy dave, which i guesstimated to be 26 by looking at the average age of the party... but i ended talking to him and his buddy mike (sounds just like dane cook its uncanny) i wonder if he was getting annoyed by me repeatedly asking him to quote lines from dane cook's cd. anywho then i met this girl carly, dave's cousin, who was super hip and classy. i dug her alot. well after 4am quickly approached i made an exit. (upon which dave suggested that id call him sometime *smiles*) and jackie, justin, gerard, rachel , and i headed over to leos for some late night munchies. i got home finally at 5am and slept until 2pm the next day, (which was amazing). then I stayed in bed til 7 watching lame mtv shows... but they suck you in i swear. then i get a call from, who would have thought, dave, asking if i wanted to go to a show. why would i say no? psssh, so i head out to northville and hangout with him for a few hours, afterwards we chatted it up at starbucks but it was shortlived cuz i had to get the car home. but he said he wants to hang out again so that sounds good. you know what sucks though? meeting someone really cool and then them telling you that they are moving to the opposite side of the country in less than 4 weeks. totally blows! so then i get home and williams and moylen come pick me up and we go over to the royal oak coney and sit there for 2 hours or so talking and laughing and what not. it was great. besides williams was leaving this morning so i had to see him last night. so all that is left today is to figure out with to do with my car, try to get a hold of lombardi and see if he'll throw some cash my way, take tony home, wab tonight with jackie and whoever, laundry... i think thats it. right now though im gonna keep reading this book i started this morning. its soooo good so far. end."

And I guess these things just tend to fall apart
And I hope you feel the same""

""I have never cried in anybody's arms
The way that I have often cried in yours 
Please be the one to take my tears away
I was 22, I've had my share of views
I just can't steal that ""happiness"" from you
But I'll be the one to take your tears away
I can't believe the things you say
tell me, tell me
tell me the lies
Fasting love will lead us all to nowhere
When, when will we learn
I shall avenge the death of all the romance
Until, until I'm gone"""

"event","i dont know why i feel the  need to justify myself to someone's stupid comment on my livejournal. but i do. there is a reason i have a livejournal. its not attract attention or have a pity party. i write in it because its the only outlet i have to write about things that i dont want to talk to other people about. yes, granted my livejournal is typically about boys and relationships and what not. so what of it? it was brought to my attention that i need to get a hobby and stop pining over boys blah blah blah. well, lets set the record straight. 

i will be graduating from college in less than two weeks with my bachelor degree in psychology
i work 40 hours a week waitressing
i go to the bar every thursday and saturday (typically) with my best friends and have the best time ever. 
If i have ANY free time, its usually going/watching to the movies, hanging out with my family or my roommates, making t-shirts, or sitting on the computer downloading music. 

so? i dont have a life apparantly and i waste all my time hung up on relationships instead of writing a script or painting or playing music. how would you even know that? all i write about is my relationship problems cuz thats what i want to talk about. everything else in my life is for the most part great. so yea, the fact that the only thing im worried about is finding someone isnt that bad considering most people my age dont know what the hell they are doing with their life. 

i hate when people try to tell me to ""get over"" something in my livejournal. im not gonna censor what i write about. apparantly im pathetic and waste my time on pining over guys. i guess my only solution is to be glued to the internet and write about every great thing that happens to me everyday so i dont seem so obsessed with this apparant problem i have. hmmm seems the only logical answer. thank you so much whoever you are for putting my life into perspective for me. wow, you are amazing. <small> i hope you could tell how ridiculously sarcastic im being</small>

end. 

p.s. you want a half-way decent journal entry. fine heres more:

my parents are getting a divorce. they have been married for 18 years and have 4 children including myself. my brothers and sister still live with them and two of them are very young. im afraid they are getting damaged emotionally by being there. if i could take care of them i would but i cant, just to get them out of the house. i get phone calls 3-4 times a week from one or the other parent telling me how horrible their life is. and how they arent happy and what should they do. ive become a therapist to my family. Not on purpose of course. i hear about things that i dont want to know about, about things they've done in the past and shitty things they have done to each other. it makes me sad to think that two people could be so miserable. holidays are a joke and only bring on feelings of isolation and awkwardness, not of love and happiness. ive tried to tell them to go to a counselor but my efforts are going no where. perhaps they could work it out, but as of this moment, they are staying together for the kids."

"event","so next summer (i.e. leaving this state) cant come soon enough... this cold is settling in for the long haul. im not ready, im not ready for a lot of things. im not ready to let go, im not ready to move on, im not ready to be friends, im not ready for it to be over. this is a reflection of every aspect of my life right now... things are changing so fast. and im still trying to make sense of what happened weeks ago. its overwhelming. i think the lack of sleep is bringing about this sudden but drastic drop in confidence/faith/security, cuz at this very moment right now, i wont nothing more than to be alone and have nothing to do with anyone. my trust in people is basically out the window and i feel like im setting myself up to be the fool,  yet i dont change. winter seems to be the best time to hermit and become forgettable. id rather do that than the alternative. wishing, hoping, striving for things that will never come true. im putting the hopeless romantic bit to bed, its starting to kill me. literally. im seconds away from chopping off all my hair. im seconds away from throwing in the towel with school. im seconds away from leaving and never coming back. im sure i could get to at least iowa before someone would notice. depressed? sure, but who isnt? i dont need hand outs or hugs. i know im gonna be ok, but i just dont think that i could ever do it here. theres too much baggage, too much never working out. too much that hurts.

"event","its finally october... this means a several things. a. that its my favorit time of the year. b. that ""fall"" smell... during the day, the breeze...during the night, the woodburning. c. that its time for cider mills and donuts and pumpkins and walks along trails with a multitude of beautiful colored leaves. d. sweaters. e. halloween and haunted houses. e. i'll be another year older, 22 (yikes!). f. shortened days and longer nights (dont really thinks thats a good thing). 

so whats wrong? today i feel inspired i want to write or paint. i just got done decorating the house for halloween  with the little bit of things that i had packed away from the Barrett house. and as much as im happy about all these things there is that thing thats missing.

i want a boyfriend

im sick of dating, im sick of things not working out. i dont want to pretend anymore. i dont want to be hanging out with these guys and feel that it doesnt mean anything to them. It really doesnt and i ""deal"" with it so to speak cuz what else can i do. i fall for the wrong people. i lie to myself to believe that these people actually KNOW things about me. whats my favorite color? whats my middle name? whats my favorite movie of all time? and they  wouldnt even know. they wouldnt. why? because they dont care. why should they? they have no obligations or committments. i think what i miss most about a boyfriend isnt the sex. i miss someone that will walk down one of thsoe autumn trails with me and hold my hand... and we'd stop under the tree near the river and hed put one hand on my hip the other caressing my cheek, telling me im the most beautiful thing hes ever seen. a hopeless romantic? me?...are you kidding? heh, i miss having someone there that i can do things for. not like i dont do things for my friends but its different. ive given my love to people and its been so unconditional, so pure and true...and even though i fuck things up, it doesnt change the fact that that person is my world. that id give/do anything for them. and now, although ive given my heart to something, its not the same, because as much as im putting it out there, that person doesnt want it. so my heart's in limbo so to speak. i know im beautiful and smart. but why cant i seem to have anyone for my own?... maybe im too picky. it kills me. ive been so dead inside for so long and then i'll meet someone and they start this spark...and after time it grows bigger and bigger and i can atually start to feel things again. that innocence that i havent known in years. but then what? its not being nourished  anymore and it seems such a waste after all this time to just distinguish it. so right now, its slowly growing dimmer and dimmer. i dont believe in love anymore... seems like a bunch of bullshit really. im just sick of letting myself get invloved with these people and they could care less about me. do they know my dreams, my hopes, my fears? do they know the littlest things about me? like i have a scar on my forehead from when i was 7 and had the chicken pox...do i actually expect someone to know that? hahahhaah no. but thats what i want eventually. i want to know secrets... i want to have cute little inside jokes with someone. i want an amazing sex life. i want someone thats intelligent and driven and focused... someone that knows what they want and what they want from me. someone that isnt selfish or controlling. someone that might actually be able to take care of themselves, enough so to even take me out. ive been down this road too many times. i sick of pretending im sick of hurting. i dont mind the time alone anymore but it just scared me. i feel like a failure. maybe after this semester things will change.... i'll be graduated, a ba under my belt. and i wont have to feel tied down anymore. this freedom frightens me.... but to hell with my anxiety. chicago seems more and more like a good idea as the time slowly passes by. i have nothing here in michigan. friends.. sure, family....sure. but i feel trapped i feel like im living my life in a circle, that the same things keep happening over and over again. as much as i swear that i have learned from my mistakes... and here i am again. alone, frustrated. kicking myself in the ass for being so stupid. maybe i should be the one doing the deceiving, beat them at their own game. but then i sit back and think... i could have it all but ive blown off or ignore my opportunities for some fantasy. i just want to be loved. and feel that feeling that you get when you're with someone and you feel like nothing and no one can stop you as long as you are with that person. they give you the strength and optomism to be the best that you can be. maybe this is my flaw, the fact that i cant do this for myself. hmmmmm, it seems an awful waste to feel like this. 

screw those photographs, those letters, those songs, those movies, those memories, we;ve built them all on a lie. a lie that i told myself and one that youve told me honestly from the beginning that im fooling myself. im the only one to blame

""I had the notion that you'd make me change my ways
My bad habits would be gone in a matter of days
I had the feeling that you'd open up my eyes
To a whole new world that had since been in disguise

But that day will most likely never come for me
And it's just my luck to end up getting stuck
To everything you are

So tonight I'll sit and pick apart your pictures
And overanalyze your words
But the truth is that I've never fallen so hard
It's taking everything in me
Just to forget your sweater so far

I had the notion that you'd make me forget the world
But your undecisive mind shows me that
You are ""just another girl""
I had the feeling that those looks you gave me were real
What if I ripped your heart apart at the seams
Maybe then you'd know how I feel

But that day will most likely never come for me
And it's just my luck to end up getting stuck

That I never, ever, ever felt this way
Your lips, your eyelashes, your skin
These are the parts of your body
That cause my comatose to begin

I will sleep another day
I don't really need to anyway
What's the point when my dreams are infected
With words you used to say
I will breathe in a moment
As long as I keep my distance
I wouldn't want to go messing anything up

So don't go worrying about me
It's not like I think about you constantly
So maybe I do, but that shouldn't affect
Your life anymore
I knew it the moment you walked into the door

So don't go worrying about me

Because there's nothing else that I do well
I'll let you get the best of me
Because there's nothing else that I do well
I'll be the giver and you'll be the taker
I guess that's how this one's gonna go I'll be the giver and you'll be the taker
You've got me down on my knees and I proclaim
All hail the heartbreaker"""

Rocks Tonic Juice Magic"" ~Saves the DAy.

Let me take this awkward saw
And run it against your thighs
Cut some flesh away
I'll carry this piece of you with me
Because all I can say tonight
is that I hate you
But it would be all right
If we could see each other sometime
If I could somehow make you mine
And if not I'll take my rusty spoons
And dig out your blue eyes
I'll swallow them down to my colon
They're gonna burn like hell tonight
Because you're beautiful
Just not on the inside
Light comes from within
And your beaming eyes don't seem so bright
My heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done
Boardwalks and breaking waves
Made our Saturdays
I'd buy you lemonade right now
if you were here
But then I'd throw it in your face
And I'd listen to you cry
And I'd remember how I miss
our nights under ocean skies
You and I are like when fire
and the ocean floor collide."

""Demolition Lovers""

Hand in mine, into your icy blues
And then I'd say to you we could take to the highway
With this trunk of ammunition too
I'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets

I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know just how much you mean to me
And after all the things we put each other through and

I would drive on to the end with you
A liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full
And I feel like there's nothing left to do
But prove myself to you and we'll keep it running

But this time, I mean it
I'll let you know just how much you mean to me
As snow falls on desert sky
Until the end of everything
I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know how much you mean
As days fade, and nights grow
And we go cold

Until the end, until this pool of blood
Until this, I mean this, I mean this
Until the end of...

I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know how much you mean
As days fade, and nights grow
And we go cold

But this time, we'll show them
We'll show them all how much we mean
As snow falls on desert sky
Until the end of every...

All we are, all we are
Is bullets I mean this


As lead rains, will pass on through our phantoms
Forever, forever
Like scarecrows that fuel this flame we're burning
Forever, and ever
Know how much I want to show you you're the only one
Like a bed of roses there's a dozen reasons in this gun

And as we're falling down, and in this pool of blood
And as we're touching hands, and as we're falling down
And in this pool of blood, and as we're falling down
I'll see your eyes, and in this pool of blood
I'll meet your eyes, I mean this forever"

<TD align=middle><FONT size=5><B>Emo Kid</B></FONT><BR>You are 42% Rational, 14% Extroverted, 28% Brutal, and 14% Arrogant. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>You are the Emo Kid, best described as a quiet pussy! You tend to be an intuitive rather than a logical thinker, meaning you rely more on your feelings than your thoughts. Not only that, but you are introverted, gentle, and rather humble. You embody all the traits of the perfect emo kid. You are a push-over, an emotional thinker, gentle to the extent of absurdity, and so humble that it even makes Jesus puke. If you write poetry, you no doubt write angsty, syrupy lines about depression, sadness, and other such redundant states of emo-being. Your personality is defective because you are too gentle, rather underconfident in yourself, decidely lacking in any rational thought, and also a bit too inhibited. 
<P>I probably made you cry, didn't I? Fucking Emo Kid. 
<P><B>To put it less negatively:</B> 
<P><I>1. You are more INTUITIVE than rational. 
<P>2. You are more INTROVERTED than extroverted. 
<P>3. You are more GENTLE than brutal. 
<P>4. You are more HUMBLE than arrogant.</I> 
<P><B>Compatibility:</B> 
<P>Your exact opposite is the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=100&score2=100&score3=100"">Smartass</A>.

<P>* 
<P>* 
<P><I>If you scored near fifty percent for a certain trait (42%-58%), you could very well go either way. For example, someone with 42% Extroversion is slightly leaning towards being an introvert, but is close enough to being an extrovert to be classified that way as well. Below is a list of the other personality types so that you can determine which other possible categories you may fill if you scored near fifty percent for certain traits.</I>

"event","It takes more time than I've ever had,
Drains the life from me,
Makes me want to forget,
As young as I was,
I felt older back then, 
More disciplined,
Stronger and certain, 
But I was scared to death of eternity, 
I was saved by grace, 
But destroyed by naivety, 
And I lied to myself, 
And said it was for the best,

And now faith is replaced with a logic so cold
I've disregarded what I was, 
Now that I'm older, 
And I know much more than I did back then, 
But the more I learn, 
The more I can't understand, 
And I've become content with this life that I lead, 
Where I drink to much and don't believe in much of anything, 
And I lie to myself, 
And say it's for the best,

We're moving forward,
But holding ourselves back, 
And we're waiting on something that will never come,"

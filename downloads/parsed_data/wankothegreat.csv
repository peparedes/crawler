one of which: my alarm clock.

last night i had a dream my alarm clock was going off. so i woke up, turned it off (even though i didn't realize it wasn't ON)and got up to take a shower. but when i was in the hallway, i looked at mom's clock through the door... i had only been asleep for two hours! it was 12:18 in the morning! so i went back to bed.... only to do the SAME THING at around 3:00 AM! I ended up waking up to my parents alarm clock at 5:40. *grumbles* and then i went to take a shower.. but there wasn't any shampoo that i was ""supposed"" to use by reccommendation of my hairstylist. 
IN MID-RINSE I REALIZED THE WATER WAS <B> PURPLE</b>!!! 
i am not having a very good day, and this weekend isn't going to be very good either. son of a bitch."

"event","this morning mom told me that we spent $115.00 at the hair salon last night, so i said ""fuck."" in front of my parents. mom gasped, dad said ""you best be getting a job soon."" so get me a job, anybody. i spent two and a half hours in that salon, and my hair looks okay. i'm not estatic over it, but it's okay. 

do you know what i really really hate? ELITISTS. people that think that they are the shit, that everything they like is the shit, but everything and everyone they don't like doesn't matter to anyone and should fuck off and die. Elitists <i> suck</i>. 

dad totally saw me and matt making out yesterday. i only got to see matt for like an hour. i miss him already. 

today after school im going to james' house to play bass for him. i need a cord, but i don't have one. and dad hasn't made me one yet. it'd be so much easier to just go out and buy one, but nooooo that's too easy. 

today and this week, is going, to suck."

ahh, yes. tonight matt and i made out. a little bit, because my dad was around the corner and i am sick. the tippy toe thing--does not work when you're clutching a six foot tall guy. don't care about knocking teeth. don't care about slobber or not that pleasant breath. i just feel The Great Content when we cuddle. it's nice. <i> real </i> nice. yay!
a quote from tonight:""Slobber isn't so bad when you're trading viral diseases."" yes. The Great Content. 

mom also came home today from texas, that's why matt had to leave early. [<b>?#$%&^@*!&#%</b>]she brought me a teddy bear. i was looking at my ears, and i'm like ""Damn. THey don't look healthy."" but i looked closer, and it's the scar tissue from when i got my ears RE-pierced for Sheila & Dave's wedding. so i just slapped on some neosporin and got in my pjs, so here i am now. it's going to be a boring weekend. matt has play practice, i might be forced to go play basketball with another matt, matt frasier. i don't want to go. at all. i HATE. HAATEhatehateLOATHE basketball. i'm going to go surf vampirefreaks now.

i am sick as a dog. my throat tastes like i just puked, but i didn't. it's also sore. i woke up at three in the morning because i was CHOKING on my own loogie. I couldn't breathe normally for like 10 minutes! and i think I have a fever... my head hurts too. 

last night i found a website called www.angelindustrial.com which is a website for the industrial scene, IN BOSTON! wee! even though I'm a minor. hehe. but i wrote down all the radio stations that play industrial, so it'll all be okay.

"event","I've come to an epiphany about how I have been feeling in the past few weeks. It's been panic. I thought it was manic depression-- you know, bipolar moods, <i> hallucinating, </i> just feeling like death in general. But it's really just panic, and I don't know why.

Part of it could be my friend I met online, who only has 8 months to live. Another part of it could be that I've convinced myself the world is going to end in seven years and that I don't know what to do in those seven years that would make my short time worth it. Another part of me just wants to hang myself and get my bitching over with. It's just fear and helplessness. 

And Matt has helped me immensely, he's the nicest guy I've met in a long time. I hope I can see him on Friday, even though my parents aren't going to be around. I miss him alot.

I feel really terrible right now because I met a guy, also named Matt but nicknamed Kam-kun, on the Vampirefreaks chatroom. He needed someone, and I was there. I haven't talked to him in awhile, but last night we were chatting about gauging and manic depression, you know all that good stuff. I feel like I've betrayed him, like I've cheated on him. But I still love him and want to help him get through his two friend's deaths... I feel pretty goddamned stupid."

The trick to desk snorting is having a partner. Sure, it's a lame way to do it, but the distraction is key in order to hide the snuffling. Sitting in the back of the classroom helps as well, because snorting is a risky thing to do, and in public it could be suicide. The chubby blonde sitting in the desk in front of the classroom sighs into her book and turns the page, droning on about polynomials or some shit that we were supposed to learn years ago. The time is perfect. I hiss in Jerry's direction, and he turns around. He sits in the front row. He nods, and I nod... business is in order. He asks a stupid question that forces the blonde to get up and do some problems on the board to help him understand them. I think our teacher is more depressed than some of us. What a fucking cheerful thought, I think to myself, as I use my pocket knife to scrape the white powder into a thin line on my desk. It's the best thing about the desks at school. Not the graffiti from years past, but the pencil holder. The indent at the top of the surface, it's perfect for snorting. Most kids wouldn't think of it, but I am a genius. I grab a McDonald's straw I took from the Cafeteria and cut it in fourths, so the coke doesn't have too far to go. I hate it when it gets stuck in the goddamned straw, it's so damn expensive anyway. Jerry coughs, his sign that the teacher is calming down and will start paying more attention soon. I take a look around, stick the straw in my nose, and SNERK. It takes a moment after i've yanked the straw out of my nose to regain my conscience. My nose feels tingly, and I cough gently. Jerry coughs again, and the teacher gives me a questioning look. I shrug and doodle in my notebook so it looks like I'm at least paying attention. Hell, I already know all this Math shit. I'm rather good at parallel lines."

today i woke up at about 9:47, came downstairs, and watched tv. dad was on the phone with Dell tech support. [he ended up getting off the phone with them around four thirty in the afternoon, and never got out of his pyjamas.] i layed around all morning and watched two hours worth of E.R. and got all depressed (the black surgeon guy's nephew died of a gunshot wound and he couldn't save him) and then i got my act together and went to cvs to buy stuff. i got epsom salt for my ears (which you can see through now, they're 8s or 7s now, i'm not sure. i know there aren't any odd gauges, shutup.)i also got purple eyeshadow and this got2b hair shiny stuff. matt likes my hair, so i'll make it prettier for him since the dye doesn't ever stay in it. *gets angry* then i came home and watched more tv, played ddr, played ffx, went to my room and did artsy shit for a few hours while listening to my second copy of nothing and nowhere because i scratched up the first copy so much. then i watched more tv, and then mom came home late at around five twenty two. sorry, i always remember exact times. wait, im not sorry, FUCK YOU! *ahem* pent up aggression right there. and she starts bitching and yelling at me and going on and on about yata yata yata... little does she know i did 12401823408130 chores today because i knew she would appreciate it...which she didn't. *swears under breath* but most of all this rant is about:

MY COMPUTER CRASHED AND WIPED OFF EVERYTHING

think of it this way. all my writing, pictures, photos, school work, favorites list, aim, computer games, quickbooks, aol, e v e r y t h i n g. got wiped off. but most importantly it was my writing that i lost and that's fucking upsetting because it was my life. so upset. depressing. 

but matts coming over tomorrow at around 2-3. he's bringing fear and loathing in las vegas and this serbian independant film for us to watch. get this. my mom wanted to watch movies with us. i think she just wants to keep an eye on us because she thinks im a fucking whore or something. other than that, nothing for the weekend. another matt thing perhaps on monday.

Damn."" when i woke up. then later in classes things got a little worse, people made fun of me a little more, people became more horrible and disgusting... coming to the realization that i've been flirting with jason constantly and im hanging out with matt in a sortof date scenerio on saturday... which poses to be a problem, because i like em both, except matt's so much more intellectual and jason talks about sex WAY too much. and by the end of the day i got so p.o.ed i was randomly punching hte desk just so i could feel pain. i even punched jason. not too hard, but ya know. i apologized, and he tried to make me happy. an admirable effort, but it just didn't cut the mustard. im so tired, my eyelids are getting heavy. im on dad's laptop because it's th eonly way to get online these days. damn computer. i found this nifty piece of broken glass on the side of the road walkign home today. it was kindof sharp. ashley couldn't go to the game, so i had to go home instead of watching alex play. he said it wa s a bad game anyway, he almost got in a fight with somebody. i cried on the way home for awhile. i made up a song too...""nobody's in the world, theres only me, no happiness around, theres only grief, they poke at me, laugh at me, they are real quite rude.. i am a delicacy, i am people food."" yeah, so im going to bed now. tomorrow is saturday. i have to mow the lawn. *sigh*"

Don't you bring me no sunshine today 
I need the grey skies and the rain 
You never understand my pain 
I need the wind to blow it away 

Afternoon showers for me 
The coldness is all that I see 
It numbs my pain so deep 
The storm it will rock me to sleep 

Rain 
Will wash away my sorrow 
Clouds 
Make me see the light 
Wind 
Carries me away 
To the place 
I want to be 

Alone in the dark sky tonight 
I feel the thunder will make it alright 
Lightning strikes me down to you 
Love of the darkness will help me through 

Rain 
Will wash away my sorrow 
Clouds 
Make me see the light 
Wind 
Carries me away 
To the place 
I want to be"

"event","From Ghost In The Shell.Mind you, all of these robots have rather high pitched girly voices.

Robot 1: Is there a point in fighting over superficial differences?
Robot 2: Do looks really matter?
Robot 3: Isn't that important?
Robot 1: I guess that appearance is important to humans, isn't it?
Robot 4: No, that's incorrect. It'll be a problem if we look too much like humans. The boundry line between humans and robots has become the slight differences in our physical bodies. Think about why our parts aren't allowed to look human.
Robot 2: So that we're more effecient weapons?
Robot 4: That too, but the most important reason is that the user would feel too strongly for us if we looked human. We'd be even more disliked
Robot 1: Then, what about her? ::points to human-looking robot::
Robot 4: She's okay because her abilities are limited. She will not become a threat to mankind.
Robot 3: I see
Robot 2: So just what in the world should we do?
Robot 4: As I said, people expect machines to act like machines, no?
Robot 1: I see! So if we act more like machines the Major will like us better!
Robot 4: Exactly!
Robot 2: Okay, I'll call it ""Mission Robot"".
All: WE ARE ROBOTS... WE ARE ROBOTS... WE ARE ROBOTS...
::Major enters::
Robot 3: Ah, the Major's here!
Robot 1, in monotone: Ah, Major, good morning.
Major: Morning, have you see Batou?
Robot 1, in monotone: Yes, he went that way.
Major: Okay... thanks. ::leaves::
All, monotone: No problem, you're welcome.
Robot 1: How was that? Quite good, wasn't it?
Robot 4: Yes, a rather robotic greeting.
All: GREAT GREAT WE DID IT!"

"event","Today was one of the greatest days of my life, if you can believe that. I hung out after school with Jay so we could do our arabian essay... HAH! Like that happened. I actually should really do it so I don't get in trouble. But anyways, we walked to his house first so he could tell his dad, and then we walked to the park by the library. We sat and we flirted for awhile, it was really cold and kindof windy. He burned some leaves and kept spitting [one of the smoking curses] and it  was all around a pleasant time. There was some groping on my part, well, I was the groper. I think it's sad that I'm 14 and I'm seducing a 17 almost 18 year old. But then this guy smoking a cigarette comes by. He starts talking to Jason, and he sits down. His name is Vaughn. He's this fucking cool guy. Then he left, and then he came back again."

"event","""On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone goes to zero."" FIGHT CLUB. I think I broke my left wrist. It sucks because that's the one I jack my invisible friend off with. [he likes it fast]. Autumn apparently had another asthma attack, and almost died... again. Jesus, can somebody get this kid a new set of lungs? It irks me because she loves to tell everybody how she has almost died from the asthma attacks... ARGH! COME ON! DO YOU <b> WANT </b> TO DIE?! Egads. Well, she could just want sympathy. Reminds me of that Toxic Narcotic song... ""don't want your fucking pity"" something something.. don't remember the lyrics. I am the only one who likes Toxic Narcotic in my high school. It fucking blows. But then again, I'm the only kid in my school who listens to The Birthday Massacre, Lunarclick, A Covenant of Thorns, and Club Decease... it's kindof depressing, actually. I'd never give up this music, but I'd love to have somebody close to listen to it with me. There's always that kid with the KMFDM shirts and the Invader Zim bag but... *scrunches nose* I don't want to talk to him. He's a sophmore, and he has so many friends already... *shrug*. Today Mrs. Manosh almost puked on the floor, it was hilarious. I hope she's okay though. It was third class of the day, at like.. 10:30. MAYBE SHE'S GOT MORNING SICKNESS! Hahahaha. Which reminds me of all those other upperclassmen who carry plastic babies around all day for that class... something about making right choices in life. So stupid. I hate saying this but that class is so gay. There are times when I just cannot deny the stupidness of something and have to say that it's gay. Oh well. I'm so bored right now I'm wearing lipstick. I'd like to lick Jay's head, he shaved it today. His dreadlocks are all fuzzy icky though. I mean they're fabulous, but just a little... bleh. He put lotion on his scalp. Grody."

MOTHERFUCKER. and then alex... chris broke her fucking heart by doing this. he could be in juvi until he's fucking 18. 

i put icyhot cream on my wrist today and it helped when i was playing bass. it hurts so much and when i rotate it, it snaps and crackles like fucking rice crispies.

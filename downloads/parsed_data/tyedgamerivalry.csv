junior year was a really good one.
next year will be sweet too, [[especially since i am senior class president!]] it's just gonna be hard without all of my friends who are going away to school but i'm trying hard not to sweat it cause i strongly believe that nothings gonna change between all of us and we're still all gonna see eachother all the time. tonight was fun hanging out with everybody. good way to start off my summer.

then on saturday mikey marissa and i went to the somerset patriots game and they won, some guy hit a grand slam, and some other guy won 10,000 bucks. sweet. except i entered that contest and im still broke.

natalie too don't leave me so much you stupid beachwhore
my two favorite people are going to be gone for half of the summer.

i guess it's payback for leaving everyone else for weeks at a time the past 5 summers

i really really really hope this summer doesn't suck. most of the rest of the goof troops should be staying here with me this summer and i'll probably go on some sort of vacation too since i haven't in a bashillion years. 

and arghhhhhhh SENIORS PLEASE, PLEEAASSE DONT GRADUATE.
mikey got his first acceptance letter to college. he's leaving me too.

and next year erin gretta jamie alli heather shannon alt paul mark alex michelle reg and mat will be seniors. SENIORS. and then they'll leave. thank gosh for nat and dave cause otherwise i'd have no friends left.

the future scares me. everything that i'm so used to is all going to be gone in a matter of two years.
and everything that i'm so used to was so fucking perfect.

but i need to leave here asap too.

"event","less then 24 hours and it's another one.
and now that i think about it, this year was pretty amazing
i really found out a lot more about who i really am
and even though i went through two pretty shitty relationships and zero good ones this year(or ever, for that matter)
they both just kinda made me realize that fuck that i dont need a boyfriend
cause i have the greatest friends anyone could ever fucking ask for
and we go on giant orgy filled dates together like to the movies and movie nights and backyard/vermuele campouts and bowling and applebees and BAJA FRESH and hot tubbing and coed sleepovers and ice skating and massacres of flelephants etc.
and i loved this year so much.
and tonight dave came over and we watched old school episodes of clarissa explains it all and talked about how we miss our childhoods
cause man they were bangin 
and i was just kinda thinking
as we grow up
we all learn 
that things change
and it's pretty sweet that some of us have been tight since 2nd grade or 6th grade or 8th grade
and it really sucks that some of those friendships just kinda discontinued or got all fucked or your best friend moved away
but no matter how much shit changes
there will always be that one set of people
who i can call at 3 in the morning because i've been overthinking
or that will be the first to call me when they find out im feeling sad
and be there to go out when everyone else deserted you on a friday night
and that one set of people no matter how far they go 
you know they're always one call away
and that they'll never leave
or at least i know that

and well things change. and you look back and remember how great things USED to be cause everything was so perfect. and then high school happened and everyone got lost for a second and once we all found ourselves some things just weren't the same
and you know what that sucks. and we all hate change sometimes
hell i always talk about how i remember mikes first day of kindergarten and how i cryed cause i didnt want him to without me
and now tomorrow it'll be year 2006
and 6 months from now he'll graduate
and he'll go to college
and everything will change again and next year everything will be different
and in 2007, all of my best friends are going to graduate and be gone
and everything will change again
and we'll still think about recess and the white rock at east end and all the nights spent there and at vermuele playing manhunt and getting chased away and how we don't do those things anymore really
cause we grew up 
and shit changed
but the one constant
will always be my best friends. 
no matter what happens, ill be there for them and they'll be there for me.
and no matter how much things change
it doesn't always get worse
cause i love my life, my family, and my friends
more then i can even put into words
i loved it ten years ago 
and i'll love it in ten more
and whatever obstacles come or changes come about, i'm ready
so for everything that you've taught me 
thank you, 2005."

South Plainfield-28.
greatest high school football game i've ever seen. and it's so sad now that it's all over for this year and for the seniors. North will <b>ALWAYS</b> be on top.

tomorrow starts preseason for wrestling. george foreman grill chicken + tangerines + seltzer = only food in my house for the next 4 months. i'm so excited for this season but it's all happening way too fast. 

i won't be here this weekend and that kinda sucks a lot =[

Happy Tday y'all <3"

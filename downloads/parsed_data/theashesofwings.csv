What has happened since i last updated...

Well i was having a good week until work went nuts on me. I have two of the other managers going all crazy on me. Its so stupid i swear, nothing i do is good enough for them. I do and do for there sorry asses and the second i need something done for me its fuck you get your ass in here. And then the both have the nerve to act as if nothing in the world has happened. Yet our district manager is coming on Thursday and 'rather talk to you in person about that Crystal so bring all your info on in then'. There both up to something but you know what i dont care. It was worth it. Your always worth it. Plus im looking for a new better job anyway. 


Okay along with that my dog ended up putting my tooth thru my lip. So i have this cut and blue purple bruse on my bottom lip. Its going away its just taking a while to do so. People are looking at me at work, customers, and its kind of unsettling. I think they think something else of it and take pity on me. I dont know it just bothers me.

I also think im getting sick. My nose is so stopped up and im starting to cough. And on top of that my nose keeps bleeding for no reason. 

Then theres my car. I love my car to death but i think shes about ready to die. Which i cant afford. I get to leave her with my mechanic for who knows how many days on Thursday. Thank god im off that day. 

And to top it all off im taking my finals this week. Why not just pile it all on at once what the hell, as if life doesnt suck enough right now. Grr. Oh wait AND im trying to pay for classes with like no money.....

I dont know i just wish i could talk to you right now...oh well you cant always get what you want right. Oh well i guess im going to bed. 

You know i swear, its gotten bigger...."

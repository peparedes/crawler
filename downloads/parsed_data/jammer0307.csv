Had a nice drive back, even though a deer scared the shit out of me when it hopped out of the woods onto the highway.   I had a nice surprise waiting when I got back....the card Red sent for my birthday.  It was funny and actually a lot like her lj posts so I had a good chuckle.

I didn't kill my family, although I may have wanted to at one point.  Now on to finishing the semester and going home for the summer!"

"event","Ok, trying again.  My first version of this didn't work.

I'm sitting here in the library, waiting until five, so I can go and earn my keep here at MSU.  (In other words, its part of my scholarship requirements)  I have to call prospective students.

I had an exam earlier.  Who the hell gives exams two days after Spring Break??!!!  I hope I did ok.

Tomorrow is St. Patrick's Day, my favorite holiday apart from Christmas.  I'm Irish so it goes without saying.  It'll be easy to wear green, although I should be wearing orange.  When I was a little kid I was told to wear orange on St. Patrick's Day because I wasn't Catholic.  So I just do.  But I wear something green as well to avoid getting pinched.

So I'm going to end with my favorite Irish blessing:

May God grant you many years to live,
For sure He must be knowing
The earth has angels all too few
And heaven is overflowing."

I also am in the planning stages for a new fic that won't just leave me alone.  So that's next, then I'm planning to use more of Jammer's plot bunny list.  And after that I'll get to work on the drsclub challenge.

I have a paper due tomorrow and one on Monday.  They are both done, just need a little revison and then printed off.

I got an interview on Valentine's Day for a job for next year.  Cross your fingers, gals.  I really need this job.

I'm kind of sick.  I feel lethargic, I feel cold 75% of the time, and my headache comes and goes.  The headache is a combo of my sinuses and the fact that the lenses in my glasses are out of date.  

Oh and get this: A reporter from the *New York fricken Times* is going to be in my hometown this weekend.  He's going to cover the big snowmobile race that's going on this weekend.  I can't believe it!  The New York Times!"

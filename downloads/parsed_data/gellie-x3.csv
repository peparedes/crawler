"event","it's very very very stupid at times... and so far, for me, it's been stupid for the last year or so. i mean <b>horrible</b>. =( and I hate just sitting here complaining about it, but the things that I want are completely unattainable. tomorrow i'm going to Rehobeth, Delaware... so that will be kind of fun. 

I don't know.

I'm sad..."

"event","Wow. Like 5 times within 48 hours people have come to me saying ""I have a boyfriend! or I have a girlfriend!"" and it only reminds me of how lonely I am. and I'm listening to songs that help me to realize how alone I am. But I'll try to focus on other things except for being involved right now. I have no idea where to meet guys anyway... the club? e.e clubs are stupid and any guy I find in some <i>club</i> will more than likely be a loser. School was always a good place to find guys, but me being the dumbass that I am, left fucking school. I guess I will wait until I get to college and stuff, that'll be good, the guys there will probably think i'm stupid too. But it's worth a shot :) and I can't wait."

"event","well it's another day, nothing special happening. i got into a big fight with my mom again last night. she loves to talk about me behind my back and everytime i try to explain to her what i am going through and how i am feeling she always tries to turn it back on <b>her</b> and about how she feels <b>worse</b>. that's very stupid because if she's going through anything it's all her fault. she's 40 years old and can control her destiny somewhat. on the other hand i am 17. oh well, 7 more months and i'm gone!!! right now the song i'm listening to is Natalie Imbruglia's- <b>Torn</b>. The very lyrics of the chorus are...

<b>Nothings fine,
I'm torn</b>
I'm all out of faith
This is how it feels...
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor.

Illusion never changed into something real... (etc.)

I love that part ""illusion never changed into something real"" i'm guessing it means something like, dreams never come true, or my dreams never came true... something along those lines. All of that is true for me. I guess i'm kind of sad right now, for my own personal reasons, i never open up to anyone and let them in on what i am feeling. the only one i ever did open up to was Alex, and he's gone now so yeah.

I feel so alone. =\"

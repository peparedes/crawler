I've been thinking about my friends both old and new lately and there's ome people that I wish i had never lost touch with and others that I would give anything to have back in my life.

I've been blessed with amazing friends surrounding me, they may not physically be around me but they are there.  In pictures, e-mails, phone calls, text messages and visits.

There's that old phrase 'If you love it, let it go, if it was meant to be yours it will come back'  Some of these friends I love so much, but maybe they were only in my life for that reason or that season and not a lifetime like the phrase says....Who knows?

All i know is that I miss all of them....we'll see what happens....Maybe we'll meet up again one day...until then....i have the memories...."

"event","So today i went for a walk by the lake....there's this memorial to a local and all those who died in the WTC attacks on Sept 11, 2001.  I took my new camera to take photos by the lake and of the memorial. I've seen it before, but today...something struck me....

It struck me just how much I've seen in my lifetime....There's been some major world events in the past 23 years....Major ones...Today was an eye opening experience, cause i stepped outside of myself and i saw the memorial through my camera lens...and it's a whole different world and all new emotions that i get when i take pictures...

Through my camera, i am able to step outside of myself and i see the world differently.....maybe that's why i love it so much....it's more pure and true when I take my own personal emotions and thoughts out of it...that's what draws me to it...seeing the world in a new light...it's a great feeling....

I hope everyone can find something that provides them the outlet to see the world in a pure and true way...maybe the world would be a different place if we all had something like that....."

"event","So quick recap.....VEGAS was amazing....

I was greeted at the airport by my friend David who brought me flowers! What a way to start a trip...i knew this was gonna be a great week.....

The week was spent pretty much just walking around Vegas and gettin pictures everywhere I could think of.  There was so much to see and do...i can't even form enough descriptives to explain it....

Sunday was the big day...since it was my birthday the boys (Joel and David--the ones i went to visit) took me to breakfast, then to the mall --joel's gift to me was taking me shopping at the GAP--he's a manager at a GAP (he bought me a skirt and 4 tops), then we went to see Cirque Du Soleil's Mystere (we sat like 7th row), then we went to Cheesecake Factory for dinner and for dessert got a slice of my favorite Tiramisu cheesecake and the boys sang to me--it was a great day!! I had so much fun....

We went out clubbing twice...but i'm not much for the club scene so i didn't love that...but we got to see almost all of the hotels and i had a blast just walking around......

my last night there Joel was working, so David took me to the top of Stratosphere and we went to the observatory which is on the 108 floor and looked out over the Vegas strip...it was amazing....

we did a lot but it's hard to remember everything.....the definite highlights of the trip:

Seeing David and most especially seeing Joel
The Bellagio Hotel & Casino (i think it's my favorite)
The Bellagio Conservatory
Cirque Du Soliel
My whole birthday
Finally meeting some of Joel's friends
The Fashion Show Mall (they have a catwalk that rises out of the floor and the stores hold fashion shows--wow!)
Seeing a Fendi store, a La Perla, Armani, Louis Vuitton, etc etc (things i usually only see/hear on tv)
Everything was a highlight!!!

I cannot wait to go back!!! So much fun.....i think i'mma go out to visit again next year...whoo hoo...

and my photos...my photos are online 

they can be found at:

http://photos.yahoo.com/reignbeau18 

they're in the album titled LAS VEGAS (I know i got real creative there) there's other albums if you wanna look. Hope ya guys like 'em!!

OH YEAH!!! I forgot to mention...we went to Madame Tussaud's it's a wax museum...it was really cool but really freaky b/c they look SOOOOO lifelike....i refused to get a picture by any of them b/c they freaked me out so bad....but if i go again i'm so gonna get some pictures by them....

It was an amazing trip...and it only solidified in my mind how absolutely amazing my friends are and how very lucky I am to have them...."

"event","So now that I have my nifty new scanner...i got all my pictures from my trip...so be prepared...here's the story of what happened.....

I'm not gonna bore you with airport stories and whatnot...just the actual trip...

So i arrived in Shreveport around 11pm and Nicole was waiting at the airport with her friend Michael. I had never met Michael and hadn't seen Nicole in like 8 months...so it was fun to chat while we waited for my luggage.....Nicole and I headed back to her house and saw her parents (who were waiting for us--how sweet)...We talked for a little while but I was beat --I had been up since about 7:30 EST that morning and it was now like 1230pm EST (though b/c of the hour time change the clock only said 1130pm!) So we headed off to bed after making plans to meet up for lunch the next afternoon.....

Well Friday morning came and Nicole had to work, so her sister Jacky came home from school (she goes to NSU which is like an hr or so away from nicole's house) and picked me up and we went to meet Nicole and her dad for lunch at Ralph and Kakoo's (I tried crawfish for the very first time and it was good!). After lunch Jacky and I went back to the house and nicole and her dad went back to work. Jacky and I just hung around the house watching tv and checking e-mail. Then everyone got home from work and we headed out for the Mudbugs Hockey Game. The Shreveport-Bossier City Mudbugs are the local hockey team for the Central Hockey League. Nicole and her sister are season ticket holders and the whole family is part of the booster club. We went to the game and it was AMAZING. First of all, their seats are great, first row right behind the player's family/friends ice side seats. WOW...the game was amazing as well....they won a 4-3 victory with 20 seconds left against their biggest rival.....I also met the people they sit next to and they invited us to join them for the parade the next day...they were such awesome people and very interested in learning about me and where i was from....very very welcoming--it was great....That night was Military Appreciation Night so the team wore special jerseys and then auctioned them off right after the game....they ended up doing the auction right in front of us....WOW....

After the game, Nicole and I headed out to the Hollywood Casino to meet up with Michael and Brandon (nicole's friends)...brandon brought some of his friends with him...they were nice...the one jumped down my throat about the confederacy and called me a yankee...i was like 'FYI the war is over..' i had never experienced someone that was sooo passionate about the confederacy before....it was crazy but we had a good night and had dinner at the Hollywood Diner and then walked around town for a little while....

So we get home at like 3 or 4am and have to go to sleep b/c Saturday is the Shreveport Krewe of Centaur Mardi Gras Parade...So we slept in till like 930 or 10am and them got up and got dressed...we headed out to buy some souvenirs for my family first and then had to head out for the parade...we met up with Ken and his family (the family from the hockey game) and they had bbq's set up and drinks and food and we had an all around great time...it was so cool just to see everyone hanging out...we don't have a lot of that kinda stuff here in NJ...Ken and his family only knows nicole and her family from the hockey games but they were inviting us to join them for the parade and everything...so cool...

after the parade we headed to the Centurytel Center cause there was another hockey game....they won this one too in a shootout....heart pounding game let me tell you....

Now Nicole and I were talking about finding some Mudbug souvenir for me...but we weren't sure what to get...ken heard us talking and spoke with one of the team's people and ended up getting me a puck that they had used in the game for a souvenir...how awesome is that!

after the game the family headed to Tony Roma's to eat and the Nicole and I headed to meet Michael at the Horseshoe Casino and we walked around there for awhile....then we headed home and Nicole and I sat up and talked till like 330am talking...

Sunday Morning around 545-6am, Nicole, her dad and I headed for New Orleans for another Mardi Gras parade, but this one was special cause our friend Casey was a maid in the parade and her mom was the Queen of the parade....It was a long drive but we made it there, we got to see Casey at her house, then we went and saw the floats gettin ready and even got to go on a float to see what it's like...it was awesome....her mom had actually gotten us passes so we got to sit in the King's Grandstand...which is reserved for family and friends of the King and Queen of the parade.....Sweet....

After the parade we were starved so we went to get dinner down by Bourbon Street....we actually ate at the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co...and it was soo good and so much fun...after dinner we walked down Bourbon Street...we then went and got Beignets at Cafe Du Monde (it's supposedly a famous french marketplace) and hot chocolate....

We passed this gorgeous cathedral, St Charles I think it was called...it was so pretty and then we went to see the Mississippi River since I had never seen it..

Then it was time to head back to Shreveport, we got there at like 230-3am and Nicole and her dad had to work Monday Morning and I was supposed to leave, but i had extended my trip to Wed!

Monday morning I slept late and got read cause we were going to a Mardi Gras Dinner/Dance hosted by the Mudbugs Booster Club...

Then nicole, her dad and I headed out....it was nice, we were seated with Jason Basile, a hockey player and Steve Mears, the announcer for the team...I didn't actually get to meet either of them b/c the other ladies at our table monopolized their time....we didn't stay long cause it was kinda boring...but Nicole and I headed out to meet Michael at the Horseshoe and we got some food and had a great time.....

Tuesday was my last day and we just wanted to hang out...so we went to the Mudbug Radio Show and got dinner at the place that it's held and then went back to Nicoles to just hangout....Michael joined us to hang out at Nicole's....

So that night when Nicole and I said goodnight it was also goodbye b/c her mom was driving me to the airport in the morning....so when i woke up her mom and i were talking and i was saying how i was slightly disappointed cause i hadn't met anyone with the mudbugs...I wanted to meet someone not just see them from afar and it just never seemed to work out...so what did she do....

She drove to CenturyTel arena and we met Steve, the announcer. Nicole was friendly with him but he had never met her mom before...We just showed up in the office and she asked if he was in, when he came out she explained i was from NJ and i hadn't had a chance to meet and get a picture with a mudbug...would he fulfill this wish of mine?....YES HE WOULD!!

So i got my picture with Steve and we talked for a few mins and then we had to leave cause I had a plane to catch...but i got my picture with a Mudbug!

It was so much fun and I got to see and do so much!! I'm not gonna bore you with airport stories but i got delayed and was stuck in the Atlanta airport for 4 hours! OY...but i made it home safely and had a wonderful time....

"event","Well usually i'd delve into the drama that is my life or about some funny situation, or what has happened with my roomies and i...but that's so....normal, right? well right now, i'm not sure what's normal and what's not, so i'mma do my best here....

the roomie from hell moved out, but left all her crap for us to take care of....we had to return the computer to the education office (NOTE: she had it for 5 weeks and you're only supposed to have it for 2 days at a time), throw out a bunch of stuff that she left behind (with Housing's permission), and we cleaned this apt like mad the day after she moved out....it was interesting to say the least. It's all over now though....

Work has been ok...i'm having a great time and i love most of my co-Cast Members....not to mention the fact that one of them is hot! LOL...we're doing a lot with the college program and gettin involved...fun fun stuff.

now as for today...exactly one year ago i was in the exact same place....Walt Disney World.  I was, eerily enough, doing the exact same thing, waking up from a  night of slumber preparing to go about my day.  Last year, I watched on the tv as the area surrounding the place i call home crumbled.  I did this while at work at the Port Orleans resort (i got called in). I was unable to reach my family until about 8:30pm that night.  When i finally did, we cried and cried, i was still at work but i didn't care.

This year, i turned on the tv in hopes of forgetting, if only for a brief while, what has happened this past year, all over the tv was 9-11, 2002 rememberances. I called my mama crying, just b/c i needed to hear her voice and tell my family i loved them, she understood and comforted me.  She knew that i was being affected by everything, she said everyone was.

NJ may be my home, but NY is a part of that home. I've traveled into NY my whole life, 5 or 6 years ago i was at the WTC. I have a picture to prove it.  To look at the picture now is almost like looking at a ghost, you see it but you can't believe it.  I don't like to dwell on it, but sometimes you can't help it. Today was my day to remember in my own way, without all the hoopla that the tv, radio and even the world provided. It was a time to try to move on and forget, or at least to place it in the back of our minds. We must move on, at our own pace.

Today is the day that thousands of angels entered their angelic existence and those left behind felt the tears of heaven.  For all those who worked at Ground Zero, thank you. You are angels here on Earth."

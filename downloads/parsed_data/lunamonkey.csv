Movie in a Sentence: Zombies Zombies Zombies

Plot: A group of strangers find themselves hiding in a farmhouse after a zombie attack. They fight to find a way to get to safety, and to stay alive.

Review: While this movie was made more than 40 years ago, I think it still stands to test of time. What starts as a harmless visit to a cemetery to lay a wreath on a dear departed's grave, turns into a fight for survival against blood thirsty, flesh craving zombies. Filmed in black and white, though some versions were later painted with color, this film does a fine job for it's time. 

The special effects aren't what a modern audience would be use to, but then, it doesn't need anything too graphic. With a loose plot about a satellite crashing to earth with strange radiation, the group of strangers have to find a way to work together if they are going to survive.

Looking back through time, I think the best thing about this movie is it's leading man. Given the race riots that were happening in certain parts of the US at the time, I feel it was a brave choice my Romero to use a African American to be not only the leading man, but in many scenes to be the voice of reason. 

As the cast begin to drop off like flies, and the house they are in ransacked by zombies, the survivors are put to the test. Though the zombie work at times is conflicting, it is a fine example of how good zombie movies should be made.

This movie spawned several sequels, and even a reboot, with modern day zombies as the fast movies flesh monsters we have come to know them today. It's easy to see by watching the movie why it is a cult classic.
With a refreshing plot and it's developments, this is a movie I hope stands the test of time to come, so it can be enjoyed by future generations, as I have enjoyed it.

Movie in a Sentence: Jaws meets Christine.

Plot: A human eating Alien/Monster terrorises the employees of a Multi-level underground smash repair center. Once the employees find out what is happening, they have to try to figure out how to destroy it, before it gets out or kills them all. 

Review: There are monster movies, and there are MONSTER movies. Movies that make you quake in your pants. This is not one of those movies. To be fair to the movie, it isn't terrible. There is plenty to admire about it. The script writers deserve a medal mainly for the marvelous scene chock full of exposition, where the lead characters think that the killer car could be a hybrid squid, or some variety of camouflaged predator. In the same scene we find out that our leading lady has a history of mental issues, our main tough guy has a history in the army, and the nerdy guy who kind of figures out what it is, got his information from a university degree.

Are there car chases? Yes. Are they any good? To a degree. They have done the best they can do considering all the action takes place underground in a concrete multistory complex. There are a few nice references to X-men, Jaws and Predator (If it bleeds we can kill it) to name a few, you know that at least the script writers knew what they were creating, and allowed themselves to have some fun. If I had one issue with it, it would be all the references to hunting that happen throughout the movie. We get it, one of the guys has hunted before. Give it a rest.

There is some level of suspension of belief you have to go into this movie with. For example, they're trapped because there is 3 padlocks on the main exit to get them all out. Some may say that it's a little weak considering the amount of tools that are at their disposal in a garage of that size. And one might suspect that a police impound garage, would have some police officers in it. But despite the level of disbelief you have to have for the movie, I think this one isn't too terrible. Yes the actors aren't hollywood celebs, and yes, some more work could have been put into the script and plot, but who goes to a horror film for the plot or script? 

Visually the movie is good, with our beast transforming throughout the film, giving us several good scenes where we see it partially for what it is, building anticipation for the Reel 3 reveal. There are some plot holes that seem to want to link to a sequel/prequel, which I dare say somebody is already working on in some capacity, and truth be told, I would probably watch them if there was nothing better to do. So long as they have less references to hunting.

Movie in a Sentence: Planet of the apes, without the apes, but with zombies.

Plot: The Lost Future is set in a post apocalyptic world, where man has reverted back to caveman ways. The future is threatened by Mutants, whose mere presence can turn normal humans into a mutant kin. A few lone adventures set out to try to find aide, and find a mythical ""Yellow Powder"" that can stop the mutant infection from spreading. In doing so they realise that their world is much bigger and more dangerous than they could have imagined.

Review: An interesting twist on the Zombie genre, with Sean Bean playing the role of the wise stranger who sets the adventurers on the right path. Visually the movie is quite good, with special effects, costumes and settings that compliment the action of the movie.

The plot, while sometimes predictable, is enough to keep the movie flowing and developed enough to make it seem like the creators actually put some thought into what they were creating. If the movie has a flaw, it is the love story that flows through it, with our young hero in love with another man's girl.

While the movie does have a so called ""bad guy"", it doesn't have any overt moral stories like other movies. This isn't about the evils of our current ways, or how we are killing the planet and if only the people of the past were smarter, no this movie simply shows the world from the point of view of the people of the time, and has little to no introspection about how the world came to be as it is now, and I think this makes it a stronger movie for it.

Does the hero save the day? Is humanity granted one more chance of survival? Does Sean Bean live through the movie? To answer these questions you will have to watch the movie yourself, I will not reveal them here. Save to say that this is a good movie to kill some time, and is better than other so called B-Grade movies I've seen in recent times.

Let's sort the buyers from the spyers, the needy from the greedy, and those who trust me from the ones who don't, because if you can't see value here today, you're not up here shopping. You're up here shoplifting. You see these goods? Never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite. Fanny by the gaslight. Take a bag, c'mon take a bag. I took a bag home last night. Cost me a lot more than ten pound, I can tell you. Anyone like jewelry? Look at that one there. Handmade in Italy, hand-stolen in Stepney. It's as long as my arm. I wish it was as long as something else. Don't think because these boxes are sealed up, they're empty. The only man who sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you lot today, I'd make more money with me measuring tape""

For those who don't recognise the quote, it comes from my movie of the day:

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoZ2kTlwKTk"">Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</a>

Released in 1998, the hay day of my high school going youth, the best thing a movie lover like myself could do was to be able to quote a movie perfectly. Especially if someone disagreed with you, and you could prove them wrong. And what movie would be more appealing to a group of young men, than a movie about a group of young men (apart that is than a movie about a group of your women, but that's a topic for another day).

Lock Stock is a movie based on the adventure of a lifetime for four friends looking to make a big score to get their lives sorted. Set in the grizzly streets of London, the boys dabble a little further than they expected to one day, and find themselves owing a fairly serious gangster quite a sum of money, with little to no avenues to get the money to pay him back. With a story line more twisted than a length of rope, it goes to show how good Guy Ritchie was in his hayday. I say 'was' as apart from the recent adaptation of Sherlock Holmes, I don't think his recent films have been as good as Lock Stock.

There was a time in my youth, when I could quote this movie from start to finish. This isn't a boast. I honestly could accurately quote the movie from start to finish, and would often include the actions (as sometimes I get a little carried away). This isn't because I have a good memory, as to be honest I think I've forgotten more than I can remember. No, this was good old fashioned repetition. Much like my father told me of how he learned lessons at school, his teacher would make him write the lesson over and over in his books, I watched this film again and again, and again, and again , and again... 

I would say that without exaggeration that I have saw this film more than 100 times in a year (roughly once every 3 days if you're keeping track). The soundtrack to this film for a time was the soundtrack to my life. As was always a problem of mine, I didn't experience a film, I lived it. And Lock Stock for a time was my be all and end all... Ah the memories."

When thinking of my past (in relation to movies, as after all, that's what I'm here for) my mind doesn't jump to trips to the cinema like I'm told most people's minds do. I remember a small lounge room, my spot on the floor not 3 feet away from the television, an old TV stand with the fake wood-grain vinyl peeling from the corners, and the movie of the day:

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-P6p86px6U"">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a>

It was a simpler time for me. I was young and I was just stating to learn the social skills that would see me through the remainder of my young adult life, and what better role model could a young impressionable child ask for than a cocky, self assured, confident hooligan who skipped class to enjoy life to the utmost?

Matthew Broderick, the lead character in this fine film, to me was like the hero's of old. Not unlike Errol Flynn's version of Robin Hood, Ferris Bueller commanded every room he entered and no matter how the forces of evil attempted to capture him, even space itself seemed to let Ferris get away with his schemes (like running through multiple people's back yards to get home in time not to get caught. You try running through people's back yards today, and just see how long it takes someone to call the cops).

This movie showed a young man, why it was he wanted to rebel and go against the set rules of life. Not in a way that hurt anybody else, as if nothing else Ferris thought of his friends as much or in cases more than he thought of himself. His main influence in his ""day off"" is to make sure that Cameron has a good day, despite what Cameron may want for himself, or what Cameron may think he wants for himself.

Unlike the coming of age films that I had seen up until this point (The Breakfast Club, and movies of their ilk) Ferris Bueller's Day Off didn't preach, didn't attempt to get me to lead a better life, didn't seem to be a coming of age film which I think makes me like it all the more."

""We choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hard."" ""I have a dream."" ""They may take out lives, but they will never take our freedom.""

There are quotes to make us happy, and sad, and pensive, and angry. Quotes can move mountains and diverge rivers. It was one simple statement by then President JFK, that put a man on the moon. Words have power, and so do inspirational scenes in movies. But the movie I'm talking about today isn't a big budget action film. It's not a romantic heart-breaker, nor is it a period drama using political commentary of today values. You may guess it from the quote, which links back to today's topic ""A film that reminds you of somewhere"".

""It's not a house, it' a home. Filled with people who love each other. But that doesn't seem to matter as much as a big fucking driveway.""

Yes, my film of today is: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM-GVRvsZrA"">The Castle</a>.

For those who haven't seen it, (not that I'm expecting many people in this category reading my blog) <i>The Castle</i> is about one family's struggle against the ever growing arm of progress, as a near by airport compulsorily acquired the land their house is sitting on to expand. A true tale of the iconic ""Aussie Battler"", the fight goes as high as one can in Australian Parliment, the High Court. It's a delightful Australian comedy, with great acting (including the now very famous Eric Bana as a kick boxing instructor). <i>The Castle</i> essentially is a story about a man keeping his family together, by any means possible.

And how does this film make you think of somewhere I hear you asking? (Not literally, cause that would imply that you are sitting next to me while I write this, and I'm 99% sure that you aren't) It reminds me of two places. My family home in Bundoora, and our holiday spot Yarrawonga.

My family home is no more and I've left the nest to spread my wings, and th holiday home got sold on, to bring new happy memories to another family. But they both will always hold a special place in my heart."

"event","Followers of mine (all three of you) will know that 2 years ago I lost my mother to a battle with cancer. She was a fine woman; warm and caring, with very few vices. One of those vices however was the movie which is the topic of today's rant:

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqQSBqsrsEI"">Shirley Valentine</a>

<i>Shirley Valentine</i> is like a mid life crisis movie for women my mother's age. The movie was released in the late 80's, and I think that time of my mother's life was the right time for this movie to be engrained into her psyche.

<i>Shirley Valentine</i> follows the life of a middle class housewife, who is bored of the regime she has found herself in, and constantly re-lives her life through her memories of what she was like before she donned the metaphorical housecoat and became a mother and housewife.

Shirley herself opens up to us through flashbacks and conversations with her Wall (no, I didn't type that wrong. She talks to the Wall... Honest!). She lets you into the humdrum life of a suburban housewife, who has no children left in the roost and only a husband of very simple pleasures to co-exist with.

So, after reaching her breaking point, Shirley packs her bags and trips off to Greece for the holiday of a lifetime. <i>Shirley Valentine</i> feeds into that feeling deep down inside everyone who thinks back to what life was like before, or what they had imagined their life to be in years to come, and finding the current display of existence lacking.

I recently re-watched this movie, in honour of my mother, and found myself shocked at the amount of language and nudity in the movie. Please bear in mind that I grew up watching this movie while my mother (the woman who raised me and didn't like modern films because they were too rude and full of sex) did housework with id on in the background. I'm not sure if it was the age I was, where I simply didn't register adult things like bad language or nudity, or whether it was the copy of the tape we had (which most likely was taped off the television, back in the days when VHS was king) but during the latest re-watching, I was gobsmacked at the language and nudity throughout the movie. There is something surreal when someone who could stand in for your mother swears like a sailor, then laughs about the reactions she gets.

I've grown up with <i>Shirley Valentine</i> in my life. I've grown up talking to the Wall in times of frustration when no one else would listen. I've grown up... wow.. I've <i>grown up</i>. Go figure..."

You may watch a movie to cry, or to help deal with difficult issues, but I don't think anyone actually puts on a movie to make themselves feel worse. So, in true fashion, I'm altering the criteria slightly on this one. Therefore, the movie that I will watch, even though it makes me feel sad is""

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX8XEXmhHss"">The Bucket List</a>

Regular readers of my blog will no doubt know by now that my mother recently passed away due to cancer. This happened roughly the same time that this movie hit the big screen, so for obvious reasons, I didn't see this film for some time after it's initial release.

<i>The Bucket List</i> tells the tale of two people thrust together by fate to have the same cancerous condition, in the same hospital. The term 'strange bedfellows' would seem to apply if it wasn't for that awful movie of the same name. Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholas set out to achieve all the thing that you mark on your internal list as trying to get to 'One Day', which never end up happening.

While this movie pulls at my heart strings in very real and severe ways (I'm fighting back tears as I type this), this movie also does a brilliant job of illustrating just how fragile life is, and (to quote my favourite proverb) to ""Live while you're alive, for you're a long time dead"".

Even though this movie makes me cry every time I watch it (and yes, I'm man enough to say that) I keep watching it, and I enjoy the positive message it drags out of the subject matter."

"event","There are many different moods one can watch a film in and for. Some movies make you feel good. Others make you think, or open up your horizons to a world of possibilities. But then there are times, when you just want to sit back, and watch something that makes you feel good. For me, whenever I want to do this I look to the film of my youth, and the film I'm slating in this position today is:

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWSfwgXCiXA&feature=related"">Major League</a>

Set in the late 80's, a struggling baseball team fights poor selections, crappy equipment and a devil of a owner, to try to win the pennant. Something that hasn't happened in nearly 80 years.

While this is a trip down memory lane for me (I was practically raised on the movie) younger views might be shocked to see Charlie Sheen (before Tiger Blood Winning), Wesley Snipes, Tom Berringer, to name a few of the now household names in this movie (OK, maybe not Tom Berringer, but ask your dad about him, he'll know). The Cleveland Indians take on the role of the ultimate underdog, as Management <i>want</i> the team to lose, so they sign up a team of ""has been's and never will be's"".

And throughout the movie, there is a never say die mentality that is so infectious that come the third act, you can't help but cheer for the Indians as they attempt to do the impossible. It was because of this movie that I attempted to follow the Indians, but unfortunately in real life Baseball is one of the slowest and most boring games in the world to watch. But if anyone asks me, I follow the Indians (Much like I follow Arsenal under similar movie circumstances, but that's a blog for another time).

Leaving aside the 2 sequels (though Major League 2 is worth a watch, to see the downfall of the franchise), Major League is a nice dose of escapism for a mind too weary from our modern world."

So for today's selection I could had the Justin Beiber Movie... or the Miley Cyrus Movie, or any of another hundred movies that I personally would not piss on if they were on fire. However, I am making this films I've 'seen'. And in saying that, I'm breaking it with my least favourite movie:

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFWnZW3esb8"">Last Days</a>

This movie, as is my understanding, is not a ""what if?"" look at the last days of Nirvana front man (and legend) Kurt C, but in fact is a movie about someone 'like' Kurt in his final days before killing himself.

That alone should have set off warning bells in my head before I attempted to watch this. However, I entered the cinema without any knowledge of what the movie was about (something I do regularly, and usually recommend highly).

I found this movie to be so mind numbingly boring, I left the cinema and got a souvlaki. Yes people, I actually walked out of the cinema during a film, something I NEVER do. I've even sat through Blair Witch 2 at the cinemas. But with this I simply could not sit there any longer. It seemed like there was no script, plot, or any real characters to speak of. Rather just a group of people in a run down house, fucking about.

And I could forgive that if that is what the movie is meant to be. But it's not. It's directed by Hollywood Heavyweight Gus Van Sant, director of such brilliant movies as ""Milk"", ""Finding Forrester"" and ""Good Will Hunting"". <i>Last Days</i> has been touted as being a great artistic piece, filled with comedic black humour. The only funny part I saw was when a pair of Mormons came to the door, and it was the mormons cracking the jokes.

To this date it is the only movie I have ever walked out on before the end credits rolled... which puts it as my least favourite movie I've (almost) ever seen."

The Blues Brothers.

This movie was a stalpe in my house. Out of the 365 days in a year, I would say that it got played atleast 30 times. More when I got older and had a TV in my room.

I'm not sure whether it's the music, or the comedic greatness, or merely the oh so memorable lines; but this movie (and a few others) formed the backbone of my childhood.

For those who lived under a rock during the 80's, or in some cases may not have been born, let me clue you in as to the movie.

The movie starts with Joliet Jake being parolled from prison and being collected by his brother, Elwood Blues. Jake with Elwood's help attempts to put his life back together to a time before he was incarcerated, and along the way, aims to help an orphanange and to recover the glory days of ""The Blues Brothers Showband"". But, much like Brooks discovers in The Shawshank Redemption, The world has moved passed the style of music that Jake and Elwood specialise in. Or has it? Can one show save the day? Will the orphanage where Jake and Elwood were raised be saved? Can you drive a car through a mall?

For the answers to those questions, you will have to see the movie yourself. But along the way you will be treated to blues legends, along with legends in their field, like Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Tommy Lee Hooker; to name but a few.

In the 90's, there was a surge of ""Spring Break""/""Coming of Age"" films, were a rag tag bunch of misfits tear up places and in the end learn an important lesson about life. This movie is nothing like that at all. So I encourage you to put your feet up with some popcorn, and a coke, and follow the voyage of the Blues brothers.

Twas always such, and always such shall be... or so I thought. I thought that with the oncoming global warming effect, we would have to figure out how not to burn to a crisp in 45+ degree spells of 8 days or more.

What I didn't expect was to freeze my bollocks off in February. I walked out to my car this morning to see that it was frosted. FROSTED!

A frosted car in Feb might seem usual to those who read my journal in the Northern Hemisphere of great blue/green globe, but here in south I usually have to try not to burn my fingers on the damn steering wheel.

Seriously Summer! Ship up or I'm gonna complain to management.

---

In other news, Andie and I have been living together for 3 months now, and she hasn't killed me yet. Quite the achievement I think you'll agree. In the last month or so, we've decided to take the relationship to a new level. We've decided to buy new furniture.

We went shopping for a couch. HUGE I know.

It took us multiple trip to many many stores that sell couches, which included me sitting in over 100 different couches. The majority of which were ruled out due to a lack of what I call a ""Cush"" factor. The cush factor isn't something that's hard to describe. When you sit on a couch, you want to slightly sink into it, but still feel supported enough to be comfortable. Sink too far and you have to fight your way out, making the couch TOO ""Cushy"". If you sit on it and it feels like you just slumped onto a concrete log, not only does you ass hate you, but if you manage to sit down without hurting yourself you usually lose feeling in an extremity before you're 20 minutes into whatever it is you're doing in the couch. Far too LOW a Cush factor. This means there is a happy middle, where there is enough Cush so that you feel comfortable, but not so much Cush that feel like you're being suffocated by a marshmallow.

So $2,400 later, we have a 3 seater leather couch, with 2 reclining ends, and a storage ottoman, which can double as a coffee table.

At to that the recent purchase of a new mattress at $2,500... and it's been an expensive month."

"event","Have been somewhat absent of late for several good reasons, and a few bad ones... like laziness.

In the last few weeks, I've moved house (almost complete, probably one trip left of moving stuff from my place). So I'm now a lot closer to work, and best of all, I've managed to trick my girlfriend to move in with me (Hypnosis. Works every time).

So I've been setting up internetz, gas and electricity; the usual fare for all those who have to move house. Including figuring out what to throw out (When did I buy this?) and packing memories.

And how does this relate to the title of this journal? Because my friends, I am now ... (pause for effect) ... a public transport user.

My average trip, which I'm sure will thrill my personal trainer, consists of a total of 30 minutes walking and a 15 minute train ride; and that's to get to work. I've got the same thing on my way home too.

A few things that I've noticed in my last few weeks of using the public transport system:

-Everyone owns a MP3 player/touch phone - What ever happened to the grand old days of reading a book, or just blankly staring out the window as the cityscape passed you by in a blur of green and concrete? Why has everyone sealed themselves into a little zone, basically flipping the finger to all and sundry while they sit cocooned in their own private universe? Well, I say private universe, but for some reason only known to themselves, they feel the need to share the terrible noise they are listening to. While I truly do not care about the hearing loss of complete strangers, I do care that I'm forced to listen to some white rapper talking about why he doesn't have enough bitches and ho's.

-People smell. I am not claiming that I am the cleanest person in the world. I shower daily, change my clothes regularly, and more often than not, you can find a food/beverage stain somewhere on my clothes. But I don't think I smell. So I find it hard to understand why every person on public transport stinks. And I'm not exaggerating here. Every time I've had someone sit next to me, they reek. I've taken to standing, rather than sitting, simply so I don't have anyone next to me. How in the modern world of aerosol's and shower gel can people smell so bad!

-Timetables. I've known from a young age that public transport timetables, to quote a popular pirate, is more like guidelines than actual rules. I know that the 10:10 train might not arrive until 10:15, or in extreme cases, even 10:20. I understand this, so why can't everyone else? why must people huff up and down the platform, constantly dialling that press button service that tells you where the train is, and when it will arrive. If you pressed it 2 minutes ago and it said it would be here in 5 minutes, why do you act shocked that they tell you it will be here in 3 minutes now? n the modern world of smart phones, there are aps you can download which will tell you how far away a train is. Download it to your iPhone, and stop pressing that fraking button.

-Food. This is less of a gripe, than a ""I can't believe it!"". For years upon years now, there have been vending machines at the larger train stations, where you can get a drink and a snack, at an exorbitant rate. And I've been fine with this. I have many many times over paid $4 for a cookie, that I use to get for $1.80 at my school tuck shop. But it seems that the companies who make these devices must have cottoned on to the fact that not everybody has $10 in change to get a drink and a snack. So in their wisdom, what have they done to combat this issue? Lower the prices? No. They now have places for you to swipe your credit card. FLM. I don't know about you, but I'm not going to get my credit card out on a public train station, just to buy a $4 bottle of Coke. Get nicked.

Love: A and me are celebrating our 3 year anniversary. Who would have thought that she'd be able to put up with me for 4 years, let alone with the madness of this last few years. We're also attempting to move out together before christmas. Something that I'm really hoping comes true, would be the only Christmas gift I need.

Work: ""Failnet"" as I shall refer to it, is where I inconsistently work due to a crappy rostering system. Looking for something full time, with a reasonable wage, somewhere between the city and the east. And yes, the vagueness is on purpose. At this moment, I'd be happy with any kind of desk job with a reasonable wage. Something more reliable than Failnet. Mind you, just about anywhere would be more reliable than Failnet.

Everything In Between: I've been working on improving my overall health and well being. I work out twice a week at the gym, and attempt to eat healthier. I've been less strict than when I started, and hence my results are slipping somewhat. However, as my budget for this week will consist of a) whatever i can find in the depths of my freezer, or b) living off of less that $5 per day till pay day (roughly 10 days from now) I'm not sure how my healthy eating habit will go.

I've seen a barrage of movie of late, including Inception, Salt, Scott Pilgrim vs The World, all of which I've been very happy with. I've been reading a book of late about BAD MOVIES, and ever since then all I've seen are good movies. Not sure if the two are connected or not.

I've been sleeping better of late, which is an improvement on the last quarter of a year. And who knows what the future will bring.

I've got a fair few weddings this month, which means I think, the first real drinking session I've had in quite a while will be on the horizon. Who knows, maybe I'll be able to control myself... :D

"event","I've found that over the last few years, I've started to get meloncoly around this time of year.

It comes to no suprise to most, as we are now 1 month away from my mother's birthday.

Of late things have been setting me off more than usual, but then I think about it and it's barely been 2 years. How do I yet nkow what ""usual"" is?

A few weeks ago I had a dream, and in this dream, my mum was still alive. And when I woke, it just about broke my heart to remember that she wouldn't be there.

Recently I couldn't sleep, and to remedy this I watched 2 movies. ""Shrink"" starring Kevin Spacey, and ""Charlie and Boots"" starring Paul Hogan, and the guy from ""Kenny"" whose name I can never remember.  EDIT: Shane Jacobson

While I found both movie to be excellent, and would recommend them to anyone who asked for a good movie to watch (albeit for different reasons, and to different people) I found myself feeling just about the worst I've felt since Mum's passing.

In ""Shrink"" (I'm attempting to avoid spoilers here, cause I really do recommend the movie) a young girl's mother dies, and she is sent to see a psychiartist to try to work through her feelings. The psychiatrist (played by Spacey) is in a world of pain himself, and as only hollywood can deliver, it is together that they find some semblance of a life after.

In ""Charlie and Boots"", Charlie's wife passes away, and his eldest son Boots (kenny) takes him away from his rut, to try to overcome the greif they are both feeling.

Both the movies are fantasticly written, and beautifully shot and acted (yes, even by Paul Hogan), and after watching both of them, I was in a funk, but I was essentially fine.

Tonight, For some unknown reason, I took a closer look at a pair of scissors that I have in my desk drawer. I noticed some strange marking on on side fo the blade, and twisting it to the light, I can catch the letters:

""P A N C H""

For some time, my mother worked at PANCH hospital as a nurse. It was where I was born, and I have no doubt, that she stole those scissors.

And now I have them...

And when I realised all these things. For a split second. I broke.

Perhaps it's just exhaustion, as I've not been sleeping well lately due to illness, and the remedy. OR it could just be greif, rearing it's head once more. I don't know. What I do know is that I shall forever miss my mother, and that I would trade almost anything in the world, for just one more day.

And in the dark times, when all looks blackest, I have one ray of light that I can escape to. I have one spot where I can hide.

I got to tell her that I loved her, and I got to say goodbye.

I got to tell her that I was going to try to be happy, and that I was going to look after myself.

And even though she was in tremendous pain, and on very heavy medication. I was able to make her smile... one last time.

Add on top of that the combination of ventolin and the steroids for my asthma, makes for one sleep deprived Monkey. (Hence the 4am posting)

The last time i did get to sleep, I had a dream with my mum in it. First one I've had in a long LONG time. And when I woke up, I missed her. that is to say that I always will miss her. But I just felt it more that morning than other mornings.

It could be cause it's coming up on her birthday again. Or it could just be that I'm in a funk at the moment, due to a crappy job, and being sick.

Who knows... Might try to get a few hours sleep before i have to get up for work...

"event","My birthday has come and past, and while the day itself passed without too much enthusiasm or enjoyment, I have managed to strive off the demons by holding festivities with friends, and I have a family hoot-n-anny this weekend.

I don't like my job, and I said that I would look for a new one when I got back from Thailand. It's been over a month now, and I haven't begun looking yet. I'm thinking of trying to become an electrician once more, but like everything I seem to do, I only ever get 90% of the way there.

While overseas, I felt for the first time, like a FAT man. I decided when I got back that I would do something about it and started eating right and exercising. So far I've lost 5kgs in a month. And don't get me wrong, I'm happy with that. But I had a blow out of a weekend, with another on the cards, so at the moment I'm wallowing in self pity and a little shame.

I got home from work tonight, and though I was in an amicable mood when I got home I ended up listening to / playing blues songs, and eating a little worse than I should have. Just in a funk I suppose. Tonight I got half way through writing a song, before I realised that it wasn't helping my mood like it usually does, and in fact it was only making it worse. So I stopped.

Lately I've been missing my mother more than usual. Not something every 27 year old man says on regular occasion. Not necessarily in a bad way, there's just been lots of little things that remind me of her. Like icing a birthday cake, or simply organising a party for my family.

I know that grief comes in stages, and that you never really get over it, it just sometimes gets easier. I just ... miss her, I suppose. I know she'd be happy with what I'm trying to do, and would scold me for not trying it earlier. I'm planning a new tattoo in her honour, which is something I'm sure she'd hate beyond reproach, but I find it mildly ironical. Assuming I ever decide on a design I'm happy with. Like the Hope Diamond, I'm always adjusting the image slightly, or slightly changing the font so it's just right.

One of the people I would classify as one of my closest friends hasn't made any contact with me about my birthday. And up until tonight I've been trying not to take this as a personal thing. This friend doesn't normally DO birthdays, and as such usually forgets them all together. I sent an invite to my party and didn't get a response. I didn't even get a text message wishing me a happy birthday. It didn't effect me until tonight. I think it must just be my mood at the moment.

2008 - 2009 has been a difficult time for me, but I've made it through (with a little help from my friends and family). 

As birthdays go, turning 26 really isn't one of the good ones. When you turn 18, it's all fun and excitement. 21 means a huge party, and again, more fun and excitement. Then you kind of lapse till you get to 25, which is seen as your first ""adult"" birthday (at least that's how I perceived it). But 26 is the beginning of the downhill slope. You're now that much closer to 30, which only a few years ago was VERY old. 26 is where it all goes south.

You start to feel older. You notice aches and pains that weren't there yesterday when you were 25. People actually seem to start to listen when you speak, rather than taking what you're saying for the blather that it actually is. You have now, officially, become an adult.

Next thing you know, BAM, you're 30. Where did that time go you ask as you're blowing out the candles on your 35th birthday cake. As you start to unwrap your presents you notice all the paper has little 40's on it. And at the end of the evening, after you've thanked everyone for coming to you're 50th, you take stock of the 60 years you've spent on this planet, and you ask yourself, ""Where did those 70 years go?"". Next thing you know, you're getting a letter from King Harry, and a local paper wants to do a spot on their oldest resident. And lets face it, most days you're lucky when you find the toilet in the middle of the night.

I know I may seem melodramatic, but 26 years have gone by too fast... All I have left are some good memories, some sad memories, and enough junk to sink a ship. 

To all those out there in reader-land who are older than me, you already understand what I'm saying, and those who are younger than me... you're time will come.

I would like to thank all the people who have wished me a happy birthday, save for the few who messaged me at 2am. 

Thank-you. (Steps off soap box)"

"event","So, as most of you know, my life of late has been terrible, save for a few saving graces.

I apologise for the size of this post, but it's what happens when you're away from the forum for a while.

Starting at the beginning, last september or so, Mum was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer, with secondary cancer on the liver. She tried a bout of Chemo with no effect.

Christmas Eve, I had an asthma attack that put me into the emergency room of Box Hill Hospital. At 9pm Christmas eve I was classified as stable, and I sent my loved ones home for rest and re-cooperation. At roughly 1:30am Christmas Day, I was put into a medicated coma which lasted into the new year.

On the 8th of January, I was allowed out of my hospital to see my mum, who was in hospital with complications relating to the cancer. I was out of hospital on the 13th, which gave me a few days to visit my mum before she passed away on the morning on the 19th.

The funeral and subsequent rehabilitation from my coma was a difficult time for me, but I made it through with my love and my family and my friends.

I've back at work for roughly 2 months now, working full time. 

Dad is in the motions of selling the family home, as he will be shifting to the country like he and mum had planned. I've organised to move out once more to my friends home in South Morang, meaning I will have a place to hang my hat.

So while I've been trying to keep my head high, I've also been supporting my father, who obviously has been hit hard by the loss of my mum.

I have been toying with the idea of seeing a therapist recently, for while I'm sure that I'm merely going through the normal grieving process, everybody can use some help form time to time.

To battle these items, these school holidays Andie and myself are getting away to Ballarat for a while, and then we will be tripping down to leongatha for a weekend.

"event","Back to the small coke cans, see my earlier post if you're confused... 

I was in a supermarket the other day, and they were having a promotional sale on a new range of coke cans, and being the consumer whore that I am, I bought some. It's a 10 pack of 200ml cans. So now, Coke has a 200ml can, a 250ml can (that you get on airplanes) a 375ml can and a 440ml can. But it doesn't stop there, they now have the 300ml bottle, the 440ml bottle, the 600ml bottle, the 1.25L bottle, the 2L bottle and during summer they normally have a 3L bottle too. Exactly how many different sized containers to we need? That's 10 different sized vessels. I can't speak for everybody, though there are times when I'd like to, but I simply can't see the practical application of all these sizes. Do they really think that i will purchase all the different sizes, on the off chance that I need refreshment of varying amounts? I'd have to have a fridge JUST for coke products. Or maybe that's what they want. But if that IS what they want, I have a question. What happens when I want the refreshment from only 500mls of coke? I can't open a 600ml bottle, cause the rest would go flat, and I can't open a 440ml product cause for a start it isn't enough, and secondly I would be stuck in an ever growing loop of indecision between the can and the bottle. I would have to combine vessels and have a 300ml bottle, and a 200ml can. Whatever happened to the days when If you wanted a drink, you got a cup, and filled it to whatever lever you required? Are people unable to do that anymore? 

Thinking about it though, the 200ml can can really only have two target consumer groups. The first is parents who don't want their kid to drink too much soft drink, which I support, but in that case I have an even simpler way to ensure they aren't drinking too much soft drink. Don't buy too much! Honestly, I saw an add for the 200ml cans the other night, and it had a mother talking about how she can now feel comfortable that her children can have a treat, but not overindulge. I say BOLLOCKS to you lady. The real reason that you want your kids to have the 200ml cans is because you are a trollop who likes torturing your kids. Sure you can have a can of coke you say, only to enjoy the look of bafflement and confusion on your kid's faces as you give them a laughingly small portion. And they can't throw it back at you, cause it's too light to do any real damage.

The other group that this drink is targeted at, or if it's not it should be, is drinkers. Not coke drinkers, alcohol drinkers. Think about it, you take a 200ml can of coke along with a 50ml bottle of scotch, put them together and presto, you have yourself a scotch and coke of the approximate right mixture. It would work out roughly the same size as one you would get at a pub or club, and at an approximate cost of $7.50, it's the same expense too. They should just tape them together in bottle shops, which is what they were doing earlier when they raised the tax on alco-pops. The new tax, apart from a fund raiser, was to slow the sale of alcohol as the government was worried people were drinking too much. Now the tax drove up the price at bottle shops, and saw a surge in the sales of full bottles of spirits. Well done Government, clearly that worked. And anyways, all the clever bottle shop attendants could be seen taping the small bottles of alcohol to cans and bottles of cola, and selling the combo packs at a price lower than that of the premixed cans and bottles. So the sales of alco-pops went down, cause it was too expensive, which only went to make the Government feel like they had done something for society. And it turns out they have effected society, but now people are merely making their own drinks, which I would guess that 9 times out of 10, are much stronger than the average alco-pop on sale, so in effect they have increased the amount we are drinking. Go Government!

So now, alcohol drinkers can determine the strength of their drink merely by selecting the size of the can to mix the drink with. Capitalism at its best."

Mum seems to be handling her Chemo pretty well. She's very tired all the time, and I'm not sure whether or not that's from the chemo or the cancer. She's off to the doctors today for an appointment, but she was in emergency last night as she's got a fever that comes and goes. The doctors say that she's got a virus, which should be manageable with drugs as long as it doesn't get any worse. Her temp ranges up to 38.2C, which the doctors told her was ""get to the emergency room"" range, but she's going to check with the doctors today at her appointment.

Work is doing fine. I have a suspicion that one of the guys who was hired at the same time as me will be getting fired soon, due to not turning up for work mutliple times in the last few weeks. This won't directly lead to more shifts for me, but one can only hope.

There seems to be a common thread with most of the people in my life at the moment, they're all experiencing some kind of pain. My girlfriend and a few of our friends bodies are falling apart, mum has cancer, Dad, my brother and I are all going through mum having cancer... it just seems like November isn't the month for me...

As I type, my house is being steam cleaned. There's nothing like being woken at 7am to move all the furniture in the house into the kitchen, and then to simply stand there and wonder... ""How am I going to eat breakfast?"". So I'm hiding in my room until the carpet is dry enough to walk on, which should be somewhere around midday. Don't worry though, I've got a box of muesli bars, and some cola in here (emergency supplies in case the ruski's atttack) so I should be able to tough it out till noon.

One of the guy's I work with, and am good friends with, recently read some of my writing. Now, he keeps telling me that I should finish my stories, one in particular. I'm not sure whether I lost the ability, or merely the want to write, but I just can't finish it. As it stands it's like 17 pages long, and it's good stuff cause I've edited it like fifteen times now, but I just can't seem to be able to write the next part. Though that seems to be the way with me. I get something creative in my teeth, then a month later i just don't have the drive to continue it anymore. Recently I've started a webcomic, with good characters and everything, and I just don't have the motivation to continue drawing it. It's the same with my writing, and a cross stitch I started recently, and various other projects throughout the twenty-five years I've been on this planet. It's true that my current apathy towards them could be driven by my current mental state due to my mother's current prediciment, but I'm just not sure...

My brother is coming over for dinner tonight, and with him he is bringing mum's christmas present; an iPod. Now, I'm not sure if I've posted in the past about my parent's lack of ability to do anything remotely technical related, but basically they are twelve o'clock flashers (by which I mean, if I wasn't here, every clock in the place would be flashing 12:00), and while that's fine if you respect it, My dad has a ""Keeping up with the Jones' "" mentality towards technology, so even though he has no idea how to use it, or more often than not, even what it does, he feels that ne needs it. So upon his recommendation mum is getting an iPod for her to listen to relaxation music while she tries to sleep in the middle of the day. 

Now, this is a fair enough sentiment, but why can't she just get a friggin cd player in the bedroom? They have a clock radio with a tape player in it, and I've offered to burn a CD for mum to listen to and then to transfer those cd's onto tape for her, but they said that it sounded like too much effort, and buying the iPod would be simpler. And I would agree, if I honestly thought that mum would actually use the friggin thing for an extended period of time, but I dare say that much like all the DVD's she's been bought over the years, her new iPod will just sit on her dresser, or away in a cupboard somewhere, while she lies down in silence. And while I'm on the topic, I'd like to mention that I'm now wondering about the sanity of the other members of my family, as when I suggested that we get a docking station for the iPod, both to keep it charged, but also to play the music through speakers, so that when mum lies down and wants to sleep, she doesn't have to do it with earphones in her ear, I got shouted down as they thought that it wasn't necessary. I've often thought that came at the world in a different way to the both of them, but the older I get the more sure of it I am.

I just escorted the Floor cleaner guy out of the house, and on his way out, he gave me a few samples of stuff that to be honest, I will never use, and I doubt that mum would either, but one of them is rather odd. The packet is holding an object that is roughly the size of a dishwsher tablet, and it says on the packaging that when you submerge the tablet thingy in water, it expands into a full size cloth. Now I know that miniturisation is the latest fad, just look at mobile phones, or coke cans (more later), but why did someone look at a cloth and say, you know what, I reckon we can make that into a tablet. Food should be in tablet form by now. Atleast that's what the Jetsons raised me to expect, but cloths? Or maybe I'm being too judgemental, maybe this is the first step towards the miniturisation of all things good. So look out steak in a pill, and the dehydrated pizza from ""Back to the Future II"", you'd better be here soon, otherwise I'm gonna crack it.

</ljcut>
Apoligies to any of you who have just actually read this dribble... but aparently I needed to vent a little. I could continue, but the fumes from my carpet and the lingering smell of the freshly painted house are starting to annoy me I think... I might head out ans experience some of this ""sunshine"".. whatever that is..."

"event","On friday of this week, we discovered that my mother has incurable pancreatic cancer, which has partially spread to her liver.

Due to the location and type of cancer, radiation therapy isn't an option; and due to the blood thinners, surgery also has been ruled out, and will never be an option, due to the fact that the cancer is what's making her blood thicken and clot.

So the course of treatment is chemotherapy, once a week, for the rest of her life. And due to the fact that the cancer is thickening her blood, she will be on blood thinners for the rest of her life, which requires her to inject herself in the abdomen twice daily.

The doctors as yet have not given us a solid estimation of her time left, as there are still a few more tests they will be preforming. She has an appointment with the doctors at the start of October, at which they will lay all the cards on the table. 

Mum is home from hospital now, and attempting to rest to the best of her abilities. 

The family have known for a fortnight now that she had cancer, but we were not expecting, nor were we prepared for the result to be this terrible. 

I know that the thoughts and the prayers of you all are with not only myself, or my mother, but with my entire family at this time. 

May you be saved from the perils that life has thrown at my family.

God bless, and God speed."

"event","Not knowing where to begin, I shall just pick a point, and go from there.

Mum's no good. Last thursday she had to go back into hospital. Her leg blew up to roughly twice the size, ir turned red, and was sore to touch and walk on. She went to her doctor, and he sent her straight to hospital. The crux of the story is that the warfrin (sp?) that she was on for her blood clots doesn't work. The doctors as yet don't know why it's not working, but she's going to stay in hospital until they've found out why. 

So, The result of this is a new clot in her left leg, and the clot in her right leg, which was roughly 6 inches long, now extends from just about her hip, to her toes. 

Ewan is displeased. Especially as we were in the emergency room 2 weeks ago, and told the doctors there that a new clot had developed, and we had the ultrasound images to show this, and the doctors said that it was likely that they just missed the clot in the other leg when she was in hospital the first time. To which we said ""But she's on an anti-coagulant. She shouldn't have new clots!"" but they assumed that they simply missed the clot the first time. So now we're proved right.

On top of this...

My eldest brother Peter woke up on night roughly a week ago with no feeling in the left side of his face. He got up and looked in a mirror and found that it had dropped, just like as if he had a stroke. So an ambulance trip and a few tests later, he found out that he didn't have a stroke, but he has got Bell's Palsy (again sp?). To which the doctors said that there's really nothing they can do. Either it will get better on it's own, or it won't.

On top of this...

As some of you man already know, my dad was previously married before marrying my mother. I've been alive for 25 years now, and only a few days ago I found out why and how his first marrige ended. I've always known that it wasn't a good seperation, because my dad got custody of the three boys. So I knew that there was always a reason.

The other day, my brother mark, who has never really liked my mother, visited her in hospital. Which nearly gave my mother a heart attack. Dad was talking to me later that evening, talking about how Mark had said things and done things in the past which would never be forgiven, or forgotten. I wasn't sure what dad was referring to so I asked him. He told me stories about what mark had said about my mum, which I won't repete here, and how when mark got married, Dad and mum were put on a table at the back of the room, which dad's ex-wife (mark's biological mother) was a part of the bridal table. 

Again, I'm babbling a little here, but basically, dad told me how his first wife had been cheating on him for more than 6 months with the man she's currently married to, before walking out on my father, and the three boys. This is why dad got full custody. Some time later, she got visiting rights, my dad being the nice guy he is allowed her to have the boys on the weekends on occasion. When the boys grew up, she attempted to tell the boys the story that Dad had been cheating on HER with my mother, which was the reason for the divorce.

One of the sons (I believe) has swallowed this lie hook line and sinker. One didn't believe, and one refused to have anything to do with her after she tried so spread these lies.

I'm sure you can imagine the one I'm closest too, the one I speak to on occasion, and the one I speak to only on family occasions...

On top of this...

My girlfriends Dad is now out of hospital, after a few complications with his surgery.
He's still got to take something like 17 pills a day for a while, but it's great to see him walking about.

And so, now that I've vented a little, about a few of my problems, I believe it's time for sleep...

Goodnight all..."

Status: Possibly missing, only rare contact has been established.

Grading: possible candidate.

So, It's true that I've been gone for a while (19 weeks according to LJ) so here is an update of what people may have missed.

Home - Well, tragically I'm still living with mum and dad, which has it's good sides and it's bad sides. Though the timer has officially been set as mum and dad are looking to move to the bush in a year, so I'm on the house hunt once more. Looking around Richmond and it's surrounds.
But even if I find a place tomorrow, it'll be a while before I actually get around to moving out, just because of mum. Recently mum had some leg pain, which turned out to be DVT, or in lamens terms, a large group of blood clots in her legs, and one in her lung. So two hospital trips and a lot of blood tests later, she's coming along ok. But I'd still rather be here for a little while longer.

Job - I'm now working as an internet help desk technician for a satellite internet company which very few people have ever heard of. The pay is steady, the hours reasonable, and the co-workers satisfactorially geeky. So I'm all good.

Friends - It's strange but we're all growing up. Turtle's recently had a vocational overhaul, and wound up being the assistant store manager at a shop 5 minutes from his home. The Greek spends roughly equal time working and working out. And Wally, well, wally's doing okay for himself, despite a recent motorbike accident, he's moved out of his mother's place and is living with his brother.

Love - A, sweet amore. Love is good, grand, and every facet inbetween. I am just shy of my 2 year anniversary to a wonderful woman. Someone I would be lost without.

Recent / Upcoming events - A trip to warm the blood, and expand the horizons. End of September I'm taking my better half to the (hopefully) sunny shores of our sister city to the north, Sydney. Spending a week away from it all should recharge, re-coup, and revitalise.

On a slightly sadder note, GF's father will go into surgery tomorrow, to remove a cancerous kidney. My thoughts and prayers go out to him, his family, and all those closeby."

Let me take you back to a time you may not remember, or for some of you, you may not WANT to remember... but tough, we're going there anyways.

Back to a time where one person slaved at a job that he really didn't like...

That young man, slaving away delivering mail, sweating in the hot melbournian sun. 

Now, this young man (young being used as a figurative term, he isn't really that young, but he is younger than some) one day, told his boss to shove it. And QUIT.

Yeah... didn't see that one coming did ya?

So, I'm now working at Village Cinemas as a Biotechnician. Or for the laypersons... a projectionist.

So yay! NEW JOB!

In other news, Andie and I are still going strong, which is great.
She's recently hurt her knee, which is nto so good. But we also got away during easter, which is great. But after that she had to go back to school... you see where this is going... :D

So, Work life = GREAT
LOVE life = GREAT

Home life = can be improved, given that I am back at home... for now... (Glares round the room.... not at anybody... just around in general...)

So yes... tis late and I should be off to bed... take care everybody... I'll be back shortly...

It was this time last year that I headed north up to Sydney to catch up with a mate of mine, and I dragged along my mate and we had a pearler of a time. And I remember that it was exactly this time of year, because I was in Sydne for last year's grand final.

This year, instead of north, I'm heading east, to New Zealand. And instead of dragging a friend along, I'm being accompanied by my loverly girlfriend. And, we will be away for the grand final.

This will probably be my last post before I go away, and odds are I won't post while I'm away, I'l just do one of those long winded posts I do when I get back.

I have my 1 year anniversary with the girlfriend recently. I know that girls say that it's the little things that they want. A steady dependable guy, someone who listens to them, someone who they can trust. Well, here's a free nugget of advice for the guys out there. They also like to be romanced. :D

In roughly 15 days from right now, I will be landing in New Zealand. My first trip out of Australia. I'm kinda nervous, but mainly just excited about the trip. I get to spend a week with my girl, overseas, can anyone out there honestly think of a better way to spend a week?

Now for those who have not seen a a full powered Ewan arguing about somethign be believes to be true, then unfortunatly you will have to go elsewhere for a discription, as i cannot honestly do the description justice.

However, I feel that my days with latrobe may be coming to an end. And even though my boss and I are on amicable terms, even polite and reasonable, considering some of the things i said and accused him of, I feel that my work is being scrutainised, and that I will soon be needing a new job.

Also, of late, I've been looking for a new place to stay. George my current landlord is going to be getting married and his fiancee and her son will be moving in, which is my cue to move out. So, for a period of time, I'm goign to be moving back in with mum and dad till i can find a place i can call my own. I've been looking around but as yet haven't been able to find a place.

Needless to say this is going to throw my life out of whack for a little while.

The funeral is going to be sometime at the end of next week in Bendigo, and I'm going to have to give a part of the eulogy, which means I have to practice my bible talk.

Nan, even though I said my goodbyes to you long ago, i will still miss you. I will remember the times you sat me in your kitchen, and tried to convince me that porridge tasted good. And the way you use to make special pasties for each person who came up to see you, and how mine was almost devoid of any vegetables whatsoever. I will miss you nanna mat. May you rest in peace.

As a tribute i am going to re-post a piece i put into my luna_poet account here. I know I'm no shakespeare, but sometimes old words can say that which we now cannot.

<i><b>Vera</b>

She sits there breathing softly,
her hands so warm,
her face so cold.

The unrelenting beep of the machine
keeps me awake as I slide into sleep.
Propped up in a chair,
my back clicks out of place.

I stare at this woman,
not recognising the face.
She is not the woman I know,
so empty of life, and love.

The nurses come and go,
Checking clipboards, smiling awkwardly.
Their attempts to console fall on deaf ears.
I realise the obvious; she may never wake.

She lies there unmoving,
the doctors pass unmoved.
If she should pass, I will be there.
Holding her hand,
clinging to the warmth,
letting tears fall.
She'll rest forever more. 
</i>

Rest in peace, Nan."

20. What is the love of my life doing at this very moment?
What is he thinking? (The Streets) - hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe *cough*

21. How will I die?
Throw your arms around me (Tripod) - which means i won't be alone... nice to know...

In other news... I have been unbelievably happy over the past few weeks, to the point where I've written 2 songs... no points for guessing the muse for such songs... and writing songs is something that I've missed in the past... oh... i dunno... YEAR!

Anyways... my breakfast is ready... I got woken at 6am this morning by a housemate who thought they had thrown out their wallet with their KFC rubbish last night... and today being bin day... :D so I'm a big ball of energy... and will be for alteast a few more minutes... :)

New years eve with Andie... :D Sorry... just had to have it in writing somewhere... :D

I have a new girlfriend!

I have been doing my best to explain to her that she's smarter than I am... and better looking, but I've been having some trouble... so anyone who can help me in this battle... feel free.

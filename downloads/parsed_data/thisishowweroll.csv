"event","I just watched Elizabetown with a bunch of girls. And you know I did get a lot out of the last 30 minutes of the movie. I'm not trying to be funny or anything when I say that eithier. I mean it. It was absoloutely beautiful in my opinion. I just don't think theres anything better than when you can see life being portrayed in such a heart felt way. I think everyone can relate to those moments when you smile because the sun is in your eyes when you get to the top of that hill, you cry because that song that came on your mix cd was perfect for that moment you were in, your happy because you've got your best friend beside you to share that laugh felt deep in the walls of your stomach. Just life itself is wonderful. Letting the wind swooooooosh you away to a new day of just love and happiness and peace of just being.

I just love life...as you can tell.

I really enjoyed at least the last part of the movie. The beginning of it was like it was trying to have the same story as Garden State or something. Just the whole parent dies, goes back to hometown, meets a girl who helps him find who he is and get in touch with his emotions. It bugged me, but I tried to just enjoy the movie...and eventually I really really did.

I'm so happy, as usual. The only thing bringing me down are these pounding headaches. I really don't know what's wrong with me. My grades are so good right now, I'm really proud of myself because I've put a lot of time into school lately to make up for last semester. And I aced my history test! Well I better go. I'm so glad Gillian made me the soundtrack to Elizabethtown because I knew I would want it when I was done watching the movie. It's really good driving music. I think thats going to be my next project. A CD with such a wide assortment of music...even...even....bluegrass!! Yeah so wide it'll cover bluegrass!! Hahahah I don't know. Just a CD with nothing but beautifully different songs that will be sure to cover all of those perfect moments that are just made better with the music of a song."

"event","<P>So things have been going. I have chronic headache disease or something going on. I'm not kidding my head never stops pounding! I miss my grandparents a ton and I've been having really freaky dreams lately. I volunteered to help this girl who moved here from Honduras because her mom died and her only living relative is her uncle who lives here. So she basically knows nothing but spanish and the bilingual teacher at her school doesn't help much. So I'm going to tutor her, shes in fourth grade and I'm really excited to be able to do this.&nbsp; Amy came over afterschool yesterday and we made Madeline a big cookie because she had her nose rebroken. We seriously had so much fun. Amy makes me laugh so hard. We found these bags on the side of the road that said free so we grabbed them and got a bunch of free candles! It was so cool! Anyways nothing else is really going on. Livejournal was acting really weird for me lately but now its all good. I have pictures, just like I said I would! oh and fall out boy is so catchy it makes me sick, because I'm walking around singing dance,dance. ugh, fall out boy reminds me of the entire student body of saugus high. </P>

<P>Yesterday's weather was absoloutely beautiful. I really did hug the air, more than once too. The weeks are flying by and it'll be summer before I know it. These sunsets remind me of summer. I have such a love for the sun its unbelievable. This weekends going to be good, because I think I'll just have to make it good. I'm doing Amy's make up for formal tomorrow. I'm not really that sad that I can't go, because I get to watch all my friends go off looking there best! I'm going to hang out with Kirin a lot too. I really love her already. I'm just so determined to get her settled here. I mean I know time will work everything out, but I'm going to try to help time move faster for her. Oh and I'm going to have a lot more picture posts because I like looking back on my entries and seeing pictures with all the stuff I wrote. Hope you guys don't mind!</P>

"event","<P>This weekend has been pretty eventful but uneventful at the same time. I saw my dad on saturday only for him to tell me that he wasn't going to see me again. It was really hard on me, I cried the whole way back to my house after breakfast, so I don't know about that whole situation. The rest of the weekend was just crazy stuff. Today was the best though. Brenna and I went to Robert's and made cookies for Sister Shardlow and Kirin (and the Elowitts of course)It just really felt so good to put smiles on peoples faces. I've been trying really hard to make Kirin feel at home and to get comfortable around here and I think shes feeling a lot better about moving here. I mean I can tell she really is comfortable with me and it makes me so happy because thats what I really really want. Plus I know how moving somewhere with totally unfamiliar faces can be! Plus the sunset was beautiful! Just perfect! I made Brenna pull over so I could get out of the car and pretend to fly because of all the wind. I love life. Honestly, the littlest and most beautiful things in this world make me so happy I could just cry. Anyways I better go but here are some pictures of the weekend!</P>

<P>i seriously cannot get over how funny these are. I just look at them and laugh. I don't know if its Andrews psycho grin in the pictures or just my weird faces, or maybe its just because it was so funny when we took them.

so I'm home sweet home. There really isn't much to say about my trip- well I guess there is, it just doesn't seem worth saying. The only highlights were the many Broadway shows I saw and some of the cool stuff I picked up. Other than that, it was just way too much time spent away from home,family, and friends. I have lots of unpacking and laundry to do which I'm not looking forward to.

Yesterday was tons of fun though, so thanks to everyone I saw! I just really had a good time. Especially watching Arrested Development, that was pretty darn funny. And Andrew when you come home next we have to hang out a lot more than we did this time, because I had a lot of fun with you and I realized how much I really miss having your butt around! 

Soooooooo I'm free all week. So just call my cell."

<P>Hahahaha. I don't think I've ever been so annoyed with Brenna before in my life.</P>
So I'm in the process of putting music back into my computer, it's really boring, but it needs to be done I guess. I guess there are some major Halloween festivities this weekend. Some sort of scary movie Brenna's talking about? And pumpkin carving. And let me tell you, i live for pumpkin carving, so I'm really excited. Oh and I cleaned out my binder today, and wow does it feel good."

"event","So I'm pretty much ready to get this over with, because I've been crying and stressing and waking up all shakey and it really isn't fun to deal with myself right now. Plus most of my free time has been spent sleeping so that I don't think so much and so I don't start panicking all over again. I should be done by probably 2 tomorrow, so if I don't call you and let you know what happened and you want to call me to see whats going on- feel free to, I'll probably appreciate your call all the same. I love you all so incredibly much, your the greatest friends ever. And regardless of what happens, nevermind, I don't even want to go there.
oh and to top it off, our computer just got fixed because we had a virus, but it erased ALL of my pictures, videos, and music. My pictures are totally irreplaceable, and my music will take me forever to put back into my computer, and some of those unreleased bright eyes songs are from random sights that I don't have anymore, as well as a lot of other music. So basically I'm really sad about that. My music library was just starting to finally gain some size, and now I have to reload everything and research everything. But I guess next to everything else I have to deal with, this is nothing. So what am I complaining about. Hah, where is my head at? Okay goodnight you guys, love you a lot.<3"

"event","i'm kind of bummed because I didn't bring my camera to school today and there was the prettiest rainbow this morning! It was honestly like the most perfect rainbow ever, so even though I couldn't take a picture of it, it made me happy and thats good for me I guess.

Lunch was fun because brenna needed kevin, ximmer and i for her video class assignment which was making a music video. So we made it without music because i guess she'll add the music later, but basically the song is ""what is love"" yeah yeah the one that goes what is love? baby don't hurt me..blah blah blah worst song ever i know. So in previous times kevin and i were together, but now ximmer and i are. So ximmer and i skip and hold hands and kevin hides in bushes making overly dramatic sad faces spying on us, and then finally at the end kevin just can't take the jealousy so he grabs ximmer, hits him, ximmer falls to the floor and kevin wins me back. good story huh? Haha, not really but it was so fun to make. Mainly because of Kevin and his faces, and then when ximmer and i would walk together I would twirl my pigtails and he would make these faces at me and it was just really really funny. i ended up with a headache my last 2 periods because I laughed so hard. 

I just got home, booga and his mother dropped me off and it started thundering and pouring so i ran outside and danced with haden. Oh that is after I found him in duran's truck trying to start it!  I got called pochonatas A LOT today. But the weird thing is that I can't remember pochontas having pigtail braids, maybe its because I keep thinking about the part where she sings colors of the wind and her hair flows all over the place, i don't know. Maybe it's been a while since I've seen it.
Oh and I've been listening to Elliott Smith's self titled album, and oh my gosh, it's so good. I wonder whats taken me so long to listen to it!

so i may have not had my camera earlier to get the pretty rainbow, but i certainly did a few minutes ago when i stepped out into my backyard to once again dance in the rain.

<P>So torwards the end of my night I decided to call Booga, and Brenna and I went over there. I seriously haven't been there in so long. So I came in and saw Bagel who was barking like crazy, and then i walked around and just kind of appreciated being in his house. Don't ask me why, i just really did. There house has a really familiar smell to it, and i like it a lot. And then I saw that my note was still on the refrigerator and it made me really happy. So I walked into the garage to discover that it has a huge tree in it, but its cool I guess, it has a nice homey feel to it, ahha. We just talked and Sam was with us and hes so funny, i love the way he talks. I'm glad I didn't go to the movie because I kind of didn't want to be scared and I kind of just liked driving around. Oh and this car full of guys pulled up next to brenna, serena and i and they were looking at us smiling, and brenna's just like "" just look forward, look forward"" but idecided to turn and look at them straight in the eye and I started picking my nose, hahahah. It was so funny, because they weren't even disgusted, they were just laughing. I'm so weird. <lj-cut text=""+2""> </P>

I don't know it made me happy and it was fun, i seriously love kids. Then I got to come home and see Kevin and then Seth came over and then Adam and we watched Family Guy, and okay..the show is pretty darn funny, haha.
 Today I'm just knocking out all my reports and projects and I did a pretty superb job of cleaning my room and washing my blanket finally. I'm actually happy to be home right now, all the windows are open and it just smells so good in my house and today is so pretty. Nothing better than partly cloudy.

So I hung up with him and went downstairs to find a huge package, from who else but my uncle. He got me a guitar. A Fender Acoustic Guitar to be more detailed. So I sat there on the floor looking at it, and i just thought, ""wow, my dad goes to jail and i get a guitar"" and i seriously just wanted to throw it out the window."

<P>I might possibly have on of the most amazing girl as my best friend. I love Lauren. I love how we always have fun together no matter what. And even though you go to Hart, your still always in my mind and heart and we all love and miss you. Always. </P>
<P>So this week was a very tiring and emotional one. I went to the DIA meeting with Booga and Kevin on&nbsp;Friday, because I really think I need to get involved with&nbsp;things I like. So I went just to see what it was all about, and we kind of came in late, so i think i missed a lot of info, but it still looks pretty good.&nbsp;Friday Lauren &amp; I got our nails done, got starbucks and then mingled with the big Quizno's cup. Haha. We went to Savons and got water bottles and gum and I found a really cute 3 dollar sweater..but, it was a little small, so I didn't get it. Saw everyone when they came back from Amoeba and Adam and Ximmer woke me up at&nbsp; like 11:30 so that they could bring me a bottle of orange juice from walmart and then I guess they went to the Wiggin's to have some huge boy sleepover. Lauren slept over and then on Saturday Brenna and I had to go to this company picnic and besides the cotton candy, ferris wheel, and face painting..it was lame. We finally got hom3 at like 4, so I showered and went to Lauren's and we just hung out all night together, and we had a really good time. And make fun of me all you want, but I really like Mandy Moore's song 'Crush'. I mean come on, I don't think there's one girl who doesn't like that song!&nbsp; Anyways, I hope you all have a good week! Oh and I found new Bright Eyes songs again, so Andrew, I really have no clue when you'll read this or when you'll have a computer, but when you do, I'll email you the link.</P>

"event","umm i think i'm the only person on this planet who has read harry potter but hasn't gotten the new book yet. i guess i need to get it. i saw herbie with adam today. we decided that lindsay lohan definitly got her boobs done because they are way too huge for her body. being around adam sometimes really just stresses me out, he has like nervous energy or something. took him home and ate mashed potatoes and now i'm updating and i don't really know why, i'm kind of bored I guess. i think i'm going to go to laurens. bye.<3"

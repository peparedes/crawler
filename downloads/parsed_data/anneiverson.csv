"event","last week an aussie family moved in w/ me and now my life rules.   two girls, seven and eight, and their mom.  now it's cuddles and cooking and legos all the time! yes!

feeling really integrated into the peter/katie/mike/curtis/tina....circle which is amazing.  we are slowly coming out to people that are good folks to us.

no longer a collective member at the market.  feeling good about that decision, still feel stressed and guilty sometimes but working on that.  miss some of the folks i used to be closer with, for what it's worth, before the market started.

ooooohhh yeah gonna be a midwife!

"event","winter.  sore muscles.

sometimes life is reduced to lattes and loan payments, inextricably linked.  need a new job.

good things: 

learning about my own fertility.  tracking temperature and ovulation and cervical fluid.  pretty amazing thing, the female body.

knitting the best scarf of my life.  for one of the best people in my life, and she doesn't even know it!

actually communicating with my estranged sister.  i'm the maid of honor in her wedding (what! i know. whodathought. at least the dress is hot.)

made some big steps with the other lady in my tri-lationship.  this might be the most fulfilling thing going on with me right now. 

writing lots of letters, and actually sending them.

bad things:

sam again chose boy over best friend. for the last time, with me at least.  i imagine she's found a way to rationalize it all so it's my fault.  really, though, i might have said the words to end the friendship but she performed the actions.  i'm profoundly sad about it still, but am finding ways to accept it.  it's just hard to understand how some folks can just...drop...you one day and act like you haven't spent six years knowing everything about each other.  why is it so hard to have emotional intimacy with more than one person at a time?  will anyone ever be able to help me understand her?  feels like a slap in the face, a punch in the gut.  and getting blamed for it, no less.  i just can't go through this shit again.  i'd rather she be happy at least for the time being without me than act like i'm okay with the way she treats me.  been there.

really need to be on this midwife thing, trying as hard as i can to stick it out with the peoples market till the end of the month like i said i would.  i will.

"event","this week has been lots of the people's market.  two collective members are gone for awhile and i am getting the opportunity to be responsible and informed which is really, nice.  somehow it is not so overwhelming because i've gotten the space to get my own handle on it.  and it's great.  and things are organized and hopefully a little more accessible.

had a freak out earlier this week when a couple friends got arrested and i realized i have distanced myself so much from one of them that there is no way i would know what was happening to them.  and i was worried, a little panicked, and more than a little surprised by my reaction.  feel like i almost don't have the right to ask to be informed, but also i care.  and that is genuine, if at a distance.  always has been.  they are ok and safe.  

watched obama's speech.  hard to get over my skepticism and disillusionment, and sometimes hard to distinguish those things from the radicalization i've developed since that last general election.  didn't hear much of anything controversial.  a little freaked out by the fanaticism i saw, but i think i get it."

i'm the third one in the relationship, if you look at it that way.  we've been trying to have time all together every so often, but mostly it is just the two of them or the two of us.  and now i am experimenting with my own capacity to date more than one person because i've become involved with someone else.  that is a whole different experience, and i'm not sure how i am about it, how i feel about it.  it seems like i've been open and honest and embracing and it has--at least for now--created this amazing balance of serendipidous time and i think all of us are amazed at how well it is going.  part of me is waiting for the crash, at least on the end of the second person i am dating.  dating?  i guess we haven't used that word, yet.  in the serious relationship i think it is so different from my previous experiences with this (among a million other reasons) because we are checking in for real and focusing on us all not any one of us more than the other.  and i am communicating directly with both of them.  so good!  i am in love with the universe, and so grateful.  where has all my jealousy gone?"

another co-worker got fired.  that place is fucked and has been since andy went to japan.  half the staff is brand new and i need out before i get canned, too.  plus, only one man remains and that isn't a sure thing either.  i don't know how long i'll last after he's gone, whenever that happens.

my grandma had brain surgery last week.  the surgery went well, but the recovery is not going well at all.  i cried with my dad on the phone a couple days ago.  that is the third time i've witnessed his tears in sixteen years.  he gave the monotone run-down of what is happening with grandma bernice, and after a pause i asked him how HE was doing and he just started sobbing.  my heart broke.  just yesterday they got the news that the tumor they removed was partly malignant, unlike the last two.  how many brain surgeries?  i might jet off to iowa unexpectedly soon.

1. i'm moving on thursday and i am super excited about it.  nervous about how people will deal with sharing space with spacey cats who like to yell a lot.
2. getting to a place where i will actually, you know, take some action about my future.  after the move and the settling.  i want to hibernate with the GRE book, meet up with professors, get shit together, enroll in something.  something.   
3. single.  i forgot who i was for awhile.  i forgot that i am not the reactions to my relationships and the more relationships i have (and the deeper they are), the more i discover about myself and i am interested in being interesting to myself.  i would not say my life is balanced, but i would say that i am a more self-confident person now than i have been in a long time.  i can make my own decisions, i know again that i can take care of myself.  and more importantly, i know that that is not just a statement of defiance but of truth.  i might look back on this period of time as a time of revelry, mistakes, youthful indiscretions, intentional lack of equilibrium.  but it is so what i need right now.  holidays are coming, though, and that scares me.  holidays are not so good in my life.
4. my sexuality is some confusing shit, i am telling you.

"event","so i keep thinking it can't get worse, but of course it can.  why not?

the last remaining roommate is moving out.  so i must find a new place to live.  i will miss this house but i am trying to think of the good opportunities i can make out of it.  get rid of some stuff.  start anew.  take advantage of not paying rent to maybe travel a little if audrey's parents will love on the cats for a little while.  poor guys don't know what changes are ahead...

finding a new place should be easier than finding a new job, so in that sense i am lucky.  i am just hoping to find someone who is willing to move in with me somewhere, because i can't handle a single apartment's rent.  i really really want to go to iowa because i miss my family and i just need someone to take care of me a little bit.  i know my mom is going to harp on me about living there, but i could never stay.  if lawrence is a complacency-producing vortex, le mars is a depression-inducing hellpit.  hence my need to escape it in the first place.  but it will be nice to see my family.  

the more these things happen, the more free i am as a person.  if the things i fear the most are realized, i will be able to conquer them (and have before, many times).  this is without a doubt my lesson for 2007.

"event","I rocked out so hard at the Arcade Fire concert that I am still feeling it.

It was an open air theater.  I ditched all the folks I was with in the middle and went to the front area but there were guards keeping the front reserved.  Some random women and I plotted to break the barricade to get to the front and we jumped the seats in front of us and weaseled ALL THE WAY TO THE FRONT ROW.  I went crazy.  They played ""Crown of Love"" and ""Wake Up"" for the encore, which are the two most hardcore songs, I think.  I think there might have been only a handful of other people enjoying that concert as much as I was, and we were eventually all up there having the best time.

Then I came home and immediately made a huge stir-fry meal.  It was awesome.

Reading and absorbing her makes me retroactively legitimize so much of what I had tried to say but could not articulate/justify/rationalize about my feelings and why they matter.  

It makes me want to connect with more women in more ways and take it all seriously and joyfully.  I am trying to stay in a place where I believe deep feeling is free and beautiful.  That it doesn't mean control or expectations.  I realize that I'm not down for tug-of-war relationships but I am down for real friendships and connections.  And that is not threatening to me or anyone else.  I want to put myself out there and be unaffected by rejection (though I'm not sure how possible that is for me right now).  I want to be silly and irresponsible.  And plant things and watch them grow.  There has been a lot of that in my life.

I am wishing I could put feelings down as poetry, but in the meantime I am surrounding myself with others' poetry in different ways.

almost bought a house this week with marshall and nick.  we had credit checks, loan papers, were working up a contract with the seller.  but i think we are backing out of this particular house because of how financially bad the heating situation is in the house.  we have money and labor to invest in a home, but this one needs more loving than most.  which is kind of why i wanted to buy it.  cosmetic stuff is no problem...figuring out things like heating in a 150 year old brick house  is another story.  there are so many more things that are righteous about buying a house.  so many.

i still want to buy one, with these people if possible.  but i don't know yet how they are feeling about it.  it's a good time to invest.  lawrence is a great place with a lot of happening things.

i've been getting worked up about the biphobia here, however.  it seems to come at me from all sides and i am getting mad enough to want to do something about it.  so i guess there was a group awhile ago called queer as fuck and if that starts up again (there's been talk) i want bisexuality to be a big deal in it.  thinking about helping restart that and building up discourse about bi life wherever i am.  i'm pretty fed up with dealing with homophobia from one side and heterophobia on the other (livejournal thinks that isn't a word...interesting).  i'm not a traitor to either side, and i think it's pretty shitty that for all the sexual liberation talk in the gay/lesbian community there seem to be even more boxes to fit our desires into than i could possibly have imagined.  how many (queer-straight-bi-political) points to you have to have to be considered legitimately (insert self-identified sexual orientation here)?  fucking none, that's what.  this town is not liberated.  i am not pretending to be het or lesbian to try to get into any communities.  unfortunately that seems to mean i have a hard time getting into them at all.  fuck that.

and bisexuality and monogamy?  i am in for a lifetime of complication.

i started attending a new feminist book group.  starting with alice walker, yes!  i'm excited.  i'm also excited about practicing artistic skills and sharing them with others and gleaning what they have.

otras noticias...veemos...i have a heinous sunburn from working in the garden, which is going soooo well.  the sunny day yesterday was just what we needed to get things done and today it is raining again :)  thanks, mama earth!  

withdrew my teach for america application this morning and am still spinning from it.  i don't know how i'm gonna tell the people who wrote me letters.  i guess i will just sit down with them and explain why i made the decision and be honest about it.  i ain't made to do that just yet.  i want even a little teaching experience first, and i want it to feel like it fits instead of clutching at something to do with my life.  i was doing a pretty good job at convincing myself that i was meant to do it, but serendipity took over and decided that i was not.  which is how my life generally works.   what i really want to do is go to grad school, and that feels like a great fit.  in what, i don't know.  anybody know anything about masters in public health?  not sociology.  more women's studies sounds interesting but not career-responsible blah blah blah.  i'd like to continue studying that but as an aspect of my life and my profession, not as something i need to bank on for cash.  

in the mean time  I NEED ROOMMATES VERY VERY MUCH.  MY HOUSE IS AMAZING and you or someone you know should move into it with me.  it's a four bedroom (3 available) on New York St. in East Lawrence.   at 12th and NY.  great backyard, huge porch, amazing landlord, and you can even comfortably hang out on the roof.  plus we have a hammock and a firepit and two adorable low-dander kitties.  <u>time is of the essence!</u>  this house is hot shit and i am going to lose it very soon if i don't get some roommates and then what!  i don't know!  and if you don't want to move in for some crazy reason, you should adopt me and my kitties because soon i will be homeless.

i've been feeling artsy lately.  i painted and oil abstract.  it's little, but it's genuine."

"event","well i'm back in d.c., this time for the national conference on organized resistance.  we took an absolutely full bus and 30 odd hours later, here we are.  taking a nice break in ethan/jack's house north of town in maryland.  tonight the actual event starts, but the adventure started long ago.  i'm glad to have a break from lawrence, from work, and from the hum-drum of being out of school and still in lawrence.

i'm applying for teach for america.  right now.  i'm having sort of an existential moment in which  i am wondering how i am supposed to state my personal philosophy, background, life process, etc. in 500 words.  


and procrastinating.  i have little internet access since my roommates are always on their computers and mine is broken.  mostly have been relying on phones/in person conversations.  

so...what am i about?  how do i begin this mindmap of condensed me?  yeeeeeeeeesh."

"event","i'm having a mild surge in my social life, which is uplifting.  i'm starting to actually think about what to do with my future.  talking to travis has got me all thinking about community energy and where i want to grow next.  if the soil isn't right, how can you thrive?

i decided not to go to el salvador this spring, which is a major downer because i was really looking forward to it, but i also need to think about things like health care and financial responsibility.  no health insurance is a MAJOR downer.  'specially since it's yearly checkup time.

i've been having all kinds of crazy prophetic dreams lately, most of which i am keeping quiet and contemplating while i still remember them.  my aura is going through some kind of transition, hopefully into a more balanced state. 

i'm changing my weekly schedule, so i will be working slightly fewer hours and at only one job.  i'm not really into this twelve hour day two-to-three times a week thing.  i finally have a day off tomorrow, fantastic!  i plan on drinking and playing cards.  and playing with my cats.  we have been real cuddly in the mornings, and it is fun to play with them through the shower curtain.  i see a bubble bath in my future!  

i'm spending some grad money on a tattoo now that i have accepted the impermanence of my corporeal being and the fact that tattoos are NOT forever, they are just as much for now as everything else.  a tattoo of what?  the moon, of course!  i am in love with it for all eternity, after all.  it does play a huge part in running my life (and life creating abilities).  only appropriate to pay homage."

So if you do not want to post it in response to this, you can email it to me at seedling [at] riseup [dot] net.  Don't think you are the one person whose number I don't really care to have, because I can tell you right now that you are wrong. 

And, if you send it to me, you won't have to deal with my problems of losing your number because I putting them straight into my new agenda.  
Doesn't that sound great!  Yeah, I think so, too!

Also, if you have given me your number in the past, don't assume I have it as of right now.  I don't even have my roommates' numbers, for chrissakes."

"event","""And no,"" she said, ""I am not afraid of loving you.  At last I see you for what you are.  I see the child in you that became the man and is now fast becoming the person.  Your sins are no graver than my own.  I indulged in my fantasies of violence for years before I tried to change; as you indulged in sterile, exploitive relationships with other women.  I couldn't see why <i>I</i> should be the one asked not to seek revenge, why the buck of violence must stop wiht me.  Besides, must I myself be the only model I had for the creature I intended to be?  There is a card in tarot, the ninth card, and its message is: What you hope for, you also fear.  This is how it was with me.""

"event","So the more I host the crafty potluck and the more I ""plan"" this wine and cheese thing I will be having for my graduation (which is also functionally a potluck...of wine and cheese), the more I think that really it's worth it to ask someone to host your parties for you.  

You know, I am going to be stressed out all over the place trying to talk to everyone and making sure people have what they need, when I know that all I really want to do is enjoy the gathering just as much as anyone else.  When my family was here for thanksgiving, I was so grateful that my mom was all on top of helping out with the prep and cleaning.  Hopefully someone feels like helping me out with this graduation wine and cheese thing, because graduating is already turning out to be one of those underwhelming events that has overwhelming effects.  

Just sayin', it would be nice to have a hosting buddy.  Someone to help me take it all on."

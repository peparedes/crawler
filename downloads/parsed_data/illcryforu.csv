"event","For some reason of all that ive written...today i came with this, opinions?

In only one moment the stars are exposed 
A rare beauty to be seen 
For in this metropolis our fake candles overshadow our mothers elegant and graceful movements 
To be this lucky to see such a sight on a terrace with you 
For one moment in a night 
I admit a tear fell 
 
A goddess to our skies 
A princess in my presence 
I wonder how this fortune has been bestowed upon my meager eyes 
But never think twice about accepting such a gift 
Then there was another tear 
 
As this tear fell, I felt it's warmth 
It's love 
I kissed it 
Felt the passion of my own heart on my own lips 
Afterall, it came from loving eyes 
Mine 
 
The clouds rolled over our mothers naked beauty 
Covering her for the rest of the night 
Maybe keeping her warm 
Afterall, she bears her breasts with the angelic hymns of the heavens melodies 
 
Only to be seen by the pure hearted 
To hearted heat 
To make me realize 
The beauty you possess I will never forget 
I will never forget... 
That one moment"

"event","at times i wish i could just go back to the old days, when i used to be in bording school in New Zealand. Things were just mint over there, from camping out in the mountains to sleeping in the grass gazing at the nights sky to waking up bathing in a fresh water river to the after noons of waterfall cliff diving..so beautiful. i remember just running through the wet grassy rugby fields feeling as if nothing could touch me and at times waking up to a fresh cut grass smell and just walking on the cricket pitch with my coffee and a mate feeling just pure happiness, not having to worry about a thing..but since i came into the states, i havnt been able to find that pureness of just being happy, yeah ive had some sweet times here, but i still don't think ive been able to find those few people to just bond with and keep close too...real mates. So many friends that i have that i havnt even been able to get to know. This year has been hectic, but who knows maybe come summer 2005 things may change (im backpacking through Europe). cheezy as it may sound, maybe love will be on the other side, maybe its in front of my face and i just havn't made the right move or said the right words yet..But all i know is im right here doing the things ive wanted to do, saying the things i wanna say, being the person that i am. 

New Zealand is where the heart is at, but i must say Europe is the place that im meant to be in..."

Then i walk up to the guys car as he stopped to a red light and was like you didnt see me, so we exchange a few words and his girlfriend raises her voice as well, so he gets pissed comes out the car wanting to fight me, so this PUNJABI! puts his star key in between his 2 fingers trying to stab me with it so what do i do, wack him 5 times with my skateboard, this guy is like 25 min..way bigger then me, but he dropped like a stone. then he got one good hit on me which cut into the side of my head, next thing i know im walking to the store and i just see blood trickling down the side of my face and im like ""oh wow"" so i get tissue wipe it up, bandage it up and off i go to go skating with my friends, but just imagine he rammed his key into my body like my throat or something, I COULD HAVE DIED! lol..crazy indian people man always looking to cut,slash,behead somebody lol..ahh well it was pretty cool, 2 close encounters, i feel like i cheated death twice lol..HAHA I WIN!<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v306/buffalosouljah/booboo3.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">"

"event","im thinking and can't sleep so i decided to write...I call this...

The Azaleas Sleep

I want to find you 
And be struck silent the first time I see you 
Struck in awe by your beauty 
Cautious by never hesistant in your presence 

I watch the azaleas rise every morning 
Greeting eachother and spending every second of sunlight together 
Only to fall asleep side by side in the night 
Comfort by the warmth of a silouhette which the moon provides 

I dont think thats so much to ask for from the guardian angels of love 
For my needs are miniscule 
My greed is only human emotion 
No more, certainly no less 

I see you in dreams 
Illuminating my sky 
Shooting stars never fall when you are my night 
The immediate proximity of your heat calms my nerves 

Lord...if I ask you for only one thing, its to never let her leave, never let her fall from the grace she so inherits from you 

I want to find you 
And I am scared as each year passes, thinking that you may not come save me 
I need to discover your embrace 
Because I am cold 
Four seasons flourish, but this winter has lasted to long 
And hope only goes so far before it is broken like lovers who were married to early 

Bring me a new life 
Let this bush expose its beauty with just one other flower 
I would beg for eternity, but never accept an offer thats not worthy of her 

Thats not you 
Until then 
I will practice my words that I will speak when we meet 
And cry just one tear for every thought that I dream of you"

1) paint room nice orange with black boarders, creme ceiling

2) new bed with a curtain around it with a red light over the bed (when i want to feel sexy)

3) put much of my art work/poetry on the walls, photos

4) make a shoe holder attached to the wall and a skateboard holder on the wall.

*these are ideas going i play, i can't wait...this will be such a better room than what it is now*

so i started writting music to some basic chords on the guitar and im finding it alot easier to write to my own music on guitar rather than to an musician..and i recently bought a painting from Lanre Adefioye ahh great day, nice ending.

Let me cut to the chase, we are having an awesome skate session at 12th and A, so errol approaches me and he is like that kid is saying shit about you cause your chinese, and im like you got a problem? he get gangsta so you know im like ok you got 2 options, option A - you apologize and walk away..option B - i beat the shit out of you and your friends by myself..so of course he apologizes so he walks away and he is like yo ima get my brotha, so i run up to him and im like yeah get your brother huh? **BOOOM BBOOM** i lit him up with a nice punch and all you see is a little blood and spit fly out his mouth, then he tries to run away so i chase him throw him to the fence and light his ass up even more..felt so good to beat up this kid cause he was like yeah im in a gang bleh bleh bleh, he got his bum bum whipped lol.

soo bottom line GREAT skate, NICE fight, Cops searching for me in squad cars all over downtown (no joke), i wont lie i was a little nervous once i seen all these squad cars looking around the park and asking people about a fight. but i made it safe back to queens and now im home telling a story. OH WAIT (sorry i gotta add this lol) his friends ditched his ass so fast once they seen me beating the shit out him lol.

"event","Today was the perfect type of day, Very nice weather with a little snow early in the day which was great..wasn't to cold :) snow i guess you could say adds that romantic touch to everything  *don't you think?*. School was pretty fun for a friday, i was in a good mood this morning, had Tennis early which started me off good, had my coffee and i was ready for the world. I met someone new today as i walking the halls, but i dont see that going anywhere, i felt as if i knew her before i met her..like she was too predictable, i need to talk to someone who doesnt come off to people so fast.

Scary thing that happened today was this girl from myspace who i had no idea went to my school came up by my class room and was like come here (so i was thinking i was getting lucky, i was like WHOA someone is SHOUTING ME OUT! but..that wasnt the case, she was like i know you from myspace**freaked me out**, so im thinking of putting the space to an end) i feel slightly uncomfortable now because i dont know who will run up on me in the streets lol.

crazy crazy crazy..but now im staying home on a friday trying to figure out things. and i plan on staying up all night writing a love song on the guitar for the non-existing lover lol. oh well i know she's out there rolling around the hay. i just gotta wait my turn, she is out there just learning what the contrast of you it gets. lol

oh well Mahalo!"

"event","So today my friend got the rental car and it was one of my favorite cars...THE MINI COOPER! ahh he let me drive it through B..E..A..UTIFUL forest hills and damn this car is pretty quick, nice and small. pretty fun day, didnt really skate much..CUT the coffee today down to 2 cups..and check this out.

I walk into school with a cupa and the security guard is like ""shooooooot i hope you dont plan on be walking in here wit DAT!"" and im like its coffee?..and she goes ""drink it on dat side of the scanner not this side"" so im like what the hell is the segregation or something!?! its not black and white days anymore.. bottom line beach channel got so strict and ""lawful"" that i am not allowed to bring in a cup of coffee because it might spill and hurt someone nor am i allowed to bring in anything else, but i walk in with a screw driver? hmm so here is a nice slogan

BEACH CHANNEL! No coffee allowed cause god forbid you burn your upper lip, but you are welcome to bring screw drivers? *you can kill someone with a screw driver, dont they know that?*

oh well school sucks but the mini cooper joy ride through my favorite queens spot forest hills made my day."

"event","So after everything ive been through i only just got into the whole college thing and i dont even know what i want to do..i wanna be a journalist, i had this dream where i was a writer in a big magazine company of the time *strange i thought* i don't know why but im not worried at all about college, i see all my friends and they're scared about college because they dont think they'll make it through it. who knows?

Today some kids were just grilling the shit out of me, so i was like something you like this way. I thought they were definitly gonna jump me, and in all honesty i got this good feeling and this big adrenaline rush and i had zero % fear running through me, like i was ready and confident i could take these 3 people on myself. Felt new. They never did anything to me, i just stood my ground looking each of them dead in the eyes. They just left (wierd huh?)

its like fear is not even a option in my mind anymore, It's like im not scared to lose..Maybe cause i came to realize i dont have much to lose. Also i will add that it is only 8:15 pm and i already had 5 cups of coffee, woke up 4:30 am left the house with my mom went to go play tennis with these ukrainian people at the USTA in flushing from 5:30 till 7am (really good way to start my day)

I noticed im seeing things differently in life, its a new strange way.......but i like it"

"event","i walk the streets with my head up high thinking that just one day...one day the feeling would be back, I'm gonna keep searching for you no matter the odds. Every Journey begins with a fare, before i was just on the wrong track living the wrong life..but i went back downstairs and now im on the other side, looking at life in a new perspective, for once im on the right track. So now i just have to be patient and wait for you to come by my stop again, or am i on the train of love waiting to arrive at your stop?"

"event","*sigh* Dating...well ive been dating for a little over 1 month now, but i dont know if its just me but some girls maybe real beautiful and my friends may think im dumb for not going out with them, but they dont see it the way i see it..i just need a mysterious girl, who i dont know too much about so i could spend time getting to know them..thats for starters...its like i can predict what will happen next (i dislike that so much)...at times i wish i could just be in love, find someone, its so hard nowadays to find someone who will just accept the things you do..i mean everyone ive dated just tried to change me, i mean why? is there anyone for me? is there anyone who will accept my ways? is there anyone with a great sense of humour? where is my mystery girl? i know you but i don't...will you see my true colours?

"event","so i wake up with a massive head ache as if someone had just dropped an anvil on my head **ahh hurt so bad** so i figure ok let me lay down for a half an hour and it'll go..eventually my headache went away so im like ok let me go skate (big mistake) my body today just wasn't functioning right? its like a had a serious case of slow disease or something lol. So im skating the city and things are going well, everyone is filming runs, so im like ok let me film this run, but the filmer didnt wanna film so all of my friends are like let me film him and then the filmer goes fuck that kid... fuck that kid? (whoa) here i am thinking this kid is a close friend but dont get me wrong this isnt the only time, this is everytime...but i must say this filmer i skate with is a very nice con-artist, but he isnt fooling me, he will eventually see he is losing a good friend, but hey thats his loss..ahh well over all the day was good things went ok with the exception of the whole filmer situation.. goodnight...

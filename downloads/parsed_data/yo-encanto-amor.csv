"event","LAST DAY OF SCHOOL! sorta i just have 1 exam tomorrow and 1 exam on friday so today is the last real day for me and i haven't done anything at all. I have guard tryouts this afternoon, i'm not really nervous...maybe i should be but i'm not. I can do the routine and i know what i'm doing and i think the judges will be able to tell that. Eh i dunno. Boys boys boys. Don't flirt with boys from howe or they'll think you love them and want a serious relationship when all you wanted was a little entertainment on the 9 million hour bus ride home. that's my words of wisdom for the day. i'm going to see star wars tonight after tryouts with my new youth group WOOO for Summit. except it's basically the core youth group from my old church but still it's cool but it's on the dl. anywho i get out at 2 today bc i don't have to take my 6th period exam which is awesome. and summer's going to be fun i hope. i need to get a job i might have a babysitting job but i don't know yet i was suppose to meet with the lady today but i had to call and cancel on account of me have tryouts and completely forgetting about them. I bet i won't get nervous until right as i walk in to do it. who cares it's no big deal...if i don't make it just means i won't be in band and won't have long boring marching practices so wooo it's a good deal either way. Ok well i guess i'll go...i'm bored with writing and i think the bell's about to ring."

"event","ok so i ended up have tons of fun on the San Marcos Trip and it didn't rain anytime that we were outside which made me happy. School is almost over! YAYAYAYAYAYAY! it's really sad because today is the senior's last day and i'm really going to miss some of them. it's so weird that they'll never be here again. What's weirder is that next year that's going to be me and my friends. I'M GOING TO BE A SENIOR!!!!!! that's just weird. Ok well i finally made my decision and i've decided that i'm leaving FBC Howe and going to Summit. i'm really happy.

"event","ok so i'm updating...i never write because i lead a pretty lame life i had interest for about 3 weeks but i couldn't write about that b/c it was a secret! (secret boys are fun) but now i'm back to boringness and i'm in a bad mood and no one wants to read a bunch of random bitching that gets boring not to mention annoying. We're going to San Marcos this weekend which would be fun if i could get in a better mood and not be out of it all weekend, but i looked up the weather and there's a 60% chance it's going to rain on sunday which totally sucks A. maybe it won't, but i'm not having luck lately. oh well i don't really feel like walking about in my swimsuit all day anyways me and my body don't agree lately. i'm so ready for school to get out. i can't wait. i think i'm going to get a jobfor the summer i got an application for old navy and that would be cool cause i love that store and a discount would be fan-tabulous. ok so anyways i'm done for now...how'd ya like that?!?!"

Your birth on the 16th day of the month gives a sense of loneliness and generally the desire to work alone. 

You are relatively inflexible, and insist on your being independent. 

You need a good deal of time to rest and to meditate. 



You are introspective and a little stubborn. 

Because of this, it may not be easy for you to maintain permanent relationships, but you probably will as you are very much into home and family. 

This birth day inclines to interests in the technical, the scientific, and to the religious or the unknown realm of spiritual explorations. 



The date gives you a tendency to seek unusual approaches and makes your style seem a little different and unique to those around you. 

Your intuition is aided by the day of your birth, but most of your actions are bedded in logic, responsibility, and the rational approach. 

You may be emotional, but have a hard time expressing these emotions. 

Because of this, there may be some difficulty in giving or receiving affection.</td>

Look at the prettyness of these lyrics-

I don't want to introduce you to my friends, 'cause I think they'll get the wrong idea. 
You're so fetching in that dress - They'll think we have messed around 
And though I'll tell them otherwise, I was gone all night with you. 
What most people do will be running through their heads. 
They don't need to see that I met a pretty girl last night.
I'm 19, and I've kissed 2 girls that's all. 
You're 16, and you're one... Is that against the law? 


it's more amazing when you hear his sing it with his hot voice!"

"event","so i had my first sleezy pick up line used on me on Friday night! i was so excited. I've never actually heard a guy use a sleezy pick up line before but it was so funny! Me and Cassie were going to the Frisco mall and we were on 380 and this guy (who was 19) waved at me so i waved back and then we did the whole cars passing each other back and forth thing and me and Cassie thought it was hilarious. Then at the stop light right before we turn on to 289 we were sitting right beside each other and he rolled down his window and he had like three of his friends with him and they were about as giggly as me and cassie cause boys are dumb and he tried to get me to give him my number and i wouldn't and then we talked back and forth for like 1 minute and then he used the ickiest pickup line known to man and sped off b/c the light changed. It was grand fun. Boys can be such idgits. oh well it was the craziest thing i've done shows how lame i am lol. But i wanted to share it  with everyone cause i knew you'd be interested!

I'm not so sure what it is that i'm angry about it changes from hour to hour and some hours i'm not angry at anything just wading in a pool of enragment. i want to be happy and not feel like crap. i want to stop snapping at people and i don't want to walk around with a scowl on my face and feel like crying tears of anger every 2 seconds. I either wish i could find a reason behind my anger or just stop being angry. Like now i'm not that angry but i'm just not me- i'm like cynical me. i can't be sweet and cute and not annoyed no matter how hard i try. the best thing for me to do is to just keep my mouth shut and not say anything mean to anybody. i don't know if this entry makes any sense or if it's just me rambling on and on so i'm very very sorry to have bored those who chose to read this!!"

"event","ok so i haven't written in forever!!! mostly b/c my life has gotten pretty dull. absolutly nothing intersting has happened. Oh don't get me wrong-there's been some drama but nothing of much interest to anyone after it happens. Christmas break was fun because i never did a thing. But then again that's the problem-i didn't do ANYTHING!! how dull am i? oh i guess i did do one thing- everywhere i went i got asked the annoying question- ""do you have a boyfriend?"" that was followed by a pitiful-""no not yet!! but it's ok i'm too busy for a boy!"" which is a total lie- but then that was responded to by a ""oh-i'm sorry...don't worry-it'll happen someday..."" and the funny thing was was that at the time i was perfectly fine w/o a boyfriend. i'm never happy when i have one, but now it's like all i can freaking think about! cause everywhere i go someone brings it up!! actually by now it's gotten to where my mom usually has to answer because i go into a fit of hysterical laughter. oh well. we have finals this week and finals suck so much. i had part of my english 6 weeks exam yesterday the rest of it today a history test tomorrow, my english final exam thursday and my precal exam friday!!! i'm so sick of tests. they stress me out like none other. i can't wait until summer.  and then after summer it'll be senior year and senior year is going to be so much easier than junior year. but the bad thing is that as of friday i am only half way done with junior year. i feel like it's never gonna end. I'm just trying ot think of all the things i have to look forward too. Just like 2 months until spring break, then we have spring trip, and we have prom. I haven't decided if i'm excited about prom yet or not. i only tends to spur people into asking the  ""do you have a boyfriend question"" or the ""do you have a date"" question both of which will have to be sadly answered with a big fat NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh well...maybe some other girls won't have dates and we'll go in a big group and then a least i'll get to get a pretty dress and that's always fun. ok well i've written a pretty dumb entry but it'll give someone something to read it they ever get bored!"

"event","OMG gossip gets around. Today is the blood drive so people who gave blood have stickers that say ""kiss me i gave blood"" well dusty wouldn't move at the end of band unless i gave him a kiss on the cheek cause he gave blood, so i did, it was no big deal. 2 seconds ago here in the middle of 4th period a freshmen was talking to me and goes ""so i heard you gave dusty a kiss"" wtf?? dusty and this freshmen don't really ever talk and even if they do Dusty wouldn't have had time to tell him that. I don't get it...howe has like some secret gossip website or something. Oh and i made out with Kreyton on Friday-not even that much and already everybody's been asking about us. It's like omg! apparently in howe ur not allowed to makeout out of wedlock. it's insane. And if when people ask about me and kreyton i'm like we're not really a thing it was just soemthing to do everyone is like in a quandary...sorry i've been studying like mad for mrs. Hughes' english test that i have 6th period and that's one of the vocab words.  I really hope i do well on that test i'm not too worried about the multiple choice but i am worried about the G/M part, i suck at g/m sentences. I just want to get this test over with that and my physics test i have in about 5 minutes which i didn't study for half as much as i should have so i'm a little worried about that and i really really have to have a good grade on it so i don't make a b in that class. i hate tests...oh and i hate gossip."

It was nice to be in all of that and feel normal instead of always being on the outside of stuff like that. Like the convo me and my girlies were having in debate and journalism this morning about how i'm the most virginal one of the group- that's awesome and cool and stuff b/c i know i'm not prepared to do any of that stuff and right now it's not God's plan for me and stuff, i just feel left out sometimes b/c it's like a whole different world that they know about that i don't know about. It doesn't really bother me like it used to i just have mixed feelings about it and stuff. who knows...this entry doesn't really make any sense except to me...so yeah just ignore it."

"event","i hate high school b/c of gpa's if they were nonexistent i would be so happy. The counselor has been passing out gpa's to everybody which puts the focus on them and i hate talking about it. I can't stand having to say that i am number one but it could all come crashing down and then having to justify why it matters to me so much and then having to hear what people think about it and hear who they thought was number one and who should be and it just plays with my head and i don't like it. It's like the one thing that just messes with my head more then anything. I really really wish that form day one in life i had been a slacker and then none of this would be a problem. i know this is a really annoying post about a poor little smart girl but it's like that whole poor little rich girl thing- being smart isn't all it's cracked up to be...i'm going crazy trying to please myself."

So now i have to do my 4 million pounds of homework and go to a pointless guard practice!!!!!!!!!! it's so effing frustrating. And boys are so effing immature...they get on my nerves!!! I swear ever since i've started being around guys i've started noticing how dumb they are about relationships. i think they're more stuck on them then girls are. Like the guys at my lunch table during lunch they talk to their girlfriends on the phone and decide big relatioship issues and during the day they have fights texting back and forth to each other! it's effing insane!!! that would get on my nerves like none other. maybe that's why i don't have a boyfriend. slowly it's all coming too me...oh well. i'll find some one soon enough. but i don't have time i have to force myself to do my homework, if i had a boyfriend i'd just use it as one more excuse not to do my homework."

But soon things all came crashing down i really don't want to get into it, i don't like posting the really really personal stuff like this for just anybody and everybody to read it makes for a total collapse in my universe if the wrong person happens to stumble across it. so i'll just give a quick thing and those of you who know me can just figure it out from there or ask me. so the guy i've like since like forever who happened to be my oh so perfect homecoming date took me to the dance saturday and got back with his ex gf on sunday. i'm not mad or hurt i'm just sad and i don't even know why exactly. i like him a lot and stuff but i knew going into it that me and him weren't gonna go out. i can just tell these things. and it's hard for me bc i'm not angry at him and i still like him. usually when a guy doesn't like me back i find some assine reason to get really pissed off at him and i go around cussing about him and just being a bitch anytime i talk about him but this time i still like him. and i'm not mad in the least bit just sad. cause this time it's different. it's not the same as all those other stupid boys. i really like this one and it's not just about having a guy not like me. i have plenty of guys that like me and plenty of guys to flirt with. but it was all about having THE guy. you know that certain one that makes you go weak in the knees everytime he looks your way and everytime he talks to u you go home happy and when your with him everyone can tell that your happy and they see the real you and you're finally exactly the kind of girl you want to be when your with them. yeah he's that guy for me, and don't think i'm being all dramatic about this and got all of this from saturday night, nope this is from the past 5 years of my life. it's just something about him he's different to me then any other boy. oh well now that i've written like the most corny movie love teen love sh*t in the world i feel a little depressed. so on a lighter note i'd like to mention that the band did freakin awesome at contest yesterday and made straight one's which is a total gift from God. And the colorguard kicked some major A! we did awesome you would have never thought we'd be as good as we are this year after the disaster that was last year. We are awesome we made some big mistakes but all the awesome stuff we did completely outweighed the bad. i'm so happy this is thursday i took my last test for the week this morning in precal. i think i did ok not as good as i would want to bc i had to leave one of the answers blank cause i couldn't get one of the answers. but it's only one and i'm pretty sure i did almost all the others right and i answered half of that question so hopefully i'll get partial credit.  I took my spanish test yesterday and i think i did rockin awesome for only studying in the class before it. and then i also took a physics test on tuesday and i think i did ok..we'll see but i didn't walk out of the room crying or thinking that i completely fail but you never know. wow i've written a ton!!! this is what happens when i put off writing for a week. well i'm gonna go and i'll post more later..."

I decided to take it upon myself and give myself the role as the annoying person walking around all day laying pple and thinking it's funny. and it is. we had to take the stupid psat test today and it took forever but the good news is we got out of a day of us history and precal! so wooooo! oh and the good news it came on monday and for some reason i never wrote about it. i have a date to homecoming!!!!!!!!!!!!! i know i was gonna go alone and go with all my girlies but come on! shane asked me! i can't possibly say no to the guy i've liked since the 8th grade no normal person would.  i'm really excited and trying my hardest not to freak out. i do that a lot if no one's noticed. omg i think i have a.d.d or o.c.d like today during the test i couldn't concentrate because all i could concentrate on was the guy that was sitting next to me breathed loudly and it was so freaking distracting and it was all i could hear and i was going completly insane sitting there listening to that! and then once i got over that (after we had like a ten minute break) all i could hear was different little noises all around me like a buzzing noise and somebody scratching their arm and it was all driving me crazy but i kept zoning out and not listening to myself read the questions and then i would have no clue how to answer. Then after lunch i started feeling like complete crap (girl issues)but now i feel better. Oh and i smell like boy b/c i'm wearing shane's lay (however you spell it) and it smells like his cologne. I like it. oh and tonight is couch o rama and it's gonna be freaking awesome. so everbody in the entire world should come!!! oh well the bell is about to ring!"

Jessica hit her nose last night when we were doing the cool throw in the second song and it's kind of swollen today. i feel so sorry for her! that is actually one of my biggest fears with that throw! i just know i'm gonna hit my nose at contest and like it's gonna break it and then i'll be out on the field with a bloody nose in intense pain. it's an actual fear i have at the moment. i know it's dumb but u gotta think about this stuff....if i don't who will?? Last night we got out of practice like 20 minutes early and so i took erin home and we ended up talking for an hour in my car infront of her house. I have no clue how we find that much stuff to say all the time and it's like we hardly ever repeat the same stuff twice!!! we talked all through guard practice being goofy and then had an hour's worth of serious talk after that. we're amazing. we decided that for new year's this year that we have to have a boy to kiss at midnight...that's my pre-new year's resolution...and it WILL happen.  it has too. now i just have to figure out which boy i want...well to be honest i already know that lol i just have to make that happen..which i can do...it's on it's way..."

"event","it rained all last night and this morning and now it's all icky outside. My hair is crappy and the bottoms of my new jeans are still kind of damp from walking in this morning. Nothing big has happened today. friday night going to and from the game i got to sit with that certain hot band member i was talking about in my last entry. He's really sweet, i love talking to him and stuff and oh yeah did i mention that i think he's really cute?? He fell asleep on my shoulder on the way home which is cute. But it's weird cause guys are always falling asleep on my shoulder or laying their head on my shoulder...it's weird it should be the other way around. lol This is like day six of having no purpose or meaning in my life...it's so depressing. I haven't actually taken a breath in like almost a week!!! no not really. I got new clothes on saturday i love my new jeans and my new belt and my new shirt and my homecoming shoes and necklace and earrings. Yesterday i got another new pair of jeans! i was at kims house and we were cutting my ae jeans on the sides and she started showing me her jeans that she'd cut and then she got out all of her lei stretch jeans that she won't wear anymore cause she thinks they look funny and she had 20 pairs!!! and one pair still had the tags on them and so i decided to try them on and they fit cause me and kim wear the same size her dad just hems hers up and bc she'd never worn these they were normal length so she gave them to me! so i got 2 new pairs of jeans this weekend for the price of one. yeah for me. don't be mad jen! lol i even get new jeans when i don't go shopping pple just give them to me lol.  oh well the bells about to ring so i gotta go!"

Today is also early release which makes it a good day and it's a friday and raining so that means RAIN GAME!!!!! it's gonna be so much fun! I'm excited, i rarely get a reason to sit in the freezing rain for like 3 hours! it's going to be so much fun!!!!! Me and my friends have been making a big deal about me having absolutly no purpose in life now that i'm single. It's hilariously funny and it makes kim like soooo mad b/c like everytime i say it she thinks i'm serious which only makes it even funnier. I don't think i'm worthless because i don't have a bf. i'm having so much fun and stuff i'm so excited about this game and it's not just because of a certain hot band member i'm truly happy which is like so much better then last friday when i was like dreading the game and stuff. oh well i'm just droning on and on so i'm gonna go work on my precal homework or something."

"event","today i feel so annoyed by everything and everybody i even annoy myself. it's weird and i hate this feeling. it's almost a feeling of that i'm trying too hard or something so all i want to do is go home and lay under the covers of my bed with the tv going in the background and bask in the fact that i'm in love with the hottest guy in our school and i can't even figure out if even remotely likes me. UGH!!!!!!!!!! i'm so annoying. i need to stop typing right now b4 i annoy anybody and everybody who's reading this who at the moment i think is only erin. I'm ready for this weekend and tomorrow to go to the game i think it'll be a lot of fun if i can get into a good mood. which i think i can maybe i'll feel better by tomorrow night. Guard is getting on my nerves!!! for some reason changing flags gets on my last nerve cause it's like so confusing and no one ever does it right and we never ever actually have time to do it so it only gets halfway done and when we switch flags the jv has to switch flags and they never do it so it always me doing it or asking repeatedly for someone else to do it. And we never have enough tape or can't find the tape or someone uses the wrong flag and it's always just a big mess and it drives me insane!!!!!!!!i can't stand it for some reason and some people on the guard always want to switch the flags and i don't like that. so that gets on my nerves. And nobody's going to like those sleeves we're getting so we're gonna go look at them tomorrow and everybody's gonna be all ""ewww i can't stand those"" but nobody will even remotely listen to what me and emily have to say but it's gonna be a big huge deal in a couple of weeks at least that's what i think it might be. and this is annoying to me oh and also i realized that i say freakin all the time and i want to stop cause that's annoying and dumb and stuff so i need to stop saying that. I don't feel like myself here lately and i just want to get back to being me but the problem is i don't know how. it's usually a really long hard process and i don't have time to go through that long process nor do i have the time. Oh well atleast my lunch is fun i was really scared that i would totally hate lunch this year and stuff but it's actually likes so much fun. We go into the band hall after we eat and joke around in there. omg i don't think i'm ever wearing this shirt again. the words go right across my chest and all day i've caught guys just like staring at it i know they're reading it and stuff but good lord they read slow after a little while it's almost annoying. oh well i think i've whined enough for one class period."

I feel kind of weird about it, it 's hard to explain. But at the same time it's nice to know i could makeout with any one i wanted to and not be cheating. Not that i'd do that or anything since last time i was checking there's not a whole lot out there worth randomly making out with...at least i haven't met any. oh well i'm happy cause i kicked major a on my english essay and now i may not fail her class. I think i did ok on my us history test this morning and i might do ok on my physics test if i would freakin study!!!!! but this is much more important at the moment. i know my friends think i'm a total loser cause i'm alone again lol i guess i'll just have to make up a bf...i wonder is bane (stacie's bf *wink wink) has a brother or a friend. Oh wait i've got it...i'll just talk about jim now! I got to talk to him last night for like the first time in forever and he's sooo sweet! i was gonna post part of the convo but i forgot to save it!! i hope i get to meet him eventually. he's sweet and cute and funny and jen says me and him would make a good couple. but who knows what's gonna happen. I feel like this year anything could happen good or bad. I think a lot of good things are gonna happen but you have to take the good with the bad so who knows. well i seriously have to look over my physics notes! i'll post more later or tomorrow. oh wait omg i forgot something- when i start to like a guy i get really really freaked out that they don't like me and they're annoyed with me and they just want me to go away and i don't know why and i'm starting to get all paranoid like that and stuff. huh i'm weird."

I don't really want to go to the game tonight it doesn't seem like it's gonna be fun and the band sucks today for some reason so we will march out onto the field and make fools of ourselves, it should be grand fun. Tomorrow night i'm going to spend the night with jen. For some reason i just wanna get out of howe! i feel like i just need to leave even if it is just for an evening and a morning. i'm starting to totally rock at this whole ""running away from your problems"" thing. Pretty soon i'm gonna be the master at is it. I'm good at that and making my problems go away by creating more even bigger problems.  i just can't do anything right here lately and that's all i wanna do, just one thing that is completely and utterly right nothing wrong or anything about it. in all actuality i want shane to damelo! jk well not really but it's just a joke me and him have.  the boys all look so pretty today all dressed up maybe one in particular but i'm not saying any names.lol see all of this talk is just taking my problems and making them turn into even more gigantic problems.  I should just go live in a cave then not only would i be running away but i could not create any new problems. i need to stop whining and and get on with my day enough of this stupid little sob story i'm starting to annoy myself."

I'm so tired of school each one of my friends has had a breakdown one day this week. I haven't broken down at school yet *knock on wood* but i'm a complete basket case of emotion at home and i freaked out at guard last night and kimberly had to like hold me and calm me down b/c i was crying so hard. So my eyes hurt too b/c of all the crying. I have a precal test tomorrow a spanish test friday a history paper due tomorrow and whatever they decide to give us in physics and english.

My head is killing me and i think i'm dying. If this kills me i love you all.  DRAMA IS SATAN!!!!!!!!!! apparently i've done something to offend stacie and i have no clue other than liking her crush but sarah swears up and down it has nothing to do with that boy so what the eff did i do??? no one will tell me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good lord people must think i'm really dumb b/c they walk off to the bathroom and think that i don't know they're going to talk about me they give each other looks when i say stuff but you know what i do see that stuff!!!!!! i have eyes and a brain. well i used to unless this whole lack of oxygen thing has killed all the brain cells i once had. Oh yeah then there's this whole thing that i can't get up the courage do and so i ignore my bf which is a bitchy bitchy thing to do but i can't handle all of this! i'm only one person! oh and i also went off on this band director guy we had last night b/c he said my arms were long among other things. more later!"

"event","omg!!!!!!!!!!!! things go from bad to worse for me! i have this thing where i dig myself into a hole so deep that no one can ever get out.  It's really amazing the way i do it. Oh well i talked to kim about all this for like an hour and a half last night and she's gonna help me get out of it bc she's been there b4.  I haven't talked to the guy i have a crush on all day b/c i'm trying to get over him b/c a) i don't have time for a bf so it wouldn't work out anyways b) someone else likes him and i totally can't do that b/c it would start like world war three of drama. and c) i don't think he's who i should be with. Yes, it would be a lot of fun and it'd be so nice cause no one would think i'd ever do that but i don't want that reputation. But i really need to end one boy before i start on another boy. You'd think i'd know that...supposedly i'm smart but based off of the past few weeks you totally wouldn't know it.  ok well i know what i need to do and what is right for me and i just need to do it. but that's so hard!!!!!!!! and i don't want to!!!! it's so nice to be normal and by having a bf it's so much easier to make fun of sarah lol ...like this one time when my bf did BLAH BLAH BLAH!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh well someone else will come along and i'll freak out about that relationship and end it too. it's just my destiny. Someday though, i have faith that my prince charming with come and i won't freak out (or i will) but he won't let me give up and i won't feel weird about it and it'll all be good and stuff.  atleast that's what i tell myself. eh ohwell..good lord i'm pathetic this is the dumbest entry ever. all i do is whine whine whine about having a bf when next week all i'll do is whine whine whine about not having a bf. oh well it's what i do best."

(i think mundo is a cool word) i feel like breaking out in a little verse of american hi-fi ""the art of losing"" cause that's how i feel right now...that song is so what i'm gonna do one day when i have a breakdown in the middle of some random class at school.  Then everybody will remember me for sure! eh this is a stupid school. who cares how well i do it's a flippin 2a nothingsville school. big flippin woo if i'm at the top of my class in the real world that means absolutly nothing. all that means is that for 5 minutes at my high school graduation i get to stand infront of the whole gay community and say a speech and the crazy thing is I HATE PUBLIC SPEAKING!!!!!!!!!!! so why do i care. even if i'm good enough to graduate number one all i'm gonna hear is ""I thought so&so was number one not her""  ""they must have done something wrong...she's dumb isn't she"" so what the hell do i care. I'm not even gonna see any of these people after high school and after that 5 minute speech at graduation no one is ever ever ever gonna ask me my class rank again. so basically i have spent the last year of my life wasted on worrying about whether or not i'm gonna graduate at the top of my class for a FRICKIN FIVE MINUTE SPEECH!!!!!!!!!!!!! it's so retarded. no i'm retarded for even wanting that. who gives a crap about class rank anymore cause i sure as hell don't."

I've promised so many pple i'd do stuff with them i don't have time to do anything this weekend. And it's totally cool hangin out with pple and I like bein with pple but i'm a me person. I need a lot of me time. Time where it's just me at home layin on my bed or watchin tv not where i'm getting ready to go do something or waiting for the next event to come around. I just don't work like that. And then at the end of the weekend i'm more exhausted than i was when the weekend started only to start a whole new week with little or no rest. I don't work this way i'm not good at it and i guess this is why i've spent my first 2 years of high school being lame and sittin at home on saturday nights. it's an all or nothin kind of life. either you have to be into doing everything with everybody or doing absolutly nothing with no one. all i know is i need more rest not really sleep just rest - to me there's a difference. ohwell i guess enough ranting for the moment...wait i just thought of something else...only to make matters worse i have a new crush lol and i think it'd be a good match for something fun but someone else we know likes him *hint* and he's younger then me *another hint* and oh yeah...i'm not single kind of a problem and i think God is trying to keep us apart, everytime we try to talk something goes wrong like today i couldn't find my math paper and totally freaked out walked away from him and last night he called right as i was about to eat and watch Scrubs on tv and i couldn't talk to him and then there was one other time i don't remember. I dunno...life is crap and like i said yesterday at guard practice i'm a bia sometimes..and for this relationship i'd be a complete and totally bia to more then one person. but.........i liiiiiikkkkeeee himmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!! he makes me laugh. ohwell i'll write more lata!"

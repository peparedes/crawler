And another thing, I've stopped going to libraries. Before I used to go to about 4 libraries regularly and borrow the maximum amount but I've now preferred to buy my books and collect them. Anyway, I'm still going to continue my book list through 2005 in this journal. 

I know I've read 2 or 3 more books in November but I seriously can't remember what they were and I lost my list. Surely they're not that memorable. 

Currently reading:

*A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin - Book 1 of the Song of Ice and Fire series. 
*Set This House in Order - Matt Ruff

Happy Holidays everyone and keep reading! :-D"

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

From #1 bestseller David Baldacci comes a new thriller reminiscent of his phenomenal bestselling debut, Absolute Power.It was only a split second--but that's all it took for Secret Service agent Sean King's attention to wander and his ""protectee,"" third-party presidential candidate Clyde Ritter, to die. King retired from the Service in disgrace, and now, eight years later, balances careers as a lawyer and a part-time deputy sheriff in a small Virginia town. Then he hears the news: Once again, a third-party candidate has been taken out of the presidential race--abducted right under the nose of Secret Service agent Michelle Maxwell. King and Maxwell form an uneasy alliance, and their search for answers becomes a bid for redemption as they delve into the government's Witness Protection Program and the mysterious past of Clyde Ritter's dead assassin. But the truth is never quite what it seems, and these two agents have learned that even one moment looking in the wrong direction can be deadly. Full of shocking twists and turns, and introducing a villian to rival Jackson in Baldacci's The Winner, SPLIT SECOND is pure, mind-numbing adrenaline to the last page.</font>

<i><font size=-2>Book Description</i>

Eighteen months after her ordeal at the hands of the sadistic 'Stiletto Murderer', fashion model and forensic psychology student Makedde Vanderwall must confront her demons when she returns to Sydney for the trial. But just as the verdict is handed down, the unthinkable happens -- the killer makes a daring escape, aided and abetted by a twisted accomplice that no one suspected ... 

Mak is terrified, and ex-boyfriend Detective Andy Flynn, who has a bad habit of employing more madness than method in his work, isn't helping. She decides to leave the country, but the press dog her every move, hindering her safe passage and unknowingly helping the Stiletto Murderer, who's busy rekindling an old fetish ... her ... 

Where can she run? Who can she trust? And has she, and the police, underestimated Australia's most notorious serial killer yet again? Sharper than a Manolo four-inch heel, sexier than a Versace fashion show, and more risky than all seven deadly sins, Covet will set your pulse racing. -- from Tara's website.</font>

R - ***

I've decided to try Tara Moss' thrillers again after giving up on her first book which was Fetish. Covet's storyline was actually very interesting although the ending sort of let down the entire book. I also like Makkede Vanderwall as a character. BUT her writing still needs a bit of improvement and polish - she's definitely not comparable to Cornwell (in her earlier novels) or Faye Kellerman. No way!

by Kim Wilkins
May 2004</a>

<font size=-1><i>Book Description</i>

Victoria Scott, scientist and hardened sceptic, accepts a job at an isolated weather station in the Norwegian Sea. But there are shadows outside her cabin window, rumours about a hag that visits in nightmares, and a disturbing sense of familiarity in the deep, haunted forest: almost as if she has connection with the island and its past.

In Asgard, the world of the old gods, Odin's son Vidar has exiled himself from his cruel family to await the reincarnation of his beloved; the woman that his father mercilessly slew a thousand years past. After centuries of waiting, the seeing-waters tell him that she has returned, and her name is Victoria.

Deep in the black, twisted roots of the World Tree, the three Norns spin and weave the fates of everyone. Vidar knows he must escape his destiny, but can only do so at enormous cost. Will he discover that fulfilling the heart's desire is a tragedy worse than death?</font>

Another wonderful fantasy thriller from Kim Wilkins - so much better than the first book in the series. More mature and sophisticated story. Recommended!"

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

Meet Rose Feller, a thirty-year-old high-powered attorney with a secret passion for romance novels. She has an exercise regime she's going to start next week, and she dreams of a man who will slide off her glasses, gaze into her eyes, and tell her she's beautiful. She also dreams of getting her fantastically screwed-up, semi-employed little sister to straighten up and fly right. 

Meet Rose's sister, Maggie. Twenty-eight years old and drop-dead gorgeous. Although her big-screen stardom hasn't progressed past her left hip's appearance in a Will Smith video, Maggie dreams of fame and fortune -- and of getting her big sister on a skin-care regimen. 

These two women, who claim to have nothing in common but a childhood tragedy, DNA, and the same size feet, are about to learn that they're more alike than they'd ever imagined. Along the way, they'll encounter a diverse cast of characters -- from a stepmother who's into recreational Botox to a disdainful pug with no name. They'll borrow shoes and clothes and boyfriends, and eventually make peace with their most intimate enemies -- each other. </font>

<i><font size=-2>Book Description</i>

Art restorer and sometimes spy Gabriel Allon is sent to Vienna to discover the truth behind a bombing that killed an old friend. But while there he encounters something that turns his world upside down. It is a face - a face that feels hauntingly familiar, a face that chills him to the bone and sends him on an urgent hunt for more: a name, a history, a connection. 

Each fact he uncovers, however, only leads to more questions: each layer hestrips away reveals more layers beneath. Finally, a picture begins to emerge, but one more terrible than he could have imagined, a portrait of evil stretching across sixty years and thousands of lives and into his own personal nightmares. Soon the quest for one monsters becomes the quest for many. And the monsters are stirring...

Filled with sharply etched characters and prose, and a plot of astonishing intricacy and resonance, this is an uncommonly intelligent thriller by one out our very best writers.</font>

January 1998</a>

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride is inspired by ""The Robber Bridegroom,"" a wonderfully grisly tale from the Brothers Grimm in which an evil groom lures three maidens into his lair and devours them, one by one. But in her version, Atwood brilliantly recasts the monster as Zenia, a villainess of demonic proportions, and sets her loose in the lives of three friends, Tony, 

Charis, and Roz. All three ""have lost men, spirit, money, and time to their old college acquaintance, Zenia. At various times, and in various emotional disguises, Zenia has insinuated her way into their lives and practically demolished them. 
To Tony, who almost lost her husband and jeopardized her academic career, Zenia is 'a lurking enemy commando.' To Roz, who did lose her husband and almost her magazine, Zenia is 'a cold and treacherous bitch.' To Charis, who lost a boyfriend, quarts of vegetable juice and some pet chickens, Zenia is a kind of zombie, maybe 'soulless'"" (Lorrie Moore, New York Times Book Review). In love and war, illusion and deceit, Zenia's subterranean malevolence takes us deep into her enemies' pasts.</font>

I'm in an Atwood collecting phase right now. After seeing new paperbacks of her books released in the bookstores, I vowed to get my hands on all of them. Robber Bride is the first and I thought it was great. I finished it in just two days! Remember how I said that Naomi was my most hated literary character ever? Well, I haven't met Zenia before that and Naomi is an angel compared to Zenia.

Cat's Eye will be next!"

February 2003</a>

Title in the US: Honor Lost: Love and Death in Modern-Day Jordan

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

I'd always believed that we'd spend our lives together...I never dreamed that my time with her would be cut short, or that my life would be a journey down this path, but I realize that she left me with a mission...I must find a way to make all Arab women's silent cries for justice and freedom heard around the world. 

Dalia was a young, beautiful Arabian Muslim living with her family in Amman, Jordan. At the age of twenty-five, she unexpectedly fell in love with Michael, a major in the Royal Army, and a Catholic. For a Muslim woman, any relationship with a Catholic man is forbidden, and Dalia was only too aware that flouting this rule could cost her her life. 

But they were deeply in love, and with the help of Dalia's lifelong friend, Norma, with whom she ran a hair salon, they went to extraordinary lengths to meet in secret. Dalia and Michael were only alone on a handful of occasions, and their relationship remained entirely chaste. Although they covered their tracks meticulously, one of Dalia's brothers became suspicious and she was suddenly gripped by the terrifying reality of what might happen to them all. 

Norma Khouri's book is a gift to the memory of her friend. In it she recounts a powerful love story that ends in an appalling tragedy, and also attempts to bring to the world's attention the continuing practice of honor killing in Jordan -- an ancient tradition that encourages the murder of women considered to have dishonored their families. It is a crime that effectively goes unpunished. 

Shocking and dramatic, Honor Lost will strike a chord with women everywhere and is a testimony to the courage and strength of women who are prepared to defy generations of male dominance.</font>

The most controversial book of the year so I just had to read it. Although the writing was very simple, I could imagine why it would move most readers. Unfortunately, it's all a hoax [not all honour killings but Norma's story]. 

Here are some of the latest headlines:

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

Are you a Spender, a Savvy or a Careful? The real answer might surprise you. (Hint: A lot more people think they belong in the Savvy group than really do.) Through years of helping thousands of Australians sort out their financial problems, Greg Smith has come to realise that everyone has a money personality which tends to one of these three types. Too many people don't even know which they are, and just repeat poor habits learnt in childhood. But it's never too late to change. Beginning with a quiz to help you identify your money, the book shows step by step how your unconscious habits could be holding you back from the life you want, how to solve your immediate financial woes and then how to build up the kind of assets that will give you the future you dream of.</font>

R - ***

I've been on the look-out for self-help books lately particularly about money and found this one immediately. Mind you, I didn't waste any money on it. I just borrowed it from the library. 

I'm not a big reader of self-help and empowerment books so I'm not sure how this compares to others. I found it quite enjoyable to read, however. Aside from quite a few tips on how to save (mostly commonsensical activities) and other financial information, there are also a lot of case studies that were interesting. However, if you're looking for an indepth book about how to be a millionaire, this is not it! There actually aren't any books for that. 

Note: I'm in the Spender category. As if I needed a book to tell me that. I started a money diary though. I'll see if it works or not."

""Greetings from the dead,"" declares Maxwell Broadbent on the videotape he left behind after his mysterious disappearance. A notorious treasure hunter and tomb robber, Broadbent accumulated over a half a billion dollars' worth of priceless art, gems, and artifacts before vanishing---along with his entire collection---from his mansion in New Mexico.

At first, robbery is suspected, but the truth proves far stranger: As a final challenge to his three sons, Broadbent has buried himself and his treasure somewhere in the world, hidden away like an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. If the sons wish to claim their fabulous inheritance, they must find their father's carefully concealed tomb.

The race is on, but the three brothers are not the only ones competing for the treasure. This secret is so astounding it cannot be kept quiet for long. With half a billion dollars at stake, as well as an ancient Mayan codex that may hold a cure for cancer and other deadly diseases, others soon join the hunt---and some of them will stop at nothing to claim the grave goods.

The bestselling coauthor of such page-turning thrillers as Relic and The Cabinet of Curiosities, Douglas Preston now spins an unforgettable tale of greed, adventure, and betrayal.</font>

Not quite up to par with the Preston/Child novels but good nonetheless. There were also a few loopholes as a result of the hurried ending."

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

Will Travis, an investigator who specializes in small-time jobs like looking into employee theft at hotels and bars, falls into a much bigger case when he unwittingly foils a murder attempt on a politician's daughter. Sitting in a hotel bar he sees a man drop something into a woman's drink, then watches as she begins to lose consciousness. Unable to sit by and watch her in peril, he comes to her rescue only to nearly get killed himself by a hitman out to get her.

The woman, Claire Harrington, tells a farfetched but believable story, given what they've just escaped: She's in danger because she believes her father's death--ruled a suicide by the police--was actually murder. What's more, she believes that one of the candidates in the upcoming presidential election was behind it.

Will gets drawn further and further into this dangerous situation, caught between wanting to go to the authorities, whom Claire doesn't trust, and wanting to help her himself. When events begin to spiral out of control, he knows there's no way out until they find the truth, wherever it takes them. Political Suicide is another gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller from Alan Russell, one of the most ingenious suspense writers working today.</font>

I've read and liked two of his previous novels, <i>Exposure</i> and <i>Shame</i>. I can't say the same for this novel though. First up, the plot in itself isn't that interesting and his writing wasn't as gripping as I remembered. It took me about three days on and off to finish this. Very bad!"

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

Hot on the trail of her much talked-about debut, Lip Service, M.J. Rose once again explores the dark corners of the human psyche in a riveting and erotic tale of love, lust...and betrayal. 

Although everyone thinks she's being paranoid, psychotherapist Jordan Sloan knows better. Haunted by the long-ago murder of her father, she learns that his killer has been paroled and she instantly fears his revenge. Only she knows the dark secret of her relationship with Mallory -- and the depth of her deception in providing the testimony that put him away. She sees him in shadows, in mirrors, in photographs her teenage daughter takes in the park.... 

Still suffering the bruises of her husband's betrayal, Jordan grapples with ambiguous emotions even as she is drawn again to her estranged spouse. Clinging desperately to the hard-earned stability of her life, she maneuvers through the meshwork of love's fragile bonds, layers of longing, and the chaos that is human relationships. All the while, a mysterious new patient seems intent on contributing to Jordan's unraveling. For as she struggles to prove that her fear of Mallory is justified, she also wrestles with how it might feel to finally forgive Robert's infidelity. 

M.J. Rose has crafted a rare and evocative new novel of spellbinding energy, as a woman come to terms with her own life -- assuming she will continue to enjoy the luxury of living it.</font>

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

From talented newcomer Patricia Traxler comes a brilliant literary suspense novel about how desire can become jealousy, obsession, and finally murderous rage. Blood is equal parts auspicious literary debut, pageturner, and erotic novel about four people whose lives become irrevocably intertwined during one year at Radcliffe College. 

The narrator, Norrie Blume, is a painter who has accepted a prestigious fellowship at the college; she's excited to leave her job as a commercial graphic designer and take up the artist's life. But she's also in the middle of an intense love affair with a married colleague, an affair that is threatening to consume both their lives. At Radcliffe, Norrie develops friendships with two other fellows, a journalist and a poet. One is deep, comforting; the other ruled by need and guilt. These three intense relationships quickly begin to infringe upon each other, and soon the four of them seem to be hurtling toward some shocking-and perhaps tragic-end. 

Blood is a triumph of suspense writing, a true psychological thriller about the nature of desire and the danger of love.</font>

Detective Lindsay Boxer and Assistant District Attorney Jill Bernhardt are enjoying a quiet afternoon in San Francisco when a townhouse across the street explodes in flames. A sinister note signed ""August Spies"" is found at the scene of the disaster, and the body of an infant who was asleep in the house at the time of the explosion cannot be found. Soon a wave of violent incidents, all with links to political terrorism and involving ""August Spies,"" sweeps through the city. An upcoming economic summit of the world's most powerful nations will surely be a target. And it's up to the Women's Murder Club to get to the bottom of the violence before it's too late. Delivering the breakneck pace and never-saw-it-coming plot twists that have made James Patterson the most addictive writer at work today, 3rd DEGREE is another searing and unforgettable thriller from the nation's #1 bestselling suspense writer. </font>

He's really lost it. Maybe he didn't even have it to begin with. But Patterson's books are getting annoying. The flimsy plot, the too-short chapters... Even the death of one of the members of the Women's Murder Club didn't even register that much. A one-hour read. That is, if you've got nothing better to do [I was procrastinating over an essay so I had an excuse :-P ]."

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

Temperance Brennan, forensic anthropologist for both North Carolina and Quebec, has come to Montreal during the bleak days of December to testify as an expert witness at a murder trial. 

She should be going over her notes, but instead she's digging in the basement of a pizza parlor, investigating the skeletonized remains of three young women. How did they get there? When did they die? 

Homicide detective Luc Claudel believes the bones are historic. Not his case, not his concern. The pizza parlor owner found nineteenth-century buttons near the skeletons. Claudel takes them as an indicator of the bones' antiquity. 

But something doesn't make sense. Tempe examines the bones in her lab and establishes approximate age with Carbon 14. Study of tooth enamel tells her where the women were born. If she's right, Claudel has three recent murders on his hands. Definitely his case. 

Detective Andrew Ryan, meanwhile, is acting mysteriously. What are those private phone calls he takes, and why does he suddenly disappear just when Tempe is beginning to hope he might be a permanent part of her life? 

As Tempe searches for answers, she finds herself drawn deep into a web of evil into which women have disappeared, never to return....Tempe may be next. 

With its powerful mix of nail-biting suspense and cutting-edge forensic science, Monday Mourning is the best yet from this megastar author who, as New York Newsday says, is ""the real thing.</font>

Princeton. Good Friday, 1999. On the eve of graduation, two students are a hairsbreadth from solving the mysteries of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili. Famous for its hypnotic power over those who study it, the five-hundred-year-old Hypnerotomachia may finally reveal its secrets -- to Tom Sullivan, whose father was obsessed with the book, and Paul Harris, whose future depends on it. As the deadline looms, research has stalled -- until an ancient diary surfaces. What Tom and Paul discover inside shocks even them: proof that the location of a hidden crypt has been ciphered within the pages of the obscure Renaissance text. 

Armed with this final clue, the two friends delve into the bizarre world of the Hypnerotomachia -- a world of forgotten erudition, strange sexual appetites, and terrible violence. But just as they begin to realize the magnitude of their discovery, Princeton's snowy campus is rocked: a longtime student of the book is murdered, shot dead in the hushed halls of the history department. 

A tale of timeless intrigue, dazzling scholarship, and great imaginative power, The Rule of Four is the story of a young man divided between the future's promise and the past's allure, guided only by friendship and love.</font>

Although this was a far more well written novel than The DaVinci Code, I still enjoyed the latter much more. The puzzle or the book that they were trying to solve didn't really fascinate me and I felt that there were too little of the actual code-solving compared to the personal stories that could be found throughout."

Five women who have been best friends since college are getting together for their annual vacation. This year it is Helen's choice. She is interested in the bizarre and The Totem Pole Lodge seems like the perfect choice for this year's trip. The abandoned hotel has a terrible history of lodgers having been killed by a mass murderer. The girls are having a blast until they realize that they aren't alone. After deciding to stay the night and leave in the morning, they find the keys to be missing. When morning comes, one of the girls is gone and the others set out to find her. The same thing that happened twelve years before is happening again by the hands of the same killer. The remaining four girls go through a series of events that make their college adventures pale in comparison. Through friendship and a search for justice, the girls are determined to find the person responsible for the death of their friend and when they find him, they will make him pay.

I found no hint of horror in this book. Most of the time, it was like a soap opera gone wrong. I'm still prepared to read some of his books though as some of them have won *horror* awards. Hopefully, they would be better than this."

I had high hopes for this book judging from the amount and the sheer level of good reviews all around the book cover from well-renowned fantasy authors (like Gaiman and Straub, for instance). I found the book quite disappointing, however, and I couldn't wait for it to end. I didn't like the characters (except for Chance but only during the first half of the book) and the story was confusing especially at the end. It just didn't come together for me. I liked the way she tells the story though and how she uses words. I still have another book of her coming up [Threshold] and hopefully it would be better than this since it's all about Chance this time."

From the bestselling author of Shopgirl comes the tender story of a troubled man who finds love, and life, in the most unexpected place. 

Daniel resides in his Santa Monica apartment, living much of his life as a bystander: He watches from his window as the world goes by, and his only relationships seem to be with people who barely know he exists. He passes the time idly filling out contest applications, counting ceiling tiles, and estimating the wattage of light bulbs. 

It is through Daniel's growing attachment to Clarissa, and to Teddy, that he finally gains the courage to begin to engage the world outside, and in doing so, he discovers love, and life, in the most surprising places. 

Filled with his trademark humor, tenderness, and out and out hilarious wordplay, The Pleasure of My Company is a tour de force sure to delight all of Steve Martin's fans. </font>

What if everything you believed about your life was a lie? Meet Lily Quinn. She is broke, struggling to finish college, pay her rent, find love. Adrift in bustling New York City, the most interesting things in Lily's life happen to the people around her. But Lily loves her aimless life ... until her best friend and roommate Amy disappears. That's when Spencer Patrick O'Malley, a cynical, past his prime, NYPD detective with demons of his own, enters Lily's world. And a sudden financial windfall which should bring Lily joy instead becomes an ominous portent of the dark forces gathering around her. But fate isn't finished with Lily. She finds herself fighting for her life as Spencer's search for the missing Amy intensifies, leading Lily to question everything she knew about her friend and family. Startling revelations about the people she loves force her to confront truths that will leave her changed forever. From a master storyteller comes a new heart-wrenching, magnificent and unputdownable novel. </font>

It's been a long time since I've bought a brand-new book at full price but I just could never pass this up. I've read almost all of Paullina Simon's books except for one, The Bridge to Holy Cross. Although I bought the book a little more than a year ago, I still can't bring myself to read it because I know that I'll end up in a blubbering mess. I love all of her books and her characters are so realistic that people just can't help but relate to them. The Girl in Times Square was a bit of a hefty read and there were a couple of slow parts but all in all, it was worth the money and the time. Recommended!"

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

Ablow doesn't mince words when it comes to titles (Compulsion; Projection; Denial), and the name of this entry, number four in the Frank Clevenger series, says it all. The psychopath in question, Jonah Wrens, opens the book blasting down the highway locked into anger mode. He's scattered 17 bodies behind him and is on the lookout for number 18. Ablow distinguishes this serial killer from his fictional brethren by making Wrens a brilliant psychiatrist, the savior of disturbed children. This is a subject dear to Clevenger's heart. After years of dope sniffing, womanizing and drinking, the forensic psychiatrist has adopted troubled teen Billy Bishop. He now faces life with a kid who has all the same problems and addictions he used to suffer from himself. At the same time that adopted son Billy is tossed out of school for peddling dope, Clevenger is tapped by the FBI to aid in the search for the so-called Highway Killer. Clevenger knows he should be home tending to Billy, but the lure of the hunt and the stirrings of lust engendered by bombshell FBI psychiatrist Dr. Whitney McCormick convince him to take the case. Meanwhile, Wren continues his murdering ways while moving from job to job, healing and saving abused children as he goes. The author's gambit is to put the reader into the uncomfortable position of actually admiring some of Wren's deeds, and it's an original twist on the serial killer formula. Ablow tosses in a gratuitous, last-minute female-in-peril sequence, but most of the loose ends are neatly tied.</font>

R - ***/

A fast-paced and thrilling read. Ablow's novels can be classified as belonging to the more 'intelligent' stream of fiction thriller around, especially in the psychological thriller genre."

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

<i>Plymouth 1967: Schoolgirl Nell Adams, all the newspapers reported, finds murder victim on train. And there was her picture on the front page. So he knew her name and he knew her face. his face, or lack of it, filled her nightmares until she woke screaming...</i>

London 1971: Nell Adams is now a university student in london, trying to put the past behind her. But as a series of murders obsessed with Jack the Ripper, Nell realises her nightmares might be coming true. 

Detective Briony Williams, also just starting out on her life in london, is attached to the team tracking down The Walker. The killer is a practised anatomist with a theatrical streak. Arranging his victims' bodies in twisted parodies of Hogarth's engravings, in particular the <i>Reward of Cruelty</i>, he sends a perfectly extracted eye to the police in a Tupperware container, with a defiant message. He's planning a reunion with the schoolgirl who found his first victim...</font>

R - **

This novel quite reminded me of most Australian police tv shows. Slow, bland and totally uninteresting. I was rushing it by the end so that I would get the satisfaction of actually finishing it. However, I still gave it two stars because I liked the character of Briony Williams.

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

<b>In a secluded cabin in rural Massachusetts, six young men stage a deadly standoff with FBI and ATF agents. When dust from the flying bullets finally settles, three agents are wounded, one fatally, and five suspects are dead. 

In a wooded area near the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C., the body of a senator's daughter is discovered. Dead by strangulation, the young woman is left artfully posed, her clothes folded neatly beside her.</b>

For FBI Special Agent Maggie O'Dell, there is nothing routine about being called in to work these two cases. As an expert criminal profiler, Maggie provides psychological insight on cases that involve suspected serial killers. She can't understand, then, why her boss, Assistant Director Cunningham, has assigned her to these two seemingly unrelated crimes. 

But as Maggie and her partner, Special Agent R.J. Tully, delve deeper into the two cases, they learn that there is a connection between the crimes: Reverend Joseph Everett. The charismatic leader of a high-profile religious sect, Everett has cultivated a devoted following that is growing in numbers daily. The young men holed up in the cabin were members of Everett's church, and the murder of the young woman took place following a religious rally Everett held in the capital. 

The key to unraveling the significance of these two crimes is Everett himself. But he is untouchable, living on a heavily guarded compound the police are unable to penetrate. Maggie realizes, however, that she may have found a way to get to Everett: by using her own mother, a member of his church. 

Is Everett a psychotic madman who uses his position of power to perform heinous crimes? Or is he merely a scapegoat for a killer more cunning, more disciplined than he? Maggie realizes too late that there is more going on here than the FBI ever imagined . . . and her own mother may be about to pay the price.</font>

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

Margrave is a no-account little town in the Georgia Sunbelt. The busiest it ever gets is at the end of the schoolday. But there's something strange about Margrave: it's completely perfect. So perfect, it's frightening. The lawns are like velvet and the trees lok like they've just had a manicure. And from the laid-back barbershop to Eno's state-of-the-art diner, the local businesses thrive without customers. 

When drifter and ex-military policeman Jack Reacher hits town, he plans to be gone by Monday. But before then Margrave has its first homicide in thirty years. As the only stranger in town the murder is pinned on Reacher. And so begins his nightmare... starting with a weekend on the killing floor among the jailhouse lifers. 

If long-lost kin and a long-dead guitar hero could tell tales, Reacher would know just what kind of big operation he's walked into. But as the nasty secrets of the lethal conspiracy that keeps the whole town ticking start to leak out, the body count mounts. And the killing turns into an epidemic.</font>

I've read all of Lee's Reacher novels save for the newest one [The Enemy] and this book is my least favorite out of the bunch. It took me about two weeks to finish it as I keep on putting it down. The suspense didn't really start until the last few chapters. Still it wouldn't put me off from reading more of the Reacher series."

Three months later, another body is found, killed in the same style as Jeffreys' victims. 

Is there a copycat killer on the loose? Or is this the real thing?</b>

Sheriff Nick Morrelli isn't equipped to deal with this case that is terrorizing the small, close-knit community of Platte City, Nebraska. Knowing he needs help, he calls in one of the FBI's best criminal profilers, Maggie O' Dell. And with the help of a small-town sheriff who is clearly out of his depths, Maggie starts to put together the gruesome picture of a killer. The picture of someone who has already been executed for his crimes. 

When another victim is found a third kidnapped, Nick and Maggie realize they're running out of time. And the terrible truth begins to become clear. Was Jeffreys convicted of crimes he didn't commit? Or has a cold-blooded killer been given to the chance to perfect his crime?</font>

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

""The first and only thing you need to know about Gideon is that you'll get no answers whatsoever about him. None. You will never meet him, you will never speak to him, you will never have any contact with him. . . . Gideon is in an extremely sensitive position.""
Framed for two murders he didn't commit, Granville is a man on the run. He knows too much--but not enough to save himself. Pursued by the FBI, hunted by an assassin who kills with lethal precision, and desperate to escape the hell that is threatening to destroy him, Granville turns to the one person he can trust: his ex-girlfriend, journalist Amanda Mays. With her investigative skills and Granville's instincts for survival, they strive to uncoil the tightly wound truth. But they are embroiled in something far greater than either could ever have imagined--a dark conspiracy that will forever change the course of history.

Granville's only hope: penetrate the enigma of the name that began his nightmare--unearth the real identity of . . .

GIDEON

Relentlessly paced, Gideon is an exciting, chillingly original thriller packed with startling double crosses, tense pursuits, whiplash twists of plot, and shocking revelations about the nature of power and those who really possess it. It is a masterpiece of suspense.

Gideon. An identity shrouded in mystery--the anonymous source who holds the key to an explosive secret. In a clandestine meeting, writer Carl Granville is hired to take the pages of an old diary, articles, letters--documents in which all proper names and locations have been blacked out--and turn them into compelling fiction. He will be paid a quarter of a million dollars. But he can never tell a soul.

As he is fed information and his work progresses, Granville begins to realize that Gideon's book is more than just a potential bestseller. It is a revelation of chilling evil and a decades-long cover-up by someone with far-reaching power. He starts to have second thoughts. How will his book be used? Whose lives will be shattered? What is the truth behind the story--and who is the true storyteller?

Then someone close to Granville is bludgeoned to death. Another is savagely murdered. His apartment is ransacked, his computer destroyed, all his records stolen. Suspicion falls on Granville. He tries to explain the shadowy assignment. No one believes him. He has no proof, no alibis. </font>

When Dr. Rennie Newton is summoned to jury duty, she brings to the courtroom the same level of competence that she displays in the operating room. Her commitment to precision compels her to deliver a not guilty verdict in the murder case against notorious contract killer Ricky Lozada. 

It will be the most regrettable decision in her life...because Rennie's trial with Lozada doesn't end with his acquittal. 

Her carefully structured life begins to crumble when a rival colleague is brutally slain. Lozada's menacing shadow looms over the murder, but it's Rennie the investigators focus on as a prime suspect. The privacy she has cultivated and protected at all costs is violated by the police as well as Lozada. And when he begins an earnest courtship, it becomes terrifyingly clear that he is obsessed with having her. 

Wick Threadgill is a detective on indefinite leave from the Fort Worth PD, who has his own, personal agenda for the contract killer. Temperamental, bitter, and driven by loyalty and love, Wick is determined to destroy Lozada. 

In order to defeat Lozada -- and save their lives -- Rennie and Wick form an uneasy alliance. Mistrustful of each other, they know only one thing with absolute certainty, when this killer strikes, they won't see it coming. 

The Crush will take you on a tortuous path through a twisted sociopath's eerie obsession, a haunted man fragile hopes for redemption, and a woman's heart as she struggles to face the greatest fear -- to open herself to love. --This text refers to the Audio Cassette edition. </font>

In a memoir hailed for its searing candour and wit, Alice Sebold reveals how her life was utterly transformed when, as an eighteen-year-old college freshman, she was brutally raped and beaten in a park near campus. 

What propels the chronicle of her recovery is Sebold's indomitable spirit - as she struggles for understanding ('After telling the hard facts to anyone, from lover to friend, I have changed in their eyes'); as her dazed family and friends sometimes bungle their efforts to provide comfort and support; and as, ultimately, she triumphs, managing through grit and coincidence to help secure her attacker's arrest and conviction. 

In a narrative by turns disturbing, thrilling and inspiring, Alice Sebold illuminates the experience of trauma victims even as she imparts wisdon profoundly hard-won: 'You save yourself or you remain unsaved.'</font>

"event","Have you ever picked up a book, read a few chapters [or pages] and decided that it's really not worth your time to finish it? 

I've had a few duds lately. I used to be really patient and I try to finish every book that I've started but since reading and finishing White Teeth by Zadie Smith which was just a painful experience, I've decided to change my reading habits. If the book doesn't grab me, say, in the first few chapters then I just chuck it and start on another book. Too many good books and so little time. I study full-time and work part-time so reading for me [outside of academic reading] is purely for pleasure so I don't like wasting my time on unstimulating and banal books. 

Here's what I've started and have put on hold [maybe just for the moment, possibly forever]:

<i>*The Romantics by Pankaj Mishra</i> - flat writing, no tone. I'd rather read my law textbook [library book]. 
<i>*To the Nines by Janet Evanovich</i> - if you've read one or two Stephanie Plum novels, you've basically read everything. Just add a few kooky characters and change the title to the next number [library book]. 
<i>*Cloud of Sparrows by Takashi Matsuoka</i> - I bought this book in a sale so I will finish it indefinitely. 

That's all I can remember for now although I'm pretty sure I've had quite a lot more duds this year. What are your reading habits? Any duds to share?

This is the kind of book that mostly everyone will like, books about viruses, genetic engineering and the possibility of wiping out the entire human race. The first part of the book concentrated mainly on the description of the virus and the Mount Dragon facility while the second half was all about the suspense. Frankly, I found the first half to be more engaging and interesting probably because I took a short course on Microbiology and am still fascinated with viruses and the like [esp. how most people underestimate influenza]. The second part dragged on and on although the ending mostly made up for it. All in all, still a good read but definitely not their best.

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

Somewhere in Northern Africa, a woman traveler awakens witha mysterious mark on her hand, a mark that soon grows in a tattoo. So begins the enigma of <i>The Tattooed Map</i>, in which intrepid traveler Lydia journeys with her friend and former lover, Christopher, to Morocco in search of antiques and adventure. 

Lydia records her daily experiences in a journal, keeping track of hotel addresses and conversations, and pasting such flotsam and jetsam such as maps, photographs, and drawings into her diary. She records her shock and dismay as the marks on her hand reveal themselves to be a detailed map of an unknow territory. Later, a cryptic Moroccan man explains the map's connection to a spiritual and physical journey she must make. When Lydia disappears unexpectedly, Chris takes up her diary to record his search for her - and for a way to unravel the riddle of the Tattooed Map. 

In her rich and captivating first novel, author Barbara Hodgson guides us through the exotic world of Morocco, with its maze-like streets, musty shops, and unexpected secrets. Mysterious, enveloping, and thoroughly evocative, The Tattoed Map will make you want to embark upon a journey - if only you could be sure of your return.

A short and beautiful book filled with lovely illustrations. I used to do what Lydia does in a book - collecting and pasting little pieces of paper and photos and other ephemera in a notebook. This book makes me want to start that hobby all over again."

by Gregory Dart
April 2003</a>

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

""She won't stop writing to me - e-mails, letters, text messages, cards. But it's not merely because I hardly know her that I no longer reply. Sometimes her complaints seem so plausible that I wonder if I am not the one to blame. At others, it is the pure flame of her hatred that mesmerizes me - and it is then that I begin to feel afraid."" 

<b>Unrequited Love</b> is the story of a London University lecturer's unwilling encounter with the spectre of obsession. Not until he himself fell victim to the charms of a virtual stranger did he begin to understand the psyche of his own hopelessly impassioned admirer. Dating, as Gregory Dart finds, has become a dangerous game. Whatever happened to the good old rules of courtship? Are we all potential stalkers now? </font>

The story of the alleged 'stalking' itself was interesting but it goes downhill from there and we're still nowhere half of the book."

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

Born to rough cloth in working-class London in 1748, Mary Saunders hungers for linen and lace. Her lust for a shiny red ribbon leads her to a life of prostitution at a young age, where she encounters a freedom unknown to virtuous young women. But a dangerous misstep sends her fleeing to Monmouth and the refuge of the middle-class household of Mrs. Jones, to become the seamstress her mother always expected her to be and to live the ordinary life of an ordinary girl. Although Mary becomes a close confidante of Mrs. Jones, her desire for a better life leads her back to prostitution. She remains true only to the three rules she learned on the streets of London: Never give up your liberty; Clothes make the woman; Clothes are the greatest lie ever told. In the end, it is clothes, their splendor and their deception, that lead Mary to disaster.

Emma Donoghue's daring, sensually charged prose casts a new sheen on the squalor and glamour of eighteenth-century England. Accurate, masterfully written, and infused with themes that still bedevil us today, Slammerkin is historical fiction for all readers.</font>

<font size=-2><i>Book Description</i>

Samantha Falconer has always been pretty good at taking care of herself. Four times world judo champion, she now runs the Gentle way investigation agency in London. But when her brother Mark asks her to return to Oxford to investigate the disappearance of a young woman, Sam finds herself confronting a past she hoped she'd left behind. Oxford is full of ghosts and Sam is still reeling from a recent case where she found the body of a murdered four-year-old girl. To this day, she has no idea what led her to the scene and the closer she gets to the city, the more uneasy she becomes. Then, out of the blue, Sam receives a letter from a man who's been dead for twenty-eight years - her father...

As Sam begins to investigate the woman's disappearance, she finds every trail leads back to the university. But the closed academic world is unwilling to give up its secrets. Soon it becomes clear that someone is determined to put an end to Sam's search for the truth, at all costs. Intricately woven and ingeniously plotted, Victoria Blake's debut novel introduces Sam Falconer, a PI whoe private life is every bit as fascinating as her cases. </font>

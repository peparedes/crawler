"event","Got an SOS from an old friend today, so went and entertained her for a while and then went out into the clubs last nite to amuse her and enjoy the 'nightlife' (I use that description somewhat liberally -- I don't know that having 2 brain cells quite meets the necssary prerequisites for 'life') .

hhmmmm should say more .. but that will have to wait until morning;"

"event","Miles away
There's hopeless smile brighter than mine
And I need for you to come and go
Without the truth falling out

Old incisions refusing to stay
Like sun through the trees on a cloudy day

You brighten my life like a polystyrene hat
But it melts in the sun like a life without love
And I've waited for you so I'll keep holding on 
Without you(x2)

Telephone
Socially scared and impaired
If the trees will bloom the wind can blow
Without the fruit falling out

Old incisions refusing to stay
Like sun through the trees on a cloudy day

You brighten my life like a polystyrene hat
But it melts in the sun like a life without love
And I've waited for you so I'll keep holding on 
Without you(x2)

Feels like the wind blows 
Holding you with us
She takes no other
False light and ashes
Blooming like winter

You brighten my life like a polystyrene hat
But it melts in the sun like a life without love
And I've waited for you so I'll keep holding on 
Without you(x3)"

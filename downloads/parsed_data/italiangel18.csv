"event","time for a big update since i havent updated this thing in forever. i dont know how many people still read this thing, but whatever, hi to whoever does!! soo much has been going on in my life right now. i quit that horrible HALECorp job, selling vitamins. it was cool for a while, made some good initial sales money, then ran out of people to sell too and got annoyed with my boss. so yea lol, that was the end of that. spent the rest of the summer working for my dads partner who i think is awesome and much fun to work for. i had pretty extensive foot surgery 2 weeks ago. my toes are so freakin deformed, they got to the point where everytime i put shoes on the shoes cut into my last two toes. so my dad cut them open, cut out pieces of the bones, and then rotated my toes. it was pretty cool. 16 stitches total, and i have to say being put under was one of the coolest things i have ever experienced. so now i can walk, stitches are out, buuut shoes are still out of the question because im still bruised and it hurts too much to put them on, but i will eventually. i went back to school on the 19th of august for freshman orientation. i love being a PACER, its incredible. i absolutely love working with others and i know without a doubt that i want to be a therapist. school is a lot of work this semester. more psychology classes which i love, but i have to take my math class which i absolutely cant stand bc i hate math with a passion. my parents are officially getting divorced, the papers were finally filed and in process of going through. my mom, brother, sister and i are moving. we're selling our beautiful house which i am absolutely in love with. house goes on the market officially sept 29th. the realtor said it probably will be sold by thanksgiving. its going to be feautured in next months edition of philadelphia as a premier home in the ""new main line"" chester springs! my mom is planning on moving to delaware, i have no idea where my dad will go. frankly im not sure if i care. he comes around when he wants, when its convenient, i actually dont know where he is living now so it wont be that different once we move in that regard. dans mom has offered to let me live with them until dan and i can get our own place. im thinking about it, i dont know delaware at all, and dan lives in chester springs so i'd still be in the town that i love if i live with them. i dont know yet. im going to california in novemeber with PACE. im scared to death of flying, ive recently ben having nightmares about flying and they arent helping. im excited to go to cali but we leave the day the school has planned a trip to see rent. im not too thrilled about missing it. ive only seen it 4 times :) right now im appliying for a position as an adolescent counselor at a crisis center by my school. a friend of mine works there and she loves it and it sounds perfect for me. hopefully i'll get the position, working on PACE and with shelli will certainly help my chances. on wednesday buddhist monks are coming to lead a meditation and discussion and i am soo excited for it. its going to be incredible. my school hosts some of the coolest and unique activities of any college campus. i have a feeling this school year is going to be a great one. ohhhhh and im taking an irish music class. we actually learn how to play the tin whistle!! its very cool, but its a little hard bc i have to learn to read music and all the different components of music, and its tough. but i can play on top of old smokey (the meatball song) and also old mcdonald!! and i really enjoyed gen's post about the facebook group. brought back some fun/annoying villa memories. i actually miss that place sometimes. i miss some of the people from villa too. there were a few people who i thought i'd be closer to after high school ended and ended up i wasnt. but its ok. i hope we have a high school reunion soon, it would be awesome to see everyone again. so, i have just realized that this entire post has been a bit incoherant and rambling on, so im going to end here and say goodnight. hope everyone who reads this is well and enjoying life!!"

"event","i love RENT. like seriously. RENT is like my salvation or something. it just makes everything bad go away for a little while, and its healthy (oh god). ive loved it for so long, wayy before the movie, its just so nice to b able to experience it whenever i want to now. my mom called me this afternoon and told me that my little sister had a religion assignment where she had to choose a song that reminded her of god, and right away she said she wanted to do it on seasons of love. my 8 year old sister!! i am so proud. shes begging me to see the movie... what do u'all think about that? my mom says shes too young (my mom hasnt seen it yet either) i think theres nothing wrong with her seeing the movie, i think she should wait a couple years tho with the show itself. 


look i find some of what you teach suspect
because im used to relying on intellect
but i try to open up to what i dont know 
because reason says i should have died

"event","havent updated for a loooong time so i suppose i will do it now. 

im really enjoying this semester so far, my schedule is as follows: 

MWF- Intro to Drama 2pm-2:50
T-TH Psychobiology 9:30-10:45
     Applied Research Design and Analysis 11-12:15 
     Western Civ from 1600 12:30-1:45
     Counseling Psychology 2- 3:15

So its a fairly busy semester, but the classes are interesting so its ok. 

Things at home arent going so well. My dad still is living in his apartment and my mom brother and sister are living in our house. my sister still really doesnt know whats going on. during the week when my dad isnt there she doesnt even realize it, and if he comes for dinner 1 day in the week for 2 hrs, she kinda like walks in the room, says hi dad, and leaves. and louis is really torn up, primarily because i think hes trying to sort through the messages he is being given. my dad is telling eveyrone he talks to that my mom is sick and that she drove him out of the house. and everyone in our family is disputing my dad on it, but he refuses to recognize how much of a part he has played in all of it. as everyone in the family knows about the girl hes always with, he is trying to protect her and his relationship with her. christmas was so weird, he came xmas eve for dinner, but left earlier. then came xmas morning and was sleeping on the couch the whole time. he couldnt have made it any more obvious that he didnt want to b there. i was so mad at him over christmas. this isnt just about him, its about the entire family, but he acts as though its just about him and that everything is happening to only him. i thought he acted extremely selfishly over christmas, he should have sucked it up for 2 days. and then he wasnt around for new years. ive never spent a new years without my entire family. he didnt even call me. i was home for a full month and the only time he called me was to yell at me for ""talking about his life"". the only time i spent alone with my dad was an hour dinner at pizzeria unos where i tried (to no avail) to tell him that its not just about his life, its my life too, and the rest of my family and how his actions are affecting everyone. if he doesnt want people talking about him then he shouldnt engage in behaviors that are going to cause people to talk about him (like being seen out with her, or canceling office hours to go out with her). hes just being so incredibly hypocritical and selfish and he tries to put it across as though this is all in the name of self care. if this was self care he'd be in therapy and working with my mother. not hiding in some apartment and taking her out all the time and escaping from all of his responsibilities. its just so frustrating and it hurts, and what hurts the most is his lack of effort. his lack of effort is just a clear message of how unimportant we are to him right now. hes acting so weird too. he changed his whole wardrobe, dressing in really younger looking pretty clothes. hes on this major crash diet, and hes lost like 50 lbs. its like hes trying to live this other life that he thinks hes missed out on. its just crazy. so anyway.. my mom is holding up very well. im seeing a side of her i never knew even existed. shes stronger, shes able to tell him to shut the fuck up when he deserves to hear it, and shes also talking to me more. ive never had a close relationship with my mom, and i probably wont ever have the type of relationship where i tell  my mom everything, but our relationship right now is one that i am comfortable with. 

eveyrthing with dan and i is good. we spend so much time together, and im the happiest when i am with him. he makes me so happy and he forces me to challenge my thoughts and behaviors the way noone else ever could. theres no one else in the world like him and i could never imagine my life without him, he is my everything, and he always will be. 

so yea i think thats about it."

"event","ok, i thought i would do a real RENT review pro's and con's (yea there were some, even i'll admit it)

PRO'S 

1. its RENT- nough said 
2. maureen makes me want to b a lesbian whoa
3. vocals were POWERFUL 
4. acting was incredible 
5. adam pascal is hot 
6. loved the ballroom scene, really got to know maureen in that song 
7. protest was hysterical, loved the monitors 
8. angel was adorable
9. columbus did an excellent job of portraying east village, wow.. and that building, whoa. 
10. its RENT 

CONS 

1. although i like the ball room scene, i still like how u dont see maureen till the protest in the show, shes like a mystery or something. 
2. mimi comes back way too fast and with way too much energy at the end, the show draws it out a little longer 
3. needed more character development on some characters... its like they focused on some (roger, mimi, maureen, joanne) and didnt delve into others (mark?????)
4. the movie soundtrack had songs that were not in the movie!! where was the fight between mark and roger?? i love that song.. goodbye love????
5. in the show when angel dies, theres so much more emotion bc they go back to the sequence where they are on the stage with the spotlights singing seasons of love, and angels spot is empty.. not enough emotional development there. 
6. take me or leave me scene was awesome, but engagement party?? nooooooo 
7. angel was moving so fast in today 4 u that it was obvious he was lip syncing that one :(
8. loved one song glory, didnt like seeing april.. they dont tell you how she died (roger character development)
9. how did i get here? how the hell.. christmas, christmas eve last year... -- where was this song?? its essential to understanding mark!!
10. thats it on the cons- 

all in all, RENT was just incredible. it was so powerful despite some of the things it lacked from the show. needless to say, i recommend to allll.. hehe"

"event","i think i should do an update rather than my stupid couple liner updates... so here goes.. 

things at school have been pretty damn awesome. i have some of the best friends i could ever have asked for. they are just so different in their own ways, and they are all so much fun and generally just good positive people to be around. i was really lucky. classes are going well too.. believe it or not, i have an A in stats?!?! yea im pretty dumbfounded on that one- math isnt my strong point. only having trouble in one class and the prof just happens to b my advisor who thinks im an idiot bc i have a C in his class, but doesnt understand how I have A's in everything else. who is the stupid one again?? things with dan and i are just as wonderful as they always were. poor boy is always so busy bc his teachers are evil and think its fun to load him with a ton of work all due at the same time. i am planning their demise :) things at home arent too good. dad got an apartment where his bitch whore lives. eww. so things like thanksgiving and xmas are going to be interesting, dont know if hes going to be there or not for those things. im not talking to him unless i have to. i just need to keep up some boundaries to protect myself. hes incapable of change, at least as of right now. the only thing i can do is support my mom, brother and sister. its so sad though, bc my dad is doing everything he can to manipulate people into thinking hes the victim when he absolutely is not. but my mom is doing much better than i ever thought she'd be given the circumstances. it's tough though when i think about what a divorce means, even though i sincerely believe a divorce would b for the best. but i mean moving, custody battles, seperate b-day cards and different houses for xmas. just going to be weird. the only thing i am not going to deal with is if he leaves my mom and goes with her. im 20 years old, i dont need to put up with that. the only thing i really need from him is a check for school and i really mean that. it took me a long time to realize that i dont need his acceptance to be ok with myself, he doesnt define who i am. my relationship with him from here on out is pretty much up to him. i know where i stand, and i have pretty good boundaries up around this whole thing. anyway... in much better happier news, RENT is coming out in 10 days!!!! i absolutely cant wait! i am so freakin excited. you know whats insane?? i listen to the soundtrack or watch the movie trailers and i am so excited that i actually start crying! how weird is that. talk about having passionate feelings for something! :) im going to b seeing this movie alot i know it. anyone who wants to see it and cant find anyone to go with- im here! i swear there wont b a number on the number of times i see it. i bought a RENT t-shit and hat for the opening which im wearing! so excited. i really like rosario dawson the girl who is playing mimi. she has an absolutely amazing voice. and even the girl who is playing joanne, tracie thoms is impressive. i think its incredible that like 10 years later the original cast is as perfect (if not even better) as they were when they first started. even jesse martin is incredible and looks so much younger in RENT than he does in law and order! idina is always perfect no matter what she does so no suprise there. adam pascal is just beautiful- not loving his hair in the movie- but hes still beautiful. the movie includes april, roger's ex who dies.. shes in like flashbacks during one song glory (my favorite song). which i think might b a little weird bc glory is rogers very passionate solo and i think they should have left it like that. in the show you really connect with roger i think, really during that song. and i love the last song that included for the credits at the end- love heals. its really nice. they left out a couple of songs and a couple key lines that i loved from the show- but its still going to b amazing. ok enough rambling, im done. oh yea, my phone took a swim and i dont have anyones phone numbers.. could you all comment with ur numbers so i can put them in this new phone im using. thanks!!"

parents are getting divorced. 

dad is an asshole and refuses to accept that he may have some responsibility in causing the problems. 

dad thinks its ok to just leave and not telling anyone where he is going and ignore everyone. 

dad is sooo good at playing the victim when he's NOT. 

mom is being blamed for everything. 

everyone is mad at each other. 

divorce and custody battles to come- great."

but it wasnt my fault.. i got ""bumped in the rear"" haha 

was at an interestion and car 2 in front of me was turning left, so i stopped and the person in back of me, well, didnt. 

im fine, and my car is ok for the most part

i love my fucking spare tire.. that thing has saved me so many times. they hit my spare, and their car literally went under my car... my spare crunched their hood up along with it. 

so their car is totalled.. my car is good except for some scratches on the bumper, my license plate is bashed up and the casing for my gas tank is cracked, but the gas tank is ok. im still going to have it looked at just in case there is something wrong that i cant see. 

so yea.. fun stuff.. my neck is really sore, but i guess that goes along with it. took forever to get ahold of someone.. had to call my aunt to get ahold of my parents.. but w/e i handled it pretty well thankfully. 

ok i probably should update with more important stuff, but eh theres no fun in that.. so that'll come later."

You are dignified, spiritual, and wise.
Always unsatisfied, you constantly try to better yourself.
You are also a seeker of knowledge and often buried in books.

You tend to be philosophical, looking for the big picture in life.
You dream of inner peace for yourself, your friends, and the world.
A good friend, you always give of yourself first.</font></td></tr></table>

"event","i hate being in the hospital.. i really dont think there is anything worse. well being in the hospital and the doctors not knowing what is wrong with you could perhaps be the absolute worse. god i hate the hospital. wednesday morning i woke up and had a really baaaad pain in my right side, and it just got progressively worse as the day went on. the best way i can describe it is that it felt like a really bad side stitch stabbing at me. so 11pm dan drives me to the ER at lehigh valley, and we wait 4 HOURS!!! to see a doctor. there was like 3 other people ahead of me, and then 5 people came in behind me, and i was the last to go in! and i was like doubled over in pain. so i finally get back to see the doctor and the pain is so bad they put a morphine IV in me! if you've never had morphine, consider yourself lucky. i seriously thought i was going to die. i absolutely couldnt breathe. the after effects of morphine are pretty nice though.. for one thing, no more intense pain, more a subdue pain, and u get a little 'high' feeling. not too bad. anyway, they do a ton of tests, stick me with 2 more IV's and take blood 4 times, and they cant tell me whats wrong. figures. so i call my dad and beg him to pick me up and take me to brandywine where i know the doctors and nurses (i worked there). so he comes and pickes me up, nicest thing hes done for me in a long time, i was really appreciative. and then i get admitted into brandywine hospital where they hook me up with more IV's and take my blood 5 more times.. and my blood pressure 100 more times! ahhh i hate the hospital. so they do another ct scan saturday morning, and they said the appendix looked inflammed or something. but by that point the thought of getting stuck by one more needle made me feel homicidal, so i told them that the pain had really decreased (total lie) and that i was feeling a lot better (total lie) i think they knew it too bc they kept doing clinical examinations, pushing and proding etc, and i was doing all i could not to flinch or scream. i just wanted out of there so badly. so here i am, out of the hospital thankfully. but still in pain. but taking lots of advil. i told dan that i will not go back to the hospital unless i am A) DYING, B) PREGNANT C) AT GUNPOINT. god it was so bad. blah. 

so dans roomate decided to inhabit his room for the first time in 2 weeks, and thus i am sleeping in my room for the first time in a long time. 

i have a lot of makeup work to do.. i dont know how im going to get it all done. 


haha i think elena loves me: 

Auto response from lenabena5: Italiangel18 (12:22:09 AM): well everyone in the whole entire world wants to be like me, which therefore means that everyone thinks like me.. thus the dean of students will think like me and she will automatically know what an amazing person you are, and what amazing great things will be coming from you just given the chance... i promise you things will go just fine. 

Italiangel18 (12:22:40 AM): and if it doesnt.. well im just going to have to kill her. 

i fucking miss my elizabeth SO much, no one understands!!



hahaha i love and miss you too dear!!"

"event","yes they do... very much. 

so dan, madeleine and i come home thursday afternoon, and the guys who were replacing our windows were on their way out the door, with all their tools in the garage bc they were coming back on friday. so they leave, we go inside, madeleine in her room, me and dan in my room. about 20 min later i hear what sounds like gun shots or fire crackers.. and then i smell it. alot of it. so dan and i start running around the house to see whats going on. we go down in the basement, check all the utility closets, and the kitchen, and the dryer etc. and im like ""dan, i think its coming from the garage, the smell is so strong in front of the garage door"". so i feel the garage door handle to see if its hot, and its not (i forgot we have a fireproof garage door) so i open the door a little bit and clouds and clouds of black smoke start pouring in the house, and the garage is full of thick black smoke, and lots and lots of flames. so i slam the door shut, yell to dan to get madeleine and the dog, and i run in the kitchen and call 911. 5 min later we're at my neighbors house and the first police officer comes to the house. couple minutes later, 7 fire trucks from 3 different counties, and 3 paramedics, and so lots of police officers. it was crazy. so they break through the new garage windows and start watering away. firefighters everywhere, running through the house, messing up all the oriental rugs!! so finally they are able to get in the garage, and its just thick black black black smoke! so the fire marshall gets there.. examines the whole scene, and comes and talks to me. finally he is able to determine the cause: the window guys had left one of their machines in the garage, and it had a special kind of battery in it. apparently, the battery inside the machine overheated, and went from 200 degrees, to 700 degrees. and the machines blew up, causing the whole garage to go up in flames. afterwards, the fire marshall said that if we hadent been home, we probably would have lots the house. oh and my dirt bike BLEW UP! its in pieces! the inside of the house is a mess! black and soot everywhere, on the walls, in the carpets, everywhere! so they are goign to have to gut the entire garage and then replace the carpet in my room and my brothers room. the fire started in in the bay right under my room, so my room smells worse than any of the other rooms in the house. also the wallpaper in the hall and staircase is going to have to be replaced too. it is just such a crazy mess. so now we are staying in a hotel while a bazillion and one people clean out our entire house. but the good news is that everyone is ok. ah, not an experience i want to go through again."

"event","i think this is so funny.. if any of you read my away message last night it went something like this: 

dear very annoying tap dancing in the room above me,
you are really agrrevating my OCD and i think you need to stop. thanks for understanding. -Liz. 

the girl who was tap dancing is a dancer, and i have never met her, hence i dont have her on my buddy list, nor am i on hers. well kel has her on her buddy list, even though kel thinks shes a bitch. well kel thinks my away message is funny, and puts it as her away message. i go to dans for a bit, and when i get back theres a message from the girl above me that says: how old are we that we have to put up away messages about the room above us, instead of coming upstairs and asking me to stop... blah blah blah. so i IM her back and im like: how old are you that you have to take everything so literally? again, i have absolutely NO idea who this girl is. NO CLUE, NEVER SEEN HER. so she starts bitching me out about it, and im like ok, chill, it wasnt meant to offend, you werent even meant to see it, it wasnt even about you! i was the subject of the away message, not you! everyone knows that any kind of tapping noise drives the hell out of me, dan does that all the time just to annoy me. it was a joke, and people on my buddy list laughed at it, bc they know how much it drives me crazy. and this girl just keeps flipping out telling me what a fucking bitch i am for making such a big deal over her tap dancing, and i have no balls bc i didnt come up and tell her to stop. well 3 people called her and asked her to stop bc they were studying, and she said ""deal"" and hung up the phone. and my suitemates had a bunch of guys in her room, and they all were like make that bitch stop tap dancing.. and she tries and tells me that im the only one who had a problem with her dancing. ah such unnecessary drama. 

so evan IM's me, and says that the message was really funny. i said thanks, but now im getting bitched out by the girl. and he goes: so? who the hell tap dances in their room? it aint footloose up there! 

haha, so that was my night away message. 

so the girl's friend comes up to kel and goes ""erin told off your roomate last night"" and kel goes ""no i believe that liz told erin off, and tell erin that next time she wants to start something with liz, she's going to have to deal with the two of us"" 

it was just amusing, bc its so ridiculous. 

anyway, just wanted to share that. goodbye."

"event","wow, so NYC was awesome. and of course RENT was spectacular. even more spectacular than the summer performance. this one just had so much more energy and so much more alive. it was absolutely wonderful. and even dan liked it, which i am thrilled about. now i can play my soundtrack with him around and not have to listen to him complain about it!! 

was very sick last week.. strept throat, cold and all.. my usual i guess. sounded like a man for a while. 

ummm and theres not really anything much going on. im really enjoying school this semester. i love being here with dan. my roomate still kinda annoys me, but we can have fun sometimes too. i dont know what im doing next semester in terms of rooming etc. my social psych teacher told me i was too advanced in my psychological knowledge for his class, and that i should be taking higher level classes. i just laughed at that. i cant wait for the counseling classes, im really looking forward to that. god i love my major, i truly truly do. 

had dinner with my grandfather, annamarie (his wife), father peter and all the other priests in the priest house tonight. they had lots of pinapple, which made me happy, except dan kept tricking me and saying to look at something, and then he'd take my pinapple, which didnt make me very happy. i hate gorgonzola cheese. its rather disgusting. they had chicken with gorgonzola cheese on it. yuck. but their salad was excellent. 

signed up for unlimited tanning at hollywood tans for 20 bux a month. i am very very very burned. dan says im probably goign to die of skin cancer, and then he puts his sad face on. but i seriously hate being pale, i mean there are some people who can be pale and still look gorgeous, like nicole kidman for example, i'd kill to look like her, but i dont, alas i go tanning. i suppose red is better than white. or at least that is the excuse im trying to make myself believe. sigh, im never going to learn huh. 

have death investigations at 9:30 so i think i will go to sleep now. this was a very interesting, somewhat coherant update on my not so interesting life. but oh well. ever been in the mood to just type, for no reason at all? yea, thats the only reason i decided to post anything. i just wanted to type i guess. oh yea and check out the 2 pics i added to my icon thingy.. theres one of me holding my RENT playbill, and one of dan holding his RENT playbill. 

oh and watched the show extreme home makeovers last night, and the boy really liked new york and they gave him a new york theme room. it was amazing. one wall was just one big picture of new york with lights in it and everything. i am soooo super jealous. i want a room like that. that house was pretty amazing in and of itself though. 

anyway, goodnight."

"event","ok im not the most observant person with the sharpest memory obviously.... 

so the school is having a trip to new york city on the 19th of february. being as observant as i am, i thought it said the 13th. so i call my mom and ask her if i can buy a ticket to see RENT with dan. she said she'd have to talk to my dad about it bc they payed for me to see it already, and she wasnt sure if it was right for them to have to pay for something they already treated me to. which is fair, so i didnt fight with her about it. so this morning im on my way to class and look at the NYC trip poster again and realize hey! its the 19th not the 13th! stupid me. so after class i go bck to my room and check my email, and my mom had sent me a nice email saying that i could buy the ticket and that it would be my valentines day present. however, they want to go to the shore the weekend of the 18th! ahh, such is my luck. so i email her back and say thank you for the ticket, i'll post pone it until the next trip bc i knew they havent gone to the shore for a while, and i knew she wanted to go. also, based upon my conversation with dan about going to NYC which concluded in him saying ""i'll go only because you want me to go"".. i figured well he wont be tooo heartbroken. man was i wrong. he was all, i didnt want you to know that i wanted to go, but i really do want to go to see RENT. so im like oh shit. so i call my mom and im like, is there anyway we can compromise this? so we agree that i can leave sunday morning (bc at this point i think the trip is on a sunday) and louis will stay with madeleine until my parents get home. so i go on ticketmaster and order them for the 19th, again not realizing that the 19th is a SATURDAY!! so after i get the email confermation that i have the tickets etc etc.. i realize omg! the trip and my tickets are for saturday. there is no way im going to be able to leave madeleine and louis on saturday!!! so what to do... i think im just goin to exchange the tickets for sunday, and dan and i will just take the train up together. 

so like i said, i am totally the most observant person with the sharpest memory out there.... yea.

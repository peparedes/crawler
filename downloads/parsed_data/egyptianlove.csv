Once she was done unpacking, she looked around the room.  She didn't want to stay here, but she wasn't sure where to go."

<I>Dearest sister,

I'm sending you a ticket on one of those new-fangled jet aeroplanes.  I think it would be good if you come back to Egypt for the holiday.  I know I'd said you could stay, but I've found some interesting artifacts that you might want to take a look at.

Don't be angry with me.  Just come back, and everything will be fine.

Your brother,
Jonathon</i>

Evie shook her head, resigned, and started packing.  Once she was done, she sat at her desk and penned a letter to Fred:

<I>Dearest Fred,

I know I'd told you I wasn't going to Egypt for the holiday, but my brother sent me a letter and wants me to come after all.  If there were more time, I would ask you to come with, but he's only sent one ticket, and the aeroplane leaves this afternoon.  I am so sorry.  I'll bring you a souviner.

Yours,
Evelyn</i>

She opened her eyes and saw that she and Fred were tangled together.  That's when she remembered everything that had happened yesterday and Fred holding her and protecting her from whatever it was she was seeing. She had fallen asleep clinging to Fred, terrified that the knife was going to get her, also.

She carefully detached herself from Fred and went in to take a shower and was rinsing out her hair when the tears started streaming down her cheeks. She leaned her head against the wall and let the tears come.

<i>Someone had drugged them. Someone had infected her with something that had made her terrified for about 24 hours.</i>

Her trust and her mind had been violated.  She had no idea who had done it, but she would either find out herself or hire someone to do so. She wasn't sure what she had been exposed to or if it would have any long-term consequences.

She got dressed and pulled her hair back.

Time to face the friends and enemies she had scared to death.

She moaned.

"event","Evelyn had been up very late last night, going through her books and notes as she tried to prepare for the favor that Belthazor had asked of her. She was so exhausted by what she was doing, that she wasn't even aware as she passed out into a deep but fitful sleep at her desk...


<lj-cut text=""Here There Be Nightmares"">


<i>Belthazor knelt in a red-lit room, his head bowed.  Before him stood a large cloaked figure with blood-red wings. ""Belthazor,"" the figure said, his face completely hidden.  ""The Seer has felt the power of the Charmed Ones awaken.  She believes them to be at your school.""

""They are?"" Belthazor said, a hint of nervousness in his voice.

The figure nodded.  ""I am disappointed you have not sensed them yourself,Belthazor,"" it said.  ""You will return and find them.  And you will destroy them before their power has a chance to grow.""

""As you wish, my liege,"" Belthazor said, dipping his head lower.  But his expression was one of uncertainty.

...

The scene blurred and changed and became a graveyard at night.  Belthazor ran through the tombstones.  He was bleeding from several wounds, and carried an unconscious Paige in his arms.  Right behind him were Phoebe and Piper.  He led them behind a low stone wall, where he set Paige down.

""It's harder to track me in a cemetery,"" he told Phoebe and Piper, ""but they'll catch up eventually.  I'm going to lead them off.  Wake Paige up and get her to orb you back to the school.""

Phoebe grabbed at his arm.  ""Just shimmer us back, Cole!""

He shook his head.  ""I'm wounded, Phoebe. I could only take one of you. And I'm not leaving your sisters behind.""

""Be careful,"" she pleaded.  ""I don't want to lose you.""

He kissed her urgently, then stepped back.  ""Keep low.  Keep trying to wake Paige up and get out of here.  I'll meet up with you later.""  He gave Phoebe a last lingering look.  ""I love you, Phoebe, whatever happens.""

Piper pulled on Phoebe's shirt as Belthazor darted away. ""Phoebe, get down!"" she said insistently.

Phoebe obeyed, crouching down behind the wall, but keeping her eyes on Belthazor. 

Two demons shimmered on either side of him. He destroyed one with a fireball, but the other struck him and knocked him against a tombstone. The demon grabbed Belthazor while he was stunned and held an athame to his throat. 

""Where are the witches?"" he demanded.

""Go to hell,"" Belthazor snarled.

The demon thrust his blade into Belthazor chest.  He cried out in pain, then vanished as flames consumed him. 

""No!"" Phoebe screamed.

The demon turned toward the sisters, summoning a fireball to his hand.Before he could throw it , Paige stirred. Though groggy, she realized what was going on, and, grabbing both of her sisters, she orbed them out of the graveyard, leaving the fireball to pass through empty air.


...---...



The scene shifted again, back to Belthazor kneeling before the dark-cloaked bewinged figure. 

""Belthazor, the Seer has felt the power of the Charmed Ones awaken. She believes them to be at your school."" 

Belthazor nodded. ""I have an idea of who they might be.

""Excellent.  You will destroy them before their powers have a chance to grow,"" the hooded figure said.

The vision faded, then returned as a image of Belthazor and Phoebe sitting on the beach, watching the waves under the night sky.  Phoebe snuggled closer to Belthazor.  

""I love you,"" she said happily.

""Love you too,"" he said, then summoned an athame to his hand and stabbed it into Phoebe's chest.  She gasped in pain, and her eyes held betrayal and despair as her life bled from her.

Belthazor stood, dropping Phoebe's body to the sand.  He prodded her with his foot to make sure she was dead, then shimmered to Piper's room. She jumped up from her desk in surprise, and managed to say ""What are you-- ?"" before he threw a fireball, killing her. Paige's death soon followed.

Evelyn heard a knock at the door as the vision ended.</i>


</lj-cut>

""Who's there?"" she called out, opening her eyes.

The door was kicked open. 

""Hello, Evie,"" Belthazor said. He was in demonic form and held a bloody athame in his hand.

""You-you promised you wouldn't hurt me if I took your soul,"" Evie stammered, scrambling back on her bed.

""Just tying up loose ends,"" he said with a grin. He lunged at her and Evie threw up her hands and screamed. She felt the knife stab into her chest, then the vision truly ended, and she woke up, screaming at the top of her lungs with Fred fighting to hold her hands."

"event","<font size=""-2""><b>My Dear Jonathan,</b>

Coming to Fandom High has certainly been an eye-opening experience in so many ways. For the most part, the things I have been learning have kept me both entertained and intrigued. I have been taking quite a few classes, and I'm the teaching assistant for Dr. Daniel Jackson --- the Anthropology and Archaeology professor. Yes, I realize you sent me here to become more social with other people and to get involved with public functions and situations. However, I am very interested in what it is that I am doing.

My roommate, Fred, is a very sweet girl and I think that you would like her very much. <s>You will keep your hands to yourself and your lips away from her. She is to be my Homecoming date and I will not have you trying to seduce and charm her. Homecoming is apparently some sort of victory celebration.</s> She has no problems with my ideas and speculations of Magic and Curses. I can talk to her about anything and I have become quite attached to her.

In my ""Magic, Myth and Manipulation"" class, I have two intriguing guys that I partner up with for group exercises --- Angelus and Belthazor. Angelus is a vampire of some type and I've been told that Belthazor is some kind of evil demon. I don't know either of them well, but they really don't seem evil or demonic. <s>Oh alright, neither did that nice man who asked me to read that incantation that cursed his wife.</s> I happen to think I could rather learn a lot from the two of them.

I must ask you a simple question, Jonathan, and I want the god's honest truth. None of your lying and you powers of misdirection. How much research and investigation did you iniate on this school before you enrolled me here? I mean, really, Jonathan, zombies? ZOMBIES! Yes, during this past weekend, I spent most of my time stuck in the top of a tree. Why? I was hanging onto the upper branches of a tree for dear life because a group of zombies chased me up a tree.

Frankly, they reminded me a bit of some of your friends --- brainless and smelly.

If you sent me here in hopes of swindling some of these people, I am afraid that you are going to be greatly disappointed. Don't make that face at me, Jonathan Carnahan! I may be your baby sister, but that does not mean that I am blind to you and your antics. I will not participate in anay underhanded schemes that you may be contemplating. I will not do that, big brother of mine. In fact, I would feel that it is my duty to warn my fellow students of yoour intentions if you eeven mke an attempt. 

But, back to this business of the zombies attacking here this past weekend. There were these zombies that were attacking students and townies. Now, I know what you are thinking, but it wasn't my fault. I had nothing to do with it, I swear. <s>I haven't yet had a chance to search out and examine any interesting artifacts.</s>

Since I have been here, I have seen gremlins, vampires, zombies and a chicken with an uzi. Stop laughing, Jonathan. No, I am not kidding. A chicken armed itself with an uzi to fight the zombies and I have tried very hard not to think about how it would find one in such a small size.

I have to sign off now, Jonathan, as there is still quite a bit of clean up left to do around here. I miss you and look forward to seeing you at the upcoming Family Weekend.

<b>Love,
Evie</b></font>"

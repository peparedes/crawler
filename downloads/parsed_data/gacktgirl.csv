"event","Wow! I haven't posted here in nearly 2 years!! Yet I check it at least once a week lol!! How odd is that?? Well obviously Mike and I are married now. We moved down to Alabama to find some better jobs and get ourselves a house!  We got the house lol but we are still working on the better jobs thing.  We have decent jobs so far.  We both get full time hours and decent pay but I'm still striving for that 9-5 job.  Mike is lucky because he got the 6-2:30 job right off the bat!  Someday I'll get it and he even gets overtime like every week!! I can never have overtime at my job we get in trouble if we go over 40 lol.  They are silly there but whatever. 

  I'm still trying to decide on my major for school and I am supposed to go back this fall or at this rate possibly not till the Winter semester... Mike wants to start school as well but he has his major chosen already. 
  We got another cat too!! Her name is Bailey she was a barn kitty but she got attacked by the dog so we ended up taking her in as our new baby. She is evil as can be lol but adorable.

  Mike and I's 1-year anniversary is coming up here in exactly a month! How crazy is that?? It really doesn't feel like its been that long already. We haven't even decided what we are doing for it lol I took the day off of work so we can at least go out somewhere for the day.  Maybe well go to Alabama Adventures!! It's like this crazy water park/theme park thingy. 

  Still no babies thankfully!! We have enough to worry about with 2 cats lol and this house is like a giant baby!! Soo much work to do lol. It's not like its in bad shape or anything but it definitely needs some tlc in some spaces lol such as the dinged up walls which we have already had mudded just gotta sand them all down and finish painting the house up!! I wish it didn't take so much work to paint!!

  hmm well I gotta get going and get ready for another glorious day at work!! So to whoever is still reading this thanks for caring lol!! or not caring whichever!! :)

"event","This was one of the craziest weekends i have had in a long while. I went to the 89x birthday bash yesterday and then today i went to the zoo!!

The concert was awesome we saw MSI and AFI and Say anything and the YEAH YEAH YEAHS!! woo finally oh yeah and we saw the Never Ending White Lights and we sat next to the keyboarder's parents!! they were pretty funny. we saw some other people but i dont remember who all exactly... but it was a crazy concert we left my house at like noon and we were there till about 11! we had fun trying to find a parking spot lol i couldn't seem to drive into the parking lot but we ended up right across the street from all three stages in front of Comerica Park. On the drive there we didnt realize that the lane we were in merged from 3 lanes into 1 and we almost got killed by a semi!! so that was pretty fun.. We got free Jones Soda from the cool Chevy people. Some dude attacked me and Sarah and that was pretty scary so we ran away and hid amongst a large group of people so he couldn't see us... people offered us all beer which was funny.  MSI was awesome and the drummer, Kitty, fell out of her seat at the end which was quite funny to see cuz all you could see was her feet poking up and all the stage guys running up there to catch the speakers from falling on her lol  i bought an MSI shirt and a YEAH YEAH YEAHs shirt they are quite spiffy!  in all i had lots of fun going oh yeah and i went with jessi, john, sarah, and keith! i love you guys lol especially your backpack bottle keith! we got home at about 12:15-ish and i didnt go to bed until about 1 and then the next morning i had to get up at 5 to get ready to go to the zoo!! so i only got about 4 hours of sleep!! and i had to drive to and from the concert and then to and from the zoo which was a 2 and a half hour drive to get too!! 

We went to the Binder Park Zoo up in Battle Creek and i got in free because my mom bought this zoo pass for Michigan zoo's which is awesome!! we walked all over that zoo for like 5 hours it was crazy fun mining for gold with carol lol oh yeah Mike, Sarah, Shaun, Jenna, Carol, Ken, and I all went to the zoo we took my dad's monster van.  we had fun playing in the misters and running in the rain we got lots of pictures of carol riding strange animals like ants... ants are her favorite... lol then after we were done in the zoo we went out and ate our food and realized we forgot plates and napkins lol so i searched my dads van and found a ton of Mcdonalds napkins in the glovebox!! yay!! we left around 2 something and we got home around 5ish but on the way home was horrible cuz i was sooo tired and everyone else fell asleep and people in front of us had no brake lights so i had to keep slamming on my brakes and the middle seats dont have seatbelts so carol and jenna kept flying out of them lol but we had a scary experience some guy in front of me was on his cell phone and he started to pull over on the left side of the road which was all gravelly and when he went to the side of the road he tried to brake too hard and his car went in the ditch up out of the ditch and he spun around in the road and ended up like 5 ft in front of me facing my car!! and he stayed on the cell phone the whole freaking time!! i have never been so terrified in my life!! i am so glad that my dad has good brakes in his van cuz i did not think that i was going to stop in time.. it was like slow motion lol and everybody flew forward in my car and carol and jenna woke up pretty harshly... i just had bad luck driving this week lol but my dad has full coverage on the van so it would have been ok if i had like bumped him or something but thankfully i didnt so yeah after i stopped we all just kinda sat there for a second and then he moved over to the side of the road, still on his cell phone mind you, and he just kept on talking and i just kinda drove off really slow and so did everyone else around me lol it was nuts!! 
oo a funny thing i just remembered... Sarah got pooped on by a bird... lol thank you shout wipes!! ^__^

ok well im gonna go now and take a nap or someting cuz im sleepy still

sarah, ken, kim, and I all dropped our human sexuality class after the first 1 1/2 hours of it lol it was psycho my teacher was a total lunatic perverted old man guy!! thing!!! first we get our syllabus which is 32!! pages long and then he starts talking about stuff we have to do in the class. We have to buy special scantrons to take our big tests on and then we had to have a bunch of the regular ones because we take a test every day in the class called the terrible twenties which is totally stupid!  we have to buy this special little notebook that you can only get at the college bookstore which is expensive and has very little paper in it. then we had a paper to write about how we learn for our first day homework and we had to keep a time chart of when and how much we studied and we are required to do it everyday! then he told us we would have to write four 6-page minimum papers about these certain topics in our book. im sure there is something else i just cant think anymore about it i was so angry!! so we all just got up during the break and left! 

now we are in comparative religion... i hope this turns out well lol 

so my schedule is that i start school at 11:00 am and i go to Psychology of Adolescence until 12:25 then i have a lunch break! haha!! i made one this year for myself lol yay!  then at 2:00 i go to my English class which is kinda weird we had to write an essay on our first day so she could judge our writing styles... lol it was strange so anyways after that i go straight to my Accounting class from 4 till 6 and then on mondays i would go to my comparative religions class from 6-9 and if it was wednesday i get to come home at 6! yay! which i did today it took like a half hour to get out of the parking lot cuz it was rush hour!! blech!

ive spent a grand total so far on books of $375 and i still have to buy my comparative religions book!! its insanity.. my books cost me neraly as much as the classes do lol

My dad wants to open a gaming store that sells/buys video games and also has DDR machines in it and it will be so awesome he is looking into it very much and has gone and priced DDR machines already only about $3350.00 for the 1st mix i do believe how exciting!! i would live there lol i would get to work there instead of at Taco Bell!! YAYY!! new job!! and ive asked people about it and they have all said that it would be a great idea.  And!! my dad said that Mikey could live with us!! YES!! well until he finds his own place but ill probably move out with him when that happens... hehe! *dances* I'm excited and I really hope that this works cuz real estate reallly sucks at bringing in money...

"event","yeah the other day was a realllly bad day but then next day it was better and today its all good

so yeah friday night jenn asked if i could work later cuz someone quit and was supposed to close that night she wanted me to close for him and i was like no way cuz i had to open the next morning so i said id stay till 11:30 well i ended up staying till about 12:30 and didnt get to bed till about 1 and i had to get up at 7 to work at 8 yeah right... 
so the next morning i got up at 8:05 and i was supposed to start work at 8 not so good but whatever i was only like five mins late and they didnt care then at work i burnt myself and i was way tired then i got to work on drive thru woo... and when i finally got to leave they were counting my drawer by hand cuz our counter is still broken and TB is too cheap to buy a new one my drawer was 40 short yeah so i was extremely mad then Pam found 20 next to the drop box which was good but we were still missing 20 so cheryl said she would look that night in the safe for it so i was like whatever and i left 
well i got outside and attempted to turn my car on and well it stalled right out... yep just poof nothing so at that point i just started crying... it was a veryyy bad day yup then i called my mom to have her come pick me up and she couldnt get her van to start cuz her battery was dead or something like that so she had to drive my dads giant van of doom up to get me so i had to go inside and tell them that my van was going to be chilling in the parking lot for the rest of the day cuz i couldnt get it started and they offered me free food but i was sooo mad i was like whatever i just want to go home right now cuz i was still mad about the whole money thing cuz when your drawer is short you get a write up and the money comes out of our paychecks! grr ive had it happen once before with ten dollars and it sucked... 

so anyways i get home and jenn was here and she made me think about taco bell so i got more mad so i just went and took a shower well i got that venus vibrance razor thingy and i went to use it and my battery was fricking dead!! so i was extremely very very angry at that point so i yelled at the razor which did nothing for the battery lol so then i got out of the shower and that was the end of my bad day cuz then i went to the fair with jenny and i had fun with her and loren we rode lots of rides ate wendys and shrunk our hips lol so it was all good after that
but then the next day i work up late again!! i was late but so was the manager so it didnt matter she punched us in for exactly 8 but we technically didnt start until 9 lol and she didnt realize that she did that so later she had to go back and fix it cuz she gave us all a free hour and Cheryl found the missing 20 which was great so i didnt had to be written up or lose money in my paycheck thank god!! and i also took my portion test which i totally did so good on!! 

then today i actually woke up on time well close to it at least i had a half hour before work started when i got out of bed yay! i ate breakfast for the first time in 3 days!! lol i love breakfast yum food in the morning 

i worked till about 12 then they sent me home cuz we were so dead.... it was great it was like free time basically in the two hours i was there we had about 9 customers so yeah it was grand!! then i got a crunchwrap!! i love working there sometimes cuz emps get special foods just for them lol 

and then i hung out with jessi till she went to work and then sarah and shaun came over and watched Orgazmo with me which was thrilling... and now im here and im dead tired and i dont work tomorrow YES! i can finish my homework finally lol im almost done!!

so yeah i love you all!!

"event","my mikey is home!! for a short while of course... but hes still home!! *huggles* so i went over there last night and this morning and im going over there tomorrow also and we are going to go out and do something!  he is more tan than i am lol its kinda sad... 

so yeah his grandma's house will be having its closing on this thursday so they have to have everything out of the house by tomorrow which is gonna be fun im gonna help some tomorrow i helped today by packing up mikeys bedroom wow his room is messy!!  

then i went to work and i made food!!! it was amazing i have never made food for so long! i did it for 3 whole hours!! im so proud of myself i only forget two meximelts lol i left them in the steamer.... oops! aw well the lady was nice about it though which was cool

when i was eating my food at like 9:30ish some lady flew into the parking lot and hit some other guy who was backing up and yeah it was interesting cuz they just sat there blocking traffic for like 10 minutes it was stupid cuz they barely touched each other... yep it was retarded...

then i came home and my dad made me help him and jessi move our bricks for the patio in the backyard  
my back hurts... they each weigh over 20 lbs and they are giant squares of doom.... but they look cool!! ^^

oh yeah the other day i went to the armada fair with sarah, shaun, cat, and i saw mary there and it was fun we saw pigs and cows lol ""is that a pig?"" sarah you know what i mean... lol oh yeah and the psycho sheep and the obnoxious tractor pull that gave me goosebumps and sarah and i rode the scrambler during the fireworks and we were attacked by bugs which was joyous 

yep this mouse pad thingy is really annoying me i keep touching it with my wrists and thumbs on accident and it keeps clicking random places and i type in a another word and yeah its annoying i need to get one of those usb mouses... and i also need money lol 

i got paid today for 13 hours i got 73 after taxes so thats pretty good 
but now i have to buy my books and those are gonna cost me like 200 dollars or something crazy im sure! so im probably going to close my savings account and put all my money into my checking for now until i have enough money to have a savings account there cuz its a 300 minimum and i have 450 right now so ill probably have to use a lot of it but maybe not you never know  

ok well im gonna go now and kill my hamster cuz its really annoying 

love ya!!

Then i got to go to work at 9 so i got up at 8 so i got about 3.5 hours of sleep cuz i didnt go to bed until 4:30 so that wasnt very fun but thankfully they only kept me there till about 1:30ish they let me go home cuz i couldnt understand people in drivethru lol i was sleepy!

so yeah the trip was fun  we went on 4 tours

historic tour, violet city lantern tour, frozen niagara tour, and the lost river cave tour!  They were all fun

Bee's are not cool... while i was unpacking stuff from the trip we discovered a dead bee sitting in a pot lol it just plopped right out onto the counter and my mom thought it was pretty amusing... 

We ate at Joe's Diner... Yum!!! i love milkshakes!! lol

so then we saw the party bus!! which was totally awesome because we all know what was going on inside of it because it was obviously like a subway car party bus thingy! and they had confetti poofers that sucked the ground up and poofed it out the top!! oh yeah!

and then there was the caboose (end of the train for those who dont know that word) yeah someone had been driving it like in tennesee and we had gotten off at a rest stop and got back on and there it was again! and we passed it and got off in like kentucky somewhere then we got back on and it was in front of us as we got on the eway it was pretty funny so we took pictures ill post them on my webshots account along with others

yep umm we passed big bone lick state park and bluelick road and Needmore Road it was fun  oh and we played some fun games in the car 

now im home and im sleepy and i have this slurpee next to me that is totally melted 

sarah and i went and played ddr today it was fun i played on heavy for Let's Groove and it was fun and we felt like goo together lol and we drank mountain dew and for dinner we ate bread pizza with weird cheese it was kinda gross...

"event","Yay I'm back now from my vacation which was lots of fun! For those who don't know I went to Mackinac Island, Mackinac City, Hale, Oscoda, and all over the place for the past week! It was enjoyable...Oh yeah i went with Sarah and Cat! umm well we went to the island and had fun buying fudge and walking uphill and being stared at by the little boy scouts lol!

 we went to the fort and watched someone get arrested and watch the trial it was a mock one just to let you know but it was pretty funny.  

We took a ton of pictures and we froze our buns off on top of the Arnold Line ferry woo it looked warm and sunny but it was icey! I bought souvenirs for my family and mike sorry everyone else you can look at the pictures as a souvenir cuz i ran out of money lol but the pics are great cuz we all had our bathing suits on and sarah gave us all a cleavage shot lol ^^ 

umm so yeah we ate at this awesome grille on the island i cant remember the name but it was like a mobster place the menus had bullet holes in them which was cool looking we all had chicken strips which were really good *yum* ^^ 

so then we went home to the cottage in oscoda like 2-3 hours away lol which was fun to drive ^^ especially since it was like super dark and foggy and rainy everynight we hit a total of 2 frogs i believe and we saw a furry thing run across the street! hehe 

the next day we just went to the city cuz it was so expensive to go on the ferry 18 bucks a person yuck!!  we went to the lighthouse and fort michilimackinac and it rained a lot and we met this guy named Ben lol he was the priest in the church there and he also shot a gun and the cannon and they couldnt get the cannon to light so they asked the audience who had a lighter and sarah had one so she gave it to him to use it was really funny then later that night we saw him with his girlfriend at the store in mackinac city which was hillarious cuz his girlfriends name was catherine hehe I'm sure Cat remembers that one right? lol 

I bought some stuff from those places for my mom and dad and also a poncho for myself cuz it was pouring rain outside which was quite poopy! but we survived

Then we went home again on our long drive and i fell asleep thankfully cat drove ^^ 

the next day we drove around and went to lumbermans monument and iargo springs than that night we went to the beach and played in the freeezing cold water and it was fun cuz we wrote road trip 2005 cat, stina, sarah in the sand and took pics of it hehe 

the last day we just kinda chilled in the cottage and ate and watched tv while we watched for the laundry to finish then we left at 11:30 and we made it home by 3:11 yay! were so cool that was with a half hour lunch break! at Taco Bell of course we all had a crunchwrap supreme god i love those things they are addicting!! mmm crunchy lol 

so yeah then i went to Ken's graduation! YAY!! GO KEN!! we were gonna go out to have pizza but the place was closed so we couldn't so then we went home and shaun drove my car and it stalled lol and he said lots of stuff i didnt know what they meant and told my dad them so my dad can try something new to fix my vehicle 

so now we are on today and ive done nothing..well i made my bed... and did my laundry... but my room is a mess im still unpacking hehe so yeah im waiting for mike to come home so i guess ill go clean now

"event","Today was really tiring.
I got out of bed really early because I had terrible stomach cramps.

I feel good because today Im getting my lip pierced! Finally! Mom said I could and she's signed the forms and EVERYTHING!

I'm so happy. I just found out that I have been accepted into Harvard. And Yale. I don't know which to choose... oh, why is life so hard sometimes?

Last night I had to go and pay Joshua's bail. He's such a jerk. He got arrested for punching the Walmart clerk in the face for refusing to sell him beer. He's only 16!

I want to tell the world that I love you all! You're all so special to me!

I am really annoyed with those assholes at _are_you_hotter_than_us_?, because I am so much cuter than them, and those photos don't do me justice. They can't reject me, so I'm starting my own rating community. Click here to join (the first five applicants are automatically accepted).

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! Here's some photos of my girlfriend in the nude (but don't tell her that I've posted them here - she'll kill me! Har har.)

I want to say thanks to the world for absolutely fucking nothing! You all suck. I feel so alone, no one ever reads this journal, or even comments to let me know that I'm not suffering alone. It's cold here, and I want to die, but I cannot figure out how many of you to take with me when I go.

I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have bipolar disorder, and a healthy imagination.

You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you you're a moron.

In a world of pollution, profanity, adolescence, zits, broccoli, racism, ozone depletion, sexism, stupid guys, and PMS, why the hell do people still tell me to have a nice day? --Unknown 

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with my favourite Buffy fan-fiction piece I wrote last year when I was in hospital.

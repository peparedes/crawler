Life since I've been away from Paris has been.... Crazy. Everything I wanted, but nothing I expected. Isn't it nice when that happens?
I guess I'm going to stay cryptic for now, but just know that 
everything

swimming
and I really couldn't be happier."

amazing.

And then my maman was here for a week, which really was amazing. Notre Dame, Sacre Coeur, Le Bon Marche, Louvre, Le Marais, Bastille, Musee D'Orsay, Arc de Triomphe, Champs Elysees, Latin Quarter, Parc des Buttes Chaumont, Pere Lachaise Cemetiere, Chatenay-Malabry. And she cried at the airport and I love her so so much. She's my mom- we're supposed to have ups and down. That's just... La vie. She really is my hero and favourite woman on this planet:

This weekend, I went to the C, and played Poker with my French friends... I lost. Evidemment. Quelle surprise!! (sarcasm). But. I did learn that ""I fold"" in French is ""Je me couche"". Get it? Like.. I'm sleeping. haha. I thought it was cute.

New Year's was possibly even better.
And now my mom is here, visiting me in Paris. And it's the most up and down moments of my life, I swear. This woman is my best friend one moment, and makes me want to shoot myself the next.
Two more days and I get to see Florian and play French Trivial Pursuit again.
I'm seriously looking forward to that."

I took a trip to Chatenay-Malabry (the ""C"") Met his whole family, talked with his grandparents (ALL in French!), ate really good French desserts, played French Trivial Pursuit, had his grandma help me cheat while playing French Trivial Pursuit, went to a house party with all of his friends, saw ""Je Suis Une Legende"" (I Am Legend) in theatres (in French-- no English) with all his friends, drove in a little French car, etc. It was an amazing week-end. Really. I'm so French now it's ridiculous.

"event","Wow. I can't believe it's already December! aahhhh. We have yet to buy a Christmas tree, but don't worry: That is going to happen very very soon. And we're having another infamous house party in celebration of the holidays on December 20th! :)I'm exciteddddd

Okay, here's some catching up from the past few weeks, because I suck at updating. 

I got stopped in the mall by a stylist here in Paris, who wants me to model for him. His name's Vincent Brasseur, and Gobhina and Miriam came with me to a rendez-vous with him and another model, and he bought us all drinks in a cafe and then we went on some crazy trip to a french television studio where we ended up (somehow...) in the audience of some French variety show... Weird. It was ridiculous and over-the-top but we got free sandwiches, so c'est la vie...

I kind of went to Rome for a weekend, on November 30, with Gobhina, Axel, Miriam, and Brenda. That was awesome. We saw the Vatican, Pantheon, Collosseum, Trevi Fountain (where a big group of Japanese tourists thought I was someone famous and kept asking me to take pictures with them... which, of course, I did! I guess I'm famous in Japan...)
anyways, here's Roma:

aeroport

priests are cool, too
<img src=""http://i217.photobucket.com/albums/cc57/katieparis/ROMA/Roma005.jpg"">

so we finally had left Paris, the land of the strikes, for a while, and RIGHT when we get to the Rome metro, guess what we find! A STRIKE! but it's okay cus it only lasted for about half hour and then the metro worked again...
<img src=""http://i217.photobucket.com/albums/cc57/katieparis/ROMA/Roma007.jpg"">

so tired from traveling
<img src=""http://i217.photobucket.com/albums/cc57/katieparis/ROMA/DSC02920.jpg"">

..but we had to go out anyways.. so here's Axel NOT being a tourist...

"event","First and foremost, let me just make it known that the French do not like working, and avoid it whenever possible. One example is how often they strike (when the metro workers strike, the metro stops working, meaning basically we can't get anywhere because our life is the metro, meaning school is out of the question). Which leads me to my other point: I had class only one day last week. One out of four. Not beause of a strike (thank God) but because it was the week of Toussaint, which is like a big deal here apparently. It means ""All Saints"" day and it's a holiday, and I don't even think they do anything to celebrate it, they just like to have an excuse to not have to work.
Another fun fact about France: THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND HALLOWEEN. i saw a handful of small children dressed up, and it made me so sad. And they were just witches. boo.
Alright. Halloween night. We drank a lotttt, and eventually realised it was too much, but by then I was already really drunk, so whatever.
We walked along the Champs Elysees for like an hour trying to find this stupid club that when we eventually DID find it, they took one look at Miriam and I and turned us away. Apparently, we were visually noticeably completely waaaasted. Who would've thought. So on the lovely walk back, we realise the metro is closed so we search for a bus, which we finally give up on and decide to just take a taxi. During this time, I literally WALKED INTO A BENCH. So my leg is completely bruised and messed up now. Great. And some guys in the metro tried to touch us and we werent having that. Plus, on the Champs Elysees, someone stole Axel's camera. So this is just a horrible Halloween night for virtually everyone. God, I'm glad I was drunk so I don't remember much. 
I like to remember happy things, you see. (This is me being optimistic).
So we got home, and Miriam passed out, as did Gobhina. And Harold, our French friend Florian, and I stayed up and dancedddd until 6am, where it gets reallll fuzzy for me, and I passed out.

Anyways. Lots of bad, but I actually really enjoyed myself. Haha. No. Really! The dance party was funnnn :]

I was Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany's :]

Friday night, we went to our Morrocan friend's apartment, and they had hookah duh because they're... well... they're Morrocan. aha. Naturally, right? So we smoked hookah and some hash and Axel and I bought our own 1 euro PLASTIC wine bottles and we had a dance party.

I've drank wine out of a glass bottle, and I've drank it out of a box, but this was my first time with a PLASTIC bottle

would you still be in my dreams



My answer? A resounding YES.


I uploaded a bunch of old pictures onto my ""sadiehaakens"" photobucket, and of course along with that came a lot a lot of reminiscing. I miss my life. Paris is a dream, and when I wake up I'll be back right where I know I belong. And I love dreaming, but you have to wake up at some point, and I'm so happy to know my waking life is something good. :]"

There were SO MANY people. I HATE shoving through and stepping through millions of people. Miriam and I peed in the bushes, TWICE. I have never peed in public more than I have here in Paris. heh. The game was France vs. England. England won. We sat next to these two French guys, and shared our goods. After the game, we (Harold, Miriam, and I) and the two guys got a bottle of bacardi and went back to our apartment, and hung out. We played King's Cup en francais and listened to music and drankkkk and one of the guys told me I look like BJORK (that's a new one) and I asked if that was a compliment, and he said ""OH yes. That is DEFINITELY a compliment."" But still. Sorry. I DO NOT look like Bjork. She's like, asian. (although- my mom IS chinese, so I guess that could work... ahaha kateybee that one was for you). I guess we made crepes and then they left at some point. ha

yeah. amaaaazinggg.

went to church/worship tonight. a new one and it's THE BEST CHURCH i've ever been to. i'm in love. we're going every friday night. miriam, harold, brenda, and i. the church crew. hollerrrr. it's australian-based. the pastor is aussie and the congregation is from everywhere, and mostly college-age and best worship service ever. and best part: it was in english, AND french. :] i sang to God in french. 


annnnddd i just found out that the words ""Hella"" and ""Hecka"" and ""Hyphy"" are strictly Californian. Or, as my roomies like to say, ""Cali."" heh. cyoooot.


and i got a new necklace:

"event","went to le queen. got hit on by farrr too many guys. axel commented on how he needs to be with me constantly to fend off the boys, just in case they get TOO creepy. which. they do. because no boys are creepier than EUROPEAN boys. ughhhh.
 it was ladie's night, so we got free makeup kits AND free champagne and vodka! at one point, the bartender was pouring vodka in my mouth. that was hot. got into the VIP section and danced our hearts out. took the night bus at 5am. passed out.

today i had my poetry workshop class. EASIEST class of my life. and i still get units, so hollerrr. i have to write a poem about my first day in Paris. that should be good.

this weekend is Nuit Blanche. I'm excited. it's saturday, and the city stays alive alllll day/night and we get free breakfast in public buildings on sunday morning. yea-yeahhh."

today g and m and i checked out a flea market in the 20th. random. i got a pretty blue diamond looking ring for 1.50 euro and some cheap razors. lame otherwise though. antique fair's better.

and on metro ride home, i hopped off the train and FELL. totally scrubbed. and it hurt so bad and i was lying there for an instant and an australian guy was like ""i missed it. can you do that again?"" or something but my roommates helped me up and across to our flat and told me i fell gracefully at least and i looked like a model lying there on the metro floor. heh. coulda been worse."

"event","yesterday i was finally feelin better, but still stayed in bed and drank tea. went grocery shopping, which was badly badly needed. i made real food! i cooked chicken with rice and carrots and corn and it actually turned out REALLY GOOD!
hair party with roomies. I cut and dyed everyone's hair, including my own. I'm Super Katie.
took shots, had mini dance party, talked to douglas for a while :] and took over-the-phone shots together.
went out to Gibu's for Alex's birfday. Hip Hop club in paris?! It was amaaazing. such good music. 
there were photographers:

"event","I went out for the first time in Paris on thursday, september 6. With a good group of the MICEFA students from Cite. We went to Mix Paris, which is a club that's free for international peple (just show your passport) every thursday night. We drank wine and some vodka/orange before hand. I call it pre-gaming, everyone else calls is pre-drinking. heh. Danced my little booty off for sure. It was reallllly fun.

And we found a great apartment! After our crazy wild goose chase of searching high and low in every possible area of Paris, we FOUND AN APARTMENT! :] It's in the 19th and it's directly across from a Metro stop which is perfect and it's HUGE compared to like every other apartment in paris AND! it's only 280 euro a person per month! SO CHEAP.  So we're moving in today and I'm really essited. Finally something a bit more permanent, for a while."

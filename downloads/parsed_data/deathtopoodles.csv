"event","I haven't posted anything in a long while... I guess it's a combination of being busy, not wanting to, and forgetting.&nbsp; 

I guess my biggest news at the moment is that I have been pre-approved for a mortgage for a place that I love.&nbsp; It isn't built yet... but I've seen the same unit already and it is just perfect.&nbsp; It is a duplex and I get to pick out all of the finishes.&nbsp; While I'm horrified of living alone, I'm excited at the prospect of having something I can say is mine.&nbsp; 

My job is going just great.&nbsp; I was on call the last two nights and I have a ridiculous cold, but&nbsp;I didn't get called in so essentially I got paid to toss and turn in bed.&nbsp; They hired another ultrasound tech so the call is even more split up now!&nbsp; My abdominal registry exam is a week from today... hopefully it will be my last.&nbsp; My health insurance has kicked in and my retirement fund is growing!

My ferret is totally cute.&nbsp; She is pretty tame and lets me hold her all of the time.&nbsp; Annoyingly, she doesn't quite have the litter box thing down, but it doesn't make too much of a mess nor does it smell.&nbsp; She sleeps in her hammock and inside a plush octopus.&nbsp; She's the cutest little bandita ever!

I've started acquiring furniture for my new place!&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a ton of fun to pick out appliances and things.&nbsp; Too bad it costs so darn much!&nbsp;&nbsp;Those lucky people who got married first... I envy your registries! &nbsp;

Ah, well.&nbsp; I hope everyone else has had an enjoyable summer!&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been left at home while everyone else goes camping/water skiing... with the dog.&nbsp; Joyous."

I'm living in Colorado now.&nbsp; I'm not sure I like it better.&nbsp; Well, I like the small town better than the big city.&nbsp; I do not like the weather better and I do not like the people better.&nbsp; I have a great paying job and the hours aren't bad.&nbsp; However, I work with the biggest bitch I've ever encountered.&nbsp; She bad mouthes me behind my back unprovoked, speaks to me as if I'm a child, thinks she is God's gift to rural Colorado, looks at my images in the machine's hard drive when I'm not there, and refuses to be thankful for all of the help I give her.&nbsp; And then, after all of that, has the nerve to ask me if I'll pick up weekend shifts for her.&nbsp; Ya right, bitchface.&nbsp; She's miserably unhappy and takes it out on me. 

But yay for a sign on bonus!&nbsp; Yay for getting $5 more an hour!&nbsp; Yay for only working four days a week!&nbsp; Yay for it being a small hospital that isn't very busy at all.&nbsp; Yay for health insurance!&nbsp; Yay for them covering all of our moving expenses!&nbsp; Yay for an ""economic"" temporary pay boost to cover some fuel costs.&nbsp; Most of all, yay for management liking me and knowing that the other chick is a super bitch.

There are bad points though... I can't make it to Amanda's wedding, Sarah's wedding, or the XF: I Want to Believe premiere in Albuquerque with all of my Phile Phriends.&nbsp; I feel horrid about all of these things.&nbsp; I'm so sorry.

Our house in Albuquerque sold and closes on Wednesday.&nbsp; Kelli will be in Colorado beginning Thursday and we're going to put an offer in on a house on Friday!&nbsp; That means, hopefully, we'll have a house by the end of June!&nbsp; I've been staying in a furnished apartment that is the top floor of an ancient farmhouse.&nbsp; The angles are very unique!

I went home the first week of May to see my brother.&nbsp; He was on leave from the USAF in Alaska.&nbsp; I had a blast hanging out with him!&nbsp; It was too bad I didn't have access to a vehicle because I wanted to see so many people and didn't get to do it.

Hope all is well with everyone!&nbsp; I miss you."

Rock Band is my new favorite thing.&nbsp; Kelli sings, her brother John is on drums and I've got guitar.&nbsp; Any random Joe who comes over gets to be bass.&nbsp; Our characters are HOT and we can play for hours and not even notice that time has flown by!&nbsp; 

I finally got health insurance.&nbsp; Whoopee.&nbsp; It has done me no bloody good.&nbsp; There are no primary physicians in this area accepting new patients at this time.&nbsp; Hell, come to find out a couple nights ago my insurance DOESN'T EVEN COVER WHAT I GOT IT FOR!&nbsp; They give a general overview of their coverage when you are picking one out and it made no mention of this, so when I cracked open the 93743979 page book and found the page on it I was devastated.&nbsp; Damn this whole system!&nbsp; New Mexico hates me!

So we're moving (yes, this means me too).&nbsp; House is supposedly going on the market in January.&nbsp; I'm still not that thrilled, but I can't help but catch Kelli's excitement about the whole thing.&nbsp; There is a job prospect for me... so we'll see how that pans out.&nbsp; For now we're redoing practically everything in the house.&nbsp; Oh joy.&nbsp; Pulling up tile, painting, cleaning, boxing and packing.&nbsp; Just what I want to do after working 60 hours a week.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Picking out houses online is kind of fun."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, when I was a child of only about eight years old, I went with my friend and her mother to one of their friends' homes.&nbsp; Her mother needed to drop off some laundry she had done for them while they were getting their clothes dryer repaired.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had never particularly cared for these friends of theirs.&nbsp; They were very different from my own family.&nbsp; She had been divorced and remarried more than once.&nbsp; They lived in a trailer.&nbsp; Their kids were younger enough than me to make it feel awkward when we were forced to play together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, we went there one stormy October night to drop off clean laundry.&nbsp; At once when we walked in something felt amiss.&nbsp; Us kids were shooed off to play while the three adults shared a beer.&nbsp; This was fine until we heard quite a commotion coming from the living room.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amber, my friend and the oldest of the five children present, went first and I followed closely behind.&nbsp; When I walked into the living room no prior life experience had prepared me for what I was going to witness:&nbsp; The friends were in the middle of some sort of domestic dispute.&nbsp; I had never heard someone say the word 'fuck' until then.&nbsp; I only knew it couldn't be a good word. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, they were standing and lunged toward each other.&nbsp; Looking back I know they were both drunk.&nbsp; He grabbed her by the shoulders and was trying to push her to the ground.&nbsp; She fought back!&nbsp; She jumped and kicked at him, attempting to fend him off.&nbsp; She was making sharp yelp noises and he was grunting every time he deflected a blow.&nbsp; Thoughout the whole thing they hurled insults at each other that elementary students can't comprehend.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lightning flashed and thunder cracked, shaking the trailer.&nbsp; An image I will never forget: His eyes, blazing with anger, glared heavily at her while his entire frame became outlined by the flashing light.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend's dear mother kept saying frantically, ""Stop it!&nbsp; Stop it!&nbsp; You're scaring the kids!""&nbsp; I was crying and so was Amber.&nbsp; Their kids were huddling under a table; they were veterans of this sort of behavior.&nbsp; Out of nowhere, he turned to Amber's mother and pushed her to the floor.&nbsp; Amber shrieked as her mother just sat there, shocked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come to find out this whole horrible scene was caused by a simple argument over placement of drink coasters.&nbsp; That was the night when I decided I never wanted to have a conflict with anyone.&nbsp; Ridiculous?&nbsp; Perhaps, but I've never outgrown that image.&nbsp; I'm haunted by the stranger's fiery eyes and violent outburst on my friend's mother who was only trying to stand up for what is right."

"event","If you know me you know how I feel about holidays: they're for family time.&nbsp; It is for that reason alone I've agreed to go with Kelli up to visit her brother, sister-in-law and their two young daughters in Telluride, CO this Friday-Monday.&nbsp; It's kind of a resort town where celebs and rich people buy ski ""cabins"" that are actually huge mansions and they only stay part of the time.&nbsp; It's supposedly beautiful, but I'll be the judge of that.&nbsp; Her parents will be up there, too.&nbsp; Kelli and I are staying in their ""cabin"" with them.&nbsp; She's going skiing and crap so I'll be all alone with study time for quite a while.&nbsp; I'll have to do the church thing, but lunch after it should make up for that.

I still haven't found a bloody job.&nbsp; I've been applying for office positions left and right, lab positions, clerk positions.... what the hell!&nbsp; I fail at life, apparently.




So everyone have a happy Easter with friends and family!&nbsp; I miss you all, take care!"

I don't really know about that, but the picture is cute.


Today is Get a Bloody Job Day!  Wee!  Wish me luck!!!!

Yesterday we spent all day shopping for food and cooking.  It was a lot of fun.  Kelli doesn't treat me like the cooking moron I am, which is nice.  So we had a sea bass feast and will again tonight!!!  I can't wait!  

It's getting close to April... we're going to Telluride, CO for Easter to visit her brother and sister-in-law and their two daughters.  I think her parents will be there, too.  It will be an experience.  Then the next weekend we have a Warcraft visitor coming from Boston.  That will be a fun week!  The next weekend after that her same brother and sister-in-law/family are coming here for a visit.  What a busy month!  I have to pick a date for my abdominal boards... I'm thinking the end of April that way it won't be in the middle of all of that chaos."

"event","Another sunny Monday in Albuquerque.&nbsp; Too bad I just got an official rejection in the mail from my dream job.&nbsp; I did, however, get a job offer as a receptionist in a vet's office.&nbsp; It's a very serene place and it's off the beaten trail in a cool area of New Mexico so I'm kind of excited that if I have to ""settle"" for a job for the time being this will be okay.&nbsp; 

My brother is leaving in about a week for the USAF.&nbsp; It makes me sad that he's going somewhere where I can't protect him anymore.&nbsp; Not that I could really do it from here, anyway... but that's not the point.&nbsp; It's nice to know that I'll see him online every once in a while and get to chat; when he goes away I'm going to miss him so much.&nbsp; 

ZOMG I got my ears pierced.&nbsp; What kind of a girly girl am I becoming?!?!?!?!

I lost enough weight to go down a pants size and not feel too fat in tank tops!&nbsp; Hurray!&nbsp; 


Lonliness has set in and the realization that I have no one to call up and go out for dinner with has become very real.&nbsp; No lunch dates, no drinks with friends, no DDR parties.&nbsp; It really sets in when Kelli goes out with her family... who will take me out for birthday dinner?&nbsp; Who will celebrate with me when I finally do get a ""real"" job down here?&nbsp; I threw a pity party for myself on Saturday.&nbsp; I'll get over it."

"event","We went to see ""Zodiac"" last night.&nbsp; It was a good movie; not scary, kind of dragged on a bit and much longer than I thought, but still good.&nbsp; (I'm also a serial killer phile but Kelli isn't and she thought it was all right, too.)&nbsp; 

Red Wings were on NBC today so I got to watch!&nbsp; Hurray!!!&nbsp; Too bad they lost to freaking Colorado, and Kelli's whole family are Avalanche fans.&nbsp; Grrrrrrrrrr.

Kelli still seems quite oblivious to the fact that she only thinks about herself 90% of the time.&nbsp; I don't really know how to say anything to her about it, either.&nbsp; She never really talks to me about anything too deep, and if she does it is quite brief.&nbsp; I love listening, I wish she'd open up.



Oh, and people better call me about all of the jobs I applied for last week.&nbsp; Kkthx."

"event","So... as some of you may know I've been studying hardcore for my abdominal registry exam.&nbsp; I filled out my application and paid the $200 for it on the first of the month.&nbsp; I still hadn't gotten my exam confirmation letter thing so I called today to see why.&nbsp; Apparently when you apply online there's a popup frame when you're finished with the application that tells you if you need to send anything in... and also apparently the ARDMS website is not fully Mozilla friendly.... and so when there was no frame I assumed I had to send nothing in.&nbsp; But that's not true, says the lady I talked to today.&nbsp; My ""clinical verification form"" that I used in October for physics was supposed to be good for a year, and it is... BUT the tech who signed it for me is registered in OB/gyn and not in ABD so I'm out my money.&nbsp; And they didn't tell me that.&nbsp; And now I just wasted a month.&nbsp; And I still don't have a job.&nbsp; And I cried when I got off of the phone.&nbsp; *sigh*

Oh a personally happier note... my WoW guild is starting a new instance tonight for the first time and Kelli and I are both really excited about it.&nbsp; What a pathetic existence!&nbsp; 

""Music and Lyrics"" was just meh as far as romantic comedies go, I wouldn't waste the $6.&nbsp; 



Any volunteers to come to New Mexico to hug me?&nbsp; Pretty please?"

"event","So... as anticipated Albuquerque is amazing.  The people are nice, the food is great, my roommate is one kick-ass chica, the snow is still deep... WAIT, the SNOW?!?  Yes, there are still about four inches of snow left from the huge, record-setting, completely bizarre snow storm New Year's weekend.  Everyone assures me it is completely unheard of, so I fear not about my location choice to get away from snow.  Beside that, everyone has left up their Christmas lights and it was nice to see lights with snow this year, since MI couldn't seem to provide that view.  The mountains here look gorgeous with snow on them, anyway.  

When going into a restaurant or store down here it is like entering the twilight zone.  The people are so nice and helpful all of the time!  They offer recipes, suggest things to add to meals to make them 'nummier; I haven't been in a check-out line yet without someone striking up a conversation.  

Only thing I've had difficulty with is adjusting to the time zone.  I wake up at 6:30-7 and go to bed at about 9.  I feel like such an old woman in this new and different mountain time.  It will probably be good for when I get a job, though!  Eating has been affected, too.  If I eat lunch late it feels as if that was dinner and then when dinner time rolls around I'm not hungry anymore.  I can't wait until I get normalized and start eating us out of house and home.  (Kelli thinks I eat like a bird... if only she knew!)

Dogs!  So high maintenance.  I've never lived with dogs before.  They're ALWAYS there when you turn around, follow you everywhere, and are completely dependent upon you.  It's like I have two kids now.  With Mimi, I could give her food every couple of days, clean her cat-box out twice a week and be done with it and she'd still love on me and cuddle.  But these dogs... it's going to take a bit of getting used to.  Okay, a lot of getting used to.  On third thought, I may never get used to it.

I'm expecting my mother to send me pictures that she took while she was down here (she stayed three days).  I'll put them up on Facebook so everyone can see the house and the view.  

Phone number is still 248-770-8729 for now."

  NEW MEXICO!  Oh my gosh, New Mexico.  I will end up there in some way, shape or form.  I have to, there is no other acceptable way of life.  My five day holiday down there proved to be just what the doctor ordered and really clear-cut a path through the haze for me.  65 degrees and not a cloud in the sky >>>>>>>>>> snowing in Michigan.

  I stayed with someone I met through WoW (gasp) and she turned out to be an older, more financially stable version of myself.  We have the same hair style and colour, the same weight issues, the same need for speed, and the same nerdy glasses.  We spent the entire time listening to musical soundtracks and dancing through various artsy craftsy stores contemplating what our next projects should be.  She introduced me to world renowned artists as if they had played in sand boxes together as children and explained to me how she was going to weld, woodwork, and sandblast her latest piece of furniture and keep the finished bed for herself.  Anyway, really what the point is here, she turned on this switch in my head that said, ""Hey!  These are exactly the things you want to be doing in your free time!!!""  Now it's just a matter of making it happen.

Random bits from the trip:  
My flight from Atlanta to Albuquerque lost power and we had to make an emergency landing in Dallas.  That was fun and caused my arrival to be six hours late.  (With the two hour time difference, landing at midnight caused me to be a complete zombie.)  
I now want a dog, her two were such dolls.  
Santa Fe is possibly the COOLEST place on Earth, however I would not want to live there.  
Big game hunters rock, I don't know if I can live without elk meat fajitas or sword fish now.  
The speed limit is 75 but if you go 85 past a cop they don't care.  
Looking at other womens' breasts is a fun way to pass time.  
There needs to be a sushi bar in Ortonville.  
Isuzus are apparently the vehicles of choice in the lesbian community.  (""No no, I assure you, I like the cock!"")
Nob Hill has the world's COOLEST shops; The A-Store is the only place I will ever consider purchasing furniture and home decor from again.  
ABQ has all of the perks of a big city but never once felt like Chicago, New York, Seattle, etc.  It was clean, attractive, and very friendly.  
My quest to see a prostitute live and in colour still has not been completed.  
RENT rocks.  
Biorb fish aquariums are the coolest thing since sliced bread.  
Playing WoW sitting next to someone is very fun.  
Southern hospitality does exist.  
The rumours of lesbian love are sadly not true, but we did have far too much fun with some of her art:
<img src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y184/GillianAndersonROX/abq3.jpg"" />



THe moral of the story is that I will be going to ABQ soon.  Not sure when, but I promise it will happen.  If you ever want a trip to some place that is gorgeous, easy to get around, cheap and way way fun, look up New Mexico."

"event","I went to Toronto for the weekend and WOW was it ever fun!  Street Fest was Sat/Sun, and the Festival of Fire ended for Canada Day and they had some incredible fireworks.  It was also amazing to be in a big city for the end of the World Cup.  There were fights on the streets between people from each team's faction and all of the bars and restaurants were packed with rowdy fans.  Every time anything happened in the game it was as if the entire city cried out.  Shopping was great and so were the people.  I saw Pirates there with some Canadian friends and really wasn't all that impressed; it was really too cheesy for my tastes, although entertaining.  

  I've been studying like a madman for the ultrasound physics boards.  They changed the criteria just in time for me to have to go back and redo all preparations I had already made.  I'm not amused.

 Scott's birthday was yesterday.  He was upset that I had seen Pirates without him.  Oh well.  He'd best not complain about all of the things we did instead.

"event","First let me start off by saying happy birthday to Amanda!  I hope you're not too horribly incapacitated right this second... ;)  I enjoyed our lunch together Friday.

Secondly, Wicked was awesome.  If you ever get the chance do go see it!  

Third, I work for bitches.  All of my partners quit this week and I think I'm going to follow.  (Metro Family Physicians, the private office, not the hospital.)

I saw my aunt for the first time in roughly five years this past weekend and it is funny how really similar I am to all of the females on my mother's side of the family.  I rarely see them, yet we're like five identical personalities, not to mention we all have essentially the same laugh.  It really makes me want to spend more time with them; too bad my aunt is returning to Seattle Friday.  

Also, my mum got us tickets to see Celtic Woman in July!  I'm very excited.  Two days after I get back from Toronto (which should be a blast!  Jim is going and so is his GF).  Brother's open house is also at the end of July!  It should be a fun month."

"event","My brother graduated yesterday; I'm still not quite sure how to feel about it.  He shouldn't be this old yet, I mean, he's my baby brother.  Little Al is little no more.

  Confirmation that my step sister's baby is indeed a boy.  I didn't fail at something, hurray.  She's half way there!

  Scott is taking me to X-Men tomorrow afternoon and I am overjoyed!  

  I'm putting serious thought into moving to Albuquerque.  It's an awesome place and has my ideal climate.  No grass to cut, no snow to shovel... sunshine and a workplace close by, not to mention it is gorgeous.  Mmmmmmmmm... Albuquerque."

"event","Jim, my step brother, has been meeting up with Allie, a girl he met from our Warcraft guild, each weekend.  They're offically and ""item"" now.  Great for them.  She's from Wisconsin, going to school in Chicago currently.  She's coming up again this weekend and coming to meet the 'fam on Sunday.  That should prove quite interesting with ten people over for dinner with the evil step mother cooking.  It will be nice to meet her, though; TeamSpeak doesn't do people justice.

  Hannah, my step sister, is 17 weeks PREGNANT!  She came into work on Thursday and I took a little peek into her belly.  She was so excited!  (She came in a few weeks back when it was still the size of a peanut.)  Imagine her surprise when now it has arms and legs and is essentially just a mini baby there on the screen!  It felt great to be a part of her, Zack, and her mother's moment of pure joy.  Oh, by the way, IT'S A BOY!


  And I'm never telling anyone my age again.  Why the hell does it matter that I'm ten years younger than you think I should be?  I'm here, aren't I?  I'm doing my job.  I'm taking care of business in my life.  Granted I feel like I'm five years older than I am, what the hell is age but a number?  Judge me some more, assholes.  (End bitterness.)"

"event","Down go the mighty Red Wings.  There go my plans for every other night for the next month.  It's always too good to be true with them.  I guess it is time to start watching basketball... yuck.

  I got called in last night and thus got two hours of sleep, but for whatever reason I'm not tired.  I guess I'm getting used to it like they told me I would.  Getting used to being disgustingly sleep deprived... yuck.

  I've got four different instances of call this week and I'm working the night shift for my partner who is having surgery.  I've stressed myself into a minor sinusy cold thing because of it... yuck.

  Scott is going to take even longer getting through school because he hasn't gotten all As and likely won't be accepted to pharm programs.  This means my life has to be essentially on hold even longer... yuck.


  
  I'm lonely... yuck."

"event","My cousin Sandra got married on Saturday in the most beautiful setting I've ever seen.  (Ann Arbor Botanical Gardens with a lone cello followed by reception at a polo club.)  She was the very picture of radiance.  Her father, my beloved uncle, looked exceptionally well with all things considered.  His progess down the aisle at her arm was noticeably slowed but he was full of composure.  

  At the reception he gave a tender, touching toast to the new couple and smiled elegantly.  He was overheard to say, ""I can't dance"" but my aunt was at his side with the unwavering support she has always been known for and in her unmistakable Puerto Rican accent said, ""Well, you'd better get ready!""  






There was not a dry eye in the building when he danced with Sandra.  I'm sure my aunt, sitting alone at her table, had the most private of moments of reflection and love.  Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"" was the perfect song choice.

I'd like to think Sandra will remember those few precious moments, dancing with her ailing father, the rest of her life."

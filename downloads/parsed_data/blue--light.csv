You're warm, and the most approachable. You have<br>that gentle prescence about you. People can<br>relate to you, and find you easy company.<br>However it's likely you've been hurt in the<br>past and it has left you scarred so things can<br>become rather chilly with you at times. Being<br>the third Season in, you're mature, trustworthy<br>and loyal to your friends but prone to<br>depression and negative thinking.

Well done... You're the shy and sensitive season :)

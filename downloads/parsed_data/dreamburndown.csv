"event","Well, i know i said everything was good, and in reality it has been. I took many steps towards rectifying problems with my physical self, IE.. quitting smoking, gave up my car for my bike, and quit numerous other negative behaviors. I have never really felt better physically, it is just that mental aspect that seems to be consuming me. I hoped that in my efforts to make my physical being better, that my head would just come with it. But to be honest nothing seems to make my head come around, i am still anxious and confused most of the time, and women don't really help with that either"

"event","well i can't even remember how long its been since i wrote in this thing. It has probably been long enough that people who would want to snoop into my life have since abandoned my live journal. so i am from now on safe until they catch back on. Life has been interesting since i last posted, most of it came with a change of location in the city and a change of lifestyle. I moved to Bloomfield with Jake, Alex, and now Brian Boyle, so quite the NWPA house we have going for ourselves. As for the lifestyle change, don't worry i am still straight, whole foods couldn't change that but it did make me a bike person, yeah! so a lot of people who have known me for many years will look at this and think i have changed, but fear not i am still the same sarcastic scared little boy that you all know and love. I am still fish mongering and single, funny how they correspond but to be honest the single part never changes but now i have an excuse to smell horrible. There was also another failed attempt at college in there somewhere, but it is hardly worth mentioning. I have never thought i would live a conventional life anyways so the college failures aren't bothering me too much. That whole""go to college, graduate, meet a girl, get married,get a real job, and have children"" thing was never for me. Well back to the fish! my breaks never last long enough, but hopefully I'll start writing more."

"event","well lets see, i haven't updated for about 25 weeks which is a long long long time. About a month ago, i decided that i needed change. so on a whim, i applied to new jobs, and colleges. So as of last month, i started working at whole foods. Which for those who don't know is an organic grocery store filled with overly tattooed and ridiculous people. The workplace is ridiculously positive, and earth conscious. It pays far better than staples ever did, and i don't have quota's to reach for sales and there is no stress involving fixing computers. Whole foods has been going really well all the people i work with in the Seafood department are really likable and easy to get along with. Also, i applied to Pitt, and honestly i believed i really had no chance of getting in, but somehow personal essay willing i got in, and will be starting classes in the fall. I have not decided whether or not it will be full-time or part-time yet, but that is all dependent upon whole foods giving me a close to set schedule so that i can schedule classes. most likely going to study history at Pitt, in hopes of eventually turning my shit around and possibly going to law school. I am still in Dormont currently, which needs to change soon, because the commute to work is quite obnoxiously long, about an hour during high traffic times and anywhere from 20-30 minutes any other time. So Jacob and i are currently looking for apartments in the Bloomfield, Lawrenceville,or friendship areas in Pittsburgh. hopefully we will get on top of that soon, because thats probably the most pressing change i need. I got a new cell phone and number, if you need it let me know and i ll send it your way. Also, i am most likely getting a new car shortly too, not new but better than the old green car that i was driving before hand and hopefully nicer than the baby blue old school hip hop car i am currently driving. 
well thats all for now"

"event","Well, i am finally recovered from being sick. its nice to feel like myself again, but there is a part of me that is miserable. I can't really explain it, it is just this deep seated uneasiness. Everything is fine in pittsburgh, i wish my social situation was better but i knew that it was going to be a difficult adjustment. i have good friends out here, but they are all so busy and have their own lives which i am for most part not involved with. And as i sit here on a night that i'd usually be surrounded by a bunch of my friends, i think about my night where i hungout with only one. The more and more i think about it, i want to call my friends in philly and tell them how much i miss them. how i miss just having someone to sit around and be an asshole with or my regularly scheduled hangouts with certain people or groups of people. i knew this wasnt going to be easy, and i know calling my friends will just make me miss them more. philly still has a hold of me right now, i havent been able to release myself from its sirens call. but it is not like i want to forget it or how the people made me feel, i just want a little taste of that here. but that takes proactiveness and not living in the past, so i got to move forward and make sure not to forget the past and the things i have learned."

"event","well, i am still sort of sick. and i have kind of this general malaise that is making me feel shitty. i really like that the rest of my life is sorted out, but still the same problem keeps attaching to me. and i see everybody around me, mostly my best friends all being in the same situations, they are either considering marriage or breaking off the longest relationships of their lives. But then there is tim, i dont know if i am the least attractive of the bunch or if i am just the most fucked up. i dont think i am either, but all i do know is that it just isnt happening at all. i dont even get excited about the prospect of it anymore, it just has almost left my mind as being in the realm of possibility. and unlike philly, i dont feel that pittsburgh is a place that is full of possibilities. i dont know whats going to happen, i am just going to keep on doing what i am doing and hope that something will change. all i know is i need something to get this bitter taste out of my mouth."

"event","well, lets see being in pittsburgh has been fun besides the constant sickness. But beyond that i have been getting along really well with my sister and bro-in-law, and benjamin has really taken to me. Mostly all he does is laugh at me and laugh at how everybody says he looks exactly like me. The job search has been pretty much null and void because of me being sick and spending time in the hospital with the kathryn and the baby. Being sick has for some reason gotten me into a really creative mood and i have started plotting out another long story to write. i havent really  partaken in a big writing project since before i moved to philly, that one reached about 70 pages single spaced in word. but it was lost during the great reformmating disaster of '02. but i have been plotting out the story, it will as has everything i have ever written be loosely based on my life. and i feel i have plenty fuel in the tank to write another story about failure and rejection, as i have become quite used to those things during my time in philadelphia. i am thinking of calling it,I-80 or I-76. either would work, i actually had the idea to start writing about the last couple of years during the drive to pittsburgh (on I-80) after the move from philly. My mom asked me,""So tim, what did you learn from all this, you know the last three years?"", my reply was simple enough,""do you want me to write you a book?"" so after a long conversation with my mother and father about how they were pleased that i had come to a point where i could make decision on my situation and actually try and be proactive. my mother termed it as a ""graduation"" to responsibility, i just thought of it as a lesson."

"event","well, i went out to west philly tonight, so that i would feel like one of my last saturday nights in philadelphia wasnt a complete waste. i still had an alright time, i got to see people and thats always alright. but then my drunk ass decided to walk home, i am piss poor right now. so i had to make a choice, either wait for the bus or walk, so i walked and i was going to take the bus when it came by. well it didnt, or it might have gone by when i was pissing in some dark alleyway. but either way, i did a lot of walking, which really wasnt that bad, considering i have a shit ton of things on my mind. so i walked. i love doing thing like that in a  drunken haze, something that you know you are going to regret tommorow but do anyways because you can. so i walked and thought about shit. i have been thinking about how i am feeling about this whole move. i am really looking forward to it as a new start somewhere that i am comfortable, but i also find it strangely amusing that i have met people in the last couple of months that i really like and how it must just be another obstacle for me to overcome. but in all reality i am not a fatalistic person, i dont really think that anything happens for a reason, but i might have subconsciously built these people up as an excuse not to leave and as a reason for letting things stay the same. but i dont know i am pretty sure i geniunely like them, all i do know is that i am going to go live in my sisters basement,and help her and Sonny and their crazy schedule and they are going to help me with my problems. so i really cant see a downside."

this isnt per say a new phenomena for myself, and probably not for most nice guys that exist. but it gets to be something that is unavoidable. i am not going to try to be different with girls, if a girl doesnt like me how i am that is fine with me. my problem is being strung along, this has happened to me many times. if i like someone, i tell them. and almost every guy who just read that, realize how stupid that is. automatically any pull you would in the game is immediately gone, and you are left to either be one of two things, never talked to again or strung along. i usually get the latter, it must be because i am way too nice. why not have somebody doing things for you? or having someone look out for you? or even better getting you drunk? but how come it is a glass case, and instead of a lock box? well i'd like to think that someday one of these girl will  realize that just because they have the power to stow me away and string me along, that the also have the ability to have me in general without debasing me."

I wish the answer was the latter of the two so that i could convince myself to stop thinking, but alas i cant and probably for the better. i d rather be an emotionally fucked up person than a dumb one, i say that again but as i do, i dont know if i agree with it. while i was home for thanksgiving i had a ton of conversations with my parents about my motivation, my mindset, and my life plan. and it really got me to thinking about the problems that have plagued me the most and they are for the most part not delegated to my intellect,but rather with the my emotions and motivation. i am really concerned that in a large part i am a rather un-emotional person, i came to understand at a young age that being emotional in my family only leads to trouble, so i spent my time trying to be overly rational and deal things only through my intellect and try and overcome what emotions i had. this was pretty difficult for myself, and led to me training myself not to feel really. and it seems to me that this gap between my intellect and emotions is what has led to my current problems. the extreme difference in levels between the both has led me to believe that, my over-analytical nature has robbed me of knowing how to deal with things i can not rationalize. but eh, it could just be that i finished reading all the nietzsche i could read and all the smiths i could listen to by the time i was 16."

"event","Yesterday, Ryan Bird and I went to see the american analog set with headphones down at the khyber. I was a little cautious about spending the money, since i am uber broke, but i did anyways and it turned out to be well worth the price of admissions. So ryan and i headed down to penn's landing early so we could catch the happy hour at the khyber, and succeeded in drink a couple beers before the bands began to play. The first band was pathetic, i have never heard a lead singer try harder to sound like he was british, but musically they werent bad. Then headphones came on, and i dont know how many times i am going to have to listen to synth based emo/pop garbage, but during their set, i looked over to my left and made a comment to ryan that there was a guy that looked an awful lot like Horatio Sanz. And ryan completely agreed, but upon further inspection, he didnt just look like Horatio Sanz, he was Horatio Sanz, and he was walking right towards ryan and i. I was going to ask him if he was indeed the only fat man cast member of saturday nite live that hadnt died of a drug overdose, but i froze up. And as he walked by Ryan, said ""are you horatio sanz"" and before he could answer i stuck my hand out and said i was a big fan. hahha, even though i find his and jimmy falons incessant laughing during their skits to be a little annoying. So after that ryan and i were dumbstruck, what was horatio sanz doing at a show in philly? and an indie rock show as a matter of fact. We saw other people wondering if it was truly him and one couple said they actually asked to see his i.d and he obliged. So we saw him watch a little bit of American Analog Set, which were amazing as usual, and then he disappeared like a fat guy at a swimming pool. SO anyways now i have a new found appreciation for Horatio Sanz, not only is he a fat guy but he likes the American Analog Set."

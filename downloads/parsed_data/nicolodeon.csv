"event","sometimes i get words or phrases stuck in my head for days at a time for no apparent reason. last week was ""we're gonna have ALL the sex"", a not so famous quote from chandler.

the week before was ""ampersand"". i don't know why, but i liked the way it sounded. also, i kept randomly hearing one-two step. made me wanna line dance. 

anyway, this week it's ""stranger danger! bad touch! bad touch!!"". i don't know why, but when over used in the wrong context, this makes me laugh, like, so hard. whatev. stay tuned for next week's nonsequitor subliminal word enigma.

i leave you with this:

""last night, i dreamt of glocca morra, again... it's really a shame you can't publish a sentence. i'm convinced it would be a best seller.""

"event","so it's 430 and i should be doing the rest of my homework. but my mind is going about 1000 miles an hour, which is faster than i can keep up with, so naturally, i am distracting myself from the force of thoughts. but theres been one eating away at me lately. that's making me feel even worse than i usually do... ok theres two. 

1) i am trying to practice christianity again. theres just one problem: i can't seem to locate christ. i could sure use a hand. i know he's there. or something is. just never quite when i seem to need someone the most. at any rate, i'm trying to practice what the guy preached. and i've been judging myself every step of the way. for those of you who think i don't like you or care anymore, i do. but i just can't be around people right now. i'm sorry. i hope you understand.

2) the one person i can be around has been letting me down the most. and no, i'm not talking about myself. you know who you are. i hope. 

i'm getting really tired of dreaming about the way things should go. and i'm getting tired of waiting for a change. i don't know what else to do. hiding out perhaps isn't the best thing i could be doing, but at least it's keeping me from talking to people... anyway... i guess i got what i wanted... a blessing and a burden. 

but i just wanted everyone to know that i'm constantly thinking about you all. but picking up a phone and calling sounds a lot easier than it actually is.

i have so much to be thankful for, and i am, but i can't shake this treacherous hollow... i know i'll be fine tomorrow."

ok, so i keep realizing these things. things that are kind of important. things that should matter, and initially mold me in the long run. but i can't quite catch the grip of them. 

recently, i noticed [and accepted] the fact that i'm scatterbrained. i just never really expected it to pull me in so many directions, and bring down others alongside myself in the process.

i wish things were easier. but they aren't. and they can't be. because when people get emo, they're the only ones who exist in an entire galaxy. end of story. 

i'm sorry. slowly, i'm learning.  

but before i'm through, i'd just like to invite you to imagine the atmosphere created for me when things become flawed for you. try to dream it up next time.

you can't please them all. there's just no allegiance anymore.

"event","my past five days:

friday:

- have this epiphany that i'll never get ahead, no matter how far there i feel i am
- tired from crying the past few days
- cry some more
- go to work, serve my time
- get off, go to shannon's for some drinking and a bbq
- can't quite seem to put my finger on it, but i feel very antisocial
- eventually go home, and cry myself to sleep 

saturday:

- get up early
- run some errands
- go to dad's house
- have a fun party with the family
- have a small nervous breakdown when everyone leaves
- dad corners me, step mom makes me talk by blocking the door and refusing to let me leave the house. 
- i finally talk and realize whats been killing me
- they console me and profoundly encourage me to move in with them, to help out a bit
- i am considering it
- i leave and go home around 11:30/ 12 at night
- go to sleep around 1 only to bring me to:

sunday:

- get up at 6 to be at work by 7 to do floor moves and be done by 11...
- floor moves drain my energy, plus i am already cranky from lack of sleep and tons of crying over the past week
- finish the damn moves around 2, 3 hours later than what should have been
- go home at 4
- cry a crapload more (?)
- cousin calls, depressed, wants to go walking
- i agree, i feel the same way
- we walk 4 miles
- my feet hurt

monday:
- wake up early to call the poll people
- get prepped for them
- clean the shit outta my room (if anyone wants stuff, lemme know, i'm throwin away most of it)
- go to work in the afternoon, to find that the floor move was ""good""... ""BUT""....
- fixed the damn floor move
- took me my entire shift 
- (lily brought me a slurpee, sunkist(: )
- go home after work, around 10 
- get to sleep around 1:30 (notice theres a pattern- i can only sleep when i don't want to)
- which brings me to:

tuesday:
- wake up at 4:30
- get showered/ dressed/ coffee
- get to polls at 6 a.m.
- sit there, bored as hell, for hours, listening to old people bitch
- so stiff, aching from walking and work
- finally get to leave at like 9-ish
- go home with a headache
- vent to a few people (sorry, and thanks if you're one of them!)
- go to sleep

wednesday:
- wake up at 7:30
- get ready
- go to my sister's school to go on a field trip with her class
- we walk to the park, where we spend the day
- i get sun-burnt, and a horrible migraine
- (this one was worth it, cause i spent it with my sister!)
- stiff and sore still, need a massage
- go meet ape right after to go tanning
- we end up going through some keepsake things, and tossing out all sorts of crap
- eventually go tanning, i am sunburnt, probably not a great idea
- go to work, do all sorts of crap
- still have a headache, though not as bad as it was
- go to a bonfire, where i freeze my ass off
- get put on the spot, and made to feel uncomfortable *thanks a lot, casanova!*
- really just wanna come home and go to sleep, but can't

now it's 1 a.m. i'm so cried out. i just want to sleep. i want a massage. no, i need both. 

goodnight!"

soooooooo boring, easiest $100 i've ever made. thats pretty much it!

oh, and i wasn't the only young person there. there was this other dude my age. it's nice to know that some people in my generation care about voting and encouraging others to vote.

anyone who reads this and is over 18 and DID NOT vote, you should know, i'm very upset with you. but i'll be over it by tomorrow.

today, everything was fine fine fine  
until roundabout quarter to 9, 
suddenly I found myself in a bind,a bind  
was it something i said?  
something i read and manifested 
that's getting you down?  
don't you dare come to bed with that ambiguous look in your eye 
i'd sooner sleep by an open fire and wake up fried  

say what you will  
say what you mean  
no, you could never offend  
your dirty words come out clean  

tomorrow, what price will i pay?  
could i make it all up to you by serving coffee for two in bed,
would you then give me the time of day?

i need a map of your head, 
translated into english so i can learn 
to not make you frown  
feel better if you vent, 
put your frustrations into four letter words 
and let them out on mine  
the most weathered ears in town!  
say what you will  
say what you mean  
no, you could never offend  
your dirty words come out clean  

clean

It's a faint, a brief affinity 
It's a touch when it shouldn't be

Now a crash but it's just physical 
Not a point, except it's natural

It's the thought that gets lost in time

"event","wow... so last night i had this dream that squirrels attacked me.

it was weird. me and john and gina all went to the same university in which we had a class together held outdoors in an enormous ampitheatre.  the walk to the ampitheatre is very scenic and peacful, up until you get to the part where crazy ass squirrels start to attack. on the way to class one day, we are walking up the stairs in the forrest. there are at least 30 people surrounding us.  we get stuck on the stairs right next to the eccentric squirrels, and we try to leave to get around to the other side where there is another entrance.  the fucking squirrels start hurling grapefruit sized pine cones and whatnot at other students and passersby. john gets hit in the head by a pinecone and just runs away confused.

i jump in and start trying to fight the squirrels off, but i slip in some mud and fall on my face.  then, one of the little f'ers  craps on me, and it all goes down the back of my shirt. then i get up, furious and ready to attack, and the bitch craps on my face.

then i wake up, extremely confused, and stumble into the shower.

i just don't even know. i've been having some bizarre dreams lately, but so far this one takes the cake.

maybe it was a result of yesterday's ghosthunter's marathon. except there were no squirrels.

Of everything but you

And I'll wait here and sometimes I get one

Outside waiting in the cold
Kiss me once in the snow
I swear it never gets old
And I will promise you I can make it warmer next year
You know I came here

"event","religion is a disease. it needs to be broken down. 

it is a sickness that only fellow members could understand. it is a death warrant for anyone who betrays it. it is frightening and habitual,  and people should be tested before practicing.  

please understand, i am not knocking anyone in particular. but too much of anything can be poisonous. 


<lj-cut text=""more"">-everything needs a balance... which means for all the good something brings, there is a bad counterpart somewhere in the world.  which, more and more often, within the politics of many churches, i find a balance within itself.

-religion was meant as a guidelines for life, not as a an entirely alternate way of living.  over a course of thousands of years, people have adjusted the rules from a human state of nature to having boundaries, and then adjusting them here and there when necessary.  sin is a human characteristic. i sin, and i am not ashamed. fuck you.

-when someone is so caught up in their religion that they disregard loved ones and make their lives miserable, then the religion probably is only there to fill the void of emptiness. yes, we know, God...or the universe.. or the great spirit.. whatever you call it...can fill the void. but you need to find it in you, and you need to embrace and accept it. sitting in a room with a bunch of other brainwashed participants isn't getting close to God, it's killing time on a sunday morning, or falling into a routine. 

- people who love their religion/ beliefs so much, i highly encourage you to talk about them, share them with me.  but for fuck's sake, DO NOT preach to me about how i need to come back to the lord, or God has decided i'm going to hell. fuck you.

there are at least 50 different grievances i have against any forced or fake practiced religion. i only mentioned these b/c recently, regretful to say, a friend of a co-worker committed suicide. while all of the late kid's friends and relatives sat around and mourned his death, reminisced, and searched inside for answers to the overall meaning of life, and how little it's valued, his mother (a hard core pentecostal) decided that it was ""God's will"" for him to have killed himself, and since he committed the most heinous of all sins, she would much rather dump his body off a cliff and let it rot. 

what is wrong with people? why can't we all just accept one another's beliefs and respect them? i was raised by a born again christian, who can't accept the fact that i don't agree. it's a struggle everyday of my life, because each and everytime i try to venture out of this stupid little box, a little voice in the back of my head mockingly tells me that God is judging me, and that i am gonna go to hell.

i'm not even sure if i believe in God, but i am for damn sure scared shitless that there is one, and that i will be judged and tortured. and then i often think about how depressed i was for all those years, and how i have been getting lately, and i think that there literally could be nothing worse than that overwhelming feeling, that swallows you whole, lets you soak in it's stomach acids, but doesn't digest you until you've done yourself in.  and i try to picture hell being even worse than that. but i can't. which leads me to think that i was a horrible person in some other world, and i am paying for it here and now.  or maybe this is purgatory, and God is weighing out my past life's good and bad for the time being.

all i know is that once, after literally thinking i was gonna die, all i could think was 'God/ Jesus is back... he's gonna judge me...'

why the hell should i have to live my life like that? in constant fear of pissing off the afterlife? 
i don't even know what happens there. i don't think i want to.

anyway, religion, when over-analyzed (whether positively or negatively)is a disease. it feeds on you mentally until you parish and wither away. it sucks when enjoying life becomes a chore.</lj-cut>"

4) Never discuss it again.


1)i used to look up to you, but now i think you're selfish and lazy, and very shameful to your family. 

2) you have the potential of a galaxy, and i don't want you to throw it all away.

3) if i could, i would take it all away, and you would have never experienced any of it, even though i despised you at the time.

4) i'm only attracted to you 45% of the time. the other 55% i think you're insane. and i wish it weren't like that.

5) the main reason i'm in school is because i don't want to be like you.

6) it sickens me the way you cater to his every move. he's only with you cause you give it up. please stop talking about him!

7) i loved you, then. i'd still now. i hope you're happy in another place.

8) i don't think you're problems are more important than mine, and nor do i believe they're as big a deal as you make them. i've been there. i know. STFU.

9) fuck you, don't cloud up my good mood ever again.

10) you're no longer welcome here. my duties to you as a friend have been severed.

11) i hate you, and the way you made me feel with him. fuck you.

12) i hope you learn before it's too late.

13) i really think you're annoying, so please stay the fuck away from me.
 
14) if you were to die, i'd REALLY miss your room. 

15) i wish there was more of you to go around :P

16) tell me again... why did we never date?!?

17) i thought i loved you, but it was just a brain hemmorhage.

18) i'd do you in a second.

19) and you.

20) i only pretend to care."

i love my uncles. they're the glue in the family.  i love my family. we are a zoo.

yesterday wasn't so terrible once i slept and cooled off.  plus, watching 'fear and loathing' made me laugh a little. i fucking love that movie. it always makes me laugh.

"event","good day

so you dont want to hear about my good song?
and you dont want to hear about how i am getting on
with all the things that i can get done
the sun is in the sky & i am by my lonesome
so you don't want to hear about my good day?
you have better things to do than to hear me say

god its been a lovely day! everything is going my way
i took out the trash today and i'm on fire...

so you don't want to hear about my good friends?
you dont have the guts to take the truth or consequence
success is in the eye of the beholder
and its looking even better over your cold shoulder

i'm not suggesting you up and line me up for questioning
but jesus think about the bridges you are burning
and i'm betting
that even though you knew it from the start
you'd rather be a bitch than be an ordinary broken heart

so go ahead and talk about your bad day...
i want all the details of the pain and misery
that you are inflicting on the others
i consider them my sisters and i'd like their numbers

god its been a lovely day! everything is going my way
i took up croquet today and i'm on fire

i picked up the pieces of my broken ego
i have finally made my peace as far as you and me go
but i'd love to have you up to see the place
& i'd like to do more than survive i'd like to rub it in your face.....

hey! its been a lovely day! everything is going my way
i had so much fun today and i'm on fire
god it's been a lovely day everything's been going my way
ever since you went away hey i'm on fire.....
i'm on fire...
i'm on fire...
so you dont want to hear about my good day?"

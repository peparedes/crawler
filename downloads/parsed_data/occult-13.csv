"event","Omg I have so much to say. On friday after school I went to regina for a romanian reunion all weekend. It was so awesome.  Me and Romona, and Danny, and Pj, and Kellen, and Sarah, and Sanda, and Florin, and Tibi, and Shanna, hung out all weekenend. This journal might be long but its so worth it cause i dont want to forget anything. Friday night we got there and had supper at the hotel and met up with everyone and went swimming. I met a bunch of people I forgot about like Tibi and Shanna, and I met Sarah for the first time. And some other people there too. The next day we woke up early and swam, had lunch and swam more. That night we went out for supper it was so awesome cause I had a long conversation with Tibi. Man I always used to think that kid was  a jackass but I was so wrong. I love that kid like a 2 dollar whore :P hahah hes super awesome though I had some good conversations with him. Then after supper we went back to the hotel and went swimming more, and then me and tibi went for a walk around the hotel and then everyone came too and we hung out in the lobby OH YEAH :P Then Tibi and Shanna left so me and mona and pj and danny and kellen hung out. We orded pizza to our hotel room and it cost 55 bucks! And it wasnt that great of pizza either. Speaking of pizza you should seen the pizza whore MY GOD WHAT A SLUT!.. would you like me? or the pizza? perhaps both? hahahahaha. Anywho, so me and mona and danny hung out n watch Saturday night live. It was the best skits ever. They had Debbie Downer, and this guy who went for his GME and failed like everything he did. And in one they made fun of harry potter, and the other one they had this crazy guy driving. Oh man there are so many details im leaving out but my hands are getting sore from typing. SO that is all for now."

"event","<STRONG><EM><FONT color=#33ff33>Well let me tell you all a story about tonight, it was crazy insane. We went to mitch's house for&nbsp; a little "" get together"". Okay first of all let me say that ways of being comfortable may look perverted. hahahah. Oh yeah, ask Leanne , Kyle, Mike, or Mitch how that works they might be glad to tell you hahaha.&nbsp; Okay what else happend at Mitchs, first thing Mitch that women beater, like slapped me or punched me in the face or something and he hit my lip and it started bleeding, its currently bloody and puffy, yay! Second thing that happened was well, back up a sec. Mitch is re-doing the outside of his house so he has a dumpster to put all the old shingels and shit. So whatever I see then dumpster and start freaking out cause Mitch has his own personal dumpster... like in his driver, cmon people thats just wiked. So I though I'd be funny and climb into it, so I put my hands up and a nail from a board or something in there, went into my hand. So then i went to mitchs bathroom cause my hand was all bloody and yeah. So we looked for his peroxide and i was freaking out cause I didnt want to put on myself cause it hurts. So Kyle being the nice kid does it for me, oh thats good idea.... So he's like okay I'll just dump the lid on so he does, then hes like oh it need more so he like soaks my fucking hand in it, and im standing there like screaming and he starts laughing.. pah. Well whatever i was holding onto his arm the whole time so I hope he gets like a big ass bruise that would great. But yeah thats all for now. My hand hurts like a bitch and so does my lip. I'm going camping this long weekend so yeah.. thats all.</FONT></EM></STRONG>"

I was going 85 yay thats fast for me :D hahaha. Today was pretty cool though, it went by really fast, it was actually hot outside, and Ryan bought me a slushie. Thanks Ryan hahaha.</EM> <EM>Umm what else can I say, Oh last night I for 3 and half hours, haha, and I'm still only 1/4 through the book hahaha. Im not that slow.. its a long book! It called "" The Celestine Prophecy"" it's WIKED good!! I'm addicted to it right now, its craziness I say. It's a fictional story about a guy who goes hunting for a manuscript and has to experience all these insights, it's hard to explain you'd have to read it, but it really changed how you look at life big time, its awesome. What else can i say here...uhm.. Oh, well I started listening to Otep the other day(a band just so yeah know) and they're really good from what I've heard so far, I've only heard like 4 of their songs, and I don't have anything to download music on(BUH!) so yeah i can't really get anymore, but i'll keep searching. Their amazing from what I've heard, I advise you to check them out, its worth it.&nbsp; And I found this really cool website for the resident evil movie and it has the soundtrack you can listen too, pretty fucking good if you ask me. Here's the link go and have a listen.&nbsp;</EM></FONT></P>

"event","synopsis...
not sure when i wrote last.  halloween was awesome.  went to the castro with barry.  didn't meet up with sabina and harish, but saw superbooty.  good stuff.  had an incredible time.  saw king's x last tuesday.  again, had an awesome time.  can't believe i loved a prog rock show, but i believe it is a good thing.  michael came home for a few days.  great to see him.  he got me tanked.  had a blast.  didn't puke.  got bad news today.  something truly horrible happened yesterday.  i managed to forget about it with the help of a couple of friends and triple rock.  simpsons centered on theme that brought it back.  must drink more.  never wanting to be a parent is stronger than it has been in a while.  too saddened to cry.  fuck."

"event","something new...  is always good.  so this is really silly 'cause the people who might read this already know every freaking detail of my day.  however, this is what all the kids are doing, so here i go...
have had a great day.  did it on no sleep even.  slept through my alarm clock (or something...)  and still made it to work early.  good work day.  no assholes, boss in a decent mood, only non-stressful coworkers.  yoga and sushi date with elizabeth was quite nice.  fed frankie my very own crickets (is this living or what?)  watched simpsons.  talked with joseph on his birthday, which was really good.  miss him a bit.  talked to mike from salt lake/denver.  been playing phone tag for a month now, so actually talking to him was extra special.  he is going to come visit for a week in january.  i haven't seen him since we were 17, so there is some catching up to do there.  i am quite excited.  nothing like visits from old friends.  and on my turf this time.  a bit of pressure, but good pressure, like massages that make you wanna scream.  i miss michael.  talked to rhi today.  she isn't able to come for halloween, but will visit sometime soon.  hoping to get time off to make it up to portland for fun.  i hope it works out, although i truly hope michael is home by then.  haven't had time to miss barry yet, but it sure is quiet around here...  i actually have plans for the rest of the week, so that is exciting; stuff to look forward to always helps.  simpsons will be on soon; must be going.  i'll talk to myself again soon."

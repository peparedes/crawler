Then we saw Coheed and Cambria which was hot, Avenge Sevenfold which ripped up nicely with Edward Scissorhands theme my fucking lover, THEN WE SAW ANTIFLAG THAT WAS THE BEST MOTHERFUCKING GREATEST SHOW I EVER SAW THEM PLAY.  Police Brutality was fucking a riot! That song got everyone moshing like crazy no noob ass emo junk could have survived the fucking real pitt going on in this one.  I think I screamed every lyric they played with such passion that if they saw me among the crowd they would have cried.  After that we were starving and we needed food but the wait was 3 hours so we got icecream which was holding us over till we saw TBS which honestly I enjoyed a shit load more at Surf and Skate where there wasn't any white valley hoes everywhere we got stuck in the back so it was horrible.  I had the best mofo time!!!  I will so do that again next summer!"

"event","I don't know why that line came to mind today but it was how I have felt most of my life.  Well anyway I guess this summer was hohum but peaceful at least.  I get a lot more sleep then during the school year and a lot more chill out time with my friends.  In two weeks my bestfriend Paula and I are going to the Rennaissance Fair and raise havok there!! Then I will go to Vans Warped Tour the craziest event this summer so far.  Then my birthday on the 5th of September which is going to be nuts enough.  Six Flags in 4 weeks and my sister's wedding.  So I got a lot going for me.  Next week I might go down the shore with my mom if weather permits and all is pretty much going nicely so far.  I can't wait till school starts though I feel I will be begining a new phase in my life.  Maybe a new man since I have been lonely for a couple of months now, no haste though.  Being single rules because I am at peace with myself and focused on being productive.  I just have one of those feelings like this year it's going to be all new, new friends, new life, new romances maybe, new wishes and hopes.. everything new.  I have a new haircut so I feel new!! I hope everyone is ok that includes you Mark which I never see but I always send you good vibes regardless of what you say.  I don't have evil fairies working for me.  I hope you too Mark have fun and meet new people that can enlighten your path maybe I wasn't cut out for you or you for me, but I am sure they'll be new stuff for you next year you just wait and see.  Well time to take over the world now I got to go.  I think I just had an enlightment I will always be true to myself as well as others.  For now on if I don't like someone I will quit it real fast before I am labled superficial ever again. Thanks Mark for enlightening me sometimes I cease to realize my shortcommings.  Well kiss kiss hope all as bright as it can be."

"event","So far I have been harassed by my stupid ex boyfriends.  It's as if they all have psychic powers and know that I am single and want to be that way and all of a sudden all of them come out of nowhere to darken my peaceful solitude.  I was actually at friggin peace and then they all fucking call.  Steve and fucking the Arab Abadi...? go fig all except Mark... ha ha that one will never call.  Honestly I don't know what to say about him.  He hurt me the most, because I really didn't give him a reason to fucking give me an atittude.  Well..whatever no more emo boys ever again.  Anyways being single rules.  I read a shit more, go to movies with friends, just really chill out, no more stressing on what he* doing , where is he* going and none of that drama.  I guess I finally found out what I was looking for, for sooooooo long.  Peace of mind.  Yesterday my friend MIMI came back from the army but I didn't get to see her sheds a tear... I was at the Meadowlands Fair with my old buddy Paula who rules.  Next year we are going to Spain how exciting is that. She swears I'll meet someone over there..as for me men are out of the picture for a good long time.  I am not ready to date anyone right now.  The truth is I am trying to become a better person. I want to be quiet.  I always try and struggle to try to get deep into a person but the truth is people don't want me digging up in there minds and well.....I got to stop playing psychologist and angel with people I care about.  Sometimes they just want me to be me not some analyzing philosophical weirdo.  Oh well.......can't help to care.  Today I am going to a Cuban Concert YERBA BUENA I am so fucking psyched.  I can't wait to go and fucking have fun with my patria!!! Gosar como loca!!! Cubanita forever.  MAYBE A SCARFACE looking guy will fall in love with Paula she loves fucking Cuban men.  I really don't fall for them but a cute little Scotish guy would be cool........if only they came to Jersey...ha dreaming is good.........well i will be 21 soon......and it's drink up a good whiskey and sing a good song cause you only live once... carpe a diem.......or else you'll die.......and regret it. peace people.....hey norma this shit journal is the for you cause no one reads this anymore .........by the way i saw Nadi she's fat and ugly serves her right for making out elementary school and junior high a living hell. peace love ya all Mer."

You try to reach them, try to be nice, try to be a fucking good girlfriend, good friend, and you know what do they even recognize it??  Do they bother to call you when your uncle dies?  Do they bother to pay for a goddamn fucking movie like a normal boyfriend?  Do they appreciate you??  No fucking way man!!! They call you old. Praise some other girls that aren't even there fucking girlfriends, never call, act shady and shit.  You know fuck you fuck all of you you fucking pieces of shit men.  I need me a real man.  Preferably fucking my age so that people don't have the fucking audacity of saying I am OLD.  Anyways I am going to Spain next year so I will have fun.  If you chose to get enlighted and call which I highly doubt don't expect me to sugar coat the fact that you gave me an attitude for being with your AKA friend Gina?? which happens to be all you talk about all the fucking time.  Date her.  Forget my fucking face and name evidently I was special but no matter other people actually think I am.  When school comes around don't worry I will sit in the front and you will be a shawdow I once knew.  Sorry for thinking I knew you.  Sorry for supposeing you would be a good bf for me.  I guess I was wrong.  Maybe some day we can be friends...when you stop your shady fucking ways...and let someone actually mean something,.. have a nice life and summer...i am done cleaning diapers and waiting for people to actually care about me...too bad you didn't hear me crying that night...then again you never really cared....peace...no hard feelings...it happens to us all........lack of affection just that i have ill luck with landing with guys who really don't care about me...one day i will find a 25 year old man who will care............i am done with teenagers....when your 20 maybe you will realize where i was at...peace have fun with the poser emo chicks...sorry i couldn't be one...men suck...life goes on... i am a fighter....warrior till the end... I am done fighting for realionships that don't fight with me...Yes I am 20 years old and I should know better than to date a younger guy than me...sorry Mark I really am for caring a lot about you and for you to fucking forgetting I was YOUR GIRLFRIEND ... I guess someone has to teach you have to be a boyfriend and you know I am not going to I am too old for that shit ....goodbye and see ya in september maybe then you will actually have the balls to come up to me and talk and actually be a boyfriend not a stranger...goodbye live journal is for people who live there fucking lives through the fucking computer i am not one of those...."

Anyways I woke up this morning at 6:15am.......fuck it sucked..got ready took a bus to NYC( where I get my blasted bus that goes to Montclair) that bus took forever to come. I arrived NYC at around 7:20ish the bus I was suppose to take was suppose to come at 7:45 but it came around 8 so I was like passed out by then......then I took the f......ing bus and I fell asleep on my way over there. I hiked all the way across campus because my luck*** it never dropped me off inside the school by Red Hawk where they are suppose to but now decided to stop.. and had to walk with a heavy bookbag all the way to Bohn where my dingy hot class was to be held from 9 to 12:30 it was hell.......I am surprised that I am even talking because that requires energy I don't have...Typing let alone.......So yeah..I kinda don't feel like doing much. I have to work at 6 but I really don't want to. The truth is I am so broke I have to commute every morning and it costs 15 dollars to go to damn school and to get a ride back. I really need a set of wheels on the reals. 15 dollars every day figure it out I go to school from Monday to Thursday and it's for 3 weeks, plus my precalc book was like 90 which is a shit load considering I am BROKE!!!! I am praying for a job during the weekend so I can pay this shit off. My credit card is like 80 right now that I have to pay before the 28th and I am praying to get my job on Fridays so I can pay that shit off. I get paid 60 a day if I work for my mom's friend in NY so it's a good job so I hope I still have it. Anyways..I want to SLEEPPPPPPPPPPPPP.........zzzzzzzzzzzz I miss sleeping... I need to take this class though I just need to it's just mandatory for my Biology major but it sucks.

"event","""Just Enough To Love You""

Push me out from the darkness
To a sky that's colored blue
Somewhere someone's finding happiness
While I'm still here so hung up on you

Nothing is real
And I want you to know
That I'm not alright
When you tear open my chest
I'll try not to flinch
Won't make promises
You taught me that.
I'm still losing what's left of my self esteem
And I'm still watching the slow fading of all my daydreams

The hardest things to say are the words that mean the most
So I'll bite my tongue til it bleeds and I doubt you'll even know
The easiest things to fake are feelings to fool someone else
And I've been tricked for so long by you that I spent these last few months in my own hell

A failed apology
A day too late but now I see
That all you really want's to see me dangle neck first from a tree
But what would you need me for
You've got friends galore
And all you've ever been to me is a waste of time and nothing more

I could call
But I know that you won't be there to pick up the phone
You don't have time for me
I could call but I know you won't get the phone
Don't have time for me

I hate myself
For loving you like this
I hate myself for hating myself
Just enough to love you
Just enough to love you"

Needs a personal life of mutual understanding and freedom from discord. Has an unsatisfied need to ally herself with others whose standards are as high as her own, and to stand out from the herd. Her control of her sensual instincts restricts her ability to give herself, but the resulting isolation leads to the urge to surrender and allow herself to merge with another. This disturbs her. as such instincts are regarded as weaknesses to be overcome; she feels that only by continued self-restraint can she hope to maintain her attitude of individual superiority. Wants to be loved or admired for herself alone; needs attention, recognition, and the esteem of others. Circumstances are forcing her to compromise, to restrain her demands and hopes, and to forgo for the time being some of the things she wants.Over-imaginative and given to fantasy or day-dreaming. Longs for interesting and exciting things to happen and wants to be admired for her charm.The fear that she may be prevented from achieving the things she wants leads her into a relentless search for satisfaction in the pursuit of illusory or meaningless activities.Feels insufficiently valued in her existing situation, and is seeking different conditions in which she will have greater opportunity of demonstrating her worth. http://www.colorquiz.com/ take it guys it's funny!!!</STRONG></EM></U> </P>

They are given to daydreaming and to contemplation, a combination that can make them seem curiously absent and fey. They are among the most unworldly of all the types. Despite this they have a strong ability for clear, rational thinking that can be startling. They seem to have a deep, intuitive understanding of the oneness of the universe. They have a desire to help the world at large and are acutely aware of and sensitive to suffering. This is partly because they do not recognize the customary boundaries between people, other living things, time, space, this world and the Otherworld. They are frequently psychic. They can be brilliantly original and highly creative. They are usually regarded by others as benign eccentrics or as plain weird.<BR><BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV>

Taking Back Sunday!!! It's a song I am singing now......           
 She said 
""don't, don't let it go to your head 
Boys like you are a dime a dozen, 
Boys like you are a dime a dozen"" 
She said 
""you're a touch overrated, 
you're a lush and I hate it 
but these grass stains on my knees 
they won't mean a thing"" 

And all I (all I) 
Need to know (need to know) 
Is that I'm somethin you'll be missin 
(is that I'm somethin that you're missin) 
(maybe I should hate for this) 
Maybe I should hate you for this 
Never really did ever quite get that far 
(maybe I should hate for this) 
Maybe I should hate you for this 
Never really did ever quite get that... 

I'd never lie to you 
Unless I had to 
I'll do what I got to 
Unless I had to 
I'll do what I go to, the truth 
is you could slit my throat 
And with my one last gasping breath 
I'd apologize for bleedin on your shirt 

And all I (all I)

I am so going to make it work and I don't give a fuck about what people say cause as long as the people I love truly care about me then that's all I have to live for.  I had an amazing day today I went to a hypnotist who told me that I was very psychic and intuitive and that I should play games with myself like guessing who calls me before they do and shit.  I did today, today I was standing outside and I was thinking of Mark while talking to my friend Monica on the phone about how life sucks and then I saw him.  It was also weird because this morning when i woke up I knew I would see someone I haven't seen in a long ass time and I saw Ali my old roomy.  I miss her so much she rules.  Anyways Mark is the sweetest he gave me the best makeup set and shit to cheer me up and crap cause I don't think I passed the chem test but you know I tried so he def cheered me up.  I love how he just steals me away sometimes.....I know that it's just the begginning but I feel that little by little this young man Mark can really really get to know me....the one I hide.....and I get to know him....I think we are starting too.  I think that if we fight all odds we can make this relationship happen.  I mean we already had to fight this dumb bitch I am sure they'll be others but you know what.....all I care about is being held by him...I swear I never knew what safe and warmth and escape felt till he held me threw TBS.  I don't know why but that was the moment I knew that I had to tell him how I felt......I knew he would always look out for me.......i knew that I was finnally found.....he found me...alone in a ditch.....crying for help.....and he didn't even know it.......He makes me smile inside and when I look into his eyes all I can see is how beautiful he looks when he does that little torture close eyes look when I kiss his neck.....aaaaaaaoooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh the things you do to me.........Mark I swear sometimes I think you will tear me apart one good day......but it will be worth it because loving you is the most amazing experience and the most purest of dreams I never thought I could have.......Thank you for making me your g/f and thank you for giving me a chance.....You do see me.......you do.........if you close your eyes and just listen.....you will and do see me......i know that i see you.....you like shadows but i know those too well.you can't hid cause i will find you...If you only knew how much i cherish you and how much I will not do anything stupid to fuck our relationship up.  This summer we will go to the beach.....everywhere we will fight all odds....i will come by bus you will come by car......no matter what happens......we will be together and that's all that matters.......I am willing to fight.......are you???? i will fight anyone and anything because it is all fair in love and war and I will win........I WILL WIN....BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOSE........."

"event","<P><STRONG><EM><U>Yesterday was a cynical day. That's all. When I am mad it is best to not speak to me. Especially if you don't know what to do or say. I don't like it when people don't trust me, because then I feel like I am chasing after a dream that they will never happen. I could care less what a stupid little bitch has to say in her stupid journal and can't say in my FACE!!! but you know what... i really don't want to get kicked out of school and ruin my life for this little girl soooo she will disappear as well as I will from her life. Anyways as I said before, I don't care what you think or what you hear or what people say.......If I prove you wrong that will be enough evidence to you.....I thought I was different to you. I thought you believed me but whatever you might have your little doubts because of the fact that you don't know me for long. No one really knows me. Only my family and friends and even my friends can't reach me when I am in my crazy moods. It's like Fight Club, I feel like him everyday in my life. Like this fucking school is just a bunch of shit and routine and how I just want to beat the shit out of these little white assholes that don't know anything about struggling or fucking trying to get by in the world. This place is not where I long to be and as I try to make friends here i realize how really alone I am and how this place makes me feel worse. Anyways no one can make me happy only I can. I can make myself happy and then I can be happy with others. But like you sometimes I hate myself as much as you do. Remember you just banish yourself when you hate yourself from everyone. I do the same when I am mad. When I am pissed especially if it's not convenient for me to get in a fight. I need to sit it off alone. Cause I am not one to cross when fucking get mad. I hope you never get me pissed cause I swear as much as I care I can not care. I can be a double edged sword. Sometimes shit like this crap stupid bitches getting into my life fucking pisses me off. Usually when asshole girls like that would get into my life I would fuck them up and they would go away. In this case I don't have the luxury to do so. I don't want to fuck up my opportunity to get somewhere in life for some stupid shit like this one. Which with all honestly is the most stupid reason I could think of. Anyways all I have to say is it's not up to you. It's me. If I want to drink.. that's my problem.....If I want to go throw myself out the window it's my problem. You are not a person that is SUPPOSE to make me happy your are a person that makes life easier and makes dreams sometimes come true. So am I. I can't make you happy all the time......If people could do that we would all be happy and not be sad ever....but people we are and sadness is part of life.......that's why this lyric goes out to you......because I care because you are to me special but I don't want you to think you HAVE to make me happy at all times.....because that's just isn't realistic... here goes.......</U></EM></STRONG></P>

<P><PRE>The four-letter word everyone longs to hear
To have that special someone whisper it in your ear
We wait our whole lives for the real thing
Many times mistaking what was only a fling

When you find that someone, you'll know it's real
Because in your heart, it will be love you feel
When you look in their eyes and feel your heart beating
You'll know it's the love that is never fleeting

Unselfishly you give your heart...
Hoping and praying it will not be torn apart
If ever this love proves not to be true
He'll leave with something belonging to you
A part of your heart forever he'll take
You will get over this, for your own sake

After all, you must still go on 
For it is not your whole heart that is gone
Many believe in love at first sight
If you find that someone, hold on tight

Work on the relationship to make it grow
And in time you will know
If this is the love, you've waited your life for
You will never want or need... anything more</PRE><PRE>Today was the greatest day I ever known can't wait till tommorrow tommorrow's much</PRE><PRE>too long.......THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY LIFE A LITTLE BRIGHTER...THANK YOU FOR </PRE><PRE>GIVING ME A CHANCE......TO SEE THE BEAUTIFUL PERSON YOU ARE.....THANK YOU FOR LOVING</PRE><PRE>ME WITH 0UT AGENDAS, OR PRETENTIONS...THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME FEEL WANTED...MARK </PRE><PRE>DREXLER i DON'T THINK I CAN EVER FORGET YOU......JUST DON'T FORGE ME....FLOWERS.</PRE><PRE>ON A SUMMERS DAY......KISS.......I WILL DREAM OF YOU.....</PRE></FONT></U></STRONG>"

I am glad i chose to go with Mark cause A Perfect Circle is romantic music. Anyways I had an amazing time though... I kinda don't feel like writing.....I feel a little breathless or more speachless than anything......so yeah.......i dunno what to say.......i guess i will end it with a poem i heard one day............. The night on the shore a pure girl dreams. She watches the fall, towards the east. High up in the night, while the preda- tor clouds of the evening announce their fury, black oppressi- ve masses, darken her vision of infinity. The stars guide your destiny. Follow them for ever into an oblivion; follow them to dream of infinity; follow them to die happily; follow them to dry all your tears; tears that beleive in their death. Aren't the stars eternal? They reign for ever like queens. They show her their paths. Forget, I'm leaving for their destinations, Melancoly that turns around me, like a thorny rose A thorny rose that winds around me like melancoly"" ""Melancoly that turns around me, like a thorny rose A thorny rose that winds around me like melancoly"" Look over there, the trees next to the frozen lakes are Bored since eternity... Empty and beutiful looks: melancoly... I love you... Same words, same speeches, same gestures Empty and beautiful looks Come and surround me, some and surround me melancoly Come and surround me, some and surround me thorny roses Below the shadow Not a word, not a gesture, beauty... I penetrate the kingdom of death now... Below the shadows, the doors open Not a word, not a gesture, beauty... Below the shadows, the doors open The Sadness.......vampire lyrics.........</EM></U> </FONT>"

I am finally happy and all I get is a psycho bitch telling me I am fucked up cause I am going to a concert with MY BOYFRIEND and not with her. Dude I don't want to date her. Whatever Girls Suck!!! Enough about the sad and demented end of today. Other than that today is so getting better. I saw Marky today!!! He's so fucking funny he told me he was only going to see me for a little today cause he wanted me to do work and he ended up staying!!! HA HA He's so fucking amazing!! I really do care about him. He really doesn't understand how much I really do want us to make it!! I believe we can if he believes too! I mean I will admit I was no angel and probably can never be none of us on Earth can be....but one thing is for sure...... I want to try that's all I can do. I want to be his angel. I hope I can be. He just makes me feel like the old me. The me I used to be innocent and happy naive and dreamy. I mean he just reminds me of all the things I lost because of my past relationships and I feel I am getting the back just by being near him. He has such a great and beautiful personality and essence I wish I could just steal and have him in me forever. So yeah I just want to end it with this note. I am no angel.....but I want to be his. I never felt this way about anyone the truth is I never really cared that much to really try to be the best for anyone I was just me. Mark deserves the best of me and I will give it to him. I don't care what others say and I hope he doesn't either. I hope he weighs my words and not others and that he does test me so I can prove to him that I am what I say I am. Today is the future...my future is brighter because of him!! Love~Mari</STRONG></EM></U>"

you're nothing i ever want to be.
my ears still won't pop.
is it weird that i can't sleep with socks on?
give me a little truth, please.
love is a false reality.
that is truth.
i'm a really good decoy for what you actually want.
sometimes all i need is a little inspiration.
i want to be in love.
i hate that drugs make me feel so good.
change is so necessary.

"event","Okay, I know most of you also have facebooks or we keep in touch otherwise, so about 95% of you know what went on with one mr. William Robinson. For the rest of you, all you really have to know is it's over. Forever. For good. Eternally. Never again will I fall for a boy 
1. with no respect for my intelligence 
2. still not over his ex
3. weak in spirit
4. rude to his parents
5. who will lose his temper in front of my parents
6. resentful of me in any way, shape, or form
7. judgmental of my smoking
8. judgmental of my drinking
9. with sociopathic tendencies

i'm better off. this, i know.

and though this has all happened relatively recently, i'm okay. i mean, yeah, i'm fucked up in the sense that this is yet another male i've put my faith in who has let me down (this time more than once), but i know i will be okay. i know i can be happy without him. and that is the best feeling, the most comforting feeling, a woman can have.


onto bigger and better things. this is chicago; there are snobby indie boys around every corner. i'm bound to find one i connect with.



aaaanyway. so i went to this party last night. i had a big debate with myself whether to withdraw money i shouldn't withdraw to go see hot chip in a situation that would have surely been awkward, or go to a party in some highrise uptown. party ended up being a lot of fun. i ended up drunk, and the perfect amount of drunk, too. i'm relearning my limits after that little incident in wrigleyville a few weeks ago. no more toilets for gaby!

maybe i'll stop smoking. maybe i'll stop drinking. maybe i'll stop spending money.
these are the thoughts that go through my head every day.


i want a cigarette."

i am going to take a train to west texas soon to work at my grandfather's pharmacy to train to be a pharmacist's technician, which will get me 15 bucks an hour in a big city like chicago.

<font size=""+1""><lj-cut text=""so prom was amazing...""></font>
This has been an absolutely incredible weekend. It started off on Friday, when Will came in at 8:35 from Chicago. I ran ahead of my mom and brother so I could kiss him without them watching. We then went to my house where Will met my entire immediate family.
After some dinner, my dad entrusted in Will his lexus, which he drove the the movie theatre. Accompanied by my brother. We made Diego go see a different movie while we went to the Pink Panther, which had a surprisingly large number of little kids considering it was 9:45. The Pink Panther was less than extraordinary.
When we got back home, he and I sat out on my playset thing in my backyard. We talked a lot and kissed a lot and the weather was so nice.
Saturday morning, we had to wake up early to go to Churchill for a literary criticism tournament. I had to do lit crit, along with features writing and news writing. I had no idea what I was doing with the latter two, but Will and I hung out a bit with Lauren and Susan. Afterwards, Will and I went with my mom and Javier to the Alamo. I don't know why, but my mom insisted that Will needed to see it (she thought it his first visit to Texas.) So we hung around there for a bit, before going home. At home, Will read to me, and it was bliss. Then we got ready for prom.
Long story cut short, prom was amazing. The after party at Bryzki's house was amazing. Falling asleep in Will's arms and waking up there was amazing. I can't remember ever being as happy as I was to be woken up this morning by a flood of natural light illuminating the sleeping and shirtless figure of Will laying next to me. Bliss.
I owe my parents so much for this weekend.
I get to see Will again in less than a week!

That's my last Duchess painted on the wall, 
Looking as if she were alive. I call 
That piece a wonder, now: Fra Pandolf's hands 
Worked busily a day, and there she stands. 
Will't please you sit and look at her? I said 
""Fra Pandolf"" by design, for never read 
Strangers like you that pictured countenance, 
The depth and passion of its earnest glance, 
But to myself they turned (since none puts by 
the curtain I have drawn for you, but I) 
And seemed they would ask me, if they durst, 
How such a glance came there; so not the first 
Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, 'twas not 
Her husband's presence only, called that spot 
Of joy into the Duchess's cheek: perhaps 
Fra Pandolf chanced to say ""Her mantle laps 
Over my lady's wrist too much,"" or Paint 
Must never hope to reproduce the faint 
Half flush that dies along her throat"": such stuff 
Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough 
For calling up that spot of you. She had 
A heart--how shall I say?--too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate'er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 
Sir, 'twas all one! My favor at her breast, 
The dropping of the daylight in the West, 
The bough of cherries some officious fool 
Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule 
She rode with round the terrace--all and each 
Would draw from her alike the approving speech, 
Or blush, at least. She thanked men--good! but thanked 
Somehow--I know not how--as if she ranked 
My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name 
With anybody's gift. Who'd stoop to blame 
This sort of trifling? Even had you skill 
In speech--(which I have not)--to make your will 
Quite clear to such a one, and say, ""Just this 
Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss 
Or there exceed the mark""--and if she let 
Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set 
her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse 
--E'en then would be some stooping; and I choose 
Never to stoop. Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt 
Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without 
Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands; 
Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands 
As if alive. Will't please you rise? We'll meet 
the company below, then. I repeat 
The Count your master's known munificence 
Is ample warrant that no just pretense

So, a week after UT, I am going to post about it.
First of all, ASHA! I missed you X infinity. Your sister being there kind of helped because every once in  a while I thought she was you, but for the most part it sucked.
Second of all, as many of you may know, Nicole, Max and I got in trouble for crossing Guadalupe. Eanes flipped and gave us a big lecture. We don't have his trust anymore ): . 
Third of all, this week has been one of the strangest and most stressful ever. Monday, I had to deal with Eanes twofold: first, during his lecture, second, when he refused to allow Nicole and I to go to the Westlake tournament because he ""didn't think it's a good idea."" Well, screw him! Then I had a calc test, and my mom finally realized that math isn't my subject and is letting me drop out. I'm going to take up creative writing avec Ms Seay, the coolest teacher EVER!
Last night was one of my oddest in a while. I did something I didn't expect to... and I am still not sure how I feel about it.
Nicole turned 18 yesterday, so today we (well, she) bought cigarettes. And practiced holding them. For her humorous. Yeah, we're rebels.
Tomorrow, I think she, Allison, and I are going shopping in Austin. That should be fun. Maybe we'll stop by the tournament. I also want to see GP, whom we haven't seen since Harlingen.
Anyway, je suis fatiguee!
Good night, and I love you,
Gaby!"

So Glenbrooks sucked as a tournament, but was a TON of fun. People who were there:
Kadi
Ricky
Ashley
Row
Gordon
Louis
Richard
Ashley
Hanna
Chelsea
Luke
and a couple of extempers I don't really know

So it was fucking awesome getting to see everyone. 
Ricky -  I think it's funny how we didn't speak to each other at all at camp, but once we were in Chicago, we became friends!
I missed you, Colby!
On Monday, we went to the art museum and walked down the magnificent mile and I hung out with Katherine and we explored downtown Chicago (well, I explored. She knew where she was going). And I went to her apartment and she gave me an awesome present and I missed her so much and if you're reading this I love you!

I am soooooooo glad I got to see everyone from camp! I love you all!!!!!! And I miss you already!

Oh! And at the Chicago airport, we randomly ran into Lexi Pelayo. How weird/random/strange is that? She looks terrible!

And today I saw Morgan! Andrew and I met her at the airport and that was super fun. Then I went to Halffy's house and we watched Legally Blonde. I'd missed all my college friends.

So many reunions!"

Wow. Harlingen sucks. The tournament sucks. Nicole, who won St. Marks in HI, got a 5 in prelims, keeping her from breaking. This is so dumb. I bet Natalie Baker is behind it!
We considered staying another night after we ate, but decided that the extra expense wasn't something we wanted to spend. Mama Munoz is by far one of the coolest parents of all time.
I adore Zechariah Leal for reasons quite clear.
I had a great time friday night. It was brilliant being able to sleep in a bed with my husband in the same room as four of my favourite people.
I am going to be in Austin on Wednesday to see Harry Potter early, and hopefully I'll be able to go up Thursday to see Peter Pan. I want to see my lovers in action!
I am going to go hang out with David. We're going to Planet K. It'll be a blast.

Peace &love,
Gabriella

6) i will never escape my past
7) i'm terrible at science (this one wasn't really new)
8) i never once made him happy
9) i am disliked very much by him
10) he almost hates me

good to know.

oh, and he had the audacity to ask me for the paintings he gave me back. right.

<b><lj-cut text=""if you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends""></b>
So today has been sooooooo long. Started off with working on our Reader's Theatre project. We did that from about 10-1:30. I think we've pretty much wrapped it up. Then, Nicole picked me up and we were gonna go meet JM at North Star, but we ended up eating at EZs. Then we were gonna go to La Cantera, but we ended up in Austin. We tried on lots of cool outfits. It was fun. Then we ate at Madam Mam's, and somehow ended up at the Austin High (SFA) Tournament. It was great seeing everyone and not having to wear a suit. Eanes' exact words when he saw us were, ""What the hell are they doing here?"" I love all of you guys, and I'll see you at Harlingen. Same hotel: W00T!

love to all of you,
gabriella.

PS, I can't believe the bastard lied about his scores. That's so funny! I beat his ass! W00T!

<i>from left:</i>Matt, Colin, Lauren, Viva, Asha, Me, and some random guy I met last night. I think his name is Kyle?
<b><lj-cut text=""What is love? This is love! Babies, don't hurt me!""></b>
So I officially had the most amazing weekend of my life.
As for friday night, all I can say is people can surprise you. Pleasantly.

And tonight. Oh, tonight. I got to Austin at about 1:30, and I met up with Johnathon and Viva at Jamba. The first thing I said to them was, ""It's good to be home."" So we got Jamba, then met up with Jesse Gall (who, if you're reading this, I LOVE!) at Chipotle, and met a Katy who is apparently everyone from Tennessee's best friend. She was pretty awesome. Then we bought Asha a birthday present (2, actually) and went to Johnathon's apartment. Hung out there for about twenty minutes, then went to Viva's house and hung out there for a few hours. I was so amazingly content just being there, like we're normal friends who don't live an hour and a half away! We wrapped Asha's present (the wrapping paper I used matched my dress!) and then Asha came and we all got ready together. (Oh yeah, at some point, Johnathon left.) Then we went to Macaroni Grill, with the entire underclassmen class of Westlake, and had an amazing dinner with Gary, Colin, Lauren, and Cristina (also with Asha's family, of course). La la la, food, singing, cake, then we go to homecoming. 
The first thing we hear walking in is the chicken dance. Great first impression. I'm not gonna lie: I was pretty uncomfortable the first 30 or so minutes, because I didn't know a single person besides the people I was with. AND I was in a pink polka-dotted dress (which ended up getting a few compliments before the night was over). 
La la la, we danced and stuff. Gold digger came on, which made me quite happy. Lots of dancing and getting sweaty. At one point, Wonderful Tonight came on, which made me kind of sad. I walked away from the mass of people to try and control myself and wonderful wonderful Colin came over and danced with me to comfort me. He's such an awesome husband. Now, whenever I hear that song ""I knew I loved you before I met you,"" I am going to think of him. I hadn't slow danced with anyone since Westlake's prom in May! 
I thought it was curious that the people I vaguely know from tournaments didn't even think twice about me being at their homecoming. It was as though it was to be expected.
My last dance was with Cristina, Asha, Aviva, and Lauren, all of us in one big huddled mass, dancing to that song that goes 
""One: you're like a dream come true. Two: just wanna be with you. Three: girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me and Four: repeat steps one through three. Five: make you fall in love with me. If ever I believe my work is done, then I start back at one.""

I love all of you, my darlings, sooooo much. You are amazing. I had an amazing night with all of you. I'm sorry I couldn't stay longer. But one day soon, babies; One day soon.

Goodnight! And I love you!

Wow. What a tournament. I took almost 400 pictures. www.photobucket.com/albums/b229/wc4n6 .

A huge congratulations to everyone. It was fantastic staying in the same hotel as Westlake, especially as I spent most of the two of my three nights in one of their beds (or couches, as you would have it). I missed people, though, like Jesse and Kadi! Don't worry kids, we were thinking of you.

We went on a lot of fun adventures. They included tournament hobos sleeping in dark corridors and molesting a wall painting (see above). Despite the many rules I broke this weekend, I did not get caught. It's not like what I did did any harm, anyway.

Anyway:
My Westlake darlings,
I will be joining you for dinner and a dance this Saturday. Whether or not I will attend the after party remains to be seen. I certainly hope so. Viv-babe, we need to get our hair done! I want to be girly, dammit! I am so excited.

Speaking of Westlakers: Gary Jaffe! You amaze me! Your poster for Peter Pan is absolutely exquisite. I am going to try and see it on Wednesday (we leave for Glenbrooks on Thursday). Will you save me a poster to hang on my wall so I can always see my lovely Tink, Nana, and Cpt. Hook?

I'm exhausted. I love you all."

It has been an all right day. This morning, I had pancakes and got three cds:
The Last 5 Years (I had this one... and then lost it.... before i had put it into my computer... so I bought it again.)
The Wild Party (Upon Leonard's suggestion.)
The Carpenters' Love Songs (Because I'm a silly girl.)
The Wild Party led to me playing dress up, as you can see in the picture above. I tried to look as twenties as I could. For more, see http://photobucket.com/albums/a277/GabriellaMarie/ and go to the sub-album, Dress Up.
I watched Cinderella with my 8-year-old sister. It was divine.
Then, this evening, I got fed up with staying at home. I went out with David and Austin and David's brother, Vic. We ended up meeting Nicole and Allison at Chili's, where we had a bit of a run-in with the manager, due to David. We then went to go see Waiting, which just may be the funniest movie I have ever seen.
I'm supposed to go out with someone tomorrow. I wonder if that will happen. If you read this, dear, call me and let me know.
Oh, and I had a really nice dream last night. But I can't tell, because as Cinderella tells us, a dream is a wish your heart makes, and you can't tell wishes or else they won't come true.

<i>a dream is a wish your heart makes
when you're fast asleep
in dreams you will lose your heartaches
whatever you wish for, you keep
have faith in your dreams and someday
your rainbow will come smiling through
no matter how your heart is grieving
if you keep on believing
the dream that you wish will come true</i>


goodnight, and thank you."

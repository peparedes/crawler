I thought we were in this together
But time has passed and faces changed
Your not holding on to what is true
True as my love for you
Hearts bleed from over exposure to the pain you bring
Your decision's no concern for me

For this I hope u suffocate in your own misery
To me your like heaven
But to others all you'll ever be is a piece of ass
Like water, like candy, like fire

Buried in the monster you created
I've risen from the depths, aided by your drudgery
Once the victim now the hunter, I shot back
killing you, yet at the same time ending my life
Wishing i never fought back, wishing i never fired the shot
 

Your contagious kiss i wont forget
The good, the bad, and the ugly made us what we are today
Memories etched in my mind by your beauty
Memories scorched in my heart by your betrayal"

She always looks perfect
Sitting by the phone waiting for her call
I'd be so pleased to see you out of the class room
Wearing a smile I'd bring to you
I was hopeing to learn a few things that I'd like to know
Like do u like making out,long walks down the beachor courageous talks
These are all a few things that I'd like to know

The fumes of your beauty make my heart dream of happiness
Your voice no sound compares, words you speak contempt
Words which ease their way on down to my aching heart
Releasing pain dampened by all from deep inside

Your my all you mean to me
I fail to gain ur acceptance, for myself dies each night
Failing myself i dare to ask, fear of disapproval from you
Hurt felt each time I try, Death blessed to me each time I LOVe"

THe tears of a dieing man

REligion
To to religion is a way to look at death and be happy about it..But why should anyone look forward to die? Life is beautiful and death is to but when your happy about it it makes death the ugliest thing imaginable...So why don't you just get used to the fact that death is inevitable and life isn't that long so don't waste your time praying because it's a lost cause...
Today my mother and i were picking up my brother and this kid came up to me and asked ""why don't you believe in god?"" I said ""Because i'm smart and your dumb"" ""Well then who made the earth?"" ""Do you think someone just flipped a switch and poof the earth is made?""...Geeze This is what i mean They feed there children shit so they will by into there lies...AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO SEES THIS?!?!?
People are so stupid and i can't take there ignorance anymore...

"event","Despite what some of my Facebook, MySpace and Livejournal friends said about New Moon, I loved it.  The shirtless eye candy was a plus but they did a really good job on this one.  The special effects weren't as bad as I thought they would be and they did a really good job on the wolves.
<lj-cut text=""Maybe some spoilers back here. "">

The love triangle was just a frustrating as the book. 

There is something about Edward that bugs me, maybe it's his lack of expression and emotion, he's just so shady, he is in the book, it bothers me. Robert Pattinson does a really good job as Edward, hides everything. His face is always cold, he really doesn't smile unless he is benefiting from it, his own cold humor.  I wanted to scream because I just wanted him to kiss her.  He lies to protect Bella and it broke my heart for a second when he leaves her, I actually felt emotions for her. 

I am fascinated by the Cullen family.  Carlisle is such a soft, charming character, just like the vampires in this series should be.  Esme is loving and kind, I love how she just tries to make Bella feel like family.  Rosalie annoys me with her ""woe is me, I didn't have a choice"" crap, but she seems to pull out of it in New Moon, explaining her decision to vote against Bella becoming a monster.  Jasper is still a blood thirsty animal in a family of ""vegetarian"" vampires, and his behavior in New Moon shows it a lot more than Twilight, he's blood hungry and snaps.  Alice is so adorable, she wins my heart for coolest vampire, she's overly sweet and there is just something I like about her.  Emmett, poor Emmett didn't get much screen time in this movie but he's just so cool, I love Emmett.  I enjoy the daywalking vampires, the sparkling in the sun is a bit much.  I also find it interesting that they don't have fangs, this is a new take on vampires and it is definitely different than our fanged favorites in other movies.  

Bella hasn't started annoying me too much yet, but I know it's coming. Her affinity with immortality is disheartening. She has a choice but she is so infatuated with it, it's getting unbelievable. She is so in love with Edward and she does all these crazy things, like the motorcycle, to just see a glimpse of him telling her that what she is doing is wrong.  The way she blows Jacob off was so cold-hearted, as if she didn't know he would risk his life for her. Her happiness in the Volturi when she finds out she HAS to become a vampire to save both her and Edward made me cringe.  

Jacob is charming, it's hard to not fall in love with him and feel really bad for him when Bella treats him like she does. I knew Edward was going to come back but I wished that he didn't so that Jacob could be happy, he shows emotion and expression, he seems sincere.  Could he ever actually be happy with Bella?  She would always be stuck on Edward and becoming a vampire, his life would be miserable.  He's so young and his heart brings him to an unhappy place, he's possessive of Bella.  He's just so kind hearted.  When he shape-shifts at the end to confront Edward and, as a wolf, you can see his extreme sadness in his eyes, this is when I had my own tears.  I just wanted to hug him and tell him it was going to be okay, leave damned Bella alone with her Vamped world, she's not worth the heartache.

The wolves were a lot better than I expected.  They did really well with them, considering they are CG.  When I seen them attack Laurent, I initially thought they were lame, but they grew one me.  I actually liked with Jacob turned when he was protecting Bella after she slapped Paul, it looked pretty cool.  I also like Stephani Meyer's take on the wolves and the Indian heritage that it follows, it wasn't just anyone who shape-shifted like in most ""WereWolf"" movies.  It's a pretty interesting concept. 

All in all, I am glad that I have taken well to the Twilight series.  My sister and I have lots of discussions about it.  I hope to finish the books before the next movie (time is a bad thing, I don't have much of it) but I think I may be sad that it's all over when I'm done."

"event","So, tonight is my last night in Jersey.  I'm not really taking it very well.  Packing my stuff back into my suitcase has become something that I am dreading to go back to because I broke down doing it earlier this evening.   I guess packing, to me, is leaving everything behind.  I don't want to go back to Louisiana.  I want to stay here with him.  I really don't want to get on that plane tomorrow but I know that I have to.  I have things in Louisiana that depend on me, my pets, my job and I have school.  Maybe after school is over, I can move here.  

 The ball has always been in Damien's court.  

I met two of his friends on Friday and Carrie asked him if she could keep me.=,o(  She asked when I was moving up here because she wants to take me shopping =o().  I was so worried that his friends wouldn't like me, but the two that I met loved me.  It felt good that I fit into his group of friends.  

Damien and I did go back to Eastern State ( easternstate.org ) today for a daytime tour.  We both took tons of pictures, his camera is better than mine so I'll be posting them as soon as he uploads them to me.

Off to go back to packing, I hope I can make it through.

Back home to Louisiana tomorrow.  Farewell for now, New Jersey."

"event","<p>Damien and I went to the town of Cape May today. We took a little detour to go to the Cape May Lighthouse. It was beautiful. There were a lot going on there, we even seen retired Greyhounds and Huskies. There were tons of people sky watching for hawks, we seen a few along with an bald eagle, white swans and lots of Canadian Geese. Butterflies everywhere, sooooo pretty.</p><p>After our little detour, we finally made it Cape May an walked around. The weather was beautiful and we were able to get some sun. We ate at Godmother's. Best Italian food ever.</p><p>My obsession with Eastern State Penn continues tomorrow, we are going to take the day tour for my birthday. </p><p>I am so happy here. Tuesday is getting here too quickly and even if I try to put the thinking of it to Tuesday, it still lingers and is pretty painful. I wish I could finally stay here with him.. Not this time.........</p><p><em><small>Posted via <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/cosysoftware_en/"">LiveJournal.app</a>.</small></em></p>"

I know this is late and, to some people, beyond valid. I was introduced to Mike Corrado's music recently and I love him. I was given the song ""Damn"" and fell into it, went and find him on iTunes (yay iPod).

Mike Corrado is a Marine. Mike Corrado wrote and sings this song, along with Edwin McCain. I have just brought myself to watch this video, I couldn't for a while. The song touched me so hard that I couldn't watch the video.

To all the military, thank you. To the Marines, past present and future,you have this special place in my heart. Thank you."

Wow.  I am from Southern Louisiana, Bayou Country.  The most interesting thing to see here is that there is a bayou that splits LA 1 and LA 308.  It is definitely something different.  The bayou is always full of boats and local wildlife. If I ever leave this place, I would probably miss it's total uniqueness."

His flight from El Paso was to AZ, he was suppose to fly from AZ to Dallas and into New Orleans.  Where's the problem?  There is bad weather in Dallas and they couldn't fly in.  He is going to be here tomorrow NIGHT instead. I lose a whole fucking day with him."

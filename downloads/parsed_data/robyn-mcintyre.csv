The inside of my brain looks like this:



















That's right -- nothing at all. I am out to sea, I am absolutely blank. Somebody hold up a mirror, somebody light a match; see what happens, see if I grimace or melt. At the edges, in the ridges of my skull, everything is pressing on my meninges, trying to get in. What do I do?"

I'm not sure what to do. I need to come up with a magic solution. I need to find some sort of way to show her that she's WARM, goddammit, she's made of skin and blood and bone.

But will that fix it? ...I need to accomplish two things:

1) show her her own needs, if in truth they're there, and make her know that they aren't weaknesses, and 

2) stop her from having random moments like this.

I'm getting nowhere with my limited information. We need to talk."

We said friendly things and paused where the I love yous should have been. I held my breath hoping she wouldn't slip and say it.

I'm ready not to be eighteen any longer. I don't want to be a student, and I don't want to share a shitty apartment with two perverted slobs, and I don't want her to need their blood money. Gripe, grouse. But I can't help it. I just keep thinking about the woods... Maybe I will write some vastly popular work of fiction and become disgustingly wealthy enough for us to buy an island somewhere in the tropics.

"event","I was watching Sophie from the roof of Craig, the sunset of a warm evening, the calm hour before bat time. I felt somehow more peaceful about her and about everything than I ever had, and I wondered why until Dracula walked quietly forward to stand beside me without speaking. Ordinarily she would have tried to distract and cheer me with stories and small talk, but she seemed in tune with my mood and sat wordlessly at my right. 

I watched Sophie below as she swang, threw and ran. I loved her sticklike arms, her bobbling run like a marionette. I even loved her stupid little shoes. Her hair was childish in pigtails and I lost track, as I so often had, of my role in her life -- was I mother or friend? For just a moment, I didn't know. This creature, this small girl, baby bird -- she would never know the value of what she had held in her own two hands and let slip away. She would never know what I had represented for her, nor the sacrifices I had made to extend her chance after chance after chance to let me help her. For a year and a half I had tried tirelessly, and then she had tired of me. I was going to have to walk away and be okay with that.

As I looked, I saw suddenly in her movements what she must have been like as a girl of twelve, eight, six -- even as a toddler. The face smoothed and the eyes calmed; the hands lost their restlessness and the skull its ravenous hunger. Her spine seemed less strained. I realized I was looking at a Sophie I could have saved -- a younger person whose needs were simpler and whose tendency toward trust was greater. I was too tired to cry, but tears slid down my face involuntarily. It ocurred to me that I was seeing Sophie for what would necessarily be the last time. I took a few moments to get used to that.

Walking back to the road, Dracula followed me at a short distance, and when I turned she was watching me thoughtfully. We went on for a while before she caught me up with a simple question, simply phrased: ""Are you free yet?""

I smiled because I had been so tired. ""Yeah,"" I said."

I was a little vague and off in my own little world when Mei turns to me (we'd been talking about the cancer) and says, ""I think you're going to follow her."" I asked in what way... she said, ""Your childhood dream is coming true, even if you can't see it yet. Do you want to die?"" I didn't know what to say, because I couldn't remember having told her anything about that. She was silent for a little while and then she said, ""Listen, don't worry about it. Whatever happens, I'm sure you'll be all right."" I said I had never felt more alone than when she said that; how could she know anything about me? I looked back at her and for a second the act slipped and I saw through to the other side of what she meant, and I could see she saw me watching her. She got up and walked away. When I looked back to where she'd been I saw what I somehow hadn't noticed behind her: a human skeleton, one long arm around the seat of the couch where Mei had been sitting. Its posture was very familiar, and the ribs of its chest were patchily black and grey, like something out of a child's drawing... the bone was freshly dead. The cartilege was still shiny, as though it had been stripped of flesh. I'm amazed at the stupid, scary shit my brain comes up with while I sleep.

This just can't be the only answer. I need to do some more serious thinking.

"event","How to make a sepia print

Toning a print sepia (brown) gives it a warmer appearance, and can also be used to give an impression of age. Sepia toners usually produce silver sulphide which makes prints more stable. Here's How: 

1.	Always read the manufacturer's instructions with any photographic chemicals you buy. Most sepia toners work in the way described below, but others do not. Use gloves or tongs. 
2.	Start with a black and white print that has been given slightly more than normal exposure and has been fully washed. It can be wet or dry. 
3.	Immerse this in the first solution (bleach), which is usually yellow. For full toning agitate until the print has lost all black and is a pale brown colour. 
4.	Rinse the print in running water until all traces of yellow from the bleach have gone. 
5.	Immerse in the second solution (toner) and the print will rapidly darken. Agitate until there is no further change in colour - usually from 2-5 minutes. 
6.	Wash the print for 2-3 minutes for RC paper and 30-60 minutes for FB paper. 
7.	Give a final rinse - 1 minute - in a dilute solution of a photographic wetting agent. 
8.	Dry as normal for the paper type 

Tips: 
1.	Some sepia toners give offensive smelling and toxic fumes, particularly if you make your own using formulae in books. If using these, work out of doors. 
2.	Some commercial toners come with an additive that can be used to produce different brown tones. 
3.	Partial toning is often more effective - you may need to dilute the bleach to control it. Full sepia toning is useful for prints that are to be hand coloured."

FERN HILL

Now as I was young and easy under the apple boughs
About the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,
The night above the dingle starry
Time let me hail and climb 
Golden in the heydays of his eyes,
And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns
And once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves
Trail with daisies and barley
Down the rivers of the windfall light.

And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns
About the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,
In the sun that is young once only,
Time let me play and be
Golden in the mercy of his means,
And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calves
Sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and cold,
And the sabbath rang slowly
In the pebbles of the holy streams.

All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay
Fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was air
And playing, lovely and watery
And fire green as grass.
And nightly under the simple stars
As I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,
All the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, the nightjars
Flying with the ricks, and the horses
Flashing into the dark.

And then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer white
With the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was all
Shining, it was Adam and maiden,
The sky gathered again
And the sun grew round that very day.
So it must have been after the birth of the simple light
In the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walking warm
Out of the whinnying green stable
On to the fields of praise.

And honored among foxes and pheasants by the gay house
Under the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,
In the sun born over and over,
I ran my heedless ways,
My wishes raced through the house high hay
And nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allows
In all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songs
Before the children green and golden
Follow him out of grace,

Nothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time would take me
Up to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,
In the moon that is always rising,
Nor that riding to sleep
I should hear him fly with the high fields
And wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.
Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,
Time held me green and dying
Though I sang in my chains like the sea."

Well. And there I am again.
Sometimes I think, if only we could just stop <i>lying</i> to each other all the time. I'll swear before God and everyone, 99% of it is habit. Habit, and those times when I use the lie to tell the truth about things too delicate to come at directly. I can't tell whether she does that, too. She says she trusts me. I'm trying to cut close enough to the heart of what the hell I'm talking about to know whether I trust her like that, in the way that I mean. Off the top of my head I can think of nothing I wouldn't tell her. I think if we read each other's journals we'd feel like we were each reading our own. I wonder what she'd say to that.

My mother has tried to persuade me not to go to Philly. But there is a difference between sanity and happiness, and I can be sane on my own but not happy, and if I know that that's all there is and all there ever will be, that sanity, then I will lose my mind. I don't know when I've been more rightly happy, or more at war.

Right now I'm curled here on my bed, watching her sleep after all the swearing and exclamations. Crickets are cricketting outside, horses are flashing into the dark. It's summer in every sense of it, right down to the corn.

Right, never mind all that, and everything else -- to business. I need to just do this, or it will never get done:

After Kade and Jamie left us we were on the stone staircase. The floor below was polished stone; redstone, I think, and gray-white granite, possibly with black marble. I was standing outside of the railing, on the lip of the step, facing her. She was holding my hands and making me repeat her words -- sort of like uhpynye glahm kerroum, an alphabet feeling, although she said it was a language. I didn't know at the time that there was no last word, but it would have comforted me. So we were going over and over the beginning of it, and I was trying not to close my eyes out of habit because, as always, I was having trouble reading her. I felt safe, partially because of the words, and partially because she seemed to me to be in a less dangerous mood. She was holding my hands from the other side of the railing, keeping me there, and she may have kissed me (check on that). I didn't know then that there was more than one person in her head, so I wasn't scared. There were people upstairs, far away down the hall toward the studio. (I think maybe they were painting the walls?) I could hear their voices distantly, and then one of them called her name. She turned her head and as she did so she let go of my hands. I don't know why I never thought to grab the railing -- all or nothing? -- but I overbalanced, reaching for her hands, and began to fall. As I went backward she walked up the stairs and out of sight as though she had forgotten I was there.

The annoying thing about this is that today I was able for the first time to see her face clearly and it looked like mine crossed with Sophie's... Actually, it was more like it wavered between the two. I really, really hope that that changes, because I don't need to go into it for the sake of a face. I don't even like this that much. Another Zosia-related problem? I can only hope so.

I had this weird dream that Mindy and I and Algernon and also my Beau and Sienna and Prokynthia, of all people, took a road trip to the ocean. When we got to the beach there was an enormous purple bouncy-bounce on the sand and the entire EWS junior class was playing on it. They saw us and all and started singing this weird song to the tune of ""The Big Rock Candy Mountain,"" only they'd revised it to talk about the Magic Flying Beetroot Plant instead. I wrote the lyrics in the sand because they reminded me of Lewis Carroll and then the seagulls took it up, which sounded awful, so we all started eating these special lavender-lemon pasteils which blocked out the sound... But then I looked down and in the sand the words I had written were in Rachel's handwriting. I spat out the pasteils and started shouting to Nicky, asking her whether she had done it, but somehow she was drunk or Zen as well as deaf and couldn't understand me. I was just getting scared when ProK behind me pointed at the waves, and there was Rachel, thigh-deep in the water. I forgot she was dead and started to run toward her, but the water thickened my stride. She laughed at me the way she did -- an uninvolved smirk -- then drew from the surf her old purple book of notes and held it out as though asking if I wanted it (I was too far from her to hear her voice). Without waiting she turned and began to walk pensively into the ocean (I imagine she came from it, although her clothes were dry). She seemed to have forgotten I was there, and as she went she tore out pages (also dry) and ate them. Somehow she was still walking knee-deep and I was over my head following her, swimming so hard I was choking on seawater. I turned around and the beach was very far away, and that scared the hell out of me. When I looked back Rachel was gone, but I heard her voice saying, ""Katie, who is it you're talking to?"" In the middle of the sentence I woke up, but her voice carried over into my room.

It's so annoying to keep having this. I don't know why water is such a theme, either -- it's odd of me. I'm writing something really bad which should help, about everything. It's long, though, and I'm really hoping at this point that it's going to hold together well enough to be a single piece, because I'm really not up to making a whole lot of little bits.

Sigh... back to work."

"event","In other news, I went to bed and had the BEST dream ever, in which the world ended and turned into a giant ball of water after God sunk everything into the sea and then erased it and himself. It was the BEST because it was a warm rain, and in the end all that was left was the three of us in our fishbowl-planet. No God; no rainbow. It was perfect. It really put my priorities in order.

I've also written this really oddly pretty thing which stems from one of my earlier weird Nicky moments. I know I'll hate it the next time I look at it, but for now I'm stubbornly proud of myself. (Is it a bad thing, though, that it makes me nervous when I like something I've written for more than ten minutes? Hmm.)

Right then. Back to beaming..."

"event","I seem to have gotten myself permanently attached to two very terrific people, neither of whom wants to immediately leave the country, and one of whom I feel the need to hang out with on a very regular basis or I will be dim and depressed in a sort of indescribable, lonely, bleh way.

It's occurred to me that if we have the same brain, then why wouldn't I... I don't know. I'm kind of worried about what's going to happen because I can sort of see what she means, and it's looking like it's inevitable that we will at some point hang out, and I don't know how that's going to work. I'm probably worrying for no reason, as always, but I can't shake it. 

I'm glad I've figured out what I'm doing, at least in the short term. I think I sort of knew I wasn't going to stick it out in the FWP. Bryn Mawr doesn't actually look so deeply awful, if I can get in. I also need to find out what other schools there are in Philadelphia. Tomorrow I'm going to ask Laura for advice about this next semester, because I really don't know even how to begin. Working in Philadelphia... Hmm.

It's really bothersome that I don't know where I stand. I mean, I think I do, but then shit happens and I'm back where I started. Later tonight I'll call her and she'll probably say something which means, ""I didn't really mean that. Find a way to go to school. We can hang out later."" I can't help it, but I still feel very much like the third wheel; like I don't actually matter here and I'm deluding myself. It's really, really annoying, because I have this vision of myself busting my ass to go to Bryn Mawr and find a way to live in PA, and then something changes, in her or with the boy, and suddenly I'm left alone in PA, with Amish people and whatever sort of school or job I've managed to dig up. This risk is better than the certainty of the FWP, but still it's not a good feeling. I'm doing it anyway; it's just bothering me to feel this insecure about everything."

"event","Crowding is <i>insane</i> today. I must have seen Cathy alone about five times already, and I've been awake for around two and a half hours. I've also had a little bit of a sort of leech/watercolour thing -- only peripherally, and really nothing too extraordinary, but for the timing. Lack of sleep? But I've slept badly before, and this has never happened.

I'm not worried, though. I should probably be freaking out now for other reasons (below), but I'm not. Ah, sweatshirt. *Cuddles*

Last night was really odd. This is such a confounding situation... but I can't help feeling, still, like I have no idea where I did anything wrong. I swear I didn't! ...And yet, here we are. We're thinking of having a powwow, if we can swing it with Mindy. The more shit happens the more it seems to me that we really should just all talk about this together, come what may, rather than avoiding it as we have been and using Algernon as a sort of go-between. At this point I think it would definitely make things less awkward (*cough*choirconcert*cough*). In any case, I agree that I'm a temporary part of a larger problem. I'd like to help it, and I feel like I'm pretty unavoidably involved, but I don't want to intrude.

In other news, I finally heard back from Boo: Diana flaked, but Charlie is a go, strong as ever. We've set it for Thursday 21h00. So far we have Charlie, myself, Boo, Cara, and Baby. I really think we can pull this off, and I'm glad. Much as I love them, they need to get past it.

Also found an ending for my pacing scene. I have mixed feelings about it because it assumes a sort of classically romantic element which is not in the rest of it, but which fits perfectly with both Diana and my younger one. I think I might need to rewrite it. That's such a bitch, but I think I can do it if I go back carefully in my mind and reset it all, and really firm it up before I look at the text and start making changes. What's really bothering me is that the piece as it is now is strong -- just unfinished. If I change everything I worry that I'll sacrifice what I've got. The two possibilities aren't alike enough to stay in my brain together, and if I try I'll wind up with a fundamental divide between two sets of character ""twins."" Aaaugh! I'm so mad at myself. I can't remember who I showed this to, but whoever you are, if you'd like to IM me to hear the situation and give me advice, I would welcome it."

I had this dream that we were at the old LCBSC. The main lights were all off as they were at the staff retreat, but there was no one else there. We were wandering around playing with the foam fish, and hiding in the shipwreck, and visiting all the garrs and lampreys (who had had babies) and Tiger and Paisley and Bob and Clem and Luna. In the back room we left Stinky where he was, but took Cora out and let her poke around a bit, as she likes to. 

I can count on one hand the number of places in which I have felt so absolutely at home. (Let's see: CQ, LCBSC, and... to a certain extent ABC No Rio, I guess.) I love that even now that the building has been gone for so long (it was torn down for the Leahy thing in... was it 2000?) it still remains perfect in my mind. I remember every detail of every room, every terrarium and tank, every exhibit. In a way I miss the place, but in another way I feel like I could return and it would still be there, exactly as it was."

""Maybe birds will feel the air thickening as they fly deeper into themselves."" I've been sort of stuck on it in light of recent events. Although, I suppose, she had already decided on humanity.

In light of recent events -- ALL recent events -- I think I should leave. I feel like getting a tent and going to live in the cemetery. I'm so ready to graduate. Also, I feel a language kudos coming on. Ew. I really hope I'm wrong."

Jen M., I miss you. I don't have your cell phone number, and you very probably don't even read this, but if you do, could you give me a call? It's kind of random, I know, but would be really comforting to talk to someone sane, who isn't involved in this. I'll send you my phone number via e-mail.

"event","I was thinking about talking with Hell, about her word choice and her voice, the actual sound of it. I was thinking about Susanna, who has not one nerve in her, as far as I can tell. This isn't good enough. I read over something I wrote her in January and it's crap. A lot of things about the darkroom project are that way right now. I'll probably wind up fighting with it for a little while longer, then scrapping it and starting fresh.

I had a small surprise the other day when I saw Housman on campus, accross the green. I thought it was just crowding. Later I found out he'd actually been in the neighbourhood, doing some shopping. He looked great, but he's had work done. I saw him on CNN; he looked sixty.

The mag is having a comedy contest, and yesterday Brennan asked me if I'd be contributing. It's not that I have nothing funny... it's just that I have nothing that is funny in a way that a) other people will understand, and b) is appropriate for a school mag. I'm considering trying to do something for it, but I don't know how well it will work... I'll try, at least."

 - That essay
 - That girl, et cetera
 - That other girl... Ew.
 - That bad joke and my strange frame of mind last night
 - That uncle
 - THE SAME DAY
 - That French test
 - ""Nothing jiggles!"" (technically not this weekend, but so much in the spirit of it that I'm counting it anyway)
 - That laptop?!

I've managed to further corrupt someone more worldly than myself, possibly ruining her relationship with her boyfriend in the process... Yeah, I'm going to hell. I've had too little sleep (thank you, Amanda). I've aced a French retest after failing the first and not studying again. I've written an essay that makes no sense, but I can't be bothered to rewrite it... he won't read it anyway, though. Daylight savings time is killing my sense of <i>everything</i>. I'm learning Spanish (except that I forgot everything over the course of recent events), and I'm getting a laptop.

How the hell did all this happen? Why am I still alive when I am so utterly inept in all areas of life?"

Do senior cards
Sort out laptop nonsense

And then, while I was still sort of freaking out about that... we had a weird moment. And then I died. And then I went to meet Amy at the boathouse as though nothing at all had happened. 

This is one of the creepiest things that has ever happened. I almost wish Frankfurter were here to give me wholesome dickhead advice. God, I hate her.

Oh, well... Maybe it's a good thing. After all, if this is the only way to get rid of it, it should make things go considerably more easily... This is so disgusting.

I'm dying of happiness right now. I have absolutely no money, but I will take out student loan upon student loan if necessary in order to make this happen, because it is SO worth it.

"event","hi dudes. well i dunno y, but i feel slightly depressed currently. certain people have helped me realize that i dont have enough time just to think about life so i end up going nuts every once in a while. when it all comes to the surface. and i'm having a hard time writting songs....which is way depressing. i dont understand. i'm gonna go read my bible...since life is just at a stand still right now. l8r."

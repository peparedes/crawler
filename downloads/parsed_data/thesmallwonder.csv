It's a lot like it was a few years ago, big booths, sensory over load, but hmmm I guess really the big difference was that it was A LOT smaller then it used to be in its glory days. personally I liked it back in its glory days, it was a total blast. 

Anyways, I ran into&nbsp; a&nbsp; bunch of people I knew all throughout the day, which was awesome since I went there alone and figured my chances of running into people were small. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised and got to hang out witha&nbsp; bunch of differen't peeps all day :)

The coolest stuff I saw/played was the new Super Mario for the Wii, Punch Out for the Wii, the new Zelda game for the DS, and Little Big Planet (man i really want a PS3)

Soem othr cool stuff of note was, the new car racing game Split Second, which was surprisingly pretty and energy packed, the Batman Asylum game looks cool, and I really really want to play the new Assasins Creed.

I've heard rumor of some super mega cool 3D Virtually reality stuff being demo'd but i must have missed it &gt;:(

Oh well, I'm sure I'll be able to find it on youtube :D"

If you've lived in another country have you noticed a large amount of American news versus local/other country news available to you?

If you grew up some where other then the US do you find the amount of American based news/lingo used&nbsp; offensive or inconsiderate, lacking in some way?

And here's one for even the US residents on my F-list:

Do you keep up with the news, media, or even social networking sites (for the networking sites, they should be ones with a good international base), do you find the content to be primarily focused on one country or another. If so why do you think it is?"

"event","So I was reading an article that there is something of a commotion over Obamas Inauguration speech. The center for it being the word &quot;non-believers&quot;. Some religious groups apparently found it offensive to say that the country is indeed partly made up of non-believers and have that represented in his speech.

Being a non-believer myself I was thrilled to be acknowledge as part of this country. I vote, I pay taxes, I am a good person with good morals who tries to the best of my abilities to positively contribute to the country, differences set aside. I donate to organizations, religious or not so long as the cause is good, and the proceeds go where it should. I've been known to lend a hand with charity events here and there, or participate in a church bake sale if some one asks, even though I've attended church only twice in my life. I beleive in doing good because it is right.

Religion isn't a defining factor for me, it doesn't define my actions or my friendships in either direction. 

And because of this I am ignored publicly by my government. Because of this in my public school, which was supposed to be separated from the church, I was pulled into the principles office for refusing to say the Pledge of Allegiance when my teacher demanded I say &quot;One Nation under god.&quot; Because we are not One Nation under god, not anymore. 

So for one, little word, &quot;Non-belivers&quot; the man is scrutinized and nay-sayed. But I say thank you, and the other 48,611,942 non-belivers (16% of the last US populace count) say thank you too.

Thank you for seeing us, thank you for taking the first step. Thank you for acknowledging us as what we are. Citizens who are patriotic. Citizens who contribute to this country. Citizens who are a part of Americas past, present and future. Thank you."

(my mom and Xander helped!)<br /><br />I stuck them to the wall using special cube velcro that's mean to stick to cubicle walls. <br /><br />I have plans for a pull curtain door, a faux leather desk runner with brass gramets, and desk decorations that match eventually (maybe a vase and some bamboo, that type of thing). I may put down a throw rug, and get two black folding chairs (or maybe two of those small automans with the storage in them). <br /><br />"

Here's an excerpt from their intro post:<br /><br />&quot;Amerikkka takes place in a world where the various aspiring extremist ideologies of the American political scene at the end of the 20th century blossomed as the 21st wore on. Amerikkka assumes the worst of everyone, exaggerating the bad qualities and playing down the good to create a wild world of swirling intrigue and terrible stereotypes. This is a crudely offensive game that shouldn't be played by anyone who takes themselves or their politics too seriously.&quot;<br /><a href=""http://amerikkkagame.blogspot.com/""><br />So if you love politics, and table tops, check it out.

"event","Sooooooo...

I've been trying to order these Insperion Mini's that Dell has, and this is what I've been through:


Place order online through works member purchase programs, choosing standard customization items. Get told that its going to take them over a month to build these things. Conceed that they're a big company and I'll live without immediate gratification.... Never get my actualy confirmation e-mail with my order number. Call Dell to see what's up.

Guy sends me the confirmation and also fixes a typo in my billing address, everythings good to go.

Check order status online several days later, says order has been changed. Wierd! I didn't change my order! Call Dell.

Order has been canceled inital guy doesn't know why, but they say it has nothing to do with the billing address, and instead some customization on the order was invalid/incompatible. They put me on old to see whats up.

I get hung up on.

I call again, explain to new guy. I put on hold, for over 20 minutes, I assume I've been forgotten and hang up and call back.

This time I get transferred to a busy signal!

Call again... This time it's I'm on hold but the guy checks back with me often as he's getting long delays with the guy who can help me. He also says he's going to make sure my order goes in as priority to the factory and free over night shipping annnd and additional discount. he also apologizes for the poor service. I'm starting to feel better.

Finally get transferred to the guy who can help me. He says he can't figure out why in the world my order was cnaceled, everything looks good. He puts the order back in, and splits it into three orders just incase it being all cumped together is what confused the factory. I have sooner ship dates then before, except for my external drive which is oddly not coming till after chrismas, atleast I'll get the computers in novemember and less then a month. So I'm ok with that.

I check my bank account today, the money for the computers that was pending has strangely been put back into my account, no record of them havign tried to charge my account. I sense shinnanigans, since this is what happened last time they canceled my order.

I call dell.

I can only get the voice mail of the guy who called me before.

I call the main line.

The woman I get tells me my orders are still in production. I ask why they didn't follow trhough and charge my account, since last I checked it was pending and processing, and no mysteriously my account has not been charged. She does some checking and comes back with &quot;We'll charge your account when the items ship.&quot;

I tell her that there's no way I'm waiting till Nov 10th, then 24th, and then DECEMBER 26th for them to charge me for my orders, and that that's completely ridiculous. I placed my order, I want you to process my bill like every other company on the planet. She says she'll transfer me to the guy who originally helped me. I tell her I tried and got voicemail, and I want this taken care of now. She says she has to transfer me to him anyways and does.

I of course get voice mail. 

I leave a message and am now waiting.

Mainly waiting until I calm myself down enough to call back or he calls me. Either way, I'm taking care of this shit today. And if that means canceling my order, then too fucking bad.

EDIT**

I called back, they couldn't answer why they couldn't charge my account now or why the money to be taken out was pending. I asked them to transfer me to someone who answer those questions

put on hold for around 15 minutes. 
Transferred to someone speaking Spanish at me.
Then hung up on.

I'm going to call and cancel my order.

HP has something better for a similar price, so Dell can go to hell.

Second Edit:

The guy who originally helped me just returned my call. I told him that I had canceled my order and that there wasn't much he could help me with now.

He asked why i canceled. I explained that I didn't liek the fact that the charging of my account was reliant on th shipping considering that part of my order wasn't even going to ship until 2 months. 

He said &quot;That's standard?&quot; I said, that I'd had experince with other companies that would atleast charge my account all at once, and ship my items together, or charge my account before shipping. Also no one explained to me that that was dells policy.

He then said &quot;well if it was sucha&nbsp; great concern you would have checked&quot; and hung up."

My solution? Running after work. 

Its hard to get motivated to go after a long day of work followed by a crappy commute, but easier then getting up early, and it saves me more time.

I've also decided that if I slack off and decide not to go running, I have to do 30 minutes of DDR straight. Which turns out is MUCH harder then running 2-3 miles XD At least with 2-3 miles I can pace myself, where as DDR paces my movements for me, it doesn't care if I'm tired or want to slow down a bit."

"event","So first the good news lol: I went shopping today and got two really cute skirts, a new tank top, new shoes and two movies! It was fun chilling with my mom for once. :)

Now the bad news: When I left for the mall, I was in the BEST mood, because Jacko left me a little present in the form of a Usuki Paint Brush, so I sold it for 250k, doubling my NP. so I bought some stuff, and when I left I had about 450k in the bank which is the most I have EVER had. I come back from the mall, and my lab rat pet is gone, all of my money is gone but all of my items are still there, and my three other pets are still there. I flipped out a little, wrote to Neopets and figured it was some kind of glitch. I left again and when I came back, my password was changed and my lookup said this: <b>This Account Was Hacked By .:Master-Hacker:. Because The Person Using It Was Using A Money-Tree-Grabber; Np Cheating On Neopets Or I Will Hack Your Account, Too!</b>. Now if anyone could explain what a Money-Tree-Grabber is, I would appreciate it, because I have no recollection of ever using one. I guess I was hacked and that person used a money tree grabber or something. Im just really really really peeved because I had just finally gotten close to that  500k mark that I wanted, and those pets had serious sentimental value to me. And I cant figure out how this person got my password.

I made a new account, its xorangexstarx...neomail me if you'd like."

"event","Since no one who reads this knows me, I guess I better explain who Sam is before I get into my story. I had P.E. Class third term this year and Sam (who is a year older than me) was the volunteer for my class. We met, became friends, and he gave me rides home from school almost everyday. I became interested in him because he was not my type at all. He has long hair and loves video games, hes super laid back and doesnt care what people think of him. I normally go for the high-maintenance jocks, because I (admittedly) am High maintenance as well. So me and him got closer and closer, and at the same time he and my brother were becoming friends. So I told him some very extremely personal things about myself, that I trusted him with. He told my brother everything I said. This of course got Sam and I into a huge fight which went on for over a week of completely ignoring each other, when we both had feelings for each other. So we got over it, and he apologized and everything, but I found out from an unreliable source that he was talking shit about me behind my back. I yelled at him, and he got mad because he didnt do it. So Sam and I haven't spoken since January. 

I saw him walking in the hall yesterday and I was like ""good God, he is still gorgeous, I cant still have feelings for him tho, I have Ryan"" (Ryan is this guy that I am seeing, Im not that interested in him, but he is who everyone wants me to want, so I act it out.) And that very same day, he IMed me out of the blue and asked me why we dont talk anymore. I kinda got bitchy with him, then I apologized. 

I'm just really mad at myself because I do still like him, but I really don't need this right now. I would love some comments or advice, but I doubt anyone reads this."

So good for me, other than that I live with my homeboys, and it's just a grind. I realize as long as you don't succumb to your problems you'll be ok. Life is supposed to get hard for us that way we can show what we are really made of. You are only as real as what you come up aganist. I lost 40 family members in the past 5 years. SO you ought to know that I've been harden by my experiences, so of course I can relate to you or get down like you. On the same token you can't get down like me because you can't really relate to me. It's my momma's birthday and I love that woman with all my heart and I'll kill for her and the rest of my family straight up man. That's it for now
Love

"event","Hey you guys guess what I acutally have nothing to scream about but the fact that I was being stupid with my internet class and not really puttin up the effort I should be. That had to change, so don't be upset with me. Now, oops I lied how come ya'll will read the journal entries but don't write any kind of feedback. I get a notification if you write in it. So that's just a lil something to think about. I got to hang out with my mother's mother, my cousin, and her and son and boyfriend. It was a great weekend I saw my Uncle Waddell which is always a great time plus Uncle Charlie came into town. My cousin talked some sense into about how I was ducking Priscilla and avoiding the issues. Well I don't know what the future holds so I can not really make any plans. I just got a job at Furniture country so, I'll be slangin furniture for a while. I hear they make good money so I'm gonna get my hands on some of this. Right now I just want to make some money and chill out with my peoples. Because I am gonna try to start a business with all of my friends that I know a degree or some sort of expertise. Wait you'll see how rich I get with my A.A., because it's not what you know it's who you know. And if you don't know me you better get to know me because I'm comin for all the money out there. So all of ya'll who dissed me I got you. Back then nigga Mike Jones!!!"

"event","So anyway I am in the daily drama scuffle this person says this that person thinks that. I'll tell you what read this closely believe half of what you see and part of what you heard. Honestly I thought everyone was grown then I realized I'm the only sensible adult. That sucks because I'm still tryin to have fun. Nobody appreciates shit that I do. So I'm done fix your own plates and do your own shit. I am always tryin to get everybody out and about but nobody ever calls me and then it all falls squarely on me. I am tired of being stood up by people and then whole nine. I decided to just let them do them and me do me. Tom was right fuck tryin to help these niggas out man let them sort that shit out for themselves. I feel that no more shopping sprees no more late night creeps. I think it's time I put my 21/10 plan into effect. That's the only way I am gonna have shit. For every 10% you put in I'll put in 21% so do the math and while you're putting in 110% I'm gonna put in 231%. And then after that is all said and done I am gonna get another job and bust my ass there and go to school. Right now I want to travel. So I figure I'll start local Jax, Tampa, ORL, Miami, all of these areas, but when I say that I mean do it big no more of this lil nigga ballin. No more small parties, no more bullshit. I woke up this morning and decided that all the bullshit of yesterday has no bearing on what I do today. Just grind and hustle. I'm gonna get a newer nicer car than most of you have seen in a long time. I'm gonna get all A's in my classes. Right now I am only concerned about 2 things. Where I live Aug 8th, and what I do for my birthday. I'm not going to waste my money on a party and get everyone else fucked up for free. I'm also not gonna get a bunch of kegs and charge people. I am gonna get my ass on a plane and fly to Las Vegas, and I don't give a fuck who comes with me hell I'll fly dolo. Matter of fact I'll do everything dolo if I need to. I can escape on foot faster with one person than 2. I don't care about covering ground. You're gonna get real intimate with me soon girl. I don't care if you look read and laugh because you know when I tighten these reins shit happens. When I really decide to do something I do it. I'll make you take me seriously, I'll scare the shit out of you. I've been called a sociopath by Priscilla so I'll be that. I'll be cut-throat, gutter, and all that nasty shit you don't want me to be. All in the name of my bar. I'm gonna open a nice bar. And it's gonna turn money over and over and over again for me. I'M GOING TO BE RICH. Not because I say so because it's in my lineage nigga. I got a hustla spirit nigga period. Yeah all my shit is madd old right now and yours is brand ass new. Good for you wait til you see my flat screen. Wait til you see me truck. Wait til I get another toaster and another and another and one more. Yep 5 including the one nobody thought I should have. 6 if you count the one I've always had. Anyways I am back on the Benz wagon so when I get ready to take these tests don't hate me. I'll bet I change your mind when them 96's come rollin up on that Denali. The biggest hold-up in the history of the world is about to happen. You'll read about or hear about. And see it. Damn why ya'll got this lil nigga started?..."

"event","Yo first of all this journal entry is gonna cost me something. I don't kmow yet but please believe it ain't gonna be much. Because I am gearing up for the backlash. Some of the women walking the streets are stupid. Some of women walking the streets are bitches, hoes, scandlous, trife, selfish, greedy, and then finally the good ones. Well I'll tell you what working at Crispers has taught me alot of things. Whatever your girl wants to do B she's gonna do it. I've seen girls take drastic measure to hide things from their boyfriends or husbands. Girls who are taken will flirt back too. For instance we'll call this one the cookie chick. So I was working in cookies for like 10 minutes to cover a smoke break for someone and then it was back to the lobby. Well this girl came up and started winking and smiling at me. None of that means anything because that's the sign for what can I work this nigga over for. So I play along (Dave I see where you are coming from with everything man.) She starts talking to and I start giving her a hard time because that's all I'm good for at work. Anyways I tell her that I'll break her off some free cookies (She fell for it.). She actually thought that this random guy was gonna just give her cookies for nothing. Silly ass broad! Well anyways I wasn't tryin to get a number I just leave a mark. So she goes out to the patio and then she walks in on the arm of some cat and he's like thanks man for the cookies take it easy. As soon as he looks away his girl is beggin me to act like I don't know her and she is smiling and winking and whispering thank you. Another time this girl really thought she served me. At work I talk to everyone and if you're good looking or good smelling I'll tell you so. Balls to the wall we could all die tomorrow and I'd be one of the happy ones. This one girl I talked to for 10 minutes and broke her off proper discounted meal and the whole nine cookies like word. So I decided to see what Gordo is made of, Gordo handles his like a real nigga should. I say Gordo get the number for me because I gotta clean lobby. He come back and is like ""Yo she says drop dead."" I laugh instantly and he keeps his straight face for 5 minutes while I am coughing and slapping my knee. So he finally tells me she says ""I'm not her type."" A.K.A. too dark. But she tried to give Gordo her number ooooh! Anyways he was like nah I don't think the girlie would like that. And she walks out with a red face. Don't test us. I'm realer than you think. I don't tell you shit because too much little shit happens on a daily basis for me to write about it and a few people read it a few don't so what does it matter anyway. First of all a nigga don't work for ya'll. So shut that shit up. Second there are a few good women out there but the same thing has happened to them. Some ole fake ass nigga gave her a hard time or abused her. And now she is rock hard. She lets no one in and then when she finally does it's too late. If you ain't a celebrity the only security you need is your social. All of these defense mechanisms do is slow the forward progress. So while you are being with the guy you really like he is losing interest in you. Shit somebody gotta let ya'll know because ya'll think every nigga want ya'll. Bitch I'm friendly and leave it at that. Don't think that just because I am introducing myself means I wanna marry yo stankin ass or monkey ass. That's the problem. Ya'll see niggas comin and start actin all flimsy. I see niggas do it all the time. The 2 hottest female in this hick ass town I know, and they used to tip me $5 everytime they dealt with me. They told my manager great things about me. All I did was act normal, I wasn't on no ya'll some supermodel type shit. They were 2 ordinary girls just like the rest of ya'll. Ok so don't sit there and think you are high and mighty and look over the dude in front of you and to the sides of him. Because when you go to talk to the nigga you really like he's gonna do you the same way. Try it and see. I'm so good I'm dating Kharma right now and no she's not a bitch. We had a threesome with Reality and she doesn't bite all the time. I'll tell you what though Ya'll changed me. Now I got nothing to give you but jokes and advice.
It's a celebration bitches enjoy yoselves...
Oh yeah I'mma throw a mega party with Gordo and police the door with E-Block how u love that. Davis Industries thank you, you gave me life and I know you will protect forever more once we work out the kinks of this deal. Later on today I'll write more. Right now I am going to bed to get my zzz'z pimp.
I'm changed I don't care either you in the game on the bench no more substitutions.
Yes I'm worth it all too.

OJ's gonna get a burner so watch your back cuz then I'll be at the range workin on my aim. I think that a lot of women that I have are scandlous ass bitches. Straight up and down. So the next time I see you in the streets you are going to have to keep me entertained. I am no longer the village idiot.

I am about to take a conquest that I have been needing to take for the past maybe 2 months. I am going to give up all my vices for a month. Yes I mean all of them. Starting Tuesday for 30 days I am going to drink water and milk and eat healthy and work out and run and the whole nine. I decided today that I wanted better for myself. When you break it down my time is worth more than think. I am going to just chill out on spending and everything because I have a goal. I want a new car straight up. I want a 2000 Yukon or a Denali. I am going to switch jobs after my 30 days and then start saving up to get my truck. I am going to put a very nice system in it. Oh yeah and goal #2 is to get a burner. I'm going to start off with a smitty and then upgrade. I am going knock out these classes for summer and school and I am never going to summer school again. The teachers are Nazis I promise. I have never been more throughly disgusted with teachers in my life. Wise-asses are what they are. But it's cool right now is my trying time. I am put in these type of positions to become a better person. You are only as real as what you come up against and most of ya'll ain't shit. Walk a mile in my shoes and then tell me what your problems are. I am going to do it. I have said it time and time again but when you see me in my new whip. Hell I might not get it I might get a Dodge truck. Yeah right I'll get it. It'll be Black and tinted with a tv or 2 or 3 and some nice rims to match.

I am working on graduting and transferring fromt his hell hole. FAU, UCF, or USF here I come. I am pro-ing and conning it all right now to see which school has better programs for their money. Right now FAU because they have a weekend bachelor's program that allows me to work full time and make money while in school it take 20 months and I will grad with 2 degrees. I don't see where UCF or USF offer that type of program. Anyway I am ready to get out of this town. It is full of fake ass people, drunks, liars, bitch ass niggas and bitch ass niggarettes, and generally people who you think are right in the head and they are just plain shot out there. I am so sick of you big headed muthafuckas tryin to ruin my day. That's why I am going to get out of here and go to another town with either a beach or a lot of shit to do because the people here that I have met so far are ass. The only niggas I hang out with are niggas I went to middle school and their boys and my nigga Jarrod from work. Man I'll say fuck most of Crispers(Minus my managers because they come thru heavy for me.) . Right now all of you sell out muthafuckas who think you are bad ass or good looking shut the fuck up. I really don't care what you think...especially about me. We never have to speak again. Oh yeah and if I didn't see you this weekend definately fuck you unless you were out of town other no excuses. People who can read this and we don't talk this isn't for you. But a few of you just keep away from me. I hate fake people and I find a new one a day. I call people and they don't call me back that's cool man. Kiss my ass when you see me. I don't hold grudges I'll just never talk to you again. I told you what the deal was and now you want to think you are above it. Fuck you you big headed bitch. LMAO fam you gotta forgive me she tried us hard and nobody's gonna play me close. If you got a man good for you. Don't expect me to respect that. OK? I will not give a damn who your man is unless that nigga pays my bills to. I'm I need to get away from Crispers because people who work and eat there are big headed and I hate a big headed nigga fa sho. P.S a nigga can be a boy or girl. Just because a nigga shows you the time of day don't make it cool to get all hottie tottie. First off Nigga you never called me but at work you on my tip heavy. Talkin all this shit about a party and now you think you some hot shit. Well you are hot shit like a hot turd that someone just dropped. Case Closed. I am stopping again tonight. for a while. Only real niggas know what that means. It'll be a small ceremony with my closest niggas. I reached out to the wrong people this weekend. I realized that I called the wrong people. and they didn't call me back. So you're on time-out little Tyke. Half my phone is on time-out. It's either that or change my number. I'll disrespect the nigga that gets outta line right now I promise. On my life I will not be disrespected again. Oh wait I checked her ass Yesterday. She saw me the next day and was like damn I thought this nigga was a clown. Sunday was a great day. If you missed the start of Sunday morning I'll maybe jog yor memory. But other than that

"event","Ok here the toughest thing about life. Lying... No matter how real you are I think everyone lies here and there to protect people. Because no matter what you lie so that unneccessary fights don't break out and people don't get their feelings hurt right? Yeah it's all good until you gotta tell the other person the truth and they ae like so you were lying the whole time? Well I guess some people lie to put off the inevitable. Or some people just lie to make the inevitable materialize. I don't know why people lie. I used to do it a lot back in the day. Then I got tired of it so I just started to duck situations that I just did not want to be in. I'd not answer calls but I guess at some point when a lit gets old you just decide to give it up.
My next question I pose is when you abandon a sinkin ship. Some parts of life are like the Titanic (all luxurious and shit then shit happens) and everyone goes to a life boat some people drown in their problems. I guess I am just built for all of mine. I have never met a problem in life not math or science that I couldn't solve. I just had to step back a look at things logically. If something is not good for you I guess logically you should abandon it. Because it will take you under. If you ever notice no one gets away with anything anymore. All of those murders from the past and people who committed crime eventually get caught because their conscience. You can not live with all of that shit on your chest cuz. I've tried it. If you smoke anything period it will react to whatever you are holding in and physically sicken you. Take it from a pro let it go. I have held grudges aganist people for long periods of time. Now I am older and wiser. I just stay away until the storm clears. People hate it. You want to piss a person off these days just avoid their asses. Unless they are in your class. My friends avoided me once and twice, but I tell you this much. Those of you who have left me in the cold the locks have changed this time you are like fred flintstone outside the door. I think the coolest shit I can remember doing was making soundtracks to my life. When I lived in the Murphree Dorms at UF I would smoke and drink and have a great time. Then I would make a cd from the songs that we were listening to at that time so that I would have the memories. Well my second year of college was a blast so my cd collection exploded. But now I look back and I see that it worked so when I look at this journal years from now I will see what I went through, my likes and dislikes and hopefully it will help me grow up even more. Getcho Shine On"

"event","Ok like I promised I will give you non-listening single guys the math. Before you go out shower, damn so many dudes just go to a bar sweaty and stank as hell and they are always the ones who are always at the bar with theur arms up ordering drinking. Right Guard Cool is a lifesaver. I've been using that and it's Gilette counterpart. If this stuff doesn't work then you are extremely too hairy. Which also brings up a point of mine shave body hair. Trim it or something shampoo it damnit. I am always in the mirror trying to rid myself of excess body hair. What you fail to realize is those hairs that have been growin on your sweaty balls are older than your homeboy's lil brother by a few years. Let some fresh ones grow in or wax that shit. This one is for my favorite friends my white boys. Please do not be afraid of low cit ankle socks females love them. Trust me I sold them to them all day they think they are sexy. Why so white boys wear shin socks and running shoes with shorts? And why are ya'lls laces soo damn tight? It just looks uncomfortable. Now to my favorite cologne. Please embrace cologne. Even the people with the lowest self-confidence can get a conversation sparked by a female asking what are you wearing. Guys at least treat yourself to a few different mid to high end or even $20 bottle from walmart. Name brand only don't buy that cheap shit you are only wasting your money. Keep your haircut. Everytime you get a haircut I bet you feel 12 times more pimperish. I know trust me I do. I can leave the barbershop looking so bummy but when I change I get those ""Wow he takes care of himself looks."" I love it when I get smiled at. Because it shows you a sense of admiration. It's an acknowledgement like a silent ""Good Job"". I know all of this seems crazy. I know no one reads this because no one responds to this. But at least I get it off my chest here right? Wrong I talk about this shit with different people everyday. So I am not the only person who thinks like this. Fellas I am just trying to help. Now here a good topic. Soap I used to be a fraid of the loofah. Now the loofah is on point. I replace it everyone month. Get you some good ass soap. I like the Suave body soap. The different scents they have seem to work for me. I feel brand new after each shower. But you want to know what really pulls it all together? Confidence! You can have any lady that you want if you believe that you can. Trust me. I know I have persisted and persevered through several eras. I will tell you this though. If you can make a person laugh you have a friend for life. I guess that is why I get along with so many people and people love to chill with me. I am non partisan. I don't sit there and judge people by what's on the outside. I don't care what my friends from back home think of you. Because if we cool and you cool then my friends will like you. My friends are like dogs. They smell fear they wanted to bite a few of my friends then I realized I am gonna give up my dog or a friend? I got a dog for life or a fair weather friend. I'm the flickiest. I am more than happy to talk to people so if anyone ever reads this and needs someone to talk to. If you put in the math to get a hold of me I'll help you through whatever you are going through. I am a grown up. I support my self, I love myself so I don't need other people to love me to be happy. I've been this way even before I had friends and through the periods when i had no friends. I've seen it all. If you want to be a good friend to a person. Shut-up, don't judge people and just decide is this person bad for me to be around? Do they bring me down? Are we good for each other and can we laugh our asses off when we are sober? If it's a a yes to the good then you got a friends and vice versa well people that's my time
I hope this informate helps at least one person live a better life cuz if it does then i did my job...

"event","I'm back with a new rant. People are ungrateful... No matter how much you give them most people are not willing to give you what you give them. And it takes people like seven years to heed advice that you give them. It is just amazing at how stupid the people that I used to associate with have become. I look at these people and I just want to sic their oldself on them to see if they are as tough now as they were back then. I remember a time when it was all about having a great time. Now that people got a few dollars here or there they think that they are the shit. I remember a time when almost everybody hung out with me. Trust me it's not like I am begging for a person to chill with me now because I got plenty of people to smoke with and drink with and go to clubs and bars with I have always been that way. David Solomon said one that about me that the most true. I get over people really fast. You wanna know why. Because people don't know how to to hold on to who they are. One day they are so into you and all in your ass and then poof they disappear. And you be like what the fuck did I do. Well guess what I ain't do shit and I ain't doin shit. So the next topic why do people smoke punk ass cigarettes? Marlboro Lights are not real cigarettes Get you a real cigarette that comes in a real one color cigarette box. Like red or green not taupe. Those queer eyes colors. I tried to stop smoking but then I realized I just take breaks to recover. Oh yeah I don't really need anybody in Gainesville to have a good time. If left to my own devices and roommates or just colleagues from work. I don't need to get fucked up. I am happy with like 2 heinekens. Next point! Don't drink cheap beer females can tell when you are a cheap person by the drinks you drink fellas. You want the math I'll give it to you right now..."

Artist: Jadakiss f/ Nas
Album:  Kiss Tha Game Goodbye
Song:   Show Discipline
Typed by: Animlthg99@aol.com

[Jadakiss]
Yoooo!!
uh, uh-huh, uh

Yo yo yo yo aiyyo
Never will it stop
Hanguns with double digit shots
I move work on other niggas blocks
Leave out the club wit a another niggas watch
Body that man and let other niggas watch
Only thing worse than a coward, is a coward with power
Gotta kill him in the shower, hour
Beats is knockin, hooks is rare
Earned my spot, nobody aint put me here
Burnt my block, I had a fiend cookin wit beer
Like the Bobby Womack of crack
Might see me in the burgandy thing, or the black on black
Matter of fact, go get ya chrome
Cause I rather be, broke together than rich alone
Clappin em' down, backin em' down (uh)
Fuck what ever happened before, I'm whats happenin' now

[Chorus: Nas (Jada)]
Now gangstas live, gangstas die
Grab ya guns, soldiers ride (show discipline nigga!)
Kill ya moms, kill ya pops, kill ya seed
Kill ya girl (Its principle nigga!)
Sell ya crack, sell ya coke
Sell ya E, sell ya smoke (you hustlin nigga!)
Grab ya nine, grab ya pound
Grab ya tec, grab ya pump (you bustin at niggaz!,wha)

[Nas]
We bravehearted, I had bitches tryin to posion me
Niggaz who kilt loyalty
Set me up, vested up my move accordingly
I ducked icepicks and icesticks by cops who rookies
Hard to be righteous, and when life can just stop for pussy
Niggaz killin over hoes, guns concealed in their clothes
Bodies at funerals, touch them they feel like they froze
Speech, totally calm, holdin dead rappers dome in my palm
Burnin flag, plus its on the qu'ran, its on the bible
Plus america cause that every car thats drivin
Holdin the homeless sign you focus you know its Nas then
Prince of the globe, leave no prince of the toast
Played with Ouija boards, burned frankencense wit a ghost
I've learned, to do good plus a waste of evil
And do what it takes to keep a smile on the face of my people
I was raised by the apes in this dark creepshow, but yo

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
yo yo yo yo yo yo
Think bout when I splatter ya mask(yea)
My niggas is happy, ya momma is sad
If ya niggas is riders, the drama will last
If ya niggas is snitch, been judgin my ass
They said I'm too famous to run
So when I empty out this clip, I'm changin the gun
The realer the beef, the longer the clip
Murder ya mans, I'm gone in the mist
Call this girl after dark so we talked the bitch
We aint care cause the whore wasnt shit
Doll, I aint takin the L or waistin a shell
I bring the heat like I'm satan itself
Fuck if you hard, fuck if you soft, long as you lost
Dick in the dirt, shit in ya drawers
Ill make ya grandmother get on the floor
Tie you up, then beat you to a pulp, say that this is a war
If'n the four, mackin a pump, actin I dump
Throw you out the window then act like you jump

[Chorus 2x]

OK I get it I get it... Wow the lightbulb just came on. I have been way too stupid for way too long. The signs where apparant but I chose to avoid them. Write this down... You can tell a lot about a person from their integrity. This is how I know integrity I hear it is simply what you would do if no one is around. Merriam-Webster describes integrity as completeness and honesty. So I'm gonna be honest. This is bullshit I have not been myself for a while. When younger people say,""Oh you don't know what love is."" I think that is because they don't know what love is. I know what love is believe me cuz. I can tell you it is when you let a person be completely naked with you. Not in the sense of having on clothes or not but when you sit there and you let it be what it is. Take me or leave me people are afraid to say these days. No one is really honest. Imma tell you something else I used to laugh when people said I'm tired of hiding my secret life or I can't do this anymore. Aunt Bernice you were right, eventually the charade plays out the band leaves and it is just that person. Undercovers, cia agents, fbi, kgb all of people I used to laugh at because I was like what do you mean. I saw an episode of Will & Grace... (Stop thinking I am gay I am not nor is this a form of coming out!) I repeat.(Stop thinking I am gay I am not nor is this a form of coming out!) But you do get tired of hiding or being hidden. I am real everyone around me tell me that because I will really tell you what's going on in my head. Sometimes I have to censor that for public consumption. That is what they call in the music business being mainstream or commercial. I never thought of life this way until now. Everyone take a look at yourself, and write down how you used to be 5-7 years ago. Now draw line and a name for each person and event that changed you until you have a box. Now erase those lines and be yourself. Damn I'm good that'd why I don't need to go to pysche class because it is all bullshit. You let those people change you. You get it? We are in Gainesville right? if you are not from here then that means when you go to your hometown you are not the same person get it? Therefore Gainesville make you fake? See this is why druggies are cool because they are who they are. You can dis people who will do a line in front of you but I mean damn they had the balls to sit there and take out there cocaine and make and line and do a rail in front of you. It don't get any realer than that or does it? See this is my conclusion. It's ok to be yourself if people don't like you for yourself then they can not be allowed to change you. Self perservation naturally I mean write this shit down. I am a critically acclaimed bad speller mis/self educator who is spilling the guts of a great self help novel to you with out the small/smoove fee are ya'll niggas fellin me or what? I hope you are paying attention. I realized I have been myself for the past 5 years. <---Period no pun intended. I was always doing what I do. Let's go back. I smoked weed with everyone, I drank alcohol with everyone, I clowned and dissed everyone and get dissed by everyone. See nothing ever goes away espeically pain. Shit just because comfortable or as we say you'll live or you can live with it. Now I've lost about 30-35 family members in the past 5 years. Damn cuz that's like I lose 5 or 6 family members in my life each fuckin year. Let that shit soak in yo muthafuckin dome bitch. Now take along ass look at me. I cry shit I'm a human but don't ever let no nigga or no bitch change you and that's what I'mma tell my kids. Because in essence that was the message my parents conveyed to me. And I'm givin it to yo monkey ass cuz I think you need it. I changed. I changed alot but narrowly. I would dis my friends for girls. My roommates showed me something that I had hidden. The ability to look in the mirror and say I choose you first. Because at the end of the day before I go to to bed that same day I look at that same person. I was in car and I heard DMX say, ""Which would you have 10 you found or 5 earned?"" That same day this girl who worked before me was leaving and she took her tips and was about to leave so I put a dollar in the jar because I was gonna keep it. First I thought about keeping it. I did then I put it in there and she took it. I was pissed naturally, somebody actually had the balls to take something from me that was theirs somewhat. For a minute I felt liked a robbed drug-dealer because nobody was gonna do anything. And then DMX came into my head and said, ""Which you rather $1 you found or the $45 you earned?"" So I went head and said a prayer and gave them my best. I'm good I don't need to tell you everything anymore. I talk too much. I realized nobody listening anyway... Listen to people like N.O.R.E. David Banner(One part of Crooked Lettaz remember Firewater), T.I.P, because the people who don't sell madd units are the best units because corrupt them. Look at everyone on T.V. everyone with mad videos change they are not like that in real life. Because essentially you get a will change for and incentive. Being real doesn't pay much unless you're Dr. Phil. Fuck him listen to Styles P or Trick Daddy, Pastor Troy somebody who ain't platinum leave that shit alone. Be who you are because that's all you got."

"event","Man sometimes it just gets too loud in your head and people try to talk to you when you are thinking about some important shit and for that I have this to say, ""Get out my face nigga!"". But whatever I am happy again I am workin at my job that I like especially when I get good tips, but any tips is better than no tip. Man everything is workin out, Doc is headed out of Iraq thank God. School is goin good I just am sick of wakin up at 8 am damn damn damn mane. Next semester I am not getting outta bed until like 8 am cuz I get that good pay so i'll shut up. I have no need to complain. If my life and finances keep going this way I'll be able to do what I want and say I did it my way. I talked to my grandfather by letter for the first time in like almost 3 years yeah that's some shit. I gotta write some more letters to some people that I love and I realized have loved me since I was a lil kid. I am too busy to call but I am going to take the time to call these people because they mean more than just this much to me. God bless everyone I hope everybody is doin good. Congrats Steph you prolly won't know about this for a long ass time. I am never online and most people don't even know that I have a live journal. I have to write in this journal because I can be as negative as I want to be and no one can tell me shit. I can talk however I want and no one will holfd me accountable for my actions or beliefs. So if you ain down wit me then get out my face nigga. That's my word tit for tat. I'm sick of people not seeing what I am really worth to them. Fuck you I am arrogant deal with it. Once again it bounces off of hollowed walls. I can yell in here it is soo non-partisan. I needed this session it is something like cloud comin out of my lungs. I just think that at this point in my life I just need ears. I don't need to people to tell me what I am doing wrong anymore. I know how bad my shit is. OK I am doin this straight path I owe it to my father. Thanks Ma for having my back. You came through for me in a major way without you I'd be in the bottom of a bottle at the Ocean Deck or somewhere like that. Now I am in school puttin the wood to these classes. Stop sayin the pimp peons real pimps will slap the shit out of you. I think you people need to stop frontin like ya'll boss hoggs or something like that. I really wish I had some congeniality award to hand out for you silly ass people. Once again I am forced to re-interate the fact that bitch we in Gainesville, FL. Ok this is the most remote largest non-metro city in the state. Why are you walking around with a prada bag nobody gives a fuck. All of you girls out there who think you are the shit you need to smell your shit. Yes it stinks like the rest of the world. You think you are soo much better than everyone else who goes to the same college as your stupid ass. I love it people look at me and say well you go to Santa Fe like I am supposed be embarrassed. Are you nuts do you not read the Alligator I think I have less shit to worry about as in my college stickin a dick in my ass. HAHAHA Bernie Machen is all for himself when UF is whiter than Havard and there is no diversity I hope you all are happy. There will be no more cool black people like me for you fuckers to open up to. On that note when you all hit it big or reflect on your life remember this one line, ""Who put this shit together... me that's who!""
Later On
P.S.
Go get all 3 T.I. cd - I'm Serious, Trap Muzik, and Urban Legend and tell me he ain't better than alot of artist out there. And Miri Ben Ari is makin waves her cd is gonna be hot."

"event","Well that day has come and so has the time... The one day you wake up and realize that you are an adult. When did you first wake up and say I am a grown-up and everything that I do from this point on has a direct link to how my future will turn out? Mine will be coming up on a week ago and I am thankful that it happened this way. How many of you out there are totally independant right now? I mean as in you car your car insurance? Not a lot huh, but you walk around like you are some big shot. That's what makes me laugh. It's like a lot of people I meet and see walking around this city are wearing depends... the diapers for grown-ups. When will you realize that just because they don't have a shirt in the size and color you want it is not the end of the world? It is more serious than that. Frankly you are as real as what you come up against. That is my credo because most people have not experienced hard times. The loss of loved ones will separate you from the crowd and also the experience of personal tragedy will make you rise from the ashes. Basically what I am saying is that if your parents are steering your lifeboat you need to cut the umbilical cord as my father used to say and get out there into the real world and experience real life. Yeah yeah everyone has an apartment these days. But mostly because the community colleges don't haeve dorms and it was the cool thing to do. Or mommy and daddy said it's time for you to find your own way. I understand that it may seem harsh but my children will not be spoiled. It makes for a sorry person. Sorry as in lazy and wanting everything handed to you. A lot of people I know have soft hands, that comes from not ever having to bust your ass. I am not talking about the people who are given large amount of money for college because your brain earned you that. I mean just chicks prancing around with Louis Vittuion purses and Christian Dior bags and haven't done shit. I mean those hoes make me sick. They are impolite and they have no manners. One days bitches somebody is gonna check your ass. Trust me it ain't about the money baby. It's just business, I've met a lot of people on my travels and journeys and I have realized that it's some sorry as people floating around the city of Gainesville. They want you to think that they come from money which really means nothing because if your money comes from your parents then it's not your money. I have met people who tell me what cars their parents drive and I ask them what are you driving they say a new honda I'm like so what does your parent's mercedes? You don't have one! Well anyway my point to this entry was that some people are just down right bitch-made but I understand when you come from pampered households. I'll tell you this much I am coming up and soon and very soon you'll see what I mean..."

"event","I'll tell you all this much, all of you out there looking for happiness in material things... you are setting yourself up for failure. There is no happiness in any thing that you have to pay for really trust me. So you mean to tell me you are happy after you bust your ass working and putting up with your boss' shit you want to go and waste your money on a pair of $150 sneakers or boots or shit like that. Here's an idea for you. Go to the bank the money and and look at it. Hold it in your hands look at how much your time is worth. Isn't it grand that you put up with other's people shit and problems for that much money. When you graduate from college that just means to paid someone money to teach you how to put up with other people's shit and of course a few life skills. Let me tell you this. My grandfather who I don't really talk is real as fuck. He puts up with nothing from no one. He owns his own business so when you walk in there you sit your ass down in an old rickety ass chair and then you tell him what you think you want. And then he gives you what you think you need plus a good kick in the ass. Now as aa kid I used to be like damn that person ain't never comin back. Riight they's be back with their friends and family and he'd do the same shit over and over again. I was like how this man is fa sho wit it. He will do whatever you ask him.

"event","Since I am experiencing technical difficulties with the live journal posting I will make sure I copy everything I write. A good friend of mine was talking about how the government has no money to fund research for various illness and ailments. That's because all the damn money is being spent fighting a war on terror. Last time I checked online I didn't find a home address for Osama bin Laden when I looked online so why the fuck are wasting money to find this guy. If anyone reads this watch Wag the Dog with Robert Deniro and maybe you'll see the world through my eyes. People come out of the Bushes!! Don't you realize that nothing is going to get better because he was re-elected? He is going to finish what he started. Let's start with the obvious the economy? These reports are released by the government they show that Bush has managed to raise the deficit through the roof. People talk about John Kerry but I mean hands down he is a better human being than president Bush. How fucking stupid are you people to re-elect him look at him. All he does is people then turn them down. Is it easy to get a job these days? Fuck no it ain't easy maybe it is overseas where you can get a tax cut because shipped much needed jobs over there. I am so glad I have a live journal because if i could get this shit off of my chest i would've keeled over a while ago. I know my shit don't get read but just so I can say I got this shit off of my chest feels soo good. Why are we in Iraq? Give me on good answer that justifies my friends and family members and the friends of others to go get oil. Don't you realize that all bush does is line the pockets of him friends?! Why do rich people need tax-cuts? They should be paying 3 times as much taxes as everyone else. They got billions of dollars to throw away on 3 and 4 houses and there are people who don't have shit not even a pot to piss in. I would open a shelter that helped get the homeless off the street, educated and into the work force. Because for everyone person who has a job is a taxpayer. I would love to see Hollywood stop buying Rolls-Royces & Bentleys with our hard earned money on $1000 hotels rooms and start taking up the burden of the poor. They think because they donate money to charity it help people. Build a house that can hold a few hundred people, hire people to teach them vocational skills and technical skills and get them into the workforce. Help them get their kids fed and educated to stop the cycle from perpetuating itself. That way they can have more people take up the tax burden. The top 10% own 75% of the nation's wealth. I know it's not fair for a person to pay more for something because they are rich right? But logically it is. If that many people use your product then you should be held responsible for coming up with some shit that good. That's my thinking imagine of all of the wal-marts were helf accountable for all that shit they sell and take back after years of use and abuse. I say this I may never run for president but if I ever get on T.V. I am going to raise hell. And say fuck such and such and the president and his whole cabinet. They are a bunch of fuck-ups. All they do is make their friends rich. Bill Clinton was a great presidente because he actually made progress in the world. Bush never even met with Yasser Arafat and now he died what's his excuse. now there'll never be peace over but in closing
Fuck Bush and all of his friends and people who agree with his dumb ass too all the way down the line. And if you are a minority and you voted for him fuck you in the ass."

I look back at the people who supposedly had my back. They are the one who call you and try to act like they are your friends. Talking about you wanna hang out. I think it's time to leave Reggie alone. We started out with him but if you still down with Reggie you ain't on my level. You can tell alot about a person just by looking at what they smoke and the shoes they wear. Timberlands, Newports, and Mids. That's just how life it. Air force Ones are still cool but you can't wear them with linen pants. Just like friends, people who are wearing the same clothes from the day you met them it's time you let them go just like your high school jeans. My pops passed away a few years ago. I miss him alot but I am on a mission. My goal is to be the richest person you ever met in your life. I am not your free source of entertainment. I'm selling jokes now nigga what! Your party ain't shit if I ain't there. Ain't nobody laughin at you jokes. You a bullshit ass soft serve cone. I'm a Blizzard even if you a frosty or a McFlurry you can't fuck with me. Wow you got loafers I got Diesels. You think just because you get paid more than me or you are about to graduate your life will end better than mine. Bitch back-up I need elbow room. Wow you a newer car than me I got jokes that would cost more than that. Ohh you got a bunch of associates I got niggas that'll shoot yo ass and walk away. Now you feel me. Damn I got this channeling shit down. I know how to squeeze the creative juice out your lemons. I got four books that I am ready to write. Aw Damn OJ got loose and you can't prosecute him. I would just like to say if you voted for bush you deserve to be in Fallujuah right now instead of my brother. Hey did you hear the one about the guy who retired from the Army 8 years ago and was re-activated? Damn how many more soldiers must die for gas to be cheaper? When will it all be over? Now we got them in a state of emergency it ain't good be in that shape. Man ya'll better watch for the fall-out I'll be in Amsterdam judging the Cannibis Cup

Man o man. Sometimes you just gotta tell people what the business is like your bosses for instance. Sometimes I have to tell them to do it theyself yes asses theyself now go tell webster what's i'm to his dictionary. Anyways why do people constantly get on your nerves and ask you to shit that they know you don't wanna do, but when you wanna do something it's you're on your own Malone. I hate that shit. That's what i hate. that's why i stopped donating my time to lame ass people. #2 what about the people who always ask you what you doin tonight and never be like yo let's do somethin or let's go cause trouble. if you know me you know it's 2 things i'm always game for. teachers who are very sympathetic deserve apples everyday or hot 18 y/o to keep our grades up. I hate teachers who are always like you could have went to the library and if you don't have a car then ride the bus and if you don't have money how can you afford to keep making these excuses. They are just pissed off cuz their teacher gave them the stick when they were hippies. total buzzkill bro. Can we please retire a few words. Bling-Bling, Bro, Homie unless you say it in a flicky manner. Umm Phat, Dude's 21 gun salute is years past due Dude!! If you can think of some other shit that people shant say post it Cuz!

Football players are stupid?! that's the dumbest line I've ever heard because how many people you know get paid millions for 16 weeks of work? you call them stupid? now that's just plain hate. i think teachers should make millions but none of them are really worth it. ok a few but now all of them. that is why they get paid so little. but anyways man I am soo tired of hearing people whine and complain about how bad their life is. peep this bitches my daddy died 2 years ago. do you still have a daddy to hug? hug him and kiss his ass for making you the person who you are. stop thinking that people live forever. ya'll better start tellin muthafucka that ya'll love them because when they are dead they don't talk back...

"event","Man I think I found a way to do good in my school. Force myself!!! It sounds simple doesn't it? Yeah well what people fail to realize is that if everything were so easy or easy as they sounded than do you think we'd have problems? If life was easy for people do you think Oprah would be rich or Jerry Springer would be popular? Hell no! We need problem or road-blocks to test us and make us become the people we need to be. I think I have unlocked my true inner-anger. Unfortunately it took me away from reading but I'd rather stop reading and clear my head of all my thoughts and then be able to read with nothing to stop me. First of all I use the fact that the main reason I exist in this city is because I wanted to attend UF and now that I am not there anymore and everyone I work with goes there or has graduated from there or another college tends to piss me off so I work harder. It is not jealousy. Don't get twist my words herb! I think that wanting something is what makes all of us focus. I want a GMC Yukon I will have 1 in January or maybe by December. I am starting to use my brain. Stop as retarded as that sounds it is actually quite interesting. I think that I can make my brain do the things I need it do such as focus. I have to be stripped of everything to understand things are serious. I work best under pressure. I don't fall apart. I'm not sitting here trying to lecture you, but I am trying to help you learn a little more about yourself through my recent discoveries. Back to my Yukon. I want it Black with tinted windows and big black rims and I want to install a system in it. Therefore that requires money, yuh that green paper that some people can toss around and others just can never have enough to get through the day or week or their life without it. So I figure this is where my great mind comes into play. I am not going to hand feed you shit you have to be just as creative as me to make it. I have ways of getting that legal money and ways of saving the money that I have. I am not begging people for shit. I'm going to use the brain that everyone says I have to make money. So once I start this ball rolling the money will roll in too. Thus forcing me to do better in school because they pay your dumb ass to go to college whether you know it or not. I should be a guidance counselor for the mis-guided like myself. In order to get somewhere you have to know where you want to be. Not just in your head but you have tell people so that you will have someone other than yourself to let down. Plan an event around you goal but keep it to yourself. Like with my car I am going to have a night out on the town. I realize it hurts me more to let someone down that I love than to let myself down. Once you get used to failure rejection is nothing. Write that down. If you never failed at anything than you are not perfect you just started at third base. I want to be somebody. O Somebody is going on my desk on the name plate. I know that, you know that, and everybody around me knows it. Don't worry my time is now!!!"

This is a warning if I have argued or fought with you in the past year all the topics will be a addressed. So if you think you are gonna be this journal and it's gonna be all friendly with flowers and roses then you might wanna listen to ya mama's muzik ain't nothing gonna be nice wriiten here. All of this ""friends"" from the past. You finna getcha issue.
1. R.I.P. Laurence Othello Williams Sr. 9/1/1961-6/21/2002 Gone but not forgotten you will forever live on through me I Love You Dad! Save me a seat, some wings, and a halo.
2. Why do people who don't talk to you in a year hit you to see if you breathing?
S. Taylor and D. Glover are exempt. Only exceptions. It's like people who you knew and was tight with for a minute you disappear and come back they be like wassup man you know you my dog. Save it homie. Now I see how people who go to jail feel. Nobody accepts your calls, they be busy instantly and they be like I'mma call you back. They never do. I guess I just feel like no matter what you should called or visited or emailed or something. But that's life you gonna be on top forever.
3. Watch the Dave Chappell Show cuz this journal is gonna be like that. Offensive.
4. If you hate your job eat it. You aren't the only person in the world who hates their job. Everybody hates their job some people are bold enough to go shoot the place up. Or do what I do eat a hole in the clock. I am supposed to be off at one hour. I take my time and work all the way through close to the next hour. Gangsta!
5. Customer who come to you when your lights are off talking about are you closed.

"event","decided to call Lowell Steve once a day until he called me back. Finally talked to him the other day.
I was like ""uhm.. what is going on in your head"" HAHA cause one day he ignores me, and the next is all up on my shit. I'm not down for games. So i told him straight forward. I DON'T WANT YOU.. i just want to know if we are friends and can chill or waht not.  Then he says.. if i hang out with you.. i just want to MAKE OUT WITH YOU!... but i'm the immature one?  Whatevs, it's OVER.

I just found my IROCK (a wicked old school i POD) it has 11 of my wicked old songs on them and listening to them is making me laugh... i'm going to breakfast with stephanie now... she is oproud of me for telling steve whats up. IF u guys wanna chill call my cell phone its always with me."

"event","Steve MacDonald is mean. He probably has taken the cake for hurting me like no other. I just wasted too much time with him and i don't know how else to feel but regret and anger. He will always make me angry. When i look back at my highschool i'll think of how fake it was, and how much i wasted my life being in love. i dont ever want to be hurt again. 
i'm not ok

Stephen from Lowell says i'm a good girl, and can do so much better than him anyway. I wish that was the case.


i'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me."

"event","So today, it's all pieced together. My life is kinda making more sense to me.


I'm just not over Steve, Over going away to school, and I feel as though i want to Move on in life.  I can't do that yet without getting over Steve. But i kinda don't want to.


You guys can look at me, and point fingers call me what you want. I think my acts are based on me solely feeling insecure without stephen. He was my security. and i took us for granted. Maybe he's what i need in my life.    But then again i'm always wrong.


Please don't judge me, i'm trying to grow up, and its the hardest thing i've tried so far. Let me make my own mistakes, whether i do them over and over again and don't learn for a while, or learn right away.   The last thing in the world i need right now is someone telling me i'm stupid, or saying ""WOW i can't believe Jess""... i'm normal. like everyone else. we all make mistakes.



""Look for MR. RIGHT NOW""



I saw meet the Fockers tonight :)"

I'm hurting.. there's no doubt about that. Everyday is a struggle to find happiness, cause as soon as i find some it's taken from me. 

Everything is just so confusing, and i need time to straighten everything out. I thought that i was going to be able to start my life over on a good track but in reality it's harder than it seems... So again..

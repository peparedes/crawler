I don't really dont have anything to say and I am having a hard time typing right now.  I was recently evicted from my apartment and I am extremely pissed off and I am sure to be for a while.  I have talked the situation to death and I have cried countless tears of anger and I can no longer ponder over the issue.  Because I am not in my right mind currently I am going to leave it at that and I will come back to this particular issue in the near future.  I want to take this time to clear my head and figure out what my next step is going to be..."

"event","I have tried logging into this account time and time again over the last year or two but I can never remember my password. And I CANNOT for the life of me remember what email address I set this up with.  It has been about 8 years since I started this journal and so much has changed some, thankfully, for the better.  I love reading through my old posts and thinking ""there is no way that I could have written"" that but alas I did.  Besides who else could Have done so.  But that is neither here nor there for the moment. Sitting here looking at my profile picture I am taken back to that place.  Not often but on occasion I wonder ""what happened to that well worn and all too comfortable hoodie"". That was taken in 2007 in the bathroom of the MCS building when I as attending Angelo State University, for the first time anyways.  I remember the day I bought it.  It was cold outside and I was perusing the ASU bookstore as I nonchalantly came across the ""winter section"" and I began to contemplate buying a sweatshirt or hoodie.  Since I was both cold and had come to the conclusion that it was necessary for me to own some ASU paraphernalia I then proceeded unhesitatingly to dish out the $40 dollars which was the sales price for said hoodie thus killing two bird with one stone.   Looking back at old photos brings back so many memories both good and bad but I will spare you the ruddy details for the time being .  I for some reason now realize how skinny I was.  I don't ever recall being that skinny but apparently I was.  Some days it bothers me more than others but most I just try not to care about it much at all.  But that doesn't always work.  I hate that it currently it seems that I am gaining weight at every turn. And that all my past efforts now lie on the floor fallen in vain due to what countless hours of ""working out"" and ""eating right"" and blah blah blah.  Between my knee and my back seriously though some thing has got to give. I currently weigh in at my heaviest but with high hopes and inspiring endeavors to only lose weight from here on out.  Ok Ok I get I will go to the doctor.  My back aches with every breath and my knee swells for what seems like no reason at all.  Over the counter medications no longer work and the pain only grows with each passing day.  My shoulders have become tense beyond the reach of any soothing relaxation or release and my head throbs from worry and stress with no relief in sight. I wake up most mornings to attend a job I've grown to hate and I am monotonously going through the motions of life. But as this post has already taken a morbid turn I am going to end it here as I journey down the path of the next chapter and say to be continues..."

It has been about 2 years and so much has happened in that amount of time.  So much has changed so drastically it's hard to believe the places I've been in, both mentally and physically, and the many people I have met and all the opportunities I explored or missed out on the chance to explore.  I don't have much to say at this time really I am just trying to get back into the habit of writing again.  I would like to start updating again on a regular basis.  This is my attempt at getting back into what I love and that's writing.  When I started this journal what was it now six or seven years ago I was hoping It would still be going strong today.  It is still going I can say that but as far as it going strong not so much.  Well that's about all I have to say at this time but i will be back soon with a true update of what is going on with my live."

"event","I just stopped by to see if anything new was going on.  I started to read all of my old posts and dI thought way that was a long time ago.  I haven't even logged on in over a year.  It's hard to believe that it was five years ago when I started this.  I have never been consistent with anything in my life including this.  I started this journal as somewhat of a test.  To see if i could keep it going and to keep track of my memories.  I did okay for the first year maybe two but eventually i died off.  I was reading some of my older post and I just thought way when did th at happen, i don't remember writing that.  I think it is awesome though how I can go back to certain times in my life and sort of relieve that moment.  I probably want start writing again, not on a regular basis anyways. But i will definitely keep updating from time to time just to see where it leads me and what memories I tend to want to keep a hold on. 


Here is a quick update on my life.  I don't remember what I have written about or not but here is a recap/update.

I went to ASU for a couple of semesters, bombed out.  Quit school got a job at sonic and moved into my own apartment.

Worked at sonic for about a yr then my sister moved in with me.  We got a two bedroom apartment all this time i'm still working at sonic then i get the idea to join the air force

Spend a couple of months preparing for basic then I quit my job at sonic took a month to adjust to the idea and headed out.

For the last eight months I have been through boot- camp, tech school and I am currently employed as a dental assistant at mcguire air force base in new jersey."

"event","Just stopping by for a minute to say... I joined the air force.  I'll be leaving for basic training January 6th.  I'm nervous, scared, anxious and whatever else you can think of.  It really hit me hard this past weekend.  I Went home for the home coming game and to see my family because I'm not sure when I'll be able to see them again.  Anyways I was at the game and it got me to thinking about my life and I realized I missed out on a lot during high school.  I saw some old ""Friends"" who three years ago I would never of had a conversation with now I'll probably never get that chance.  And I started thinking about everyone I'll be leaving behind i.e. my niece and my nephews.  I'll be gone for years at a time with writing as my only form of communications, and probably an occasional phone call. There are so many people that I'll probably forget about and who will inevitably forget about me.  But I am not hesitant to move on with my life just to forget about the past and embrace my new future. Or is it my destiny. Is this what I have been striving for since the beginning.  Only time will tell.  What lies before me only God knows.  Will this work out for the better.  I'll pray that it does.  I logged on today for the first time in months not expecting to have much to say but it turned out I had an entire blog to be written.  Even at this point I have so much more to say but I should be going.  I'd forgotten how relaxing and destressing this could be.  I totally plan on coming back for some more therapy soon."

Classes are moving along slow however, I do have a paper due on wednesday and I think my speech/powerpoint presentation is due on Thursday.  That means I have a lot of work to do in the next couple of days.  I have to think about what I am going to write about ,write it, and then type it.  Luckily for me this is just a rough draft so I can rewrite it and work a little more on it next week.  Then I have have to prepare a 7 minute presentation on playing the Marimba.  My hypothetical audience is a group of sixth graders coming into band.  I have to convince them that the Marimba is the right instrument for them to choose.  Anyways, I should be at work right now but I'm taking an extra long break because work sucks.  But that is all for now so Goodbye."

"event","I just got out of class and I'm feeling a little annoyed.  I had to write an essay about a life ""changing experience"" or something like like.  Something about an event that changed the way I think now or how I view life.  So being me I wrote and essay about how my ""friends"" changed me for the better, though I'm not sure it's true, but it was all I had to write about.  Then the professor feels that it was time for my essay to be read in class, it was real dumb.  I hated it for various reasons.  Mostly because I just think that all my essays are dumb and because it wasn't about what I wanted it to be about.  I didn't write what I really felt or what I really think.  I didn't write about what events with my friends influenced me or whatever.  It wasn't me what I wrote but I can't write about what really happened.  Though there are people saying they understand me more now, after reading my essay and stuff.  It is true to a certain extent but it isn't the whole story about exactly how my friends helped me.  Anyways what's done is done besides I have to rewrite it anyway so I'll be able to add stuff.  I think I might completely start over.  The same subject of course just from a different perspective so-to-speak.  That's the word how my perspective on life has changed."

I had to change my schedule so I could get back into AP english, noww I'm behind in all my classes.  I got my computer last week and this is my first official ""document"" to type.  The halftime show on friday was very bad.  The trombones came in early and no one was in time. It really sucks.  I don't see how some can write so much I already don't have anything to say.  So I'm gonna go and I'll update later."

"event","I had some stuff to say but I kinda forgot.  Oh we finally got music to the closer of the 2005 marching seson.  Good news the front line can actually play through the first two songs.  They don't actually sound all that good, but last year it took us the entire summer band to learn the first song.  Now it only takes a couple of hours.  My fingers are all swollen from playing with for mallets and I can't bend my pinkies.

Wednesday was Leighannes' birhtday so a acouple of people went to her house after band.  We played Texas Hold 'em, which I 've never played, and won two hands.  Becca B. gave her the Harry Potter came so after everybody left me sarah and tyler played.  I didn't score any points. Then over the weekend I had some relief from four mallet playing and my fingers almost healed, but then monday rolled around.

So yesterday I don't remember why but we were at the school then me and Sarah went over to leighannes.  Oh yeah the percussion at to play at some thing for the teachers.  It was real bad we were not in time at all.  Then of course after we played to teachers told us how awesome we were.  Anyways we played Quidditch or that Harry Potter game, however you spell it, and I won I cauth the snitch.  Then we went down to make lunch but the bread was molded, so on the way to buy bread we went to Taco Bell and got bean burritos.  After that we played some weird game called, oh hell I don't remember the name but anyway, you have to bulid settlements and stuff, I won that one to.  Sarah's mom had called and told us about a new Ice cream shop that was hiring from 3 to 5 so we headed over there to fill out applications.  Went back to her house and played Balderdash the n headed to band camp.

I heard some new music beacause I went to Sarahs house so she could change and I borrowed a shirt from her.  It had a band on it called the okay dont remember the name but their like an irish punk rock.  I think I heard them on the radio once pretty cool.

Oh man I almost forgot the most interesting news all summer.  My sister had her baby she named him something I don't know how to spell, but anyways he is a week and a day old today.  And I'm getting some more of my poems published if anyone should care."

"event","I,m trying to think if I have anything interesting to post. No.  I didn't think so, just thought I should.  No ACDEC practice for 3 weeks in a row, I don't know how I'll get anything done.  

OH Yeah, I went to this thing at FBC yesterday called underground church, I can't believe I forgot.  Anyways, we had to pretend that we were in a closed country where religion can't be practiced openly.  By the way Hutto came down to join us, so we were divided into groups two Hutto and two Taylor people, and we were each givin a card with a color from one of the five groups, I was blue by the way.

  So then they gave us a map of some places we had to go to to get another sticker and after we received the stickers we were to report to our safe house.  When we reach our location we had to find another believer, to do that we had to go up to a person and ask do you have any used newspapers for sell, and if they answered come and walk on the water we got a sticker.

  The safe house was some of the church members who volunteered to help out.

  The twist was there were secret police that we had to doge, cause if we got shot we were taken to prison.  So I'm in my group and our first location is the hospital.  So we are walking along and one of the Hutto girls says I want to see a police so we can run and then about a minute later we see some and they start to chase us, so we take off running and they chase us for like three blocks and the me and colin cut across the old middle school yard and the other Hutto girl gets shot.  And on top of that it rained most of the came then it gets all humid and stuff

 We continue on our journey and we decide to walk trough the park and we see these Hutto guys and that girl is like thats my sunday school teacher hes not a police but I was skeptical so we kept our distance.  Then they offer to help us like they know were to go so she gos over to them me and colin still keeping our distance and then she gets shot.

So now it is just us Taylor folk and we see another lady following another group, we never did figure out if she was a police.  After dodging police getting rained on and taking several short cuts we finally make it to the Hospital and just our luck the believer was a Hutto person and we wern't sure if we should ask her because we didn't want to look stupid but we did and she was and we got our sticker.  

We never made to our second location, which was a big gray spot somewhere near vance st, no idea where that was. so we had to walk all the way back to the church.  We made it as far as the track and then we get picked up by some guys from Hutto and they drive us back to the church.

We get inside the church and it is completely dark with the exception of a few candles.  So then we pray and sing some songs but we had to do it all in a whisper.

This may be a little long and confusing but I hope you get the gist of it."

"event","Okay I'm back again with absolutely nothing to say but I though I should follow up on my so called ""commitment"".  So I decided that I'm not going to England simply because I don't want to, I could probably afford if I wanted to but I'm just not going to try, isn't that a great attitude to have.  I remember when mrs. rowe first told us about going I was somewhat excited and I actually thought about going but now it's like England big deal.  I'm just at a point in my life where nothing excites or bores I'm not really content with anything I just don't care all that much anymore.  

We finally got our marching music and actually played instead of just warming up on Thursday.  Most of it wasn't that hard, the way chris explained it I was expecting something damn near impossible to play.  But everything worked out for the better.  The only part I'm worried about, and this is just the opener, is the 4 mallet playing.  We eliminated some by excluded a couple of cymbal crashes which I will miss dearly, but I shall be able to conquer as long as there is less 4 mallet playing, that I still can't do all that well.  So chris actually let us take home his mallets because this guy that he brought to listen to us told us to go home and practice and since we didn't buy mallets that we were supposed to last year we used his, and those mallets we are going to have to buy them this year.  That really sucks because I'm a senior and Im graduating early so I'll only use them for a short period.  Ooh maybe I can sell them to Mr. brown.  But anyway since we are now involved in the indoor marching show they would come in handy but since I wont be there they do me no good.  Like I'm actually gonna practice but I do need to improve my techniques.

ACDEC practice is going okay I guess, I'm not really sure about a lot of things this year.  Those thursday practices may very well do me some good since I don't really read when I should, which reminds me I still need to do my summer reading which is just reading so I wont have to write those stupid essays that I wasn't going to write anyways.  I'm actually liking ACDEC, more than I though I would it's not bad.  There is only a lot or reading if you try and do it all at once instead of managing your time by not trying to read it all in an hour just before practice like I did one morning.  There are some songs in the music that I like you know the ones I can understand and follow along with in the text.  There's this one song in English that I can't even follow.  I guess I'm going to be spending a lot of time with these people over the next 6 months or however long.  Bryce told me the other day he hopes I make the team instead of christina, I guess she wasn't a good team member.  I think I actually joined because it would help me with my whole commitment deal because if I want to make the team and if I do make the team I'll have to start pulling my own weight and become more responsible with my work.

Thats pretty much all I've been doing this summer, band and ACDEC.  And looking for a job.  Well technically I don't think you can call what I've been doing looking but at least I'm starting somewhere.  I have however applied to places before.  Okay I never actually applied but I did at the very least fill out the applications or thought about filling them out.  That's actually what I'm going to do this week: fill out my applications two or them to be exact one for HEB and one for the Newspaper place.  Where I really wanted to work or still do rather is Wal-Mart but I think I'll give up on that mostly because I don't want to spend more time filling out the application that you have to on the computer. I think I'll go now and since I made a long post I'll let this count as at least to so I can take some more time off."

Anyways the only reason I'm doing this is because I'm trying to change my attitude or whatever towards my activities or something, that might be confusing to you but I know what I'm trying to say,  anyways I have never actually become involved in something then stuck it out for the long run, except band but I even thought about quiting that, but now especially since I'm gonna be graduating soon and starting college I need to be more committed, even if it's something like livejournal, but hey you gotta start somewhere right.  I'm getting better though, through the course of the summer I find myself looking at colleges and planning for my future, like where I'm gonna live, finding a job, and trying to get a car.  Hopefully I'll be able to stay on this track, I haven't found myself straying to far away but that only means I'm that much closer to doing so.  Well thats really all I have to say I'm gonna get back on my college bound track."

"event","It has been a while but I am finally back, again.  So I think i decided that because I like to write and take pictures I'm going to major in journalism.  Now I just have to find a college.  Since I'll be graduating early I plan to do a lot of looking and on getting a job.  I was looking at NYU and some other schools of art in Massachusetts.  I find some are more expensive than I thought and some others are not, but hopefully I can go wherever I choose. 

Get this my neighbors, who lived across the street, move out to California and they are planning on buying me a computer for college.  They even offered to help pay for my tuition or something.  About that job thing I'm thinking I should work so I can at least save some money, I'm sure any amount would help.  And besides I need a car, I wonder how expensive housing is in Mass, I know it's pretty steep in New York but that's about all I know.

You know how people are always telling me I'm smart and all of this, yeah well that's not really doing me any good right now.  I mean why be smart if I'm not even going to apply it to my school work or anything for that matter.  Lately I have been slipping further and further away from the top ten percent.  I doubt I'll graduate there unless I really focus next semester and apply my so called genius.

The last two six weeks were real bad for me.  I almost failed English US History and Physics.  Not that they are hard but I just stopped turning in my work.  The tests were easy and all the daily work, it was the labs and the homework that really brought me down.  I passed and all but my GPA, I don't even want to talk about that.  But now since I have people offering to help me get to college I have some motivation to get my act together so I can finally get out of here."

I've written like a million poems I just haven't posted them is all.
I'm not sure you want to read them, I let some people from school read them i.e Sarah, Nikki, Bryce etc. and they all said it was scary so....

I haven't found out anything about the poetry contest but hopefully I'll know soon, I did however finish the profile for the poem that is getting published, maybe I'll post that too.

Cold
Surrounded by so much love

when did i loose myself

I admire you from afar

i think of you always 
though i try not to care

why i no longer have to hide
so many things i have to tell
why i haven't i cannot say
i can always write
but it isn't the same

Anyway I signed up for poetry memory, I did'nt last year cause I did'nt think i could do it.  I actually didn't do angy sleeping I was up all night laughing at stuff that happened the weekend before, beside that's when my headache was at it's worse.  I was actually to tired to sleep.   So i had to get up and be at the school by 4:00 AM, that's early.  At first I wasn't even going to go but I changed my mind at the last minute, and I thought I'm already up might as well go.  So after weeks of preperation and pain I got on a bus with the german club and we headed for houston.  I had signed up for other events so I dind't get in line thinking I wouldn't have enough time.  Man was I right because people like Amy eneded up waiting for 2 hours.  When I finally got in line there was still a lot of people but I only waited about 45 minutes.  Then at the awards assembly my headache came back and I was so nervous but I ended up winning 4th and so on February 26 I'm headed out to UT to compete at state compotition. Yay!"

Okay so first we went to chicken express nobody ate expect for sarah, i don't eat and jill is poor but I don't what Camerons deal was, then we went to Andrew Tovars house and sarah learned how to play some song on the drums but before that we had to co by Camerons house to pickk up some stuff. We stayed there for like 45 minutes becaue jill had to be home by 11:30 and we were going to go to the middle school at 10: but didn't leave until about 10:30. So we went out to the school to take pictures of ""Ghosts"" in was funny because every body except for me was scared jill and sarah were holding onto cameron we he was the scaredest one there. So they all swore that they saw weird things in the picture but I didn't see jack. So then we went back to Sarahs house and looked at all the pictures we took and said what everything looked like, then Jill had to go home but she didn't want to be alone so she went on and we came later. It was funny because after she left sarah started talking about how tired she was then she said that she was going to take a ""power nap"" whatever, she said it is a five minute nap thats suppose to wake you up yeah anyways so she took her nap and then we headed out to jills. And just like on wednesday after Church sarah couldn't find her house and then she passed it she was like thats it then she was like no its not and she speed by it that was funny. So then we went and looked at the pictures on her computer so we could see them better. Then we all started cracking up at some cabbage patch dolls that she had, it's funny because sarah was looking at this one doll and she said she always thought it was funny to wonder what if it was a boy it was hillarious you had to be there. Then we where siiting there while jill was typing on im and then sarah was like mmm sasauge, then everybody was all hungry and stuuf except for me of course, so we went in the kitchen and thay ate cookies, so then Cameron starts telling us about this story that his dad told him about ""Mary Worth"" if you go in the bathroom and say her name 3 times you'll see yourself in the mirror, and his dad said it actually worked. So then sarah was trying to say something about it and said butterworth instead and so we all cracked up at that for like an hour and then sarah just had to suggest that we try it jill of course didn't want to , but then all 4 of us went into the bathroom and it din't work so we suggested just one person but of course they were all scared to do it by theirself so jill and sarah did it and they swear it worked, while they were comung out me and cameron snuck around and scared jill and sarah who was still in the bathroom said ""at least it wasn't me and she didn't even know what happend she just heard jill scream and then we laughed at that for like another hour. Then we went to the livingroom and sterted telling stories that were so hillarious but now I don't have the time to tell them but I will later, so we were in there cracking up and it was like 1:30 and sarah was supposed to be home at one so she ended up getting grounded. There's a lot more to this story I'll be back tommorow to finish it.

Yeah, Anyways, I love doing all the school activities, Green Santa etc... I love to wrap presents and to make people happy, thats probably THE coolest thing anyone can do. It's fun to but presents for little kids whos parents cant afford to, I love kids, especially my niece, she'll be two in April, they are just so fun to play with. I love playing with her and she laughs at everything, kinda like me, and she is always running around its like she never gets tired, but I could play with her all day. I remember when my sister had move to San Angelo, and I missed her like crazy, but now she lives in Roundrock or something like that and I see her all the time.

I had thought for a while that I would be a pediatrician, but the whole concept of being around sick kids is overwhelming. And it would suck to now that one of them is dying and there is nothing I could do able it. Now I am leaning toward business,I think.

It started at the game, or on the way to the game rather, Because of some things that I was upset about I cried the whole way to the game. I was hoping by the time we got to the game I would be all cried out but I wasn't. When we got to the football stadium I didn't get off the bus so I had all these parents sitting on the bus with me, eventually I had to get out so they could move, but I stayed on for a while still crying with people worried about me. I actually made my friend Jaboa cry I felt really bad about that. It was weird because I had all of these parents asking me questions because they were trying to make me feel better, they asked stuff like is every thing okay at home, am I worried about my grades, and if I was sick etc. And the truth is I just wanted to be left alone, They were asking me if I wanted to go home in a way I Did but being the last game I wanted to stay and see things and stuff. The truth is I justed wanted to be left alone because I didn't want to talk about it. I felt really bad because they were paying all of this attention to me and I justed wanted to be left alone, They offered so many times to take me home, the truth is if I were to go home my mom would want to know why I didn't want to have to explain to her that I was crying but mostly I didn't want to have to explain why I was crying in part I Didn't even know why I was crying and it's not like I actually tell my mom stuff. They were asking me if there was anybody I wanted to talk to , and you know I told them that I wanted to talk to Sarah K. because in the last couple of months I have become really close to her and there really is nobody else that I talk to. So she came she made me feel better though I didn't talk to her because if I did I would just cry even more so she told me I could write it to her in a letter, I've written her a few letters in the past and they have always helped.( I wrote her a poem saturday night because I was still feeling lousy and there was a lot of stuff I wanted to get out so I went home and I wrote what was in my heart.)The thing about it is I really hate to cry and either way if I try to hold it in or after I always end up with a really big headache, that sucks. After Sarah talked to me I went over with the rest of the section and it didn't make me feel any better because Joboa was still crying and also kim and Erica were crying, so we were all just crying together. After awhile it did eventually get better not a lot but some. I went and talked to Nikki and Sarah and we did fun stuff, then at the end of the game is were all the fun came. There was a lot of hugging and taking of pictures going on. I took pictures with Nikki, Sarah, Alec, Cara, Cameron, and Jennifer, and we all hugged each other like ten time. So I guess come the end of the night things were going okay for me. There is still some stuff going on with me but you know.
Peace!"

"event","Lately I have not been motivated to do anything. I never do my homework anymore, usually I would just wait to the last minute to do stuff but now i just haven't been doing it at all, I try to keep up with my Hisstory homework because Mr q actually counts off if you thurn things in late 20 points to be excat thats a lot. In my other classes I turn in things like to weeks late luck for me they don't count off for late papers. Thats probabl not a good happen to get into, specially since I'm so close to graduated, well there is so much more I have to write about but right now I just dont have the time so God bless, and I'll be back soon"

"event","So I took the PSAT last saturday, so I wasn't able to go to UpwardBound. I thougth that the test was pretty easy. I answered almost all of the questions, except for a few on the verbal section. The math was easy which brings me to my next point. That sat at UB they took the ninth grade TAKS assessment and out of about 50 students, fresh-senior, only 13 people made 50% or higher, Which means we either have some really stupid people or they just didn't take it seriously. I had to take it this sat, and it was the easiest test I ever taken. The week before that we took and english assessment and I got my results on sat, I have an 11.1 reading level and a 12.2 instructional reading level, Still not to sure what that means but I'm guessing that's good since i'm in the eleventh grade. Let's see what else happened, Oh we lost another football game thats like 5 in row, and we got a lecture to day from Mr. Brown, the band director about how bad our behavior was at the game, and of course he talked the whole period like he usually does. He talked about how people need to resolve their problems within the sections and with other sections. There seems to be this thing going on where nobody likes each other. Thats kinda like this whole thing with the band and the percussion battery/pit, the band seems to have a problem with us, its like were not even part of the band. Like they want to alienate us from everyone, it's different when they say something about the brass or the woodwinds they are still part of the band but when they say percussion or pit it's like we are our own organization or something. I don't know it's just weird. Well I gotta go do my homework.Peace!"

"event","Let's see what is going on in my life. Nothing. Absolutely nothing at all. Nothing interesting or weird or anything for that matter ever happens to me. Did't have any fun this weekend much like all my other weekends. I just sit at home and watch tv when I should be doing my home work. Which reminds me I have a DBQ do on thursday. Stupid DBQ. Anyways hopeful my life will become a little more interesting in the near future. I so suck at spelling. Yeah i know that was just a random though that popped into my mind. I do that a lot, you now I'm supposed to be writing or talkking about one thing and my mind just seems to wander to other thoughts. Maybe that's why I suck at writing esssay, I can never stay stay on topic. I should probably work on that. Well, what else is going on. Oh yeah I took the PSAT on Saturday, it seemed easy enough ecxept for a coulpe of the analogies. I really hate those things I never know what any of those stupid words mean I'm just bad at english a together . The only thing I like about English is the Teacher and Writing. I suck at spelling as I randomly mentioned earlier I guess and vocabulary is not my strong suit either, Did i mention I suck at english. Well I gotta go do homework. SERIOUSLY."

"event","So yesterday was UIL for the band. It was a bad day for me, because we got a 2 straight across the board (I think those judges were stupid). But I guess it was a good day because the Frontline all felt like we did a good job, which we did, but you know what are you gonna do. Everyone went out there and did their best I guess thats all that matters. Even Nikki (who is always yelling at us because we are usually not in time with the band though I think most of the time its the other way around) said we played good, and for those of you who heard us play on Friday which was our best performance we played that much better at contest. The band is never in time I mean half the band doesn't even watch the drum major. Though I will admitt that never use to watch the drum major. Mostly it was because I never played, seeing as how I never went to summer band I was a little behind, but most of my music I actually knew and ever ince un a while I would play. My freshman and Sophomore years I was always uptigh about marching because the judges walk around on the feild and I just knew one of them would come close to me and realize I wasn't playing the whole time, but lucky me none of the judges ever came close to me. And unlike some people(lawrence who never even lets his horn touch his face) who makes it all obvious that they're not playing I always made an effort to creat the allusion of playing even though I think you can tell whenever someones not playing. Well anyways I gotta go do my homework which I am making an effort of doing now."

"event","I was just reading through a friends journal to find out what i had missed in her life over the last few months and she reminded me of something. I'm going to be going to college in a while and I think I should save some money. I also planning on applying for a scholarship or grant, but I'm thinking I'll probably need a car and I should probably get my license too. I don't really have time for a job right now but in about a month or so after things settle down I plan to get one. Well I have a lot of homework to do which I haven't been doing lately but I'm hoping to get my grades up this six weeks. Oh that reminds me I picked up my class rank last week or something. I ranked number 29 not quit in the top 10% but pretty close. That's why I have to do my homework so when I get my rank next semester I will be in the top 10%."

"event","So the other day I mentioned how I hated life but a friend helped me through that by explaining that i don't Hate life im just not content with what is going on now. I was thinking the other day how life can be a wonderful thing and at times not so wonderful. I guess it's not the fact that i don't like my life but sometimes i just don't see the point in living. Like i wonder why are we here. Sometimes i just don't understand what the point of living is. I mean you're born you live and then you die. Then I think about the bible how God creates the universe then how he created man in his own image. Then that gets me thinking is there a reason that God put us here. Are we here to serve a soul purpose in live. Is there a destiny that each and everyone of us is here to reach. And if you ever do find your purpose in live how will you now when it has happened. Does everything happen for a reason. If so how will we ever know. There are sp many questions i have and there are so little answers out there for me to find. Am I here to fulfill a destiny. Will i ever reach that destiny. I just wish i could find the answer to all of my questions. Though most of the time i don't see the point in just being i try to find what my purpose in live is nd with the help of my friends i can definitely say i no longer hate life."

"event","I really hate my life, it sucks. I hate everything about it except fo my friends. My friends are the only thing that doesn't make my life suck. Sometimes I just hate being here so much I wish that I wasn't in this world. Sometimes I like to wonder what it would be like to be somewhere else. I really love my friends and they make things better for me but I just like to be left alone. It is so much easy to hate life when I am by myself. I mean it's cool to be around people you love and all that but I just want to be by myself. When I'm by myself I like to think about all sorts of things. I like to go for walks and listen to the wind and watch the stars. It is so cool to watch the stars. But sometimes when I am alone I miss my friends. There are so many things things that I want to tell people about stuff but the words just wont come out. When I have something to say I just write it down so I wont have to talk to anyone. There are so many things that I want my friends to know about me but I just don't feel comfortable talking to them. Well you get the point I ate life I hate being here, but I like being alone."

"event","I was born while Ronald Reagan was in office. Luckily, I was too young to know really what that meant at the time. My earliest memories are years later when Bush the First was running his course. I&nbsp;can remember dressing in my camouflage (tank top, shorts and canteen!) waving a mini American flag in front of the television while I watched <strike>Operation:&nbsp;Enduring Freedom</strike> soldiers from the Persian Gulf War come home. Mind you, in kindergarten I also was the <em>only</em> student in my class to make a donkey instead of an elephant, so it's pretty clear I had no idea what anything meant (and, if I'm being honest, I&nbsp;kept cutting off the trunk of the elephant and I'm pretty sure that my donkey ended up with three legs... did I&nbsp;mention they thought I had &quot;issues&quot; and I&nbsp;had to take assessment classes?) . <br /><p>I came of age with a president who was impeached for getting a blow job. Need I say more? No matter the good that Clinton did, he will always be remembered for the cigar and suit stain. Plus, he is responsible for DOMA and Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Thanks, A-hole.</p>And THEN, <em>then </em>I have had to endure two terms with arguably the worst president to have ever taken office.  32% of my life has been lived in George Bush's America. A really important and imperative 32%. I have lived in the most affluent country and also in a country facing a recession. The world has looked at us with admiration, indifference and rage (but at least 32% of the time it was rage...). I am only 25. Sheesh.<br /><br />Finally, not only the United States but <strong>INDIANA</strong> has spoken up and demanded change. I am thankful, and I am hopeful.<br /><br />I have this weird <em>feeling</em>... where I&nbsp;<em>don't hate </em>where I live... and I <em>like</em> the President... and I think <em>good things</em> are going to happen... and I don't think America(ns) totally suck... what's that called?<br /><br />Ah. Pride. That's what it is. What a strange, strange feeling.<br /><br />"

"event","L and I were driving to meet with my sister and nephew for dinner. There is countless construction going on on E. Washington Street, and on Post Road. Everyone is aware, everything is clearly marked. We're waiting in a long line for the light to change in order to be able to get over in the left turn lane. The line is long because the right side of the street is closed off, forcing people to merge left. Everyone knows this; there are countless signs, plus the construction has been happening for quite some time. <br /><br />Still, there are <em>those</em> people. <em>Those</em> people that are too <strong>fucking</strong> precious for this world, too <strong>fucking</strong> important to wait in a line with all us common folk, those who zip up the right lane and cut off a line of people. I cannot stand <em>those</em> people. I cannot STAND&nbsp;it. We were at the point where the roads merged, and sure enough, one of <em>them</em> zipped up the line and started to just mosey on over right next to us. Our window was down, their window was down. I was not driving, but I slammed on the horn and screamed something that was incoherent even to me. <strong>THIS MOTHERFUCKER HAS THE FUCKING AUDACITY TO PULL NEXT TO US AND SAY, &quot;NO, YOU BACK UP BITCH.&quot;&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />L starts to yell that you can't just cut in front of everyone, but he drives ahead in the lane next to us. He's in a lane that goes forward, and we're waiting to turn. <br /><br />And then.<br /><br />HE WAITS FOR THE ARROW AND CUTS IN FRONT OF US.<br /><br />I have never, ever wanted something bad to happen to someone as much as I wanted it to happen to him right then. <strong>PIECE OF SHIT.</strong><br /><br />And I can't stop playing the scenario over in my head; what I&nbsp;should have done differently, how I should have reacted or what I could have said.&nbsp;<br /><br />Really, though, what a complete and total piece of shit. PIECE OF SHIT. <br /><br />One thing has changed about me or in me, and it is clearer to me than ever before:&nbsp;I&nbsp;am not afraid anymore. If this huge man wants to kick the shit out of a pimply little guy, then I invite him to do so. Because I will press charges, I will sue and he will lose. I can take a punch for the satisfaction of knowing that I hit you in the gut financially. I will not be intimidated by a bunch of fucking mafia-wanna-bes with their big gold chains and their stupid sunglasses at night. You are no mafia; you are powerless and pathetic and that makes you angry. Go vote instead of being a stupid prick. <br /><br />But I suck a little bit, too. <br /><br />In retrospect, I should not have laid on the horn. <br />I should not have yelled. <br />I should not have met his inconsiderate action with one of my own. <br />I should not have wanted bad things to happen to him (and his family, his house, his lawn, his pets etc. etc. etc)...<br /><br />I should have shown compassion. I should have shown patience. <br /><br />But I sure as shit should not have let him cut in. I'm not wrong about that one. At all. <br /><br />I need to not excuse my philosophy of kindness, peace, love and compassion because it takes more effort in my current situation. I&nbsp;know I need to be better than that, but sometimes this whole &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; business has you spinning in circles and you either&nbsp; pop off or throw up.<br /><br />The other thing we need to work on is to not have L yell at big, scary men;&nbsp; I'm the one that will get the crap beat out of me. We already had a talk... but if I'm going to get killed, I'd rather it be because of something I did. <br /><br />I have to believe that this particular incident is indicative of who this person is, at least a little bit. Everyone makes mistakes while driving, everyone does stupid and annoying things. This man, however, not only knew that what he was doing was rude, he proceeded to yell and threaten us for calling him out on it and then proceeded to take some sort of revenge because of it. I&nbsp;may have failed this test, but this fuck flunked the class. <br /><br />I know it's stupid and weird to document this in a blog, but I have to put it out there because it just keeps replaying in my head so I keep feeling the anger and anxiety from it. I&nbsp;don't want to feel it anymore. So, this is me putting all this negative energy I'm harboring (and wasting) out into cyberspace where it can't really hurt anyone. (I'm sweating as I write this because it made me mad all over again). <br /><br />...I have a peace sign on my car. I&nbsp;can only imagine what the people behind me were thinking<em>.</em><br /><br /><br />"

"event","L and I&nbsp;watched a documentary tonight called <a href=""http://&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/ajBR0dq0XXk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/ajBR0dq0XXk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;""><em>For The Bible Tells Me So</em></a>. Basically, the filmmakers interviewed parents with LGBT kids, both young and grown, and also interviewed different theologians, pastors, ministers etc. regarding how the Bible is interpreted in regards to homosexuality. <br /><br />This topic will always be one that hits a chord with me, and for many reasons. My religious history is, uh, sordid to say the least. My mother was raised baptist, my father was catholic. We were not raised in a &quot;christian&quot; household by any standard. We did go to a Wednesday youth group, but all I really remember from that was that we were supposed to memorize verses and we got pins and patches for doing it. More than anything, I remember feeling terrified and never knowing why. I thought that if I was bad in church that I would go straight to hell. (Maybe we never got past the vengeful God of the old testament...) As adults, my siblings and I have faiths that are as different as we all are. We have all found a way to make our beliefs work in a way that not only tolerates the rampant amount of queer/homosexual issues in our family, but that really embrace and allow for them. <br /><br />My mother, though, is another story.<br /><br /><p>I don't want to come off here as harsh. This is the woman who bore me from her womb, who worked nights on her feet in a hospital so she could sleep during the day and be home with us. She once took back new outfits she had bought (and she never, ever spent money on herself for anything) because I needed glasses. She began a family with my dad when she was nineteen, and I&nbsp;know that both of them did the best they could with us for being so young and inexperienced. And they did love us, which is so much more than I can say for a lot of the nineteen-year-old parents that I have encountered. I see obligation there, but not love. <br /><br />All that being said, my mother and I have a very surface level &quot;relationship.&quot; Being the last child, and also being the only child to be in the house when the divorce was happening, I&nbsp;saw a different side of my mom. I&nbsp;was there <em>before</em> she found religion to be the answer to her questions. I was there when she would sleep for twenty hours a day on the couch in the living room. She went so far as to shut off the heat to her old bedroom, and I don't think she ever went there again. I slept on the floor of her old bedroom on the part of the carpet that looked new instead of worn from where their bed had sat for so many years. During this period of my mother, I don't know that I stepped up the way I should have. I don't know what I could have done at 17 that would have made anything better. I tried to understand, I tried to sympathize, but I was a self-involved teenager with the most angst this side of the Mississip'. <br /><br />I knew it would be a pointless endeavor to &quot;come out&quot; to her and to think there would be any amount of acceptance with it. I knew better, but part of me dared to hope. I thought that she might be able to look past what had happened with her husband and attempt to understand. Instead, as I really expected, I got the whole <em>hate the sin, love the sinner</em> talk. Really, I'd rather you say you just hate me. Because that's what you're truly saying anyway if you hate something that is so important and intrinsic to who I am. I remember the day I told her that I thought our relationship had changed, and that I didn't think she liked me anymore. I cried, which is not something I often did in front of her. She didn't cry. She calmly stated that she can only understand the Bible the way it is &quot;revealed&quot; to her. It was her Truth. <br /><br />I say I don't care, and I think I've said it so much it's true now. But I am not too proud to say that I miss my mother. I miss her. I&nbsp;miss who she was before Jesus came into the picture. Sometimes I want nothing more in this world than to be able to crawl onto her lap and lay my head on her chest and breathe in her perfume while she rocks me in her chair. I want to sit on the hang-glider with her and sing <em>I Went to the Animal Fair</em>. I want it to be 7:52 in the morning so she can be reading <em>Little House on the Prairie</em> books to me before the bus comes at 8:05. I&nbsp;want that complete and total acceptance, and the assurance that comes with it that not only are you loved, but you are enjoyed.<br /><br />But that will not happen again with my mother. I've broken her heart too many times in making the decision to be true to who I think I am. I will not apologize for that decision because I know it is the only decision I could have made/continue to make. I&nbsp;know, too, that there is a sadness that goes through me, in places I don't even know exist, because of it. <br /><br />I'm going full circle with this, I promise. If I'm going to talk about religion, I'm going to talk about it theologically because faith-based religion isn't enough for me. I do not believe in absolutes, and consequently I do not believe in absolute truth with a capital T. I do not believe there is one path to salvation, or that one must walk a path to get there. I do not believe that a soul is something given, rather I think it is earned. I cannot tell you if there is a god, if some guy walked the earth 2000 years ago with radical, crazy ideas. What I can tell you is that I believe in love, kindness and possibility. If this makes me an agnostic, I suppose that's what I am. I'm not sure what label fits me...<br /><br />I do know, however, that unconditional love is just that, and if any religion, no matter what it is, causes a parent's love to become conditional...<br /><br />it's heresy.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><br />"

"event","I'm not sure where I'm going with this livejournal post, so if you're not in the mood for scattered thoughts that may or may not have to do with anything of substance, feel free to skip on over. There's been a lot going on lately, both in the world and in my little life. I've been thinking...

I think:

I think that Palin should only inspire women to stay in the kitchen. It makes me sad to think that people (women especially) think that one can just substitute any vagina for another vagina and expect the same outcome. It reminds me of Ellen Degeneres' stand-up where she's going on and on about a grocery store situation where they run out of cheese.&nbsp; So the fictional manager approaches her and tries to substitute cottage cheese for sharp cheddar cheese that she's attempting to buy. She says that you can't just substitute something because it has the same name. It would be like if she went into a musical instrument store and asked for a trumpet and they tired to substitute it with a shoehorn. GET THE POINT?&nbsp;I had never heard of her until now, and I frankly don't give a damn. Since there was not a chance in hell I was going to vote Republican, I don't care who skeletor has as his running mate. I&nbsp;do hate, however, that the Republicans can claim diversity on this one. I call foul, and I pray it's a move that backfires on them since they are doing it for all the wrong reasons. Palin is NO Hillary (whether that's a good or bad thing) just because she has a vagina. 

I think that I am very proud of my girlfriend for her academic accomplishments. She works part-time at a job that is very emotionally draining, too, and I think she's fantastic at it. I admire her very much.

I think that I'm overall disappointed with Obama as a candidate. I applaud him for what he says he represents, but I hope he's not just pandering. I want change and to believe in hope, but I have tried to sustain myself on idealism before. You're left pretty hungry if that's all you've got. Not to mention the empty calories... 

I think that for some reason it's been really difficult being trans lately. I'm pretty sure that a waitress at our favorite diner referred to us as &quot;girls&quot; the other day. I had a period a week ago after bleeding all over the place from my injection. I came out in a situation I thought would be safe, but felt very judged afterward. I don't know. I think I'm letting people tell me their issues with me again, and I had told myself I wasn't going to do that anymore. It amazes me how audacious people can be. I know that I open myself up to it by objectifying myself as &quot;this type of person,&quot;&nbsp;but I didn't know that meant that the welcome mat goes out for them to walk-in and tell me what I should and should not be doing. I had someone imply that I was not &quot;proud&quot; to be who I am because I'm not 100% out and loud about it. Gee, thanks for judging the shit out of me without any prior knowledge of who I&nbsp;am or what I think. I am not stealth. Everyone wears different masks in different social situations; this is the same type of thing. Not to compare transgenderism to fetishism, but people who are in to BDSM don't always break it out during corporate meetings.

&quot;Jim, did you get the Smith file?&quot;
&quot;It isn't done yet, Bob. I deserve a spanking.&quot;

It's a stretch, I know, but it isn't like anyone has swaggered up to me and said, &quot;Hi, I'm Tom and I have a penis.&quot; No one at work has asked me, and if they did, I would be honest. 

I also think that one of the WORST things you can say to a trans person is, &quot;I would have known right away.&quot; No, you probably wouldn't have. The only people that get to say that are people that were told prior to actually meeting you. Of course they're going to say that; no one wants to feel stupid. But don't say it. People like that are the reason trans individuals try to overcompensate with their gender presentation. They are the reason I don't like 90% of the trans guys I meet, and why those trans guys act like hypermasculine jerks. Guess what?&nbsp;I am proud that I have not changed my personality in order to &quot;pass&quot;&nbsp;better. Don't make me regret that decision or question myself. A-hole. 

I think I like the soapbox.

I think that America's Next Top Model is not a good forum for transgender politics and I hate HATE Tyra Banks.

I think my new job is going to be frustrating, but that I&nbsp;might actually like it once I figure out what it is that I do. Plus, I get my own business card. How adult.

I think that it's 1 AM and I should probably try to sleep."

"event","I faxed the letter from my therapist to Dr. Brownstein's office yesterday from work. I've also E-mailed the patient history form back, along with a picture of my ta-tas. All I'm waiting on now is to make the phone call to set the appointment. The goal is to do it during L's winter break. I don't want to be gone for Xmas, though, so I'm trying to tap dance around that. <br /><br />I had a mild freak out after the breast picture was taken. It's not so often that I look at my body, and definitely not often that I see naked pictures of myself (read: NEVER). Since Philadelphia/college/even high school, I've gained ten pounds. Part of this is because of the hormones, the body growth etc, and part of this is because I'm a lazy bastard who doesn't eat right (read: American). After seeing the picture, I flipped my shit. I'm worried about how the other parts of my body with work with this subtraction I'm about to make. Mainly, I'm worried that I will be bottle-shaped. So, I've decided that I want to join a gym and to start lifting again. I also want to do cardiovascular work and build my stamina (read: winded during, uh, physical activity). <br /><br />I was reminded after this little freak out not to get so wrapped up in surgery. There is not a place in my mind that thinks that this is magical fix all, or that all my problems have stemmed from this. There isn't really a part of me that is resentful that this is part of my journey, a pit stop on my path that surely extends past the horizon. On the good days, I remember I'm blessed with this body, not cursed. I am blessed with this perspective that comes with a lot of responsibility and accountability whether you want it to or not. Although, physically, my body and I disagree, I do not hate it the way a person hates their fat thighs, big nose, etc. I do not <i>hate</i> it at all. <br /><br />Instead, what I really hate are the confines of this gender thing, dictating and demanding something from each of us that, no matter how hard we try, we will fail at one way or another. And in that failure will be ridicule and scorn that will make each of us a little more rigid and defined by standards we did not set. I hate that whether or not I have hormones or surgeries or I don't, I am ruled by these expectations that I did not create for myself. We all are. And I will forever be left wondering, ""What if I wasn't made to <i>feel</i> inadequate? Would these extreme measures need to be taken?""<br /><br />I am not questioning my decision or my convictions; I am questioning the possibility of fluidity with these rubber stamp labels given to each of us out of the womb. <b>If</b> there were to be true fluidity with gender and gender expression, would more people choose not to have surgery or HRT? Would I be one of them if this were true? And these questions are rather pointless at this point in time, because gender roles and rules are very, very real. I am not saying they are right, but no matter who you are, you are ruled by them. If you think I am mistaken, that you are an evolved being that doesn't see gender or does not conform to the gender expectations set before you, you should probably open your eyes and think either about the last time that you broke a gender expectation, or the last time you were criticized when you did. I think that people who say that they are colorblind and that they only see ""human"" are full of shit, and I think people who think they are beyond gender are full of shit, too. You cannot say you don't see difference and simultaneously benefit from your status within that system. That is offensive and wrong. Conversely, it sucks to be discriminated against and think it's solely because you need to work harder and that it has absolutely nothing to do with your race, gender, sexual orientation/preference, age and on and on and on. It does. Denial ain't just a river.<br /><br />They're institutions, people. They exist. They influence. They rule. They change. They mirror. They define. <br /><br />It's an enigma. A conundrum. A quagmire. I don't think I'm breaking any mold or paving any pathway to a new and better gender system. Maybe I've sold out, but I'm just trying to survive here. At the end of the day, when all is said and done, no matter how hard I try... I'm still human. <br /><br />And for all that radical talk..."

"event","Once upon a time, long before the ambiguity and constant questioning that came with college, I was very self-assured. In fact, I romanticize the person I ""used to be"" so much that you'd think that I was my own hero. I try to remember, though, that when I was 17, I was allowed the privilege of being 17; consequences didn't always meet up with my actions. 

Fucking invincible. 

Alongside being completely messed up, I was downright adamant about my convictions. I lived a life of black and white that now I criticize. It wasn't so much an ideology of ""you're either for us or against us, "" but more of an ""I dare you to challenge me"" philosophy. I guess at that age (and the fact that it was the Columbine era) it's either not worth the time and energy to argue, or people will just let you think what you want, assuming that one day you'll ""come to your senses."" 

I also didn't have to worry about being arrested. Okay, let me explain that. Of course I had to worry about being arrested, but I didn't have to worry about which cell block I'd be put in to. I'm sure back then I would have fetched at least two cartons of smokes for my dyke ass in the prison market. Now, though, I'm a little bit terrified. I'm either a traitor or a faggot. No, thank you.

Here's why I bring this up. We went to Target today and we happened to park next to a rundown green van. I'm not hating on the fact that it was rundown (yet), but as we passed it walking into the store, I noticed a bumper sticker that said, ""This is AMERICA. We speak ENGLISH. Learn it or leave it.""

Does anyone else hear Toby Keith?

I digress. We were outraged. We were righteously indignant. We kept right on walking into the store. But I did keep thinking about it. I thought about all the things I used to do, how I would have reacted to such a situation ""back in the day."" I also thought about the irony... writing a bump sticker criticizing people who cannot speak English when people who can not speak English probably can't read the bumper sticker to know that they're being scorned. And the bigger irony that it would be if it were printed in Spanish (or Italian, Greek or Canadian). 

The van was still parked next to us when we arrived back at our car. Something snapped back over in my brain, and I decided to honor my 17 year old self. No, I didn't vandalize (although, a certain SOMEONE I was with did SPIT on the van...). I very lovingly left a note underneath the windshield wiper. Here is what is said:

""In America, we drive nice cars. Please drive one or get out, you ignorant redneck.""

It was not penned with the most wit, but it was the best I could do in the precious time between leaving it and leaving the parking lot without being caught. They also had bumper stickers about being a motorcycle biker, and I think we all know that I often cannot physically defend what I emotionally/mentally do. 

Because it looks lame for me to brag about leaving a note on someone's car, I wanted to post a list of things that I've done in the past as someone not as... refined... as I am today. *BURP*

1. I once wrote back to the Ms. America Pageant who had sent me an entry, disqualifying myself forever based on the fact that I never intended on being the type of person they wanted to adorn their crown. Surprisingly, I never heard back. 

2. I participated in the spray painting of&nbsp; pro-choice messages on two anti-choice billboards in the city where I went to college. 

3. I offered a policeman condoms when we were escorted back to the ""Free Speech Zone"" when Bush came to the South Bend Airport to deliver a speech in support of Count Chocula. Er, I mean, Chris Chicola. (Bush was disappointed when he arrived, too). 

4. I participated in a ""Pro-War Rally"" in efforts to raise money to send to Prez Bush when the Iraqi: Pretend We're Occupying for Freedom began. I think we raised about $3.47. That left about $5,000,000,997 to go! We almost had it...

5. I wore a shirt that said, ""Sign My Petition"" with an arrow pointing down when a girl in one of my classes attempted to get United Sexualities kicked out of the campus chapel where we held on our meetings. I had to give a presentation for that class, and I stared at her the entire time I was giving it while wearing that shirt. I also offered to help her make her petition grammatically correct. She declined my help.

6. I read a poem at a drag show in front of my fathers, teachers and the President of the college that said ""fuck"" a lot. I received a standing ovation.

7. Someone threw water balloons at a group of us when we were walking into the dorms. We all went up to the floor and got int he face of the person who did it who looked absolutely terrified and apologized repeatedly and swore it wasn't personal. I declined his apology.

8. I put rainbow stickers on a car that had bumper stickers that were CLEARLY not in favor of the gays.

9. In my first presentation in my college career, I managed to use the word ""cunt."" 

10. In high school, I wrote an article criticizing the Dean of Students regarding a comment he made about same-sex couples. It was published. A statement of apology was issued. 

I do not think these things changed the world, but I wonder if I have the chutzpah to do any of them again. I'm not so much into vandalism anymore, nor do I think talking back to a cop will get me anywhere. But damn, did I have fun. And damn if I didn't think I could get away with ANYTHING. Sometimes I miss the days of not bothering to weigh in with, ""Well, I could see it that way."" 

Fucking invincible, right?"

Why don't we get you a neat, new outfit for your first day? There are a few cute shirts that are already matched up with skirts you could wear! How about that?<br /><br />Me: <b>I DON'T WANT TO WEAR A SKIRT.</b> I want pants like M.C. Hammer. <br /><br />Mom: No, you need to look nice. Here, look at these. There's a red one with two bears shearing an ice cream soda, or a blue one of a bear cheerleader. Which one do you like best? I think the red one is nice...<br /><br />Me: I guess I'll take the blue.<br /><br />Mom: Why do you want the blue one? <br /><br />Me: Because, blue is for boys. I'm a boy, so I can wear blue.<br /><br />Mom: (<i>Sighs and rolls eyes, immediately looking exhausted</i>) No, honey. We've been over this. You're not a little boy. You're a little girl. Girls can still wear blue, though, so you can have the blue one. You'll see one day, sweetie. You're a girl.<br /><br />Me: (<i>Looking utterly appalled and offended</i>) Why do you have to say that to me? <br /><br />Mom: Because it's true, honey. (<i>Smiles and laughs slightly</i>) You'll see. One day you'll grow up and you'll want to wear skirts and look nice in dresses and you'll even want to wear a bra! (<i>She says this teasingly</i>)<br /><br />Me: No. I won't. <br /><br />Mom: You'll see.<br /><br />Me: <b>You'll</b> see! When I grow up, if I get boobs, I'm cutting them off. <br /><br />&gt;End Scene&lt;<br /><br /><b>IT IS TIME. <br /><br /></b>I can't remember how often it was mentioned when I was younger, that one day I would develop breasts, and that somehow these masses of tissues would usher me into my misplaced femininity. That with them would come a curtsy, painted fingernails and a revolving door of&nbsp; boyfriends. What was never promised to me, however, was that I would <i>want </i>these things. <br /><br />It was embarrassingly late in the game that is Life (not to be confused with Milton Bradley's interpretation, although I would always have men marrying men in that game which will make for another entry another day...) that I realized the biological difference between myself and the neighborhood boys that were my best friends. It was even more embarrassingly late in the game that I realized I was done growing in the area I thought I was just a little behind in... A ""late bloomer,"" as I had heard people that hadn't ""blossomed"" yet be referred to. I thought, for quite some time, that my penis had yet to reach it's potential. This led to many, many, <b>MANY</b> awkward moments in my life (and who are we kidding, still does!). One in particular led to the banishment of showering with my father. Apparently, I asked my mother when my tail was going to grow in ""like Daddy's."" It was tub-time with my sisters only after that. But, that little person grew up and never grew out of desiring things not meant for them. They grew and adapted and compromised and cried and lost themselves and felt lost to themselves. Then, they persevered, built themselves up with a community and found friends, hope and a voice. It's a shaky voice that's still unpredictable and can't carry a tune, but a voice nonetheless. And that awkward voice is making good on a promise made by a child that didn't know any better than to be true to themselves. <br /><br />I am extraordinarily happy to report, I am making good on five-year-old me's promise: <b>I'M GETTING TOP SURGERY.</b><br /><br />The who's and how's and when's are yet to come, but it is a financial certainty, and finances have always been what has stood in the way. I have a letter, I'll have the money; now it's about finding who and when. <br /><br />I cannot express how much I've wanted this. I've dreamed about it so vividly that I cried when I woke up and found myself to still have breasts attached. I've had to go through four agonizing years of binding; the cuts in my shoulders, chronic sweating and unneeded pressure on my bones. Taking off my glasses to look in the mirror because it just doesn't look right, like looking at a child's math paper where two plus two somehow equals five. With everything in you, you know it isn't right. They aren't your rules, you've just come to accept it as a truth that is non-negotiable. Two plus two is four, dammit, and if it isn't, the terrorists win. <br /><br />Thank you to everyone who has supported me emotionally, spiritually, logistically, pragmatically and financially over the years. I would not have been able to keep the spirit of that adamant child alive without you all. I'll post when I know more for sure. <br /><br /><b>WOO-HOO!</b>"

"event","What? That's not how you spend your free time? <br /><br />I'm not working today, so I spent last night writing a pamphlet defining ""transgender"" and listing out resources that I can have at work. I was up until five this morning. I just started going and couldn't stop... Or, I wouldn't let myself stop. Anyway, I'm <i>pretty</i> happy with it. I think the reason I'm so afraid to try to publish anything to to actually write anything is because immediate after I hit the <i>print</i> button, I have complete remorse. No matter what I do, no matter how good it looked to me moments ago on the computer screen, once I hold what I write in my hands I think it's all shit. <br /><br />I worked really hard on this, though. I used things like <i>sources</i> and <i>empirical data</i>. I'm sure it's violating some policy at work, and I won't be allowed to ""hand it out."" But, I think that if I can just have it lying around in some intake rooms, patients that need to see it will. There is also some care standards for transgender individuals that was put out by the organization I work for, but not locally. <br /><br />It is so hard defining things... so I mainly stole a lot from GLSEN. A lot of it was finding the right mix of terms, taking out the stuff that got too technical and picking what was most pertinent to go in. Honestly, my favorite part was doing the layout. I love that stuff. I'm pretty happy with the outcome, but then again, I haven't printed it. <br /><br />I think the most beneficial thing about the pamphlet is that I list local resources for people reading the pamphlet. I tried to think about what I would have benefited from if I knew nothing and walked into the clinic for that information. I'm going to go in to work today to print one off and see what my boss thinks. What? You don't go into work on your day off?"

"event","We live in a duplex, so we share a common wall with our neighbor. Naturally, sharing a wall means you're going to end up sharing some business--whether you want to or not--with your neighbor. We've had the same person living next door to us since February or March, and I have learned more about her in the last three days than any time before.<br /><br />I don't want to put this person's business out there; it's not my business to tell. But, through a few interactions we've had, I've found out that she was recently robbed, has spent some time in prison and will be going to rehab. <br /><br />I ain't one to gossip, so you ain't heard that from me... <br /><br />Several weeks went by when she first moved in, and I had only met her once. We didn't speak any time between that, so I left her a card with our phone numbers so she could reach us in case of an emergency with her or the house. The card also welcomed her, and I told her I would be willing to mow the yard (we live on a freaking hill... the only one in Indiana) if she wanted to throw a few dollars in for gas every so often. We heard back through text message that she would do that, thank you for the offer and that she wanted to split wireless internet with us. So, all of our interactions were very business-like. I knew bits and pieces from the small talk we would make while conducting this business. Her boyfriend doesn't live in the area but pays all of her bills. She's unable to drive and doesn't work. She has a son that she sees every other weekend. Basic stuff.<br /><br />It was so easy to write her off, to see her as part of the house and scenery but not really think too much about it. I mow her grass, I pull down her trashcan and I pick up the garbage and tree limbs that find their way into our yard. I just try to be a ""good"" neighbor. <br /><br />But I'm an asshole because there is some place inside of me that I would never admit to where I think <i>I'm better than her</i>. And I'm not. I'm so, so not better than her. As it goes, the parts of her I judge are the parts that speak some truth to who I am (or who I think you think I am). I just think that at any point in my life, I could have made choices that put me right there with her. After spending some time with her today, I feel compassion and sympathy for her in a very sincere way. I want her to build a plan, stick to it and succeed. I want to help where I can. <br /><br />And, out of necessity, she laid it all out there for me. Her sordid, sad history because she wanted me to watch her place while she went away for a while to rehab. I told her I couldn't and wouldn't judge her, that we're both very liberal people (I was scrambling for a mutual term at that point) that wouldn't think less of her for her past. I'm over myself, and I don't think less of her. <br /><br />I have one question after thinking and mulling the situation over in my head: Would she feel the same compassion if she knew the ""truth"" about me? If she knew my ""history?""<br /><br />I bet some place inside of her that she wouldn't want to admit to, she would think she's better than me. <br /><br /><i>The world owes us nothing<br />We owe each other the world.</i>"

"event","I was confused about something, so I did some research. Turns out, the seasons go as follows:<br /><br />Winter<br />Spring<br />Summer <br />Fall<br /><br />Apparently, thanks to Al Gore, the season formerly known as ""Spring"" has been replaced by ""Summer 2: The Heatening."" <br /><br />Because of this seasonal disruption, it went from being freezing cold in our little duplex of love to be overbearingly warm. We're also having tornado warnings left and right, flash floods and I'm pretty sure I saw the icon for the first of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. This, of course, means that I cannot sleep. We both strip naked, pull all the sheets off and roll as far away from each other as we can (this is how we always slept in Philadelphia when we shared an incredibly small room with absolutely no air conditioning on the third floor of a house in the ghetto). We try to touch pinkie finger-to-arm or foot-to-calf as our way to ""cuddle."" It's just.too.hot.<br /><br />I'm working on a project that I'm pretty excited about with a friend that's in Indy for a while. Since I have a history of not finishing what I start, I'll spare the details for now and we'll see if anything actually comes of it. But I need an artistic project. I still hope to build a darkroom in the very moldy basement this summer, but I do get distracted easily. <br /><br />It's interesting hanging out with friends that knew me before the transition that haven't spent a significant amount of time with me since then. It's coming up on two years now since I've been on testosterone. I was re-reading some posts and was reminded that I will forever have two ""birthdays"" in the month of June. Since we don't know a lot of people here, I called my best friend from high school in Elkhart, and she said she would round up the people still in the area to hang out. These are all people that have a place in my heart, that I carry with me and that helped me to become who I am today. These are also the people that haven't seen too much of me in the last two years, so there's always this ""thing"" that we don't acknowledge. <br /><br />NOT talking about something? Why, I have no idea what that feels like!<br /><br />One of the handful of times I went to therapy, the therapist told me that she was surprised I learned to talk at all with everything my family didn't talk about. I have noticed that I not only want to avoid talking about how I'm feeling, it <i>physically drains me</i> to do it. Seriously, when I have no choice but to talk, I'm often winded and red-faced after the fact. It's just too much. Of course, this means that if you pull out in front of me in your car, I will hang out the window with middle fingers extended and scream bloody murder. It's a fair trade. Anyway, I think it would be fun to spend my birthday with people from the past. We'll see. <br /><br />It seems more and more likely that the student loan idea will work, and I will be able to use that money for top surgery. I'm not sure how long the process will take, but L is meeting with the financial aid adviser soon. I'm still trying to hold back looking into things too seriously in case it doesn't work out, but I can't help but get a little excited. There's been talk about going from California to Canada to Maryland... Each seem to have their own appeal and their own obstacles. I seriously cannot wait. Four years in a binder... Believe me, that's enough!"

"event","A co-worker of mine told me I should watch a movie online called <a href=""http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com""><i>Zeitgeist The Movie</i>.</a> My co-worker caught on to my extreme leftist politics, which I'm not horribly loud about at work but that I also don't shy away from either. Anyway, she doesn't know that I was once plagued with conspiracy theories that led to horrible insomnia and gastrointestinal problems in my earlier stages of life. She thought I would enjoy it as it presents a, well, ""differing"" viewpoint from that of most of the world.<br /> <br /> It literally scared the poop out of me. I now have an ulcer forming that I will have to name <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zeitgeist""><i>Zeitgeist</i> </a>that sits next to <i>Tranny</i>, <i>Divorce</i>, and <i>Student Loans</i>. Welcome to the family.<br /><br />I am not so easily convinced as I once was when it comes to conspiracy theories, so the movie didn't scare me because I think it is all fact. Really, I'm just left feeling unsettled about everything that could be <i>possible. </i><br /><br />Here's the basic synopsis: The documentary is broken down into three parts. In part one, evidence is presented that suggests that Jesus the Son of God is a theological hybrid of Egyptian religion and pagan beliefs that by far pre-date Judeo/Christian beliefs, and a lot of astrology. So, the worship of the ""sun"" became the worship of the ""Son."" This is a really glib synopsis, but the point made is that there is no historical Jesus, definitely no Jesus Christ or higher deity at all. Religion is used to control the masses. Emperor Constantine continued this tradition at the Council of Nicea where Christianity was adopted as the official religion of the empire. The Vatican then took power (insert references to the Inquisition/witch hunts etc.) This is not a shocking proposal to me, however, I feel that one important factor is ignored. <br /><br />One cannot, in my opinion, easily write off the power of belief. Clearly, it doesn't much matter if the concept of Jesus is a hybrid of pagan religions/astrological science or whatever. The belief in the belief comes to outweigh the truth within it. Miracles and faith are not built upon scientific background. It isn't to say that the two are incongruent, and that isn't the point anyway. What matters is that enough people agree upon a reality to make it legitimate and meaningful. Furthermore, I think it's easy to point out where religion has caused great harm and glide over where it has sustained a people and helped guide them to freedom. Cases in point: The 'Church' being a cornerstone for African Americans during the (continual) Civil Rights Movement, Gandhi's use of non-violence as inspired by the ""teachings"" of Jesus Christ. I don't think I'm being very clear with what I'm attempting to say, but at this point it is 4 in the morning, so give me a break.<br /><br />The second section of the movie was dedicated to proving that 9/11 was an inside job. I'm not smart enough to know how factual what is being presented is, but suffice it to say that it's sad when we are living in a time where we would have to even <i>question</i> our governments involvement on an attack of its own people. The reason there is so much focus on 9/11in the doc is to prove that a religious stronghold and unchallenged patriotism and Nationalism will lead to fear and surrender. Part three focuses on how we will all have microchips implanted as a means of total government control because we're so manipulated and afraid as explained in parts 1 and 2. <br /><br />The irony? Making a documentary film that will obviously play upon the fears and emotions of those watching it, making it accessible to anyone with a computer who would most likely not be able have access to the research materials to either confirm or debunk suspicions in order to convince them that they should not obey like sheep but if they don't revolt they will clearly be enslaved. There is a <i>Zeitgeist: Addendum</i> that is coming in October 2008 to specifically tell us all what we should do in order to combat these alarming revelations. Let us hope that we make it until then as a society so the director of this film can tell us how to stop the apocalypse (which he doesn't even believe in).<br /><br />Also, don't point out that the book of Revelation tells us that we will have to have some type of bar-code placed on our forehead or hand which will be considered the ""mark of the beast."" He explains this away as self-fulfilled prophecy which only readies people for what they come to believe is inevitable. ...y'know, like making a movie about a totalitarian government that will come to power and eat your children. <br /><br />And after all that, after two hours of listening to and watching disturbing images about a very bleak future, there is literally 3 minutes devoted to keeping the razor blade away from your wrist. Do you know what he says? Guess.<br /><br />LOVE CONQUERS FEAR.<br /><br />Why not just make a fucking movie with Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts where a befuddled British guy with bad teeth overcomes his fear of pit bulls in order to win the love and affection of an ugly-turned-hot pit bull trainer. Love conquers fear there too, a-hole. <br /><br />Really, though, it scared the poop out of me and prompted me not to crawl in bed next to the one I love, but rather stay away and write a stupid livejournal to myself until I use sarcasm and cynicism to shield me from any truth that may actually be in the film. <br /><br />I am no patriot, but I am an American. I like my beer cold, my chicks hot and my Jesus almighty. I don't want to feel like the bastard child of the Messiah that dropped us off at the mall one day and really isn't coming back. <br /><br />I'm not saying I know. I'm saying I believe in possibility. In that, I find freedom and peace.<br /><br />I'd be interested in talking with anyone that has seen it or watches it to get opinions. <br /><br />Okay. That's enough. Look at me posting twice in a row. Record setting!"

"event","I suppose that each year around my birthday, I feel the need to update one of my twelve online journals and reflect upon the last year of my life. I believe this is my sixth year of having a Livejournal -not this one- but in total. It's interesting to be able to look back at six years of your life chronicled. I'm not sure how I feel about it yet. 

I think I stopped updating both of my journals for a few reasons. I think I wasn't so much into writing in this one because my transition is at a standstill. There are things I could have written about (like when I ""lectured"" at my old college regarding gender etc.) and emotions/growths related to the transition. But every time I go into a bookstore, there's a new book about a trans guy's journey into whatever, and I just fail to see the point. There's only so much that can fit on a table, and I think that Judith Butler has a pretty nice spread. 

Really, I feel like I was invited to a party and I asked, ""Should I bring anything?"" Then they said, ""Oh, sure."" So I show up with some store bought cookies and Faygo and Martha Stewart answers the door. Crap.

And ain't it a bitch that I don't feel like I fit into the trans community? It's like I'm living my life as the ""bee girl"" from the Blind Melon video and I'm searching and searching for all the other bee costume people that like to tap dance. Only, my life is a lot longer than two minutes and there has yet to be a happy resolution where I find all my like-minded bee friends. And what's more depressing is that the lead singer of Blind Melon overdosed and died many years ago, so I don't really think he ever found the shiny happy bee people. But I believe they're out there... and worth looking for.

I digress.

I think after four years of binding that there may actually be light at the end of the tunnel for me. My partner has the ability to take out some students loans that may actually pay for the surgery which would be INCREDIBLE and only illustrates her generosity and trust. Since it is impossible for me to save any money, I refused to let myself believe top surgery would happen for me any time soon. All of the money I make goes to paying rent/phone/electric/gas/credit card and those wonderful gas prices out there. I will soon be responsible for another vehicle. My partner works part time but is going back to school full time and that is her focus (and should be!). She just finished her first semester with ALL A'S and I couldn't be more proud! So, financially, it has been impossible and impractical to save anything. This student loan idea seems to be a good one, since the interest would be low. It's the first tangible opportunity that has presented itself so far, and I'm starting to let myself think it may actually happen. 

Of course, this presents a number of problems. 

1. Since I'm stealth at work, how do I explain the aftermath of the surgery? (Why I can't lift heavy things for a while or why I'm sore)

2. Having enough Paid Time Off.

3. Finding a surgeon working with a very specific budget.

4. Paying back the money when all is said and done.

5. Planning for how my family will react. 

All of these concerns are manageable, and I'm doing my best not to stress out about anything. I'm working on planning instead of impulsively deciding or making last minute decisions. I'm trying to prevent instead of react. It's much harder than it looks, like walking with a book on your head or brushing your teeth twice a day. Okay, maybe not brushing your teeth twice a day. That's pretty easy. 

And since I have insomnia and haven't updated in forever, I'm just going to keep right on going. 

Being in Naptown (I had NO IDEA that Indianapolis was called Naptown, and I don't think I even like it - much like I don't like calling Chicago Chi Town... but I guess I'll do the hipster thing and use it anyway) has allowed me to interact more with my family. I've been able to get to know my sisters a lot better, more as people and less as siblings. I'm really glad about this, even if I know things I didn't want to know because it makes them real people. And me real people, too. 

We've all been talking a lot lately about our childhood and some of the disturbing memories we each carry. It's almost like a fiction novel where the same story is being laid out by three entirely different authors with entirely different styles and perspectives/interpretations. Matthew, Mark and Luke if you will. But we all three remember similar things, and I think for the first time we want to talk about them. We want to figure it out, to gain understanding and grow and let go. It's a really healthy place to be, but it's a difficult struggle. It makes you admit things that maybe you don't want to admit. 

I love my mother. She gave birth to me, sacrificed a lot in her one (as far as I know) life to provide and care for me the best way she knew how. My father, too. I don't want to complain about her, but I do want to understand. And most of all, I want to be heard and believed. My mother is not the same person she was when she had her three children as a child herself. I recognize this, and I'm glad that she's made decisions that she feels are in her best interest. What I cannot accept, and what I deplore is her complete and utter denial of anything from the past that doesn't fit with her newly found image. My sisters, I've come to learn, feel the same way. 

Again, we all talk about it differently and with different emotions. I think it enrages one of us, saddens another and one of us tries to make themselves another David Sedaris or Augusten Burroughs. If you know us, you know which pertains to each person. My guess is that D. Sedaris and A. Burroughs still think back to their childhoods, to those memories that make the world at large laugh and shudder at the same time, and they cry. They then wipe away their tears with money which they earned for having those horrible things happen to them, which is the biggest difference between them and myself. That, and talent, but I'm rambling. 

As much as I don't want to, I carry those feelings and memories with me. When my sisters and I talk about things, we often burst out into laughter. I think it's a defense mechanism, I think it's because it's awkward and I think it's in part, too, because it's disturbingly funny.&nbsp; We keep each other sane and in check when it comes to our childhood memories, and I'm thankful that they are there to assure me that I'm not crazy. They validate me. I'm so thankful to have that here. I think I want to talk about the specifics, but not yet. 

So, I'm turning 25... thought I'd leave another bread crumb back to myself for when I turn 26... if Bush doesn't doom us all by then."

"event","I had to repeat my pap-smear since the first test was found to be inconclusive. This is common among women, but more common among FTM's since the testosterone injections make it so that my body produces less cells used for testing for HPV. The AIDS test and all the other STI tests came back negative (yay me). <br /><br />I went back to the&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.feministcenter.org/"">Feminist Health Center</a> by myself this time since I knew what to expect. Like last time, I went to the bulletproof glass and sat down, filled out a form and was thanked for being early. I went to sit in the waiting area to be called back. Last time, there were queer magazines to look at, but all I saw were <i>Southern Living</i> and others that weren't of interest to me. I wasn't going to read any, but I decided I may as well leaf through one. When I picked it up, a huge bundle of stapled papers fell out. I didn't even look through them, I just scanned the first page and saw in bold print, <b>""They're going to take your baby.""</b> Immediately, I removed the packet and brought it to the front and slid it underneath the glass and told the woman that I had found it in the magazines and I didn't think it was appropriate. <br /><br />She said thank you and told me that if my exam wasn't already free that she wouldn't have charged me. I helped her go through all the other magazines (there were four or five more packets hidden) and the children's books. Whoever had left the packets also left a bible on the floor. I'm so used to seeing bibles in waiting rooms I didn't think anything of it, but I handed it to her and said, ""I'm not sure if you put this literature out."" I'm sure that certain passages were underlined. I'm glad that I found the packets instead of a woman there for the center's abortion services.<br /><br />The receptionist said that before I had arrived, there was a young, pregnant woman that came with a friend. She had a sonogram and then stole the picture (they weren't sure why...). Her friend had waited for her and most likely tucked the packets of info into the magazines before she bolted. She told me that things like that don't generally happen. I'm surprised there isn't more protesting outside of the clinic.<br /><br />Anyway, the second test went fine. I am absolutely in <b>LOVE</b> with my doctor, <a href=""http://www.feministcenter.org/Health_Care/atlanta-gynecologist.html"">Dr. Chris Turner</a>. She is so kind and thoughtful, and wants so badly to offer the best care available for trans patients. She even ordered a different tool that is more slender with FTM patients in mind. We talked for about 20 minutes after she had collected the sample about trans issues and about how glad it makes her that she's involved in the community. I had sent her an e-mail after our first visit, thanking her for being so amazing. I asked if she had received it and she said yes, and that it made her cry. She said it wasn't often that patients sent anything directly to her, thanking her, and she said she was very touched. She hugged me before she left.<br /><br />She also said that she was thinking about offering night visits one day a week for trans patients seeking care. Since it is a ""woman's"" health clinic, it stands that if you're there for health treatment, you're a woman. It makes it awkward for trans patients that would prefer to remain stealth, and the last thing a trans person needs is another excuse or reason not to seek health care. I told her I thought it was a good idea. If you're an FTM in Atlanta, I highly recommend her and the Feminist Health Center. They have a trans guy as a liaison that you can contact to set up an appointment. He's a good guy, although he's not great at getting back to you so you may have to write him several times. His name is <a href=""mailto:jacc@feministcenter.org"">Jac</a>."

"event","A very good, very trusted friend and I just exchanged a series of e-mails that caused a complete epiphany for me, and I wanted to process. Before making the decision to physically transition, I agonized for years about whether or not I should, if this was the path I should take, etc. I ignored it as long as I could, and then on January 15th (05) I had a dream that literally changed my life. I immediately woke from the dream, picked up my notebook and wrote it down. Even before I was fully conscious, I somehow understood the gravity of what had happened, and I knew I had to make a record of it.<br /><br />If you're interested to re-read it or never have, it's under the cut.<br /><br /><div text=""dream"" class=""ljcut"">i was riding a three wheeler (we called them ""big wheels"" when we were younger) around my old neighborhood in pinecrest, only i was 21. i saw myself doing it, and it looked rather ridiculous; my knees were up to my head. anyway, i was riding this big wheel to the house i lived most of my life in. i walked in, and the house was made up of a culmination of houses that have had some sort of impact on me throughout my life. there were parts from the actual house in pinecrest, parts from adam's house, gerri's house, granny's trailer and many more. there was this little boy sitting at the table, books out like he was doing his homework. he was six, perhaps seven and had dark blond or light brown hair and big, brown eyes. he looked up and smiled at me, so i sat down next to him. i knew there was a reason i was there; i think there had been some incident i had witnessed that made me want to check on the boy, but i don't remember. he began talking to me immediately like he recognized me. he was telling me that he was going to have a birthday party soon and he had hung fliers to invite people to his birthday, but they had been torn down. he spoke with such expression and was very animated. there was no trembling in his voice to suggest that the removal of his signs had upset him, he was simply letting me know. he planned, then, to hand out candy the next day when he invited people. this made me smile. i asked when his birthday was, and he said either june 5th or 6th but he never remembered. it occurred to me in the dream that june 6th was my birthday, but it didn't feel important. i told him i would come to his birthday party and bring him a present, but he told me all he wanted was for me to attend. i smiled bigger, and i hugged him. i felt the hug, another uncommon occurrence that rarely happens in my dream state. then i heard voices, presumably his parents, coming from the other room. it was like a charlie brown cartoon because i never saw their bodies or even knew where their voices were coming from. they made a comment about my age, i don't know what they said or exactly why they said it. i said, ""i'm 21 if that makes a difference."" one of the voices replied, ""well, good luck becoming a full grown boy."" i smiled one last time at the boy and walked out of the house and returned to my transportation of choice, the trusty big wheel, and began peddling down the driveway. the rest of the dream blurs from this moment.<br /><br />when you're quiet, you're able to listen. i've been practicing that the past few weeks, trying to find me in all the noise. a wise person informed me that i should began listening to myself. my therapist told me i need to trust myself. <br /><br />more than anything, i feel myself coming to a division in several paths i'm on. normally, i'd stay the course; better to know what lies ahead even if you're so tired of the journey you're on. i don't feel that way anymore. it is time i made some decisions in my life, no matter what the consequences of those decisions are. it's time that certain parts of me grew into who i've always known them to be, a maturation i've put off as long as possible. but it's time, i think.</div><br />My amazing friend wrote to tell me that she had an experience where her father told her he wouldn't want her newborn son to be l/g/b/t because of the stigma he would face. She said (remember that she's amazing) that hopefully that wouldn't be an issue anymore when he would come to identify, and that it is our job to be a voice and a ""catalyst for change."" I love her dearly. Then she went on to ask her father what he would think should her son be a transsexual, should he identify as a woman. As if this were not courageous enough (I would have peed myself), she told him about me, my journey and how much she felt my experiences were ""authentic."" This e-mail came after a couple of difficult interactions that left me feeling like I had done something wrong by choosing the path I did, but not because I had made the wrong choice for myself. I felt, for a brief moment, that I had betrayed the women I love so much around me by abandoning them, the movement, feminism in general. <br /><br />I explained this to my wise, insightful friend and she wrote something back to me that made me think about the dream. (It's all coming full-circle, I promise). She said that it irritated her that other people process the issues they have with my journey with me. And I realized just <i>how much</i> I let other people tell me they have a problem with me. I thought back to that little boy, so determined and hopeful, and how his combative strategy was not to ""fight back"" in any conventional way, but to hand out candy; sugar with the medicine, a little laughter with the bad news. I'm willing, perhaps to a fault, to give people space and time to have issues with who I am or the choices I have made. <br /><br />But I'm that little boy, wanting to make everyone happy no matter what it takes. <br /><br />I remember a line from a poem I wrote once about my parents and what I had learned from them, and I wrote that ""love instigates a sacrifice..."" But I shouldn't have to sacrifice that which makes me whole, and I shouldn't have to apologize for it, either. <br /><br />Thank you for your always thought-provoking words. They remind me that I am loved, and that's a really good reminder."

"event","Sometimes I forget things. Sometimes I forget important things. Like my one year anniversary of being on testosterone. That happened June 29th. I forget other things, too. I forget that I didn't grow up as a little boy. I don't think this is a big deal at all; in fact, more often than not I feel blessed to have had the experiences I have had. However, not growing up a ""little boy"" and being perceived as a man make for some, well, ""consistency"" issues.<br /><br />Here are (paraphrased) things that have actually come out of my mouth when I had to quickly explain away something in my past that wouldn't have made sense in my present. All of these incidences are with patients from my job.<br /><br />Patient: What possessed you to get your ears pierced?<br />Me: Well, I didn't put much thought into it. I was five.<br />Patient: What?!<br />Me: (Shitfuckdamn) Yeah, well...<br />Patient: Do you have hippie parents or something?<br />Me: Nah. I have two older sisters who had theirs pierced, so I threw a fit until my parents let me get one done. I pierced the other one later.<br /><br />Patient: Do you have knee problems?<br />Me: Yeah, I played sof... I was a catcher.<br />Patient: Did you play college ball?<br />Me: Not exactly.<br /><br />Patient: Are you married?<br />Me: Not yet. Thinking about it though, but who knows?<br />Patient: Any kids?<br />Me: Nope. No kids. Not planning on it anytime soon, either.<br />Patient: Well, sometimes you don't plan on it. Ha ha.<br />Me: (under my breath) Oh, I think we'd really have to work at it.<br /><br />Patient: Why is your skin so soft?<br />Me: I exfoliate.<br /><br />Patient: How do you spell your name?<br />Me: With a 'K'.<br />Patient: It looks like you signed it, ""Kim.""<br />Me: No, it's Kris, with a K.<br />Patient: Why with a K? What's is short for?<br />Me: Kristopher. My dad is really Dutch. (Why did I just say <i>really</i> like that is some quantifier?) The Dutch way to spell Kristopher is with a K. (Is that even true?)<br />Patient: Oh, okay.<br /><br />Male Patient: You ever just rip one that's so long you think it will never end?<br />Me: Uh. Um. No?<br /><br />At first, making up a history was hard, but I think I'm getting better. If not better, more creative. Pretty soon I'll be able to do this on the spot:<br /><br />Patient: How long have you been doing this?<br />Me: About fifteen years.<br />Patient: What? How old are you?<br />Me: 33.<br />Patient: What?!<br />Me: I'm IMMORTAL.<br />"

I am, however, finally growing in that bad-ass, rebellious teenage mustache. It's a bit blotchy, a bit tri-colored if you will, but it is MINE and I worked very hard to grow it. 

Transitioning this past year has been filled with a lot of mood swings, angry teenage outbursts, awkward feelings and a lot of acne. It's also been filled with a lot of understanding, positive changes and support. I feel blessed that I've been able to meet the people I've met and I was able to be in a place where I had no history to work through.

"event","I'm sure that going home is an interesting experience for most people, depending on how long they've been gone away. It's a truly interesting experience to leave a place where everyone knows you as a girl and come back a boy/esque. Being at home with my family was like a time warp back into a life that I was once a part of. <br /><br />Living here, away from anyone that knew me before (aside from my partner) was probably the best/worst move I could have made. Worst because of all the hardship, but best in terms of getting myself together emotionally and physically. I had nothing I had to live down here; I have always been ""Kris,"" with only as much past as I choose to explain to people. Of course, that isn't the case at home. There was this whole other path I was on there, but not as an entirely different person. <br /><br />Going home reaffirmed for me that I am still the same dorky person that I always was. Thank god I haven't lost that! My friends were, for the most part, amazing. They asked a lot of questions that I haven't been asked in a while, now that I have entered another ""taken for granted"" reality where it is assumed that I am and always have been... They made a lot of comments that surprised me or made me think in a new way.<br /><br />""Are you straight now?""<br /><br />-No. I'm still queer. It's just <i>who</i> I am. That hasn't changed. I couldn't be straight if I wanted to be, I don't think. Although, I'd never want to. I know it doesn't make sense if I identify as a transguy, a boi, FTM etc., but it is my identity. It is my politics and my heart. For me, my gender and the gender of my partner do not dictate my sexuality. I grew up queer, much like I grew up girl. I considered myself blessed to have grown up as both for the tremendous insight and strength I have gained. <br /><br />""If I didn't know anything before I saw you, I would probably think you were a gay boy.""<br /><br />-Okay. There are worse things people could think about me. <br /><br />""I don't mean to offend you, but...""<br /><br />-You won't. You won't offend me with your questions or your comments. I know this is new, and for a lot of people, scary and different. I take my life like I take my margaritas: with a lot of salt. It's okay to mess up on the pronouns. It's okay to use my full name when telling a story about the past because it is my past. I do not intend to erase them because they don't fit into this ""new"" conception of who I am. Everyone needs to take time with things, and I think that eventually it will come more naturally to the people from my past once they get to know me more here, in the present.<br /><br />""Can I see?""<br /><br />-Probably not. And, depending on who you are, hell no. I can answer questions anyone has about my specific person without problem. And I won't be offended. However, I am not a toy or an object that can be poked and prodded and past around. I am still a person, my private business still my private business. There are plenty of sites on the internet that shows it all if you're interested. You do not need to see my specific parts. I have some pretty frank friends.<br /><br />There were some that glossed over the obvious changes, the most blatant being my voice, either because they didn't care or didn't know what to say. It really was only a big deal to me because I worried for a long time about what people would think or if it would matter at all. I feel a lot more comfortable now because I know that the people in my past who remember me will be okay with it, and the people that I didn't know too well probably won't recognize me anyway. <br /><br />I don't think that I was ""born into the wrong body."" This is my body, adaptable and malleable. I grew up, for the most part, being treated like and living like a girl. For the last year, I have lived as and have been treated like a boy. And there is a difference, but I maintain (more or less) a cultural one. But knowing what I know, being able to recognize the difference and listening to conversations on both ends, I feel blessed more than cursed, right more than wrong. When in my almost 24 years have I ever chose an easy path? <br /><br />""Without struggle, there is no progress."" Frederick Douglass<br /><br />"

I know i gave you ways that we could prevent this, however sometimes it still occurs. It doesn't mean anything is wrong or there are any problems, it just means the HPV testing could not be preformed at the lab.

Most clients are unwilling for obvious reasons. This is the treatment that post menopausal women receive when there paps are unreadable. Basically the cells around the cervix become scant with the lack of estrogen in the body, and the estrogen treatment would allow enough&nbsp;cells to develop for us to retreive an ideal sample.&nbsp;Let me know if you are willing to do any or all of this.

I know that it would bring about an ideal sample, but I don't think I could deal with more ""discharge"" as I tend to try to pay as little attention to that area as possible.

If not, though, I don't think I can make myself go through that again. I understand that it wasn't anyone's fault, and I don't mean to be difficult by not taking the estrogen... the whole thing is traumatizing enough without dealing with the effects of additional hormones, you know? <br /><br />I appreciate hearing back from you about this.

"event","For the first time in my 23 years of existing, I went to a gynecologist. Apparently, this is something that should happen when you start having sex, or at least when you're 18. Either way, it was a long, long overdue visit. I tried to go in Philadelphia at the Mazzoni Center, but it never happened for me for whatever reason. So, I figure I was meant to go here for whatever reason.<br /><br />Several months ago, I contacted the <a href=""http://www.feministcenter.org"">Feminist Women's Health Clinic </a>to set up at appointment. I looked on their website and found that they specifically offer trans health care. What that exactly means, no matter where you go, is opaque. I contacted the name listed for trans health care, and exchanged e-mails and phone calls with a very nice, very thorough woman.<br /><br />In order to get testosterone prescriptions through the FWHC, I had to be diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder, even though every single person I dealt with regarding T, health and even my psychologist agreed that the GID diagnosis is BULLSHIT. They referred me to a psychologist, and I made an appointment. I can't remember the exact cost of the visit with the psychologist, but she was amazing. In case you're in Atlanta and are seeking a therapist that is trans-compassionate, check out <a href=""http://www.virginiaerhardt.com/"">Dr. Virginia Erhardt</a>. I'm not sure if you need a referral, but if you do, you can always go through the FWHC. Dr. Erhardt knew I was BROKE, and met with me only one time to make the diagnosis. We spoke before hand, and she told me that she couldn't promise me a diagnosis after one visit, but at this point I was already on testosterone and I had been seeing a therapist in Philadelphia. I suppose every person is unique. I had to answer SEVERAL questions prior to entering her office, and we went over my answers to those questions. They were mainly about gender, how I view my gender and an overall feel of how I view myself. Based on one meeting with me, she diagnosed me with GID, and waived the $60 fee she normally charges for writing the letter of diagnosis to her contact at FWHC stating that I could be prescribed testosterone.<br /><br />After this, I was really broke and couldn't afford to go to the FWHC for a gynecological appointment.<br /><br />Several months go by, and my financial situation is looking ""up,"" at least temporarily. I contact the FWHC again, was put in communication with the trans liaison and set up an appointment.<br /><br />The building is discreet because they perform/offer abortion services. Lillian came with me because I was nervous, but I had already told her that I didn't want her coming back with me. This was just my preference; I don't think I could live knowing someone I see daily saw me like that. If Lil is ever going to see me with my feet in stirrups, it better be because I'm tied up and ball gagged and she's in leather. I digress...<br /><br />The waiting room was actually cool for a couple of reasons. First, there was great photography on the walls, not that reproduced crap you would find in hotels or those motivational sunset photos you see in offices. Secondly, they had the Michelle Rodriguez cover edition of Curve magazine. I've never been to a doctor's office that had a lesbian magazine as an option. I've always had to entertain myself with Highlights, trying to find that damn toothbrush hidden in the bark of a tree. Anyway, the trans liaison, Jac, came out to meet with me. He was a really cool guy, and walked through the process with me.<br /><br />On top of a gynecological examination, as if that wasn't going to be fun enough for me, I was also going to have a breast exam, my hormone levels/blood drawn and an STI/STD test. You're supposed to call them ""STI's"" instead of ""STD's"" now, since most sexually transmitted ""diseases"" are really infections and that word carries less stigma. Thank god for our ever-changing flow of liberal consciousness.<br /><br />They told me to pee in a cup, which I knew I wasn't going to be able to do. I have severe anxiety surrounding bathrooms, and a freakishly shy bladder on top of that. So, after ten minutes of trying, I left the bathroom and found Jac. He said not to worry about it and they started drawing blood. I think I had to give them about five vials full, but it was no big deal since they only have to stick you once. By the grace of god I have kick ass veins, so that went smoothly.<br /><br />Jac brought me back to the room for the gyno/breast exam. He introduced me to Dr. Turner, who had stayed late in order to do my exam. Dr. Turner was so pleasant and made me feel comfortable. I had to change into a gown, but I stayed in my boxers until I absolutely had to take them off. Dr. Turner asked if I wanted Jac or my gf to come back during the exam, and of course I said hell no. But it was thoughtful for her to ask.<br /><br />The best exam was no big deal. I basically forget that I even have them until I have to remember, and all she did was apply a gentle amount of pressure, move her two fingers in a circular motion and went from my arm pit to my sternum like a grid. Lil does monthly breast exams on me (I'm hella paranoid b/c I have been binding for several years now) so this wasn't really that weird. I didn't look at her hands, and she talked to me and kept eye contact the whole time.<br /><br />And then came the fun part. By fun, of course, I mean like the sort of fun being punched in the face is. I had to remove my boxers and put my heels in the stirrups and scoot my butt to the very end of the table. Yee freaking haw. Dr. Turner asked me if I wanted to see the tools that she was going to be using, and I said no thank you. She explained to me what she was going to be doing quickly before she started so I wouldn't be shocked or surprised at anything.<br /><br />So, the tool they use to jack the car up, so to speak, was placed in. Apparently, though, something inside of me is ""tilted,"" and because of this, Dr. Turner had to switch to a bigger tool that is longer. I'm thinking, at this point, that I should get dinner out of this. Dr. Turner kept apologizing over and over again for having to use the tool twice (which meant in, out, in and another eventual out), and I actually had to reassure her that it was okay and I was okay. I honestly felt how much she cared and how little she wanted to put me through this. Once she was where she needed to be, she told me I had a ""good looking cervix."" I didn't know what to say to this, having never been a compliment like that... ever... But, I guess my cervix is a hot piece of ass, so be jealous. Gross.<br /><br />She said that I would feel ""pressure"" next, but I felt a scraping sensation. It didn't hurt, but I had a reaction to it like the reaction I have to nails on a chalkboard. I was doing my deep breathing exercises that I learned to help with my anxiety, and it really helped. Dr. Turner was as quick as possible acquiring her sample, and then she said that she had to use her finger. She said that she only uses one with trans patients, two otherwise.<br /><br />This is basically lesbian sex, albeit very short lesbian sex. But really, the only difference is that she's wearing gloves (which isn't a difference for some freaky couples... know what I'm sayin'?).<br /><br />That was it. I survived and I didn't even have a mental breakdown. Jac met with me after the billing (in total, it all cost $171) to kind of debrief. All I need to do is write him for a script. Done and done.<br /><br />Here's what I really appreciated:<br /><br />1. The constant amount of checking in that everyone did to make sure I was feeling okay, doing okay, if I had any questions.<br />2. They gave me as many options as they could, which also gave me the feeling that I had more control. It helped.<br />3. They have a trans liaison.<br />4. The paperwork asked me how I identified sexually, and ""queer"" was an option.<br />5. I could put down my preferred pronoun.<br /><br />I think that all those things should be standard with all health care. But that's just me.<br /><br />Anyway, that's my experience. I'm meeting with a lawyer tomorrow to get my name changed. We'll see how it goes!<br /><br />After the name change, the next step is chest surgery! Woohoo! <br />"

"event","I had adult acne prior to beginning testosterone. It wasn't fun, but it was manageable. Now, nine months later, my face has exploded. 

EXPLODED.

Oddly enough, the only clear space on my entire face is my forehead. My forehead was the one place I had acne when I went through my first round of puberty. 

I never ""took care"" of my face. Part of it was because I didn't have any discipline. Another part was that I didn't care. I was 13-20 and it didn't matter as much because it was still an appropriate age for me to have acne. Now, heading toward the big 24, I would like to distance myself as much as possible from all things that label me a teen. And believe me, there are plenty of things (my size, my voice, my clothes). 

So, I did some research, and I found some helpful information on Acne.org. I decided to give The Regimen (it's a little weird that it's capitalized, kind of like the Bible is capitalized) a try. 

This guy named Dan Kern had acne and he tried a million products. He eventually went on Accutane (which can make you go crazy and kill yourself or can make your baby be born with three arms or some other crazy defect) but has since concocted a regimen that works for a lot of people. 

So, right now I'm washing my face with a cleanser, applying benzoyl peroxide and then using a moisturizer. I'm also taking a barrage of supplements. 

Every day I will be taking: Zinc, vitamin D (D3) and Flax Oil (vegetarian option to get Omega 3). 

I'm hoping this will work. On top of feeling awkward because of the testosterone, I'm really embarrassed about my acne. And it's hard to hide your face... I even had a woman at work comment on how bad my skin was. Who does that? Apparently...

I'm also taking St. John's Wort to try to help with some of my mood... um, ""issues."" Maybe it will help.

"event","So, here's the thing. I'm bad at keeping up with this journal. 

I've been on testosterone now for... going on nine months. My voice is completely different, my weight is starting to shift (at least, I'm convincing myself that's the case when really, I could just be getting fat) and I'm slowly but surely gaining some facial hair. As far as my mood goes, it's still difficult to tell what's hormonal and what's just ordinary depression. Regardless of the reason, I'm a total bastard lately. And not a ""normal"" total bastard, like a cycle that every one experiences now and again. I wish it was a switch I could just flip that would make me not such a jerk, but I can't. Even when I know I'm being a tool, it just feels like I can't get out of it. Like running in sand almost. 

And good god almighty, the acne! I forgot how much fun it was. I wasn't even done with it when I started testosterone, and now it's gone crazy. It hurts to shave over, it itches and it spreads like wildfire. I feel diseased sometimes... So, it's a catch-22 at this point: I feel awkward not on testosterone, and awkward on it. 

There is a large community of transgender persons here, however, I do not belong to that community. This is, in fact, my fault. I would like to go to a support group, but I work the night that the one I would attend meets, and honestly, I don't really fit with the trans persons I've met here. I don't feel like I fit with anyone. This doesn't help things and just adds to the constant feeling of loneliness and desperation. 

I am passing in every setting except a gay setting, although I don't do anything differently than I did before. It's funny dealing with different people every night I work and seeing how they read me. Sometimes I'm treated like a gay guy, and a lot of times I'm treated like some super nerd. I had one patient that literally said something along those lines. He&nbsp; had a military career and implied that if god hadn't given me height and size, surely I was some sort of super intelligence. Also, a patient asked another tech about me and referred to me as that ""dorky"" guy.&nbsp; I'm quite all right with that label. 

I went to a psychiatrist here to be diagnosed with GID, even though I don't believe in it. This way, the local (and ironic) women's health center will supply me with hormones once I run out, but now I'm not even sure I will be using their services. At least this way, I've already been diagnosed. It was good to meet with a psychiatrist, even if it was once, to discuss things. It served me like it was a check-in, and I didn't compromise what I truly think about gender/gender presentation/roles when I talked with her. It was all right, although I hope it's not something I have to do again simply because I don't want to pay for another appointment. 

I have no regrets about starting testosterone, and I'm actively looking for ways to get top surgery. There always seems to be something that eats away my money no matter what. 

My family remains supportive, each person in their own way. My sister is pregnant with her first child, due in early May, and she's referring me as Unkie. I appreciate the effort. My mother is still... I love my mother. We'll leave it there. My other sister and her husband and son are good to me, and my dad too. It's difficult because they're so far away, but hopefully that will change at some point. 

I guess that's about it. If anyone still reads this and they have a specific question, post it. I promise I won't wait six months to get back to you."

"event","It's been a few months, so I thought I'd write a little update. I decided midway through detailing every change that was occurring with my mind and body that I really didn't want to. There are countless websites out there that detail the journey of The Trans, and mine wouldn't really bring anything new to the table. When I was living in Philadelphia, I wanted to make sure that the people I lectured to (I used to get to lecture) knew where there were transgender resources around the city. I now live in Atlanta and really know nothing about the trans scene here. I've been here four months and I've met a grand total of four people, two of which are in my girlfriend's family. I can honestly say my physical transition is easier than relocating has been.

I've been on testosterone since June 29th, which would make it over four months now. My voice is completely different, my jaw is more pronounced and lately I've been having what I think were ""growing pains"" in my legs, but who knows? There was about a three week period where I was a total hormonal monster, but it's been difficult to distinguish what has been testosterone induced and what I can attribute to run-of-the-mill, everyday depression. I'm sure it's cyclical. 

My girlfriend has been supportive, patient and understanding. I still have semi-frequent contact with my family back in IN, and as far as I can tell, coming out to them really hasn't changed much. I don't live anywhere near there, so I don't know if there will be problems when I visit for x-mas. I don't anticipate that there will be. I miss them too much sometimes. 

I pass at my place of employment 100%. It's not my intention to go stealth (to pass all the time). I'm just referred to as ""he"" and ""him"" and I don't say anything. I wouldn't say anything if they said ""she"" or ""her"" either. 

I bought new glasses from Lens Crafters, and they have a deal where you can ""See Now, Pay Later."" The whole time I was in the store, they addressed me as ""sir,"" and the guy (who was horribly, horribly awkward) that assisted me with finding the frames I wanted in black asked me if I wanted sign up for the deal. I said yes, not fully understanding what exactly it was. Basically, I opened up a line of credit. In order to do this, he had to see my driver's license. I was nervous to give it to him, being that it has my fully first name and middle name printed across the top, not to mention a big, fat F under ""sex."" He took it, had to look over it because it's an IN license and he didn't know where all the information was, and handed it back to me. He then marked, ""Male"" on the computer under ""Gender"" and wrote my chosen name. Either he is not perceptive or he understood something. I'll go with option A. Still, it was an interesting experience. 

I'm really lacking a community here, and it's taking its toll. I miss giving lectures with the Bryson Institute like I did in Philadelphia. I miss being around like-minded individuals instead of straight men that think I want into their world. Thank you, but I really don't. And, honestly, you don't want me there. I mean, I'll write down the code so I can get in, but you won't want me to stay long and I'll start bringing guests without asking. I'll eat everything in the fridge and I won't offer to replace it. Really. I just want to be around some progressive FTM's and I want my girlfriend to meet some transgender partners so she can have people to talk to. 

Anyway, that's about it. If anyone still reads this and has a specific question for me, please feel free to comment and ask. Otherwise, I'll probably post in another two months unless I remember about this journal before that."

"event","well, like my body, my life is in transition which accounts for the huge gap in writing journal entries. i know i have just thousands of people hanging on my every word, so i apologize for keeping you all in suspense. *ahem* right. so, anyway.

i did my second injection of testosterone. i need to have a little more faith in myself. lil and i followed all the steps correctly, but there were tiny little bubbles. we weren't sure if they would kill me, so i tried to do it again, missed a step, freaked out and then decided to do it the next day. talk about paranoid. but, the next morning, everything went fine and i've lived so far so i assume i did things correctly.&nbsp;

right now, i'm in sylva, north carolina. i've spent the last two weeks house sitting for lil's mom 3,000 feet on a mountain. i'm using dial up to connect to the internet, which may explain why i haven't updated about anything, gender related or not. this has been such a huge culture shock, moving from big liberal philly to little conservative (for the most part) sylva that we have decided to move. again. to atlanta, georgia. there's a chance we may live there. a much better chance than here. it isn't that i don't want a challenge, i just don't think i'm ready for this big of a challenge. and there are actually medical centers in atlanta that know what ""trans"" is and won't poke at me with a stick while the diagnosis is ""what the&nbsp;fuck is this thing?""

you see my point, i'm sure.

there have been some minor and more major physical changes since i began testosterone. i have hair growing on my upper thigh and there's hair filling in spaces on my legs where there wasn't any before. i took pictures at the two week mark, and i decided to take pictures every two weeks. i have one voice ""clip"" that i'm saving to my phone until i can get a microphone or program to save it to my computer. i can't tell if it's changed yet, so if it has it's only a slight change. the biggest change has happened to what i call my ""little guy."" my ""little guy"" has grown *exponentially* and i'm a little afraid that it's growing to fast. at this rate, it will take over tokyo. look for it and a lot of terrified japanese on your five o'clock news.

the biggest question i've been getting from my friends is, ""so, are you like, going to get a penis?"" the answer is: no. i am not planning on having bottom surgery ever in my life. first and foremost, i don't feel that my genitalia dictates my gender. secondly, i don't have the 50k to spend on the operation. i don't have the 7k for top surgery which i want more than a pony right now. that's a bad analysis; i hate ponies. you get my drift.&nbsp;

i haven't been feeling angry or more aggressive. i have less of an appetite and have lost some weight as opposed to being hungry and gaining it, which is what i was told would happen. but i'm only on my second shot, three weeks into everything. i'm sure it will all happen in due time. except the aggression part; i hope that never happens. not in a negative way.

this is my life right now. i will post pictures when i can, but it's hard since they're on my laptop and this is not my laptop. this is dial up. slow, slow dial up. *sigh* leave love if the spirit moves you to do so.

oh, speaking of, the spirit moved me last night to finally write the letters to my parents. i'll post them after my parents have received them. i don't think they're works of art or anything, but i think i said what i needed to say in a respectful and loving manner, which was the goal. i was going to go with devastating and heart breaking but decided against it."

"event","I have <strong>officially<em> </em></strong>started testosterone! <br /><br />I had to go in for an in-take, even though I already have hormones, because we're doing things backward (refer back to an earlier entry). Sue, the person at Mazzoni who did my in-take, was amazing. She was funny and made me feel so comfortable. The in-take was just a few questions about my lifestyle, if I had support and talking about what some of my goals were. Simple. Then, she had to take blood again because the last sample never made it to the lab for whatever reason. Easy. <br /><br />Then she, very patiently mind you, taught me how to self-inject. Lillian went through the steps, too, because lord knows I'm going to need help remembering. <br /><br />Here's how it went, as far as I can recall:<br /><br />First, Sue drew a circle on a piece of paper. ""This is your butt, "" she said. ""It's like you've known me my whole life,"" was my reply. Next, she drew quadrants on the circle. She explained that I wanted to inject in one of the upper quadrants, making sure that I switch back and forth between injections because if you don't you can develop a callous. <br /><br />Next, we all got out our needles, swabs and band aids. I brought my testosterone with me. I'm just going to list out the steps because I think it would be easier for me to explain it. <br /><br />1. Lay out all your supplies. This would include your syringe, the other needle, alcohol swabs, band aids and the testosterone. <br /><br />2. Open the bottle of testosterone by peeling back the tabs in the center of the bottle. Take an alcohol swab and wipe down the top of the bottle. Sue said it was important to do this every time because, although the bottle is covered, dust could get on the needle. <br /><br />3. Open the syringe. Brace it against your hand so that you don't stab yourself and twist the top to the right and wiggle it off. The needle on the syringe is HUGE. <strong>HUGE. </strong>It was a little scary, I must confess. But it's okay, because that's not the needle you inject yourself with.<br /><br />4. Pull the syringe back to the dose you are taking. I'm taking a 1/2, so I pulled it back until the line matched the half mark (it's really clear). You have to fill the needle with air first because the testosterone is under pressure and you need to inject into it what you're pulling out. <br /><br />5. Stab the needle through the center of the top of the testosterone bottle. I did well with this part, believe it or not. Tip the bottle upside down and pull the syringe back until it matches the dose on the barrel that you need. <br /><br />6. There will be air in the syringe, so you have to push it back into the bottle until the air bubble disappears. I'm <strong>terrified<em> </em></strong>of injecting myself incorrectly and dying, but it's really obvious when there is air in the barrel. Really, I promise. Then you pull it back out until it's back at the dose you need. Then you tap it to make sure all the air is out.<br /><br />7. You flip the testosterone over and pull the entire needle out. Close the testosterone. <br /><br />8.&nbsp; It's time to put the smaller needle on (did I mention the other one was GIGANTIC? oh...because it is...). Open the package of the smaller needle and place the needle (still cased) on the table. Oh, you'll need a table or something. I should mention that earlier. Bite me. Cap the needle that's still on the barrel, and brace the barrel on your hand like before and twist left. The entire needle will come off the barrel, but this is a good thing. Then, take the smaller needle and twist it to the right to put it on the barrel. <br /><br />9. Brace the barrel against your hand again, as to not poke yourself, and wiggle off the cap. <br /><br />10. Drop your pants. Pull down your underwear and decide on a spot. Alcohol swab the entire area. Have a band aid opened and ready to go.<br /><br />11. Hold the barrel of the syringe almost like you're going to draw. The more fingers you use the better because that means you'll be more sturdy. Find a spot in the top area of your butt (quadrant picture). Put all your weight on the foot of the butt cheek that you are not injecting in (so you need to lean against something). <br /><br />12. Inject as straight as possible. The goal is to go into muscle, not fat, and avoid veins and things. It really didn't hurt to inject myself, and I had never injected myself with anything for any reason before. I was nervous, but it didn't hurt and it went in ""like butter,"" as Sue kept saying. Sue made it so comfortable. <br /><br />13. Once the entire needle is in, draw back the slightest bit to see if you draw any blood. This is highly unlikely, but in the event you do draw blood, it means that you've hit a vein or artery. Sue says there is very little chance of that happening, but if it does just start over. She said it was best not to put blood in muscle and cross contaminate things. Sue is smart.<br /><br />14. If no blood, inject. When all the testosterone is out of the barrel, pull the needle straight out. <br /><br />15. Often times, a little medicine will come out, but it's okay. I couldn't even see the hole until I saw a little bit of the testosterone seeping out. Lil put a band aid on my ass (which you could apply yourself b/c Lil won't be there with you and if she is...well, we're going to have words). <br /><br />16. Shake the doctor's hand with your pants down like I did. I'm so classy. It was funny. She said, ""Oh honey, guys shake my hand with their pants down all the time."" Did I mention Sue was fantastic? <br /><br />So, as far as I can remember, that's right. I'm not putting this on here as a step-by-step guide! So don't do it by these guidelines and then sue me if something goes wrong. This was just my experience, the best that I can remember it. I'm beyond thankful that I had Sue and the Mazzoni Center to go to to help me with this process. If I were getting T off the streets, I would go to a local hospital to see if there were classes to teach myself to self-inject. <br /><br />I always thought that the injections went into my thigh, but I was wrong. It's the ass. I shot myself in the ass. <br /><br />Sue then asked if Lil and I had any questions and went over what would be happening. She said to expect to see big changes within six months. She gave me several more small needles, alcohol swabs, a list of doctors that perform certain types of surgeries and their locations and some band aids. Sue is amazing.<br /><br />So, that was my first shot of testosterone. I know I'm suppose to take before pictures, but I don' t know if I can stomach them. We'll see. I should just suck it up, huh?<br /><br />My ass cheek hurts, but I'm so happy. And I'm thankful that Lillian is in my life and so, so supportive. I know my emotions are going to be wild the next few months, but I love her and&nbsp; hope that we can talk about things and work through it. <br /><br />Thank you to all my friends and family (and those that are one in the same) for the support. I love you all."

"event","I am so, so tired. For whatever reasons, I have been unable to sleep the past two nights. I haven't felt overly anxious, given the circumstances that I'm moving and starting T and all that comes with those two lovely things. I just haven't slept, which makes me feel a little, well, crazy.<br /><br />It's 7:32. My appointment is at 9. Lil is next to me, putting on make up. Oh, I remember the days when that was something I did. Make up, of course, being foundation and eyeliner. And then just eyeliner. And then there was this small period of time when I was wearing differently colored mascara. And <em>then</em> there was a time period where I was putting it in my eyebrows for some reason. My dear lord, I was never cut out for that shit. <br /><br />I digress. So, SURPRISE! My body decided to bleed just one last time. I don't care; the person doing my in-take today had better still ""let me"" start T. No more making me wait, Mazzoni. It's time, and I feel like anymore stumbling blocks and I'll be heading to the clock-tower. I feel like I need to say that I'm just kidding, less someone should read into that an actual threat and take legal action. Damn this police state that we're living in. <br /><br />I guess this is it, pending I don't make it there or they refuse to show me how to self inject. I would be much more enthusiastic if I were more awake. I promise. I think I'm just ready to a point where ""excited"" isn't an option anymore. <br /><br />It's like the ""clink, clink, clink"" of a roller coaster while you're heading up the first and biggest drop, only it has been like that's happening for two years. You can only anticipate it so much until you just sort of snap at the precipice of the drop. Another good metaphor is that I orgasmed without really <em>knowing</em> I did. I mean, it's almost a let down except that you still <em>orgasmed</em>...so, you know, why bitch?<br /><br />Okay. New rule. <strong>No more journaling before noon</strong>. I'm glad we're all agreed about that. I'll recap how the visit went when I get back."

"event","Well, hot damn. It's been a while, hasn't it? I had to go to New York for a fun little event called CyZyGy for my work. It was on Columbia's campus, which we were not allowed to leave. Huzzah for being in the cultural center of North America and getting to see nothing. But, I digress. I just wanted to explain why I haven't been updating much. That, and I just ""graduated"" to unemployment from the program I was in, so I've been a little busy.<br /><br />My dad knows, but not from a letter that I wrote. I'm not exactly sure <em>what</em> he knows, but my sister ended up telling him bits and pieces. It really wasn't her fault, and had I been in the same situation, I probably would have done the same thing, so there are no hard feelings between my sister and I. It was a difficult situation for her to be in, and I acknowledge that. Here's how it went down: My sister was home in Indiana for Father's Day. My dad told her there was a movie coming on Lifetime that he wanted to record for me. I don't know if anyone caught it, but it was the Gwen Araujo story (<a href=""http://www.lifetimetv.com/movies/originals/agirllikeme.php"">http://www.lifetimetv.com/movies/originals/agirllikeme.php</a>). So, it had this transgender theme, obviously. My sister thought that was really interesting and asked if my father had received a letter from me. He said that no, he had not received a letter and then began asking questions *galore* about what would be in the letter. So, my sister told him that I had made some decisions about my gender situation and I was going to write him and tell him about it. She said I was going to start taking ""medicine."" Which, in a way, I suppose is true.&nbsp;<br /><br />He asked some questions, and then he asked, ""How is she paying for this?"" My sister was quick to say that he wouldn't have to pay for anything, and then he said, ""That wasn't what I meant at all."" So, once again, my father's main concern is my safety and happiness. Thank god. To be honest, my main concern isn't/wasn't that he'd disown me; my father has been consistent and unwavering in his support for me as his child. But, I mean, this changes things. This changes everything. Whether I want it to or not, whether it should or not, it does change things. His main concern was how my mother was going to react. He wanted my sister to be there when my mom gets the letter, which I think is a pretty good idea. I'm going to see what I can do to coordinate that situation.<br /><br />I received my testosterone in the mail the day before I left for New York. It was exciting and disappointing all at the same time because I had it and I couldn't do anything with it. I have to wait until I have my in-take at Mazzoni, and they also have to redraw my blood because the sample was ""too old"" or something when they sent it away to the lab. At my in-take, I'll be taught how to self-inject so I don' t harm myself. They think of everything there. So, as far as I know, my official ""T-Day"" is Thursday, June 29th. Yes, I am excited. Yes, I am nervous. Yes, I am ready.&nbsp;<br /><br />

"event","the appointment went really well. as the theme with me seems to be, we had to do things a little backward. normally, when a person comes to mazzoni and says that they want hormones, they make an appointment for an in-take. an in-take is an assessment where they go over what you want, why and the positive and negative results that will or could happen. i skipped this step because i didn't know to specify this, my therapist didn't know and the receptionist didn't ask what my appointment was for.&nbsp; 

i went in, filled out some paperwork and then i was measured and weighed. here's the thing about that: unless i've shrunk, their measurement of my height was off. they said i'm 5'4"", but i have been at least 5'5"" or 5'5 1/2"" every other time i was measured. and i weighed around 137, although i think that's not exactly right, either. i'd say i'm between 134-137. but it's three pounds, i'm not going to split hairs.&nbsp; 

dr. winn sat down and talked to me about what i wanted and why. he asked me to tell him what i knew about testosterone and what it could or will do to my body and my emotional state. so, i relayed all the information i had about it and he said that i was right and it sounded like i had done my homework. i told him i wanted hormones before i moved and he said it wasn't a problem.&nbsp;then they drew my blood to test my hormone levels and make certain that everything is normal before i start injecting myself with anything. it didn't hurt. 

here's how getting t from mazzoni works. dr. winn called a place in oregon and arranged for me to have three prescriptions. this means that when i run out, i can call the pharmacy in oregon to refill twice, which is phenomenal news because it gives me plenty of time to arrange something else in asheville. he told me to call the pharmacy the next day, give them my name and birthday and they'd be able to send me the t in the mail. so, i called. the person who answered the phone was extraordinarily nice. the t costs $50, and that is because mazzoni has an arrangement with the pharmacy. dr. winn said that the hormones would be $150 at a local pharmacy.&nbsp;also, i&nbsp;am not using my insurance at all, so there is no record what-so-ever of me using testosterone, and i have not officially been diagnosed with GID. mazzoni would write a letter upon my request if i needed it for surgery.&nbsp; 

anyway, the pharmacy is sending the hormones in the mail and i should get them on tuesday. i can't take them yet for several reasons. first, i have to have my in-take at the mazzoni center. i can't make an appointment because of the second reason i can't begin hormones yet; i'm going to new york for five days for work. thirdly, i have to learn how to self inject so i don't hurt or kill myself. fair enough. 

the pharmacy that's sending me the t is also sending me syringes, which is nice. i'm gong to have a 20 week supply, but i'm probably going to begin with a half dose for a while in order to ease my body into things which means it will last a lot longer.&nbsp; 

my anxiety has been out of control this past week. i haven't been able to sleep, and when i do i wake up constantly in a panic. parts of my body have been going numb, i've had headaches and i've been breaking down and crying (although i do this mostly when no one is around, so at least i can still control it for the most part). i'm terrified of telling my parents. i'm still working on their letters, but i'm not sure how far i'm going to be able to get on them since i'm leaving for new york. i hate that i have to go at this juncture in my life; i feel like i'm at the precipice of such an amazing and long awaited new beginning. hopefully new york will be a distraction from the anxiety here, but i have a feeling it may compound things to be away from the only support i have right now.&nbsp; 

i'm glad i waited as long as i did to pursue hormone treatment. i'm glad i'm doing things the legal way, too. i understand that there are some people that cannot afford to go through the proper channels, so i'm not judging anyone's way of doing things. what i do know is that this process, going on 3/4 years now, has been well worth it. although i began therapy only a month and a half ago, my journey began so much further back than that. everything i chose to do, i chose to do on my time. i have no regrets.&nbsp; 

i'm still worried about finding a job in asheville and about relocating and essentially starting over again, but i'm looking forward to growing, changing, exploring, learning and loving in new ways, in new realms and, as always, with all my heart. i'm in love. i have support. and, albeit dysfunctionally fun, i have family. i realize how blessed i am, and i'm grateful."

"event","dear parents,<br /><br /><strike>i am writing to tell you that i'm a boy.<br /></strike><br />shit.<br /><br /><strike>i have herpes. just kidding, but i am trans....<br /></strike><br />fuck.<br /><br /><strike>i thought i <em>had </em>told you. isn't ""lesbian"" french for ""gender disphoria?""<br /></strike><br />this process is not going well. my therapist wanted me to have the letter home written by the&nbsp;next time i see him,&nbsp;which is friday. i've tried so many times to sit down and write out a big, lengthy and scary explanation and it just doesn't work. i have the day off tomorrow (which is today), so i'm hoping to maybe walk to r. square and try to write something. it's not like i'm afraid of being disowned or something; quite frankly, it's a little late for that. my parents help me out now and then financially, but i wouldn't say i rely on them, so that isn't a concern.&nbsp;<br /><br />i'm afraid of fucking up relationships that it took so long to build and rebuild. my father and i never had much of a relationship growing up, and now we do. i got to know him as a person, really, before i got to know him as a father. and i'm so completely happy with the role of ""dad"" and ""friend"" that he's played. i really think he understands me (obviously, to a point) and all he's ever told me was that he wanted me to be happy. i should have got that in writing, huh? then he would be contractually obligated not to be upset.<br /><br />and then there's my mother. my mother loves me. i know my mother loves me. she does not understand me. and we could replace ""understand"" with a variety of words. lets list them, shall we?&nbsp;<br />such substitutions could include but are not limited to:<br /><br />know<br />like<br />accept<br />validate<br /><br />i count myself lucky to have a mother that&nbsp;i can call and ask questions about migraines or mysterious skin irritations. she'll talk to me, demand i get more sleep and ask if i'm eating rigt. she doesn't know that i worked so hard to get a gsa at my school and then no students showed up. she has no clue that in college i lead a student organization and received a standing ovation for a poem i read. she has no idea the nights i've laid awake thinking about the pain that i've caused her just by being who i am.&nbsp;<br /><br />she has no idea that i still stare at the ceiling, night after night, wishing i didn't have to tell her anything. but i do. because this can't be explained away by silence or excuses. i've been binding for well over 2 years and she still just thinks i went from a c cup to flat because i lost some weight in college. it's amazing the things we can convince ourselves of if we just try hard enough.&nbsp;<br /><br />i called and officially made my appointment for my physical on wednesday with mazzoni. i'm not sure when i'll be able to start hormones, but it will be before i leave for asheville.&nbsp;<br /><br />i'm 23 today.&nbsp;<br /><br />god. i let the cursor blink about a thousand times after i wrote that. it's weird to be here. here is so many places right now.&nbsp;<br /><br />can you hear the dramatic music playing in the background? i would like to think so. i would like to think it's a mix of law and order: svu, the simpsons and punky brewster. the ""doink doinks"" from svu would really add a lot.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","This is information from a pamphlet given to me from the Mazzoni Center in case anyone is interested in their policies and standards. They truly are paving the way for trans health care. <br /><br /><strong>What kinds of trans people come to Mazzoni Center?<br /></strong>Our clients include female-to-male and male-to-female transsexuals, genderqueer people, queens, trannyfags, and people who don't feel that any label fits them. Our clients come from many different cultural backgrounds and all walks of life. Some come looking for hormones and genital surgery, some feel they are comfortable without either. Our trans health program focuses on helping patients determine their own transition and identity goals.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Can I get hormone at Mazzoni Center?<br /></strong>Yes. You must be over 18, or legally emancipated, or have consent from a parent or guardian. We provide prescriptions for hormones as well as blood tests to make sure your levels are appropriate.<br /><br /><strong>Can I get surgery at Mazzoni Center?<br /></strong>No. Mazzoni Center is a primary care health center and can not provide transgender surgery, but we can help with aftercare for surgeries performed elsewhere. If you are seeking gender-related surgery, our staff can help you find a surgeon.<br /><br /><strong>Do I need a letter from a therapist to get hormones or other trans services?<br /></strong>No. We do not require clients to be in therapy. We do offer therapy through our Open Door program, but if you feel you don't need therapy, that's fine.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Can I get a letter for a surgeon?<br /></strong>Our clinicians can write letters for clients, which you could use to satisfy the Harry Benjamin requirements with an outside surgeon.<br /><br /><strong>If I'm HIV+, can I still get hormones and other services at Mazzoni Center?<br /></strong>Yes, absolutely. We provide trans-specific health services to HIV+ people, and also offer primary care and case management specifically for people with HIV disease.<br /><br /><strong>If I have a mental health diagnosis, can I still come to Mazzoni Center?<br /></strong>Yes. We even offer mental health services through our Open Door program.<br /><br /><strong>Will the trans program give me a mental health diagnosis because of my gender?<br /></strong>No. Because many insurance companies and mental health programs will exclude patients with Gender Identity Disorder, we generally use other diagnoses, such as Endocrine Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified. However, many surgeons and other professionals require a GID diagnosis. Therefore, if you request it, we can diagnose you with GID (if appropriate!)<br /><br /><strong>How much will this cost?<br /></strong>Mazzoni Center now accepts most insurance plans. We also offer services on a sliding scale. This means we determine the cost based on your income and how many people live off that money. You will not be turned away for lack of money-we will see you first and worry about payment later.<br /><br /><strong>Can I use my Medical Assistance at the Mazzoni Center?<br /></strong>Mazzoni Center now does accept Medical Assistance for payment, or you may choose to use our sliding scale.<br /><br /><strong>Does Mazzoni Center follow the Harry Benjamin Guidelines?<br /></strong>No. We recognize that the Benjamin Standards are a respected and influential set of guidelines for providing health care to trans people. However, our clinic uses a client centered approach based on your informed consent to treatment. We do not set requirements for your gender identity or history.<br /><br /><strong>How can I get more information?<br /></strong>To make an appointment, call the appointment line at 215.563.0658. If you have specific questions about the Trans Health Program, contact Susan Collins, LGBT Health Specialists, at 215.563.0658 ext. 277. or email <a href=""mailto:scollins@mazzonicenter.org"">scollins@mazzonicenter.org</a>. More general questions can be addressed to info@mazzonicenter.org<br /><br /><br />"

"event","i have made an account at transter.com to look at pictures of recent surgeries. lillian and i spent the better part of our sunday morning/afternoon looking at top and bottom surgeries. wow, kids. they look fun. i'm sure i'll ask for another when i'm done with the first. *vomit* i'm glad i'm not getting bottom surgery in any form. top looks fun enough.

i'm worried that lil isn't telling me everything she's feeling, but i think i'm just going to have that fear for a while. like forever. i wrote a friend&nbsp;to ask some questions about what to expect when i begin testosterone. it's hard to read some of the answers because i'm afraid. the last thing i want is to mess up the relationships i have. but he said something very true.&nbsp;i asked if he felt like testosterone changed his core person. he said no, but that he isn't the person he was when he started t two years ago, not because of the t, but because people change. i think i'm so used to stifling my growth that i don't let myself change. or, when i do change, i feel this tremendous amount of guilt for it.&nbsp;

sometimes banana republic jeans look good on me. yes. they're from a thrift store, but is that selling out? you see the dilemma.&nbsp;

lillian just read this and said it isn't trans related. but it is, friends.&nbsp;

i'm afraid. that's the bottom line. i'm afraid of how i will change, how my relationships will change and who i'll be. and there's no way to know the answers to these questions until after the fact.&nbsp;

so, now we play the waiting game coupled with the therapy game.&nbsp;

i am excited about my physical and to know my start date for testosterone. i'm still writing letters to my parents which i'll post after they receive them."

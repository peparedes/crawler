"event","All my friends fucking suck! Im leaving in 2 weeks and no one even called to say hi or just wish me luck, I don't wanna hang out with anyone, it would just be nice to have someone that supposably is my friend to call me up and say hello. But you know what I realized I have one good friend, that against all odds has been there for me no matter what. And that friend is someone I never thought I would talk to again, but knew I was leaving and had the common decency to not wanna go out like that. And every day we make up for lost time. And I honestly don't need anybody else, and I am being so damn truthful. I don't need Matt, or any other person. Because the one person who cares enough to see me/ talk to me everyday is better then any other friend I could ever have. I need him, more then anyone else. So for all you who never bothered to call me when I was sad, or upset, or mad, or even now when you know I'm never gonna see you again, and when I wanted to hang out with you, you made me feel like you had no time in the world for me -- I think you really fucked up. So in conclusion to this entry, this is also the end of my journal.... I'm done. I know I could do the dramatic conclusion to this and go out with a bang and tell everyone that fucked me over to go grow a dick and fuck themselves, but that would be downright mean. So all I'm gonna say is just that it sucks..... and someday I hope people learn to be a little more unselfish and to care about other people or learn to expand who they care about a lil more, because you really do miss out to meet great people who eventually become friends. So don't worry I won't call you .....

P.S  -- I will keep my journal up for any comments from anybody because I love hate mail, and bullshit excuses as well .... have a nice day!"

So I finally got my community service papers in - I have to do 4 days 8 hours a day. I guess I shouldn't complain since it's only 4 days but it said bring work gloves? I'm scared, most of you know me and should know I have a strong dislike against physical labor and gettin dirty. Typical girl I guess? Not only that but I have to go to classes every wednesday from 6-10 at night! Yeah I was pretty pissed off, but I guess as far as community service goes - It's not as bad as it could be. Well im out ...."

"event","Yes well everyone Matt and I unofficially broke up. I say unofficial because the bitch never had time to tell me, he was to busy fuckin his friends Josh and Jay. Yes that's right, Matt is gay. I'm convinced and I have no doubts on this theory, it makes perfect sense. Matt is a shy boy who finally got a girlfriend (me!) And didn't understand how to have one, he was just clueless. So when he got his two tutors (his old butt buddies) Rob and Mike. They taught him the RIGHT way to have a girl. But, after I broke up with him he figured they were teaching him the wrong way. So who does he turn to? Josh and John. Perfect male specimens you think? NOPE! Sure they are cute, and look like they would treat you right. But if you get to know them as much as I did, ya'll see the homoness that I finally seen. Take Josh - Cute, Nice body and has an opinion on everything, is physically incapable of keeping his mouth shut (probably because he's to busy using it on Matt) He has this girlfriend who he has been going out with for a few years. And cheats on her non stop, with every little 14 year old he can corrupt. Now, he thinks he's the man because his girlfriend will never find out. WRONG! In reality his girlfriend is doing the same thing only with the opposite sex and doing it much better and the only reason she is staying with him, is because lets face it ladies? It's fun having a gay friend, and I do always see them shopping together -- I'm sure he has superb taste in clothes. But enough of that lets move on to John. John, well he's definitely cute but he does dress really well, and talks with his hands, and says things like super and gorgeous. Ok I'm just gonna call him out - RAGING CLOSET CASE! So ... After Matt starts becoming close with the ""down on their knees duo"" who teaches him how girls are bitches, and to avoid their phone calls, and just be a 100% grade A asshole to them, he realizes he wants to be gay along with his new CLOSE best friends. So in the end -- I'm bitter but definitely moving along since now I know that he's gay, I didn't cause this break up. So hopefully he will feel just as shitty as I did or maybe worse (wait a minute, I forgot he doesn't like girls) So boys and girls Matt is nothing but a little raging homosexual who wasted the last 6 months realizing he dated a (gasp) girl.... Oh well I wish him and two other hypersensitive, overbearing, Gap wearing, to good for girls, obnoxious, loud, and loser friends have a wonderful life together filled with boys, rainbows and pixie dust!"

And I couldn't have picked two better people to go with - Alycia and Eric - ya'll are crazy! I LOVE IT! So we ended up going to the boardwalk, beach, crabbing at 12:00 at night(that was definitely the best) and being fucked up ALMOST every night. Their was SoOoOoO much more I can go on about right now.... But I'm pissed. As of this morning I'm pretty sure I'm not with Matt anymore. Whatever I'm off it! If he'd rather listen and be with his friends every god damn fucken second of the day then whatever! I hope he turns out to be fuckin gay I really do.... I hate every fuckin person that did me dirty up to this point who fucked me over and dissed me so Rosie and Matt you're on the that list right now so FUCK BOTH OF YOU! Matt I hope you become gay with you're dumb ASSHOLE friends with no lives and Rosie I hope you and you're stupid boyfriend live unhappily ever after in a trailor park with 10 kids! UGH I'm cuttin people off - it's sad that I have to be this pissed at 2 people I cared about the most especially when I'm leaving in 28 days??? but oh well I'm through caring about people who don't give a damn about me - That is all....

"event","Wow I have a really bad past with all of my ex boyfriends. For instance if you say an ex boyfriends name to me and bring it up I get this weird disgusted look on my face and start dishing out negative comments. I guess that makes me immature. But ex boyfriends suck! I don't know why I brought that up... Oh nvm yes I do. I ran into Geoff the other day. And right when I saw him I got that eww look on my face and was repeating in my head over and over asshole, asshole, asshole! Why you might ask? I'm not quite sure, The kid really didn't do anything to me. I completely understood the whole work/relationship thing he was talking about. So I'm pretty unsure of why I got the look on my face? So anyway, I started talking to him and he was really nice so I guess everything is squashed I never knew why we stopped talking anyway.... Seriously, one day we were cuddling on his couch the next day we hated each other. So I'm not sure what happend? But it was probably my fault. It always is, I'm incapable of a relationship, I don't know how me and Matt are still talking? So anyway back to the Geoff situation, I told him I would stop by and see him before I left and he told me when he was working and all that good stuff. So Rosie and I were gettin into my car, and she was like ""oh so thats Geoff, he's cute"". Which kinda suprised me, cuz I never thought he was all that cute (just not my type cute, I guess) Did you ever realize, when someone likes you or you used to date someone and your friend or someone you know says he is cute -- You realize just by her saying that he is that much cuter? Anyway Rosie just called and I'm about to go over her house... I had more to say but I'll update later!"

I ended up going to the mall afterward cuz my dad made me angry and when I get mad I shop, I bought two pairs of shoes and the Ashlee Simpson CD. I know I'm a dork, but It's actually pretty good, and she sings her own songs which is a plus. She sounds like a lil Gwen Stafani. I went out with Steph last night, It was so much fun catching up and I know we'll end up hanging out alot before I leave. I got so mad at Matt last night. Ok I know most of you probably think I'm a bitch of a girlfriend because I always get mad at him but he really deserved it last night. Every time he is with his friends and I call him he's so ignorant to me. I don't get it? So I asked him if his friends just didn't like me anymore and he said they did like me (I guess it was just my paranoia) . But he did however admitt he was a dick to me and apologized cuz he was having a bad day. At least he knew he was wrong HaHa! So today I have no plans I'm about to call Rose Bud before she goes to work to see if she wants to have a movie night tonight, we were suppose to have it last night but I had to wake up at 7:00 this morning. Oh well! I'm so incredibly tired right now, I think I might take a nap now.... Goodnight!"

First off, it's fourth of July tomorrow their is not only going to be the usual holiday traffic, but the Phillies are playing, Penns Landin ships and the Madonna concert, and their is a BIG HUGE chance my car may not even make it there. Every time I stop at a light, or a stop sign and press on the gas it makes a weird popping sound under the left tire. So hopefully it doesn't break down, it sounds like it might backfire, hopefully if thats the case it will do that and be okay.

If you don't wanna chill just tell me that, don't fuck around with me and diss me at the last minute when I could've chilled wit someone else. God, I hate people. Anyway I ended up going to a kegger for twelves party last night, it was real chill and I was having fun wit all my girls. But of course drama always has to go down, and two boys got in a fight and the neighbors called the cops for a noise disturbance. So the police came just to tell us to chill out and like dumbasses we all hid instead. Well we all got caught and had to go to the station. They found weed in the bathroom and threatened to take up to county untill someone fessed up to it. Well of course no one wanted to, so 5 minutes before we were almost locked the fuck up some dude I don't even know said it was his.I didn't get home till 5:30 in the morning. Ugh I give up...

So I show up with Rosie and I soon as I get there my mom starts feeding us beers, she was of course flagged as was the rest of my family. So by the end of the night I was feeling pretty well and started dancing, and you wouldn't imagine how many dirty looks I got from my own family. It was pretty amusing, since first of all I never see them and second of all they are so jealous even my own aunt told me she doesn't even want to see me because every time she does I act like I'm so much better then everyone. But obviously I don't give a shit what everyone says or thinks about me, so I continue to have a good time by myself, since Rosie was tired. Oh well at the end of the night I hooked up with my cousins friend and she got pissed off. Oh well! Rob was there and even though it was nice seeing him, even though he was wit his girl I still give him attitude cuz he's fucked up for what he did to me! 
Saturday night I ended calling up Kristy who I missed and haven't seen her in so long. We actually ended up goin down to the beach to her ex-boyfriends boys house. It was a nice time got a little intoxicated but it was a good time, even though Kristy got all mad at me, her friends boyfriend got locked up and I had a huge headache. But the one thing that pissed me off was her boyfriends friend was really nice and we were flirting all night and the girl that we were with fooled around with him that night. She stole my pimp juice! Its cool though but I was just mad because he told me I was the kinda girl he wants to take home to his mom, like a wifey type of girl. And thats why guys don't mess around with me, and they would rather pick the easy girl instead of me. Whatever. I'd rather be a wifey then a ho -- not that I'm calling that girl a ho I just wouldn't do that I guess?
Anyway we went to the Italian Fez Monday night, I had a good time, other then the fact I spent an hour doing my hair only for it to pour once we got there. But I had fun making fun of the drunk old people and flirting with the hot police men. I actually met some guy that is friends with Kristy and he got my number and I'm probably gonna chill with him if I'm around the way tomorrow. I also got to see my old Wilmington friends. So it was a pretty nice weekend. 
I think Rosie is mad at my though, I think she is pissed becuase Friday at my cousins party I wasn't paying attention to her and she didn't know anyone. But I tried to get her to dance and talk to everyone with me, but she was complaining she was tired and kept walking away and talkin on her cell phone the whole time, so what was I suppose to do? Oh well I'm about to pass out cuz I had work all day today and I'm tired as a mother fucker... Oh yeah Alycia call me when you feel like chilling becuase everytime I call you -- you're always busy girl... So when YOU are not hit ME up~"

I'm going to stop being such a good friend to people, I only get shit on in the end. I make up excuses for them to myself to make me feel better, so I don't feel so rejected all the time. It's alright though, I wouldn't even want to be my friend sometimes. I was thinking about calling Rob or Mike to tell them I still wanted to talk to them even though I broke up with Matt and if that means I'd lose them then it would really break my heart. I guess I probably should call them, but I have this thing called pride and think to myself if they really wanted to talk to me, then they would've called me by now. They are all mad probably because I broke up with him. They think I have it easy now... Why? Just because I broke up with him doesn't mean I'm not hurting as much or more then he is right now. I'm sure he's having fun with all his friends right now.... heh friends -- what are they?

I'm bored, and I can't wait till tonight, cuz Alycia is having a party and I wanna drink really bad since I haven't drank in so long and i'm not on boyfriend duty tonight so I get to chill with my friends for once and just hang out. I know I may sound really cliche, but I really hate girls. They piss me off and they are really bitchy and fake. I'm waiting to meet a girl who will just sit down with a bunch of guys and drink beer in sweatpants and eat a taco and talk about a baseball game. Thats the girl I wanna be friends with. Last night we went to dinner with these girls and they just sat there and ordered water and didn't eat anything and just whispered to each other the whole time, who does that? It just really pissed me off. Oh well I'm gonna go on ebay I'm currently the highest bidder for the cell phone i've been wanting forever, I know I'm a nerd - Peace everybody - i'm off to get drunk tonight!"

"event","So more drama of course. I can't seem to escape it, it follows me around. I ended up telling Matt about the ""other guy"" which in my opinion wasn't that big of a deal? First off me and MAtt are only hooking up and that means we can get with other people, but when I told him about it he thought we were more then that and got all mad at me and what not? But if he would open his mouth once and a while and talk to me more, then I would have known what was going on and wouldn't have done it. In a way though, I'm glad I told him I realized all his friends who were supposably ""my boys"" are nothing but liars, shit talkers and assholes. One of the reasons I wanted to stay with Matt (even though this sounds bad) was because I would be devestated if I couldn't see his friends anymore because they are all awesome people (so I thought) Untill Rob told everyone about the whole situation and everyone started gettin into my business, what a bunch of pricks - whatever, now I know better then to trust stupid boys! Anyway I only have 2 months untill I leave and I wanna go out and have fun with my friends and hook up with whoever I want to. So since me and Matt talked about it (well fought about it for the last few days) I thought we were cool last night and he hasn't called me or anything today so I guess thats it? But like I said before I only have 2 months and I'm not gonna spend them thinkin about what went wrong, and whose fought it was and why that my supposid friends talk shit. Me and Alycia saw the REAL WORLD HOUSE (thanks Steph) now we are thinking of a plot to stalk them and be on the show (we'll actually that was more me then her) I'm off to get ready to visit my girlie Rosie so we can go out soon - so peace 
P.S -- Alycia I called you today - you weineyhead to tell you what happend but no answer - so call me later if you read this before you check your messages!!!! GOTTA GET READY!!!!
R.I.P  lil Racoon I killed last night - I'm sorry Alycia!!!!"

But now it's hard, cuz both these guys are really nice and sweet. Hmm... I dont hurt people so I really have to make a big decision between the guy I feel comfortable around and is a tad shy or the one who is a gentlemen and is more outgoing. Hmm?? I don't know, i'm talking to Rosie we are making plans for this weekend Saturday night we are making cocktails (magaritas, cosmopolatians, and wine) and then Sunday we are going to the beach.

"event","So last night was suppose to be fun, Rosie me and her man were all suppose to get a hotel room and drink and be stupid. But of course her and her boyfriend got in another fight. It was all dumb, really. Me and Rosie walked into the gas station and these guys told us we were beautiful while her boyfriend was in the car, and we went in to get ciggerates but supposably we took to long because her boyfriend was all mad and jealous and said we were probably in their flirting with everyone and gettin their numbers... which in fact was not the case even though the guy asked us if we were strippers??? Um I was in a tank top and sweatpants, maybe if I came in, in couchie cutters and lil shirt then I could see his point but whatever ... guys are dumb. So they argued for like an hour about taking to long in the gas station, and then me and Rosie left to eat and when we got back he was sittin at her house. He's a weird dude, I'm telling you.  So then they argued their for like an hour while I was in the other room talking to Matt. Finally, we decided to just get a room and drink -- this all could have been avoided and we could have done this at 11 instead of 3 am. But hey, her boyfriend is retarted what can I say ? So we ended up drinkin one screw driver and passing out cuz they were tired and I was tired of listening to them argue! 
Ugh why are ex boyfriends (hook ups whatever) sooo stupid? It's like they only want you back when your not single anymore. And when you were fighting with him, you want them to say something to make it better but they dont and then they call you 3 months later and start telling you everything you wanted to hear just a lil too late, and then you question everything you have with your new man to think that your old man actually changed and then you give up your new man for the old one and he's still the same old asshole he was before. So this time I'm just gonna stay where I'm at, cuz I kinda like this one and I don't wanna do anything stupid -- but should I tell him about the ex or not? Any suggestions??? So whatever you do AVOID THIS FATE don't go back with the ex no matter how hot he is, underneath he's just as immature, stupid and ignorant as he was before he'll just try to cover it up for a few months first ..... Anyway I have to go get my mommy a mothers day present cuz I'm a last minute shopper and thats the bottom line .... haha"

I was so excited, I was prancing around the carnival yelling I gotta britney poster I got a britney poster - it was kinda like the hershey's guy I got some chocolate I got some chocolate only it was the britney poster! and no i'm not drunk just in a silly mood. Then I called Matty, cuz he called me the other day and I still didn't call him back and he told me he was coming up this weekend, and we are all gonna hang out! YESSA! It's been so long since I hung out with Matty since he moved to Virginia, Drunkin Glo Bowling! Today I finally got my pink phillies hat! I wanted it for so long. Did anybody see the Real World previews for next week? (yeah I have no life and stay in to watch it?) Yo that girl Frankie is a bitch. I seriously want someone to punch her in the face and tell her to cry about that, freak ass bitch! I hope her and that girl Veronica from the Inferno get in a fight with each other and both fall down dead - that would be entertainment! MTV should be taking notes if they are smart!

"event","Hmmm wow I updated two days in a row - HOLLA for me! My night last night was kinda bummy. We didn't really go out - except for our lil walk around the block. But we did have a good time sitting outside making fun of people for CHUCKing example - Some boy came up to ask me for a ciggerate, so I gave him one because he was kinda cute. So we just started talking for a lil bit and he walked away - with me candidly (HAHA ALYCIA) saying wow he was cute and then me backing it up while he was gettin in the car saying how nice his ass was! (i'm a butt girl! what can I say) So he shouted out the car ""whats up baby"" (definitely flirting with me)and then he sat in the car for the next 10 minutes just sitting there and it was kinda buggin me out, so I was like what the hell is he doing ? and Cheryl was like he's probably waitin for a friend and I was like or a girlfriend - so not even 20 seconds after I said that 2 girls come out and one sits in the back with him and we start cracking up, and he turned to me and did the little ""cut it"" signal to shut me up. Then we they pull away he had the decency to wave goodbye to me - aww isn't that sweet the ugly lil shit! Guys are dogs! But whatever it was all good we had a good laugh about it, even though writing it now and someone probably reading it doesn't think it's funny -- it really was so whatev! Anyway after that whole fiasco - we went to pick a movie, but our choices were limited so I picked I know what you did last summer - and Krista says no lets what the Last Unicorn ! Well there was no way I was fucken watching that movie, but Krista being the anal retart she is put it in, so I spent the whole time talkin to Matt and bitching about the fuckin stupid ass movie! Ugh it gave me a migraine! So this morning we walk the hike an a half to the garage to get my car and go back to Alycia's dorm so we could get our shit, well I put my hazard lights on for not more then 5 minutes and I got back in and my car wouldn't start. I was so mad, we had to call public safety and get it jumped. So after that I thought it would be a good idea to go to Pep boys and get a new battery to delay the inevitable of my car one day killing me (oh cuz my car hates me!) So we go there and wait for an hour to get it fixed and watch these gross old guys hit on us and blow us kisses which was quite repolsive. So that brings me to right now where I'm waitin for Alycias dirty butt to get outta the shower - and figure out what/if we are doing anything tonight, cuz if not Ill probably just help Matt babysit and then go to bed - cuz i'm boring, but I really wanna get trashed tonight - hopefully Alycia will go for that - haha we can beg - anyway i'm out so peace!"

I'm waiting for Rosie to come and drop of my shit since I left it in her car, and i'm incredibly bored and really tired. I think I had like 6 hours of sleep in the last 4 days. 28 days till I never have to work at Gadzooks again, how exciting? I can't wait! I just want it to be over, I hate working endless hours and only having off 1 day a week. It was fun while it lasted but I'm ready to get out now, I hate it there. Besides, I handed in all of my college stuff, and I'm gettin really excited about it. I got the hall I wanted and a scholorship for woman in communications. So I just want leave now, and get the good-byes over with. It's gonna be sad, especially now since my parents may not even be going, BUT I still can't wait I'm going to be in a totally different state, not knowing a single person and gettin to start over.... It's gonna be fun. 
  I really think I'm going to join the convent though, I really don't like guys, and I don't think I have it in me to become a lesbian.... SO to be a nun is the only thing I could possibly do, except I don't really believe in that whole religous God thing which COULD be a slight problem since I'll be living in a church or right next to one (or whatever goes on there) I just don't think I can handle being with a guy for more than 3 weeks, is that weird? I really like a guy at first and then all of a sudden they'll do or say something weird and I'll get completely turned off for the stupidest reasons and then i'll keep thinking about that thing for weeks untill finally I can't even look at them anymore and I just stop talking to them all together. I dunno whats wrong with me? I'm not scared of being hurt cuz everyone knows I'm physically incapable of crying over a guy  (I dunno I don't think i've done that since 9th grade? It just seems stupid) And I don't have a problem with jealousy and all that stupid relationship drama. Hmmm whatever no time to think about it I gots betta things to do!

   But anyway, my store is closing forever which means I am currently unemployed in March. And to top it off my mommy got laid off, so we are both pretty miserable considering what's going on. I'm trying to scrape off money to pay of my car, which is the worst peice of shit I've ever seen in my life. The outside it's nice and it looks like a good car the inside is just falling apart. My service engine light is permenatly on, my break light goes on when I hit the gas, it stalls everyday (mostly twice) the break and anti lock break light is on, oh yeah and I have to climb over the passenger side to drive the frigen car becuase the driver side door is permenatly shut closed! So i'm working my ass off to pay off that, and to top it off my manager just up and decided to not come to work um... EVER AGAIN. So me and Tyrell are working 6 days a week and 2 of the days we work 13 hours. So I never have a day off and the 1 day a week I do have off I am sleeping b/c I am so exhausted! I never go out on weekends, and I if i'm not working I am sleeping indefinetly. 
   Which comes to my next lil story... The only good thing about going to work is seeing my crush every day. He is absolutely gorgeous! I've loved him for like a year, well I just found out the other day the he is leaving me. The only good thing about that was he gave me a big kiss and a hug and promised he'd call me his last day. I won't hold my breath BUT he did give me that kiss and that's all I needed, besides like i've been saying before he is way to good for me. However, I did meet a really cute guy today he wasn't as good as my lil crush BUT he was really hot, so it all works out I guess?
      Well I'm tired AS ALWAYS and I actually have off tomorrow so i'm going to bed and sleeping till dinner time!"

Rosie, her man, Ashley and myself all go up to the clubby club to shake out tailfeathers but before we went we hit up south street and drank. I think I lost my good ol lush self, I could barely drink the captain (he used to be like my best friend) I just couldn't do it without feelin like I was gonna get sick. I dunno I'm just not the same alcoholic Heather everyone seems to know and love. But I drank enough to get a lil buzz, but before I even stepped outta the club I was sober again. But it was all good, cuz I was definiely in a clubbin mood and I tried to tear up the dance floor with Ashley as best as I could without makin the other girls TOO jealous, hehe. Why is it whenever I go to Chrome I always get hit on short rat lookin mexican dudes? It's crazy! But it's whatever. But I did have a fun time,  although I had a funny experience after the club (it's too funny to write about! HA) Anyway Saturday I didn't do anything I had work on Sunday and I just wanted to sleep. Yesterday was kinda funny though, Rob called me up after not talkin to him for a few months since he definitely dicked me over and hurt my feelings and made me feel sad. Well he called me to see if he could come over, so I was like um yeah? So he showed up with his cute friend and we were just chillin and me and Rob started fightin as usual. Well he had a ring on with his girls name on it so I called it a blunged out peice of shit and he got all salty and locked us out of his friends car. Well I decided to have a little fun and piss him off so I started huggin on his friend and flirtin with him and Rob was like whatever do whatever the fuck you want to? Eww dude whatever this kid was a prick to me so I did I told his friend to come in my car since it was so cold and hooked up with him. HA!!!!!! I don't know if I did it to piss him off or because his friend was so cute, but it was all good. So that night Rob calls me saying he was bitter and talking about how his girlfriend was annoying him and he doesn't understand anything anymore blah blah blah cry me a fuckin river. But i'm glad he wasn't really mad at me, cuz it was nice seeing him even if he did piss me off really bad. So today I worked again as usual, I'm sick of it there seriously, No matter what I do I always seem to get in trouble for it even if i'm helping and it's always by Tyrell who doesn't even have the right to yell at me and the only people that do all love me. The Distric Manager bought me a birthday present today, It was so nice. Anyway I just can not stand him anymore! UGH! Well after work me and Christina went to Ruby Tuesday's to eat, and I saw Tiffany there who I thought was cool with me apparently I was wrong? her boyfriend came up and told me she was salty at me for talking shit on her, dude whatever? I never said anything about her, I don't have time to talk shit on anyone I dont' even have time to talk to anyone so it's whatever. Then Christina's sister who is friends with Tiffany told Tiffany to come over and she was like no I don't feel like standing next to a whore. And everyone in the resturant all looked around and I was like ""it's ok everyone the whore she was talking about was me"" I guess I'm a whore now? Who would have thunk it? Anyway It's 2 more minutes till my birthday! YAY! Ok i'm gonna go to sleep and open some presents in the morning and eat some turkey with ranch dressing, yummy! Have a good holiday !"

"event","I'm bored guys, seriously utterly bored. My weekend wasn't to full of excitement so i'm sitting here at 10:48 completely miserable. On Friday night I didn't do anything besides going shopping with my mom, which was fun cuz she bought me some clothes, even though she said she was going to kick me out if I bought any more clothes HA! Hypocrit, but you gotta love my mom. Saturday I woke up early to get ready for Casey's baby shower since Alycia was picking me up. But the baby shower was really nice, and Casey looked so good. Aww! I can't believe she is having a baby, I'm so happy for her! Anyway I actually had a little buzz at the shower, those damn long island ice teas were strong! So after the shower, Alycia, Eric and me went to South Street and went in all the sex and pointy shoe stores to buy some ""stuff"". After that we all went to Tom Jones but I wasn't feelin to good, and I was really tired so I couldn't wait to get home and go to sleep, we were all really exhausted for some reason. But anyway .... I woke up today and felt fine, so it's all good! But I had to work another Sunday and train somebody and get the store ready for the Distric Manager's visit today so it was not fun. But oh wellz I'm going to go now - work tomorrow at 3. 
6 more months till I leave - tear! I'm gonna miss everyone"

"event","Hey ya'll another crazy weekend. I think if I write all the details you may not wanna read it all but it's alright I'll see what I can do for everyone! So Friday (Halloween) me and my girl Christina were working together so we came up with a crazy idea to be Christina Aguilera and Britney since we worked that night. Of course I was Christina and my outfit looked hott! Christina looked might tasty too, hehe. But anyway, at the end of work Tim walked by and was all like ""hey baby, you look good"" Dude, why does this kid do this to me, he ignores me all the time and randomly talks to me when he thinks I finally lose interest, well guess what? I'm off it sucka, peace! Anyway me and Christina smoke a ciggerate outside after work and he decides to come up to us (out of his way) to see what we were doing that night, saying how there was all these parties in West Chester, yeah and his point was? I wouldn't go to any party with him if he bound and dragged me. Anyway we ended up going over her friends house, who by the way I went on a date with. Well we go there after work and figure hey it's a Halloween party, we can stay in our costumes... Yeah we were the only ones that thought that way. Every girl was giving us dirty ass looks, Hatin Bitches! Well once I started drinkin I was having a better time except for that fact the kid I went out on a date with was all up on me, and i'm sorry i'm not sweatin him AT ALL! However, he is a police guy thinger and had all these police things around so of course I start handcuffing people to other people, the stove, doors everything. It was great, untill everyone turned on me and handcuffed me to a chair who turned out to be my best friend that night cuz they lost the keys and i carried that mother fucker everywhere. So, anyway somehow (don't remember how) me and some Boy named (get this) D Unit started shit with me, and like slapped me so knowing the drunkin bitch I am, I grab the fuckin night stick and start hittin him saying bullshit like "" don't ever disrespect me, or hit a lady blah blah blah"" So he proceeds to give his girlfriend a call asking her to come up or something ... So I in turn call my boy Ken who says he wants to come up squad deep and fuck his night up. But at the end we actually started being really cool somehow? We knew all the same people, so it was straight. Well some mute boy has a mad crush on Xtina, and got pissed she was all cuddling with this one boy so after the party @ around 4:00 in the morning? We roll up to Xtinas hook up boys house and the mute boy is there (he's mute cuz I never heard him talk?) And tries to fight him even though they are like best friends. Well in the midst of the rumble Xtinas mom calls and tells her not to come home all pissed off, cuz it was so late. So we had no where to sleep. So after the non-fight fight, we go to the country squire and get hit on by Drunkin Latin Soccer players? HA! So we peel out and try to think of somewhere to sleep, no luck. We ending up having to get a motel at a sleezy yucky place (alpine inn) Eww just thinkin about it makes me cringe, it was nasty. Well after about 4 hours of sleep I had to drop Xtina off, and go home. Well I tried to sleep but Darkness Falls was on and Kristy called me and reminded me the Tony Hawk boom boom huckjam was tonight. So I got in the shower, got all ready and went to Wilmington to pick her up and go to the Tony Hawk thinger. Well it was freaking awesome! I'm not really interested in all that skateboarding, and biking stuff but they were amazing. And... all I have to say is Brian Deegan is fucking the hottest guy ever! Me and Kristy we so sweating on him, and we had great seats - about 20 feet from where the interveiws were. So when Brian Deegan was interviewed me walked down to the stage thing and starting screamin and waving and all, and he looked up and smiled. The interveiw guy was like what do you like best about all this and then he named all this stuff and was like and the ladies and pointed at us. I was so in heaven! Aww baby. WEll at intermission we went to smoke a ciggerate and some guy was all trying to pick up Kristy well I kinda laid low and just sat there untill he came over and ordered me and drink and was just trying to be nice to her, but he really wanted to talk to me. He was really nice and he reminded me of Matty because he was just as silly as him so we talk for about half hour and he asks us to go up to his seats, and at the point Kristy found out he was trying to get on me and not her so instead of being all hype and wanting to hang out with him she all grabs me by the arm and was like come on. I went becuase she did buy me the tickets for my Bday, so I mean I couldn't just diss her BUT I was thinkin what a selfish bitch all these guys were all up on her junk and the one guy that was sweatin me she pulled me away from. I mean he was 28 and a lil drunk but he was fun and thats all that matters. WEll everyone I just wrote WAAAYY to much for my so called ""summery of the weekend"" and i'm working off 4 hours of sleep and I still wanna call my Jersey boy (he's so cute!) So all ya'll later! Love ya's!"

"event","Well a lot has happend in a few days. You remember the perfect guy I was telling you about the cute, nice, adorable guy well... he's no so perfect after all I guess. He told me he wouldn't dick me over like all the rest of the guys and treat me like shit and hurt me, guess what? he dicked me over, treated me like shit and hurt me... damn i'm like 0 for 12,458 now huh? Well I guess it didn't hurt so bad this time cuz I kinda of expected it, I always have a feeling when guys lose interest and when when it's with me, it's all too fast. I hate that feeling when you miss someone though, it really sucks. I always feel like I take advantage of a moment, like when i'm with a guy and we are kissing, or laying together or holding hands I think back on it and I wish I could have made the most of it, like ""damn I wish I held on to him a little bit longer cuz tomorrow I may not be with him anymore"" I hate that feeling so much if I just would have know that Kevin would dick me over I would have held on to him a little bit longer or if Tim would have had sex with someone else I would have hung out with him more or if Rob was thinking about asking someone else out I would have called him more, I mean it's inevitable they still would have done all that but at least I would have had the chance to hold on just a little bit longer then I did, because in the end i'm the one left with nothing. I mean I really don't have many people to talk to, and basically me whole time is spent working. Kristy definitely left me to move in with some guy she likes who by the way has a girlfriend. So besides Tyrell and occasionally Tammy or Alycia I really don't have many people to talk to. But I did however, get flowers at work from some random boy who turned out to be really nice and not a psycho, which is good. I talked to him for like 2 hours yesterday and he's really sweet but he lives 3 hours away. Why is their always something that stands in my way ? I just don't get it... Oh well it gives me something to wonder about tonight when I should be out having fun goodnight kiddies! Have fun for me!"

I worked with Ty tonight and we are gettin along so much better I forgot how much fun we have. He told me the truth was he doesn't like Kristy and I guess he has his reasons. Unfortuatly she is moving to Newark since she moved outta her house. I basically did the same thing a few months ago and I didn't realize how stupid I was untill I see someone else go through the same things, I mean what is she running from. She has it great? I don't get it! So basically I won't get to see her anymore cuz I don't feel like driving up to Newark everyday. So thats my entry for the day HA it sucks oh well love yas!"

But when I left I just missed him and he told me to call him as soon as I got home so I did of course, and he didn't answer. He better be asleep or he has some explainin to do!

"event","Hmm so me and Kristy decided to chill where else but Deleware. Well i'm all gettin tired of that shit, and it's getting old quick. I hate driving all the way up there, and then finding out no one is gettin up. Well thats exactly what happend tonight. Kris's girl completely dissed her, and we winded up sitting in the parking lot waiting for her for like and hour. So we drive to Peppi's house, and nothing is going on there. Well while Kristy was on my cell phone for like 3 hours she forgot to mention I had a beep, cuz she's a bitch like that. Well they left a message and it was Kevin. I was so hype, cuz I thought he dissed me the other night but it was just a misunderstanding. So he told me he was trying to get up with us, cuz he and his boy wanted to chill. Well Kristy wanted to stay down deleware, fuck that though, it's my fuckin car and I cart her around everywhere she wants to go and she tries to tell me she don't wanna go to my boy's house, nah! So, I was like fuck you I'm going, so we ended up going there. Well this kid has a hype crib, and he's so hot. But we all had to bounce at like 11:45 cuz Kristy's dad wanted her to go home, cuz both her parents are evil, and of course I wanted to chill wit my boy but like a good friend I carted her house back home, syke I love that chick to death though. So I was all bummed when I got home and Stefanko kept callin me to get up with him, but they were all sorts of drunk and they are just not fun to be with when they are shitfaced. So I sit down and my cell phone starts ringing, and it's Kevin. Well I thought he didn't like me cuz we weren't there for awhile and I thought he thought I was just dissin him and he didn't talk to me really when I was there. Well he called me and we talked for a while, and he's just a hottie. I don't know why he's talkin to me? I can't wait till tomorrow till I can see him at work, and we are gonna go out tomorrow. Well I'm gonna go to bed cuz I promised him I would call him when I woke up, tee hee. I think I'm done wit Justin, Mike etc. I just want him. But ya'll watch in 2 weeks he'll completely dick me and i'll be crying to ya'll about it... Oh well you love me anyway!"

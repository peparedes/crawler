"event","back by unpopular demand in the wee hours of the night or morning depending on if you are coming or going its previously drunk pam of clear and sound mind to bring to you the deep questions with none of the answers you seek. 
ok lets talk seriously now....steaklettes!....thats right this exists. apparently my mother thought she was doing me a favor by buying this sorry ass vegetarian excuse for steak. I know just thinking about it makes you uneasy but imagine the pain i endured by eating it. right about now is when you ask yourself then why eat it?...(BECAUSE ITS THERE)hunger knows no discrimination, even if it does taste like barns smell
The thing that pisses me off the most is how this genius plan of vegetarian steak came to fruition. I mean i would love to meet the jerk sitting around going ""you know what this world needs tofu steak"" but even more so i want to meet the complete idiot that said ""that's so good it just might work"" i hope somewhere probably in the midwest i'm guessing, (wow its easy to hate on hicks) these two are hanging their heads in shame.Nooo! bad steaklette people! ok now on to bigger and better things like bio dome and sleep, but before i go:
screw you steaklettes and all of your tofu forgery"

because it is the only joyful noise i make at night
and i always say please
thankyou i might
forget
Fighting is like breathing to me
hold it in as long as i can
but eventually i gasp at you
and you take it all right
but not for long 
pretty soon you might just
breathe out all the festered air i made you inhale
exhale my cigarette into the night
til its morning and everything is fine
in this tainted air i create a passageway of hope
where today might shine
TODAY i will be better
TODAY i will sing your praises
but come tonight
i just might
grind my teeth
and gasp my grief at you"

"event","I can feel it slipping..winter that is...just slowly recoiling back to the cold winds of the north. I should be studying but then again I never do the things I should. I should be sleeping but then again I have this terrible need to stay awake. What if i miss something? Sometimes I feel like I miss to much. I miss my friends at home. I miss being a child, although I am a child at heart. Mostly I miss that feeling like I could have conquered the world if I wanted. There is still something that resides in me. Some kind of longing that still lingers. I try to ignore it now because when ever I try to focus on that feeling of endless hope I lose faith in myself. This makes no sense I know. I don't even know why I bother to speak sometimes considering I can't even keep my own attention. 
     There is a very big part of me that just always feels disconnected. I feel like I am just an aimless blob right now. There are so many things that I have been ignoring,they eat away at me these little monsters that crawl into my thoughts and make me question until all i have are stupid general questions that when broken down have no answers. Sometimes I like to pretend things are simple. I have done a pretty good job so far I think of dealing with what I have been given, but I must confess I always wanted more and no i'm not talking about wealth or comfort. Comfort is a crutch and wealth is even more fleeting than beauty(if you can believe that) I long for simple things though. A unified family, a peaceful mind, a place that feels like home. I don't get jealous of people who have these things but I would be lying if I didn't admit that it puts a distinct taste of lonliness in my mouth whenever I am shown that they do exist just not in my world. I thought about my father a lot today. Its odd how he used to be the person I looked to to make me feel loved. I built up this image of a man who cared when no one else did only to realize like many people he can only care when he has some kind of investment in it. 
     I'm not angry raelly. I don't have the strength to be angry at my family anymore. I just wish that I knew who they were. Sure someday I may have a family of my own and I can have everything I missed out on. Its a nice thought but I get this terrible feeling that I am capable of the same evils. Almost like the hate runs in my blood. Thats kind of creepy I know but it makes me scared to think I have these tendencies. I try to be a good person but trying and doing are so far apart these days. Who am I to claim to be hurt by them I haven't tried to contact anyone in my family minus my mom in forever. Part of me is afraid they wouldn't want to hear from me but mostly I'm scared taht the second I talk to them I will be that angry little girl stuck right back in that crappy little brick house I fought so hard to be free from. Why am I saying all this? I have no idea. Part of me knows no one will really read it, unless they are looking to be disgusted by my pathetic whining. The funny part is though I don't think I was ever really free. There are definite moments where I felt the weight lifted. Mostly when i'm drunk haha or just around people who love me. Its strange but I feel like my friends have been my family more than my family. Its such a stupid thing to care about I get so angry at myself for not being able to truly put all that mess behind me. For chists sake i'm almost twenty and I sound like an angsty little twelve year old. Granted I might look like one but thats besides the point. I'm sure there are tons of people out there who are in the same boat. Yea i'm a cornball I know but that part in Garden State where he says ""maybe thats all family really is. A group of people who miss the same imaginary place"" I guess that sums up how I feel right now. My home never existed but if someday I can find people who long for a home as much as I do well there isn't much more I would dream of asking for from this life. For now though I am just a nomad I've always been. 

I feel like the shitiest person in the world. I actually got excited about money my aunt left me what a selfish fucking bitch i am because shes gone and i had the nerve to be exicted that she left me money! I would give anything to change everything that happened and I will forever know that I was not there when she needed me. I deserve nothing especially not from her. I miss her more everyday. Even that is for selfish reasons. I wish I could have shown her how much I did care...for my sake or for hers? There it is my tendenices to be a selfserving asshole just like the rest of the psarreas clan...I'm so screwed"

"event","Since I couldn't sleep I figured I would write yet another pointless ramble that probably two people will read anyway. Kimbo the beach hobo is here which kicksass i missed her so much. I'm not very good at telling the people I care about how much they mean to me i never have been. I'm an ass like that but I can put it in writing from time to time no matter how unarticulate it may be. I really do love my friends so much though. There are just those rare few that become like family and you know no matter where they go what they do or who they become they will always be a part of you. I take for granted sometimes that the people that I love just know this. Everyone does I know i'm not alone in it. It is just such an easy trap to fall into. I would love to be the type of person that could make people know daily how much they mean to me. Its weird but sometimes when I sit down and really think about it I am just so consumed with love that i don't know what to do or where to place it. I used to think that everyone walks through this world alone. I still do every once in awhile but mostly I am grateful. I am grateful to be blessed enough to have people in my life to love. I don't ever want to forget that again. I know i will its just the way life goes but I think my new thing will be to try harder to appreciate people. I owe them that much. Because these people, these loves of my life, have given more than I probably ever deserve and the least i can do is give a little back.   Yea I know i am wonderfully emotional at these late hours but its here in the dark when no one is looking that i am capable of letting all this out. Its childlike i know but honestly who wants to grow up. I'd rather think that i can still love with this childlike faith. There is nothing more comforting than knowing that you can love with no strings attached PS: if there are any stupid cliches i forgot I apologize. Lord knows I can be absent minded at times"

"event","This is the tale of the amazing pam and her amazing adventures. Warning if you have half a brain just don't bother. Late one evening after a couple hours of sitting pam decided that she was not only capable but badass enough to walk about gee a million(two) miles back to her nice warm(sweltering) apartment. The cold was fierce and bitting but she walked on with determination in her heart b/c she knew that back at home a flask half full was waitng up for her. Onward our heroin pushed with mounds of snow encasing her and with now where to go but ahead she was left with a decsion we all must face in the winter. Do i step in the small puddle or the larger one? I know you might assume the small one but NOOO it is a cruel trick played by the potholes of this city. The smaller one was indeed deeper. This of course dampened poor little pams spirits and not to mention her feet. Then like a beacon calling to her as the only safe haven one can take in Boston at 1:30 am was none other than store 24 the place she had come to know and love as the place that always had vanilla cloves. Hmm she thought some hot chocolate sounds nice...but what was this no marshmellows...disheartened but in need of warmth she purchased a nice steaming cup of legal speed. She was ready for anything now....or was she...little did she know that drunken morons lurked ahead. The bumbling fools knocking into her spilling the nice hot drug all over her. As she watched the cup dashed to the floor her heart filled with anguish. This however did not discourage little pam no no she knew what she had to do...after all the liqour would not drink itself. Suddenly a feeling of worry crept up her spine and she felt the pressing nature of this matter. She began to walk faster and faster until her pace equalled that of a fox(thats right i said fox)Three more blocks! Two! keys!! Where the fuck are my keys! The door flew open she ran up the stairs into her cozy apartment dashed into her room reached into her desk drawer opened the flask...and alas the dumbshit forgot that she already drank the rest of it yesterday...she went to bed sober but not without dreams of tequila dancing in her head with little mexican men in cute little sombreros"

"event","ok studying blows but who ever tires of stupid generic lists
Here is a personal fav...Men not to date:
1.)Momma's boys...sorry its only cute until your balls drop after that it just comes off as you not having any
2.)Metrosexual.. i have a lil bit of a conflict here because i argue as to whether or not these men are even into dating women
3.)Potheads...love em...kinda am one at times...but lets face it to a true pothead weed is their only lover...you are just the girl they cheat on her with
4.)Men who wear tighter pants than you/ wear pink...both are inexusable...where are these men getting their fashion sense ambiguous sexuality for the blind stores...yea seriously stop confusing us!
5.)Men who claim they are good in bed...they are not...at all
6.)Mark Feedler(that one is for you heather)
7.)Musicians...they are great friends...fun and creative...unless you are the hottest thing on the planet you will not keep their attention long...(note:there are exceptions to this one...use your discretion)
8.)The Crappy Gift Guy...this guy puts zero thought into well anything...including you...this guy buys you crappy presents like glow in the dark sex dice...clearly this is not for you..its for them...selfish bastards
9.)The ""i'm a good guy"" Guy... any guy that says this to you within a 48 hour period of knowing you...you shouldn't bother knowning...he will magically become an asshole after you give him what he wants...funny how things happen like that
10.)The perpetual ball scrather...wtf dude what is wrong with them they can't itch that much... go see a doctor or something...warning this guy either thinks that somehow he needs to remind you he has balls(very good)...or he is diseased...either way this is one any gal can do without
11.)The Face Licker/Ear Freak...yes there are men that think its sexy to lick your face slowly...i'm not a salt lick get off me... or stick his entire tongue into your ear...if i needed a q-tip i would ask for one...and that can't taste good 
12.)Emo Kids...this one speaks for itself...go fucking cry about it somewhere else dude..i really don't care that your turtle died when you were six and your still not over it...pussy
13.)The Confused Thug...he is white...he is rich...he is dumb
14.)The Pseudo Intellectual...you know the kind that speak in isms...you will never be as smart as him because he is too dumb to realize he's stupid
15.)Film Majors...they make their lives like movies...your relationship will either be a cheesy romantic comedy...or worse a vomit inducing tragic love story
16.)The ""talented"" Guy..you know the guy he thinks he is kick ass at art or music or acting or something..but really he just sucks at it and not to mention life...the most heinous thing this type of guy does is not only does he make you experience his pathetic attempts to be creative...he makes you say you like them!..ick
17.)The ""Loner""...yea there is a reason he is alone girls...no one wanted to touch that mess in the first place
18.)The Frat Guy...yes i had to put it up because for some reason girls keep making this mistake...no you are not the only girl he shows his room too...he does do it all the time... and your eyes aren't that beautiful he didn't get lost and he doesn't want a map
19.)Guys who pop their collar/wear burberry...nooooo...bad men...bad
20.)The ""i think porno is like real life"" Guy...you ladies know him...the one that wants you to say and do things you have only seen in quality flicks like ""Saving Ryan's Privates""...thats what the movie is for ass...so you don't inflict your weirdo fantasies on us real women

I hope this has been enjoyable or at least informative...don't worry the list is always growing to accomodate new and rare breeds of gross men...oh and before i get tons guys saying that it is fucked up...don't bother...its a joke...kinda...and you would only be admitting that you are on the list"

Life is difficult. Budhists accept this but desire to work with the nature of life and find a place where you can be satifsied with lifes difficulty. Too bad most of us aren't budhist eh? Seriously though it seems that everywhere I turn I find someone who is petrified to live? What is happening in our society that makes otherwise perfectly healthy young adults scared of human bonds? No matter what the situation or the reason there is a common thread: fear. Truly a powerful emotion and coming from a person that struggles with anxiety I am more than comfortable saying... its a fucking lame excuse!... I don't mean to be cruel or not understanding to others i think i'm pretty good at helping people and being compassionate ...but people enough is enough... stop acting like no one knows you pain! Again i can relate to feeling this way i spent a good portion of my growing up feeling alone and disconnected... feeling like no one knew my sorrow but the older i get the more i realize that everyone has mountains to climb sure some are larger than others but i am a very firm believer that God does not give us challenges that we can not rise too.So rise up damnit and accept your fate. Life is a gray area mixed with pain and sorrow but how will we ever learn to appreciate the extrodinary if we never experience the mundane.I would rather spend my entire life in pain if only to find ultimate happiness...than coast through this world never knowing what it is like to love someone with all of my power... I am proud to say that I haved loved with the greatest passion  my being is capable of and in turn i have had my heart shattered bruised and torn... i love that!(and no i am not a masochist) every little scar...every little insecurity... every little flaw... they have made me someone who is able to love with all of my heart...i appreciate everyone in my life so much more because if this... i don't mean to be preachy or self rightious...just seems like it is relevant for me to say all this...sure maybe i am widely optimistic but maybe i am just sick of watching people i care about sell themselves short... human beings deserve love...don't cut off your chances to care because when you start doing that you'll find that there is no one to care about you because you have chased them all away"

"event","ok so i have just discovered that apparently my underwear was made in israel... i wonder where this massive victoria secret factory is in israel
because i was under the impression that it was like this land that people fought holy wars over what was there a compromise i'm not aware of...did the israelis stand up and finally say what has been on everyones minds
""lets declare peace in the middleeast and while we are at it how about that new victorias secret catalogue""(by the way the jewelry underwear just looks painful) but hell i guess this lil name on my underwear is more reassuring that those three lil letters every company dreds... USA ...at least i have the jews on my side with this one i mean i have so much faith that god's chosen people would make a quality thong... so thank you israel for your fine craftsmenship and adorable jewish men taboot...oh yea i have about five million other things i should be doing right now but this was just way too good and i can shut my mind off.. only one problem i haven't a clue how to turn it back on... i need help...you know in life"

"event","wow how sad am I...no one is up to entertain me so i actually did this stupid journal crap just to give myself something to do. Yeah thats just what i need another journal. I guess this doesn't count though because its all hip and computer dorky thats what i will tell myself at least. Yes i realize i just used hip and computer dork in the same sentence but hell who can keep up with all you crazy kids and your complex lingo. Which reminds me I have to stop talking like a fifty year old man,its a lttle strange. I'll put that on my list of things to do but will mostly likely not care enough to accomplish list. thats what i call it these days. I mean why lie to myself the only things i ever accomplsih on my to do list are going grocery shopping because lets face it i love my food. (Oh yea by grocery shopping i mean buying milk and eggs and then ordering pizza) I try i do but i am just not domestic at all. Its not my fault really look at my mom she orders thanksgiving from caterers. smart woman she is wasting money we don't have so she doesn't have to cook. Thanks mom because of you i can't even wrap up left over pizza properly...jess could tell you it was sad... nah i kid though thats not mommy's fault i'm just dumb apparently but shhh don't tell i still have a couple morons fooled. Oh well what i lack in domestic skill i'm sure i make up for somewhere else besides my husband if he does exist at all is going to be a kept man and do all that stuff anyways. I shouldn't be allowed in kitchens i just burn things..like myself...those oven doors are mighty tricky. Ok it offical i have seen every infomercial out there...top two the oreck challenge one just for the cute bald man that looks like mr magoo...and the clorox bleach one for its refreshingly informative begining. I highly recomend these two if you ever find yourself awake at three in the morning.i wonder if anyone ever rates them. like a zaggat guide to bad late night tv.don't worry folks i'm on it!the now music one is always good for a laugh. It always reminds me of little jenn the truth is out jenn owns now thats christmas and she is not ashamed(miss you ex-roomie)but not the now music thats just silly..ok  i have nothing interesting to say anymore...but jokes on you if you bothered to read this i still can't believe i bothered to write it...peace out homies keep on keepin on down with the man fuck the police and don't trust people who tell you to...trust me on this one"

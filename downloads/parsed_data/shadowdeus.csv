"event","There's this song I know called ""Karma's Payment"" by Modest Mouse. The singer proclaims repeatedly, ""I'm on the karma payment plan."" That line really makes me think. I figure it's a pretty apt description of the way life works for ordinary people like you and me.

It's cyclical: you got your good times and your bad times. Some days you're finding a job, or reconnecting with an old friend, or having an afternoon to relax. Other days, you're doing poorly on exams, or getting, say, a spinal tap. That's all there is. Oh sure, once in a while you have those unexpected moments: winning an Oscar, or losing your father to cancer. BUT, well adjusted people don't deal with these things forever, and eventually return to their regular karma payment plans.

Now being in college, it's really difficult not to view life in a cycle. I tend to look back at particular weeks and judge them as good or bad. I will often obsess over mistakes I've made in the past...but I consider myself grounded in the present. I feel hesitant to plan for or predict the future. I tend to focus on what is happening to me here and now, and what I can do about it. Gotta keep up with karma's payment, after all."

"event","Story time!

I get a text message from Orbitz yesterday. I <i>assumed</i> it's concerning my flight. (Actually, it wasn't.) The message vaguely said that the flight was now delayed until 6 pm, a whole two and a half hours after my original flight time. I guessed it was because of some inbound bad weather. I informed my parents of this, and worked the Northwest Airlines website to try and rebook the flight. For some reason, I couldn't, because of ""multiple reissues,"" probably meaning I had already rebooked it a few months ago. At this point, I accepted the fact that I was going to be stuck in the airport for about five hours, since my shuttle was getting there at 1 pm.

Early this morning, my mom sent me a text message saying that she managed to rebook my flight for tomorrow afternoon. I grumbled, asking her why she thought this was a good idea to do at the last possible minute. She said she would talk to the shuttle service and try and rebook my reservation.

A couple hours later, my dad called and gave me the lowdown. We can't rebook a shuttle for Sunday, or even Monday, because The Storm Of The Century is apparently making its way towards the Puget Sound. The shuttles have clamped up because they don't want to drive through it. He presented me with a choice: either I could re-attempt to rebook my flight (again) for today, and take the chance that I might be stuck in the airport (or a hotel, even) for a while; or I could just get settled and wait until things have (probably) cleared up by Tuesday and fly out then.

I called up Northwest, and they said that my original flight wasn't available anymore. It and the rest of today's flights were getting delays, too. So, it was with a heavy heart that I told them to rebook my flight for Tuesday afternoon. I also rebooked my shuttle reservation accordingly.

As it turns out, I was looking at that Orbitz text message, and they were talking about flight 162. My flight was 164. I'm kind of pissed now that I didn't realize this before. But can you blame me? If Orbitz sent me a text message about a delayed flight, I should assume it's mine, right? I guess it doesn't make any difference, anyway. My original flight is running into delays, so that would have sucked.

Now I just need to figure out what to do with myself for three days. I guess I'd better stock up on a little more food and hunker down with my Xbox. My laptop remains broken."

"event","The story so far.

Staff training was great and very helpful. A couple years ago when I was an assistant counselor, I wasn't able to come since high school extended into early June, and then when I got to camp I felt very disoriented. Now I feel like I'm more on the ball and more knowledgeable about the ins and outs of camp. Additionally, we did clinics for the more complicated program areas, which are sailing and horseback riding. I worked with the horses, and I feel a lot more comfortable around them than I used to. In a word, I feel accomplished.

Oy vey, though, last week was hell! I had a cabin of 8 and 9 year olds. I was expecting my co-counselor, Sam, to show up on the bus, but when everyone got off, he was nowhere to be seen. Alarm bells rang in my head, but I tried to keep a calm exterior. Later one of my bosses approached me and told me there was a scheduling goof and Sam was showing up on Wednesday, not Monday. The next couple of days were a bit of a struggle as I did my best to wrangle my pack of monkeys, with the help of a couple other staff members who aided me when they weren't busy. Somehow I even managed to take them on an overnight camping trip. When Sam finally arrived, it was a blessing, but the kids got progressively difficult over the week. One became chronically homesick, and the rest of them were at each other's throats a lot, tattling on each other nonstop. Finally the end of the week came, and I somehow wound up getting the ""Super Sweet Counselor"" award.

This week, since we're going to have almost as many staff as there are kids, I'm going to be working at target sports. Hopefully it will be a good change of pace."

I just talked to a professor in the theatre department. I'm strongly considering a major. My parents have been trying to caution me very strongly because theatre is a very tough industry to break into. The professor had some enlightening things to say. He gave a couple examples of what has happened to theatre graduates. One of the women he taught went on to do some directing in Seattle and is now attending one of the top directing programs in the nation, at Columbia. Another guy he worked with got into the industry. Eight years ago, he played a comic book clerk in ""Unbreakable;"" now he has the lead role in this film coming out called ""Otis."" Then he told me about a guy he acted alongside with when he was younger: he did a combination of theatre and something else for 15 years, got tired of it, started a family, and now is the creative director for Dairy Queen.

Funny thing happened on the way back: I was sitting at my gate in the Denver airport. All of the sudden, I notice that four sparrows have made their way into the terminal from the plane access port. It was both amusing and surreal. Naturally, some of the people waiting for the plane threw them scraps of food which they cheerfully snapped up.

I stirred awake at 7:04 am, looked at my clock, and went back to sleep, comfortable in the fact that the alarm would go off in about 40 minutes.

Flashforward to 9 am. I HAVE JUST WOKEN UP. I look at my phone and notice a flurry of text messages from my family telling me to wake up, plus a voicemail from my shuttle driver telling me that if I didn't show up at the designated time (in this case, 8:40), he would have no choice but to leave without me.

My reaction?

<b>""FUCK!""</b>

And the freakout began. Knowing that my family was already onboard their plane, I called the next most appropriate person: my uncle Adam in Aspen.

""Adam, I've got a problem. I missed my taxi! What should I do?!""

""Is this a joke?"" he replied. ""Are you kidding me?""

""No! What should I do?""

""Um, I dunno, call another taxi!?""

Duh.

So I hopped on the Internet, googled ""Tacoma taxi service,"" and was able to find a number in a matter of seconds. I called up this guy named Ken and he said he come pick me up in about 15 minutes. Thankfully for me, everything I needed (well, not everything as I've been figuring out today) was already in my duffel. I zipped it up, threw on some clothes, and headed out the door to the student center. Unfortunately the guy, Ken, got a little lost (saw him drive right past campus), so I had to call him up again to get him back on track.

Ken was an interesting fella. He told me a bunch of stories about himself--how was out of work for a while because of  edema (swelling) in his brain, how he met his wife, what his previous jobs were (truck driver, race car driver) and what his future job might be (limo driver). He seemed quite well-rehearsed in his delivery, which made me suspect that he's told this stuff to many a passenger.

The fare to the airport ended up costing $60, as opposed to the $27 it would have cost me to take the shuttle. It's the price I pay for oversleeping. Thankfully I made it to my flight with plenty of time.


Aspen is nice. I haven't been here in about 3 or 4 years. It's always surreal when I come here, especially at night--looking up at the sky and finding it obscured by the tall mountains.

"event","My dream last night, probably one of the weirdest and most drawn out in a long time:

I find myself on a road in the outskirts of a city near a desert. I look around and see a kid down the road. He's about my age. I've never seen him before in my life. He's standing next to this huge bottle full of some sort of clear liquid. My initial perception is that it's some sort of vodka. When I walk over to him, he offers me a drink. I take it straight from the bottle. As I put the bottle to my lips, I realize the drink tastes nothing like anything I've ever drank before, alcoholic or otherwise. It tastes like something wonderful.

We begin walking towards the city, carrying the bottle full of the wonderful liquid along with us. We each take swigs from it as we hike, saying almost nothing.

Eventually, we have come to the city. It's a thriving metropolis, with skyscrapers and everything. A river runs between us and the city. We walk on a bridge stretching over the river. When we reach the other side, the temperature has gotten colder. Much colder.

Near the other side of the bridge is a girl. Again, she's about my age and I've never seen her before. The boy and I walk over to her, and we begin a conversation. The tone of the conversation is desperate and hurried. I don't remember the specifics of what we talked about, but as I understand it now, the girl and boy needed to get out of the city by plane. The problem was, they didn't have a ticket, so they needed to sneak aboard the plane.

Suddenly, I find myself in a completely different place. As I understand it, it's an airport, and our trio is standing in the lobby outside the security checkpoint. The building is a big cylinder, with the checkpoint in an inner cylinder in the middle. Scattered along the edge of the building are airline representatives, dispensing tickets and taking luggage. There are conveyor belts taking the bags of luggage up to the second level of the airport.

But there's something quite bizarre about this airport: it's freezing, and the floor is lined with snow. Everyone is bundled up in jackets and snowpants as if they are about to go skiing. In fact, there's even pairs of skis lying about everywhere.

Without warning me, the girl and the boy make a break for one of the conveyor belts. They hop on the belt and begin riding up to the second level, supposedly where all the flight gates are. They call for me to come on, but something makes me hesitate.

Klaxons blare. I realize that Homeland Security has noticed the breach. Without thinking, I grab a pair of skis, slap them on my feet, and take off as the goons come rushing towards me. I take glee in their attempts to catch me; they slip and slide on the snow that's all over the floor. I make a couple of laps around the airport lobby.

Suddenly there's a flash of bright white light, and all the snow melts away. The skis fly off of my feet. At that moment, I notice my parents are standing there in the lobby, wearing snow gear like everyone else. I rush to their open arms. As they hold on to me, a high-ranking Homeland Security officer angrily marches over to me. She looks absolutely incensed. There's a taser in her hand, sparking menacingly. She grabs me, jabs the taser into my arm...

...and nothing happens to me. The taser short-circuits. The officer stares at the broken weapon in her hand. My parents use this moment to try and convince her to let me go. The officer looks at them with shock, and then begins arguing with them.

The last thing I remember is the officer's face. She looked insane. Her hair was frazzled. Sparks were shooting from her eyes. She wasn't in color, she was a creature of black-and-white."

On videotape


I'm having a very Radiohead-themed weekend, it seems like. I spent a great deal of last night watching various YouTube videos of their songs. I watched a Thom Yorke solo performance of ""Videotape"" three different times. His lyrics are amazingly introspective and emotional.

Smoked a cigar for the first time in four or five months last night. Nicotine really packs a wallop when you've been out of its reach for so long. I had this strange sort of euphoria and lightheadedness when I finished smoking the thing. I still have the taste of tar in my mouth, like I've just had a cup of coffee. There's definitely a yin-yang quality to cigars, that's for sure.

Hopefully signing a lease on a house in the next day or two. Excitement ensues."

Today we went to the costume closet and picked out our costumes. Here's what I've got for Lucifer:
-beater
-black and maroon bowling shirt
-black jeans
-trench coat
-reddish brown dress shoes which go up just past the heel (would that make them boots?)
This is probably my favorite costume of my acting career so far. Which isn't saying too much I guess, since it's only about two years long.

So it was back in the saddle again for the Ya! You Betcha! Hour. It felt good to be back, but Elly and I were just making little mistakes all over the place. I played Radiohead's ""Talk Show Host"" and totally forgot that Thom Yorke drops an f-bomb in there (twice), so we had to play our station's little disclaimer over the song, apologizing for the language. Elly refused to believe that we needed to play three (rather than two) songs per hour from the regular rotation albums. It wasn't until another DJ came in that I was able to validate my claim. I think we ended up with a little less than what our quota needed. No big deal, I guess.

Elise informed me today that she has a job at camp, which makes me very, very happy. :)

Other than that...well. I guess I had a pretty weird dinner tonight. Free pancakes at IHOP + three blazed friends = yeeeeeeeeeeee."

Hillary Clinton visited our campus, major WTF. We got an email the evening before she came, and then the next day the neighborhood was completely PACKED with Hillary supporters and the media. There was a line into our gymnasium which stretched at least half a mile.

"event","Oh my gawd, most packed Wednesday ever.

In the early afternoon I was out of the house for quite a while, running errands and doing speech stuff. Then I came home and killed time for a long time while waiting for my friend Elise to finish school. Finally she picked up her phone. (""Blimey, you're hard to get a hold of!"" I screeched.)

I learned that she was going to watch her friend sing at Famous Dave's at Calhoun Square, and they were planning to take the bus there. Once I had learned of this, I jumped in my car and made my way to Perpich, all the way over in Golden Valley. I almost literally had to wade through rush hour traffic because of that pesky oil spill on I94. When I finally arrived at the school, I found out they had missed the bus, which brought my racing mind to a halt.

Eventually they were ready to go, and we went out to the parking lot. I assumed Elise's friend, Minnah (sp?), had some sort of car as a backup. Instead, she said, ""Where is it?""

Oh. My car. Right.

So I was back in the driver's seat. We clumsily made our way over to Calhoun Square. Why the FUCK is Uptown Mpls so crowded on a Wednesday?! Parking was a bitch.

We walked to Famous Dave's, where we sat down at a table for five--Minnah had mentioned her parents were coming, so I foolishly made seats available for them. They did show up, later...but they didn't sit with us. They were with a crowd of about a dozen people. >_<

I ordered some chicken wings to eat, and asked Elise if she wanted something to eat. ""No,"" she insisted, ""I had a pretzel!"" 'Kay.

So eventually, the band Minnah was performing with--Dirty White Boyz--was ready to go. I enjoyed the show--it was a modern blues band, the kind with drawn-out guitar and harmonica sections. Minnah mainly did backing vocals, and led a rendition of ""These Boots Were Made For Walkin'"". I was impressed.

Eventually, poor sleep-deprived Elise remembered she had a project to do, so we left. After I dropped her off at Perpich, I made my own way home. I shoulda crashed into bed, but instead I stayed up and watched a couple episodes of Family Guy.

It was a cold, wet walk back to campus alone. I felt ashamed. I'm not sure why...I wasn't really sober at the time. The way my mind framed it, I was doing something bad because I had been hanging out with Kira for most of the evening and now I was leaving her behind without telling her. And even after I had left some stupid message on her Facebook wall, and even after she had replied back saying that she hadn't liked the party much either and had left shortly after I did...I still have a residual guilty conscience. Do I need a psychologist again?

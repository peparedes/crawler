"event","<p>I still felt tired when I woke up this morning. My legs still had an ache about them from all of yesterday's walking. Got up, and got myself outside and up to the airport from the shuttle. Sat down by sheer coincidence in the same place I sat the first day I went into the city. Slowly as we went towards Powell I noticed the same people getting on the BART and sitting in the same carriage in the same seat....that's just scary.<br /><br />Had a browse around Union Square again before taking a long uphill walk to Chinatown. There's some cool places around, but I did totally feel like a fish out of water. After browsing a really cool shop that was selling all kinds of anime stuff I moved on up, and ended back in Fisherman's Wharf again. I know Amy won't like it but I even went back into Pier 39 and went into a restauarant for lunch. There's something kinda sad about saying ""table for 1"" at the desk and I don't wanna do that again - even though there were other people sat by themselves in there. Got a really nice view of Alcatraz as I sat eating breaded shrimp, salmon and cod...lovely! Took some pictures of the sea lions that all converged outside, wandered around aimlessly but enjoying the sea air. I think I've done the wharf to death now,&nbsp; so I'm making plans for the Golden Gate bridge tomorrow.<br /><br />If nothing else I wanna get some pictures of it myself, I've had about 500 opportunities to just buy a framed print or whatever from the 100's of souvenir shops but that's just defeatist - I'm going there first hand no matter what. Also taken Amy's points on about other places to visit, I've got over a week still to go so I guess I'll pad it out some.#<br /><br />Right now I'm just enjoying some baseball while eating some monster burger and fries...I LOVE baseball, always have done but there's not much of it on in England. Whereas over here it's a huge part of American evening viewing it seems.</p>"

"event","OK, ages since I updated this journal. Nowadays I take the lazy mode option of having a Myspace and a Facebook. 

However I really feel the need to keep track of my trip to San Francisco. I got on the plane Monday afternoon English time and landed at 5pm PST...I could probably write a novel on my flight but I'll keep it brief. 

United Airlines - I flew with them when I went to Boston in 2000. They were a flawless airline, couldn't do enough to make me, my dad and my brother feel more comfortable and happy. However, 7 years on things have either changed or its just random draw whether you get a crew that gives a damn or doesn't :p 

This crew didn't...they just didn't care. We had a lot of turbulence going over Canada to the point where I thought we were all gonna die and the plane would crash etc. Anyway, we got there in once piece...I tackled the immigration control guys ok despite getting my luggage sniffed at by this really cool dog :p 

Got to my not so nice hotel. I swear it's an 80's relic that hasn't had much done to it since then...it reminds me of a hotel in my own town ""the Miami Hotel"" which is American styled. Anyway, I've settled in my room and I'm here til the 22nd. Only bad thing is I'm still TOO CLOSE to the airport, you can hear planes going overhead, and there's a DHL depot about 25 metres away from me so it's kinda noisy! 

Didn't go out the night I got here. Just wanted to bath and have a sleep. 

Next morning I got myself on the BART from the airport (after getting the shuttle service up there) and got off at Powell. Wow, it's so strange how I'm so far from home but it feels so ""right"" to be where I am...I went into some kind of shopping mall nearish to Union Square and had a look around. 

I swear it was totally a timewarp...all of Amy's posts in the past about Jamba Juice, Borders, Godiva - suddenly I'm there, I'm sampling, and I'm loving it. Makes me wish I'd come out way before now...and I'm so glad I'm here. 

After a lot of looking around the area I headed back, bit of a short day in all honesty but I've got plenty of time to see everything I wanna see. 


Now this morning I got up early again, had some breakfast and head back into the city. This time I got off at the last stop before leaving the Bay area (nearest BART stop to Fisherman's Wharf). I figured going up there to look around would be a cool thing. Went into a Borders, looking for some kinda book to read while I'm BART'ing around lol, there was this deaf girl in there who was really helpful - and I know she's mistreated by other customers because another guy asked her for help, she gave him the note that said she was deaf, and he just said ""Never mind"" and walked away...asshole.&nbsp;

Anyway, I've now sampled the McDonalds here...its SO good, I can see why America has an obesity problem, that could be me if I stayed too long.&nbsp;Walked up to Fisherman's wharf...went the wrong way and ended up outside the Giants baseball stadium, so walked all teh way back to where I was and beyond, and hit Pier 39 - probably one of the biggest hotspots in the city.

Took some pictures, I love the place. Tomorrow I dunno where I'm going yet but one way or another I'm exploring! I wanna go back to Fisherman's Wharf at some point but not yet, maybe Chinatown tomorrow - or further afield on the BART to Fremont or Pleasanton? Not sure. 

People seem to both love and hate my accent. I've caught a few glances from girls when I talk (at the airport to some guy, at my hotel reception and in Starbucks), but at the same time whenever I ask anyone for help. directions or when I order food from somewhere I have to say it 3 times...grrr! :(

Overall though I'm loving it, just wish I wasn't out here by myself in a way."

More personal than LiveJournal...I've actually used my name as a username this time, which I'm still getting used to (and no, I'm not an Eminem fan) :p

Quick ""life"" update.

Army career still pending. Royal Mail decide they want to advertise the job I applied for and didn't get...AGAIN! So, <b>one...last...try...!</b>

Interview/assessment at 10AM Wednesday.

If I get it, I start building my life the way I want it.

If I don't get it, it's a continuation of jogging myself til I'm almost throwing up and getting all sweaty in the name of trying to pass Basic Training standards :p

"event","OMG! I've just noticed on the Job Centre site that Royal Mail in Chelmsford are apparently looking for postmen, and despite me writing to them personally to try and get back in there they've just gone ahead and advertised in the Job Centre! Fuckers!

It's left me with a bit of a dilemma. Part of me wants to go and sign up for the Army (the time I did get down there the recruitment people were doing a school presentation! Fuckers!), but moreso a HUGE part of me wants to reapply to be a postman. I miss it so much, and they can't say no to me considering I've worked there for about a year in the past and I was one of their most reliable people.

Superb! Now all I have to do is phone their recruitment hotline at 8AM and have a 3-5 minute interview over the phone...shouldn't be too complex.

"event","Yeah, I'm having trouble sleeping lately. What's worse is my sleeping patterns are having a knockon effect on my daily routine, or the lack of one.

I'm now forcing myself to stay up. I've been meaning to get back down to the Army careers office since my last post (damn my lack of posting since) but today is the day I get in there and register my interest. I've been reading up on the careers pages on the site (http://www.army.mod.uk > careers page) and of everything there I think I'd go in as a Military Police solider guy. Not good in the sense that if I get posted at a checkpoint I could get blown into smitherines, but there's risk in whichever option I go for and at least I won't be in the infantry.

But yes, to get in I need to pass a medical, <b>and</b> a fitness test. The medical I'm fairly confident about, but the fitness test...well, to be blunt, I'm not quite so sure about. I need to get myself jogging again, I did start again briefly but I stopped. I would LOVE to be in good physical shape, it would be the first time in my life that I'd properly be able to run a few miles and not be so knackered I'd need to sleep for a day to recover lol.

Overall I just need to move out of my dad's place. I'm sick of him, his comments and I'm sick of having no ""direction"" that I REALLY want to go in. Uni I can still do, maybe in 4-5 years time when I'm out of the Army. But that's just babble, I'm not in yet!

Well indeed. Anyway I've somehow got to last til tonight before I sleep...I'm armed with Red Bull and a bundle of determination. Whether I actually manage it is another matter ;p"

As a result (and with some colour changes) I've found a really nice layout with colour scheme to match!

Now, if only I could make myself a few icons to go with it :D"

"event","Sooo...there's last posts and there's ""last posts"". I had a feeling I'd be back to writing journal entries, yet now I've got here I don't quite know what to write!

Christmas was the best one I've had in YEARS. Nice quiet one with my mum and Michael's family. It's made me realise how far I've come with them in the last couple of years... I used to hate being in their company at all but I'm at a point where I can tolerate them now but both ""sides"" know that there's no friendship there - if my mum and their dad split up there's no way we'd keep in contact. But yeah, Christmas was good.

Domino's is outta there! I no longer deliver pizzas for work as of 23rd December and I'm extremely relieved. Now all I have to do is find myself a full-time job. I'm still hoping on Royal Mail, that they'll take me back in and all, but I'm not relying on it and I'm going to look as hard as I can. Lots of people change jobs when a new year hits, and I'm no exception ;)

The Lucina saga still sort of continues...we're just friends, and she's engaged to this guy who basically forced her into it emotionally, but I know her, she's not happy at being tied down and a lot of people say that her and him aren't a good match. It was her birthday on New Year's day. Her boyfriend/fiance went, which meant I couldn't go because apparently he'd have been upset if I had. WTF? So I need to give her the birthday present/card I bought her and I've written her a letter as well, basically apologising for some of what happened last year. I don't know how she'll take the letter but it came from the heart so if it goes down badly at least I can say I've been honest lol.

I'm still hooked on Warcraft. I see what it does to me and how it affects my sleeping patterns and all yet I still play. If I gave it up there would be this HUGE void of spare time to fill - quite scary just thinking about it, if you spoke into it, it would echo! ;)

I've made a new year resolution this year...to treat people like a normal person would, not like a Luke of 2005 and earlier would. I really do screw up sometimes in all areas of my life, and I hate it when I do, yet I don't stop to change what I've done. So that ends in 2005.

I'm starving, there's no food in the house... I think I'm gonna venture out into town. I need to buy Danielle a birthday card and present while I'm there as I'm meeting her and Elaine tomorrow night. She wants me to drive to Basildon! I haven't been there in years but I know it's a dodgy area, but it's her birthday so I said I'd take her, I just hope the car holds up.

Speaking of the car - its a piece of shit! I've had nothing but problems since I've had it and the latest in a catalogue of errors is the brakes losing their grip. Fantastic. Fixed now but it happened right on Christmas so I've not had my car in a while.

Hmmm, what else? Oh, I still haven't won the lottery! ;(

EDIT: WTF is this?

"event","...well I dont know if ive made a drunk post before but there's a first time for everything.

I've just come back from a local nightclub and after screwing things up with Lucina again I've come to the realisation that this world is a load of shit and I just don't fit in no matter what angle I come from or how hard I try.

The real me doesn't belong in society. I'm not going up the job ladder or ""achieving"" anything. What use am I? At 24 I'm not getting any younger either. I'll always have dreams and aspirations but without the motivation to achieve them I'm going to be stuck in limbo, this vicious cycle where my lack of action achieves me nothing. Acting only leads to an inevitable failure, take my return to college for example... why go back if all you come out with is two bare minimum passes and one grade up from the minimum? 2 years wasted.

For the first time tonight I thought about giving the Samaritans a call... but then I thought ""Well, you'd only be wasting their time Luke"".

I need my old job back... some kind of stability, anything."

"event","I got my A-Level results on Thursday. What I've basically put into the last 2 years came out, and to say I'm disappointed with June's exams is a huge understatement. My English papers for instance were HUGELY below what I was expecting, scoring 32/90 and 33/90. What the hell? I wrote a great answer to the unseen poetry and Wuthering Heights vs Return of the Native...

...Hertfordshire Uni were on the phone to me before I even got there. Turns out the law results had been FUBAR'd. OCR (the exam board) have sorted it now, but again my results were way below what I expected. I feel like I've wasted 2 years in a way, although non-academically I feel like the experience has been mega positive. Whether I get into uni now hinges on me TALKING my way in...and I'm no salesman even if I am very well mannered in conversation when I need to 'put it on'.

Well I've got work to get to for 12pm. The V Festival is going on over the road today and tomorrow. I can't go though, not just because I haven't got a ticket but I'm working 12-9 both days. Blah, next year!"

"event","I can't wait for this weekend to be out of the way. For a 5 hour shift tonight it dragged, dragged, then dragged some more. Usually when its busy at least I can not look at the clock for an hour or so and then think ""Wow, time is flying..."" but not tonight.

People are getting tight with their tips as well. I never rely on my tips for anything, but anyone who works in a bar or as a taxi driver or a pizza delivery driver will know - they add that warm ray of sunshine at the end of a shift, the ""bonus"" money on top of the wages. Ahh! Nice!

I have a 12-9 shift to do tomorrow, followed by a 12-9 shift on Sunday and a 5-11 (close) shift on Monday night. Its not hard work, its just having to be there and drive around constantly. Driving so often has meant a few near misses...I just lose my focus for a split second sometimes and it has meant I've almost hit sides of cars and stuff.

Just when I thought I'd escaped the vice-like grip of Warcraft I tried the battleground environment (PvP) and dammit, I'm hooked!! Partly I think because shamen do so well. As an EQ shammie (who couldn't take too many hits) its nice to be able to run around having others fear your presence for once =P

I'm low on LJ post material, I think it's showing! =P

Danielle isn't happy at the moment, I don't think I've ever mentioned her in LJ in any depth but she's down about her parents moving to Devon and her boyfriend isn't being very supportive. I've offered to lend an ear if she wants to talk... she said she'll be fine in a day or two. I dunno what's going on but it's not really any of my business.

Bought a new t-shirt from H&M... it's very typical Luke style, long sleeved, red with white arms on it. I need to move away from such fashion onto something else - a makeover is what I need! =P

My mum phoned me and asked if I wanted to come over for dinner. I couldn't say no as I urgently needed to do some washing and so I've had two big meals today...list as follows:-

4 x Chicken Feast pizza slices
Half a portion of wedges
1 x Ice Cream (with chocolate sauce)
1 x Chicken dinner (with potatoes, carrots, peas and yorkshire puddings)
1 x bowl of Haagen Dazs ice cream (Banoffee)

2 x Dr Pepper (glasses)
2 x Pepsi (glasses)

"event","<i>SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean man who played computer games for 50 hours almost non-stop died of heart failure minutes after finishing his mammoth session in an Internet cafe, authorities said on Tuesday.

The 28-year-old man, identified only by his family name Lee, had been playing on-line battle simulation games at the cybercafe in the southeastern city of Taegu, police said.

Lee had planted himself in front of a computer monitor to play on-line games on August 3. He only left the spot over the next three days to go to the toilet and take brief naps on a makeshift bed, they said.

""We presume the cause of death was heart failure stemming from exhaustion,"" a Taegu provincial police official said by telephone.

Lee had recently quit his job to spend more time playing games, the daily JoongAng Ilbo reported after interviewing former work colleagues and staff at the Internet cafe.

After he failed to return home, Lee's mother asked his former colleagues to find him. When they reached the cafe, Lee said he would finish the game and then go home, the paper reported.

He died a few minutes later, it said.

South Korea, one of the most wired countries in the world, has a large and highly developed game industry.</i>


Good grief, I <b><u>ONCE</u></b> played EQ two days straight back in 2001 without sleep. I found I had a ""second wind"" about 4-5 times before giving up and climbing into bed. Climbing into bed has never felt quite so satisfying since that night lol.

Makes you wonder about EQ/EQ2/Warcraft/etc players - I know some are of that mindset =P"

"event","I'm so full right now...I've eaten too much today, so much I'm going to list it (and then probably shock myself afterwards - here goes).

1 x Banana
1 x McDonalds double cheeseburger
1 x McDonalds large fries
<i>(that's less than I usually have at Maccie D's)...</i>
2 x Chicken caesar tortilla wraps
1 x Cheese and tomato roll <i>(had to be eaten today, my dad left it in the fridge too long)</i>
1 x Scotch egg
1 x Fruit 'n' Nut chocolate bar
4 x Biscuits

1 x Frijj Limited Edition Chocolate Brownie Milkshake <i>(I'm excusing myself that, it's limited edition after all!)</i>
1 x can of Coca-Cola
2 x 500ml of Lucozade orange

...I dunno, is that loads? It's a lot for me, and I swear to god I've put on weight since last week. Why am I eating so much? I'm not sure if I have an in-the-works problem with my liver but I do tend to be drinking a lot - but then I always have.

Anyway, James phoned last night and asked if we were still on for today. I'd totally forgotten and hadn't planned anything luckily so I said yes, he said to meet him in town at 2PM.

Luke is a dizzy fool though, and turned up at James's house at 2PM. What's worse is it didn't click, I wondered why the hell he wasn't in (nobody was there) and assumed as his mum's car wasn't there he was late coming back somewhere with her. I went for a walk - James lives in Great Baddow which is where my happiest childhood memories lie before I got ripped out of the school and moved to another one (incidentally that's what made me so shy/withdrawn/antisocial). Came back about 20 minutes later, still no answer at the door. ""Screw it"" I thought, ""I'm going home"".

Got home, got out of the car... the phone rings ""Where are you? I'm in town, are you coming in or what?"". Oops lol. Picked him up, got a McDonalds, yada yada...played some Pro Evolution Soccer 4, had a good evening.

Dropped him home...(god I'm just listing)...came home, and put Warcraft on for a bit. I have to admit it's getting boring, <lj user=""llanabeth""> was very right, it just holds no long term motivation to log in. I suppose from a MMORPG addict's point of view it's a miracle - I might go back to The Sims 2 or something, that was always fun!

Carly wanted to go clubbing on Monday night. I said I was working...she only wants me to go so she's not by herself, but I know for a fact she's just gonna walk off with some guy eventually and I'll be standing around by myself. No fun at all.

I need to get some photos of everyone for everyone to see. Results day is the perfect opportunity, 18th August. I'm anxious to know how I did.

I'm going to try and get myself back into reading...NOT Harry Potter thank you very much, some of the classics and/or some 20th century stuff. I can't see me making Uni this year but if I do, I'm going to need to read 23 hours a day.

Peter Jennings died...I'm shocked. ABC News won't be the same...who's gonna anchor for them now? :(

Leave me a comment guys if you're reading, I miss my comments :("

"event","I went to bed quite late last night. I've borrowed <i>Fight Night: Round 2</i> from James and damn its a classy game...basically its a boxing simulator, but the depth in it is really good and I was totally hooked. I think I got to sleep about 3AM or so, with the mindset that I'd be up for 10:30AM or thereabouts this morning to get to work at 12.

Instead I woke up around 6:30 in serious pain. My right arm (following the trolley incident) had a shooting pain all down it... I couldn't make a fist or put it into any position without feeling it even worse. I got up (more pain) and looked around for some Nurofen, hell, any type of pain killers that would help ease it off. Searched high and low but couldn't find any. I contemplated jumping in the car to get some so I could at least get back to sleep...but a moment later after giving it some thought I realised I wouldn't be able to steer the car very well, it doesn't have powered steering so the muscles would have to do more work - and consequently the pain was gonna be too much.

So I ended up rolling around in bed trying to find a position that was semi-comfy and I dunno if I was adjusting to the pain but it didn't seem as bad after a while.

With work in mind I sent Gemma (the only manager from work whose mobile number I have) and asked if she had Ant's number (he was the dayshift manager for today)...she text back at 9AM, which woke me up and said that I should just ring him at 11 when he got in.

I rang him at about 11:10, he wasn't very understanding... the guy is a twat - selfish, stressy and he's one of those guys who thinks the world owes him a favour. ""You could have given me more notice!"" - what the hell am I supposed to say? Anyway he didn't care for my explanation of what happened he just wanted to get off the phone. What a twat.

Although the pain has died down the bruising on my arm seems to be getting worse. Bear in mind that the trolley incident was almost a week ago, its weird that its taken so long for the bruising to come up. I've got work tomorrow night (5-11) and I'm contemplating phoning in again because I just don't want the aggro of work at the moment. They're making me work 5 shifts this week without my prior consent and I won't be screwed over without some form of revenge, after tomorrow I'd have 2 days off followed by 5 shifts in a row...sorry guys but I have a social life. (Yes, I know... I just never seem to post about it much in here =P).

So that's been my day pretty much... interspersed with a pinch of Warcraft and a hint of Fight Night.

I'm getting lazy, and I think I've put on a little weight over the last couple of weeks - if only Royal Mail would ring me and say ""You can start tomorrow..."", it would save a lot of hassle at the moment.

PS - I need new icons, any paint shop wizards out there? =P"

Not much to post regarding work... it was a typical close shift.

What I really need to let the world know about is what happened after. I agreed to meet up with Carly and we went to the 24hr McDonalds drive-thru in Brentwood before coming back to Chelmsford. I filled up on diesel in the Esso garage just before Tesco...then we went into Tesco and bought some stuff.

In the car park on the way out... there was this shopping trolley. Jokingly I said ""Well, this is my car..."" but went towards my car instead. Carly said to jump in, I joked and said that would be silly but after some persuasion she got me to stand up in it...

...just as I was getting my balance (remember trolleys have wheels) she pushed the trolley forwards! Cue me falling backwards out of the trolley onto my back on the concrete with my head albeit lightly, hitting the ground as well. I let out some kind of noise as I was in some serious pain, Carly says ""Oh my god are you alright?"" (sounded very concerned). Then before I know it she's telling me to get up and stop being a drama queen about it. WTF??? Not only is she not apologising for it, she's dismissing it as a brush-away incident that is easily forgotten about.

Both my elbows are seriously grazed and my left shin is grazed somehow. Add to that it hurts to move my left hand in any capacity and if i clench my right fist I get a shooting pain up my arm...stop being a drama queen? Fuck off.

She's just sent me a text... <i>""At least ur feeling better than the rabbit i hit on the way back. It scared the living shit outta me. i swear i almost had a heart attack. Jeesus....""</i>

If I'd seen someone fall out of a trolley backwards onto their back I'd be feeling so guilty and wanting to at least make it up to them...not Carly, I'm so angry at the moment. To mark the occasion I've taken some pictures (except of my head as the bump isnt visible).

Well there it is...the last but one picture is actually some sort of blister-like thing with blood in it on my hand and the last one is the graze on my leg. It wasn't coming out very well but it looks worse and it hurts like hell. The first three are elbow pictures.

The pain isn't going away, I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able to sleep.

"event","Well it didn't go too well. There were two parts to it and BOTH had difficult questions... proof if any that A-Levels really aren't getting easier as the media might suggest. I kinda muddled through with half convincing answers on each section. I'm not happy about my performance to be honest but it's one less exam to do now and it'll be nice to get them out of the way.

Went into town with Elaine and Danielle afterwards and we went to Pizza Hut *curses*... nice pizzas in there but their buffet wasn't very appetising. The waitress as well wasn't particularly friendly and didn't deserve tipping in my opinion... to bring the bill over early to ""save time later"" is a mark that the customer should get out once they've finished eating. Not impressed in any case.

Went to the Odeon afterwards, saw <i>Mr & Mrs Smith</i>... it was a good film, quite a unique blend of action/comedy/romance. It worked, yet as with bards in EverQuest, it could be argued to be ""The jack of all trades, master of none"". The big shootout scene at the end before the house blows up is SO unrealistic, spinning around shooting people and shooting people behind you that you didn't turn around and see at all? Well call this a reality check but one bullet to the head and YOU'RE GOING DOWN!!! DOWN DOWN DOWN!! lol.

Came out afterwards, both thought it was alright... Odeon staff for some sickening reason are wearing pink t-shirts. The guys didn't look very upbeat in any case.

Cycled home (always an ordeal for this unfit body) but made it back in one piece. Generally once I've got to the top of New London Road I'm ok it's just a steep bastard that needs conquering.

Right now I'm sat here on my <font size=""3""><b>BROADBAND</font></b> connection wondering how to use the powah of such bandwidth... there should be a shrine dedicated to broadband somewhere - the new Mecca or Jerusalem."

My rate was about 4k/second.

Here it's hovering around 75k/second!!!

That may not sound like much to users with big big connections but to me that's the equivalent of pulling a tramp off the streets and treating him to a 3 course meal! ;p


I'm meant to be revising at the moment but my head was going crazy trying to remember stuff so I'm having a break...I cannot wait to get this exam out of the way, the summer will be here and I'll be able to take full advantage of what little decent weather we get here. Its well sunny and warm outside at the moment but I can't be out there because of this law exam - I really want to be sitting in the park or something (preferably with someone else so as not to look like a billy no mates) and just be relaxing and vaguely attempting a tan ;p

People will walk down the street and say...

""My my, what a lovely shade of burn you're wearing!!"" and I'll thank them heartily ;p

Still annoyed about England last night, according to various people around college, some French cars (Renault for example) on the streets got trashed last night and the police couldn't control all the violence =O ...but it's justified, this is FOOTBALL we're talking about, and the old English vs French thing goes back centuries - *spit*

Ok, well back to revision I guess...but I really don't want to be shut in a room while its so sunny outside :("

Trying to revise in between but i'm too gripped...and with the exam only a couple of days away I'm not sure if its gonna be better for me to revise one unit thoroughly and bank on the resit in January for the other (more difficult) one.

Come on England! ;)

"event","Last night was quite interesting, despite my grit and determination to revise until the cows came home I got a text from Vicky saying Dan was going down to the pub, did I wanna go along?

I said yes, I needed a break but decided to take my revision folder with me anyway just in case.

Had a few games of pool and a chat with everyone, Shel was there too somehow - normally if I don't pick her up she doesn't make it up there from South Woodham.

Dropped Shel home at about 11:45ish - but we sat outside talking for a while. It was a few minutes at first but it soon turned into longer...I've learnt a lot of stuff about her that I never knew before, and I can sort of work out why she's so depressed sometimes.

After a couple of <b>hours</b> of chatting about each other's lives we went all the way back to Chelmsford and picked up some cigarettes (for her) and some food - and went all the way back to South Woodham and sat talking for a bit longer...both of us were well tired though.

She went in about 5am, and I came home...I haven't stayed up that late in a long time, didn't get to sleep until 6am or so and consequentially didn't get up until around 2pm =O...nasty!

Spent a bit of time revising today but the old concentration thing again, I just can't seem to stick with it :("

In the meantime I went into college and did a good 2 hours revision, then went into town and bought myself an early reward present for getting myself through the exams...<i>Pro Evolution Soccer 3!!</i>

Went over to Tom's, watched a DVD, came back here and went over to Hylands Park and played football for a bit. Suddenly it was 6:30, dropped him home and came back here - now gonna do some revision I think, though the game is oh so tempting."

Went over to Hylands Park in the end and did an ickle bit of revision over there - not nearly enough though and only on a small topic of one area of a unit, a metaphorical drop in the ocean of what is to be a large exam :(

I'm so fired up though, I'm going to get a pair of A's if it kills me, I've never wanted to do so well in an exam so badly - and if I sat it right now I'd be lucky to hit a C so gotta get lots of work done."

Not getting much law work done today anyway, I'm hungry and the refectory is closed so I'm going to go home and make something to eat and head out to Hylands Park and try and revise there perhaps.

In other news, RoninMUD doesn't seem to be working anymore...went and had a look last night and thought I'd maybe log back in and see if I could push my character up a few levels but it won't connect! :(

I guess with many more modern games like EverQuest and tons of others they've become very outdated and hugely underplayed...t'is a shame.

I'm hungry, really hungry...haven't eaten anything today. Not good."

"event","I feel very yucky still.

Went into town to get some money out, the bastards at Nat West have stopped me using my card for some reason so had to go in and they ordered me ANOTHER card...so another week of messing about not being able to get cash out of machines cometh.

Against my better judgement I'm going to the pub tonight with Vicky and her friend, and interestingly Dan is ill and Aaron isn't replying to the text I sent him so I'm not sure if something is going on as it'll be just us three...apparently. That means I'll be paying for all the drinks, they rarely put anything in themselves, dont think either of them is working at the moment so figures.

Don't think I'm going to drink anything other than coke tonight, not feeling particularly well.

Went up to Tesco after getting my money out and got some food n stuffs, I'm not sure if it's me feeling baking hot or the weather generally but it made me feel worse...I'm going to take a shower and see if that helps some.

Oooh, and incidentally...that poll I set up was just to see who on my friends list still reads, only six people by the look of it but they're all journals I read regularly so that's not so bad - thanks for doing it those that did :)"

"event","Just got back from Carly's sleepover - I'm not sure if I mentioned it in a previous entry or not but anyway, had a really good time and got lots of pictures to put up at some point.

The big mistake however was mixing my drinks, started off with a mahusive sized Stella Artois bottle, then went on and started drinking vodka...ick.

The result was probably quite predictable, I was notably lethargic as everyone else went outside to look around Carly's place (its massive, they've got horses and stuff) and threw up once out there before going back in and lying down for a while.

Joined back in with everyone after 30 minutes but still, wasn't feeling too good. The evening was cool, but around midnight although I didn't have any more to drink after being sick the first time I ran outside to be sick again, and hurled up lots. Felt instantly better though ;)

Charlotte said at one point ""you're looking very green"" and though I'm not going to put the photo up there's one of me looking literally green faced. Never mixing my drinks again that's for sure.

We watched <i>The Shining</i>, the Jack Nicholson version and then a few episodes of South Park before trying to get some sleep.

I couldn't get comfy for most of the night and have slept probably 2-3 hours at most...not feeling too great this morning surprisingly ;(

Gotta do some revision today, only got today and Sunday before the exams where I'm not working and got the opportunity. Ugh."

"event","Dammit, missed Big Brother and the final episode of Friends earlier due to being at work :(

Also, close to the end of my shift I got pulled over by the Police for:----

1. Speeding (40 in a 30 zone)
2. Not wearing a seatbelt.
3. (apparently) Almost hitting a van on turning a corner.

Just as I was being told all of the above (I put my seatbelt on as they stopped me...they saw though!), they got called a way to a much more important incident!!

HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAHA!!!!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHHAHHA!!!!

Damn I was lucky!"

"event","Psychology exam is tomorrow, I'm going to go in there and do my best...but dammit, I should have been revising at least from a couple of months ago, cram though I might I'm not going to remember the level of detail needed to get a good grade. Dammit!

Was speaking to Yvonne (Ronni) today, she tells me the problems she has with her ex. I borrowed her phone to have a game of snake and there's this message in there from him saying...

<b>If we do go back out I'd better get some sex.</b>

What the fuck??? The guy is seriously creepy anyway and he hates me for some bizarre reason, but I kept my mouth shut as she said not to look through her messages (which is ironically what made me have a quick filter through, bad of me I know).

Revised half of 1 unit today and that took me a few hours, I've got to sit 6 units tomorrow (4 and then the 2 I messed up back in January)...I'm dead :("

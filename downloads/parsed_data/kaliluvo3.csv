"event","this is kinda lame, but this is the only way to let out my thoughts, so here it goes.....

i'm trying to be strong, not be affected by everything thats happened the last week, but the truth is, is that IT KILLS ME.....it makes me question everything, life, love, guys, relationships, the thought that everthing happens for a reason. but the worst thing about it is that it makes me question myself. like i can't help but blame myself for everthing, blame myself for pushing him away, for not dealing with my problems before going into another relationship. nothing i do will bring back my life, the sense of normalcy that i'm DYING to get back. i don't want him back, i don't want a pity party, i just want to be able to relax for just one second without my mind drifting off, thinking about him. why is it sooo hard, why does it have to hurt SOOO MUCH.... i can't stand how i am right now, i keep writing it down, letting all my feelings out in a desperate attempt to get it out of my system, out of my mind. like maybe if i keep talking about it, letting it all out, maybe i won't have to think about it anymore. is that completely crazy or what? 

the really psychotic thing about it is, is that when i'm not with him, its ok, you know? i don't look for him, i don't need him. but when i see him, i get that feeling all over again and i'm weak an vulnerable. it's makes miss him and feel sorry for myself and thats the worst possible thing i could do. and i hate myself for acting like this, like a pathetic girl that thinks she needs a stupid boy to make me happy....and i don't, i really don't...i have amazing friends that love me so much and people that support me, who the fuck needs stupid boyfriends???? 

i feel like a part of me has died, you know? like everthing i've thought about, everything i've come to school for in the morning, thought about when i woke up, went to sleep dreaming about, cried over, laughed over, loved, dreamed, wished for, lived for, has just died, vanished, gone. it was all a lie, it meant nothing, it was just a way for him to keep me happy to get what he wants. he didn't love me, didn't see me for who i was, didn't want to try, appeased me. it was an infatuation, a physical attraction. it kills me to say that but its true. you think you know yourself and yourself with someone else, but you really really don't.........


god, i'm a mess.....i miss him so much......make me stop.....


I woke up today 
Woke up wide awake 
In an empty bed 
Staring at an empty room 
I have myself to blame 
For the state I'm in today 
And now dying 
Doesn't seem so cruel 
And oh, I don't know what to say 
And I don't know anyway 
Anymore 

I hate myself for losing you 
I'm seeing it all so clear 
I hate myself for losing you 
What do you do when you look in the mirror 
And staring at you is why he's not here? 

You got what you deserved 
Hope you're happy now 
'Cause everytime I think of her with you 
It's killing me 
Inside, and 
Now I dread each day 
Knowing that I can't be saved 
From the loneliness 
Of living without you 
And, oh 
I don't know what to do 
Not sure that I'll pull through 
I wish you knew 

I hate myself for losing you 
I'm seeing it all so clear 
I hate myself for losing you 
What do you do when you look in the mirror 
And staring at you is why he's not here? 

I hate myself for losing you 
And oh, I don't know what to do 
I wish you knew 
And oh, I don't know what to say 
And I don't know anyway 
Anymore 
No, no 

I hate myself for losing you 
(I'm seeing it all so clear) 
I'm seeing it all so clear 
I hate myself for losing you 
What do you do when you look in the mirror 
And staring at you is why he's not here? 
What do you say when everything's said? 
Is the reason why he left you in the end? 
How do you cry when every tear you shed 
Won't ever bring him back again? 
I hate myself for loving you

I'm thinking i have no idea who you are cuz i totally didn't recognize him and in a class of 36 i think i would remember everyone, but i didn't wanna say that then so i went to his myspace and decided to look around for a name or something and everyone was calling him brian. i was like no way can this be him, then i see a picture and i was like this has to be him! it was freakin BRIAN HENDERSON! the guy i liked in like the 2nd grade and then he moved. so i responded and he was like wow i didn't think you'd remember me. we ended up talking for like hours until my mom made me go to sleep at 3 in the morning, but it was so awesome talking to him after like 9 years.....so thats my story...."

"event","ok so since i've abandoned this thing for a while now, i felt bad and decided to post again....life's been.....unbearably boring. everyone says summer's supposed to be like 2 months of parties and the beach and craziness, but it's totally been a bummer so far. the highlight of my break was my cousin getting married and i got to hang out with my cousins which was so freakin awesome!!! but then less than a week later my cousin's grandma died and it was so unbearably sad. but its ok cuz she isn't in pain anymore. i spent alot of time with my cousins tho, which was freakin awesome, and i also hung out with ryzzy, knyxy, and carlo which was great. then we had that crazy fourth of july at my aunt's house. my cousin passed around the wine bottle, and it's all history from there. that was so much freakin fun...i mean come on...getting drunk with the people you grew up with?!?! what is greater than that....nothing is better than that. well, lately i've been looking for a job, but i haven't gotten one yet.....so im at home watching tv, eating, and getting fat. so seriously, if ANYONE wants to chill, totally call me, cuz i can promise you well do something, and trust me, i'm so bored, i'll do anything!
Do you have certain aspects of you life that you totally regret? like i was thinking about it, there are so many things that i wish i did, so many people i just let slip through my fingers. like how i wish i had the courage to ask Garrett to hang out, and now i'll never see him again. or how that one one party how i wish i made out with this one guy, and now he's gone forever. i even wish that i acted on my feelings when this other guy that liked me and taken our relationship further. i just wish...that things were different, i wish i had the courage to do the things i wanted to do. i wish i could turn back time and listen to my heart, and done the things i wanted to do and maybe things would be different, maybe things would've been...better."

"event","This is for all my wonderful guy friends that have no clue what their doing....
1. Whatever you do, don't just show up at their house...they run around in their underwear just like we do.

2. Don't cheat on them. It may seem foolproof, but girls tell each other everything about everything. Trust me, they WILL find out and you will be mud.

3. Beware of every single male relatives and all guy friends. Any of them would kick your butt at the drop of a hat, and a lot of them wouldn't even wait for the damn hat.

4. Never miss an opportunity to tell them they're beautiful.

5. Don't refuse to kiss in front of your friends. If they laugh at you, it's because they're jealous.

6. If they slap you hard, you deserved it.

7. Don't be afraid to touch them if you want to. If they're going out with you in the first place, it's because they like being in your arms.

8. If you don't sleep with them, do not tell your friends that you did.

--8.5. If you DO sleep with them, don't tell your friends that you did.

9. You can be dirty minded in private, really...most of them are not offended by it...

10. Not all of them eat like birds, a lot of them can eat like whales.

11. Most of them don't mind paying half of everything, but they do discuss these things with their friends. Realize that if you make your girlfriend pay half all the time, everyone will know about it and your friends will know you're a wimp.

--11.5. Do you honestly need all your money that much? Be a man, pay all the time!

12. Every girl should eventually get three things from her boyfriend- a stuffed animal, one of his sweatshirts, and a really pretty ring. Even if it's not a serious relationship.

13. Make sure she gets home safely as often as you can. If you're dropping her off, walk her to the door. If you aren't dropping her off, call to be sure she's home safely.

14. If a guy is bothering her, it is your right to kick the crap out of him.

15. If you're talking to a female friend of yours, pull your girlfriend closer.

16. Never, ever slap her, even if it's just in a joking way. Even if she swats you first, and says, ""Oh, you're so dumb"" or something, never make any gestures back.

17. Go to a chick flick once in a while. She doesn't care whether you enjoy it or not, it just matters that you went.

18. You're dead meat if you can't get along with their pets, parents and best friends. Be prince charming to their friends, Mr. Polite to their parents, and make sure to be nice to their animals.

19. Don't flirt with their moms or friends...that's just freaky.

20. Don't be freaked out by PMS. It's not gross, and it really does make them feel like crap, so be understanding.

21. If you don't like the way they drive, you do it.

22. If you're officially dating, and you're introducing her to your friends, you'd better damn well introduce her as your girlfriend.

23. Don't stress where you go for every date. They really only want to be with you.

24. If they complain that something hurts, kiss it for them without being asked.

25. Girls are fragile. Even if you're play fighting/wrestling, be very gentle.

26. Memorize their birthdays. You forget her birthday and you're basically screwed for life.

27. Don't marinade the cologne.

28. Don't give her something stupid for her birthday or Christmas or Valentine's day. It doesn't have to be expensive, but it has to be meaningful. Jewelry is always nice.

29. If you think the relationship isn't going to last, don't wait to find out. It will only hurt you more if you draw it out.

30. After you've been dating for a while, realize that they really have started to trust you. When you have a girlfriend who truly trusts you, you have a lot more responsibility, privilege and control than you would think. Be careful with it, most guys would kill for that kind of power, and it can be lost in a nanosecond.

31.Don't ever do anything wrong (well not anything), but girls remember things for life and anything you did wrong will be used against you in the future.

"event","this post is a lil delayed, but hey, i've been busy

retreat was very awesome this weekend. i got to meet new people and chill with the people i graduated with up in beautiful Big Bear for 3 whole days!!! what a rush...anyways it was amazing cuz there was sooo much snow and i was beautiful. it was so much fun too, except for the fact that Garrett stuffed snow down my jacket.... in my pockets.....and in my mouth!! what a turd....but he's really awesome . its weird cuz i met him on the bus on the way to Big Bear, but i feel like i've known him forever. He goes to Crespi, he plays the guitar and has the greatest sense of humor. well, besides Garrett, i met katie, G, and a bunch of other great people. and i got to chill with christina and jason, so that was really fun. 

that was the nice part of the retreat, here's the drama...

stuff happened on the retreat and my feeling have totally changed for this person i've been interested in. being with him, i feel like im suffocating, like i can be my own person or live my own life when im around him. and he gets jealous so easy, i don't know what to do. i told him that i want to just be friends, and the entire weekend he totally ignored my request. and on the bus one thing led to another and i did stuff i totally regret now. i feel like im either scared or intimidaed by him, like i don't know how to tell him how i feel without offending him, and i hate this scared anxious feeling i get when im around him, like im waiting to see hows he's gonna react to my every move. on top of this, i met this other guy, who's so completely awesome and i kinda like him and i think he may like me too. he has the greatest personality and sense of humor and being around him puts a smile on my face. im so confused and i  don't know what to do, or how to act. i don't want to lose a potential friend or boyfriend because im scared to lose something that i may not even want. i also don't want to ditch this guy for another one, because i hate being the person that breaks someone's heart for another guy...if you have any advice...tell me por favor...
<3 Gayle

p.s. i am kinda mad at you cuz of what happened on the bus when i told u to stop, but you didn't. why couldn't you just listen to me? i told you i wanted to be friends. i just don't like the fact that you treat me like your property. i'm not even your girfriend yet. i know this is really harsh but i won't see you for along time and i just have to tell you this. we're not together right now, and i dont know if there is a chance anymore that we ever will be. i can't be in a relationship where i can't hang out with other people or have my own life without you feeling hurt or offended. i really don't want to hurt you but i can't lie to you either. i've got alot of things on my mind right now and who knows? maybe even another guy, i just can't be in a relationship with you right now."

i can't believe i got a C in bio!! i almost cried....well i was more angry at myself then anything else, but whatever, im gonna buckle down this semester...haha, what i joke, but really, i think ill concentrate a lil harder, and besides since its an honros class, it counts as a b, so its all good
Anyways.....this week was ok, but a lil stressful. sophmore dance is this coming friday (Feb. 4) and we dont know all of it, but, it'll be great...o ya and all you better come and watch....or else...haha. i pissed someone off on friday, it was actually kind of a relief cuz this person's been pissing me off like all year,....o god tht was really mean, but i hate to admit it, but its true....im so evil, someone slap me before i lose control! jk jk...

Today was...interesting. I had a quiz in english, another make up quiz in yet again english, a report due which i didn't get to my teacher on time so i'm officially...screwed, Spanish honors placement exam, and we had a prayer service. Holy crap i've been so stressed out like this whole break. Well, there were a few good things about my day. I'm pretty sure i aced my makeup quiz, i ono about the one i took today during class, but i know i didn't fail, maybe a B or something. The prayer service was...boring. i sat with aimee, chanelle and paolo. dude, i haven't talked 2 him in a while. actually i haven't really talked 2 him since i stopped liking him...o well whatever. o ya and my friend started to cry during the service and felt really bad for her, but i couldn't really do anything about it. Then the spanish test was freakin hard!! Ahhh!!! i hate school! thank God it's spring break! holy crap if i had to go to school any longer, i'd shoot myself (not literally). Well, during p.e. i had a really good talk with someone who i can actually relate to. it seems as if everyone is trying to avoid the fact that everyone in my old class, as much as i miss all of them, have grown apart. As depressing as it is, it's true. A perfect example is at confirmation class. I mean, i grew up with these people, they know me like the back of their hand, yet we stand around, thinking about something to say to each other because by us going to different schools, we've officailly grown apart. it's amazing that at one point and time these people could tell you what i have for breakfast every morning, it's insane. Well, i can't begin to describe how good it feels to talk to someone who i can relate to, who was once my best friend....i miss that. if you're reading this, i just want you to know that i miss the wonderful friendship we once had and i know it's kind of impossible to get that relationship back, i just want you to know that...

Ok, i have to admit, when you said the things you said, i know that they may or may not have been pointed directly towards me. But after sorting through my thoughts, first being angry with you, then hating you, i realized....you're right. you are so completely right and i can't believe it took me about a million years to figure it out. I can't know that i ""love"" someone after 2 short weeks. By putting my own desires above everything else, i realize that i pushed myself and everone else around me into believing in something that isn't really there. i know that doesn't make much sense, but i finally understand what you have been trying to tell my for the past month now. I've made a horrible mistake and it may or may not have cost me someone whom i may have had the potential to truly love and care for, and to feel the same way in return. i know i blew my chance so far, but i also know that listen to those around you can get you farther than anything else in the world. thanks. you and your advice honestly mean alot to me and i keep beating myself up inside at the thought of my stupidity for the past couple of weeks, and its killing me, but i've learened my lesson, i figured it out..."

"event","Do you know that one friend you had, like while ago? the one you used  to hang out with, talk to about anything and everything, and love like their meant to be with you, to be your best friend, your mentor, your other self? Suddenly that friend disappears from your everyday life, and things seem to be falling apart, but after a while you learn to live with them being away from you, but you know you will never forget them. If you haven't figured it out, i'm talking about tonie, my tonie. I miss her and love her sooo much, it's crazy. I told her things, about my life, my relationships, my loves and i know she's always going to know some of my secrets, stuff i don't want the whole world to know. I just recently found out that she doesn't feel the same way. I haven't talked to her in a while and she feels like i am no longer her true friend, like i disowned her, left her. I have to admit, i'm a lil pissed off, but i have to ask myself, who can blame her? i haven't really made myself as available to her as i should be. I've been so caught up with my new boyfriend, track, and school, that i haven't gotten around to calling tonie 3 times a week to know how she's doing. i guess it's really kinda my fault as well, but the fact that she said that she no longer has the true friends she thought she once had really hurts. i can't believe she thinks that i'm not her true friend, that i'm no as close to her as i was before. I know we have lead completely different lives but that doesn't me that i don't care about her, like i forgot her, that's impossible. Tonie's been a big part of my life. My relationship with tonie isn't exactly something i can't push off to the side, or forget. it's something that's keep with me and remember forever."

Well ya,for all those people who actually care about what im saying right now HE is Devin. Yes! i finally said it, told the public, told everyone, i feel so free! not like anyone cares, but hey, it was worth a shot. Well things have been going so great for me.

I have a boyfriend now guys...ya, i don't sound too excited. But really, i am, and he's such a great guy, but i don't know, i still really like you know who and i wish i were with him instead. I feel like such a terrible person for putting jason through all of this, but i know i have to move on from my man, experience other people. Another thing i remembered, was that today is my, or would have been my 2 year 4 month annieversary with my ex. He even told me so, lol. I'm completely over him, but i don't know what made me remember that, probably him, cuz he's a goofball. He's stil one of my really close friends, which is pretty cool i guess. My man, is still my best friend, he keeps me sane, while i drive him insane, lol, but he still loves me, i know he does cuz he tells me so whenever i start to lose my mind. I was on the phone with him the other night until midnight talking about anything and everything, it was so awesome. I was really close to telling him how i felt about him, but i didn't, no use overwhelming him. i'm so confused, I really miss my mom. Whenever i need adivce or someone to talk to, she's always the one i go to, but she's in Big Bear right now with my sister, so i guess i lucked out. Wow, she sure picked the perfect day to go out of town. I really just don't know, i like jason, but he's not my man...help me someone!"

Well, today was pretty cool. First it's firday the 13th ahhhhh!!! scarwwwy....heeheehee. Well, i went to school, and i saw sydney, cuz she was *sick* lol. and i told her everything thats been going on and stuff like that, and she's really happy for me. Then i went to math, where i fell asleep as usual. I have the worst geometry honors teacher on the face of the planet, its not even funny. So then, after math, i went to my locker, then gave out some valentines, and then i went downstairs with sydney who guess who comes up to me, and tells me that he has something to give me, but it's in his locker! o my goodness gracious, hez a silly poop. but then, he ended up not giving it to me, probably cuz i didn't really see him after that. ok i didn't see him at all after that. He probably either gave it to the girl he told me he likes or someone else or he'll give it to me on tuesday. I don't really know if i'm completely over him though. i mean i know i really should move on, be happy with the new guy in my life, but i'm trying to keep my distance partly because i don't know if i want to get involved with someone right away or not and partly because i'm scared that my old guy might still like me and if he ever gets the courage to tell me, i may not have the strength to say no. Then, i'd be involved with him and thats something i've wanted for the longest time, but i don't want to just dump this new guy, i mean he's already told me how much he likes and he just got dumped by his ex like 3 weeks ago and isn't completely over it, and i can't break his heart all over again, not this soon. I'm confused and i don't know who to choose!!! but i really like my old guy, but i'm starting to really like my new guy too, and i don't know what to do..."

Alot of things have happened and i don't know if im ready to deal with it, but i guess thats not an option, huh? first of all, Tonie's gone, and of course i talk to her on the fone and stuff, but its not the same as seeing her everyday. She seems to be the only person i can really talk to who won't judge me on everything i say or do. haha, tonie, ur probably reading this right now, but itz all true. Second, winter formal has gotten everyone acting freaky, including me. i asked him and he told me that he thinks going with a date equals a bad time, so to me, that translates to i don't want to go with you, you ugly desperate bitch. okay, i know he doesn't think of me in that way cuz he told me he didn't, but still, i'm kinda wishing for a miracle here and i can't seem to move on, or go forward, im in neutral. Third, i joined track, which now, is going so well for me and i love it, but at first, i was ready to kill myself, and so was my coach. she kinda got sick of me always having to leave early becuase of asthma and stuff, but i'm okay now. I also have had alot on mind lately. Not really stuff i wanna tell the entire world, but just stuff. some of it is small, trivial, and not reaslly that important, and some of it is stuff that really gets to me. i was talking to devin the other day and i was just really stressed out and tried. he helped me figure out what my problem is. He told me that i let too much shit get to me. At first i was like wtf?! but then i was like, holy crap thats true! So ya, im trying to take is easy and not let so much of the bad shit in the world to get to me. Thanks, Devin!

So i was in the emergency last nite cuz i had this really bad asthma attack and i was at the hospital and they gave me all these steroids to control my asthma and they had to give me a treatment, and it was really scary. i really wanted to call him last night cuz i was really scared and needed someone to talk to, but i couldn't cuz i was in the hospital and they get mad at you if you use a cellphone, so i didn't. Then i got home really late and i had to study for my science final, which by the way, was really easy. So then i wrote him a note and i was telling myself in am going to give it to him! but of course, i didn't i'll give it to him b4 i leave, no worries. So then i didn't have a semester vocab quiz, i'm really grateful for that. Then i was really worried cuz i had to do my mile run for gym, but then i talked to coach and she told me not to run cuz if i did, i would have gotten another asthma attack or collapsed, or even worse...both! i don't want to think about that, cuz it scares the shit out of me, but i guess im okk now. i'm on steroids for asthma for the next 4 days and they make me really lightheaded and i start to shake, but i've been on this medication b4, so i should be used to it, but i'm not. it freaks me out every single time im on it, but no worries, i just have to take them i guess. ok, i'm gonna go now cuz i just rambled on about my steroids."

Now, for me, i learn to accept that. but once you do that to someone else who can't seem to take that, you leave them hangin and you totally hurt their feelings. can't people understand, when you are friends with someone, leaving them for one little fight is the worst thing you can do when that person cares about you as a friend sooo much. i just believe in second chances, no matter how much you screwed up the first time. and for my other firends, i just want everyone to know that im am here 24/7 for ANYONE no matter who you are. no one deserves to be going through the torture some people put on the alone."

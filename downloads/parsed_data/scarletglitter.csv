I met a guy today named Mark. He's really cool and nice, and I think he's just great. He and I share some ideas and stuff. I'm really tired now so yeah. I seem really disjointed when I type right now. I'm just happy I've met him. It was fun. So yeah.
A funny thing is that I now, yet again, have a crush on Jesse McCartney again. I think it's cuz I can relate with some of his material. And, I'm partial to blondes. So yeah. It's sorta annoying ya know. Cuz you fall in love with people you just can't have or don't like you. I just hate it.
But, as I've said on MySpace, I've given up on the game of love for a while. Maybe I'll find someone once I quit completely. Being a constant hopeless romantic is just like cigarettes, so addictive you have to ween yourself of it. Anyway. I've commited myself to fantasy and fiction for probably the next year. It's a good escape from the world of guys I can't have and want.
So anyway. Uhhhh...
Yeah. I'll write later when I'm not so ADD-ish.

My most recent is of a man who kills himself and it becomes a murder case involving all the people around him. It's kinda odd but I'll make sense later.
Gotta go. ttyl.

Thaxy: You were the one who'd never leave
Me: Beautiful eyes, you seemed so free
    Touching your face I felt complete
Thaxy: Holding your hand my heart would weep

Me: So everything that came out of your mouth was full of lies
    You looked me right dead in the eyes
Thaxy: You'd call your girlfriends and tell them that I abused your trust
       You did your best to demonize

(Chorus is same as before.)
You were the one who'd never leave
Beautiful eyes, you seemed so free
Touching your face I felt complete
Holding your hand my heart would weep

Me: You were the one who raped my soul
    Beautiful lies, you stole my hope
    Touching your ass, I scratch the skin
    Holding your neck, I tie the rope...
   (Pulling it tight)

You were the one who'd never leave
Beautiful eyes, you seemed so free
Touching your face I felt complete
Holding your hand my heart would weep

Me: You were the one, the one for me
    Now that you're gone it's hard to see
    So much of me has gone away
    There's no need to stay another day
    (But someone's got to pay)

Okay so most of it was me, but there were some lines I thought Thaxy should sing. Anyway. Not much new here. See yall."

The insanely sad thing is my boyfriend isn't standing up for me and most of my friends who dissed me were his best friends. He said, ""They probably didn't want to offend me bcuz ur my girlfriend."" He should have been offended in the first place. and now it's harder to get in touch with Derek than the fucking pope. I'm on leave from school for emotional issues and he doesn't even care that I wanna talk to him. It's really sad. Anyway. Maybe I should try him again.

Lots are happening to me. I have a horrible case of head lice and it's driving me insane. I didn't get enough sleep the first night I knew I had them. I have to sleep in our guest room and it's hard sleeping on that bed somehow. Derek pretty left on a trip without telling me it was confirmed to happen. I found out from his brother. And he doesn't seem to care that I have lice and it's killing. Of course, I guess he doesn't know, but it's annoying me that he probably doesn't and won't care.
I don't mean to sound like the clingy girlfriend; look at all aspects of our relationship before judging me. Maybe I am, but Derek doesn't seem to want to tell me the truth if I am.
Anyway. I'm going to orientation for early college classes on Monday and probably starting my class on Tuesday. I'm hoping to have a sleepover with my best friend(locally) and then going to a fair with her, her boyfriend, and Derek(as well as both his and my friends family) at the end of this week.

I just noticed that most of my new story ideas have to do with suicide. My most recent idea being about a girl who commits suicide while her boyfriend(who loves her very much) is on vacation and all she left behind is a poem. She was a poet and so her boyfriend tries to decifer what it means and finds out unknown things about his girlfriend. That's my recent idea. I think it'll be something of a vingette(short novel). Oh well. Check out any crap I write on Fictionpress.com under Scarlet DeGondea. Please review my work. I don't care if it's a flame or not. Anything works.
I love the movie Brave New Girl. The music rocks on it. Anyway.
A song that makes me really happy now is Tidal Wave by Skye Sweetnam. I've been acting weird and that song has always picked me up when I'm down.
Oh, BTW, check out Thorvald Umberland on FP.com cuz that's Derek and he rocks. Naturally.

Not much has happened since.....what was is? Thursday? Anyway. I went shopping with Derek and his family yesterday. It rocked. My parents were out all day and said I could spend time with him. When I got home, I saw a Eurovan in the driveway. It rocks my socks off. I spent half-the-day cleaning most of it.
Anyway. ttyl.

"event","Heyla Peeps. Two days of sun so far! *brightens up and starts to dance around* Thank you god! My day is most likely going to rock. Now, if you could only discard a viral cold.*blahk* I sound absolutely horrible and my throat hurt. I started coughing in the hall this morning and my brother's friend's mom(who is a long term sub) asked me if I was alright. She was walking out of the library and I was walking in.
Anyway. One day late. HAPPY FIVE MONTHS!!!!!!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!!!!!!
No school tomorrow because of Graduation. Yay!
Oh, if Caleb sees this before I talk to him next, Happy Four Months, dude!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh, and if Ammie and Caleb see this anytime soon, e-mail me. I've got something to ask you and junk so I want you to let me know you saw this. Caleb's heard of it but I just gotta hear somethings from you guys and inform you. Anyway. Felt like writing it.
Anyway. I'm in school and cannot think of much else to say. ttyl.

Peace,

"event","Heyla. Sup peeps. It is Friday May 27 2005, and the weather has been gloomy forever. Almost all month. I've been depressed and all that during the month of May. I think it's because of the weather. I hope it ends soon.
Anyway. Prom rocked! Everything was awsome that night.
Also, I'm trying to create a soundtrack for myself, Star Glitter, and Celestina Whifarie, my D+D character. They are still in progress. I'm just into music now.
Also, I'm gonna be working on a story at Upward Bound. It's called Ignite about a suicidal pyromaniac named Darsi Bell, who tries to kill herself by flame, but lives and learns how great life really is. This idea came out of nowhere while I was lying on my mom's bed. I'm on the second chapter but I'm copying the story into another notebook so I can write it in one place at UB. I think I'll work on a soundtrack for it so I can listen to the music while I write.
Yay! Plans are so much fun. I can't wait for UB. It's gonna rock.
Just in case I don't get back to my journal before this, five months Wednesday. *grins* Yay!
It's almost the end of school. Yay and nay! Make-up work!*fades* Vacation and UB *grins and brightens up* End of the year stress. Oh well, it'll be over soon.
Anyway. I'm in school and it's almost time to change class. Seeya'll later.

Peace Out,

"event","TONIGHT IS PROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rock on! I'm so excited. I'm gonna look sorta like a darker form of Cinderella and it's gonna rock hard. I'm getting a ride from my friend Julie and we're picking up Derek and taking him with us.
I was kinda upset yesterday because I had to miss D+D. I had to go shopping for prom stuffins. I found out this morning that I was sorta forgotten about so oh well. I can't wait for the next meeting.
I'm finally up on the internet. YAY. It's like the first time in 3 weeks. Last time I was on, I didn't update. I forgot about it.
Anyway. I got accepted to Upward Bound so I'm thrilled. I can't wait. It'll be so much fun.
I can't think of much more to report so I'll talk to yas later.

"event","Heyla! Sup ya'll?
I got sick and was out of school for 2 days. I haven't taken anyway days off of school this year. It was boring as all. Both of my best friends told me never to miss school again, because it was boring without me. That was the most interesting thing to happen to me all week. Tuesday I was over Derek's house before the Ice Cream Social concert I had to be at. That also happened.
Tomorrow is Easter! Yay!!!!!!!!!!! Candy all around! Gotta love the holiday. It caught most of my friends off guard though. I think it's because it's usually in April. Anyway.
I have new theme song. I consider it my theme song anyway. Beautiful Dreamer by Stephen Foster. Derek was singing part of it to me, because that is my D+D nickname of which he chose for me. So, I've adpoted it as my theme song. Anyway.

Anyway. I am stuck after school everyday this week. Destination Imagination regional competions are this Saturday. We're having practice almost everyday now. Atleast I get to stay for play practice on top of that.(: It's funny to watch/listen to the lines in this play. ""Darling, I think I can handle the deranged man with a fork."" It's just awsome.

Anyway. That's all I can think to say right now. ttyl. seeyas.

I hope to have my website up soon. I've been working on it for a while. It's gonna have writing, art, D+D stuffins, my fandom(stuff I'm a fan of(mostly actors and characters)), links and junk, and song stuffins I have. I can't wait to get it up. It'll be awsome.
Well, the last two day's I've had no school whatsoever. Snow days. *Ugh* I wanted to go with Derek to a dance today. I think he was looking forward to it too.(If you read this Derek, I really don't know which you wanted more.)
Anyway. I can't think of much more to say. I'll update this whole thing later anyway.(Like in a few days.)

P.S: Here is a few lines from a song that reminds me of Derek.

*When I feel like a freak,
The words you say,
Tell me to believe that I'm okay,
When I don't make sense cause I'm this way,
You see the best in me,*

"event","Heyla! I am Scarlet Glitter if you haven't already figured that out. To find out more about me, check my stats.

Well, Christmas just passed. I celebrate that holiday.(no offense to those who celebrate differently.) I got ""South Park-Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" for one. It has to be the most screwed up movie I've seen in my entire life. But, it's the funniest thing in the world. It's cool how those stories work out. And Kenny is just the cutest thing. *aaawwwwww* People might think I'm weird for thinking that show makes sense most of the time but it does. Gotta love Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They've got some really screwed up minds, but they're awsome. I'm still expecting presents, too. I just love it. But anyway.

Nothing really has happened since then. Just watching ""South Park"", ""Big Fish"", and ""Oliver and Co."".
*I'm thuper, thanks for asking,* *What would Brian Brontono Do if he were here today, I'm sure he'd kick an a$$ or two, that's what Brian Brontono'd do!* *There's the girl that I like*
Yes all these songs were from ""South Park"", but most of them are stuck in my head. I especially love, ""Wendy's Song""(poor Stan), but that Brian Brontono song is in my head most of the time, or ""I'm Super"".

Anyway, I will retire now. Til next time. Adios Amigos!

Peace and Love!

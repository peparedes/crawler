Thursday: Lansing to Detroit

Tuesday: Detroit to Lansing


The trip to GR was to hit the bars with the other Central Elementary interns.  We had a blasty blast.  Although when the night ended, I had been bitten by a Great Dane and somebody pissed on my coat.  The Great Dane bite is looking fierce right now too.  I'll try and post pics sometime.

Now back to teaching tomorrow.  Yay for 4 day weekends!  Happy Birthday George and Abe."

I've never had a valentine before.  And on V-Day, I was having a shitty day.  I hadn't slept, was exhausted from the festivities at school, and had to come to my lame job to finish out my 14 hour day.  I came home at 10 feeling shitty and I sad that I couldn't even see Andy on Valentine's Day.  Then I walked in the door and there was a vase of flowers with a sweet note.  The bottom of the note said ""I just pulled in your driveway"" and sure enough, there he was.  I'm a lucky girl. :)


Sorry for the mush!!  This week has been MADNESS.  Valentine's party at the school on Tuesday, 100's day today and all while trying to start my lead teaching!!  It's been nuts.  I am exhausted.  Thank goodness I have a 4 day weekend.

PS - We celebrated 100's day at my elementary, but none of the other interns had ever heard of this being celebrated.  I remember our principal came around dressed as ""Zero the Hero.""  He even had a cape."

"event","My weekend was pretty awesome.

I took Friday off, my first day off of the elementary since I started in September.  And I HATED missing a day too!!  But we woke up early to make the 4 hour trek up to the Ski Haus.  We then enjoyed some skiing at Boyne Highlands with Andy's work buddies.  The weekend was pretty much filled with lots of drinking and skiing.  Isn't that how Sony Bono died?  You can actually, for free, get these warming huts on the ski hill.  Like RIGHT on the ski hill.  They had barbecues so we had a chef/co-worker of Andy's make us delicious brats and burgers which we washed down with lots of beers.

However, it snowed like a mofo on Saturday night.  This meant that our trip back was less than fun.  It took us 6 hours and the highway was CLOSED down up in Grayling/Gaylord area.  Lucky we had the GPS I got Andy for Xmas that helped lead us in the right direction.

Then we hooked up with the same people to attend a fully catered fully beered Super Bowl party.  Andy and I bought a few dollar squares and we both won!!  I won at the end of the game and Andy won at the end of the 3rd.  Fifty bucks richer.  Go us.

My lead teaching begins next Monday and I'm busy as a whore planning these units.  I get to teach poetry.  I always remembered hating poetry, but I think that was just when I was older.  Kids LOVE it.  Lucky for me. :)"

"event","Makes me go nuts.  As in Apple computers.  This past week my Ipod died and I spent hours going to the Apple store in Novi, attempting to fix it myself, beating it with my fist, but nothing seemed to work.  So I brought it to the store again and this time they told me it was ""dead"".  So I got a brand new one for free since I was under warranty.  After some hardwork again, it finally seems to be working with my computer.  Let's see how long it takes to add over 3000 songs to it.  I'm on about song 150 so far. :)

Last weekend and Andy's Holiday Work Party were a blast.  I was the DD for 6 guys on Friday and this meant it was my turn to get ridiculously drunk on Saturday.  And ridiculously drunk I did get.  We went back to Andy's apartment and his roommate Dave was having a new lady friend over for the first time.  Apparently I was pretty beligerent and they had to hide me upstairs before she got there.  Not that I remember any of this.

Nothing much happening this week, except for below which kept Kerri and I occupied at work for literally hours on Tuesday night.  We got about 50.

On Monday we introduced the Core Democratic Value of diversity to our 2nd graders.  We talked about it for awhile, then on Tuesday I had them draw a picture to show how they appreciate diversity.  Some of them drew me teaching them Spanish, some drew themselves eating Chinese or Thai food, and others showed them visiting other countries.

And then there was precious little Joe (the name has been changed to protect him).  Joe drew a picture of one boy saying to a ""black"" boy ""I don't like you, you're black"" and then another boy saying ""Hey leave him alone!""  He labeled the picture ""I'm helping a black kid.""  

I'm not sure what you do with that."

What have I accomplished over break?

Absolutely nothing.  Go me.

On New Year's Eve Andy got a call from his friend Justin.  He was in town (Lansing) all the way from the land of Germany.  He's in the Air Force and kind of sporadically came home.  After I bought a $250 pair of hiking boots for $10, Andy and I made our way back to my part of town for some festivities.  We went to the Moose's for some pre-drinking and watched the ball drop.  Then we made our way to Damon's and partied and drank for free until 2 in the morning.

Oh yes, and also, I was hammered by night's end.  

On Sunday Andy and I shopped and then had a marathon of the Showtime show, Penn and Teller's Bullshit.  This is a great show.  The quote for the series is ""What 60 Minutes might be like if it were run by the creators of South Park.""  I really can't describe it better.

Go rent it.  In fact, I'm gonna watch some now.  Enjoy a few pictures from the festivities!

"event","Work this week has been painfully slow.  It's weird working an 8 hour day and receiving maybe 2 calls my entire shift.  I have a lot I could be doing for school and prepping for next semester.  So what am I doing?  That's right, updating my live journal, reading my hockey forum, reading hockey news, reading CNN news, reading celebrity news, watching DVD's and eating.  God I'm a lazy fuck.

So New Year's is around the bend, and Andy and I have no real plans as of yet.  Is it just me or is nobody really doing anything this year?  It always seems like in years past I knew what I was doing weeks prior to the event.  This year everyone is gone or doesn't really know what their doing.  Oh well.  I'll have a great boy to kiss at the ball drop and I suppose that's most important. :)

My 6 day vacation was fantastic.  Chicago was wonderful.  I took Andy ice skating at the park there since he'd never been before.  I swear he was a better ice skater than me!!  We then ate at my favorite Mexican place and made a trip out to the famous jazz venue, the Green Mill.  It was a great time, and it was swing night so we watched old people dance.  Too cute!!  Andy's not much of a dancer, and an old man called us out.  I'll have to teach him what little swing I know sometime.

And then the next night there was the hockey game.  It pains me to rewrite the experience, but here goes.  Wings played like crap for 57 minutes and Blackhawks were up 2-0.  Andy and I were worried about catching a cab, picking up our bags, and making it to the train on time, so we decided to head out.  I even said ""I've never left a game early before.""  That sealed our fate.  The Wings scored 2 goals in the last 37 seconds to tie it up and head to overtime.  Then Datsyuk scored at literally the last second of OT for the Wings win.  Andy is still pouting about it.  I will NEVER leave a game early again, even if I have a train to catch, work to get to, or if I've been shot and am bleeding profusely.  NEVER again.

Christmas was grand as well, and I seriously think I've managed to pack on 5-10 pounds in the past month.  Good thing I don't weigh myself, otherwise I might be more upset about the situation.  

Someone brought cookies in.  Time to go eat some."

At the elementary school the kids pick if they want cha cha cha's or scooby doo's.  I'd never heard of this before but apparently you go ""Happy Birthday to you cha cha cha"" etc.  We had our ""Holiday"" party at the school today.  Not a Christmas party.  Those are illegal.  Apparently the principal dressed up like Santa a few years back and this really pissed off the Jewish people, so we have to be careful about what we do around the holidays.  No angels, Santas, Christmas trees, etc.  We did a reindeer and a wreath for art projects and that was pushing it.  

Only one day left at the elementary then Andy and I are hightailing it out of here on Wednesday for some fun filled Chicago days and nights.  I'm super psyched.  We're going to see a Red Wings/Blackhawks game, shop, eat good food, etc.  Speaking of shopping, fuck me, only 6 days left to shop.  I got started this weekend and now only have 6 people left to shop for.  I've gotta get crackin'!

I'm going to go out for the KJ's bday tonight, and I'm gonna try and stay out late.  Like, past MIDNIGHT late.  I'm such a rebel."

Although I did feel a special kind of pride after finishing it.  The next day my arms and back felt a different, more painful kind of ""pride"".

When I came to work today, I was waiting to get on the elevator.  This man, pry like 40, walked around the corner but then just stopped and stood there.  I kind of glanced at him and he kept standing there.  Then he walked over to me and said, ""You know, pretty girls should smile.""  Then he walked away.  W.T.F.

So over the weekend I got to see Mrs. Lisa Whitton.  She's 7 and half months pregnant, although you'd never know by looking at her!  Seriously.  I look more pregnant after a night of drinking and gorging.  She's gained like, 15 pounds so far.  That's nuthin'.  I bet she'll only gain 20ish pounds by the time the baby comes, and of course lose half of that when the baby comes.  That skinny bitch.

I also got to see Mr. Andrew Davies over the weekend.  :)  On Friday, I got drunk and he took care of me.  Then on Saturday we reversed roles.  We work well together like that."

I think the lady left the foils on a bit too long.  Seriously.  My hair is like white/yellow.  I'm not freaking out.  Yet.  I'm just hoping they'll chill out a bit after a few washes???  I don't know, this has never happened to me before.  Gah.


In other news, Chicago last weekend was fantastic.  The highlight of the weekend?  On Friday we went to a little dive bar that got a bit crowded as the night went on.  There was a dance floor and people were dancing away.  Then the song ""Hot in Herrrre"" by Nelly came on.  Then a man took off all of his clothes.  No seriously.  Neked.  Danielle pointed, I looked and saw ass cheeks.  He was just standing there like it was no big deal, kind of bopping to the beat.  It was hilarious and yet creepy all at the same time.  On Saturday we watched DANE host SNL.  He was terrific, of course, because he is the M-A-N.  I'm excited because in 2 weeks I get to return to the windy city, but this time WITH an Andy in tote.  We are taking a mini-vacation there for some shopping just before X-mas and to catch the Red Wings/Blackhawks game.  Yay!

Also, it's supposed to snow like a bitch tonight.  I don't want to jinx myself but . . . maybe a snow day is in the works and I won't have to report to the elementary tomorrow???

"event","What did I do this weekend?  I'm pretty sure I can name that tune in 4 words.

Drive.  Eat.  Nap.  Drink.  

Yup, I pretty much cycled those four things for the entire weekend.  And it was fantastic.

I drove to D-town on Wednesday and it was shitty.  Reminds me of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving last year when THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED.  Thankfully, I made it safely to Andy's even though it took almost 3 hours.  We then trekked to his friend's place/party where I drank a pint of vodka and then some.  That's about as much as I can tell you about that night because I don't remember the last half of it.  Leaving, going home, being home, going to bed, etc.  Oops. 

We then traveled to East Lansing, napped, and drove to Caledonia to feast with the family.  Speaking of Caledonia, GO SCOTS HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL DIVISION 3 CHAMPS WOOO.  Dinner was lovely as usual and I think Andy got along well with the family.  Yay.

Andy proved he's the best on Friday by accompanying me and 5 other girls to try on bridesmaid dresses.  He was a trooper.  Then we went out to the bar in the evening to celebrate Liz's Bday.  I saw some old Caledonia people, so that's always fun.  Thankfully, I drank, but still remember the events of the evening.  Go me.

Saturday we drove back to D-town.  We killed about 3 hours at the mall Andy lives by.  We ate and had a contest whilst eating.  Who could spot more ugly ridiculous boots was the name of the game.  Andy kicked my ass.  Seriously, I'm still disturbed by how many ugly furry big ridiculous boots we counted that day.  At least 100.  We then went out with his friends and I got to watch Caledonia win.  We didn't go to the game, and now I kind have wish we would have.  Oh well.  Again, this evening I drank but still remembered things.  Yay.  Andy also showed me how to play Keno this weekend.  And that game is evil.  I know I'll never win, but I keep playing.  EVIL.

And then this morning I drove back to go to work.  Except I was 45 minutes late.  Whoops!  I don't think anyone noticed, and I'm going to say I got here on time on my time card.  And I don't feel guilty about it either. :)"

"event","Tailgating season has come to an end.  So sad.

We went out with a bang yesterday, with an extra long 9am to 4pm long tailgate.  It was fantastic.  We had beers, cider and rum, hotdogs, and a good time.  The only incident of the day happened when Andy and I were tossing a football around.  I caught it with 2 of my nails, which caused them to bend backwards and my finger began bleeding quite badly.  Good thing I was drunk otherwise it might have hurt.  We returned home to Kara's just in time to watch UofM lose.  MSU then proceeded to lose as well, but at least that was expected.

In other news, Caledonia was playing in the Lansing Area on Saturday for the HS Football State Semi-Finals.  And they WON!  I'm going to try and convince Andy to go with me to the Finals next weekend, since it's at Ford Field and we will be in D-town anyways.  Go Scots!  I'm glad ONE of the teams I root for can win.  (The Lions are losing at the moment as well.)  Thankfully they won last weekend when I took Andy to the game for his B-Day.  On that note, here's a news story I wish to share with you all:


DETROIT(AP) - A seven-year-old boy was at the center of a Detroit, MI courtroom drama yesterday when he challenged a court ruling over who should have custody of him. The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulations, requiring that family unity be maintained to the degree possible.

The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried out that they also beat him.

After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.

After two recesses to check legal references and confer with child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Detroit Lions, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone. 

Tee hee!!"

Kerri and I were out tailgating at 7 am as usual on Saturday morning.  I froze my nuts off and it was pitch black when we first got there.  It was also the LEAST turnout for a tailgate I have EVER seen.  Seriously.  There were like 3 other cars there.  I friggin' hate their new policy.  It sucks ass.  Way to kill tailgating ASMSU and friends.  You suck.

Then I sobered up and drove to Andy's where we attended his after party for rugby.  Oh yes, and his team won which made them league champions!  Go Detroit Tradesmen go!  I accidently drank too much beer though, and we didn't make it to the Halloween party after the bar.  I was fine, but then I got to the car, laid down, and didn't exactly have the wits to get back up again, much less change into my Halloween costume.  I really wasn't that drunk, I think I was also extremely tired.  It was still a fun night. :)

We woke up Sunday morning and went to Coney for breakfast, picked up a Sunday paper, and Andy bought Arrested Development Season 2 and I bought The Office.  We came back and watched the Lions lose, went for a motorcycle ride to a dog park where we watched cute doggies play, then we made a nice dinner and watched our DVD's for the rest of the evening.  We woke up Monday and watched more DVD's.  It was pretty much the laziest weekend I've had in forever, and it was fantastic.

Today we stopped at Bdubs for lunch and also went to a Pet Shop where we played with a black cocker spaniel puppy.  I want a puppy so bad it hurts.  Are you reading this Kara?  If you are *cough*letsbuyapuppy*cough*."

First, the Wings games was sweet on Wednesday.  I got there in GREAT time (thank goodness) and we got to enjoy a pounding of the Blues.  I think my favorite part was the Shanahan fight, because let's face it, fights are sweet.

On Friday I again raced to Detroit to go to the Joe.  This time, however, it was for the Weezer/Foo Fighter concert.  We had floor seats, and I got to experience the thrashing of the crowd.  My big toes still hurt from being stepped on.  I'm pretty sure I'm developing bruises as well.  But it was sweet.  Dave Grohl was about 10 yards from me.  It was fantastical.  Andy even moshed a little.  And I got to be with 5 guys who all have huge man crushes on Dave.  I'm pretty sure they'd all do him if they had the chance.

Saturday I went to Andy's rugby game, and he scored TWO tris!!  He'd never scored before (well, this was only his 2nd game) but he totally rocked.  Terp was kind enough to come keep me company while we watched the game.  So we enjoyed some beers and watched Andy get dirty and beat up.  Andy and I left immediately after the game because he was a little nervous that they might make him Zulu. :)

Then Andy and I came back Saturday night for KERRI'S BIRTHDAY!  YAY!!  We all went to Rum Runner's and had a blasty blast.  I didn't go back to the Moose's though after the bar and it felt wrong and dirty not to.  Kara took my place though, and I'm sure she kept them all entertained.  And by that I mean she pry took her top off.  

And today I had to change my work shift because Andy got tickets for free to today's Wings game!!  I'm pumped, and it's the return of DMac to the Joe!  Fingers crossed that Stevie plays!!! :)"

"event","This weekend was sweet, despite the Spartans fucking up yesterday.

Friday arrived, and I was thankful, because it had been a long week.  We sort of had a par-tay at our house.  This was basically inevitable since we had about 10 people coming to spend the night on our floor.  Beers were consumed, Moose was played, and had only fallen asleep for about 2 hours when . . . BAM, it was 6 am and time to start drinking again.  We rallied the troops and this tailgate's theme was ""You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning.""  Fitting really.  I definately did my first beer bong around 8am.  Which is nothing compared to Andy, who had probably bonged 3 beers by the time.  He actually stated around 10pm that night when he cracked open a Coor's ""This is the first beer I have sipped all day.""  The other 10 or so had been consumbed via bong or via shotgunning.  

The tailgate rocked.  It was our largest gathering yet, and it was fantastic.  Except for when I first got there and set down my phone on the table, and someone spilled coffee on it, and it decided to not work anymore.  It's still broken actually.  Now I have to pay $50 to get it replaced.  Roar.  Oh well.  The festivities of yesterday make up for it.

It was somewhat of a Belligerent reunion at the tailgate.  This means there was a belligerent huddle where we consumed about 5 or 6 bottles of Boone's farm in about 3 minutes.  It was fantastic.  I really don't remember much of yesterday, just bits and peices.

Kerri wrote ""Muck Fichigan"" on her car.
We wandered over to the 10 o'clock shot group, and consumed a 10 o'clock shot.
I peed in front of Kerri's car.
Andy did a beer bong while standing on a cooler.
We were parked next to Tits Magee.
On the walk in, some random guy cheered Andy's beer bong, so Andy ran to his trunk and helped him bong a beer.
We commandered our own port-a-potty.
People were pissed that we commandered our own port-a-potty.
For the first time in a long time, nobody flashed any private parts. (Right??)
Andy peed in a bush.
Green hair paint was used profusely.
After the loss, I threw over all chairs near me while screaming and kicking things.

I really don't remember a lot apparently.  Please feel free to add to the list.  I can't wait to see the pictures."

Have I put you to sleep yet??

Anyways, I swear, this is my last whiny, bitchy post of woe-is-me-ness.  My life isn't that bad, in fact it's quite splendid, so someone just slap me and tell me to suck it up and shut the fuck up.

In GOOD news, tomorrow I go to Detroit to attend a Tigers game with Andy and his workmates.  Then we're going to the Detroit Zoo on Saturday, if there's nice weather.  I heart the weekends.  Last weekend we saw The Sam Roberts Band in Detroit (which was sweet) and attended Andy's cousin's wedding in some small town an hour and change north of Lansing.  It was all lovely.  I think I might actually drink tomorrow.  I haven't really done that in a LONG time.  Like 2 weeks.  I'm starting to get the shakes.

Speaking of drinking, UofM/State Tailgate in T minus 8 days.  If you're reading this, you're invited.  And by ""invited"" I mean ""absolutely for sure coming"".  *cough*KRISTEN*cough*"

"event","I haven't updated in awhile because I've been slightly busy.  And it sucks.  If I could just work 35 hours a week and do 8 hours of classes I'd be set.  It's the working 25 hours on top of that (for actual PAY) in a job I hate that really makes me hurt inside.

Anyways, the elementary is fantastic.  My CT is amazing.  Seriously.  I want to be as good a teacher as her someday.  My kids are wonderful.  We got a new boy last week from Louisiana whose house was destroyed by Katrina.  And a new girl from Russia.  And a new boy from Lansing.  Not that Lansing is an exciting and far away place, but there you go.

And I have returned to my tailgating ways.  It's fantastic.  Although I've been sick for the past week, and had to tailgate with a cold this past Saturday.  Should I have tailgated for my own health?  Probably not.  Did I tailgate anyways?  Probably yes.  And I don't regret it.  I then stopped drinking to allow myself time to sober up and drive to Dearborn to visit Andy.  There also happened to be a wedding occurring where many a Belligerent Camper was a guest about 10 minutes away from Andy's.  This meant we were the DD's to pick them up once midnight rolled around.  Kara and Chris rode in my backseat and got into a boxing/kickboxing match.  This was thoroughly entertaining, of course.  It was mostly Kara's doing, of course.  She punched Chris AT LEAST 15 times, and also kicked him straight across the face.  She then came home and punched EVERYBODY (7 of us) except me.  I'm not sure if I should feel lucky or left out.  I then called in sick on Sunday.  Partially because I was sick and partially because Andy was having a Lions Opening Day par-tay.  That reminds me, GO LIONS.

Well, there's a quick update for you all!  Now time for me to finish up another 14 hour day.  WOO HOO."

It actually makes the work day go faster, even though it's slightly more stressful.  Good thing my life outside of work has been so wonderful or otherwise I might be in a bad mood. ;)

Andy came to visit yesterday and he came bearing gifts.  One gift was Bdubs chicken.  The other gift was a new TV for Kara.  I think the chicken is the better gift. ;) Kara actually is paying for the TV, but it was only in stock at the Dearborn Best Buy.  So Andy was wonderful and picked it up on his way in.  So we now have a 20"" flat screen TV instead of the measely 13"" we used to have.  It's fantastic.

I haven't had to go to the elementary these past days, so it's been nice to have some time off and watch US Open tennis.  My boy James Blake won today, and it was a good match to watch.  And tomorrow I get to go to ROLLING STONES BABY.  I'm totally psyched, the show has been getting awesome reviews.

And of course, 3 days till Bday fun and 4 days till Tailgate fun!  I can't wait.  Oh yes.  And if you are reading this, you should pry be coming to the tailgate on Saturday.  This is assuming that under MSU's new fucked up tailgate policy that Kerri and I get a spot.  I don't even wanna get into how PISSED OFF I am at that new policy.  But assuming all goes well, we will be at the tennis courts, in the Big Black Blazer, being drunk and disorderly.  You know you don't wanna miss that. ;)"

"event","I heart Dane Cook.

He was great last night, as always.  I realized, this is the 5th time I've seen him, and WOW has he come a long way.  First time I saw his show was about 5 years ago, and it was a little comedy club venue and there were pry 50 people there.  Now he's selling out huge arenas that seat more than 3000!!  It's fantastic!  I'm glad everyone is learning to love him as much as I do!  And me and Danielle take full credit for spreading the Dane love.  ;)

I also got quite tipsy last night.  We met at a Bdubs near the venue before AND after the show.  I did 4 shots and had 4 double duecers during the after portion.  Danielle tried to give me a piggy back ride to the car but we both ended up falling over.  You'd have thought I'd learned my lesson about piggy back rides while drunk after Chris dropped Jamie a few years back, but, alas, I have not.  And I have the scrapes on my back to prove it.

I've also come to realize I think I make the wrong first impression on a lot of people.  I met one of Andy's friends last night, although Andy was not in attendance as he was still up yonder.  People began telling stories from Belligerent Camping, and I think he began to think I was a raging slut and/or alcoholic.  I tried to explain that REALLY I'm not usually like that and Turp interjected ""I've met Juli about 5 or 6 times now and she's been drunk everytime.""  I'm not that bad, though, right?


Right?

Back to being busy and barely being able to breathe.  I may actually go crazy next year, just to warn all of you.  I've only been at it one day and I already feel exhausted.  Really I'm just bitching, and I know I'll be fine, I just have to get used to this again.  I was enjoying my summer of only working 40 hours a week.

So I went to a meeting with a bunch of the interns and coordinating teachers this morning, then me and my teacher went back to start setting up the classroom.  I really love my CT, I can totally tell that her and I will get along swimmingly.  She's laid back like me, which is a HUGE plus.  Everyone at that school loves her and tells me how lucky I am to have gotten her, so that makes me feel good too.  I think she's an amazing teacher.  It was fun to go through the class list and see who we'd be getting.  We have 2 challenges in the classroom next year, but we think one will be moved to the other 2nd grade.  Other than that most of our students seem to be high achievers and we even have a couple of gifted students.  A wide range of abilities and also extremely racially diverse as well.  I'm excited!!

It just sucked having to go home for a hot second and eat and then coming straight to work.  That's what I'll be doing 3 times a week next semester and probably all of next year though!  Oh well, I CAN DOOOOOO IT!!!  I'm drinking a Mountain Dew right now to get some energy back in my weary bones.

And I haven't had anyone to vent to really about all of this either!  I saw Kara for half a second and slightly vented to her, and I would have come into work and then talked to Kerri but she's on vacation all week.  And Andy is on his silly hiking trip with no cell phone service.  So that means I get to vent on here to all of you who happen to read this.

Ahhh.  I don't know if any of you feel better after all of that dribble, but I sure do. ;)"

So, I officially (well 99.99%) have a subleaser.  I was giddy.  I am not ashamed to say I literally danced around the house.  She just has to go in and do the paperwork, but she liked my would-have-been roommates and said she wanted it.  This is good because paying $635 in rent for August is not something I want to have to do again.

I also broke my bank account fixing my car.  It stopped being able to turn on Tuesday morning.  Apparently I needed a new front rack, which invites the question, what the fuck is a front rack?  I don't know, but they cost $850.  And I needed a new power steering pump.  And new front tires.  And an alignment.  Let's just say I got these things done, and I now have $35.76 in my savings account.  Go me.

I used my bad car though to my advantage and called into work on Friday.  I told them that I was stuck in GR because my car wouldn't start.  Mwahahaha.  Really I just wanted to spend the day with Andy because he left to go on a hiking trip for 9 days, so I wouldn't get to see him for awhile.  And it was totally worth calling in for too.  We had a fabulous day together which included eating at Bravo and having a patio umbrella fall on my head which led to us getting free dessert.  Ya-hoo.

Well, that's all for now kids.  I'm sure I have plenty more stories to tell, but well, my fingers are tired and I bet your eyes are too.  Plus it's a beautiful day out so I'm gonna go enjoy it. :)"

Except Kerri, Kara and I played the girl role at the baseball game and chit chatted the entire time and didn't really pay attention to the game.  Occasionally I would find myself glancing at the score, but that was about it.  We then left early because we all had a hankering for BDubs chicken.  Bdubs had a lovely drink special going called $3 martinis.  Mmmm, chocotinis.  I definately got tipsy and I definately got dancy.  I got Kara to dance though and that's generally one of my goals, since that means she's drunk.  

So this morning I felt like CRAP.  I think I was just sleep deprived or something.  I nearly called into work sick because I felt so shitty, but I managed to make it here and the first hour or two was crap, but I'm feeling better now.  Yay.  Except today is a Kerri-less Friday at work, so that makes me slightly sad. :("

Everybody waves at everyone when they are driving, and I'm not exagerrating.  Seriously.  Anyone you pass you must wave at.  But it's not like you're being forced, you generally want to be happy and friendly with all of these other happy, friendly people.  When you walk down the road and pass people you exchange smiles and hellos.  Whilst bike riding you will also be exchanging waves and hellos with passers by.  I have honestly never been in so happy a place before in my life.  It was fantastic.

Friday I left East Lansing at 10am, to get to Kalamazoo by 11:30 and pick up Danielle and then drove 5 hours to Charlevoix to catch the 5:30 ferry over which led to us actually arriving around 8pm on Friday night.  Aunt Carol and Uncle Mitch put us up in a hotel room that was nicer than any apartment I have ever lived in.  We got tipsy at the town tavern and called it a night.

Saturday we rented bikes for 4 hours and explored the gynormousness that is Beaver Island.  It was the best ever.  Actually, the word for the weekend was ""perfectness"" because everything was beautiful, happy and perfect.  Then we picked up the Swayze clan and headed to their cottage, which was also extremely nice.  We enjoyed some delicious Oberon's and white Sangria and passed out watching Old School.

Sunday I officially golfed nine holes.  Well, if you call what I did with that club and that ball ""golf"".  I did get a double boogie on one of the holes, but my average score was pry around 8.  It was still a good time.  We then caught the 5:30 ferry out, and I arrived home in Cali around 11:30 that night.  Then I got to wake up this morning and drive back to East Lansing so I could work.  Yay work.

So my recommendation to everyone is: go to Beaver Island.  You cannot be on that island and be unhappy, I guarantee it."

"event","Alright, I'm gonna do my best to remember what the hell happened this weekend.  More for my own sake than to entertain whoever may read this.  Keeping in mind that others will read this though, I'm gonna do my best to keep it relatively PG.

Karadactyl and I arrived around 2am on Thursday night/Friday morning.  We were able to identify the site by the illuminated pirate flag hanging off of James's pop-up.  I was drunk by 3am.  I then passed out, but somehow managed to tear the fizzuck out of my thumb in the process.  Although that was pry the tamest of the UDI's (Unidentified Drinking Injury) that occured on the trip.

Friday morning I woke up and began drinking again.  I'm pretty sure I was drunk by 10.  This experience of course made me miss tailgating.  (46 days and counting.  And yes I just counted.)  I then passed out in the pop-up, which I'm pretty sure led to some scandalous pictures being taken involving my head and Chris's naughties.  Then, after a shot of cooler water, it was off to the beach where we made fast friends with the beach bums.  Probably because we saw a little of us reflected in each of them.  I could fill up an entry with just stories of them, so I'll just let you know that one of them was a pirate named Morgan and call it good.

It was on our drive back from the beach that we made a mistake.  We attempted to dine in a family restaurant.  Although I think our appearance did help us get the FASTEST service I've ever experienced at Pizza Hut, or any restaurant for that matter.  We were generally able to act decent enough, with the exception of Chris.  I think he only has two volumes to his voice when he's drunk, loud and louder.  And he chose to use the louder volume when telling Kara something about a BJ.  This meant it was time to leave, and retreat to our campsite far from public view.

Friday night is pretty much a giant blur.  Chris passed out almost immediately and the rest of us began the night with a Belligerent Huddle.  This consisted of us yelling ""Belligerent"" on 3 and then passing around numerous bottles of Boone's farm and timing our consumption pace.  I believe the official Boone's Farm consumption tally from the weekend neared 30.  After that I remember playing horseshoes, but my shitty play led to many shots being consumed, and then the night gets fuzzy.  I hear my behavior was decidedly non-PG though, so I'm just gonna move on to Saturday.

Saturday morning I awoke to a pink and slightly swollen right eye.  I have no idea what happened to it, but it remained pink for the rest of the trip.  This morning was pretty much a repeat performance of my Friday morning.  Although this time I woke up from my morning pass out before any inappropriate pictures could be taken.  After some discussion, we decided to go to the beach instead of mixing it up with a cabrewing trip (which we better friggin' do next year, because that would be sweet).  Andy had a bar of soap so I was able to make Lake Michigan my bathtub, but my filthiness was really too extensive for a bar of soap to do a whole lot.  I'm pretty sure the sight of me wandering the beach with my unwashed, matted hair, wearing Andy's dirt shirt and holding a can of beer would have made most people avoid making eye contact with me.  So we laid around, slapped bladders of wine, played volleyball, and somewhere along the line, someone found a crab pincher.  Naturally, I attatched it to my left nipple.  Unfortunately I lost track of it as the night proceeded, because that would have been a fun souvenir.

We decided to go for the fast food approach coming back from the beach this time.  Aaron decided to give the cashier my phone number refering to me as ""Pink Eye"", and I can't figure out why he hasn't called me yet.  I ate my nuggets and then it was decided that it was time to puke on Andy, although I switched it up this year and vomitted down the front of his shirt instead of the back.  I remember more of this night, but that's not really saying a whole lot.  Drinking games were played, pirate and your mom jokes were made, wax candles were eaten, and I got to chop up state property for firewood again, so I was happy.

The ride back Sunday was excrutiatingly long, most likely due to the fact that I was ridiculously nauseous and allowed Kara to listen to country music for a good portion of the drive.  Thankfully I was able to keep down my frisco salad.  The shower after Belligerent Camping is always the best shower in the world.  Although it takes me at least a week to really get clean again, and if you'd have seen my feet Sunday morning you'd understand why.  Let's just say at one point I attempted to do a shot of ketchup, but ended up spitting it on the ground and later stepped in it.  I took a picture of my clothing from Saturday night with Kara's camera, so I'll have to post that later.    

So that is the weekend that was Belligerent Camping 2005, the weekend that proves our motto:  You Booze, You Win."

We will be leaving EL at midnight when Kara gets off work and arriving there at nearly 3am to begin the 3 day drinking binge.  I think James' quote, at Sunday brunch after the weekend, sums up belligerent camping.  He had us go around the table and announce our degrees, and then said,

I was drinking by 3:30.  I didn't stop until 12 hours later.  I suppose that's good practice for Belligerent Camping in a few days.  I think the best part of the night was around 1am when we decided to play beer pong.  Except we didn't have a table.  So we improvised.  Nick got stools from inside and found a door in the garage and VOILA beer pong table.  Yes, we are that ghetto.  That's around the point in the night where everything gets blurry.  I remember swimming.  I remember getting a beer dumped on my head.  I remember showering.  I remember using potholders for pillows.  I do not, however, remember WHY all of those events occurred.

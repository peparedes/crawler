"event","I got into it with my grandpa today.  Thats not cool I know.  He told me I need to grow up, but hes's the one that throw a bitch fit if you don't do things his way.  He has sit on his ass for the past 50 some odd years while my grandma waits on him hand and foot.  She could be crawling on her bleeding knuckles and he would tell her to ge get him a glass of milk.  I love my grandpa I really do.  I would roll over and die for him if I had to, but it just seem like that I can't do anything right for him.  I know that he's getting old and stufff, but he's been doing this to me for years.  He used to do it to my dad and dad would do just about anything for him.  It seems like that I am just a overall fuck up.  I always seem to upset someone.  Maybe I should just keeep my mouth shut from now on...Don't count on it though."

"event","I wish I could fix all things in our lives.  I feel so good when I'm with her.  It's unbearable to think of life without her. If life could only be easier.  It's amazing...When she's upset, I'm upset.   When she's happy, I'm happy.  We don't even have to be together...it just happens.  I have never met someone that I have this strong of a bond with.  I love her so much.  She asked me if she was getting more than three strikes.  I will probably forgive her no matter what she does.  That's just the way I am.  She makes me so very happy.  I'm never going to love another woman with the passion and soul that I love her with."

"event","I played with those losers in Quanah yesterday cause I needed the money.  I guess it wasnt that bad, except the steel guitar RIPPING MY FUCKING HEAD OFF!  But its ok.  I'm cool.  I really hate playing cuntree music but it pays...sometimes.  Well anyway I get to go to wichita with my gurl tonite.  I have to take Mom's car cause my heater core is busted...its pouring antifreeze all in the cab, not cool.  I hope I can get it fixed soon.  Mom dont let me smoke in her car.

"event","I am so stupid.  Why do I jump to conclusions so much?  She didn't leave, just overslept.  I hope she isn't mad at me for thinking that.  She means so much to me.  I can't imagine life without her.  I guess I'm so insecure because she is so fucking wonderful.  She would make anyone happy.  There isn't one thing wrong with her.  Oh well, I guess I'm done."

"event","I guess she found someone else to be with last night.  How can one person make you feel so fucking good and so fucking awful.  You know my marital staus.  I havent even been with my wife since I commited myself to this girl.  The sad thing is...I'll forgive her.  I know that I'm just setting myself up for a heartbreak, but I don't fucking care.  I love her so much.  I had to leave choir because I just couldn't take it anymore.  I had to lock myself in the bathroom so noone could see my tears. I need her.  I need her bad.  She is the only thing that keeps me going.  And the way it looks she's going to be the death of me. She's got my heart in her hands, and I guess when she drinks, gets high, or get horny, she doesnt realize that she's crushing it.  So if I don't end up in a mental institution or in the ground soon its going to be a fucking miricale.  Damn I just want to die when I feel this way.  The thing is...I'm NOT mad. Hurt maybe..hurt definelty, but not mad. I really have no right to tell her what to do and what not to do.  But damn this hurts.  I'm throwing up I'm so upset.  I guess I don't mean to her what I thought I did.  Maybe this was what she meant by not knowing what the future held.  I didnt know she meant future like 24 hrs.  I guess I should just enjoy the memories of the good times.  I really thought she loved me too.  I'm starting to womder now.  There is no doubt in my mind that I love her.  I love her more than life itself.  I guess I told her too much.  Smothered her maybe.  Its sad.  I'll just forgive her.  Maybe I'm pussy whipped.  Or maybe I just love her too much.  I don't know.  I wish I did.  Baby, if you read this...I will always love you.  Today, tommorow, and for the rest of my life (however long that may be)"

"event","Well, just thought I'd check in a gain since theres absolutley nothing to do before computer class.  I really want to see her.  I wish I could have gone back to Vernon last nite.  That would have been awesome.  I'll hopefully get to see her in computer class.  Hopefully she didn't oversleep.  I called a little before nine to make sure she was up, but there was no answer.  Either she is dead to the world or she got up in time.  Hopefully the later.  I have to go to Wichita again today for Networking class.  I hope she can go with me.  That would be so fucking awesome.  Hell, just getting to see her is enough for me.  I need to quit smoking.  I want a fucking cigarette and I know I dont need it.  It was so wonderful being with her the last time she went to Wichita with me.  I know I sound like a teenager in love, but I have never felt this way about another human being before.  We have so much in common its scary.  She said we could switch brains and nobody would know the difference.  Other than te fact that she woud be checkng out chicks and I would be checking out dudes (YUCK!).  You know I don't know what I did to deserve to be as happy as I am when I am with her.  I hope I will never lose her.  eriously, anyone who is luckly enough to gain her love is the luckiest man in the world.  I have this bond with her that is so incredible.  Even without our physical relationship (witch is thermonuclear) I would be happy with her.  Oh well.  I know I'm starting to soud like a lovesick fool, so I'll jet for now.

"event","Seems like the only time I'm happy is when I'm with her...the love of my life.  We went to Wichita last night together and drove each other crazy until we had to stop outside of Electra and fuck each other silly on the side of the road.  Some people stopped to ""help"" when they saw us, but quickly backed away.  God I am so fucking much in love with her and she says she loves me, but I still get scared that her ex will somehow win her back.  I don't think I could go on after that.  I wish I had the resources to end my unfortunate marital situation.  I just want to run off to Mexico with her.  You know...Tijuana, Tequila, and a bucket of chicken.  I can't think about anything else but her.  It's driving me freaking crazy.  I hope she realized that I would be more than happy to spen the rest of my life with her.  She makes me so happy when the rest of the world doesn't do anything but piss me off!

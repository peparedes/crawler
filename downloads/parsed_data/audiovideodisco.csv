I didn't take this picture, but i thought that it deserved the space here. Pictures of a storm taken over Saskatoon June 28th, 2005.  Personally, i've always been a little awestruck by weather of this sort.  Seriously, look at those clouds, they look like they are coming to eat the city.

I've also been told that they got 70mm of rain that day.  Doesn't seem like much, but let's see you try to cover an entire city in that much water.  I dare you.  The typical month of june get's 60mm.  that day got 70mm.  ouch.  Mind you, that's not much compared the 500mm or so Goman saw them get in parts of australia.  half a meter of water in a day.  that's absurd.

I can't wait to see some storms in toronto this year.  love it.

wow, that's alot of talk about the rain... sorry.

there's more picture available if you click on the scary clouds.

also, apparently i'm five years old."

<br>""King and Atlantic, 11:15pm""</center>

So it occurred to me today that we, as canadians, are living in very incalculable, zany, interesting (call it what you will) times.  

First of all:

Tonight Parliament passed legislation that legalizes same-sex marriages.  The bill allows same-sex partners the same legal protection and the same rights as a mismatched-sex couple. However, the bill does recognize that not every religion is cool with two dudes or two dudettes hooking up.  In other words, if you're gay and looking to get hitched, town hall is the place to make things happen... 'cause the church isn't obligated to recognize your love.  

Personally, I think that this is a very well written and executed piece of legislation.  On one hand the gay and lesbian community can now enjoy the same status, legally and socially, that the hetero community has been enjoying for years.  On the other hand, the religious groups are not forced to take part if it's against their beliefs.  What more could you ask for?  God gets his way and heathens get survivor benefits.
<lj-cut>
But some of us aren't happy with this.  The first two that come to mind are: King Klein and Creepy Harper.  Both of them have come out with possible stratagies to combat this new legislation.  Both of them, in this dude's humble opinion, are out to lunch.

Harper has stated that the more conservative Canadians need not worry.  When the conservatives re-claim the house next election... they'll simply over turn the law.  It never happened.  The only problem I see with this is that, as i mentioned, churches are not obligated to preform same-sex marriages.  Typically the right has used the ""it's against the religious definition of marriage"" argument... but Mr. Martin saw to that.  With that argument gone they will be forced to rely on the good ol' ""this is bad for children/families"".  Have you seen the divorce rates in North America?  differing-sex couples are bad for families.

Klein on the other hand is taking a more direct approach.  A few Albertans... i'm sorry, i honestly can no longer understand what goes on in the heads of my fellow prairie-folk so don't ask me to explain... A few Albertans have asked that Klein invokes the ""Not Withstanding Clause"" which would allow Alberta to basically ignore this new federal law.

That's not good enough for King Klein.  What he has suggested today is that Alberta gets out of the marriage business.  Revoke the Provincial Marriage Act and leave any sort of marryin' to religious unions only. In other words, get rid of civil unions in the province of Alberta.  Since the law only protects civil rights churches, temples etc. in Alberta would be free to refuse gay weddings.  

Although this is a pretty clever way to maintain your homophobia, i'm talking to the entire province, it will need to be justified.  As much of a cowboy that Klein is, i don't think the argument ""I just don't like queers"" would fly all that far.  I think that Klein is stuck on the same train as Harper.  Both are going to have to find a new way to justify their opposition lest they look like bigots.  

This is just the start of the issue.  Let's not forget the last minute deal making and other questionable (depending on which party your'e in and which way the wind is blowing) tactics that have played out in this session of Parliament.  All I can say is that i'm glad they've adjourned for the summer because I couldn't take another day of this drama-fest.

Moving on.
actually no.  I'll get to  you tomorrow.  when i'm not so tired face.
</lj-cut>

So much going on in this city at all times.  It's crazy. That's what I love about Toronto.  While out on Queen with Randy.  We were purchasing parts for some trivia buzzzers... yeah, nerds.  Anyway, as we walked by much the Killers were playing a few tracks for their sound check.  Apparently it's the Much Music Video Awards tonight.  While i don't regret having to work while the awards are on, I do regret missing the killers show.  They sound very good live.  They played the track 'All these things that i've done'.  The break down near the end was awesome, and they had a group of people doing backups.  so good.  i can't explain this enough.

They did however, look like a bunch of tools.  Kind of like every single band featured on the front page of purevolume.com.  it's pretty ridiculous, right Neil?

anyway, killers good.  toronto good.  the toppings are cursed, that's bad.

Now that i live in toronto and take pictures and do things, i imagine i'll post more here, or at thinkmagazine.ca.  but this will be more of my personal musings.  I'll leave the real writing to people who know how."

"event","so today fate and i squared off. as always i lost... i remember thinking today that there was something that clicked. i understood. it was like one of those moments when shit makes sense. but i've gone and forgotten what clicked. i guess that proves nothing more than i was wrong back then. the only thing that clicked was my feeling of self envy.

but then i think... hmmm, neo vodtrin would make me feel better. let me tell you about the wonders of neo vodtrin... it's my fix all elix'r of life. if this was the wild west, i'd have a horse drawn carriage, a walking stick and a bowler. i'd go from berg to berg proclaiming the virtues of my fix'r elix'r Dr. Johnson's fix'r elix'r they'd call it (the emo cowboys would call it fix'her elix'r). one day though, a burly looking cowboy with a black beard and red bandana would challange me to a duel. he'd be upset because my elix'r didn't give him everlasting life, make him rich and famous like i had promised last time i rolled through his two bit, one horse town.

anyway, he'd challange me and i'd try and counter it with free elix'r.

of course, since i'm a smooth talking fellow and he's no more than a simple gun slinger, he'd accept. especially after i told him that the elix'r would improve his aim and make him the best gun slinger in the west.

sometimes i love being me."

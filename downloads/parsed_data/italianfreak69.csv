"event","i keep havin flashbacks from  some of my fondest meories through the yrs from mom and me when i was young comin home and em bein so excited to see her to my grandparents being together and happy , i miss when i was young and fmaily was  most of my life and i  had no worries no internet jsut watched cartoons and  early mtv. 
amazing howw fast that time goes, ur parents arent kiddin dont  grow up to fast ull never get that time back.
shit i even miss just the good tiems i use to have with friends ppl i cant get a hold fo now  no matter how many times i call or are jsut to busy or coem up with excuses to no  be bothered with me.
only thing goin well is career path is finally taking form and that makes me feel soo good but work isnt everything"

I wish i could go back and correct them but that wouldnt be real life.  to   anyone and everyone who feels i did them wrong  specifically fl i say im sorry my intentions were always  good but i guess not realistic. when i go back to ny  you'll be done with me for quite sometime. i start all over but this time i keep  the knowledge from  the past to help me not repeat my mistakes in the future.  who knows where ill be elad now the one thing im sure of is im doing this for me and no one else this time no bullshit excuse to cover up other motive im goin back cause its what i wanted. last time i  listened to my heart and not my mind i got burned big time this time i refuse to even go close enough to feel the  flame burning."

silhoutte around the golden ten like lambs on my face Ive hidden
away any embarrassment, away from my aquaintteness
I'm not sold on anything but half a dream
(I'm not sensing a thing)
i see a blank notebook page
and its my life and
there is nothing I can think to write
I guess I'm not im not sensing a thing
I hope you dont see a thing
smile through everyone you ever see
so what you gave him the time of day twist back with any supreme
I dance around I honestly give up and de robe right side falls
It's my life and I'm nothing I can think to write not anymore not sensing a thing.
right side because heavenly, greacefully you,
I owe you too
Smile, I'm, because heavenly life should be so easy
Right side because heavenly, gracefully you,
I owe you too x2"

Come and go now as you please
Your actions write the melodies
To the songs that we sing
And you just sing

And I finally found that life goes on without you
And my world still turns when you're not around

Is this the way you want it?
Is this the way it has to be?
Sitting here beside you
But my heart's lost in New Orleans
Dreams come clever
Hearts now severed
Difference of forever
And I am lost there

Come and go now as you please
Your actions write the melodies
To the songs that we sing
And you just sing along out loud"

Lets close the casket on everything.
On this institution and on every memory,
Burn it all in effigy, lets watch it burn.

And I'll die alone, but I get lost in your eyes
and I cant help but feel like
I'll never find love there again.

Dressed in white you mourned nothing
As you led the precession on with a smile.
There was no eulogy given for no kind words
Could be conjured up this time.
No not a single word or praise could escape
From your lips on that day.
There was no more need to conjure up things
That made things seem ok.

Fell into the depths of a broken heart again.
And I'll die alone, but I get lost in your eyes
and I cant help but feel like
I'll never find love there again.

As you walk on, ash falls like snow.
Can you express regret?
Or just let a smile show?
Please just walk on.
Dont respond, I already know.

the sunsets and your eyes as clear as life,
spelling the name of surprise, the most beautiful girl under the skies.
i miss home and i miss you.
i miss your flower dresses and your smell.
all i ever wanted was to give you the world.
this cool concord air reminds me of you
and all the letters you wrote me telling me you loved me.
i want to hear that again, like fireworks.
remember?
every song we ever shared still echoes silent prayers.
remember february 26?
it was ""you and me in the summertime.""
i wrote down the day i never wanted to forget.
the skies are ripe tonight to feel this air and fly.
kiss and say goodbye, tonight's the night we fly.
and i wont forget the way you made me feel
and i didn't think this kiss would be our last goodbye.
goodbye.
i want to hold you one more time but the summer came and went. 
now all i have is the memories and the air that reminds me of a peach.
i miss you."

Why is it  that the small things truly mean the most in the end and thats what I lack. I've had them at one tiem or another but for  some reason there not here now. Am I suppost to  find them?

 I've been sleeping here for days
Hope I die before my dreams drive me insane
When you're not around I might let my guard down
Don't keep me waiting
You can't understand my nightmares
Bad dreams are all that I can keep
Locked in a room where all my dreams come true
Scrape my mind off the walls painted pretty blue
Collective thoughts fill my brain
but every night it's just the same
Don't keep me waiting
You can't understand my nightmares
Bad dreams are all that I can keep
You can't understand my nightmares
Don't you close your eyes to see

"event","So i look at life now and everything happening for a reason maybe i finally slowed down and can see it all now without this fuckin blindfold ive had on for so long. I wanna know why im suppost to walk around  pretending to knwo whuts not goin on down in fl. do ppl think im that stupid? just spit out ur fuckin intentions none of this fuckin bullshit so and so. I cant beleive my intellect is thought to be that  of someone retarded. Everythign so different now  this is true and in 6 months it will be even more. thigns uve heard or uve percieved through things uve heard is ridiculous but hey  everyoen believes what they want i choose not to beleive bullshit myself personally. I  like to find the truth out the old fashion way on my own. I will never regret my decision to coem to ny again its one fo the best thigns ive ever doen  no matter hwo much i may make it sound im miserable and lonely  there small prices to pay to have  enjoyed the last half yr this much. i even had a 2month glimpse of what  i truly wanted maybe it wasnt a glimpse but all i was goin to get and now  i have to realize it. Maybe one day ill actually get to have the life i want but for now ill jsut live one day at a time cause tomorrow could be the last one u jsut dont know. thats whut makes life so beautiful  cause its somethin u can lose at anytime and therefore u want to hold on to it as long as possible. I miss what i use to have but since everyoen lookin toward the future i will too and what might or might not coem  my way. when ig et back to fl everythign will be interestin some ppl will hate me soem will  dislike some fo my new decisions and some ill jsut be meeting another chapter in my book of life. Hope the next one is full of fun time and plenty of memories cause thats whut im goin to sure as hell try and make it no matter whos part of my social life

As far as how can someone love somebody even though the other  could care less  i dont know how about u ask me., cause no matter whut happens i have love for that girl and its just down right sad. new no nothings new just true colors comin out!

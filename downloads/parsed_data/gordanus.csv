"event","dear friends of Gordon,

This is Mario (<b>Lj lostcosmonaut</b>), Gordon's good friend and roommate.  I am very unhappy to report to you that Gordon took his own life yesterday.  I am so sorry.  I am so sorry to have to tell you this.

In his suicide note, Gordon gave me th passwd to this acct and requested that I let his friends know.  You probably know that Gordon has been severely depressed for a good long while.  Gordon, I am really very sorry that life was so unhappy for you.  You are thought very highly of by many people.  We will miss you, very much so, I wish you would know that.  Friends of Gordon, take good care of yourselves and each other.

"event","Not visually stunning. Boring in fact. Could have gone further if it really wanted to look like a comic book. Bad performances with some exceptions: Rutger Hauer(somebody needs to give him work), Benecio Del Toro, Mickey O'Rourke (grudgingly, barely). None of the women stood out (even though their tits and ass did) with maybe a slight nod to the actress that played the lesbian parole officer. The storylines were juvenile. Think moody high school goth kid. I'm sure that's the point, but that doesn't make it any better. I'm also bothered by the naive quasi-pseudo-macho-feminist messages. There is only one female character that isn't a whore in the entire movie. Even the little girl becomes a stripper. 

In short, I was entertained, but I still felt that it was a waste of my time and money. However, if I hadn't seen it have felt like I was missing something. As always, it could've been better."

"event","A quirky documentary about a quirky homeless guy who becomes an amateur observer of a flock of wild parrots in San Francisco. I thought it was gonna be real dumb, but it was actually quite touching. My only complaint was the not-so-subtle comparison of these wild birds and the bum's ""freedom"". I shouldn't call the hippie a bum, sorry."

Immediate is a very cool word (without anything in the middle, without medium, nothing mediating). 

I've been reading Borges' non-fiction and I forgot how intoxicating he can be. I read about eight essays today and I think he mentioned Bruno three times. Sweet."

Personal Velocity: Not sure how this chick flick got on my queue, but I loved it.   
     Especially Kyra Sedgwick's story. She has the ugliest part of the movie and    
     maybe she got too into it, but in the little bonus featurette she's the only
     actress that looked pissed off to be involved. Maybe Rebecca Miller's a
     bitch.

I agreed with nearly everything he said and learned a couple things I didn't know. However, I'm still surprised that no one has beaten him to death. 

There were these odd musical interludes of Japanese pop-rock and it turned out that it was the guy who played 'Richard' the crazy con-man in ""Happiness of the Katakuris"". He's a Japanese rockstar as well. It didn't sound bad, it just didn't fit."

"event","I found two separate things today that were kind of linked.<br>
<br>
There's at least one other person on my friend's list who will find the <a href=""http://www.insna.org/"">International Network for Social Network Analysis</a>
interesting. It has journals, software and other info. If I were to
ever become a mathematician this is the sort of thing I would love to
work on.<br>
<br>
Related is the psycho-conservative David Horowitz's website. <a href=""http://discoverthenetwork.org/"">Discover The Network</a>.
If you click on the visual network it uses the same software that I saw
Mario using that showed a visual map of Livejournal connections. It's
actually kind of cool unless you know what it's being used for. David
Horowitz basically thinks that there is no real difference between
liberals, leftists and terrorists. This map purports to show how it is
all linked together. <a href=""http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2005/04/12/horowitz_database/index.html"">You can read all about it at Salon.</a><br>
<br>
David Horowitz is one of those sad stranger-than-fiction people. He
wrote a controversial memoir a couple years ago about his childhood in
an ultra-Marxist-Stalinist family and his disenchantment with the left
during the sixties which included the rape and murder of one of his
friends, possibly by Black Panthers. It sounds like he has completely
become unhinged. What's funny is that in some ways he's more useful to
the left as an object of ridicule than he ever was as an activist.<br>"

"event","Turns out that a lot of the stuff I was feeling physically on Friday was due to going off my meds. I can sort of believe those stories of people who freak out on anti-depressants, but my guess is that it's when they try to go off them themselves or like me are careless of taking them regularly.

So, I'm stuck with them for a while. There are some things that need changing and hopefully I will have the strength to do it soon.

This will sound completely dorky, but one thing I was happy about this weekend was that I actually studied a bit from the math text I've been slogging through on my own. My main goal is to not be so completely ignorant of math when I go back to school. The book is written by Morris Kline who's mentioned in ""A Beautiful Mind"" cause one of the halls is named after him. The book is ""Mathematics for the Non-Mathematician"". One thing I like about it is he shows how the ancients applied math to real world problems like astronomy and art. It's not a large part of the book, but it's enough. He's got another book that goes into greater detail. So maybe if I finish this one I will pick up the other. Gotta love those cheap Dover press books."

I finished the latest issue of The Believer and it didn't dissapoint. Interesting article on Carlos Castaneda. I didn't realize that two of the three women who were his personal associates disappeared after his death. Cult leaders fascinate me. I especially thought it was interesting in how his life sort of mimicked Paul De Man's in that he embraced a philosophy that helped support his deceptive past. In De Man's case it was one where truth was relative and in Castenada's it was one of self-recreation.

Unfortunately I hadn't taken it in over a month and I think it fucked me up. I went to bed at 11 and I woke up around 5:30. I felt like I had a fever, every time I closed my eyes I had lucid dreams (I saw a play about Indians with my family, I owned a crappy club and others I can't recall quite clearly). It was almost pleasant except for the fact that I needed to get out of bed. I called work, left a message and an email. I have no idea what they are going to say. I had dark thoughts again, but was able to look past them, somewhat. I drove to my mother's house to talk to her, but she isn't here. I checked my temperature, but it's only 97.6 so I'm not physically ill although I look very pale. My Cymbalta ran out a couple days ago. Perhaps that's a factor as well. I got a refill today. Besides the chills, the weakness, the dizziness, there is a general sense of loopiness.

refuge to be shocking. Whatever, he's been an ass-tool since the days
of Throbbing Gristle. Psychic TV could be interesting, but GPO just

After I got home at 2 I watched this beautiful movie. I guess you could
defame it by calling it the original 'Natural Born Killers', but it's
good for that. One could suggest that it romanticizes violence, but the
violence here is simple, mean and mindless. They also know that they
are going to pay for their crimes, but they don't care. They could have
been a beautiful couple if he weren't a sociopath and she wasn't a
high-functioning retard. Martin Sheen does indeed look like James Dean
and Sissy Spacek (who I've only known from older roles) is a sexy droll
Lolitaesque teen. The truly breathtaking thing in the movie is the
backdrop of the desert. I wish there had been more of that. I'm also
glad that this movie wasn't digitally remastered (which I think ruins
old films) cause it still has the grainy quality of the original film. <br>
<br>
Maybe I should invent a program that will actually degrade the picture
quality so it looks like you're watching a film instead of a digital
file. That would be cool.<br>
<br>
Out of curiosity I looked up what Terrence Malick has done. He wrote and directed ""Badlands"". Apparently he's working on a screenplay for ""Che"" which is being directed by Steven Soderbergh. Not sure what I think about that."

Drank too much, smoked too much, new favorite cigarette: Nat Sherman's Havana Ovals, music played off better than expected except for Siniestro Total's remake of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" from a Galician point of view, danced with two purty ladies, had drunken thoughts that second purty girl but remembered that I don't actually get along with second purty girl, some Peruvians told me that I should DJ at Guarapo's, Pat a local from Bolivia really digged the music and made him feel homesick and nostalgiac, I kept playing music up until they closed, my MP3 was empty so I just started spinning all my old records and it was fun, I should have done it earlier, besides free drinks I even got some cash, I drove home probably unwisely but safely, woke up after noon and I don't feel bad about it.

I'm going to try a new rule and see if I can stick with. I'm only going to go to the bar once a week. And it has to be a night when I don't work the next day. I am also free from working out or doing anything productive the following day. This will be my Sabbath. 

If I break this rule I will give myself 15 lashes to my naked back.

He called my brother to ask if he could come earlier in the day to lay down some plants he had ordered. My brother told him that they preferred that everybody show up around the same time to make it feel more like a ceremony. He asked him if he understood. My dad said no and hung up on him. My brother called back to ask him why he hung up on him and it became this huge issue. Part of it is that my dad was still upset about not being invited originally to the wedding (it was going to be just the moms because of family drama on the bride's side). It just galls me that he is more concerned with getting these plants in the dirt than the fact that this is my brother's wedding. 

Adam called me up last night to tell me about this. He hasn't had to really deal with this side of my dad. We both have a civil relationship that never succeeds at not being awkward.

I just hope tomorrow goes well. I told Adam to just put off dealing with his anger until next week. My fear is that my dad will just show up anyway with the plants and start digging."

is one in production right now. It's the most laughable gang movie
imaginable, but something about it works. There's a gang of mimes and
another gang of what can only be described as a Goth baseball team. I
have no faith that the book is any better than the movie, but I was
curious about a couple things: there were some confused historical
allusions that went nowhere: The gang leader killed is Cyrus, the
distance according to the trailer (as I heard it) that The Warriors had
to travel home was 26 miles, he final stand off is at the beach which
is similar to the battle of Thermopylae, the wannabe warlord was named
Ajax. I am sure I am reading to much into this silly movie. <br>

So we'll see if I ever hear from her. She is totally cool.

Sorry to all the other cool people I hung with tonight, but I gotta get to bed."

"event","Today I spent learning about ""Customer Centered Service Excellence"". The basic model is ""Focus, Discover, Deliver, Invite, Guarantee"". I kept thinking of ways that it could apply to dating to keep myself from getting bored. The intricacies and details of my job's culture are mind-numbingly boring so I won't regale you with them here. 

Afterwards we all met at Champps at Pentagon Row. This was there idea of a good place to go for good food. I thought I was boring, actually I am, but these people are even more boring, but they think they're fascinating at the same time. One of them did not know what hefeweissen was. It shouldn't have, but that made me very very sad. I had to endure some inane conversation, but I got a free meal out of it. I will endure anything for a free meal, especially these days.

Afterwards I went to the Hut. There were some bands playing and all the regulars were up the street at IOTA to watch Gleek play so I had one beer and left. The only highlight was that I ran into Travis Morrison who I've been introduced to a couple times by a couple friends. I'm always amazed that he vaguely remembers who I am. Maybe he really is a mental giant. And as Ivy put it, I slept with him one person removed, but he doesn't know or remembers that. Besides I wore a condom so does that even count?

Some stuff I forgot before. On my trip to Jersey I listened to the much hyped a couple years back ""Running With Scissors"" by Augusten Burroughs. Has David Sedaris started a cottage industry of eccentric gay guys with slightly disturbing personal stories that are ultimately devoid of all meaning or relevance? Admittedly, there is about 10% of each of these guys I find hilarious, but that doesn't make up for the time wasted. The real problem with Burroughs's book that they are based on teenage journal writings that he was too lazy to improve upon so they read exactly as what they are, immature observations free of any context. As someone who was mentally-ill as a youngster I identified with a lot of it, but it still wasn't enough.

I'm excited that there is a collection of newly translated essays by W.G. Sebald. Discovering him reaffirmed that literature is not dead."

"event","I called out sick today. My boss didn't sound like he believed me and I didn't believe myself either. I don't care. I felt sick. I slept for several hours. I'm still not dressed. I guess this is depression, but I'm not sure. Not sure why I didn't want to go into work today. One, there are too many working today. Two, I don't know what two is.

There really is a lot I should be taking care of, but I don't feel like doing that either. There are numerous doctor bills to sort through and other shit.

I think work will be fine about it. I still got sick hours and nothing's hanging. They can kiss my ass."

"event","Karen and I did not make it to the Diane Arbus exhibit. Instead we drove to Hoboken for the hell of it. We walked around, but a lot of the boutiques were closed for Easter. We did go into a little art shop where Karen fell in love with an old medicine chest transformed into a light up mirror with an orchid design. We had coffee and then played paperrockscissor to determine if she would actually buy it or not. We played several times until she finally beat me. It was a foregone conclusion that she was going to buy it. I just hope she doesn't regret it. CAREFUL HANGING IT UP! 

It freaked her out that I was able to consistently beat her at paperrockscissor cause her patterns were sort of predictable. Once I pointed out what I was doing she was able to counter and the game went back to being fairly random."

"event","Just in case. I will not be going to see ""River and Tides today."" I will catch it some other time. Too much to do today.

Stacey inadvertently gave me my halloween costume for next year. I was saying how work gave me a clothing allowance and how I bought multiple mormon-like outfits. She said all I need is a bicycle helmet. A backpack and a copy of ""The Book of Mormon"" and I'll be set!

Last night some friends came out to the Hut and it was good. Eran was sorely missed however.

I may have mentioned before my excitement at Karen Armstrong's mention of mnemonics in her bio of the Buddha, but I forgot to mention how she talks about the practice of animal sacrifice in early Vedic culture. What she doesn't mention is what a contentious issue this is. It reminded me of a review I read for a book called ""Holy Cow"" by an Indian historian about animal sacrifice and specifically about cattle and the eating of beef. His life has been threatened several times by Hindu extremists. It's hard to imagine such a pantheistic religion as having extremists, but they do.

""Q"" by Luther Blisset is turning out to be quite enjoyable. It's a very graphic portrayal of the time around the reformation. I'm unsure however what's fact and fiction as they mix both.

This weekend I'm going up to Jersey to see Karen. There's something at the Met she wants to check out.

Last night I had dinner with my mother. She's becoming more open about her problems. We had a good conversation about her depression, work, family issues, but I felt bad because I zoned out a couple times. She has a way of talking too much that makes me lose focus on what she's saying. Kind of like my lj entries."

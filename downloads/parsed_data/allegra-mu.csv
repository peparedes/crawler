"event","<lj-cut text=""You can't expect her to know her way around /that/ well yet..."">Steven has had a full day, taking Allegra everywhere she needed to go and answering her questions all day. Not that he minded it, but it was exhausting in the way anything different from routine can get. Once he got her set up in her own room and resting, he went for a drink, then went to bed himself. He took off the holoemitter, as he usually does, and laid it beside his alarm clock. Then it was off to slumber-ville for the big guy.

Not that Allegra stayed in her room. There was just too much to do and see out there. She wandered the school until she found the kitchen, meeting Jubilee and Logan, eating ice cream.. at least until she discovered the concept of food combining.. and just how poorly it could go sometimes. Saying goodnight to her newest acquaintances, she had intended to go back to her room, but it took her forever just to find the right general area, and then she found herself walking back down the hallway towards Steven's room. Pausing outside his door, she frowns. This isn't right. Her room is around here somewhere, but.. Finally she simply shakes her head. Steven will know where she should go. Without giving it another moment's thought, she opens the door and pads inside. It takes her eyes a moment to adjust to the dark, and even then she can't see anything more than a vague lump in the bed. Smiling, she climbs up onto the bed, kneeling beside him, and reaches out to nudge his shoulder. ""Steven?""

Steven isn't the lightest of sleepers, but his name, combined with someone touching him pokes through. He jerks away from the poke, one large arm coming up like he's going to swing at whatever it was before the voice finally sinks in and he holds himself back from finishing the swing. ""Huh?"" he says with the incredible intellect of the half asleep. ""Whozzat? Leggy?""

""Hello Steven,"" Allegra chirps, tugging on his upper arm. ""Steven, I can't find my room. OH! And I met Jubilee. She talks funny and it is hard to understand her but she seems nice. And Logan. He's nice too, but he barely talks at all, he just watches Jubilee all the time. And then I was going to go back to my room and sleep but I got lost and found your room instead."" Running out of breath, she bounces lightly on the bed, peering down at him in the dim light. ""You look..different..""

Steven nods his head and reaches for the lamp. ""Light."" he warns, before turning it on to give a clearer view of his 'uniform'. The gloves he wears might look familiar, from that three fingered one he picked up in the park. The rest should be new though. It matches at least. All blue or navy, except for a golden X logo with a stylized sword through it. ""Remember me telling ya I looked different without my gizmo?""

Allegra squirms around until she's sitting cross-legged on the mattress. She gives him the same curious once-over she's given everyone else she's met, looking him over from head to toe. ""Why do you dress like that?"" she asks, reaching out to touch his shoulder, to make certain that it really is cloth that she's looking at, and not some odd colored skin. ""And why do you.. oh, yes. Because other people might not like it. They're not very smart, those other people, are they?""

Steven nods. ""Exactly. If I look really different, some people will get angry or scared. It's worse if I peel outta this thing, but I don't do that much. It ain't safe."" He shifts with a soft grunt of effort to a sitting position. ""Remember what I told ya about my not payin' attention? I change anythin' I touch 'cept for this outfit, so I gotta wear it to keep from changin' things.""

""What do you look like under it?"" Allegra asks curiously. ""What's the uniform made out of? How come you don't change it if you change everything else."" Someone needs to teach this girl to slow down. ""I think people out there are just silly. We don't care what they look like, why should they care what -we- look like?""

Steven chuckles and grins. ""Leggy, darlin'. You're gonna make some teacher real happy, and the rest miserable. I dunno why they're like that. Scared is the best reason I can think of. People have a habit of lashin' out when somethin' scares them. It ain't good, but it happens. I can't change this outfit 'cause it was made by a fella back home so it wouldn't change. I ain't got a clue what he made it from. Rawhide and injun magic for all I know."" He carefully swings his legs out from the bed so he can stand. ""As for what I look like, I can show ya if ya want. It ain't easy to describe.""

Allegra shifts around to face him, her legs dangling off the bed. ""Okay,"" she says, nodding happily. ""I don't know why anybody would be scared of you, Steven. You're nice. I'm not scared of you."" Of course, she hasn't met anything yet that does scare her. She doesn't like pain, but she hasn't been hurt badly enough to fear it yet. She's not certain about Tigra. She's nice, but she also does lots of poking and sticking with needles, and Allegra's not real sure about that either. But not frightened. ""I think.. rawhide is like skin, isn't it?"" And then she pales, understanding suddenly where it has to come from. ""That's /awful/! Why would anyone take someone's skin off?""

Steven shakes his head. ""It ain't like person skin. It's an Indian thing. They kill an animal, they use it all. Bone tools. Meat for cookin'. The skin for rawhide or leather. There ain't no waste, ya see? Besides, I don't think it really is that. I was just makin' a guess.""

Allegra wrinkles her nose, still looking disgusted. ""I guess.."" she says doubtfully, and then shrugs. ""If you say it's okay, Steven, then I believe you."" And from the look on her face and the tone of her voice, it really is that easy. Her expression clears as she watches him. ""So.. what do you look like without that on? I don't see any buttons or zippers.. how do you take it off?""

Steven stands and slips his thick fingers into the well hidden seams of the outfit, removing first gloves, then top and mask. ""It acts more like spandex than rawhide anyway. I just hate imagining myself in overgrown speedoes."" He turns slowly to face her once the top half is removed, but only after saying, ""And if I bother ya too much, I don't mind wearin' the emitter. I don't even like lookin' at myself anymore.""

For once, Allegra is quiet. Remaining silent for several moments, she looks Steven over, her expression never changing. Finally, she stands up, reaching out to touch his arm, if he allows it. Apparently forgotten is the caution about how easily he can change things. ""Why would it bother me, Steven?"" she asks finally, tilting her head to look up at him. There's no hint in her face that she finds his appearance disturbing or repellant. ""Why don't you like looking at yourself? I don't understand..""

Steven was a little too busy with his personal musing to notice her reaching for him as she was asking her questions. ""Where I'm from, they put stuff in the water to keep mutants from showin' their powers. I looked like everybody else, until I got it cleared outta my..."" and that's when he realizes she's there. Not from feeling her, but from finally seeing her there. He jerks away suddenly. ""Don't touch me!"" Not that it isn't already too late by the time he shouts and moves. The brilliant orange, often called ten mile orange, was already covering her palm and starting over the tops of her fingers before he noticed. ""Leggy. Don't _EVER_ touch me directly like that. I could hurt you. Badly.""

Allegra doesn't appear to notice the change to her hand. Before he's even done talking she's skittered away from him, crouching in the corner of the room with her arms hiding her face. ""I'm sorry!"" she whispers, over and over. ""I didn't mean to. I won't ever ever again. I'm sorry."" Even now, she doesn't sound frightened, exactly. Tears are streaming down her cheeks, her entire posture suggesting abject regret. ""Please Steven. I'll be good. Don't be angry at me.""

Steven's tone softens at her reaction and he starts to follow her to the corner, stopping a few steps away to avoid accidental contact. ""I'm not angry, Leggy. You scared me. Remember what happened at the Carousel? I could do that, or worse."" He glances around, finally setting his eyes on the can from his beer. ""You don't know what all I do yet. He reaches out to pick up the can and a bright green floods down the surface of it as he does. ""That's easy."" As he speaks, it turns to glass. ""That's a little harder.""

Blinking away her tears, Allegra looks up, her lips trembling into a hesitant smile. ""You aren't angry with me?"" she asks quietly. ""I.. I didn't mean to do anything wrong, Steven. I just wanted to see what your skin felt like. It looks so pretty and shimmery.."" Pushing herself up off the floor, she finally catches sight of her hands and giggles. ""Look! I'm orange!""

Steven licks his lips and nods as the glass 'can' shifts to an almost matching orange. ""It'll wear off in a few hours and you'll be back to normal. Don't wo..."" he chuckles at himself slightly. Like she worries about _anything_. ""Anyway, keep watchin'. I'll show ya one of the things ya don't know I can do."" As he speaks, he shifts the glass to his palm and it just starts melting away, disappearing from the point of contact slowly.

Allegra stares, her eyes widening. ""Where is it going?"" she asks, reaching out to touch it, and then remembering his earlier reaction and pulling her hand back. ""Steven.. can't you ever touch anyone?""Her expression softens as she looks up at him. ""That must hurt. To never touch..""

Steven shakes his head at her. ""Not anymore. Not without my gloves. I can't turn it off. All I can do is try to keep it doing what I want it to, but if I don't think about it..."" he gestures at the handprints on the walls and drawers. ""As for where it's goin'... it's kinda hard to explain. Do ya know about molecules?""

Allegra frowns. ""I know the word.."" she says softly. ""But it does not make sense.. I don't understand it. Not like hot and cold and the others."" Frowning, she watches Steven for a moment. ""But you.. can keep from doing it when you concentrate? But you can't concentrate all the time.."" She sighs. ""I am sorry, Steven. I don't like it when you hurt. Here.."" And she straightens out of her crouch, walking towards him. ""You can concentrate. Very hard, for a little while.."" she says quietly, and then steps closer, to try and hug him. She reaches hesitantly, not wanting him angry at her again, but with no fear at all for herself.

Steven nods, looking at her carefully and trying to lock in her skin tones in mind before she can touch him. It's not perfect, but he can get close. As she wraps her arms around him, he stands stiffly, keeping as total control as he can focus on. It's going to be hard on her shirt, but she shouldn't show much difference in her colors. And where the hand was hours, the shirt will be days.

Allegra relaxes at the nod, her arms sliding around his massive form. She can't quite get her hands to meet around him, she's too small, and he's too big, but she squeezes him tightly, resting her cheek against his for a moment. The shirt slowly shifts, turning as bright an orange as her palms, but she doesn't notice, and wouldn't care if she did. She hugs him for another moment, her palms flat against his back, feeling the texture of his skin, and then steps back, her face lighting with a brilliant smile. ""See?""

Steven nods and smiles slightly. ""Thanks. That meant a lot."" He reaches for his top once again. ""But... I guess we should get ya to your room."" No need to tell her in some ways it was worse. His skin is so hard he barely felt her at all.

With Steven safely dressed, Allegra allows herself to be led back to her room. At her door, she pauses to hug him once more, before opening her door. ""I'll see you in the morning!"" she promises, and then flushes, remembering the mess she'd left in the kitchen. ""And I'll help you get the kitchen cleaned up and make breakfast! Promise!""

Steven starts to ask, then just shakes his head. Oh god. What did she do? ""Thanks. I appreciate it.""

Allegra smiles widely, and then steps into her room, shutting the door and leaving poor Steven out there to contemplate what she's been up to. It's not that bad, really. Just ice cream all over the counter, with a big bowl full of the stuff melting on the table. Ignore the cheese and olives floating in it, please. Allegra's trying really hard not to even think about it.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Poor Jubilee.. if she had any idea what she was getting herself into..."">Steven had shown her the kitchen earlier, letting her poke around in it while he'd prepared dinner for the students. After explaining to her not to touch the burners, or the knives, or the food processor, along with a rather lengthy list of other kitchen gadgets, he'd told her that she could come in anytime she was hungry. Everyone else did. Of course, he didn't tell everyone else this with such a look of strain. Allegra had immediately promised to be good. And she /was/ trying. Of course, she was also hungry. Remembering Steven's instructions, she'd left the stove alone, and the knives. And the food processor. Standing up at the kitchen counter, she's got a HUGE bowl out, and is in the process of filling it. She'd started with ice cream, and now she was adding toppings, tasting things in the fridge and sprinkling them over the ice cream whenever she found something she liked. Chocolate. Whipped cream. Olives. Shredded mozzarella. Ooooh! Cherries! They're pretty, and they taste /so/ good. Lots of those. Hmmm.. what else?

That was certainly an interesting walk home. Guys with flaming swords aside, Jubilee's glad to be at Avalon for her 'dinner', which, as usual, is past the school kids' bedtimes. She's dragged in around nine thirty tonight, even later than usual, and her face lights up when she sees the fridge. She's still moving carefully, and the right side of her face is still light blue, but she's hungry, dangit. ""Hiya,"" she says cheerfully, halfway to the food before she realizes there's someone else there.

Glancing up at the newcomer, Allegra smiles happily. ""Hello. Would you like some ice cream?"" she asks, stepping back from the counter so that the other girl can see the bowl. ""I do not mind if you would like some of mine, or I could fix you a bowl for yourself."" Allegra eyes Jubilee curiously, her gaze travelling over the other girl. She doesn't react at all to the bruising, though, her gaze travelling as easily over that as it does the rest. ""My name is Allegra,"" is offered, almost as an afterthought.

""Ya know, ice cream sounds great,"" Jubilee starts to grin, then half-winces. That still hurts. ""Though,"" she says peering at the bowl, ""I kinda want it without th' cheese an' olives,"" she says good naturedly, a friendly laugh in her voice. ""I'm Jubilee. Ya new here?""

Once Jubilee enters the building it doesn't take a Wolverine to catch her scent (pleasant). Okay, so it does. A few moments after Jubilee arrives in the kitchen, heavy footsteps can be heard coming from the direction of the men's hallway. A warning to anyone even thinking about touching his stash of brew. The footsteps grow louder until the owner of those heavy feet trudges into the kitchen. A short but bulky man coated with hair and a smug expression on his face. His bushy eyebrows arch slightly as his feral eyes immediately find Jubilee, ""Hey darlin'."" He moves across the kitchen towards the fridge as his eyes glance at Allegra. The ancient man offers the girl a nod before he tugs the fridge open and bends over, almost disappearing in it as he fishes for a bottle of beer.

Picking up the bowl of ice cream, Allegra carries it over to the table and sets it down. She's got a finger half in the goopy mess when she remembers Steven's admonishment about silverware. Sucking the mess off of her finger, all she can do is nod in Jubilee's direction while she opens the drawer, looking for a spoon. Oooh.. what's. No. Not supposed to touch the pointy things. But Steven didn't say she couldn't touch the swirly pointed things. Lifting up a corkscrew, she pulls her finger from her mouth, turning the implement in her fingers, her expression openly curious.

Jubilee slips over to the fridge, too, wedging herself in beside Logan to grab a beer and a couple of pre-made hotdogs she stashed behind the Beer-That-Only-She-Dared-Violate. She straightens up slowly with a grimace and a soft curse under her breath. Time for ibuprofin, since the Doc took her good stuff away yesterday. She turns to go for the medicine when she sees Allegra and the corkscrew. ""Umm, that's f' openin' wine with, an' I don't think we've got any of that. Why don'tcha graba spoon, they're best for ice cream.""

The Canuck moves his broad self out of the way to let the petite young woman infringe on his beer stash. After she takes a beer and the hotdogs, he takes a bottle for himself and pulls out of the fridge. Turning around, he kicks the fridge door shut and steps over to the counter and leans back against it, twisting the cap off. He tosses the cap into the trash and takes a swig of his beer, folding his arms across his chest.

Distracted, it takes Allegra a moment to process what Jubilee has said.. and another moment to decipher it. ""Ohh.. a corkscrew. Thank you,"" she says politely, putting it away and bringing out a spoon. Settling down at the table, she watches Logan curiously for a moment, and then forgets him for food. Not, however, before she remembers her manners enough to answer Jubilee's earlier question. ""Yes. Steven brought me here last night, and this morning Ororo said that I could stay and go to school here.""

Jubilee sees the girl's stare at Logan and half-grins as she digs through a cabinet for ibuprofin. ""That's Logan, don' worry if he doesn't say much, he's grouchy,"" she says, giggling to herself, ""'cause I keep takin' his beer, an' now I can do it 'gain since I'm off my meds."" Which is a toss up: good because she can have a beer with her hotdogs, bad because she hurts. ""An' they're big on th' whole school thing. Giveya somethin' ta do, anyway.""

The Wolverine's expression doesn't change much as Jubilee introduces him and his personality. His head does turn towards Jubilee long enough for his lips to curl into a slight grin before it fades again and he idly glances back towards the new girl. He resumes his role as the resident brooder, taking another long drink of beer. He silently observes Allegra every now and then, but for the most part his eyes follow Jubilee as she moves about the kitchen.

Glancing over at Logan again, Allegra smiles at him before turning back to Jubilee. ""I'm not worried,"" she reassures. ""Steven told me that everyone here is nice, so I don't have to worry."" Digging her spoon into the ice cream, she takes a big bite. Vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, and an olive. Hey.. it all tasted good separately. Swallowing, she makes a face. Somehow, it doesn't quite work together though. ""Ororo said that I would go to school with other kids. I.. there is a lot that I need to learn.""

Jubilee nods, taking a big bite out of a hotdog. She washes it down with three little pink pills and a swig of beer, then says, ""Yeah, there're lotsa kids here, an' they'll keepya learnin' stuff. Dunno, they might even make it fun!"" Another big grin and she sort of stiffly walks back over to the counter by the fridge and determinedly hops onto it, breathing another curse at the pain as she does so.

The Canuck tilts his beer up and pours the rest of the brew down his throat before emitting a satisfied 'ah' sound, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. He steps across th kitchen and tosses the bottle into the trash. Turning, his feral eyes shift towards Jubilee and he nods in her direction, ""Hope yer feelin' better darlin'."" His face softens slightly as he offers her a slight smile, ""Give me a yell later."" He turns and trudges out of the kitchen just as heavily as he came.

Shoving aside her ice cream, appetite gone as quickly as it came on, Allegra stands up. ""I am.. sleepy.."" she says. Her words sound odd. There's no accent, nothing that easy to put a finger on, but much of the time there's an edge of uncertainty around them, as though she's not quite certain she's saying the right thing. ""I think I will find my room, and go to sleep. It was nice meeting you and Logan.""

""'kay!"" Jubilee calls after Logan. She stays sitting on the counter one hotdog mostly gone, the other sitting next to her. ""An', I'll seeya 'round, 'kay?"" She lifts a hand to wave to the oth

Steven has had a busy morning, and he's only been up a short time. He's had to explain quite a few things to Allegra already and he knows more are coming. He's not complaining so much as beginning to realize what a task it's going to be to get her used to the place. Oh well. First things first. He makes a couple of calls to find out if 'Ro is in the office or a class, then heads to meet her and introduce Allegra. Help will be nice. Before knocking on the office door, he turns to Allegra with a smile. ""Remember, Ororo's really nice and you can trust her. I do.""

Tailing after Steven, Allegra follows him to the office quite willingly, though there are more than a few pauses and stops along the way. Easily distracted, Allegra wanders away every opportunity that she gets, pausing to look at pictures and plants, people, giggling at the water fountain and splashing water everywhere. Eventually, though, they do reach the office. ""I'll be good, Steven. I promise,"" Allegra hastens to assure.

Back in New York and back to business, it would seem, for Ororo Munroe. Since her return, things had been relatively quiet. She had kept pretty much to herself, allowing those who needed to know to be aware of her return while avoiding more public venues. There just seemed to be something about the girl, something different... something that had not been there before she had left, or something that was no longer present in the now aloof way she carried herself. A sort of regal grace enveloped the white haired teen like a mantle; or wall of protection. No longer did she seem one in mourning... or, anything else, for that matter. This morning had found the young weather witch without classes, though not for the reasons of cancellation; she chose not to go, but to devote her days after the trip to catching up on paperwork for Tigra and Rachel to peruse and sign. The call from Margie had drawn her from going over the January enrollment in Avalon, checking to see who needed standard classes and who required their more specialized, powered, teachings. ""Send them in."" She murmured into the intercom, glancing up at the knock on the door, and calling out herself. ""Please, enter."" Pushing to her feet, the teen reaches idly to tuck a strand of her short, white, hair behind her ear; forgetting that it was no longer the length to need it.

Steven swings the door open just enough to poke his head in, with his usual good humor. ""Heya' 'Ro. Got a minute? I got an interesting one for ya."" Then, he swings the door the rest of the way open and waves Allegra through. ""I'd like ya to meet Allegra. Leggy, this is Ororo."" He steps through once Allegra has had her chance. ""She was in the park. Naked. In the snow. I brought her home to see if we could maybe..."" He trails off, running a hand over his bald head like he needed to wipe nervous sweat off it.

Allegra comes into the room, but she remains close to Steven, hovering around him as she watches Ororo with open curiosity. ""Steven stopped the cold, and Leif gave me clothes,"" she informs the Headmistress solemnly, and then smiles, her face lighting up as she tugs at the bottom of her shirt. ""I told Steven I wasn't cold this morning, but he says you have to wear clothes around other people."" Poor Steven.

The smile of greeting that touches Ororo's face at the sight of her friend and his companion wavers slightly, replaced by a look of humorous confusion. Naked in the park was not one of the things that the teen would have remarked as unusual, even in the snow. Surely if it did not bother her, there must be others about who had the same sorts of mutation; if the girl were a mutant at all. Laughing softly at Allegra's recount, the teen headmistress nods. ""I have been told much the same."" She assures. ""It is a pleasure to meet you... Allegra. I am Ororo."" Moving around the desk, her jeans and oversized shirt far from what one might expect an official to wear, teen or no, she offers her hand to the younger girl. ""Welcome to Avalon."" That Steven 'stopped' the cold came as no surprise to the young weather witch; there was much about the large guardian that she had yet to learn, and she vaguely recalled Leif from her earlier days. ""Are you... gifted as well, Miss Allegra?"" Ororo asks softly, her head canting slightly to the side, her smile encouraging.

See what he's had to deal with? A boss that skinny dips still and finding strange women nude in New York weather. Why couldn't this have happened to Steven before he became attached? Anyway, back to the here and now. ""There was a flash out by the Carousel, and then I saw her over by it. By the time I realized what was up, it was a little late to turn the emitter off, and I had to help..."" Yep. He used powers in his 'street clothes'. In public. Good thing it was late and a lot of people didn't get to see. He waits to let Allegra answer 'Ro's question before adding anything more. No need to make it too confusing.

Allegra tilts her head at Ororo's question, a look of confusion passing over her face. Turning slightly, she glances at Steven, ""Gifted?"" she echoes, before looking back at Ororo. ""I.. Leif gave me the clothes. Those are gifts, yes? And Steven gave me shoes, but they turned back into snow and melted. I forgot.. I'm sorry if the floor got wet. I will clean it up. I promise."" Increasingly nervous, the girl shifts from foot to foot, taking an instinctive step back towards Steven.

Blue eyes dart back to Steven as more and more of the puzzle begins to piece together. A flash in the park? ""Crystal?"" Ororo murmurs in the man's direction, delicately sculpted eyebrows arching in question before the returns her gaze, and her smile, to the younger girl. The child Goddess would not berated the older man for his use of powers out of uniform, and in public. She was trying to be a good leader and that involved allowing people to use their better judgments; they knew self and ability best. ""Those are lovely gifts, indeed."" She assures Allegra, dropping her hand to the her sides. ""You have no need to apologize or clean here."" She would leave the question of 'gifted' for the moment, the young girl seemed nervous enough. ""Has Steven told you what Avalon is? Who our school caters to?""

Steven flashes a grin toward his newest companion. ""She means like the mutant stuff we talked about last night."" he offers in additional explanation, before shrugging toward 'Ro about the crystal and offering a quick ""I haven't had time to tell her a lot, and wasn't sure how much you'd wanna fill in yourself.""

Allegra nods, her expression clearing. Turning back to Ororo she shakes her head slowly. ""I do not believe I am a mutant. I don't think that I am, at least. I have.. a great deal to learn, I know, and I have not had very much time to figure everything out. But I just don't know.  I know that this is a school, and Steven said that you helped people who were different.  Am I different?"" That is more to Steven, as she flashes another glance towards him. ""I have only met my Father, and then Leif and Steven, and now you.. And everyone is different. How do you choose who to help?""

Ororo offers a soft laugh as she moves again behind the desk, her slender hand motioning to the two guest chairs as she reseats herself and moves the attendance papers to the side. ""We help those who need it, powered or not."" Well, it was a little more than that, though only due to the fact that about as many who welcome their help are about as many as those who refuse... or worse, wish to do nothing but harm. ""If I may, Miss Allegra, how old are you? Where is your father?"" Pulling open one of the side drawers, the teen begins to create a file for their newest arrival. If Benny's expression was any indication, they were about to have a new resident at Avalon. ""Are you interested in learning?""

Steven takes his usual seat in here. Reinforced, of course. Even before Allegra answers he pipes up. ""She don't know where she's from, and she don't remember seeing one of them red crystals, but,"" he again shrugs slightly as he speaks, ""...it sure looked like she touched one to me."" He glances over to Allegra ""Do ya remember _who_ your daddy was?""

Following Steven's lead, Allegra sits down in the other chair, folding her hands in her lap. ""I.."" she starts, and then stops, shifting in her seat. ""I don't know how old I am.."" she finishes in a small voice. ""I remember just before I was in the park, I woke up. And my father was there. It was a small room, like this one. With a desk and bookcases. And there were crystals. And lines on the floor. And candles. I don't know where the room was. I just woke up there, then everything changed."" Puzzled, she looks at Steven. ""He's my father."" Duh.

Turning a speculative gaze to the young girl, Ororo tries to read what she could of her expression, or her body language, before her eyebrows seem to race up the short space of her forehead. She was no expert, not in the least, but Allegra's description of her previous surroundings tugged the teen's mind toward her reading in Selene's library; she would have to remember to inquire later... much later, as she was still avoiding the mansion as much as possible. ""It is alright. I can not hazard what that might have been, but you are safe and amongst those who would care for you,"" Here, the teen pauses to look up affectionately toward Steven, her meaning there clear, ""if you would allow it."" Glancing down, Ororo makes a notation or two on the admissions page; she would need something for the accountants if she planned to offer another scholarship. Allegra... Alchem, seemed like a fair sir name; it could be changed if the young girl was displeased with it. Age: fifteen. ""If you care to, we can assign a tutor to you until you are comfortable? Then you may attend classes with others of your age."" She offers with a gentle smile.

Steven chuckles and gives 'Ro a 'see what she does?' look. ""I meant, do ya know his name? It might help us figure out where ya came from."" Not that he expects it to, but you never know. Maybe the guy's name was Merlin or something. ""Do ya remember anything at all from before ya woke up there?"" He turns toward 'Ro then and softly adds ""I'll help pay for some more clothes and shoes for her, but I ain't got a clue of what she'll need.""

Allegra tries. She really does, her brow wrinkling with the effort, but finally she just shakes her head. ""I'm sorry, Steven,"" she whispers, sounding absolutely devastating at the perceived failure. ""I don't know what my father's name is. I can't remember what happened before I woke up. I just woke up. And he said my name, and then I was here."" Crestfallen, she shrinks into her chair, her lips trembling.

Ororo glances quickly at Steven, her eyes widening slightly, before quickly standing and moving around the desk to the girl, her grace as unconscious as her speed. ""It is alright, Allegra. If you do not recall, it is fine. You are amongst friends, now, who care for you."" Leaning back to rest, still standing, against the edge of the desk, the teen adds to Steven, ""Perhaps ask Jubilation if she can take Allegra to the store. We have scholarship enough to offer her a place. Spend on gifts, if you wish."" The sparkle was back in Ororo's blue eyes; even if it was but a shadow of what it had been, as she teases the older man amicably.

Steven reaches over to give Allegra's arm a reassuring pat. ""It's alright. Ya tried."" Then he turns back to 'Ro as he stands up. ""I'm gonna take her to the Medlab for a physical. See if maybe she's gotta reason for the amnesia."" He glances to Allegra for just a moment before continuing. ""And I'll see about a room and stuff too. Then we can worry about the shoppin' trip. Maybe ya won't be busy and ya could join us."" Translation: I know you've got good taste.

That easily, Allegra brightens, the shadows vanishing from her face as she straightens in her chair. Smiling happily, she reaches over to hold Steven's arm. ""I will try to remember, Steven. I will try very hard. But it is all blank there."" Glancing at Ororo, she nods at the other woman. ""I do want to learn, ma'am. I promise you, if you let me stay I will work very hard to learn. I won't be any trouble. I will do what I'm told. I promise."" All of this is offered with the solemnity of a sworn oath, Allegra's eyes seeking out Ororo's.

Ororo offers Allegra a warm smile. ""A better promise I have never heard."" She ways warmly, standing again. ""Welcome to Avalon, Allegra. I hope it finds as great a place in your heart as it has in mine."" Nodding to Steven, the teen continues, ""A room in Venus hall. I believe the one across from my own is free, and have it decorated as she pleases."" Satisfied, Ororo moves back to the business end of the desk to sit down again; she wanted to get this paperwork finished as soon as possible so that the young girl could begin either anew, or on the path to remembering. ""Steven... Thank you. You have done very well."" It seemed strange coming from someone who could have, possibly, have been his daughter but as his leader and 'boss', it might have been just... right.

Steven grins. ""Thanks, 'Ro."" he says as he turns toward the door. ""Come on, Leggy. I'll show ya some more of the place and get ya a room. And don't worry about the docs. They're careful, even the fuzzy one. I'm hoping she'll be there when we get there. You'll like Tigger."" He waves to 'Ro as he opens the door to head out. ""Don't forget the shoppin' trip."" he tells her, as if she had agreed to go.

Standing up, Allegra flashes Ororo another smile. ""Thank you, ma'am,"" she says, waving as she joins Steven at the door. ""Why do I need to see a doctor?"" Can be heard as they vanish through it. ""I'm not hurt. Oooh! What's that..come on! Let's go look..hey..can I see.."" And they're off. And from the sounds of it, it's going to be a very long morning for the school chef"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Welcome to New York City...."">
Boy. What a night. Long workout in the Danger Room to try and get his powers under better control, then a walk to ease the kinks from the workout and to get a drink. Doesn't it figure that a light snow would start while he's drinking so he ends up looking totally underdressed as he walks back? It wasn't so bad in the last of the daylight before the clouds blew in but now... There isn't a lot he can do about it though. The holoemitter only has one setting. If anyone asks, he'll claim it's training for the Polar Bear Club.

Probably that last drink at Bordertown was not a good idea, as now Leif is trying to make it back home in the dark and the snow. He's got a big coat over his usual attire and is hauling a metal easel over his shoulder, whistling cheerfully as he walks home. After all, it's only below freezing-- perfect night for a midnight stroll. WHY hadn't he taken the SUBWAY?! Why?!

A moment ago.. not even a moment, really. So little time that it takes a moment for her mind to catch up with what her senses are telling her. A faint flash of light, more than could be caused by the streetlights, rolls over the snow, catching the flakes in the air and making them shimmer, as a lone figure appears in the shadow of the carousel. She's sprawled in the snow, caught in the process of lifting herself up from the ground, her weight resting upon her palms as her knees begin to draw up. And then she simply stops, trembling as the cold wind blows over her, tangling snowflakes in her long, dark brown hair. The shadow of the carousel helps to hide the fact that she's wearing nothing, her too pale skin gleaming faintly where hair and shadow do not cover it.

Steven starts at the light, turning his head to find what it was and settling his eyes on the girl by the carousel. ""Hey!"" he calls as he turns that way. ""You all right?"" Stupid question, but someone has to ask it, right? As he starts over toward her his eyes slowly widen. Wait? Is she? Yep. And he though he was underdressed. Without glancing to see if anyone catches him, he pulls a glove from the costume he hides under his holo image and starts rushing toward the girl. Well rushing for him anyway. It's more of a graceless lumber.

Leif wouldn't've noticed the girl, but the shout catches his attention, and the running. He turns around to look, his eyes narrowing as he tries to see into the dark. His jaw drops open as he catches sight of the dimly lit and _naked_ girl. Well, there's something you don't see every day. Cold, naked girl in the snow. Leif to the rescue, of course. He rushes over, careful with the easel. ""Hey! You look a little cold, sweetheart."" he says as he puts the aluminum frame down and begins to shrug out of his coat.

Allegra is cold. Her eyes widen as yet another word falls into place for her. Cold. At the moment, though, she's got her hand out, cupped to catch some of the snow. Watching it melt against her skin, she tilts her head as Leif and Steven approach, her eyes narrowing. ""Where is my father?"" And then, just as quickly, she turns her attention back to the snow. As her hand chills enough that it doesn't melt right away, a small pile of flakes begins to grow in the center of her palm. ""Snow..? Frozen water. It falls from the sky. Why?""

Steven glances at the other guy when he hears the voice, then quickly turns away to try and keep his features from being easily noticed. ""Talk to her pal."" he says with a distinct southern accent. ""See if you can find out anything. I'll work on keeping her warm."" And with that, he reaches for the carousel with the hand he ungloved under the mask of the holo and starts focusing on heat, agitating the structure of the item to create an effective heater. ""Keep her close to this thing. It'll be warm soon and it'll keep the wind off."" What she's asked isn't really listened to beyond realizing that it sounds like she's incoherent.

Leif nods to the other man and tries to catch the girl's eyes, to get her to face him. ""Hey, sweetheart, snow's falling because it's cold. We're going to try and get you warmed up a bit, but can you tell me your name? Or where you're from? Or even if you can hear me?"" He's out of his jacket and moves to drape it around her shoulders gently.

""Allegra."" She responds simply, dropping the snow out of her hand. Fingering the jacket, she looks up at Leif, ""I am from.."" And then she stops, her brow wrinkling. ""I am Allegra. My father brought me... where is my father?"" Shaking her head, she reaches back for the Carousel, trying to climb to her feet. ""Where am I?""

A carousel that should be much warmer already when she touches it. Not blistering hot, but noticeable anyway. The snow on it is starting to melt quickly as Steven's touch works it wonders on the solid object. ""Take it easy, darlin'."" Says the big man as he tucks his head down to block his face with his arm. ""We'll help ya find him. Won't we pal?""

""Yeah, sure."" Leif agrees, reaching out to steady the girl, if she'll let him. ""Look, I'm Leif, and you're in Central Park, in New York City."" New York. America. Earth. Who knows if any of those places will ring a bell, but he figures he might as well try. ""We just want to help you, alright? Do you have an address?""

She'd answer him, but Allegra's attention has already been taken up by the Carousel. It's heat and the melting snow on it fascinating her. Climbing up onto it, she holds onto one of the poles, a smile brightening her face as some of the chill in her feet is immediately eased. Nudging a melting pile of slush with her toe, she turns back to the other two, apparently unconcerned with either her state of undress, or the state of the weather. ""Heat makes the snow melt. Makes the cold go.. warm?"" Her words are almost perfectly accentless, but they sound odd nonetheless, each one spoken as though it were the first time she'd ever said them aloud, the same hesitancy and almost questioning tilt to each one.

Steven answers without looking for more than a glance. ""Yeah. Careful. I might get things too hot. You start hurting, tell me, ok?"" And he continues to heat the Carousel, the spot on the pole where he touches is starting to glow faintly, but he doesn't move his hand.

Leif doesn't seem at all disturbed by the rapidly-warming carousel. His fingers twitch as he watches the girl and finally he can't resist. He flips open his messenger bag and pulls out a pencil and a small sketchpad, his fingers flying across the page as he draws. ""You know of anywhere to take her?"" He asks the other man, never taking his eyes from either the girl or his drawing.

""Hurt?"" Allegra asks, and the questioning tone strengthens, her eyes darkening with confusion. The word.. she has explanations in her head for it, but nothing that will put it into proper context for her. ""I will tell you.."" And then she stops, and stares at Leif curiously. ""What are you doing?""

""Yeah I know a pla..."" Steven starts to say before he glances up at the sound of the pencil on paper and the woman's question. ""You better not be showin' that around until you know she don't mind."" he says with narrowed eyes and sudden focus. The problem with this is the distraction serves to take his mind off more important things, like what he's doing to the Carousel. Fortunately, he continues to warm it, but unfortunately, by letting his focus wander, he's suddenly heating it much hotter without realizing.

Leif smiles at Allegra, ""Drawing you-- making a picture."" He'll show it to her when he's done, the quick marks of graphite on paper coming together to form a vibrant picture of the girl, the situation. ""Oh, I draw everything,"" he reassures the other man. ""If I decide to use it in anything, I'll change her face."" After all, it's just a situation study, not a police profile sketch or anything.

And just that easily another concept comes into context for her. It takes a moment for Allegra to understand, as the heat beneath her feet quickly goes from mild and comfortable to very warm, and then hot. ""It is.. very hot.."" she says to Stephen, and then her eyes widen in distress, and she's taking a quick step to the edge of the Carousel. ""Very hot. It my skin, it is too hot. It burns.""

Steven snaps his attention back to the Carousel at her words, muttering obscenities as he does. As he turns, he releases his grip to grab some handfuls of snow from the ground nearby and start tossing them toward the area close to her feet. ""Stay near this. It'll cool it enough to not hurt you."" he directs. Then, he starts using both hands, while muttering 'white. white. white.' under his breath. If either of them are paying attention to the ground, a large three fingered blue glove just appeared on the snow near Steven where he dropped it out of his holo emitters field to make this easier.

Interesting, both of them. Leif feels like the other man has the situation pretty well under control, so he just draws, fleshing in some details as he continues to look up at the girl, studying her, though not at all sexually. He is, right now, merely an artist-- though, his eyes light up as he realizes something, and he turns a page and starts to draw, faster this time, more intensely.

Without any question, Allegra does as she is told, remaining close to the melting snow. Her expression clears a little as the snow cools the metal, tension slowly easing out of her body. Watching Steven closely, she tilts her head, her posture almost submissive as she waits for further directions.

Steven gives up on hiding from the woman. He's given her too good a look now. Of course, as long as he hears that pencil, he's not going to give the artist a chance to draw his face if he can help it. He stops tossing the snow, holding one last handful as he speaks. ""Sorry about that. I don't watch what I'm doin' and I end up doin' weird things."" As he speaks, the snow in his hands starts dribbling out from between his fingers... as sand.

Leif keeps drawing, his eyes almost half lidded as he looks just at the paper. Then, with a soft sigh, he opens his bag again and slips his sketchpad and pencil in. He pulls out a pair of ladies jeans and a little black t-shirt that says 'I <heart> New York' along with appropriate undergarments. Draping them over his arm, he walks closer to the other two and offers them for the girl. Of course they're the exact right size and come complete with designer tags.

Allegra looks up as Leif approaches, holding her hands out for the bundle of clothing as he offers them. Once she has them, though, she appears more puzzled than grateful. Shaking out the shirt, she looks at it for a moment, one fingertip tracing the heart, and then flicks the tag with a fingertip, before turning to look at Leif in confusion.

Steven grins at the outfit. ""Nice."" he says with a wry grin. ""You always carry ladies clothes for emergencies?"" As he talks, he stoops to the snow and starts packing some of it into rough moccasin shapes. He glances at the woman's feel, then carefully packs in some more. ""Tell ya what. You got the outfit. I'll do some fur lined boots to get her somewhere safe.""

Leif grins back at Steven, ""I have many lady friends-- one of them will just have to let me buy her dinner instead of getting her outfit back."" Then he looks up at the girl and her obvious confusion. ""They're clothes, sweetheart. You put them on."" He touches his own shirt as an example. ""To keep you warm and covered.""

Nodding slowly, Allegra turns the shirt until she finds the biggest opening.. hey, she's got a lot to learn, but she's not -dumb-, and puts her head into it. Wriggling her arms around inside until she finds the sleeves, she tugs the shirt on. It's backwards, but at least it's covering her. And it is warmer. Shaking out the jeans, she holds them against her, and then looks at Leif, her gaze going down to his own pants. Nodding to herself, she tries to step into them, but thin as she is, she's not thin enough to get into them that way.. and she hasn't discovered the fastenings yet.

Steven starts running his hand slowly and carefully over the very literal snow shoes he's made. As he does, the color and texture changes. Slowly, they shift from snow to the hard black material average shoe soles are made from. ""I ain't gonna be as fast as he was, but I'll get 'em by the time ya finish dressin', Leggy.""

Leif's lips twitch into a smile as he watches her, but he hops up onto the carousel and approaches slowly. ""Hey, hon, let me show you how, alright?"" He reaches around her and undoes the button and zipper so she can see him do it. Not a damn soul at the bar would believe he could stand behind a half naked woman, put his arms around her, and not take her to bed. ""Then you put them on and close them back up.""

Allegra watches closely as Leif undoes the button and the zipper, and then nods at him. Taking the pants, she holds them down and steps carefully into them. It takes her a moment of fumbling to get the button fastened and the zipper pulled up, but the smile she gives Leif when she finally gets it done is brilliant. Steven gets her attention then, and she shifts that smile on him. ""What are you making?""

Steven picks up his now solid rubber shoes. Then he starts on the tops again, first turning them to an artificial fur that looks like that cheesy fake rabbit that's so common, careful to only get the upper part and not the sole. After that, he starts on the same area again, waterproofing the fur with a top layer of a pliant plastic. ""Shoes. You'll just have to pull 'em over your feet. They ain't gonna be a great fit, but they'll get ya somewhere warm and we can get ya real ones later.""

Leif steps away from her as she does up the pants, then returns her beautiful smile. Oh, hey wow. ""What was I drawing? You. Once we get you somewhere warmer and out of the snow, you can see it, alright?"" He hops off of the carousel and goes to scrounge up his easel again.

Finally dressed, Allegra sits down on the edge of the carousel, watching Steven approach her with no little curiosity. She replies to Leif with more questions, though she doesn't stop watching Steven. She doesn't seem at all put off by his appearance, nor his attempts to keep most of it hidden, she simply watches him curiously. ""Where will we go? Everywhere there is.. snow. And cold. It was not cold before.""

Steven gives the shoes one last pass of his hand, making them toasty warm before passing them over to her. ""I got some friends that take in people that show up like this all the time. I can get ya a warm room there for the night, then we can see what we need to do, if ya like."" As he offers the shoes he smiles at her. ""And I promise there ain't gonna be no one bother ya until ya get some rest and feel up to it.""

Leif reaches to help the girl off the carousel when she's got the shoes on. ""Look, sweetheart, I'm going to give this guy my phone number and you two can give me a call later if you want to see the picture. It looks like he's going to take care of you from here, though."" He looks to the other guy to make sure while he pulls out a card from his bag. 'Leif Erik Scott -- Freelance Artist' it reads with an address and a telephone number.

Allegra accepts Leif's assistance, standing up from the carousel and smiling at him. ""I will go with him, and we will.. call?... you later?"" she asks quietly, and then turns to nod to Steven. Walking over to him, she stands quietly, looking down at the snow, inspecting the shoes she's so recently acquired, before looking up at Steven again. ""I don't understand..""

Steven nods to Leif and smiles. ""We will. Thanks."" He takes the card with a glance at it and a smile. ""Probably be tomorrow, but maybe a while longer. Depends on her."" Then he turns to her. ""I'll explain it all to ya as we go, ok? It's late and he needs some sleep and you need to get in outta this weather."" He glances down, looking for something on the ground. Not that that dark blue glove is hard to find on snow.

Leif nods to Steven and smiles at the girl. ""Well, I will talk to you in the future, then. If you will excuse me."" He hefts the easel and starts off down the path again, towards home. Turns out it was a good thing he didn't take the subway after all. She was kinda cute.

Watching Leif leave, Allegra turns to Steven with a puzzled frown. ""Why is he going away?"" she asks, her voice small and sounding lost. ""Will he disappear too?"" And then she's following the direction of Steven's gaze, her eyes lighting on the glove partially concealed by snow. ""Why are you looking at that?"" she asks him, switching subjects as easily as breathing.

Steven smiles easily at her. ""Well, he won't disappear. He'll go home. And, I'm looking for that to keep from changing more stuff like I did those shoes."" He reaches for the glove and hesitates. ""Don't worry when it disappears. I... I got a gizmo that makes me look different and it'll hide the glove when I pull it on.""

Blinking a bit, Allegra looks up at Steven, and then smiles. ""I won't worry,"" she promises. ""Why does it hide the glove? Why do you change things? Can everyone change things?"" Still smiling, she reaches for his arm. ""Can I do it? Can you show me how?""

Steven laughs with pleasant humor as he tugs the glove on and it vanishes. When she touches his arm,. she should get another surprise. What looks like a bare arm is actually harder than it should be, as well as larger than it looks and covered in cloth. ""It covers everything. Some people are scared of how I look without me hiding under this image. It's because I'm a mutant."" Heck. May as well tell her everything. He gestures toward Avalon to indicate which way to go and takes a slow step to see if she follows while he walks. ""Not everyone is a mutant, and not every mutant is alike, so I'm the only one that can do it that I know. I don't think you'll be able to, but I'd show ya if I could."" There. That's everything, right?

Following meekly beside him, Allegra fingers Steven's arm curiously, questions spilling from her lips with every step. ""What is a mutant? Why are people scared of how you look? Why would they be scared because you're a mutant?"" Apparently, she finally runs out of questions.. or out of breath, one of the two, as she gazes silently up at him, slowing while waiting for his response.

Steven takes a deep breath before grinning at her. ""You got a lot of questions."" he says with a chuckle before getting to the next round of answers. ""Lets see... a mutant. Well, easiest way to put it is a mutant is an ordinary person with something special about 'em. In my case, it's the way I change things when I touch 'em and the way I look."" And a couple of other things that just aren't worth mention right now. ""I look kinda like a cross between a guy and a bug without my gizmo, and people are scared of mutants because they think we're gonna hurt 'em 'cause we're different.""

""Why would they do that?"" Allegra asks, her voice quieter as she tries to process all of this information. ""Isn't everyone different? Individual?"" She shakes her head. ""I don't think you'll look scary,"" she finally pronounces. ""Just different. Individual. Like me. Like.. "" and she points behind her, back towards where Leif went walking off. ""All different.""

Steven laughs at that, full and boisterous. ""Leggy, if I wasn't taken I think I'd propose."" he says happily. ""Ya see, when ya start labelin' people, ya cause some of 'em to think they gotta take sides. Us against them. And when the people started getting special powers and got labeled mutants, we got lumped together with the few that used their powers to just take stuff.""

Allegra nods slowly, though her expression remains confused. ""Why do you call me that?"" she asks, though she doesn't sound upset. ""And.. I do not understand. Why would people use their.. their powers to take stuff? Why do they need to take things? Is taking things wrong?""

Steven cocks his head slightly. ""How old are ya anyway?"" he asks, then shakes his head. ""Nevermind. Don't matter."" He takes a breath and leads on toward the school. ""Gimmie a sec on this one. Let's see... why do I call ya that. Well, your names Allegra, right? Ah-leg-gra."" He sounds it out, stressing the 'leg' part. ""That's part of it."" With a slight gesture at her legs and a grin he ads ""And the rest is ya got really nice legs."" He pauses to rub his chin. ""Takin' stuff is wrong if it wasn't offered. I gave ya those shoes, so takin' them was fine. But say I wanted that coat you're wearin'. Me just takin' it wouldn't be right. Ya understand?""

For answer, Allegra peels off the coat that she's wearing, looking quite pleased that she manages to unzip the zipper without needing another demonstration. Without a word, she hands it out to him. ""No."" She is her only response at first, and then she smiles quickly. ""Yes. Property. The shoes were yours. Then you gave them to me, and they are mine. I own them. Taking property is wrong. Unless you ask first.""

Steven shakes his head and waves for her to put the coat back on. ""I don't need the coat, but thank you for offing it. But yeah. That's exactly what I mean."" He smiles wider and then the smile falls. ""I forgot to tell ya. When I make stuff like that, it don't stay long. Those shoes'll turn back to snow in a couple hours. Maybe less. I'll get ya some real ones tomorrow, ok?""

Allegra trots along beside him, not looking in the least bit dismayed at the notion of losing her shoes. ""Real shoes? Where will we get them? Is it always and forever snow and cold?"" Looking around the chilly sidewalks, she grasps his arm to point at the lights of a nearby billboard, her eyes wide with amazement. ""Look.. that! Why is it sparkling colors like that? What is it?""

Steven chuckles again, turning and looking at her once more with that wide smile. ""We'll find a place."" he says, smothering the smartass answer that first came to mind. ""it'll warm up come summertime. Or, if ya go down where I'm from, it's a lot warmer."" When the lights catch her eye, he can't stop himself from muttering. ""Toto. We're not in Kansas anymore."" Then he settles down to be serious again. ""It's an ad. They made it bright and sparkly to make people look at it to try and convince them to buy whatever the ads for. That one's..."" he hesitates and looks at the sign again ""Some crappy cola ripoff.""

""Where are you from? There's no snow there? Ever?"" And then she stops, and it's almost possible to see things falling into place for her. ""Summertime. No snow. Warm. Winter is snow. And cold. Spring? Fall?"" She shakes her head. ""Why do all the words.."" There's no way to explain it. The queer feeling of knowing a word. Having the definition there for you, and yet.. having no way to understand it. ""Will summertime burn? Like the.. the.. thing I was standing on? Will it hurt?""

Steven nods in encouragement as she starts putting together a few things. ""It's almost always warm and we don't see much snow 'cept on top of the mountain."" He explains when she starts on the questions again. ""Summertime up here ain't so bad. Back home ya can get a real nasty sunburn if ya ain't careful. If ya are, it ain't bad at all.""

""The sun.. it can burn you?"" Allegra asks uncertainly. ""How are you careful? Will you show me? There is so much.. so much that doesn't.. that I do not quite understand. The words.."" She taps her head, watching Steven to see if he understands. ""They are all there.. but.. they do not all make sense.""

Steven nods. ""I'll show ya, or I'll see to it that you meet someone else that will. I'll make sure that ain't nobody gonna hurt ya."" Or take advantage of her either. She's too much like a child not to get some protectiveness going. ""As for bein' careful. There's lotions and clothes and shade and just plain stayin' inside. Lots of things ya can do.""

The smile that Allegra gives Steven is so open, so bright, that it lights her entire face. She holds nothing back, builds no walls to hide behind. Everything that she thinks and feels is there, clearly written on her face for those with the skill to see such things. Reaching out, she touches his arm once more, her hand squeezing it softly for a moment. ""Thank you. You are kind.'

Steven grins easily, returning that open expression as much as he can. ""Glad to. You're a nice girl, Leggy. I don't want nothin' bad happenin' to ya."" And he doesn't plan to let it either.

""Nothing bad will happen to me,"" Allegra responds confidently. ""I will not take things. I will not do bad. Why should anything bad happen?"" At least, she'll try not to do bad. She wants to please people. She wants them to be happy with her. ""I will do whatever you say, Steven. I promise. I will be good.""</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Promises, promises."">Steven shakes his head again, but continues to hold that smile. ""I don't think you'll do bad, but that won't protect you. You're sweet and innocent and that's what will hurt you. Someone will take advantage of you."" He turns to rest a hand on her shoulder, and she can feel the odd three fingered grip when he does. ""I'm glad you'll listen to me, but don't just do what I tell ya. If ya ain't sure, ask why. Think about it. Ya won't upset me if ya tell me 'no.""

This more than startles her. Looking almost disturbed, Allegra stops for a moment, staring at Steven in confusion. ""But"" she begins to protest, and then stops. How can she obey an order that tells her not to obey? ""I do not understand,"" she murmurs plaintively. ""Why should I not do as you say? I.. that is what I am supposed to do!""

Steven stops himself, licking his lips and thinking for a bit. ""Tell you what. We'll do it your way right now. I'll tell you what to do, and you tell me if you don't get it, ok? Maybe after I know where you're from, I'll be able to explain what I mean better.""

And that easily, Allegra relaxes, her shoulders slumping as she moves back to his side once more. ""I wilL tell you if I don't understand,"" she agrees readily. ""And I will try to tell you where I am from, Steven, but.. I do not.. it was different from here, and I did not get to see it for very long before I was here.""

Steven nods again, escorting her from the park and to the city streets. 'This should be interesting' he thinks as he does. And he starts plotting new answers as he tells her, ""I don't figure you telling me the name of the place would do much, but I bet when we settle down and talk about things, you'll be able to explain a lot more then you think.""

Allegra frowns suddenly, though for once she remains silent as they walk through the city streets. It bothers her, more than she can express, that she can't give him the name of the place. Anymore than she knew the name of this place, before Leif gave it to her. Licking her lips, she glances now and again at Steven, remaining close to him as they make their way through the unfamiliar streets. Not that any street would be familiar.

Steven points out a few things as they walk. Good landmarks to find her way by if she's alone. Odd things that need explanation. Places to avoid. Ways to recognize people that would abuse her in various ways. Then, he leads her to the Avalon building. ""This is where I'm living now. They took me in when I got here, and they'll help you too."" Or he'll make them help.

Allegra listens quietly, nodding at each additional piece of information, and storing it away until she can take it out and examine it later. She asks her own share of questions, pointing out interesting things as they pass them. And they pass several. Cars, birds, a jogger out running despite the snow. ""But it's /cold/. Why would he want to run in the cold? Won't he get sick?"" Stopping to sniff at coffee outside a diner, or to poke at the snowman someone has built, just outside an apartment building. When they stop in front of Avalon, she stares up at the building, her eyes wide. ""It is very very big,"" she whispers. ""Are you sure they will not mind that you bring me here?""

Steven laughs. ""Like you said. It's very, very big."" In other words, they'll probably bitch him out for not telling them, but he doesn't care. She needs the attention more than they need the warning. As he enters, he raises a hand to the night watchman. ""Not one word."" he says with a smirk to the fellow as he heads to the elevator, with her in tow.""

Walking backwards, Allegra smiles at the watchman, one hand lifting to wave at him, before she spins back around, slipping her hand just beneath Steven's arm with a quiet laugh. ""Why did you tell him that?"" she asks, walking close beside him. ""And why is he standing there? Isn't he tired? It is night time. Shouldn't he be asleep?""

Steven grins as the elevator doors close them in and he explains. ""He likes to tease me about my late nights. It's a playful thing. As for why he's there. We've got lots of kids here. Young mutants that could get hurt easy of someone wanted to. He sleeps during the day so he can watch and make sure on one hurts us at night.""

""Are there many kids here?"" She says the word kids as if not quite certain of it's meaning, before nodding to herself. ""It is good that he does that. He is a nice man too? To be willing to watch to keep the young children safe?""

Steven nods quickly at that. ""Yeah. It's a school so there's plenty of 'em here. They ain't all mutants, but enough are. And he's a real nice fellow. Like I said, we tease a lot, but it's all in fun.""

Allegra nods, trying to absorb it all. ""Why weren't you sleeping, Steven? Why were you out so late at night? You should have been sleeping, not out in the park when it is cold."" She grins suddenly, leaning against him. ""Though I am very glad you were out in the park. It would have been much colder if you were not there.""

Steven shrugs slightly. ""I'm trying to learn how not to forget myself and hurt someone with my powers. I had some training to do this afternoon and I went out to relax for a while after. I had a few drinks and was on my way back when I saw that flash."" He pauses and glances at her. ""Did you happen to see a red crystal before you showed up in the park?""

Thinking carefully, Allegra shakes her head. ""No. There were many stones in my father's room, but none like that, I don't think. Not that I saw while I was there, anyway."" Jumping slightly as the elevator moves, she reaches for Steven's arm. ""Is the room going to fall?""

Steven shakes his head. ""Not fall. This is an elevator. It's for going up and down in these tall buildings without having to climb lots of steps. I know you could walk up Leggy, but my knees can't take it.""

Allegra blinks a bit, glancing down at his knees. ""Why?"" she asks softly, and then squats down to peer at his legs, poking at his knees with her fingertip. ""They do not look broken. Why wouldn't they be able to go up steps?""

Steven sighs. ""I was in the military a long time ago. A soldier. I hurt my knees back then and they aren't really right anymore. They still work, but they hurt and a lot of stairs is too painful.""

Allegra frowns, her lips trembling as she looks up at him. ""I do not want you to hurt,"" she says quietly. ""How can I help you to not hurt?"" Reaching out, she touches one knee softly, without shifting her gaze from his face. ""We will not go up any stairs, I promise.""

Steven grins. ""I can do a few, but this is a lot. Too many."" He doesn't bother to tell her he _always_ hurts some. It's just something he's learned to live with. ""I figure the best thing to do tonight is to just let you have my bed for the night and we'll see about a room or something tomorrow.""

Allegra stands up, and nods. ""Alright."" She says quietly, still glancing down at his knee. ""I will try to learn how to make it stop hurting,"" she says quietly. ""There must be something. If they can make rooms that go up and down, then they should be able to fix your knees.""

Steven smiles wider at that. ""You keep that up, I might propose anyway, Leggy."" he says as the elevator reaches the floor for the private rooms. ""Let me check the hall, and then I'll take ya to my room."" He grins at her before moving to the door to the Mars hall. ""Don't wanna catch someone in their skivvies.""

Allegra waits quietly beside the elevator until Steven lets her know that it is safe to join him. She can't help looking curiously at the little bit of the room that she can see from the elevator. By the time he returns to her, she's dancing with impatience, shifting from foot to foot, her lips curling into a smile at the sight of him. ""There is so much here!"" She exclaims. ""Will you show me? All of it? As soon as we wake up?""

Steven laughs softly as he leads her to the hall. ""I'll show you all I can. There's a lot to see."" Before opening the door he makes a slight shushing motion. ""We'll need to be quiet. People are sleeping here.""

Allegra opens her mouth to speak, and then nods her head quickly, touching her lips. It isn't easy to be quiet. She wants to ask so many questions as they make their way to his room, but she manages it. Barely. Once inside, she's looking as though she'll burst. ""How many people?"" She asks. ""Will they.. are they all nice too? When will I meet them?""

Steven laughs again, her eagerness contagious. ""Soon. There are lots of them, and I usually cook for a bunch of 'em every day. They're all nice, but there ain't many like me. I'm a southerner. We know how to raise gentlemen."" Even if he's a redneck and not a gentleman.

Allegra's smile widens. ""I am certain there is no-one like you,"" she says with easy confidence. ""Though I do not understand what southerner..you are from the south?"" And then she nods, remembering. ""Yes. The south."" Still holding onto his arm, she begins to look around curiously, poking at things. ""This is your room? Where you sleep?""

Steven nods and indicates the bed. ""Right there."" he says as he opens a drawer and pulls out a spare blanket. ""You can stretch out on it."" he tells her as he moves to the more comfortable looking chair and settles onto it. Once settled, he flips the blanket out, spreading it to cover himself.

Allegra frowns a bit as she watches him, glancing between the chair and the bed. ""Why are you sleeping in the chair?"" she asks quietly, sitting down on the edge of the bed. ""The bed, that is for sleeping, and the chair for sitting, yes? You will be stiff if you stay there all night.""

Steven smiles as he tugs the blanket around him. ""Because if I sleep on the floor, I'll not only be stiff, I'll be stuck."" He gestures fro her to take the bed. ""And it wouldn't be right for me to sleep with you. We just met Leggy.""

Allegra snorts, shaking her head. ""That's silly,"" she says, as she turns and climbs up into the bed, curling beneath the covers. ""It is big enough to share, and beds are for sleeping. Not floors or chairs. I think you are being.. "" she searches for the word, her brow wrinkling. ""What could be not right about sleeping?""

Steven squirms to try and find a comfortable position to sleep in the chair. ""Some people might not think we were just sleeping. They might tell what they think and get all kinds of rumors started."" Of course, that'll happen anyway with him having her in the room. ""Plus, a guy and a girl that aren't... intimate don't need to be sleepin' in the same bed.

Allegra sits up, watching him squirm from across the room. ""Like regular people think about mutants?"" she asks, and then frowns. ""Those people are wrong. And anybody else would be wrong too. I"" And she struggles for the words, unable to understand everything that he'd said. ""I said I would help you to not hurt. You are hurting. You will sleep in the bed. I can sleep on the floor.""

Steven shakes his head again. ""That wouldn't be good manners. You should have the bed. A man's supposed to let the lady have the bed.""

Her lips pinching together, Allegra's frustration is easily read. ""I am.. I do not understand,"" she says miserably. ""I am not supposed to.. I will do as you say,"" she finally says, though she doesn't sound at all happy about it. ""But you make me break my promise. I.. I do not like that..'

Steven sighs at that. He can never stand to see a woman pout like that. ""All right. You win, Leggy. Just gimme a minute."" He stands and heads into his bathroom, coming back out after a little with the rod for the shower curtain. He lays it down the bed, slightly of center and he indicates the smaller side. ""I hate to crowd your side, but I take up a lot of room."" It ain't a sword, but it's the best he can do on short notice.

Looking down at the curtain rod, Allegra seems confused, but then she simply shrugs. ""I don't need very much room,"" she says quietly, rolling onto her side with a pleased smile. Tugging the blanket over her shoulders, she nestles her head into the pillow, closing her eyes. ""I"" and then she stops, and rolls back over, looking at Steven. ""I don't know your name.""

Steven crawls into his side, settling and relaxing with a sigh. So much better than a chair. ""I'm Steven."" he answers before rolling away from her to settle in. ""And we'll work out better arrangements for tomorrow.""

""Yes, Steven,"" Allegra replies compliantly, rolling back over. It doesn't take her long to fall asleep. Even for one newly awakened, the young simulacrum has been through a great deal in a short period of time, and both mind and body need time to adjust. She'll sleep, and sleep deeply, until both have had the time they need."

It all started Friday night when my son suddenly got this bumps on his skin. Then those bumps went bigger until they met each other to form a swelling on areas around his eyes. Then I also notice how he is itchy all over his body and when I checked its all read and there ar erashes on parts of him.

I actually panicked. I am use to fever and I know what to do when he has got one. I am so thankful for ibuprofen as it works better on him than paracetamol. But this is something new and I dont know how to react.

Luckily I remember that he has got those anti itch meds from his chicken pox and when I check its antihistamine. I googled the generic name first and gave him a small dose. After a few minutes he started going back to sleep and few hours more the swelling went away and I can already breath normally.

I was just looking at my son&#39;s face. New things scares me like this swelling.

We both woke up late the next day and its like nothing had happened to him! I am so thanful for that stash of meds as they are lifesaver. I know that when you have allergic reaction its the thing that you cant see that you should be scared of. You can see the swelling outside but there can be some activity inside one&#39;s body too. And your air passage could swell and the victim cant breath. I saw this from my boss before and she want sent to the ER. Just in time as well as if they sent her later she could have died. We dont have ambulances like you have here so its my officemate who brought her to the hospital.

Same reason why I am scared of allergic reaction. I was actually ready to call 999 if the swelling did not stop.

I cleaned the whole room the day after and vacuumed hard. I also washed all the bed sheets and linens on high temp. I dont want to take chances and yet the night after he got the same swelling around his eyes. I immediately gave my son another 2.5ml of antihistamine and he slept again and the rashes went away.

I feel so helpless and I really wish that my mother is here because I feel so alone. Obviously its just me who is facing this. I have so many questions in my head. Why only at night? It is the room? I have cleaned already what else should I need to clean?

I am hugging my son touching the itchy bits of him till he fall asleep. Every so often I would check him. Look at him closely to see if he is moving because I am so scared of losing him.

We went to our normal routine after that. But I have scheduled a trip to the doctor.

HE said its okay to give him antihistamine as long as he needs it. He said to go back if its lasted till this week so that we can check whats the cause of my son&#39;s allergic reaction.

He also gave him something for the rashes.

<lj-embed id=""182""/>

Everytime my son would be in school I would air out the room and spray Dettol.
I would vacuum again and again. Every corner I try to such the dust out.

Good news is that last night the rashes didnt went back and I dont need to dose him with antihistamine anymore.

This is like just when I am so awesome at tackling fever comes allergic rhinitis.
Motherhood is so weird. A learning process.
And I am so exhausted in my education this week haha!

Allergy is definitely my word of the week

He was a bit sluggish and the weather is not that bright so its home for us last weekend.
Lego is out and he played with his toy and also promising to make the living room a Lego City Room.

Ummm I think he is working on achieving his promise!

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0121_rev_2.jpg"" width=""600"" />

After few minutes of creating a Lego City its time for me to vacuum specially since he has been getting rashes.
I am so keen on vacuuming all the mites and sand that is hiding in our house.

<lj-embed id=""181""/>

My son is not keen on the sound of the vacuum. For so long he is scared of it. Now we find a nice solution, him wearing his headphone to lessen the sound. And while he is doing that he is reading his book. One of his fave that he has been reading since he is 3 or 4! We have lost it but found it again in the library and he just have to borrow it (using my card of course =P).

And while I am vacuuming I remember him being small and liking that book way before.
When he cant still read and can only understand the book because of its photos.

This is him with that same book 2 years ago and see the whole post <a href=""http://pixiedusk.livejournal.com/219193.html"" target=""_blank"">here</a>!
<img alt=""Traffic3"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/pixiedusk/1203704/165450/165450_600.jpg"" title=""Traffic3"" />

2 years on with less hair he is still in love with that book! (And can we talk about the quality of the photos too haha!)
He probably love that book better now now that he can really read and understand the words.

It so amazing how much he had grown in 2 years and he will be 6 soon! So I got so emotional while vacuuming.

So many changes had happened and is happening but I still adore my baby. Forever my baby no matter what age he will be.

And dont you just love blogging and how you can always go back to a specific memory!

Since I started being active to instagram I became exposed to people who actively create. People showing their finished works and sometimes even how to do it.

Its an inspiring platform for me but I havent really started painting since last week. I would at first copy their design. The first 2 instagram post are not my original design. Just something I saw in some of the accounts. The 2 photos are my own which I both did yesterday! First is dandelion as I am so obsessed with them and the second design is a shirt design that I saw on one kid!

I have been doing this and I have so many more designs in my head. I would start with them, I just need time!
My watercolor is almost gone. I am worried that I cant continue actually as I dont have any budget to buy news colors but I have some tubes of acrylic so I might need to overcome my fear of using it and be brave enough to try.

Acrylic is something stronger than watercolor. It dries fast and when it does you can never re-use it. Thats why i fear it because the drawings above is done in parts. I would do small bits, do chores, and then go back. With acrylic I really need to sit down and concentrate otherwise I would waste the paint.

Sorry for blabbing about paints haha. Creative is my word of the week!

In my terrace, the strawberry is back with a vengeance even if somewhere in it&#39;s soil are slugs. Yes you heard that right. I have got slugs and killed my lavender and all of the other plants but 2 have survived! Strawberry and Bleeding Hearts won the battle (knock on wood).

Even if I dont like the rain I am so happy that they got lush since it started raining. I wished I have taken photos of them because just last week they are not this healthy!

And in addittion here are the photos of the plants in my adopted garden! Grove Park was empty when I arrived so I have the freedom to linger!

It was gloomy and raining the whole day and when the night comes BOOM! sun went out and look at how clear the photos are at 7pm!

I would have stayed longer but I have Mommy duties.
Its so nice to see the plants basking in the sun after the rain.
I am sure they are doing the happy dance to get both sun and rain the same day!

Though school started Tuesday last week, it was a busy one for my son.
It is eventful indeed as he levelled up in his reading and he got a cetificate. Yay on all those.

Then add violin lessons, reading every night and his taekwondo lessons too.
Then they will have those phonics exams next month and they are preparing for it in school.

He is just 5 and yet his life is so hectic already!

Sometimes I think that its too much.
So when we have time I just let him play. Just play.
I wont get mad at the sand in him, I wont get mad at the mud or when his clothes get wet!
I will just let him be, a child that needs to relax.

So one day after school with his school pants/trousers still on we went to the beach.
It was a wee bit late than our usual visit but with the weather being nice its okay. People are still there enjoying the water.
And there is water as its high tide!

He was so happy to just go and chase the waves and let the wave chase him.
At one point the tide is rising so fast it caught him in his bike haha!

A wash for his Fred (bike)! That bike has been through a lot!

After more playing in the sand, its time to go. But not until we washed all those sand from his crocs.
Luckily the fountain is empty. He actually wanted to rinse his bike too =P

Enticing actually. Now I just realized I might need to rinse Fred as he might get rust form the salty sea water.

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0125_rev_1.jpg"" width=""600"" />

Seeing him enjoy the night and the water is something. I saw him light up differently.
Today he is back in school and will probably be as busy again. I hope to always squeeze moments like this.
And again I am so thankful and I appreciate that we live near the beach as relaxing is always just steps away from home.

Its part of my routine to walk in the seafront every morning after my school run. It give me steps for my 10k daily goal and well it just really nice to have some fresh salty air before I start my day of blogging, chores and daydreaming.

Once in a while I would use another path. The Beach Lawns.
This pavement of the lawn is parallel to the seafront promenade but less people walk on it and theres less wind when the sea is stormy as you are protected with lush green on it the side exposed to the sea. A barrier if you want to call it.

Today I found this stone in this path.

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0099_revblog.jpg"" width=""600"" />

And then it brought me to that day when I am lost. All I do is sleep and daydream of home and cry in between.
I would like to call it depression but who I am to say? Since this path had less users I would use this always then to
not be seen and not see people. I dont want interaction then. I am living a quiet life then that when I speak it surprises me to hear
the sound of my own voice.

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0087_revblog_1.jpg"" width=""400"" />

Then I saw them. The actual first sign of spring for me. Crocuses.


<lj-embed id=""173"" />

It was so gloomy that day and I remember seeing it from my peripheral vision. I just cant help but look at the only color you can see on the bare wet ground. Basking in the soft raindrops are small flowers. I only have my cellphone and I took photos.
I remember not being happy so I promised that I would go back in the afternoon with a proper camera.

I did and I remember being happy with what I saw.
My son is the only source of sanity then.
Happy is not a feeling that I feel when I am alone wihtout my son.
Seeing that flower is the first time that I smiled by myself.

The days after that I started using my camera again and feeling a wee bit better. I feel more alive.
I cant say that I am healed. The reason for my sadness lives with me in the house so I am still full of rage and sadness. Especially when he would arrive home (?) from work. But I can say that I am SURVIVING.

Surviving is good enough for me now. Surviving is something that I did not see myself doing since September last year.
And surviving is better than being alive but dead inside.

And I am celebrating that survival.

I would want to share with you some photos of blooms that I found in the Beach Lawns.
These blooms are hopefully helping someone out there walking,
looking for something that would be a catalyst to healing or at least survival.

In the morning school run for us now consist of biking at the promenade every morning
thanks to the sunnier and less windy weather we are having.

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0094_rev_2.jpg"" width=""600"" />

This week after school run got a lot longer for us.
We would stay for an hour or so at the beach and act like we are tourist haha.
Sometimes we would find fellow mothers and classmates staying on the beach as well after school.
So school run would turn into a big playgroup full of sand and sand angels.

And when its just us we mostly stay beside the donkeys. My son is so in love with them and would caress them non stop.
It can be a bit embarassing as we are there and are not riding them haha.
But the people behind the donkeys are really nice enough for us to just mingle with them.

I also wrote about how wether there are still costumers or not, when its time for them to rest its rest time!
And I am so greatful for that.

I hope this nice weather would stick. I am liking my son&#39;s color.
When its sunnier too my son&#39;s skin is showing how much he is a bit Filipino. His skin get brown!
We are using spf of course but you cant really help but get some tan when its this sunny.

Welcome back spring!

My word of the week is schoolrun! Umm thats one word right?

I think I might have mentioned a gazillion times how I dont have a garden and would want one. I have this park few meters away from our house that I always visit and in my head it is my garden. Because who can stop me from claiming it! Grove Park is mine *insert evil laugh here*

And when I went this morning after a school run I was lucky enough to see the blooms covered in tiny drops of water. I am early enough to see them covered in dew and they are a sight to behold! Warm bright sun and dewy blooms, it finally feels like its really spring here after days of cold and gloom and rain.

Here I am wishing that I better at taking photos because I didnt do these plants any justice.

And I probably need to start a group called dandelion clocks anonymous as this is the nth time that i posted photos of them.
I so love taking pictures of those ball of fluff and I might have too much in my laptop now and I dont think I am going to stop anytime soon!

He has been asking me if we can go in the Grand Pier.
Its so weird that before when my son is a baby, we are there everyday as I love walking.
If i have fitbit then a walk from the entrance to the building entrance would be half of my daily requirement!
But they started having an entrance fee and we never set foot inside it ever.

I am not feeling well since I got hailed at and I have so many excuses when he would ask me if we can go in.
But he said he will pay for my fee using his allowance money (sweet of him!).
So we said we are going (yesterday) then it started to rain non stop and hard.
His spirit was never broken haha. He showed me the BBCWeather app telling me its going to be sunny eventually.

So no more excuses for me! After the rain stopped we headed there. Its windy and gloomy!


<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0014_rev.jpg"" width=""400"" />

But if I can only tell you how happy he is to be inside! His expression is so priceless. I didnt took a photo.
That one, that memory and reaction will be all mine.
But there&#39;s this one. The awe on his face. Can you see it?
Or maybe thats being overwhelmed by so many games!

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0021rev.jpg"" width=""600"" />

We dont have a lot of budget but for him playing those 2p machine is enough and those cheap &pound;1 ride.
All of the rides that we cant go too we took a mental note of saving for those.
We need to save a lot Im telling you. Its so nice that he is not throwing fit when he cant ride something.
So mature of him! But this is his reaction when I told him that we need to go home.

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0033_rev.jpg"" width=""600"" />

When we got out there&#39;s still something to tickle a kid&#39;s fancy!
Its hard when you are a small kid but I was wondering how he manage to get his face in there!
And when I looked at the back!

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0040_rev.jpg"" width=""300"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0042_rev.jpg"" width=""300"" />

And he is asking about this sausage that it putting ketchup on himself??? Umm.. is he going to eat himself?
How do you answer that? I think I need to ask the people behind the Pier =P

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0045_rev.jpg"" width=""300"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0050_rev.jpg"" width=""300"" />

And we suddenly notice the SUN! Its bright! So yey!
It turned out to be nice day! And as a bonus we were able to see the donkey after a day&#39;s work.
Its so nice to see that they are well taken care of.
There are still some customers who wants to have a go
but the owners said that its way past the time and its time for them to rest.
When the saddles are out the donkey begins to play!

And they can be very very cute too!

My son is going to be 6 years old soon (too soon if you ask me) and his birthday gift wish is a Blue Peter Badge.

It all started when he is a bit bored with Cbeebies and opted to watch Danger Mouse in the mornings.
Then his creative mind was captured by Art Ninja and that &#39;Ninja Skillz&#39; expression became a norm in the house.
He also love Project Ouch. The more grosse the better haha!

Then he saw one oif the host of a show called Blue Peter inside a balloon trying to cycle in the ocean!
He started watching this show and then he found out about the badge.
He was heartbroken when he found out that its only for 6 years old.
Just like how he is heartbroken when his classmates are (almost) all 6 and he is still 5.
He cant wait to get to that age before and he is more eager to be 6 now.

Few months on and he is really near that age. He drew a whale and we sent it to the show.
We then printed a review form a week after and we answered it early Saturday and
sent it by afternoon just in time for postman to get the mails.
I have to admit that my son&#39;s handwriting needs a lot of patience to read
but I can tell you that he worked hard to answer the questions in there.
I am going ahead with this because he wants that badge so bad and he is working hard to get one.

And few hours ago we watched the website of the show and looked at videos of how kids got their badge and his mind is now
flooded with ideas on how to get another one! Recruiting me to learn how to scooter for a sport badge! Goodluck with that =P

And how I wish I can get him one of those badge. For some reason other than all the effort that he is giving to get it.

I would give him the gold badge. Its not just because I am bias cuz he is my son but also because
our family is in the middle of a big change and the only person who is handling it very well is him.

In the breakdown of my marriage there is a kid in the middle.

And that kid in the middle is still happy and smiling and going ahead with his life even if his parents are always on each other&#39;s heels.
Even if sometimes he is a referee to warring parents.

That kid in the middle is always the sunshine to both the parents who are always in the dark
because the love that has bonded them is no longer anough for them to be still together.

That kid in the middle is always ready to give his mother a hug when she is on the brink of giving up on everything.

My son is the only reason why I am still sane even on the darkest days. My partner in crime!

It might take a lot to have that elusive gold badge but to me you are the gold badge.
Someone I am most proud of to wear (to be with).

You did not win a nobel peace prize or an oscar but you saved me and still is saving me.

You are my Superhero, SuperSeb!

And because I am cheesy as ... I drew him a badge! I tweaked the original blue peter badge and other sunshine!
He likes the drawing but he said he cant wear it and he cant use it to enter attractions hehe so there goes my effort =P

I am always in love with flowers! And I am so happy that spring is slowly making it presence felt over here.
So when I got a free time to take photos outside I grabbed the opportunity.
And if you follow me on instagram you might notice how I am so in love with dandelion clocks!

<lj-embed id=""168""/>

<lj-embed id=""169""/>

And well I cant stop taking more photos of them haha!

I was suppose to solely dedicate this post to dandelion clocks but I cant help but share to you this photo of a bracelet hanging on a tree.
I might have seen so many of them in this park before but this is the only time I paid attention as this bracelet is new.
I was thinking is this a sign of love? Instead of hurting the tree by engraving your name you decorate it with bracelets?
Like those lovelocks? I love the idea or I just love how I interpret this.

It started to get dark and I worry about my laundry hanging outside my terrace so I went home
but I promise to go back to take more photos of the bracelets on the trees next time I come back.

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0074_rev_2.jpg"" width=""400"" />

And I promise to share it here with you!

Its already the end of the week and my head still thinks its a Monday or Tuesday (mostly Monday).
Time is flying fast and I am having a hard time keeping up hehe.

And when I say I am having a hard time keeping up its usually on the blogging bits and oh okay everything!
Blogging and chores.

I was planning on commenting on all the linky and yet I only manage to finish last Sunday&#39;s today.
So here I am apologizing. I will make it up to you next week when I am better.

So what&#39;s wrong with me? Is there something wrong with me?
I was just having a half term separation anxiety. I have a hangover of the holiday.
Part of me still wants it to be holiday and in reality the hollidays ended days ago.

Its so nice that the week is ending so that I can have a time to adjust my head. I hope I can.
Its not so nice to be delayed. Its not so nice that every one is moving so fast and I am like moving in slow motion.

As to why I added this selfie of me in this post. I dont know either. Haha.
Its probably because a camera is something constant about me always lately.
A security blanket that tells me that though time is flying fast I have my camera to capture fleeting moments
to look at when my brain is ready to face realities that I dont want to face.

My word of the week is fleeting.

Armed with our M&amp;Ms peanuts (not sponsored) we went to the park!
We also brought some drawing stuff with us like pens and papers and his create comic book book.
While he is busy munching on the chocies and drawing and being ever so serious with his book
(or maybe its just the sun thats why he is squinting hence giving him the serious look) I am walking around taking photos.

Photos mostly of him being creative at the park and the flowers and blooms around us.

After he created a seperhero named after him he jumped around throwing sticks,
chasing an imaginary villain which gave me some time to have a fast pencil sketch of
this cafe.

Its not tidy and its just pencil but I think its nice enough.
I am planning on doing some more but I think I am creeping out the waiter so I stopped and just watched my son play.

This is what spring is for me and I cant wait for more sessions like this! I am planning on doing the bandstand next time we visit and I hope no one is there to get creeped out by a lady with her sketchpad and pencil =P

I think that my blog is saturated with Beach post (sorry).
We basically live there and my son is so at home at the beach that everytime we visit (everyday really)
he would just slump down on the sand.

He doesnt care of the saltiness or the sand getting on his shirt or *gasp* his hair and eyes he just have this urge to be one with the sand.
He needs to touch it. Embrace it and hug it . Maybe even at the degree of homesickness that I have
theres still this one thing that I would miss here in the UK if ever (read: never) I will go home. Its the beach as I live in the city there.

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0076_rev_2.jpg"" width=""600"" />

I will miss the beach and how accessible it is for us.

<lj-embed id=""161""/>



<lj-embed id=""162""/>

<lj-embed id=""163""/>

And how comfortable my son is with it. And I am happy with that. I am happy to raise a child that
feels one with nature. How he is not scared of the water, the waves, the mud and the sand.
A kid that is not scared to be dirty and wet. A boy who chases seagulls and pigeons and crows.
 

I might have complained a lot thru comments in the other blog how I dont have a garden for my son to play in, how I dont have a space but
come to think of it, I really do have the biggest playground for my son: the beach.

We are going to go again this afternoon because the beach is calling our name and we can never say no to its invitation!

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/Lego%20Easterwotw.jpg"" width=""600"" />


My son made this lego set all by himself (no help from me and while I am bugging him to pose with every chance I get!)
and he said that the characters looks like us!
And they do as I love to paint and he loves to do funny expressions!
Easter break ends today for us and on Monday its back to school grind.

Right about now I am already missing our walks on the beach, bike and scooter rides. Sand digging and creating sand angels.
I know that we can still do this on our school run but there would be less energy and freedom.
I am also going to miss his presence. His willingness to pose for me while I am taking photos in the park and the beach or while he is making Lego!
I&#39;ll miss ideas on how to pose and how to make my photos even better.
He is always willing to give a smile and a hug and a kiss when needed too! Such generosity and creativity.

2 weeks ago I have a weak child due to the illnesses that we got before school break. Now he is back to his normal self
and is so eager to go back to learning! Truly this break is needed.
And the things that we did no matter how simple (and free) did wonders to both our tired souls!

So much more had happened that I cant talk about in the blog.
And yes they stressed him out. I think they can be too much for a 5 year old boy.
I wish I can protect him from those events but I cant. Its beyond my control.
But if theres something that he learned (and I have proven hopefully) from those
is that no matter what happens I am there for him as much as he is there for me.
Those events made our bond stronger.
Those events made me realized how at the end of the day its only really him
and me against everything and everyone.

Easter break is over and spring is finally here.
I think its safe to say that we are both born again.
Or at least better persons than we are 2 weeks ago.


Reborn is my word of the week.

Before, our eating routine doesnt even exist and I am happy that now we do have one,
and my son and I eat together on a table!
To some people eating on a table is normal but to us its been a struggle.
Its a bit of a drag dishes wise but the conversation that we have
while we&#39;re eating our food makes everything so worth it.

I am trying the BOB (Best of Both) Challenge by Arla
(A milk that is as healthy as Skimmed Milk but tastes as good as semi-skimmed milk).
Skimmed milk tastes bland but this one is creamier than l skimmed milk.
A real best of both! And my son is joining me! Always reminding me of the challenge and
he would drink it too! He said it tastes the same as his Big Kid Milk. The challenge is better with him as he is just
enthusiastic. Kids energy is just infectious!

After breakfast I leave my son be to play.
As he is growing older he is now watching few programs from CBBC.
His new fave is Danger Mouse, Project Ouch and Art Ninja (Ninja Skillz!!!).

When I blog he wants to blog and he has got its own blog now. I cant still present it as its new and we
are still sorting it. But if you want to have a look its <a href=""https://kidsbecreative.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. I sometimes forget how much influence I have with him.

He surprised me earlier when he was able to play a tune by ear using his toy piano!
You can see him play <a href=""http://pixiedusk.livejournal.com/418596.html"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.

Late afternoon is when we go out.
It can be him using his bike or scooter. On a blustery day we go to <a href=""http://pixiedusk.livejournal.com/416900.html"" target=""_blank"">parks</a>
but when its sunny its the beach for us!

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0092_rev_2.jpg"" width=""600"" />

With his scooter he is wobbly. But with his bike he is getting better. Not only is he standing on the pedal now for more
force to go up on ramps, he now put those feet on the frame and just uses his balance to guide his bike.

And no I cant take a photo cuz he is always swooshing away from me. So fast! I cant keep up unless I run!

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0100_rev_1.jpg"" width=""600"" />

Today we stayed till we see this lovely sunset.
Its not as pretty as the yellow hued sunset but its always special when I am seeing this with him.

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0103_rev.jpg"" width=""400"" />

My son is growing up so much in the past days and is going to be 6yr old in a few months.
He is doing so much in his own, discovering talents, skills and new interest.
He is copying my movements, joining me in my interest and finding his own style.
He is growing up in a rate that is so fast that I sometimes
scared to not be able to keep up. And the more he learn the more we realized that
theres so much more to learn and discover.

This is such an exciting time in his life.
And I am so glad to be able to experience it with him and be able to witness such development.
So much so that everyday really count.

I cant wait what is in store for us tomorrow!

My son is a bit clingy to me at the moment and wants my full attention in anything and everything which makes blogging a bit hard.
But of course there are moments when he would find a new toy and it would take his attention away from me. Thats when I do chores or blogging.

While I was typing trying to comment on the linkys that I joiuned this week I heard a familiar tune.
Walking in the air. We watched the movie yesterday as we cant go out much because of the rainy weather.
Its him! Getting the tune right! Just by tinkering and listening to the sound that the key makes!


<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0069_rev.jpg"" width=""600"" />

I then run to the cams and just took some vid without setting the light or the background.I dont want to lose the momentum.
hence the grainy photo and vid.
But I think its forgivable as this time its all about the sound. Here he is.

<lj-embed id=""152"" />
I know its short. Right about now he is still trying the other parts out. I am just so proud. I dont have talent in music at all!
Guess the violin lessons are going well. Now I am thinking maybe we chose the wrong instrument for him to learn =P

We are going to the beach every afternoon when the tourist are gone.
Its not that we dont like sharing the seafront with people but its really hard to get my son out of the house.
We are always planning to go since lunch time and with all his excuses the only time we can go is 5 in the afternoon!

We are either using the bike or scooter as I want him to get use to it.
I am planning on using them when we go back to school as we can finally use the promenade with the warmer weather.

And he is better!
I thought that he would forget using it but he didnt
and he is doing the standing up while pedalling which he cant do before.

Awesome!

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0072_rev.jpg"" width=""600"" />

And here he is trying his bike prowess on the sand which did not work =P

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0082_rev_1.jpg"" width=""600"" />

But he can still pose like he conquered the battle! He requested a photo of him on top of this!
Like extreme games!

And of course I would take photos while he is playing on the sand!
Like these!!!

And here I am thinking that Harry Potter with a Death Eater is on the beach?
Nope its a family enjoying the view!

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0073_rev_2.jpg"" width=""600"" />


This is what we have been doing.
Enjoying the sand and the fact that we live near the beach
and that the weather is finally giving us a chance to enjoy that advantage!

The home front is not as fun as the beachfront so its a nice near escape.
Nights are made up of quarrels and cold war. Going back home is a chore to me and my son.
I wish we dont have to go back but we need to. I wish we can just stay at the beach forever but we cant.
Or can we?

My word of the week is Beach.

We all have ways on how we read books. In one corner with a cuppa or in bed with the side lamp. I love reading mine sitting by the window as I have poor eyesight and when the book is scary I can always look out of the window and see people and I will not get scared anymore (yes scary books really scares me!).

Well this is how my son read his. We got a new book from his pocket money and since its sunny he asked if we could stay in the park to read it. I let him be and I tried taking photos of the daisies around us. Everytime I go back he would be in a different position!

Kids eh!

Tuesday and Wednesday school run was bad for me and my son this week.
Its raining hard and its cold. Using an umbrella is not an option too as the wind would just blow it away.
And our coats are no longer that waterproof after being washed so many times.
When I got home its miserable and then school run in the afternoon is a repeat of the morning one.
This is when living near the beach is not so nice. A curse.

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0082_rev.jpg"" width=""400"" />

Thursday is a wee bit different! In the morning its sunny!
Both of us just tried to soak up the sun. Hopped our way to school.
When I picked my son up in the afternoon the weather is so nice that he doesnt need a coat at the beach!

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0073_rev_1.jpg"" width=""600"" />

And look at the bright sky and the fluffy clouds! School run is not so bad and living near the beach does have its advantages.
Like being able to walk in there in school run while some people needs to drive just to experience the sands.

And there are lots of people who dropped by!
School ended this Friday for us and we cant wait for the term break to rest and recover!
Hopefully the weather would be friendlier! And we will have another week (or 2) of nice blue fluffy clouded sky!

Sebastian,

if you are old enough and is reading this.

I love you.

I want to go away, to not affect you with my hatred to your father but I cant go away and leave you because I dont know how to live without you anymore. Adults. They change. Adults would start to be in love with each other but time and reasons changes that and they would no longer love each other. And then hate.&nbsp; But you,

I love you.

You are the only right thing that this relationship gave me. You. Your smile. Your imagination. Your ideas, dreams, goals and visions. You. You are my super hero who saves me from darkness everyday. You are my amazing little boy. Sometimes I wonder where you got your heart and kindness from when your father and I doesnt have any of those. Especially lately.

I love you.

The only reason why I am staying alive is that so I can give mine to you when you need it. If you need it I will give it to you. No questions.
But at the end of the day I am only human and I made mistake and experience mistakes. Humans get hurt and reacts to that pain.

I love you.

Right now my arms are aching to hug you. Im sorry that you are not blessed with perfect <strike>parents</strike> mother.
But everyday I am trying hard to be a good one. Some days I win. There are days when I dont. But in those days the only reason why I try again is because,

I love you.

And I get tired of doing so many things but I wont get tired of loving you.

Mom.

My word of the week is Love.
I wrote this to my son when he heard me and my husband fighting.
He said stop fighting! But we did continue anyways. This is my sorry letter to him =(
Update: I read this to my son and he cried and he hugged me really really tight.
I guess I dont need to wait till he is older to understand.

After eating so much chocolate we need to burn the sugar and we decided to go out even if the weather is a bit bonkers.
Luckily by the time we are out the sun went out!

We went to our usual place. Grove Park and my son brought his camera as he wants to capture flowers and birds.

It got so sunny that my son needs to take off his jacket! And take photos is what we did!

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0087_rev.jpg"" width=""400"" />

And when he saw some cute flowers he got some for me! I love this shot of him.
I was about to take a photo of him sitting down and he just suddenly stand up to give me a bunch of those white small blooms!


<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0133_rev_1.jpg"" width=""400"" />

After which he run around the grass. He got this idea that his kiddie camera can be a GoPro.
He so want a GoPro but this will do for now =P

It got too cold again and the sky suddenly went dark. Its time for us to go.
I ask him to hold the flowers so that I can put the cams inside my bag.
But I just have to take few more shots of him!

The weather might not be the best and we werent able to go out for egg hunts but this outing is awesome nonetheless.
Anywhere is fun as long as I am with this little one.

Its been a week of eating for my little boy here. All he did the whole week is raid the fridge and ask for food!
And would even eat pasta without sauce!
Safe to say that he is really recovering.

My posts and insta feed are all about him as well.
I never go out now without the cams and everytime I look at the viewfinder he is there being cute and photogenic or <a href=""http://pixiedusk.livejournal.com/416045.html"" target=""_blank"">maybe not haha.</a>

We had a pee accident last Monday which upsets the both of us. Not something major but upsetting nonetheless.
I again think that I didnt react well. I should have thought that he had his swimming lesson which he probably drunk a lot of pool water.
Between getting back to school and school run theres really not much time for him to have a wee.
So a bit of wee went into his pants and the rest on a wall on our way home.
I told him to always listen to his body so that there wont be any accident in the future and he said he will while sobbing.
Every day we are learning of course. Sometimes I would look at him and see a big boy turning into a little man but
in reality of course is that while he is growing fast he is still a boy that has so much to learn and is learning every day.

Everyday its just him and me facing what the world throws at us.

And I love it!
I love that we are going out, exploring and he is eating and being silly in front of the cams and
he has time to go back to his old self ( hopefully even better).

And mostly I love that we are both learning about ourselves while we are experiencing life together.

It feels so cold today but we decided to still venture out.
I already washed and is stored the thick jackets but I need to bring them out again so that we can be comfortable in this trip.

In one of our school run I am noticing the shops and stalls on the beach going back and we went there to have a nosy.
And inspite of the gloomy day the beach is awash with colors from the rides and shops that is back from its winter rest.

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0073_rev.jpg"" width=""600"" />

And of course no gloomy day can stop a child from enjoying the sands!

We are most delighted by the sight of the donkeys! They are back!
My son is consoling Clover as everyone have gone for a walk.
My son stayed with her till the other donkeys are back.

My son actually want to have a ride with Clover but we didnt bring enough cash.
He said the donkeys will be gone but I told him they will start being there from now on.
And Clover will wait for him!

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0110_rev.jpg"" width=""600"" />

We just watch them from a distance.

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0114_rev.jpg"" width=""600"" />

We walked a bit more but was reminded that its time for lunch with this massive sign!
We are enjoying the life that is coming back to the seafront.
Its nice to have the beach for ourselves this winter but its even nicer when there are people sharing the sights with us.
Spring means blooms starting to wake up but spring in the beach means people going back to visit.

People and the energy &amp; vibe they give just makes me feel more alive. I am really use to crowd in my country.
Cant wait for them to come back and I wish that they will come back really soon!

Last week Thursday my son went back to school because he has got just enough energy (after being sick for a week) and the first thing that he asked me while I am dressing him is &#39;Is it Monday?&#39;.

I think he finds it weird that he is starting school on a Thursday.

This week we really did start everything on a Monday. And its so nice to be back to our normal routine after being both sick. And my son has been raiding the fridge the whole week too meaning he is eating a lot.

His education has suffered so much this school year too. After being absent for a week and a half fom chicken pox and another week for fever he missed so much. He got his reading gauge last Friday and he stayed the same because the teacher said he cant answer the questions regarding the book. My son was so sad and told me that he was so tired while they are reading thats why he doesnt understand the book at all. I am blaming myself for this as I know he is not that well and yet I already sent him to school. All of his classmates are moving forward and he is not. Its just that he has been telling me how bored he is and I want to have some time to fumigate the house thats why I send him back to school last week. I changed the sheets and tried to clean everything while he is in school.

I am wishing that this is the last of the bug that we are going to get. In his healthiest my son is already the smallest in his class. After being sick he lost so much weight and its so heartbreaking to see his body now. I just want his body to fully recover. And I am so lost on how to do this. I feel so vurnerable to all this sickness that is going around! Its like getting sick every week is the trend for us. Hopefully not.

Back to school is my word/s of the week.

There have been a lot of changes in our life lately but the only thing constant at the moment is that number 11 under his nose.
But he still looks cute dont you think!

This trip to the beach for us is something special.
For one we have been holed up in the house for the whole week because we are sick
and we cant really go out much because we dont have the energy and we dont want to spread our virus around.

And for the first time since we can remember or forever its sunny and the wind is not biting cold.
But just right not to make the sun hurt the skin as well.
SPRING!
For the first time in a very very long time we can wear just a thin jacket too!

And when there&#39;s sun we are out to enjoy it and a lot of other families&#39; thinking the same and the beach is beaming with people!

I know that this weather might or might not stay but giving us one warm day before we start our week is welcomed!
I feel like I am ready to tackle the week ahead with Vitamin D as my weapon ha!

Hope you had a fun and sunny Sunday too!

Sebastian woke up sluggish last Saturday and basically stayed that way till lunch.
I had an idea to go out just to make him wee bit perky.
We went to a park near us. We were blessed with a sunny weather too.
Something that is not happening a lot lately.
I notice how he is always wearing this green jacket and hat. His fave at the moment as the jacket reminds him of Minecraft
and of course the hat has cool batman ears.

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0077_rev.jpg"" width=""600"" />

He did perk up and wont stop running in the park. Giving me a sweet smile on every photo that I shoot.

<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0096_rev.jpg"" width=""400"" />

But once in awhile you can see that he is not feeling well.

When we got home he went back to being sluggish and it continued.
He is sick since then with fever and basically stayed on bed or on the sofa.
Something new because he is always jumping around even when he&#39;s got fever.
I reckon he&#39;s got flu and he really needs massive rest.
He got enough energy to still greet me Happy Mothers Day and kissed and hugged me really really tight the next day.
He is clingy and would always asked to be carried and I realized how big and tall he is now.

He is growing really really fast. Faster than I am ready for.
I am trying to enjoy every moment.
While he still enjoy my company because I know soon he will need to expand
his world and spend more time with friends, school and classmates.

Hello again.


<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0140_rev.jpg"" width=""600"" />

You might be wondering what had happened to me. Most active then suddenly gone. As you might have known I am forever homesick and frustrated of the situation I am in relationship and marriage wise. Last August a month before my birthday it got worse. It must be the sadness that on my birthday I won&#39;t be with someone who gave birth to me. Since then I have spent my whole day and night sleeping. I would wake up for school run and do it but would just lie on the sofa. Daydreaming, sleeping, escaping. Call it what you want but I am lifeless. I am in a Coma.


When I stand up its like there are shackles on my feet and it&#39;s very hard for me to stand.
Like someone is pulling me down. Like I am carrying the world on my shoulders.

Heavy.


Life is so heavy.


So I don&#39;t stand unless it&#39;s time to pick up my son from school. After which I would squeeze all the chores that I need to fond then feed him and then sleep again during the night with my son. That the cycle of my life. My pants won&#39;t fit me anymore as I don&#39;t have movement at all whatsoever.


For months and months I am like that, a sleeping beauty.


Until I saw this.
A photography competition. You can win a camera. An amazing one.

<lj-embed id=""143"" />

I dont know why. But inside me I just know that I need to win that camera. That maybe I have a chance. Maybe I am losing on so many aspects on my life but I can win on something. Suddenly after so many months of being asleep I am awake. I started thinking. I havent done that in awhile. Ideas flowed.
What is design, craftmanship. I looked around me and I saw things beyond what they are. I saw how the things around me are created. The hands that made them.

I started taking photos of those. And joined and went back to blogging posting pictures of course!

<lj-embed id=""144"" />

<lj-embed id=""145"" />

<lj-embed id=""146"" />

And i ventured out. I ... I took some photos of the things that are not created by hands too.

<lj-embed id=""147"" />

And the one that I have helped created.


<lj-embed id=""148"" />

Somewhere in the middle of the competition after seeing the other entries I wanted to give up.
<lj-embed id=""150"" />
But there are so many people who supported me and told me not to.
They commented on how I should not give up on my dreams.
Somehow I believed them and I did not stop taking more photos.



And then suddenly though things are still really really bad in my marriage, suddenly I have something to run on to when everything is overwhelming.
To some people taking photos are an expression.

To me its life saving.

To me, it woke me from the coma that has been eating me.

I did not win the camera. This <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BCXp8dlly_7/?taken-by=olympusuk"" target=""_blank"">guy</a> did. But I am really really thankful that this competition has come my way (destiny perhaps?).
Because even if I did not win the prize I won something.

I won over the depression that has been plaguing my head.

I won back me.

"event","<div style=""text-align: center;"">I FINALLY got a chance to get out of town and visit Bristol with my son. Like a very hungry caterpillar I took photos like there&#39;s no tomorrow and my son is just being behave! Amazing. All he did (while I am taking photos) was to read the books on top of the tables.

One side of the Choir Area in the Bristol Cathedral is basking with sunshine and the other side is a bit hidden so I got photos of him in different lights!

Its always a mystery to me as to why this tree is full of shoes.
And then I realized that the shoes that are hanging in there are old shoes of the skater who uses this area.
I need a new one to be honest haha and the thought of getting just one pair is orbitting in my head.
Now how do a 5feet girl climb this massive tree?
<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0071_rev.jpg"" width=""400"" />


Banksy! That is what my son said upon seeing this artwork.
He is familiar with him as he saw Dismaland.
Part of me wants to lift up that can of paint just to see the Angel&#39;s face.
Or is there even a face in there?
We will never know.
<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0125_rev.jpg"" width=""400"" />


Nothing quirky in here really, we (me and my son) want to go up
but I am carrying 3 bags so I cant bring my son.
He said &#39;I wish we can fly so that we can go up there.&#39;
I wish that that too!
<img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v455/pixiedusk/pixiedusk030/_DSC0190_rev.jpg"" width=""400"" />


And then this bridge with locks.
I think from now on designers and engineers needs to add the load of the locks when designing a bridge as it is now a norm.
Also they should consider the rust dont they?
So while we are tinkering with the locks my son ask &#39;Mummy who is C*nt?&#39;
And then I replied &#39;Oh look seagulls!!!&#39;

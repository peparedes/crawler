"event","The whole campus has emptied out, and I like it. There's something so nice about this place being deserted that is so peaceful - and so much like a cheap, crappy scary movie.&nbsp; I'm almost done with my afghan, and I have all day of doing nothing yet again to finish it.&nbsp; It's not exactly to my liking, but then again, it's not my blanket.&nbsp; I intended to finish it yesterday, but I got sucked into Harry and Snape lovliness and wound up rather....distracted."

"event","I'm doing absolutely nothing other than just relaxing and having a good time.&nbsp; I think that it's probably fairly important to enjoy my last few days here, so I'm taking my time packing, trying to see my friends, and working all the hours I can.&nbsp; I love it that working involves so much sitting around doing nothing, because that gives me time to read smut and crochet.&nbsp; This is living the good life...."

"event","So this is the first time I've done this whole livejournal thingy, and I feel a bit lost. I doubt anyone will read this, but if someone does and feels like lending a hand to a poor, lost soul, just let me know. I'd appreciate any help I can get. So I'm graduating this weekend. This seems like it should be an astoundingly happy event, but all of a sudden, it's not. I just realized that I have to have insurance, (yes, I know I should have thought about this a long, long time ago) but it wasn't an issue before. Before, I knew what I was going to be doing, and insurance wasn't something that I needed to worry about. Now, all of a sudden I'm thinking about going to grad school, but to stay on my parent's plan, I have to be a full time student. The problem with that is that if I'm a 3/4 time student, it's cheap as hell, but if I'm full time, it's expensive as balls. What to do? Fuck if I know. The main purpose of creating this blasted journal is that I read today on Switchknife's journal about how obnoxious it is for fanfic writers to have ""invisible readers."" Most of the reason that I don't review the fics I read is because they would be anonymous, and I don't want to do that. So here I am. I'm going to start reviewing. Yay me."

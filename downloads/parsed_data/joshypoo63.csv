"event","I guess these things are supposed to be used to spill your guts about things that have happened to you or things you want to talk about, so i'm gonna spill my guts about something that has been bugging me for a while. The Girl i'm in love with. So in 7th grade i got introduced to this girl, she was cute, she was funny, we always had a good time together, and i liked her alot. In 8th grade, i started to like her more, hang out with her more, do things i wasn't supposed to do, and more and more i got to like her, we've even promisd eachother that we're going to senior prom together. High school we didn't talk as much, i had football, she had her things to do, skating, whatever. Then last year, we got to talking again, and i started to like her again, and she was goin' out with this guy that i really didn't like, but she was in love with him, so i didn't say anything, i just let her do what she wanted, i mean i told her i didn't like him, but i didn't ask her to break up with him until they were about to break up anyhow. So this year of high school, junior year i've come to see that i'm really in love with this girl, and everytime i'm around her, i just, i can't even explain it, everything she does makes me love her more and more. I've told her that i'm in love with her, that i want her more than anyhting in the world, i've done most everything that i could to make her see how much i care about her, and she's said that she cares about me too, but now she likes this other guy, and he's a soccer player and he's a cool guy, and i always hear about her and what she does with this guy, and i know how one of the bffs feels now, and i'm apoligizing for what i've done to that bff, but anyhow, i haven't really said anything to her about this dude or about how i don't want her to go out with him, and this really sounds like high school drama, immature type stuff, but i'm hoping that she'll read this and it might have an effect on her, if it doesn't, that that's it, this is really my last effort to get her to know how i feel, and this is the last effort to try to get closer to her until prom. SO with that said and off my chest, i am going to go eat some marshmallows."

"event","Yes! Score, i can be called a bff now! I have this cool name that has my name in it, i mean, how much cooler than that can you get right?! SO other than being the man, and a bff, that didn't get to go to the bff day today, because i dont know why, but anyhow. OH this is exciting though, but i kinda feel like a girl having this sweet thing right hurr, but it's all good because i know i'm not, and i know i'm the ""MAN"" so that makes me feel much better! Ok guys i'm gonna go now! I hope you like my new coolness PEACE!"

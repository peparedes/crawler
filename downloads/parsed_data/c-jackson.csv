"event","Yeah. I was told that if I didn't update sometime soon, I was gonna get 'it'. Whatever 'it' is. To be honest, I was really lookin' forward to 'it'. I shouldn't even be doin' this right now, but I'm whipped.

By now, you should-a all been out and copped that D-12 album because it's a real tight album. I ain't think there's any song on there that I don't like. Maybe that's jus' me though, and I'm biased when it comes to my people.

As for me, I'm writin' for my next album but it won't be out for awhile now. I think it's the smart thing-ta do since Em's been workin' on his and let me tell you all that if you thinkin' of releasin' an album within the next couple of months, don't. 'Cause his shit is definitely gon' blow up. I jus' thought I'd let you all know 'fore you all go an' get your hopes up.

I promised my son that I'd spend the day wit' him, so I gotta get goin'. Maybe I'll sign on sometime-ta hit on all you females. I mean, what's good Willa? :D

Aight, why did I just try to spell check this entry as if I had any hope-a catchin' a literate error."

"event","It's time for me to be updatin' this thing. I been through a lot a shit in jus' these past couple-a weeks. Good an' bad. I been down to Australia an' lost my voice. I had no control over that shit. But I still managed to rap more than Ja did when he was down there. Ha. He usually lip sync's most of his shit an'way. Then there's the Grammys. That I ain't expect at all. I ain't gon' lie, It would be pretty fuckin' hot to own one of them. I ain't gon be like 'Oh, I'm just honored to be nominated' You know when someone be sayin' that, it's bull. I hate to talk 'bout Ja an' shit cause he ain't nobody to be talkin' 'bout but he still talkin' mad shit. It ain't jus' that cause now he's gettin' other people to turn on me too. If I can remember right, ain't he the one who wanted to mediate tension? Ha.

I find it real funny that I try an' spell check after writin' an update. All you be seein' is red."

"event","It's about time I update this shit. I ain't got much to say but Imma try 'n' work somethin' out.

Let's see. I'm bein' sued. That's always some fun shit-ta go through. People always tryna get a piece-a you. An' they do some crazy shit just to get it too. So this photographer who just happened-ta be 'n' the wrong place at the wrong time got hurt. When you think 'bout it, my security was only doin' what they get paid for, which is protectin' me. Ha. An' the other thing is, this shit happened a long time ago. He just now filin' the lawsuit. How dumb can you be, shit.

An'way, I hope you all cop the new G-Unit album. If not, ya should. It's a hot one. I think Imma be callin' it a night. Imma also make sure ta be 'round more often. One."

"event","People are really shady nowadays. They wanna talk shit behind your back an' think they all hot shit an' shit. But the real truth is, they ain't. In fact, they ain't nothin' but pussies. All of 'em. Especially Ja. The fuck he think. I was actually gon' show up an' 'mediate tension'. Fuck that shit. I ain't the one who need the publicity. He brought all-a this shit upon himself an' now he gotta deal wit the consequences. Now I respect Minister Farrakhan but as far as shit goes with Ja an' I an' makin' up. It ain't happenin' any time soon.

Aight. Enough-a that bitch. TRL this week. Betta watch that. I'll make sure to update before then though. An' the album will be out the 14th now so cop that shit. I'm out for now. Elisha an' I are runnin' away to Vegas an' gettin' hitched. Imma see if Minster Farrakhan can hook a brotha up."

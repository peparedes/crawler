"event","As a keen cyclist, an adrenaline junkie and someone with little regard for my own safety, I love nothing more than grabbing my long-suffering bike - a Frankenstein&#39;s monster of various models - and rocketing off in search of The Next Big Adventure.

Having done The West Highland Way on a whim (I had already left the house before I decided to do it. I had no idea how long it would take or the terrain I would encounter, which was severe, to put it mildly!), and cycled in a near permanent headwind to Inverness, toured Penrith and Shap, and made myself overly familiar with the area twixt Arrochar and Inverary, the next sensible thing to do is obviously cycle the length of the country, like you do...

But before that, an intermediate distance, methinks. I love London, in all it&#39;s smelly, bustling glory, so it was a no-brainer that the capital city should be the starting point. And what could be better than arriving home at the end of several days of pedal-punishment, hot bath and (several hundred) cups of tea? I had originally considered doing it the other way round, but there&#39;s something quite dismal about arriving somewhere hundreds of miles from home, cold, probably wet, tired and sore, having to rely on hotel accommodation.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">London to Glasgow</span></b>
6 days, 720 km (448 miles), via Milton Keynes, Birmingham, Stoke, Manchester, Penrith, Carlisle and Lockerbie.
1st-6th of May 2013. I will mostly be travelling on <a href=""http://www.sustrans.org.uk/what-we-do/national-cycle-network"">The National Cycle Network</a> routes 6 and 7.

<span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><b><a href=""http://www.cycle-endtoend.org.uk/"">End-to-End</a></b></span>
10-14 days, 1465 km (910 m), via Inverness, Perth, Gretna, Kendal, Wolverhampton, Gloucester and Taunton.
Spring 2014. I&#39;m interested in doing this route for charity and I&#39;m looking for sponsors, both corporate and private. Please email me if you&#39;re interested in donating.

To train, I cycle the Union Canal towpath between Edinburgh and Glasgow, always aiming for a sub-five hour time. Touch wood, I&#39;ve yet to end up in the water, though I&#39;ve come very close when it&#39;s muddy!
My bike is a humble mountain bike. The frame, saddle post and handlebars are the only original parts.


<span style=""font-size:0.7em;"">This journal entry is created in part for my own safety: in the unlikely event that I should get hopelessly lost/injured/eaten by a big cat, the above information will give the search and rescue folks and idea of where to start looking. Due to battery-lifespan and network coverage, it&#39;s possible that I may be incommunicado for the entire duration of each trip.</span>"

"event","One bright sunny night, the APED turtles were shimmying down a particularly long bin pipe, when Fedox spotted a minion of the North Wind prying open orange violins with a jelly crowbar, presumably to reach the rich deposits of babbironium that, as you probably know, is found mostly in orange - and to a lesser extent, purple - violins. Searching for babbironium without a guinea pig is very illegal, and Fedox couldn&#39;t smell a guinea pig for miles around, so he fluffed his spines and danced angrily to the minion.
The minion was a small, pale-veridian gust of north-easterly wind, slightly squally, but without a bread hat. The normal custom for North Windian minions, when confronted by a law-enforcement officer, is to bow until their nose is level with the height of their guinea pig when it&#39;s standing on it&#39;s hind legs and hopping in time with the theme tune to Mork And Mindy. However, this minion didn&#39;t have a guinea pig, nor a nose, so Fedox and Teycanwyn began the normal procedure for breech of protocol.
&quot;Here, hold this.&quot; Fedox handed his partner a slapstick, a long, thin piece of a green tee-shirt spat on by low-flying nuns, and unfurled a tell-scroll from his pouch. &quot;State your name,&quot; he said to the minion.
&quot;Don&#39;t got one,&quot; the squall replied huffily.
&quot;Right, Doan Gotwon, you are in breech...&quot;
&quot;Nah, nah, nah, I mean, I don&#39;t got a name.&quot;
&quot;What the garf do you mean you don&#39;t have a name?! How the garf can you not have a name?!&quot;
The squall shrugged. &quot;Dunno. Just don&#39;t got one.&quot;
Fedox rolled his eyes. &quot;Right. Fine. Put a gust of wind here.&quot; He pointed to a spot on the tell-scroll.
&quot;D&#39; I &#39;ave to?&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;
&quot;Whyzzat?&quot;
&quot;So we can arrest you.&quot;
&quot;So...if I don&#39;t put my gust down, you can&#39;t arrest me?&quot;
Teycanwyn stepped forward, spines raised threateningly. &quot;We&#39;ll do worse than arrest you, you little trib!&quot; he growled, making sure the squall could see both the slapstick and Teycanwyn&#39;s vivid scar which ran from the edge of his spines to his top lip.

To be continued..."

How beautiful the day that you caught these paper fish, their noses and tails shown of pure softening. Plus to nought, we soften further, and sway, now down, from side to up. Cellar door, cellar door, cellar door. You cry with all your might, yet the pine cones never answer. They instead heed the crisp rustle of true cellophane, and languish in Velcro doors.

"event","&nbsp;Given infinite money/resources what would you do in life?

I'll start you off: I'd have the cunts in the flat above tortured to death for noise pollution. And it would be nasty torture, not the &quot;family friendly&quot; shit you see in the Saw films. I'm talking REAL pain. The kind you can't even persuade LSD addled bad-trippers to have nightmares about.

I'd also invest in some population control. Human beings are so quick to gas/shoot &quot;excess&quot; rabbits or badgers or whatever, but what about the fact that there are SEVEN BILLION humans crawling over the surface of a rock than can comfortably hold no more than four billion. Tops. Where are those trigger-happy fuckers now, eh?

I'd also ban coin jingling. Anyone caught rattling coins in their pocket would immediately have both of their hands cut off, no questions asked. And no, none of the above would be eligible for benefits.

Fuck you very much."

"event","A dozen male ballet dancers in expensive suits greeted me this morning. Without waiting for an invite (or, more likely, instruction on exactly where they could shove their fucking stupid shoes) they barged into my flat and began jumping around and pirouetting all over the place. Unsurprisingly, the dancing bitches who arrived yesterday are fucking delighted. Even less surprisingly, I&rsquo;m leaving. I quickly packed a bag and just walked out. Fuck &lsquo;em. I&rsquo;m going to stay at my mum and dad&rsquo;s place for a bit, until I&rsquo;m well rested and, with any luck, the cops come back and clear out all the nutters with the drums and bagpipes. And the birds.
Just before I left, I noticed an envelope on the doormat. Inside was the following letter:

&ldquo;My dearest love,
I hope you liked your presents, it took me ages to find everything. You would not believe the lengths one has to go to, to find so many swans! I particularly hope you liked the rings. They belonged to the five last kings of Burma and are absolutely priceless, so don&rsquo;t lose them.
I apologise for not sending food before all those people arrived. It rather slipped my mind, but should arrive the day after the lords-a-leaping. There will be enough to feed everyone and all of the birds for a several weeks. Oh, and don&rsquo;t eat the goose eggs. Those geese have a rather nasty illness which unfortunately passes into their eggs. The result would be extremely unpleasant for whomever eats them. Both ends, if you catch my drift. Again, apologies for the lack of advance warning.
The eggs that the chickens produce are quite safe to eat, but they don&rsquo;t lay often. I got them during a recent jaunt to Paris and I&rsquo;m afraid to say they certainly share their countrymen&rsquo;s capricious temperament.
Hope to see you very soon,
Your true love xxx&rdquo;"

Worse still, the police showed up and told me that if I didn&rsquo;t cut down the noise, I&rsquo;d be arrested for breach of the peace! I tried to tell them that it wasn&rsquo;t my fault, but they weren&rsquo;t interested. They said I had twenty-four hours to &ldquo;comply&rdquo;, or else face the consequences."

"event","This morning I was woken by the sound of what I thought was perhaps a parade or march of some kind. It turned out to be about ten people all playing bagpipes and demanding entry to my &ldquo;abode&rdquo;. Where are these freaks coming from?! I have given up on the prospect of ever getting any real sleep ever again. With the drummers and the pipers, the noise is deafening.
I&rsquo;m getting regular complaints from the neighbours and I got a letter from the housing association notifying me of their intent to &ldquo;take further action&rdquo; if I don&rsquo;t re-home my &ldquo;pets&rdquo; within one week! I wrote a reply saying that they weren&rsquo;t my pets and I&rsquo;d be more than happy for someone to come and remove them.
And now the drummers are complaining of stomach aches. I sent one of the pipers out to get some antacids, which he only agreed to do if he could take his bagpipes."

Worse still, I&rsquo;ve had to take time off work to look after the birds, which is now a full-time job in itself, compounded by the fact that today seven huge swans arrived today, going straight to the bathroom and jumping into the bath. Somehow one of them managed to turn on the tap and even put the plug in, so now they&rsquo;re sitting in the bath (which is not big nearly big enough to accommodate seven massive Hooper swans, leading to much flapping, honking, pecking, splashed water and, yep, you guessed it, strewn feathers). Is it even legal to have swans in your flat? Aren&rsquo;t they all technically owned by the Queen or something? Haven&rsquo;t seen the rabbit in a day or two. I guess he&rsquo;s done the smart thing and found somewhere to hide. Either that or he's making phabbits &gt;&lt;"

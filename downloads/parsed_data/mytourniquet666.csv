"event","Well,today was so busy and so fucked up,i would have to tell you in person to get it all out.Lets just say it was a great saturday before school.The highling of my day happened about 2 hours ago.See,earlier in the day me an Justin came across a Air Force dude skating in the mall parking lot,which is ""illegal"",and i put it in parenthesis because techically its not illegal,REAL cops see us doin it all the time and dont say nuthin,but the rent-a-cops got a major hard-on for us.Anyways,the rent-a-cops saw him in their car an they took off towards him,he saw em an went straight for Bank One,which is a safe-zone since your not on mall property anymore.Anyways,me an Justin jsu twent on the mall proprty and started skating since the car was ""gone"".Well,we got halfway through the parking lot an i heard...""SCREEEECH""...an it was her,the rent-a-cop in her car making a straight line towards me.i was about to take off when i slammed into the curb an rolled onto the grass.Anyways,we got off our boards an she followed us until we went into the mall,it pisses me off.Anyways,a little later we went outside an started skating again an our ol rent-a-cop buddy Chastin came by an didnt say a word,he just smiled at us an let us go.Of course we left the mall for about an hour,then came back to skate some more.Well,Chastin wasnt in the car anymore,it was Tons-Of-Fun an he was pissed.We walked for a bit an finally started skating again.Well,he came around the corner going straight for us.Justin poped his board up so he didnt see him,but i took off like a motherfucker making a straight line for Oxford Street,which was across the street from the mall,and Kaylas mom works there so i figured if the cops came after me,i could hide out in there.Anyways,i finally made it to the island in the middle of the street,OFF MALL PROPERTY,an i looked back an he was P-I-S-S-E-D.He went over to Justin an was talkin to him,the whole time i was just watching an laughing.Well,the rent-a-cop left an Justin was walking toward me.When we met,i asked him what Tons-Of-Fun said,an he told me that he said,""if your friend even comes on mall property with that board again,im gonna take it from him,no questions asked"",HAHAHAHAHA.Id like to see him try,do you knwo how fast i can skate?Obviously not.Anyways,we left the mall,an i was laughing SOOOOOOOOO hard.That was the highlight of my day,it was fanfuckintastic.Next time i see Tons-Of-Fun,i bet he trys an take it from me,an im just gonna say no,an walk away,an if it gets hostile,ima run,cause i know Kayla-pie wouldnt want me doin what id do if i was single,actually,if i was single,id be dead,cause i found a perfect way to kill myself today.Anywhoo,that was just one part of my amazing day,i thought about Kayla all day too,thats the only reason i had so much fun,bye everyone,hope you all die soon...I LOVE KAYLA,AN I DONT HOPE SHE DIES,NEVER EVER,I WANT HER TO LIVE FOREVER WITH ME."

"event","Well,today was quite a fuckin day wasnt it?it started off with a phonecall from Justin an Kyle,they were doin dishes so i just said fuck it an skated over to their place.Once there we drank a Sunkist ornge drink an skated away.We decided one last trip to Adams an then he was out of our group.This time though,he was home,along with this kid named Randy{he was in my tennis class in 7th grade,weve met,but i hate his fuckin guts cause he thinks hes my friend}.Anyways,we all sat down and things just got out of hand,after awhile everybody was jumping on everyone,it was mainly me Justin and Kyle,we just went insane.The worst time was when Justin was standing beside me an i was sitting down,an he pissed me off so i slammed my fist into his ribs an it knocked the breath outta him.Well,he got pissed too an so he punched me in my kidney or something,an ran over in front of Kyle an started laughing an talkin to him,so i got up and ran as fast as i could over to Justin and tackled him from behind onto Kyle,an i got up,but they were stuck an Justin was laughing still.That happened about 20 more times all on Adams couch.After awhile his sister{who was supposed to be hot,but shes sooooooooo not,not even by a little bit}came home an left her car running outside,haha,dumbass.So we all poured outside,Adam ran straight for the car an jumped inside,an took off,that motherfucker dont even have a learners permit yet,haha.He came back around the corner as fast as he could an we were all laughing so hard.He parked it three houses down an we all went back inside an ran to our places{which caused yet another dogpile}.After she found out,she got P-I-S-S-E-D an started yelling at him,so then he said,""it wasnt me,it was the goths"",which meant she started yelling at me an Justin.So after that he said,""alright,it wasnt them,it was Kyle"",an she started yelling at him.Finally she found out it was Adam an stomped outta the room.After about 3 hours at Adams,we got bored,so we just left an didnt tell him we were,haha.We skated to the mall an ducked inside.After awhile Kyle decided this,""oh,hey,i need a wrist thingy,ima go steal one from spencers"",what a fuckin dumbass,they just kicked us out yesterday an the guy who kicked us out is right there.So,he goes in an we ditch him.30 minutes later we come back an hes still trying to steal it,so we go in with him an were followed around the store like were black or something,its insane,and its bullshit.By the way,NO WHERE outside the mall does it say ""so skating"",it says ""no loitering"" and a couple other things,but NOTHING ABOUT SKATING,not a thing.I ran into Kayla{the sis} at the mall too,literally ran into her.We talked for awhile,but eventually we broke away an went seperate ways.I found the next thign of makup ina get from Hot Topic,an its the white shit for your face,i love that,Justin said,""no way,you are not gonna get that"",so now i have to get it for sure.Anyways,thats just a few things that happened today,the rest ill give ya later...Bye bithces...I LOVE KAYLA"

"event","Well,today i had a true adventure,see,at 12 Justin called me an told me Kyle was there,so,we met at our meeting spot an skated straight to the mall.At the mall,we skated around a bit an got so sweaty,so we ran inside.There we went into Spencers and ran into Mark Jackson,whom ive known for years,he was also the first person to tell me Ashley wasnt good for me,cause he was the first guy to date her here in town{or so she says}.Anyways,we were standing in the aisle and the guy who worked there came up to us an said,""hey,if you guys wanan talk,thats cool,but youd better not do it in here,buy somethin or leave"",so,as usual,we didnt move an inch.He came back an said,""alright,if you guys dont leave,were callin security"",an we couldnt afford that cause Mark wasnt supposed to be at the mall ever again,he got off probation like a week ago,long story.Anyways,as we were leaving,i knocked something off a shelf{on pourpose},and Justin said ""fuck you"" to the guy as we were leaving,so,therefore the guy went to get security,so,we bailed...at least we moved to the other end of the mall.Anyways,we sat on the couches an talked bout girls an skating and just random shit.Finally we agreed we were gonna get Mark an Kyle laid,just cause they were the only ones without girls{well,Mark has a girl,but all they do is fuck}.So,we found these two girls with the preppiest look and pinkest shirts,eww.Well,somehow Mark won them over by literally stalking them.Finally we all sat down on some couches,but i sat down on the table next to them,i didnt wanna be too close to them cause they kept staring at me.I never said a word to either of them but somehow it slipped out that i was engaged an they were all ""awww,thats so sweet"",so,at least i knew theyd quit looking at me...they didnt.Anyways,they left us all an Mark an Kyle were alone,which was funny.Mark pulled his pants up ALL the way to his chest,tucked his shirt in,an started acting like a very believeable retard.Of course,to ruin the fun,some lady came up to him an said,""thats not funny,my cousin is handicapped"",an Mark looked like he felt bad and started crying,but when she left,he started laughing.I think out of all of us,i stuck out the most on the goth side.I had black lipstick on,black eyeliner,black nail polish,a Marilyn Manson shirt on,black dress pants,my Ankh necklace,and my heartagram converse,yea,i stuck out.I feel like an outsider in every group im in though,just because i dont like being ""talkative"".IF I WANNA TALK ILL TALK,IF NOT,I WONT.Im not really shy,im just not what some people would call ""sociable"".I mean,im not shy cause i can hit on any girl,i can insult anyone,i can be a total asshole to basically anyone,but,i just dont feel like it,plus,im gettin married,so,yea.Anyways,i came home after all that shit,that lasted from 12 to 8 by the way,thats a damn long time.Anyways,ima take a shower now cause i stink of sweat and the skating made my makeup run,so,i shall leave you for now,but,i just gota say...YAY,I LOVE KAYLA"

"event","Well,today i skated more than i eve have in my life,and with skating,come injurys.So heres my check of my injurys for today...

Elbows-Hit my elbows on the ground after a boardslide,also after doing an old school trick they used to do back when skating was first invented.They started to bleed after i ollied the grass spot between Chuck E. Cheeses and a empty lot.

Knees-Hit knees on the ground in ditch,we were skating in the ditches behind the houses on k-mart drive and i ate shit because of a huge motherfucking water-pipe in the middle of the ditch,it just jumped out in front of me....somehow.

Nuts-Alright,i was skating up to a curb,and i kicked it away from me,it bounced off the curb an came back,so i decided to flip it up into my hands,well,i flipped it up and it hit me straight in my nuts.Second time,i was going up a hill and decided to do a little ""kick it away then land on it"" trick,or a ""sproing"" according to Tony Hawk.An it flipped up and hit me right uner my nuts,but it still hit them.Sorry Kayla,im sure i can still have children though...i hope.

Chest-I tried the ""sproing"" trick again an it flipped a bit too high an it slammed into my chest so hard i lost my breath.

Hip/Ass-I was skating down this road over by my house an i did my little ""lower myself on the board"" trick{i know you cant understand well,but bear with me}.Well,i lost total balance and landed on my hip then on my ass.I skidded on the cement for awhile,an that sucked.

Shoulder-I was skating down on the board and i SOMEHOW lost balance again,so i SOMEHOW did a FUCKING FLIP off the board and landed right on my left shoulder.

That was basically it,that sucked so fuckin bad though,BUT,im better now,ima skater and a vampire so i heal quick,haha.So,till next time,so suck a cock you ass-fucking fuckos....I LOVE KAYLA WITH ALL MY HEART,WE'LL BE TOGETHER FOREVER AND EVER AND A DAY AND TODAY"

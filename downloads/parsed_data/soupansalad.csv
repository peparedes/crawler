It's 4 months in, 2 months away from doing my internship, and I feel like I'm one step closer to achieving one (hopefully) hard-earned goal. It's settled for now. Gulf News.<br /><br />Aside from that, I'm pretty much occupied with the long and tedious process of producing a documentary as well as a short film. I would be lying if I said I'm not mentally and physically drained from the hectic schedule, but I would sin if I said I haven't enjoyed every single second of it.&nbsp;<div>&nbsp;</div><div>Documentary is my passion. I take pleasure in knowing that Alfred Hitchcock said, &quot;In feature films, the director is God, but in documentaries, God is the director.&quot; &nbsp;You get to enjoy the thrills of uncertainty, very much so in the Cinema Verite technique. I've only gotten the opportunity to watch 3 documentaries in class since the semester starts, but I am certain to say that my love grew&nbsp;with each subsequent documentary, as they reveal a hidden nature of art expressed by different unique individuals. I aspire to be that individual who would be able to tell a story of another through an artistic lens and draw an impact on members of the audience who watch, but most importantly, &quot;feel&quot; the documentary.&nbsp;</div>"

Her family has been so generous and caring towards me and it was awfully nice of them to offer me to come to Jordan, all-expense paid trip. God Bless their family!<br /><br />The other half of the break, in which I had a choice to whether return to SG or tag along with my mum and her friends to Europe, is something that I hope will rejuvenate my home-sickness!

I can&#39;t even bring myself to act as one person. Why must we have all these masks as part of keeping us &quot;sane&quot;? If anything, that would only thrash our esteem. We would then find ourselves lost in transition.

"event","It&#39;s the start of a new semester today. New courses, new people, new environment. It seems like we are bound to go through this cycle every 6 months. Changes happen after 6 months, nothing stays the same. It is scary to even think that your feelings will remain the same after 6 months. It is almost likely that I feel reborn. Last semester was awesome. I made new great friends from the Sudanese Club, attended the Global Day with them and thought that the new-made friendships will be something I bring with me up to my graduation. But sadly, a few of them are transferring, one of them passed away, the rest remain in state of disbelief and sadness. The youth and vitality that was present from before seemed to have been sucked into the realms of life.&nbsp; Nevertheless, being a firm believer of Islam (InshaAllah), I believe in the Hereafter and I believe that the challenges that happen in this world are part of increasing our <em>iman</em>, to realise the existence of the Most Righteous and the Most Merciful."

Mutasim Amara, or also known to be Afros by most of his loved ones, left us family and friends on the first day of Ramadhan, while Sima Al-Jundi, on her way to Aleppo to purchase hijabs (weeks after she expressed her intent to start wear hijabs permanently) , met with an accident on Friday, the last 7th day of Ramadhan, 5 days after her birthday. <em>SubhanAllah.</em><br /><br />I am truly sad that I have never got the chance to know these two kind-hearted souls on a personal level, though I had conversed with them on a few occasions (Sima and I attended class together last semester). <em>MasyaAllah</em>, both of them made a lasting impact on me with their sweet and angelic smiles even though I was almost a stranger to them. For someone who did not foster close ties with&nbsp; them before their departure, it is already heartbreaking for me to hear of their sad demise, and cannot begin to imagine what it must be like for her loved ones. The overwhelming response (mostly shock and sadness) from family, friends and colleagues all over just shows how wonderful these 2 people were before. I pray, from the bottom of my heart, that Allah s.w.t grant them the straight passage to Jannah and also the strength for his/her family and friends to go through this painful ordeal.<br /><br />One thing I'm certain of is that Allah s.w.t loves them more.<br /><br /><em><strong>Al-Fatihah.</strong></em>"

France, Greece, New York, LA, you name it. I would even imagine settling down&nbsp; in one of those countries, having a successful career and a happy marriage altogether. Haha, too good to be true ain't it?<br /><br />But this dream keeps me on my feet and I find myself basking in the renewed sense of energy to live life. Isn't that what life satisfaction should be about? To embark in different journeys in life and foster new relationships with anyone and everyone that cross your path. That's how we learn the essence of life per se. You'll be surprised how a few new encounters can alter your life perception in a way that favors your own mental growth.<br /><br />I'm not saying you have to be thousands of miles away from home and your loved ones to be able to realize this dream. Heck, with globalisation up to speed, we are all connected in an overwhelming degree that you don't have to be out and about to learn about the world. At the end of the day, the means in which you prefer lies in your own best interest. <br /><br />As for me, InshaAllah, I'd like to experience the cultures of the world first hand. Having a Sudanese roommate and a Palestinian-Jordanian bestfriend, I feel grateful enough to have created such close bonds with these wonderful beings.&nbsp; My hunger for intercultural knowledge has given me the strength and courage to have chosen a university in the UAE, but it doesn't just end here.

I couldn't even enjoy a decent live match of AUS vs AUD (i forced a fake cheer and it sounded pathetic) even after Tumi and I treated ourselves to a caramel frappe...makes me wonder whether caffeine can take a reverse effect of sucking the fun out of you....but kudos to martin and doom  who managed to hype me up eventually with their epic jokes. keep it up guys......................<br /><br /><em>When you're too in love to let it show<br />But if You Never Try You'll Never Know<br />Just what you're worth<br /><br /></em><br /><br />"

"event","I know, I know. I haven't done enough justice by updating this journal with mere pictures rather than concrete words of wisdom/reflection. A lot of thought has been put into whether I should set up another journal aside, specially for me to outpour my thoughts and sentiments addressing anything from social, political&nbsp;to self-revelation issues that compel me to pen them down on that particular mean of expression. I might come across as being a late bloomer in the writing world, but I've always managed to convince myself that&nbsp;I'm fully&nbsp;equipped with the means for me to expand my creativity, and that I could and&nbsp;should take up this challenge. And so I did. I opened a new blog weeks ago,&nbsp;determined to bring across to readers aside from myself what I never thought one could do as an aspiring writer&nbsp;: that simple bolt of hope. A hope that a reader could simply find in nothing but an honest confession/discovery of a writer attempting to get a better chance in knowing life. I want to be able to touch people's lives with words that could pierce through even the thickest walls of ignorance or even denial. It all starts with communication."

I went through a rather unstable first week of the 2nd semester what with the 4 classes back-to-back 3 days a week annndd the daunting fact that I ended up having the most intimidating professor for Writing102. I'm trying not to dwell on that though. <em>All in the mind.</em><br /><br />On a lighter note, I headed down to the Mall of Emirates with Hafsa and her family this evening, with the school bus. Aha. This time, we boarded the later bus (which supposedly caters to the unisex) that came 10min after the first bus service (females only) to that mall, anddd found ourselves surrounded by hooligans from the Mens' Dorms. Fascinating actually, 'cos apart from the Arabs there were the Korean and Russian students too. Seniors. Haha. Man they were hilarious. Many times Hafsa and I were laughing at the back of the bus.Lol. OH and&nbsp; the trip back to the campus was seriously an adrenaline boost. The loud music, the speeding (+racing with the other bus-.-), the guys making endless noise. Mannn. It was fun tho.

Oh Carter Burwell is a genius. I'm hooked to the Twilight Score. I recall the days when I had that flute in my hands. haha.<br /><br />There's nothing much for me to do this break. Apart from catching up with some reading and assisting dad in his CID work, I have to say that facebook is getting onto me each day. I would know why.<br /><br /><em><strong>Alhamdullillah</strong></em> my overall results for the first semester were more than what I could have prayed for. A GPA of 3.75 is not bad at all *gleaming*.<br />Now for the upcoming semester, I'm contemplating whether or not to drop management and take arabic language course instead. Not that I'm not ever gonna take up arabic. But it's just a matter of time. Then again, it would be a hassle for me to switch sections for my mcm course as the current schedule doesnt permit me taking mcm and arabic at the same time. *deep thought*. Screw that, I'm just gonna stick to management. I'm sure knowing a thing or two about leadership and organizational skills will benefit me in many ways in future.<br /><br />Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh. He is hilarious.</div>"

"event","Something really funny happened today in my writing class. This has to do with the professors here being really spontaneous and witty in their remarks. lol. So today we were supposed to do a&nbsp;QUIZ in PAIRS. Yes, a very odd technique but apparently her aim was for us to negotiate with our ''partner'' on the right answer, and in that way she thinks that it would be more beneficial for us (And I so agree.) Anyway, maybe I haven't told you how fond she is in pairing up the opposite sexes together. So this time, she randomly paired us up using the attendance list and I, was made to work with this arab (no surprise) guy okay. So here's the funny part : After my prof called out our names, she went to look at us both and said ''Oh my, aren't you two lovely!'' LOL. My my. I was like ''Thanks Professor, that's a start''. And no, I did not say that out loud. haha. But lucky for me my working partner was totally cool about it.

"event","Apparently after that traumatic-wating-for-the-cab&nbsp;incident i decided to stay in the dorms during weekends and have an unlimited ''Me time'' of my own. But&nbsp;on Thursday evening&nbsp;just as I was about to take a nap (thank god I didn't), Ms Jenifah called me. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ''Najiha, do you wanna go out with us?''&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''Erm. When's that?''&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ''Errr. in 10 minutes?'' 
And so Khalisa (&nbsp;her eldest daughter) drove us (me, Ms Jenifah &amp; one of her students) to Dubai Festival City where we had supper and watched ''Taken''. Awesome movie on human trafficking. This is the kind of show that makes mums go ''AHAH! This is WHY I worry when you don't call!'' &amp; so&nbsp;on&nbsp;so forth.&nbsp;hawhaw. 

While we were having supper we got into an interesting conversation/gossiping (hehheh) pertaining to guys (generally), the arab culture annnd the students in AUS. It turns out that we can never run away from AUS students cos every minute there will surely be students saying hi to ms Jenifah. hmm i guess at least I felt kinda ''popular'' for&nbsp;the day-.-."

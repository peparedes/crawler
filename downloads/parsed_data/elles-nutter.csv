"event","This just tells you how tough it is to be single nowadays.
This was on the ""Tonight Show"" with Jay Leno. Jay went
into the audience to find the most embarrassing first date
that a woman ever had.
<lj-cut>
The winner described her worst first date experience.
There was absolutely no question as to why her tale
took the prize!

She said it was mid winter... snowing and quite cold... and
the guy had taken her skiing in the mountains outside Salt
Lake City, Utah. It was a day trip (no overnight). They were
strangers, after all, and truly had never met before.

The outing was fun but relatively uneventful until they were
headed home late that afternoon. They were driving back down
the mountain, when she gradually began to realize that she
should not have had that extra latte.

They were an hour away from anywhere with a rest room and
in the middle of nowhere! Her companion suggested she try to
hold it, which she did for a while. Unfortunately, because of the
heavy snow and slow going, there came a point where she told
him that he had better stop and let her pee beside the road,
or it would be the front seat of his car.

They stopped and she quickly went out beside the car, yanked
her pants down and started. In the deep snow she didn't have
good footing, so she let her butt rest against the rear fender to
steady herself. Her companion stood beside of the car watching
for traffic and indeed was a real gentleman and refrained from
peeking.
All she could think about was the relief she felt despite the rather 
embarrassing nature of the situation. Upon finishing however,
she soon became aware of another sensation. As she bent to pull
up her pants, the young lady discovered her buttocks were firmly
glued against the car's fender. Thoughts of tongues frozen to pump 
handles immediately came to mind as she attempted to disengage
her flesh from the icy metal.

It was quickly apparent that she had a brand new problem due
to the extreme cold. Horrified by her plight and yet aware of the
humor of the moment, she answered her date's concerns about
""what is taking so long""with a reply that indeed, she was ""freezing
her butt off and in need of some assistance!""
He came around the car as she tried to cover herself with her
sweater and then, as she looked imploringly into his eyes, he
burst out laughing. She too, got the giggles and when they finally 
managed to compose themselves, they assessed her dilemma. Obviously, as 
hysterical as the situation was, they also were faced
with a real problem. Both agreed it would take something hot to free her 
chilly cheeks from the grip of the icy metal!
Thinking about what had gotten her into the predicament in the
first place, both quickly realized that there was only one way to
get her free. So, ass he looked the other way, her first-time date 
proceeded to unzip his pants and pee her butt off the fender.

As the audience screamed in laughter, she took the Tonight Show
prize hands down... or perhaps that should be ""pants down.""
And you thought your first date was embarrassing.
Jay Leno's comment,
""This gives a whole new meaning to being pissed off. </lj-cut>
and how was YOUR worst date?"

I feel shamed. Then I look into the glass and think
about the workers in the vineyards and all of their hopes

to myself, ""It is better that I drink this wine and let their
dreams come true than be selfish and worry about my liver.""

And saving the best for last, as explained by Cliff Clavin, 
of Cheers. One afternoon at Cheers, Cliff Clavin was explaining the Buffalo Theory to his buddy Norm.
Here's how it went: 

""Well ya see, Norm, it's like this... A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. 
And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. 
In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. 
Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know, kills brain cells. But naturally, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. 
In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. That's why you always feel smarter after a few beers."" 

WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may make you think you are whispering when you are not.</lj-cut>"

"event","Well hello everyone who enjoys reading my livejournal.  It most definitely has been a long time since my last entry.  Yes, I do always seem to say that, but I always remember at the most random of times that I still have this journal.  I used to like writing in this thing so much and then I just suddenly lost interest.  Well, like I said, here I am again, and I hope you all enjoy.

For the rest of you that have read my last couple of entries, you may have noticed a trend.  Even if you haven't noticed it, I will be kind and point it out for you.  I seem to write in this when I have feelings for a girl.  The previous one mentioned Sarah, as did the one before that, and then three ago, Kristen was mentioned.  With that said, I'm sure you can tell where this one is going.  Yes, I do have feelings for a girl this time.  For those of you who don't know, her name is Lauren.  I think the world of her and love being with her.  She is a very special girl that I hope to see even when school lets out.

With that being said, I move on to my next point.  A week from tomorrow (for those of you who can't figure it out I'm talking about April 20th) I will officialy be done with my first year of college.  Scary isn't it?  However, the fact is that I feel very bittersweet over that.  One on hand, I'll be ecstatic that I'm done with school and summer will be here but on the other hand, I'll miss college life and all the wonderful people I've met here.  A good deal of those people have come from the organization that I became a part of during second semester here; RHA.  It would take too long to explain so you'll just have to trust me that it was a worthwhile experience.  Fortunately enough, I will be able to stay in contact with a good deal of those individuals.  Whether that happens though is completely up to the all of us.  So only time will tell what happens.

Anyways, believe it or not, I actually have a sense of pride for the University which I attend.  No, I still don't root for the sports teams here (I will always be a die-hard Spartan no matter how everyone else feels), but I say with pride that I attend The University of Michigan.  Write it down, put it on the front page, do whatever you'd like with it, because I'm sure many of you have never heard me say anything positive about U of M.

Not much else I'd like to say now.  Baseball season started last week and that is something I am very excited about.  Although the Tigers had a bittersweet ending to their season last year I have been anticipating this season even moreso.  Hopefully they can duplicate their success and have another great season.  The Red Wings opened up their series today with a 4-1 win over Calgary, which is a very good thing because I would not like to see them flame out again in the first round (no pun intended).  As for the Pistons, the playoffs start soon so it's almost time to go to work!

Anyways, that's all I can think of for now.  Hope you all enjoyed it.  And although I have nothing more to write, there are certain things, or well people to say it a little better, that I cannot get out of my mind now :).  So until next time..."

"event","Well hello everybody.  Look who - once again - decided it was time to write in this thing again.  Anyways, I come to you live from the University of Michigan located in Ann Arbor.  For those of you who read my previous entries I did happen to choose U of M, though I keep asking myself whether or not it was the right decision.  The answer to that question honestly depends on the day.  Yes, U of M does have its strong points, though to the only one I ever see is the academics prestige, but now I even find myself asking is that even a good reason to be here?  I know for a fact I would be happier in East Lansing.  I would be doing better in school at MSU, but oh well.  I guess we'll see how everything goes because I am definitely not one to quit.

Well since I haven't written since the beginning of July I better talk a little bit more about the school which I attend.  For those of you who actually wonder whether or not Michigan is actually as hard as people make it about to be...it is.  It's ridiculous everything you have to do here.  You feel lucky when you have even an hour of free time.  You're all probably wondering whether or not I have gone over the dark side and become a University of Michigan fan.  And here's the honest answer for that question: no.  Coming here has probably even made me more of a State fan than ever.  Going to a football game where it's basically me rooting against 110,000 obnoxious fans will do that to you.  I have also grown to like The Ohio State University more so as well.  I have an Ohio State t-shirt to prove it for those of you who do not believe me.  To build off of football, our flag football season ended yesterday in the quarterfinals.  Sorry but I will not continue about that topic.  Moving on, I have made a great deal of friends here too and I wouldn't trade that for anything.  

Now, in dealing with the last entry, with ""the girl from orientation"", also known as Sarah, is now my girlfriend.  We've been dating for a short while and she is a very lovely girl :).  Just thought I would include that in there for you that actually wonder.

I also have some very sad news as well...the ""Big Three"" as we were referred to in previous entries are no more.  With me being away at school it has been very difficult as you may see for us to conduct our normal activities.  However, the good news is that none of us has gotten into a significant amount of trouble since the ""incident"" of roughly 16 months ago, something that will not be talked about.

Ah, another thing that has just popped into my mind is the fact that for the first time in my entire life the Detroit Tigers made the playoffs and even advanced to the World Series!!!  Yes, as you could have seen from my various baseball posts and Tiger related things - such as my profile picture here - I was ecstatic.  I was fortunate enough to be able to go to 13 Tigers games this year, including three playoff games.  Let me tell you, I've never been to ANYTHING as exciting as those three playoff games in my entire life.  You probably would have laughed at me had you seen me when I walked into Comerica Park and just looked around.  I was wide-eyed and in complete awe.  I mean, being the HUGE Tigers fan that I am, what could possibly have been better than being at a playoff game - and not just any game, the first ever playoff game in Comerica Park's short history.  Anyways, the three games I was able to go to were Games 3 and 4 against the hated Yankees and Game 4 against Oakland.  Game 4 against may be one of the best moments of my short life.  When Magglio hit that shot to left field I was jumping up and down like a little kid.  I think I either hugged or high-fived everyone remotely around me.  Wouldn't trade that moment for anything.  

Anyways, I think that's about it for now.  Much more has happened and all but there just isn't time to write it all down.  This definitely but me into a better mood too.  Today hadn't been the best day but just remembering events from the past definitely cheered me up.  So until next time..."

"event","Well look who decided to write in his livejournal again.  Never thought I'd hear myself say those words again.  Anyways, much has happened in the past 2 months or so since I last updated, but unfortunately for the few of you out there who read this, a quick recap will have to do.

Well where shall I start...how about the most recent events.  Yesterday was the home opener for my most favorite sports team, the Detroit Tigers.  Our neighbor's dad was able to get three tickets to the game for us so me, my brother, and our neighbor (all shall rename unnamed) left school early and headed downtown for the Tigers game.  They lost and we did not get any batting practice baseballs or any during the game (which was a double negative), but we were at a Tigers game and out of school so we were all happy.  Now, for the first time ever, I have finally attended a DELTACO!!!  We were kind of near the area where the restaurant was and we've never been allowed to go so we decided that this was the perfect opportunity to go.  So I can finally say that I've attended a Del Taco.

Moving on, my mother, brother, and I will all be leaving this Sunday - Easter - for Arizona.  I cannot wait!  Since the day my mom talked about it with my grandparents I've been excited to go.  It'll be my second time ever on a plane and being a place where it's always warm is definitely something I am looking forward to.  Plus, me and my brother will make the entire trip fun so we have no worries.  Plus, we get to go to a Diamondbacks game when they play San Francisco, so we get to see the biggest cheater of all time - drumroll please - Barry Bonds!

Again I'm surprised I'm writing this because I just finished my research paper for school yesterday and let me tell you it was a very grueling process.  Ms. Tucci made it very unorganized without too many guidelines, so we were basically on our own the entire time.  Plus, I've never written a 10 page paper in my life so it was a little worrisome, though I don't believe I did too bad on it.


Now, just to give sort of a speed through of all the other details, the ""Big Three"" as we referred to in past entries have NOT gotten into trouble with the law since the infamous event over the summer.  I know I learned my lesson and will never do something like that again.  Yes, I did choose U of M, and although I loathe and despise the sports teams, I really am looking forward to attending the university.  I do have a girlfriend now, her name is Kristen, we've been going out for a little over a month, and hopefully that is going alright.  

Well I guess that's about it for now.  Yes, it did turn into another long entry where I ramble on about random things but I hope you all have fun reading it.  This is for you too Jess, I hope you enjoy reading this one too :).  So until next time..."

"event","Alright, so yesterday I got to leave school early to go downtown for the NFL Experience and let me tell ya, Detroit is so much better now.  It's amazing.  Just walking around and feeling safe is a huge improvement.  The city's just so much more vibrant and energetic and there's so much more to do and see now down there.  The Winterfest or Winter Blast or whatever it's called has brought a lot of people downtown, which is definetely.  

As for the NFL Experience, well that was awesome.  My brother and I are by far the two best announcers ever.  We got to go in an hour early and there were like NO lines whatsoever.  So we got to go through everything a good few times.  Too bad I'm too busy to go back, because I definitely would.  I guess it's just sinking in how good the Super Bowl coming to Detroit actually is.  It's made the city better.  People friendlier.  And well I'm a hell of a lot prouder to see Detroit like this.  Let's just hope that the actual Super Bowl makes it all the better.

Well that's it for now.  I have school now and have to leave now.  And for those of you who are stupid and missed what this entry was all about...DETROIT KICKS ASS!!!"

"event","For those of you who care out there (and hopefully there are some people that read this...) I am now alright.  I don't know how to explain it, but during school today, something just hit me and I was over Lauren.  Just like that.  Over her.  Yes, it sounds extremely weird and I don't even understand how it happened, but I'm over her.  Yes, it'd still be great to go out with her again because she's a very lovely girl but I'm not going to spend my life sad and unhappy and waiting for her to take me back.  That's not me.  There are BILLIONS of girls out there and I'm quite positive that I'll find the right one sooner or later.  So what's the point of getting sad and everything over one girl you ask?  THERE IS NONE!  If it didn't work out then, well, God has another plan for you.  Obviously he has another plan for me (aka Lauren's not the one), and I'm not going to argue with Him.  

This is for all of you out there who care for me and were worried about me.  I really appreciate all the concern you showed towards me.  I'm glad I have people who look over me.  Plus...I may just like another girl now...

...and this is a late add-on, but the news is...I still think of Lauren a lot.  I'm just like Joe, where certain places, songs, and other things remind me of her.  I looked over some old lj entries of hers and realized how back I fucked up.  I had everything in the world going for me and I took it for granted...nothing I can do now, I can't dwell on things...

Yes, I know this entry makes no sense at all but it's just how I feel.  Sometimes I know I'm completely over her and other times I miss her like crazy.  Man is life confusing..."

"event","Yes, if you're reading this it means that I actually have written in my livejournal for just about the first time in 2 months.  Much has happened though really only two things stand out in my mind.  One being the church retreat I went on and the other being Lauren.  Both of which I will go into detail.

This past Friday-Saturday I went on my fifth church retreat, fourth in the past two years, and fourth as a facilitator.  I have to say that this one was the best.  Just the conversations that we had with Father John were amazing.  This one kid had so much to ask and talk about and he actually knew what he was talking about, which was suprprising.  I became closer to a lot of people and now am much closer with a few people.  Specifically, those people would be Tom S, Travis, and Jimi.  I loved the whole retreat and sadly, it may have been my last one.  Going off to college next year (and yes, I did pick U of M), I just don't know if I'll be able to make it.  Though I sure do hope I'll be able to.

Moving on to Lauren...what can I say about her?  There's so much that I could just say and well I'll just write about whatever happens to come into my head first.  As you all may or may not know, Lauren is my ex-girlfriend and well, let's just say that in my opinion, I wasn't the best boyfriend when we went out.  I realized that way to late, honesly I think the day we broke up and I've never stopped caring for her.  I love her now so much more than I did before and I will do anything to be with her.  She doesn't see any future between us and that kill's me.  I just want to be with her.  Nothing else in the world would make me happier right now.  Lauren I know I screwed up before but I am a changed man, just like I told you.  I'm completely different from before, and you know that I would do anything for you.  Yes, I could just go on and meet another girl and push all this aside but I don't want to.  You're all that I've been thinking of the last few days.  There's nothing else on my mind other than church and God.  All I want to be able to do is to be able to say that you're mine.  To say that yep, that's my girlfriend right there, and I'm the luckiest guy in the world to have her.  But unfortunately, I don't and probably have that.  I won't give up Lauren.  I love you and I don't want to lose you.  You mean the world to me and I hate myself for realizing that so late.  I'M SORRY.  So, if you're reading this Lauren, I want you to know that I love you.  Yeah, I may be only 17 and I don't know what love feels like yet, but if I had to give a definition for love, my feeling right now is how I would describe it.  I LOVE YOU and hope you reconsider and give me one more chance...

Well, it's time for school now though I don't know what good it'll do me.  I won't be able to concentrate on anything today, my mind will be on only one person..."

"event","Yes people, as a matter of fact I am not dead.  I am alive and supposedly well but who knows nowadays.  It'll be I think about 8 weeks tomorrow since my last entry.  Oh it has been very busy don't get me wrong, it's just that I've been busy/sick/grounded and many other things that come with being a kid.  Well now that that's been said, let's get into the main details of the past 2 months.

Well being grounded was quiet some time...no, it definitely wasn't.  Well it all started because the cops came to my neighbors house for something that three of us did.  The man who called the cops on us wasn't too happy so there were big talks between my parents, neighbors parents, and the three of us.  So all we could do for three weeks was go to each other's houses, have people over to our house and watch TV.  That's it.  Everything else was taken away from us.  Well I'm not going to tell you all what we did so I'm going to let all of your minds run wild.  And no, I'm not a bad kid.  Oh and the man made us do community service once a week for like 12 weeks.  Luckily, they were extremely nice and let us off after like only 4-5 weeks.  We were all so happy. 

Let's see where should I go now...well I missed the entire second week of school and then the first day of the next week because I was sick.  It all started at MSU's opening football game (Saturday).  We took my temp the next day and it was 103.  It got up to 104 on Monday and then gradually went down until it went away Thursday night.  Unfortunately, from the blood that my doctor took from me on Wednesday and Thursday, they all decided that I needed to go to the hospital.  So Friday afternoon me and mom left for R.O. Beaumont.  I was quarantined to my room for 3 whole days (I didn't get out until Monday) which was torture.  I hate not being able to move around and do things.  Well they think I'm alright now so everything's good. 

Speaking of Michigan State, they definitely have a sweet team this year.  That definitely NOT something the University of Michigan can say.  State's started off the year 4-0 and Michigan's a ho-hum 2-2.  Those records are going to change to 5-0 and 2-3 respectively this Saturday when Michigan and Michigan State will be playing up in East Lansing.  Oh and guess what?  I'LL BE AT THE GAME.  Yep, that's right, I will be at Spartan Stadium when U of M drops below .500 and State improves to 5-0. :)

Well last weekend we got to go to Chicago and let me tell you that was sweet.  We got to go to the Cubs game on Saturday which went going to WRIGLEY FIELD.  What made it even better was being able to see the St. Louis Cardinals too.  Michael almost got a ball during batting practice, which made it even better.  Unfortunately, we left the game during the top of the 8th so we could go and see Michigan State play Notre Dame.  We went to a bar in Downtown Chicago and that was amazing.  Just the atmosphere around the football game was great and it was even better when State BEAT Notre Dame AT Notre Dame.  Something Michigan couldn't even do at the Big House.  On the way to the bar I took like the sweetest picture ever.  We were stopped right on Michigan Avenue directly below the John Hancock Tower.  So all I had to do was look up and that was it.  The best picture ever of the Hancock Tower.  SO, IF YOU KNOW HOW TO POST A PICTURE IN HERE COULD YOU TELL ME PLEASE BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO PUT UP THIS PICTURE?!!?  Our hotel was awesome.  It was right on the river and we saw EVERYTHING!  The top floor of the hotel was even better.  It was all glass and me and my brother just looked out in awe.  Even though we've seen Chicago so many times, it just never gets old.  It's definitely my favorite city.  And if you think B-Ham's fun, you haven't seen NOTHING.  Walking around Downtown Chicago at night was amazing.  I love walking around the downtown's of big cities.

For all of you who do care, I do have a girlfriend at the moment too.  Her name is Lauren.  I think that's enough information given.  I'd rather not say anymore ;)

Well those were the main parts of the past few months for me.  School's back which has it's up and down's but I'm back to work again, and getting money is always good.  Hope you don't mind such a long entry.  I hope you all ACTUALLY READ IT.  So until next time..."

"event","<P>Well I'm sorry, but here I am once again apologizing for not updating for the past month or so you could say.&nbsp; It has been a very eventful last month and unfortunately I can't really remember most of what happened.&nbsp; Well here goes nothing and I'll give it a shot.</P>
<P>Well first I'll start with the most recent details.&nbsp; This past weekend we went up north to the ever so popular Canadian Lakes.&nbsp; The place where about a year ago was given the ""best week ever"" tag for many certain details which will be quickly recapped:&nbsp; the meeting of two of our ""best friends"" Scobby and F.A., meeting one of real best friends right now Brooke, and then many other things.&nbsp; This weekend was great and&nbsp;all but unfortunately could not match last years trip.&nbsp; One of the main reasons was that our good friend Joseph was&nbsp;unable to&nbsp;come due to&nbsp;his&nbsp;father taking him to MIS and the Buick Open.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it was still a good time.&nbsp; Brooke was up there and I did get to see the ""tape"" that was filmed and which I was&nbsp;very looking forward too.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh and&nbsp;in my&nbsp;opinion one of the best things was getting tan.&nbsp; I hate going out&nbsp;being pale because I don't feel as confident because I kind of rag on people&nbsp;who are extremely pale.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Well and for all of you who really know me, you know that I love, I mean absolutely love baseball.&nbsp; Unfortunately for me, our baseball season ended just over a week ago.&nbsp; I was sad and happy at the same time however, because our team was so bad.&nbsp; But I did have an extremely good play in my opinion.&nbsp; Well they had runners on second and third and two outs and the batter hit a grounder up the middle (I'm playing centerfield).&nbsp; Well I charged the ball as fast as I&nbsp;could and fielded the ball cleanly like 20 feet beyond the infield dirt.&nbsp; When I got the ball I looked up, hesitated like a half a second and then&nbsp;threw the ball towards home plate with all my mite.&nbsp; Well the ball traveled like it was on a rope right to the catchers mitt which was about a foot above the ground, right in front of the plate.&nbsp; A perfect throw.&nbsp; It never had to bounce.&nbsp; He didn't even need to move his mitt, it was in perfect position.&nbsp; So I was pumped because that ended the inning but nothing much went right for me after that.</P>
<P>Speaking of baseball, Joe, Nick, my brother and I went to a Detroit Tigers game.&nbsp; Well we're all obsessed with getting baseballs at the game so we got their at like 5:30 (and hour and a half before the game started) so we could catch batting practice.&nbsp; Well we walk down and Joe gets a ball just laying on the grounded.&nbsp; Well to make a long story short by the end of batting practice we had 10 baseballs.&nbsp; Michael got four, Joe three, Nick two, and me one.&nbsp; Still, it was sweet getting that many.</P>
<P>Well, onto the ever so popular subject of girls.&nbsp; Well I think I finally do have a girl right now that actually cares about me.&nbsp; I'm sorry though, I will not go into details so you will have to ask me if you have any questions.</P>
<P>Well speaking of girls, I can't belive I'm actually saying this (you may all want to right this down) but I actually like the show Laguna Beach.&nbsp; Yep, that's right, I'll repeat it I like Laguna Beach.&nbsp; Well my birthday is on August 21st and again I can't believe this, but I think I might ask for season one for my birthday.&nbsp; Lauren, for those of you that do watch the show, is like the hottest girl alive out their.&nbsp; She's gorgoeus and well I'll stop now because no one wants to hear me ramble on about girls lol.  However, there is one quick thing that I would like to add.  Don't get me wrong, I love where I live, but I can't say I wouldn't like to move to another city and just see what it would be like to live somewhere else.  Cities like New York, Chicago, and anywhere in Southern California would be a great place to live.  Just a thought though...</P>
<P>Oh and now on the subject of doing things I can't believe I've actually done, I created a myspace.&nbsp; Yep that's right,&nbsp;I, Matt Grimaldi, created a myspace.The link to it is on the top of my livejournal page if you have one and would like to add me.</P>
<P><B>Oh and I almost forgot.  A few weeks ago, myself and the other ""usual three"" were outside playing baseball in the street in front of my house.  It was hot and we were definitely bored so someone came up with the brilliant idea to throw a ball at the next moving vehicle that was to pass us by.  Me, being the stupid one at the moment, decided what the hell?  It's nothing big anyways.  Boy was I wrong.  As soon as the ball hit the car she put on the brakes and backed up.  We thought nothing of it.  Then she asks ""WHO THREW IT?"" in a very snotty tone.  Of course we weren't just going to be all happy and say, ""OH!  It was him.  We're sorry"" because that just wouldnt't be us.  So we all got up after like 3 minutes of nothing happening and ran.  She talked to the neighbor and being the compelete jackass he is, told her where we lived.  She drove by a few times a few minutes later in a different car, thinking we wouldn't notice her.  So after 10 minutes of sitting outside, we all decide to go inside and watch some TV.  Suddenly the door bell rings and to our surprise, a memeber of the Troy Police is standing in the doorway.  To make everything short, the lady called the cops and said we meant to damage her car.  Alright, maybe she's just plain dumb, but tennis balls cannot cause damage to a car when lightly tossed.  So the cop made us apologize to her.  Luckily, we didn't get in trouble and the parents didn't find out which was definitely a good thing.</B></P>
<P>Well I guess that's it for now.&nbsp; I apologize for writing so much, but after about a month of not updating, you do have a lot to write about.&nbsp; Well I hope you enjoy so until next time...</P>"

<P>Well I would&nbsp;have to say that it did have the best start to ANY summer of all time.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only because we were able to travel to New York and Boston!&nbsp; It was definitely the best vacation I've ever been on before.&nbsp; Boston was&nbsp;just a great city.&nbsp; Going up the very tall building right in the middle of downtown&nbsp;(I think&nbsp;it's name was Prudential?) we got one of the best views&nbsp;from the top of&nbsp;a building ever.&nbsp; It was just amazing to see the rows and rows of houses, the parks, the rest of downtown, and what I thought was the best<STRONG>, FENWAY PARK</STRONG>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all you baseball fans out there, you can't say you've been to a baseball game until you go to Fenway Park.&nbsp; It is by FAR the best ballpark in all of baseball.&nbsp; We were even allowed to go onto the field for a special Father's&nbsp;Day&nbsp;gathering.&nbsp; Even with how good Boston was, it didn't even compare to New York City.&nbsp; NYC&nbsp;is/was BY FAR, the best place on earth.&nbsp; Me,&nbsp;being a skyscraper freak, was in heaven.&nbsp; You couldn't walk anywhere in Manhattan without being&nbsp;within a few blocks of a buidling at least&nbsp;500 feet tall.&nbsp; If you ever go to New York, you have to go to The Empire State Building.&nbsp; The view&nbsp;from up there was absolutely breathtaking.&nbsp; It was amazing.&nbsp; You could see all of New York&nbsp;and everything else around the city.&nbsp; I would&nbsp;love to explain everything we did, but&nbsp;that would take up too much space and I'm sure none of you would&nbsp;like to read it.&nbsp; But, I do have to&nbsp;say one more thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, it wasn't as good as Fenway Park, Yankee Stadium was one of the best ballparks out there.&nbsp; Just the atmosphere around it and how much the city cares for baseball.</P>
<P>Honestly, other than that I haven't done much of anything.&nbsp; I've been working a lot and I guess that's alright because I'm making money, but after awhile, it&nbsp;just kind&nbsp;of gets old.&nbsp; I have hung out with Lauren and Sam and hanging out with both of them was great.&nbsp; Hanging out&nbsp;with&nbsp;people in general is great because my so-called ""friends"" at Athens never call me to do anything and honestly it doesn't bother me.&nbsp; I'm just so different from most of them anyways,&nbsp;so I don't&nbsp;mind whatsoever hanging out with other people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>That's where my best friend (Joe) comes in.&nbsp; Well since his grades&nbsp;aren't exaclty the best, he's been grounded by his parents for every Monday and Tuesday for the rest of the&nbsp;summer.&nbsp; With all the working I've had to do and considering he's grounded and we were&nbsp;on vacation for a week, we haven't been able to hang out much.&nbsp; Considering we hang out a lot and when we're all here, we're doing something random and that's what make it fun.&nbsp; We just start to do whatever pops into our heads and we still have a good time.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now to better news.&nbsp; I'm sorry, but for those of you that don't know what I look like within&nbsp;two months or so, you may actually be able to see what I look like.&nbsp; My birthday is in just under two months and for some strange reason, I've been wanting a digital&nbsp;camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be just great to&nbsp;just go places and take random pictures of whatever I wanted to and not have to worry about film or anything.&nbsp; I can delete them when&nbsp;I want, and take them whenever I want.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Other than that I don't have much to say.&nbsp; Sorry about the entry being so long, it's just that I had&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;to write about and&nbsp;the&nbsp;right time to write just hadn't come along.&nbsp; To recap what I said too, the summer&nbsp;has a whole has been a dissapointment but there have been some few select times and people that have made it a little bit better.&nbsp; So I guess until next time...&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>"

"event","<P>Well once again I find myself apologizing for not writing enough in here.&nbsp; I try to, but lately I've been extremely busy and really there hasn't been all that much to write about.&nbsp; But anyways, I'll give it a shot and this will most likely end up being one of my longest entries yet.</P>
<P>Well first we must refer to the title of this entry.&nbsp; Yes, so many things have ended for me recently.&nbsp; The biggest thing that ended was my club soccer career.&nbsp; Our last game was Saturday in Kalamazoo and I am not going to try out for a new team this summer.&nbsp; I've had it with soccer and don't even know if I want to try out for varsity this upcoming year.&nbsp; I've just become burnt out.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong I love playing in games and all, I just hate practicing all the time, running, and traveling to places extremely far away for games.&nbsp; It's just as fun as it used to be.&nbsp; The second thing is that the seniors have now left Athens.&nbsp; There are many that I've become great friends with or already are friends with that I will extremely miss.&nbsp; The main ones that I've known forever are Mike Bral and Danny Kelly.&nbsp; I've known them forever and it'll be weird with them gone.&nbsp; The person that I just became friends with and will probably miss the most is Jessa.&nbsp; She's such a great person and extremely good looking and I'll miss not being able to see her in math class now.</P>
<P>Moving on to other things now, there actually is a beginning in all of this.&nbsp; TBB baseball season has FINALLY started.&nbsp; I love baseball and have been looking forward to playing for such a long time.&nbsp; Sure, my team is NOT all that great but that doesn't matter.&nbsp; As long as I'm having a good time then I don't care.&nbsp; School also ends on Friday and then is also a much anticipated thing.&nbsp; Today is and was our last full day of school and it couldn't of come soon enough.&nbsp; With each passing day, June 17th (I think) becomes closer and closer and that's when my vacation to New York, Boston, and Cooperstown starts.&nbsp; I've been wanting to go to New York ever since I can rememeber and this will no doubt be one of the best vacations ever, if not the best.</P>
<P>Speaking of summer, and now again getting on to the subject of girls, summer, and the month of July means that I will get to see Brooke again.&nbsp; It's been since like February since the last time I've seen her and it's just killing me.&nbsp; So that is definitely something I am looking forward to as well.&nbsp; Girl wise, nothing is new with them (aka I've had no further luck) so there's no need to get in to details their.</P>
<P>Oh and this is something that seriously really bothers me.&nbsp; I love all Detroit sports teams, don't get me wrong.&nbsp; But for some reason, I just seem to like the Pistons a little less then everyone else.&nbsp; This is because EVERYONE in our whole school jumped on the bandwagon when the Pistons started to win.&nbsp; None of them are true Pistons fans.&nbsp; I'm sure that if they went back to being an average team all those people wouldn't care one bit about them.&nbsp; Oh well, I'm a true fan, always will be, and there's nothing I can do about anyone elses opinion.  This is for all you people who are REALLY misunderstanding this: I LOVE THE DETROIT PISTONS!!!</P>
<P>Now, I've seen this in a few other people's journal's and I just felt like adding it to mine.&nbsp; Otherwise, have an extremely fantastic day and enjoy school off.</P>

<P>1) Reply with your name and I will write something I like about you.  2) I will then tell what song reminds me of you.  3) If I were to apply a time to you, I'll tell you what it would be.  4) I will try to name a single word that best describes you.  5) I'll tell you the most memorable moment I've had with you.  6) I will tell you what color you remind me of.  7) I'll then tell you something that I've always wondered about you.  8) Put this in your journal.</P>"

"event","<P>Well look at that.&nbsp; It's been just a little over two weeks since my last update and I'm updating again.&nbsp; Yes, I am as shocked as all of you are.&nbsp; But anyways, let's get into the actualt entry now.</P>
<P>It has been a very eventful past few weeks.&nbsp; I will start by talking about our trip to Birmingham last Friday, and what a story it is.&nbsp; It was Friday, and like almost every other Friday, we decided to make our weekly trip to Birmingham.&nbsp; In Birmingham, they have number showing what we thought was how much time you had to cross the street.&nbsp; So being the good citizens that we are, we ran across the street because the numbers were very close to zero.&nbsp; On our way across, this car was turning and was NOT stopping for us.&nbsp; I'm thinking&nbsp;""what are you doing?"" so I stick my hand out as to signal ""don't run us over!!""&nbsp; Well a cop saw that and was not to happy with us.&nbsp; He called us all over and asked for our ID's because appearntly I opened my mouth and was not so nice to him.&nbsp; He spent like at least 10 minutes just sitting in the car doing who know's what, but he didn't find ANYTHING because we're all clean.&nbsp; Oh but what a night it is.</P>
<P>Nick is back now for good too.&nbsp; It's good to have him back again.&nbsp; But it is so unfair that he has all of May, June, July , and August off.&nbsp; But we only have four weeks of school left ourselves so it's not all that bad.&nbsp; Speaking of school, this may be the first time in a while that I can remember being a little bit afraid for my grades.&nbsp; Right now I have a B in my architecture class becuase my teaches grades extremely hard and isn't the fairest grader ever either.&nbsp; The other class is computer science.&nbsp; I just flat out don't get the class.&nbsp; I havea very, very high A in the class, but I'm just afraid for the final because I don't want the final to ruin my grade and with it my 4-point.&nbsp; But I have the ut-most confidence that I will be able to pull of ""A's"" in both classes.</P>
<P>Back to the weekly discussions on girls and schools.&nbsp; Girl wise I don't think I like anyone in particular for the first time in a while.&nbsp; The one girl I liked, I was unable to find her screenname or even talk to her at all becuase I never see her so that kind of ended before it even started.&nbsp; Then the other girl, who is actually at my school, surprise, surprise, doesn't like me (no surprise there).&nbsp; Well I'm not positive that she doesn't like me but&nbsp;I&nbsp;got that impression because it&nbsp;seemed like she wasn't too fond of talking to me online, so I was like whatever.&nbsp; So I really don't like anyone now, and it sucks but it's okay because summer is coming and summer is going to be&nbsp;awesome this year, plus college&nbsp;is coming up.</P>
<P>College wise, no&nbsp;further progress on where I would like to go.&nbsp; I talked to a friend at work and he said that MSU's engineering program was top notch so again I&nbsp;find myself leaning for the good old green and white.&nbsp; The&nbsp;maize and blue are still a very good possibility though&nbsp;too.&nbsp; It's too hard to decide now.&nbsp; Staying on schools, I took the SAT last weekend too.&nbsp; It wasn't that bad, but&nbsp;I am pretty positive that I did better on the ACT.&nbsp; I have never done particularly good on the SAT so I wasn't getting my hopes&nbsp; up.&nbsp; However, I wouldn't be surprised if I did pretty good on it either.&nbsp; Only one complaint and that's that it's way too&nbsp; long.&nbsp; There were like 10 or 11 different&nbsp;sections&nbsp;plus the essay along with only like 11 minutes of break time.&nbsp; Not what I&nbsp;would call fun.</P>
<P>&nbsp;I also was able to attend Game 5 of the Pistons-Sixers and that was big fun.&nbsp; They won the game and as many of you know are now playing the Pacers of Indiana.&nbsp; I am now also surprised to be saying that if my brother and Nick attend the conference finals I may now be wanting to attend with them.&nbsp; I mean it's the conference finals.&nbsp; It's not like it's going to happen for any other sports team in Detroit.&nbsp; It would the Red Wings, but they're dead, the Tigers, well I can wish but&nbsp; I'm not keeping my hopes up or anything, and then the Lions.&nbsp; Need I say anything at all about the Lions?&nbsp; They've never one a Super Bowl, have won about I think ONE measly playoff game in the past 50 years, and now are just terrible.&nbsp; I would much rather see the Tigers win the World Series than any other team in Detroit.</P>
<P>Well I guess that's it for now.&nbsp; If I think of anything else to write about, I will definitely add it to this entry.&nbsp; I apologize for the length of this one, but I just had a lot to write about this time.&nbsp; So anyways, until next time...</P>"

"event","<P>Well I suppose that this entry is a little soone than the last one.&nbsp; I guess three weeks is a little sooner than four weeks, but what's the difference, you're all probably going to tell me to update more aren't you?</P>
<P>Anyways, what happened to the nice weather we were having?&nbsp; I can remember snow, freezing rain, and everything possible happening in the last few days.&nbsp; Yes you did hear me right, it did snow this past weekend.&nbsp; Then, Tuesday night my soccer team had a game.&nbsp; It was one of the worst games ever to play in.&nbsp; It rained basically the whole game, it was freezing, and by the end of the game, I could not feel any part of my body...</P>
<P>Well something else important happened over the last week or so.&nbsp; I got my ACT score back!!&nbsp; It's not too bad I guess but it wasn't what I really was aiming to get.&nbsp; I know people will tell me it's really good, but it's just too low for what I wanted to get.&nbsp; I wanted to something higher so that all the colleges in Michigan would most definitely let me in, with my score being so high.&nbsp; Oh well, I retake it in June so there's always that test to try and improve my score.&nbsp; Staying on the subject of colleges, after all the bashing of Michigan and saying that I would never go their, I am actually considering going there more so than before.&nbsp; My good friend Nick came&nbsp;home from U of M because they're done for school, and within like a day or so he had TWO jobs.&nbsp; That made me think, if he's only been at Michigan for a year, and he's gotten jobs that quickly, imagine how&nbsp;easy it would be with a degree.&nbsp; The only thing&nbsp;holding my back is how tough U&nbsp;of M's engineering program is.&nbsp; I don't know if I want to be that stressed out all the time.&nbsp; College is supposed to be fun too.</P>
<P>Now to add a little&nbsp;humor to my entry now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday was my&nbsp;brother Mike's birthday&nbsp;so he got to choose where we were to go out to eat.&nbsp; Of course, he choose Mongolian Barbecue in Royal Oak because it's his favorite restaurant and it's in Royal Oak (hey I wasn't complaining).&nbsp; Anyways, halfway through our meal, our waitress brought back a pop for my dad and spilled&nbsp;it all over the table and my brother.&nbsp; I just kind of sat their and looked at my brother, thinking how is he going to react?&nbsp; He&nbsp;took it well.&nbsp; Didn't get&nbsp;mad or anything at all.&nbsp; I know I wouldn't have&nbsp;been happy had someone spilled Coke over me, ecspecially if it were my birthday.</P>
<P>The situation with girls&nbsp;has not gotten any better either.&nbsp; I decided yesterday after talking to Lauren that they are absolutely, 100%&nbsp;IMPOSSIBLE to understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;What&nbsp;I do never seems to please a girl, and what might work for one girl, doesn't for another.&nbsp; I mean why can't you all just appreciate&nbsp;that we're just trying to do something nice for you?!?!&nbsp; Oh well,&nbsp;I know I'll never understand them, but maybe&nbsp;I'll get a&nbsp;better understand or you guys will just be a little more appreciative.&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't go any farther&nbsp;into details about girls or anyone in particular unless you comment and ask...</P>

However, I must add that there are two extremely good looking girls at my work and I hear that both are without boyfriends so maybe I'll try my luck with them.  It couldn't hurt at all.
<P>Oh and this is for you Katy, baseball is better!!!</P>
<P>I guess that's it for now.&nbsp; Nothing else really interesting to put&nbsp;in here and I'm sure nothing else I put in here you guys would actually like to read so&nbsp;I'll just leave it at that.&nbsp; Until&nbsp;next time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>"

"event","<P>Well once again I would like to apologize for the long gap inbetween two entries.&nbsp; This has just about had to be the longest time ever, and I apologize to all of you who actually like to read my journal.</P>
<P>First of all, I would like to say that finally the weather is nice here!!!&nbsp; It's awesome to be able to go outside and just hang out rather than just sitting inside doing nothing or whatever.&nbsp; I have been playing a lot of basketball with Joe and Mike lately and it's actually fun!&nbsp; Everything else is just much more enjoyable as well because you're&nbsp;not worrying about being cold.</P>
<P>I definitely had to work a lot over break, but it was worth it because I'm poor and could definitely use the extra money.&nbsp; The one bad thing was that I had to work on Easter, but I did get paid extra for that so in the end, it wasn't all that bad afterall.&nbsp; Work isn't actaully all that bad now, considering I finally know what I'm doing and know the people that I work with.</P>
<P>Well this was a very eventful Spring Break.&nbsp; I got to hang out with all sorts of people.&nbsp; Finally got to hang out with one girl&nbsp;that I thought I like but she most definitely screwed things up - I will not go into details or mention names, so if you would like to&nbsp;know more you are going to have to ask about it in your comment - but was else is new, nothing with girls ever seems to work for me.&nbsp; <STRONG>BUT,</STRONG> right now things aren't looking all that bad for me.&nbsp; I will go more into details later on in the entry.</P>
<P>In my opinion I saw one of the best movies of all time too over break.&nbsp; It goes by the name of (drumroll please) <STRONG>EUROTRIP!!!</STRONG>&nbsp; It's such a good movie, and the main song to the movie is one of the best song's of all time.&nbsp; Scotty doesn't know!!!&nbsp; Only a few people would actually know what I'm talking about by saying that.</P>
<P>Went to the D on Friday and wow is it ever a bad city.&nbsp; There is so much construction being done EVERYWHERE because the city is trying to boost it's image for the Baseball All-Star Game and the Super Bowl, but come on, it is Detroit.&nbsp; Chicago, again, and once and for all, is still by far the&nbsp;best city on the face of the Earth.&nbsp; But going to Detroit was a lot of fun.&nbsp; We got to go up to the 39th floor of the Ren Cen&nbsp;by this actually good looking lady and got to see north.&nbsp; But the stupid towers around the Ren Cen wouldn't let us see anymore.&nbsp; Next we went to the Penob... yeah,&nbsp;the weird looking building with the weird name.&nbsp; We got up to like the 40th floor, and again got to see north, but this time it was awesome because there were no buildings anywere near us, so we got to see for what seemed like forever.&nbsp; We went to&nbsp;Greektown after (opa!) and the guy at the restaurant made the mistake of giving us crayons, we made a mess, but didn't intend too.&nbsp; Oh, but the fun for Friday wasn't finished yet.&nbsp; We made like our weekly trip to Birmingham because it is one of the best cities around here to hang out (correct that, THE&nbsp;BEST) and (continued from abaove) we meet these lovely ladies&nbsp;and one of them and me have turned out to be very good friends, her name is Emilie :) .&nbsp; I'm happy and we're going to hang out some more soon&nbsp;and no doubt it's going to be&nbsp;fun.</P>
<P><STRONG>IMPORTANT QUESTION: </STRONG>I have been thinking and am wondering if I should keep my journal friends only, or should I make all of them open to the public, so everyone can read it?&nbsp; I will go by what everyone says the most in their comments.&nbsp; But at this one will at least be public.</P>
<P>Much,&nbsp; much more happened, but there is way too much to type and I'm sure no one is going to want to read it all, because I&nbsp;wrote enough as it is here.&nbsp; So off to school now, you all have a good day&nbsp;now.&nbsp; </P>"

"event","<P>Well don't you just love it when your friends invite you to do something?&nbsp; Well I would too...if they ever did.&nbsp; They don't, so I spend a lot of my time hanging out with Joe and Mike (though hanging out with them is always fun, don't get me wrong).&nbsp; Well on our half day on Thursday, me, Mike, and Joe all went to Royal Oak and Birmingham.&nbsp; It was great going up to The ROM and tricking the old people into letting us in.&nbsp; We climbed like 11 flights of stairs, bit it was all worth it because we had this sweet view of Detroit.&nbsp; It was awesome.&nbsp; No trains came by this time though, and that we did not like.&nbsp; Next we went to Birmingham and went to a very famous and&nbsp;one our most favorite buildings, 555 Old Woodward.&nbsp; For once the door on the parking garage was open, so we got to go to the 15th floor and we had another great view of what was to the west.&nbsp; The best times are <STRONG>always </STRONG>with friends...always remember that.&nbsp; I can't wait until I am able to go to U of M to visit my very good friend Nick too, because we do not get to see him much anymore, and it'd be cool to hang out again.&nbsp; The day after Thanksgiving is going to be a lot of fun.</P>
<P>I also got to talk a lot to a friend I met over the summer but haven't been able to talk to a lot.&nbsp; It was awesome talking to her and getting to know her better.&nbsp; I <STRONG>CANNOT</STRONG> wait to go up north again.&nbsp; Since we're on the subject of girls...I give up on them, at least the ones at my school and the other local schools (except for&nbsp;one particular one).&nbsp; Things never work out with them, so I dont know anymore.&nbsp; I can't wait until college so I can start over new and meet new people and for something good to actually turn out with that person.</P>
<P>Oh and all of you University of Michigan fans&nbsp;better be thanking your good old friends to the north now (<STRONG>Michigan State University</STRONG>) for kicking the crap out of the #4 ranked team in all the land (the Wisconsin Badgers) and basically handing you guys a trip to Pasadena now.&nbsp; That should be us though.&nbsp; We should be going to the Rose Bowl...if Stanton does not get hurt then we beat Michigan, Ohio State, and Rutgers, putting us at 8-2 overall and 6-1 in the Big Ten and smelling roses.  While we're on the subject of college, I'm still up in the air to where I am going to go, even though I haven't applied yet.  I have the grades for Michigan, but it'd just be tough to go there after all these years of being such a huge Michigan State fan.  It'd also be tough to pass on U of M for MSU because of how good a school Michigan is.</P>
<P>Oh and here is a notice for everyone:&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>If you are not on my friends list, this will be the last entry that you will be able to read, so if you want to continue to read my journal, you must comment and add me to your list (see my bio for more info).</STRONG></P>

Oh and for all you people out there who said I should keep my journal and continue to write in it here is your chance to really tell me if I should keep it.  And let's beat the 50 comments Nick had in his latest entry!!!"

"event","Well it has been a very busy week.  Full of school, family, sports, and other stuff.

On Sunday we went out to eat with family and they came over for my birhtday.  I went to Royal Oak at night with Mike, Nick, and Joe because it was the last night we could do anything before school.

Monday I had to wake up early to go to the orthodontist.  After that I went with my mom to the Secretary of State so that I could finally get my lisence.  I still haven't driven alone.  O and we were supposed to play our first soccer game...but it got cancelled.

Tuesday...school started...enough said.

Wednesday, first full day of school and our first soccer game.  We won 3-0, and so did varsity even tho their game got called after 1 half because of lightning.  

Thursday...second full day of school and watched Varsity football's first game...wow, shouldn't have wasted my money on it...they lost 9-6, even tho they were favored to win....

Oh and one last thing...this will be the last entry that I will allow everyone to see.  Meaning, if you want to continue to read my journal you will have to add me and then I will add you back.

That's it, it's early and I have to go to school now..."

"event","Well yesterday was a fun day.  First I got up and ran my 2.5 miles...not very fun.  Then we went to the neighbors to go to their friends house...they weren't even up so we left a little later than wanted.  The house was cool...on a lake with a pool and hot tub.  I beat my neighbor Nick in chess and we got to go tubing on the lake with Ed and Joe...we didn't go very fast so we had to ump out of the tube to fall out.

Joe and Nick then decided to come to the Tigers game with us...it was a grand time...they won 3-2 and Nick got a ball in the bottom of the 8th so he thought it was well worth it...I did too...I love the Tigers and they won...

Anways...see ya later..."

"event","Well I'm finally back to using livejournal...and boy did I have a fun weekend.  We lost our playoff baseball game on Friday...but o well...it was a fun season.

Saturday I drove up north with my aunt and we got their at about noon.  My mom, brother, and Joe were already up there.  We spent most of the day by the beach going tubing and just hanging out.  Me n Joe watched Texas Chainsaw Massacre and we were all paranoid the rest of the night.  We all decided we have to see Harold and whatever go to White Castle...looks stupid but we just wanna see it.  Played some basketball...Me, my bro, n Joe...n we kicked some ass.

Sunday...what a great day...Got up at about 10:30 and just hung out until we were finally up.  Went down to the beach at noon and didn't feel like water skiing so I just layed out n started getting an unwanted extreme sunburn on my chest.  The rest of the day was awesome.  Went back down to the beach and went tubing...hit a wave and flew like 10 feet in the air...just before that I skidded across the lake and lost my bathing suit...I told everyone on the boat that I lost it and they were like what??...so I had to show them...lol...wont forget that.  When we were done tubing...me, my bro, n Joe waited on the boat for the very hot neighbor but she didn't came back for a while...we were very sad...so we went on this extremely boring boat ride...when we came back we finally met our lovely neighbor who's name was Brooke...very cool person...we played some volleyball, and went to the beach to play volleyball there but they're were a bunch of drunks playing...and that was where our adventure with the fat hawaiian guy ""Scooby"" and the fat guy aka FA...and then F.A. aka fat ass ruined Slow Motion by Juvenile and also our very most favorite song by Survivor, the Glen Roy Commercial...we were all leaving...then Brooke had to leave and we were all sad, ecspecially me...I didnt want her to leave.  We went back to the beach after dinner and saw our friends again...they yelled at us while we were throwing rocks...when they left me, mike, n joe yelled FAT ASS and they got pissed and before they left they stopped so we could see them and yelled some more...we said something because we just weren't going to take it and they came after us...we ran thru the water back home and they drove over the neighbors lawn...we were like oooooo shit...then like 5 minites later they came back and threatened to kill us...so that ended a very fun and eventful day...

On the way back I helped Joe beat Vice City and now my Vice City is left...I'm at 99% and need only one thing to go...

...Up north was a hell of a good time and I can't wait to go back..."

"event","Well the title basically explains itself.  Today was a very boring day.  I woke up at 8 to run my daily 2.5 miles...I did it in a much faster time than I did so far.  Finally at about 12 I finally left my house...and it was only for my nieghbors...We couldn't swim there today because they have pink algea and have to clean out the pool.  I had to ump another game today but it wasn't bad at all...it was only an hour and a half long...I also saw Alex up there.

Well last night was yet anotherr night of heartbreak.  It was the second game in as many days that we had lost after having a lead going into the bottom of the 7th (8-4; lost 9-8 Monday & 9-8; lost 10-9 yesterday).  It's horrible knowing your so close to that win and you end up losing.

Now, who know's what I am going to do right now...no one's on and no one's home so I guess I'm on my own...talk to you later..."

"event","Well today was a very fun day...up until about 8:30.  That's because my team had an 8-4 lead going into the bottom half of the last inning....and we lost...9-8.  I was 2 for 2 and got on base all four times tho.

Well today I started the day, running with Muneio.  He's a lot faster and I had to catch up to him most of the run.  After that we went to his grandma's to pick up some of the stuff he left at up north.  When we left we went to Zelda's to pick him up so we could all go to Somerset.  There was really no one there and everything was overpriced so it was kinda boring.  We went back to Sean's after and tried his mom's homemade frozen yogurt...not bad at all.  I kicked ass at some XBox baseball and Tony Hawk 4.

Next, I had my baseball game...and well you know the rest....  Now i dont know what I'm gonna do...so I will talk to u all later..."

"event","Well today ended up being a good day after all.  Started out kind of slow but ended up being fun.  That's probably because I didn't do anything until about 1 o clock when i finally went outside.  We went on like our daily walk to 7-11, White Castle, Starbucks, and Farmer Jacks.  The walk home was the best...enough said.  Then we couldn't go swimming and that wasn't fun.  

I had to ump again today and the other coach yelled at me...but I just ignored him...his team lost.   Umping is always fun tho, because you get to see the little kids play baseball.

Came home and almost decided not to go to Birmingham, and if I hadn't of gone I would have missed out on a lot.  We basically just walked around, but that was fun.  We got followed by these 2 lovely ladies, and our neighbor claimed they were following him.  We then walked away, seeing if they were following us and all of a sudden he ended up talking to them and we couldn't believe it.  Found out those two lovely ladies names were Jen and Sierra.  We then talked to other random girls and tripped purpously in front of people.  What a night...well any ways talk to you later."

I'll never know what could've been,
If I never try...

Hopefully it'll work out for the best.  If not...at least I tried and I won't go on wondering what if?"

How can you not love it???  Well anways, today I woke up at about 11...which was about the latest I've slept into in a while...because I slept over at the neighbors and me n Joe didn't fall asleep 'till about 5...we weren't even tired.

I came home and baked cookies.  Yes...I actually baked cookies.  I was hungry and had nothing else to do so figured why not...oh and by the way they're awesome.  

Swam at the negihbors and won the Rudy Cup once.  After went to ump a game and found out I didn't have to stay because it was a forfeit but I did anways...oh well it was fun.

Now I think I'm gonna go swim at the neighbors again, so peace out everyone."

"event","Well I just got home from my baseball game and we lost...again.  It was close, only 7-4.  We know have lost our 10th game...out of 12 total games.  O well, I went 1 for 2 tho so it's all good.

Today was basically a layed back day.  Didn't and couldn't really do much.  Had to mow the lawn today...which is always a fun thing to do...not.  And while I was cutting it our neighbor's sprinklers went off, so I got a nice shower I didn't need.  After that I had to go to the doctors because I can't hear out of my left ear.  

Came back home, and went to the neighbors and played a little basketball.  Went back home got ready for baseball and went and played the game.  Now I'm here looking for something to do.  Anyways, comment and I guess I'll talk to you all later."

It's a long trip alone over sand and stone
That lie along the road that we all must travel down

So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
'Cause it's a long trip alone

It's a short piece of time but just enough to find
A little peace of mind under the sun somewhere

So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
You know we can't afford to let one moment pass us by
'Cause it's a short piece of time

And I don't know where I'd be without you here
'Cause I'm not really me without you there

Yea Yeah
Hallelujah hallelujah oh

So maybe you could walk with me a while
Maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold

So maybe you could walk with me a while
Maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Maybe I could feel right beside you 'til I'm home
'Cause it's a long trip alone"

"event","My car died yesterday. Yep, I was driving to work and it just died. It had been making noises for several days (probably an indicator that it was crapping out) and yesterday it died. So, I don't have a car for the time being and with my luck, fixing my car will probably end up costing me an arm, a leg and my soul. :-( Oh well. I'll have to take it to the mechanic soon and see what he says.

So instead of driving myself to work as usual, my sister dropped me off. I was 3 hours late and covering a shift at another store. Luckily, all the girls were really nice. I always feel funny working at another location. Anyway, yesterday I made 50 bucks in commission in 5 hours. I couldn't believe it! Actually, I CAN. This store happens to be in a ritzy area so people swipe credit cards with their eyes closed. I didn't even need to TRY and sell to anyone. All I did was smile and ask, ""Would you like a flat iron?"" and the customers went for it! I was so bitter. Our store has such a hard time selling commission items. I honestly think we're at a huge disadvantage. I really think our commission rate needs to be a little higher to make up for the huge gap. It just doesn't seem fair to me. Oh well. It was nice for a day. I should cover shifts more often. :-)

After work, my sister and her fiance took me to see ROCKY BALBOA! It was great! :-D It really exceeded my expectations. I probably cried a total of 6 times. LOL. I dunno. It was just touching. It was a good ending for a great underdog story. :-D Eye of the tiger, baby! Eye of the tiger!"

There's a big part of me who wants to experience the whole moving away to go to school thing, but I'm afraid I'll fail.

It was huge and looked leafy. I ran inside the house, grabbed a jar and captured it. I made holes at the top so it could breathe. Apparently, I caught a Green Lynx Spider. (I checked online and saw a picture of it.) It was so neat. I probably sat there for an hour watching it spin a tiny little silky line. Then I decided to kill a fly outside and feed it to him! I didn't think it would do anything, but he instantly grabbed the fly and started sucking on it or something! LOL. He was such an enthusiastic spider! I named him Billy Green. lol. Anyway, I only kept him in a jar until my parents came home so I could show him off. After that, I let him go in a tree. Yes, I had a nerdy moment today. :-D

After my interaction with Billy Green, I went to the gym and had a good workout. I seem to sweat a lot more these days, which is weird because I've never been much of a sweaty person when it comes to exercise. Anywho, I walked upstairs after cardio and started working on my thighs. This old lady was next to me with her VERY cute trainer. He walked away for a second and she turns to me and smiles. Then she says, ""He's very sweet!"" And I respond, ""And cute too!"" So then she's insisting I ask him out and all I'm thinking is, ""YEAH, A HOT TRAINER IS GOING TO WANNA GO OUT WITH A CHUBBY CHICK."" LOL. So I just laugh her remarks off and move on to the next machine. Well, the trainer returned and I glanced over and I saw her say something to him that made him chuckle and he turns to look at me! I was mortified! The little old lady told on me! LOL. Geez.

I spent most of my time there with my grandmother. She is such a beautiful person and leaving was really hard. I know in my heart I won't be seeing her again  because she's in her 90's and I don't know when I'll be able to go to Mexico again. 

So I spent most of my time with her. I videotaped conversations with her and took plenty of beautiful pictures. I also learned a great deal of family history which I found extremely fascinating. All these things made my trip there worth it. 

While it was only 8 days, it seemed like an eternity. I felt like such an outsider whenever I went into town. Seeing the poverty and feeling the struggle of the Mexican people made me realize why some of them are willing to die crossing the border into the U.S., which so many natural-born Americans take for granted. I think people who lack any kind of patriotism have never left the country. I think people who only see the negative in what our government has to offer have never personally seen the faces of hungry, tired and restless people. I think people who judge and criticize individuals of other nations don't realize how difficult it is to rise above cemented traditions and cultures. I never felt so fortunate in my life. It wasn't my first time in Mexico, but for some reason, everything seemed different to me. While I am Mexican-American, I realized that I am more American than I'll ever be Mexican. I hope that someday, Mexico can flourish into a stronger nation and it's people will want to stay and feel as grateful as I do living in the U.S."

AP
DETROIT (July 22) - A homeless man searching for returnable bottles in a trash bin found 31 U.S. savings bonds worth nearly $21,000 in a bag of clothes.


Charles Moore, 59, took the bonds to a 24-hour walk-in homeless shelter, where a staffer tracked down the family of the man whose name was on the bonds.


""They belong to him,"" Moore told The Detroit News. ""I did the right thing.""


Ernest Lehto's family had given away many of his clothes shortly after his death in 2004.


How the bonds ended up in the trash bin is a mystery, but Lehto's family left Moore a $100 reward.


""What a good Samaritan,"" said Neil Lehto, who picked up the bonds Friday that had belonged to his late father.

The worst pattern we follow: THE PEOPLE WE DATE.

Even in relationships, we tend to do things in a ""patternized"" way. Often times, it leaves us very vulnerable to getting hurt. The question is: Why is it so hard to break out of a dating pattern? When do we realize we've had enough?

Today, I hung out with my sister and my cousin Angie. We had a really good time. Of course little Josh tagged along as well (Josh is Angie's son...she is a single mom). It's really tough being a parent. While there are a few  reasons why I wouldn't want to be a mom, there are a gazillion reasons why I would and most likely will. I look forward to seeing how they'll look, how they'll act, how much they'll be like me or their future dad. I look forward to helping them become the best people possible. Enough about becoming a mom though. That is seriously light years away. Well, maybe not THAT long. Sometimes it feels like an eternity. Why rush it though?

Aside from the shinanigins with Josh, we had some great quality girl-time. We vented, analyzed, laughed, shared stories. It's nice to get different perspectives from the people you love and who love you. Whether or not there's a level of bias involved, it's always a good feeling to know that you're loved exactly the way you are and that you have an army of people who think you deserve the world.

I know...it sounds like the beginning of one of those lifetime channel movies about women with body issues, but my issues lie deeper than the way my boobs point or how I hate my thighs. I stared at myself a great deal and saw someone beautiful. Sure, I may not have seen the six pack of abs I want or the cute perky butt I keep seeing splattered all over the magazines. But I will get there someday. This week, as I busily worked myself out at the gym, I caught episodes of Oprah. One of her shows this week told the story of a young woman who was burned alive by her husband. It amazed me to see this woman sit courageously on the couch next to Oprah, and talk to her about her horrible experience. What really blew me away however, was the way she viewed herself as beautiful still, regardless of the scars that covered her entire body. Sometimes I forget that beauty is only skin deep. But then I see someone like this young woman and it humbles me a great deal. Although I am working hard to become a healthier person on the outside, I need to remember that my inside is just as important. One day, my skin will begin to wither. One day, my boobs will begin to sag. That's just life. No matter what happens though, I will always be beautiful."

This semester has really opened up my eyes about the future and what kind of professor I'd like to be. I definitely DON'T want to be like my math professor. It's almost as if he gets evil pleasure from watching us fail. He's nowhere near APPROACHABLE and I highly dislike him. Sometimes I don't understand why some people even go into teaching. All I know is that I want to be better than that someday. I want to help people find their inner voice through writing and perhaps help them find the simple pleasures of thought and life experiences that motivate our reasoning. I want to see people succeed, including myself. I just want this portion of life to reach its conclusion. I have to continue trying, even if this bastard of teacher fails me. I will not give up!

Well, as you last read, I told Matt how I feel. Some would have called it brave, others, plain out foolish, but it needed to be done, and I'm glad I did it. I have realized in the past few years that there is no shame in telling the truth. Being honest isn't always the easiest thing, but in the matters of the heart, it is essential to be honest, no matter what the outcome. 

So...I was completely honest. I wish I could say that the outcome was wonderful and that sparks flew and I'm totally and utterly in love now, but, it didn't quite turn out that way. In fact, I didn't expect it too. At first, I have to admit, I WAS heart-broken, crushed, disillusioned, etc. However, looking back at past entries, and upon receiving his response, I came to the conclusion that Matt isn't some unattainable God, rather, he's just another guy, passing me by for what are obviously superficial reasons. 

The fool, however, wasn't Matt. It was me. Foolish indeed for idealizing yet another passerby on my road to true love, a love in which I still believe in. It's the love that makes you stupid, makes you smarter and makes you believe in everything. I'm not apologizing for my feelings. My intentions were good and my heart, was in the right place. For that, I have no regrets.

Someday, I will meet someone great. Who knows? Perhaps I already have, and just don't know. That's the beauty of life and love. You never know what's waiting, and the happiness is in the discovery..."

So I go into work yesterday feeling good and optimistic. First thing that happens...I get sent straight into the office. Apparently corporate doesn't feel my position is THAT important. Therefore, I am now going from 80 hour paychecks to 40 hour paychecks. Yep. They are only allowing anyone who isn't an immediate mananger to work only 20 hours a week. Bullshit. Complete bullshit. So, with a month and a half left of summer, I now have to do what I tried to avoid all along...TWO JOBS. ""Sigh"" Why oh why?! It just stinks the major turd. 

I've been trying to remain positive though...I've actually begun to look into freelance writing opportunities. I think it's time I start to take risks with what small talent God has given me and try my luck in the writer's arena. I dunno...the worse that can happen is I get rejected...And anyone who knows me knows I do that VERY WELL.

I just can't wait until I'm sitting in my vanilla-cinnamon scented writing room, staring at the college degrees on my wall and knowing that all this time spent was worth it."

So far, the summer has been going as planned. I am slowly paying off my debt and continuing to shed the pounds off. 

Aside from that, I've come to the realization that having more than one romantic admirer is not all it's cut out to be. There is something tragically weird about not finding satisfaction in what many would call ""having options."" I know most people think I'm insane for passing certain dating opportunities by...but what it all comes down to is--I already know what I want. And unfortunately, WHO I want is still out there somewhere. But I totally have faith that God has someone perfect saved for me and that's all I need in my life. And I thank God each day that he helps me avoid ever settling for less, in more ways than one."

I did feel really bad for the girl who left home alone though. She was so classy about the thing. It totally reminded me of a situation I was in once. It sucks to have to be strong when all you want to do is curl up and cry.

"event","Yesterday, I left on a hopeful note about the male species and what they are capable of doing for the women they care about. Soon after, I engaged in an interesting conversation with my friend, Eric <lj user=phleck> about the most romantic thing he's ever done for a girl and when he couldn't remember exactly, he said that he hoped HE was interesting enough to the girl that romanticism was not needed. I told him I'd give him an F in this subject matter.

I actually find it quite funny now. I mean--how many men must believe this? Imagine if romanticism as we know it ceased to exist. This is what men fail to understand. They believe--mostly because they are, unfortunately, not only driven by testosterone, but EGO as well--that THEY themselves, are enough to make us go bonkers over them. Men may say that they like us for who we are and that's all they need, but this is, in fact, a lie. Our existence is not enough, which is why we work hard to prove that in many ways. One of the biggest differences between men and women is that men, after some time, can automatically shut down all thought processes and become vegetated into things such as video games and occasional porn sessions. Suddenly, the women in their lives become non-existent. Women, on the other hand, are gentle creatures, charged with highly emotional brains. Even when we attempt to distract ourselves from the men in our lives, something reminds us of them. It's true. We can be walking around the mall and suddenly  see a shirt on display and it happens. ""Aww! Billy has a shirt like that!"" Or we're driving down the beach and notice the car next to ours. ""Aww...Billy's always wanted that car!"" It's like a brain disease women have. However, this disease is also what draws men to feel intrigued by our existence. They thrive on the thoughtfulness of women. We nurture the ones we care about even when they're not around and we're constantly on a mission to better the relationship, even if there's a chance it might fail. We go to great lengths, often making ourselves uncomfortable in sexy lingerie or by sitting through a sport we don't care for. That's what WE do. If our existence WAS enough, we wouldn't take the time to curl our hair or apply that stupid bronzer on our cheeks to make our skin glow. But we do those things because we're hoping you'll take notice. Forget the fancy diamonds or ridiculously expensive roses. All we want is to know that you're thinking about us, the way we are often thinking about you. So guys, listen up. Romanticism does not depend on the credit limit on your Visa. It depends on how well you listen to the one you love."

"event","So this morning, I stayed in sick and I came to two conclusions.
One, there is no way one can survive  daytime tv without cable...and two, kids are, by far, the most inspirational creatures on Earth...and it's a shame that the world deteriorates about every ounce of charm they have by the time they reach adulthood...
Today, I got in touch with my inner child and decided to sit through an episode of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. I realize I could've watched a judge show or another amazing infomercial, but Mr. Roger's and I needed to play catch-up. So I watched...and it was about puppets getting married and then Mr. Rogers sang this little didley about love and how people will like you just the way you are and do amazing things for you. I then thought to myself that perhaps Mr. Rogers never tried dating in Southern California. 
Anyway, watching Mr. Rogers and all his optimism reminded me of how optimistic I once was as a little girl about love. I remember letting my imagination run away with me, dancing with my pillow to Gloria Estefan, thinking, ""One day, I'll meet a boy who will just grab me in his arms and dance with me--regardless of place or time.""
I mean, you grow up with all these hopes and dreams--IDEALISMS, better said--and you wait for them all to magically happen....but they don't. And suddenly all those little romanticized scenarios you imagined in your head as a kid become fuzzy, lost somewhere under a pile of reality. 
So I'm left to wonder.... Do women expect too much from men? Or are men just incapacitated to listen to a woman's real desires? Come on GUYS. We don't make you watch romantic comedies for nothing. You may think they were invented for strict female pleasure....No, no, no. The truth is, my testosterone-driven boneheads, they were created for you and you only, so that perhaps they could give you some ideas and fill that shallow part of your brain that triggers CREATIVITY. 
Alas, not all is lost. My hope is that someday idealisms become realities for not only myself, but some of my dear female friends. And maybe one day, I can replace my pillow with a man."

It's been over two years now, but saying goodbye to you still feels like yesterday.

Not a day goes by that I don't wonder how you're doing or pray for you, hoping you are well and happy. There have been times when all I've wanted to do was erase you from my memory...but then again, if I could, I'd erase one of the most important people that ever came into my life. Our friendship made me believe in the highest connections between two people and I thank you for that. Even though I may never understand why our connection was cut short of its potential, I will remember that at one point, it existed. 

I wish you all the happiness Life can offer, Azrag. I'll always love you. I still miss you.
Happy Birthday.

"event","This Terri Schiavo case is everywhere. It makes me question life and God...but most of all, ethics...I mean, in some way, I can understand where her parents are coming from...that IS their daughter. However, a part of me feels they are being selfish, wanting to keep her here physically, even if she is unable to do anything. I mean, all these people have tape over their mouths with the word ""Life"" on it...but what IS Life but the ability to actually LIVE? How does one ""Live"" without the capability to really feel, touch, see, and know? Terri Schiavo cannot even defend her own life, therefore, can it really be taken away? I just don't understand how some people are comparing this to abortion. In abortion, the potential for life is being destroyed. Terri Schiavo has no chance to ever really live again...I just don't see how they can be compared. I think her husband has the right to be able to move on...He has already lost his wife...I don't know what her parents are waiting for...."

After school, I ran a couple of errands with Ada and we watched Season 1 of ""The OC"". How I am addicted to this show? Probably just the music. Anything and anyone can steal my heart with a good tune. Bastardos. I'm so bummed I close at work tomorrow...No OC night for me. : P

Anyway, on my way home, I got a call from Mike! Yay! :) I really hate when we're both so busy with school and extracurricular jumbo! Sometimes we go months without hanging out. It's really a bummer! But...today we both had some time, so we made a coffee date. Of course I HAD to go to the gym first (working out later than 6 pm is just not my thing). Since I wanted to have enough time to take a shower and get ready, I did only 30 min of cardio--HARD RESISTANCE. Oi....Nothing better and worse than being soaked in that much sweat. So after that, I went to pick up Mike, who made me feel absolutely fabulous! :) Apparently I was ""glowing"" and seemed like a ""new, more confident Liz."" It made me feel really good. Anyone who knows Mike, like Melisa <lj user=felicaggie> knows that he is the most brutally--yet refreshingly honest person you can meet. I love him. :) It was really nice catching up and hanging at the Gypsy Den. It was a LATTE fun! Hehehehe. I'm such a nerd. : P At least now, I'm becoming a less-fat nerd. LOL.  I hear hot, thin nerds are the newest trend...lol. Ok, enough of my crap. :)

Why is it...or better yet, why does it seem that we sleep better during the cold season? I find it the hardest to wake up when I'm cold, but in the Summer, I pop right out of bed it seems. 
Anyway, that's my random inquiry for today. 

I love it when it's pouring out. I've never really been able to enjoy a good rainy day though...I always have to work or do something. What I really wish I could do one day is grab a blanket, rent some good ol' movies and just cuddle on my couch with someone ((laughs for a second)) while eating yummy popcorn and drinking hot chocolate. That would be absolutely perfect. Yeah well...maybe someday. For now, I just accept the fact that I'm sitting here, writing all this mumbo jumbo and that in about 4 hours, I'll be in the mall, working my charm on people, trying to convince them why our buy-one-get-one-free special is so beyond an excellent deal. <~That was a disgustingly long sentence. 
::Sigh::
Continuing with all these random thoughts...I woke up thinking about my old friend, Azrag today. Rainy days always remind me of him, mostly because he's the only person who loves the rain and fog as much as I do. 

I guess this leads to my next random thought and question for the day...

How many of you believe in soul mates--and if you do, what makes someone a soul mate?"

On another note...
Today, Ada drove by a place which I tend to avoid because all it does is bring back memories. Then we started talking...and before I knew it, there I was once again, reminiscing about something that never really was...and perhaps will never be. How do you keep faith in something that is constantly failing? Sometimes I feel like I'm walking backwards...heading toward the future, yet occupied looking at the past..."

I went to Padre Juanote's funeral. I can't believe the amount of people who showed up to honor this man...however, I am not surprised. I think I felt more sad today than when I initially found out. When someone close to me dies...it never really hits me until I see the casket and realize--""I am never going to see this person again...at least not for a while."" I really hate that part. I'm not very good at NOT missing people. I always miss those I've cared so much about. And I always feel like a part of my world is forever changed...and something about that always makes me feel a little less safe. Even when I was little, I always thought it'd be great to die with everyone I cared about, just so that I would never have to live a day here on Earth without them. Is that crazy? I don't really know. 
I will always find it amazing how life works. I mean--in the end, it's nothing but a world filled with arrivals and departures...The funny thing is, each hello and goodbye is just as intense, for your heart is filled with excitement for meeting someone new and with the same amount feeling is turned to sadness when you must say goodbye. And you wish you had every good memory recorded on a tape to watch it over and over because as we know, with time, memory begins to fade. But even then, you hardly ever forget those who have touched your heart. Even if you can't remember the exact details of that dinner you had, or the laugh you shared, you still remember them and how they made you a better person simply by being a part of your life."

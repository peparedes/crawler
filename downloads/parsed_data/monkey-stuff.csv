A good start to a brand new year.  Coffee, BrightEyes, Chocolate Mouth, LiveJournal.  To top it all off I'm all alone in the apartment - all weekend long.

I have to say, the wrapping up of 2004 sucked pretty hardcore.  I'm going into the new year with a lot stirring around in the old noggin.  So much that I'm beginning to feel numb to it all, again.  Seems to happen more than it should.

Switching to Elliott Smith now...maybe a new perspective will come from it...an extremely dark and depressing one!  No, I really want to try to be as positive and as optimistic as I once used to be.  It's not really a resolution, because as stated above they are a crock of shit.  It's much more important that that.  When I think of resolutions I think of quick fixes - quitting smoking, eating healthier, some bullshit like that.

I'm not sure what is going to happen with all of my un-fixed relationships, but I'm OK with that.  I know that eventually everything will fall into place.  Somehow it'll all work out, everyone will be happy, and I can continue to live guilt-free.

I'm ready for you, 2005, what'cha got for me?  I think I can handle it.  Man, I thought 2003 was a rough one...

Here's a little ""in memory of"" that I call-

2004:  What the fuck?!

Oh 2004, you crazy motherfucker.  There's a lot I'm gonna miss about you, we had some great times.  But with most things, we tend to remember the times that were a little less great and a little more, ""what the fuck?!""   Here's a little tribute to those times that I will never ever forget.

*winter living in chicago with matt & erik - who had an unspoken hatred of each other - in a cool big apartment that was constantly leaking and falling apart.
*continued to stay broken-up with John, continued to share a bed with John, continued to obsess and hate myself over Dave.
*finished up my last semester of college in LA with the semester in LA program.
*met Erick and Eric - ""really"" met Erick and started a path of heartbreak and confusion with yet another innocent boy.
*back in chicago then back in wheaton.  graduation.  now what?  unsure of my next move...contemplating the big move.
*freaking out about the big move.
*excited about the big move.
*the big move:  July 12th - two cars - Eric, Erick, Natalie and me. 
*3 and a half days to LA.
*2 weeks in LA with nowhere to live - constant fighting - the urge to stab Erick with any sharp object I can get my hands on.
*good-bye to Natalie, pondering becoming a lesbian.
*a month and a half of no job, no friends, a new place.
*still wanting to stab Erick, also wanting to kiss him.
*not wanting to stab Erick, kissing Erick.
*more than kissing Erick.
*waitressing in hell - Jerry's Famous Deli - I hate LA.
*the ole ""fuck you"" to Jerrys, like LA better, new job at Fear Factor.
*the ole ""falling in love"" with Erick.  Weirdness and awkwardness with other Eric.
*new job at Veritasiti - watching movies all day - good pay.
*new infatuation with john lennon obsessed indie boy at work.
*not so perfect with Erick.
*erick knows about john lennon obsessed indie boy at work.
*going home for christmas.
*finally getting the guts to run after Dave in the freezing cold, shaking, crying, a little drunk, and apologizing until my heart feels like it's going to explode.
*Dave kisses my check.  I melt.  I feel like things are resolved.  Everything is going to be OK.
*a friend at home tells me he's gay.  I'm shocked.  Supportive, but amazed.
*almost break-up with Erick.  He rips me apart - yells out my flaws - I am speechless and want to run away.
*feel like I don't belong at home, don't yet belong in LA.  
*obsessed with listening to BrightEyes.  Conor Oberst is the most attractive person I've ever seen.  Day dream marrying him.
*day dream about indie boy at work.
*day dream about the most wonderful boy that I already have.
*meet wonderful boy's sister and kids - decided he's a keeper.
*come back to LA alone.  Start to think too much all over again.
*day dream of indie boy again.
*decide i still don't know what the hell i want.
*decide i wanna live alone.  right now.
*back to usual confused self.
*2005 comes up behind me.  i want it to bring me good things.
*2005 is starring me in the face.
*12:56 pm.  saturday morning."

I'm not shocked for any reason at all, I just thought that little lemon face was funny.  

Well it's my morning ritual - about 5pm, drinking coffee, messing around online.  Today ""dunkers"" (best damn cookie Trader Joe's has to offer) is in the mix.  Trust me, those little cookies add a great deal of happiness to the start of my day.  :)

I decided late last night when I couldn't sleep that it's practically impossible to go home for Thanksgiving.  I really wanna go home.  Then again, Christmas is only a month after.

Besides being excited to see my family for the first time since July, I was also really looking forward to giving the old ""fuck you, I'm out"" to my job.  Ahhh, Jerry's Famous Deli, how I want to burn you down...again.  (The place actually did burn down about three years ago - most likely a disgruntled employee such as myself).

What's really kind of scary about my weird situation living here in LA is that no matter where I'm working, I have to quit in order to go home for the Christmas.  And what's worse is I have to find a new job the second I get back.  

My dream plan is to stick it out with Jerry's till December, go home for two weeks, then magically find a TV-related job in January.  Could it be done???  There's only one way to find out.  I somehow managed to survive work-free for the first month we were here.  

OK it's time for my six o'clock shower :)  I'm getting used to only two hours of sunlight a day..."

Its been about 3 weeks.  Maybe the most stressful/exciting/confusing 3 weeks I've had yet.  Definitely a mess of emotions. 

It's so weird here, I can't even begin to describe it.  One second I'm completely mesmerized by the change of scenery - mountains, palm trees, the ocean; and the next second I'm slapped in the face with something thats ""so L.A."" that it sickens me.

Basically by ""so L.A."" I mean the moving scenery- the people, the egos and attitudes, the hierarchy of an entertainment-run city.  It's so fucking ridiculous.  But I let it get to me way too easily.

I think I'm too cynical, too sarcastic to live here.  And honestly, I don't know how long I'll really last.  Especially without a job.  :)

I'm having Mike and his girlfriend over for dinner so I figured since I'm not doing much of anything else...why not make the dinner my entire day.
It's only 3:45 and I've already bought all of my secret ingredients, made brownies, started the twice-baked potatoes, and cleaned the kitchen.
I know what you're thinking, HUGE dork.  But its been kind of nice.  I've got my stereo turned one notch below shaking the house, and I've been taking breaks from the cooking to play on the computer.  

Ever since I've been back from L.A. I've felt the bummiest I've ever felt in my life.  I know I'm done with school, and not that I've ever really put a great amount of effort into it before, but I feel like I should be doing something school-related. 
The worst part is the boredom.  Since I only work on the weekends and couldn't really find another job (although I could have tried a little harder) I have a pretty blank schedule mon-fri.
But of course, with everything, good has come from my boredom too.  Things that once seemed very little and insignificant are now brought to life.  By ""things"" I mean practically anything that doesn't involve the couch or TV.
Walking to the jewel was like an adventure today, secretly spying on everyone else who was outside, looking inside store windows and just enjoying the fact that I was outside of the apartment.

So, I'm going to continue on with my meal plans and pretend I'm a professional chef for the rest of the afternoon.  A professional chef that insists on listening to radiohead and alkaline trio while preparing the food."

Who the hell am I kidding, I can't think of relateable analogies.  I tried.  Good enough I say.  Srew you, Columbia.  After three years and now graduated I still can't even try to sound like a pretentious artsy kid.  They suck anyway.  Assholes.

Then I thought about what the F I'm going to say when I see him and got nervous.  Still nervous, still happy, various emotions, the usual.
I'll probably try to apologize for whatever has happened now years ago, awkward enough.  Needless to say, it'll be an interesting evening.  I have no idea what the outcome will be.

today i had a chance to chat with a long-lost friend.  i hadn't talked to this person in almost 3 years, so although our conversation was short, we had much to talk about.
i guess i hadn't thought about it in much detail, but seeing how far she had come since i'd known her as a freshman/soph in college made me think about my own journey.  
it's so strange to look back on yourself and wonder if you ever thought then what you would be doing now.  i'd say overall i'm pretty happy with where i'm at right now, but i don't think the real journey has begun yet.  and maybe i am ready, more than i thought.
when you're younger, everyone likes to tell you about the ""stages"" of life you'll be going through in years to come, but most likely at a younger age you tend to only focus on the present, not the future - what boys i like, will i pass this test, what i'm going to do this weekend, etc.
but you grow up and more and more you focus on the future, and sometimes forget to just enjoy the present before it passes you by.
i think right now i am in the infamous transitional stage.  i'm kind of in between young adulthood and actual adulthood, and really, the only thing that's going to push me into the ""actual"" direction is me.
i guess it's about time to begin a new stage, see how it's gonna play out, maybe start getting the respect i deserve!  jk, i don't even know i meant by that.

Things will get taken care of, I know this.  But the more people who stress me out about it, the more I'm becoming one of them.

There are things that are more important to me in my life then, well, me.  My family, my friends, taking the time to be with these people, have fun, do things I like to do, make other people happy, finding happiness in little things...
These are some of the little things that make me happy:
watching my cats do funny things.
laying around with someone watching tv.
listening to a CD i haven't listened to in a long time.
listening to a CD that i can't go a day without.
having conversations about the most random things, for hours.
reminiscing with friends about the stupid things we've done.
doing stupid things with friends- (riding the handicap carts at meyers and getting kicked out)
going for walks to get ice cream.
driving around my neighborhood by myself.
drinking an insane amount of coffee and chain-smoking with a friend.
noticing the person in the car next to me dancing, singing, or picking their nose.
staying in my pajamas all day long.
going an entire night without checking the time.
playing video games and kicking everyone's ass.  (this only applies to dr.mario, mariokart, supermariobrothers 3, and on good days, bond 007)
listening to my dad's family talk about funny childhood stories.
playing pool in a cold basement with blaring music.
sitting back and just listening to the people around me, taking it all in.

It's definitely one of those shows that you remembered obsessing over and continued to hold it so high even though you hadn't seen an episode in years.  Of course, when you do see one again (now that I have every episode on dvd, thanks Dave) it's never quite as amazing as you remembered.  But it's still good.
There's still something about that one episode (in which this song is from) that just gets me.  I could watch it over and over and by the end I'll still be completely enthralled in it all, like I forget where I am when it's over.  It's hard to describe, it's just really good.

When we were driving home my watery eyes didn't clear-up as I'd hoped they would- in fact, I became really emotional (something that isn't rare for me) and before I knew it my head was filled with everything and anything that I had been thinking about, for the past few days, for the past few years.

I don't know why I have such a hard time letting things go, but I do.  As much as I look forward to change and new beginnings I am deathly afraid of moving on from the comfortable and often boring life I've become accustom to.

OK, I guess it's not always boring, maybe lonely is a better way of putting it.  Sometimes the loneliest parts are when I'm surrounded by the people I used to be extremely close to.  And the ""used to"" is what makes me feel like I'm on my own. 

But anyway, it's a new year, right?  Not like we actually get a clean slate to start over with, but at least I can go into it with a different attitude.  Starting....now.  :)  2004, you better be good to me, I need a good one."

Anyway, I'm eating my ""tart"" granny smith apple right now.
A boring Wednesday evening.  I decided to write my paper that is due tomorrow.  I mean, what the hell, I'm not doing anything else.
A certain beeotch was supposed to call me tonight, however, I won't name names.  If you know me, and you can figure out by beeotch I'm referring to a she (something I normally would not encourage doing) then you know by the number of girl friends I actually have who I am probably talking about.
But moving on...I got a reply from someone who normally doesn't reply to my - as he put it - ""melodramatic"" e-mails.  Again, if you know me, you know who I am talking about.  But who am I kidding, no one reads this shit.  :)
I don't know why, but whether or not the reply was negative or positive didn't even matter to me.  Just the fact that he wrote me back is enough to make my heart race and feel some-what better.  Of course, it wasn't really positive but I guess it wasn't really that negative either.  Depends on how you look at it.  And still, through out this never-ending saga (as my mom refers to it as) I continue to remain an optimist. 
I found this quote today by Mahatma Gandhi that I really liked - ""Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.""
Ending on an uplifting note, I will say adios for now."

Damn you, milk!  Damn you!
Anyway, let's move on.  Guess where I'm headed this weekend?  Yes, home again for little Claire.  The fourth weekend in a row.  Can I pay half my rent considering I'm here about half the month?  :)  Seriously, I have no choice sometimes.  
Girl's gotta make a living somehow you know.  And since the retards at my catering job ""don't have anything available this weekend"" (bitches) I have to go home to work for mommy and daddy.
Hey, I shouldn't complain.  What's better than working in your pajamas, stuffing your face and watching Spongebob while you stamp 500 envelopes?  NOTHING!
It's actually gonna be a pretty busy weekend, for once.  Not sure if I can fit all I want in, but I'll give it the girl scout try.
This is what I have in mind:
Thursday: classes (blah), train it home, visit natalie at work.
Friday: work, ikea, possibly badly needed hair-cut.
Saturday: work, work, insert hair-cut here if needed, drive natalie's car to city for Mike's, drive back to burbs when sober.
Sunday: work, train it back to city, happy birthday Mattie!  And at midnight, a very happy 21 for John!
Somewhere in the mix of the weekend ""birthday present shopping"" will fit in.
I guess written out it doesn't seem so bad.  Then again, I'm used to sitting on my ass and lifting my finger to change channels.  
Man I can not wait for ""senior seminar"" (best class ever) tomorrow!  Can we please do more class activities such as - pair up with someone and explain to them what it's like to be you.  AHHHHHH SHOOT ME NOW!!!! 
Anyone care to join me for a jolly puke?
I have to say, I am looking forward to going home.  Minus the work it should be pretty fun.  Looking at pretty things that for once I can afford (thank you for the gift certificate, John!) Getting rid of what I think is beginning to look all too close to a mullet.  And hell, getting fucked up is always sure to be a blast.
So look out weekend, here I come!"

Lately I have been obsessed with stupid computer games.  Damn you, Matt, for introducing me to this sick new life-style.  Pathetically, I'm hooked.  At least I'm not denying it.
For one, they're fun as hell, especially when you're making little wagers on each game..
And two, it's just nice to have something to take your mind off of stuff you really don't want to think about.
The funny thing though, is when I'm playing these word games (finding and making words from various letters) certain words will hit me with memories and I get into this zone of not even paying attention to what I'm doing, just clicking on letters, forming words, but my mind is completely somewhere else.
It's like when you're driving and your body just takes over.  You're engulfed in deep thought and the next thing you know you're in your drive way thinking, how did I get here?
I'll spell out J-E-T and immediately I think of the band (who I am listening to right now) Jets to Brazil.  That makes me think of Dave, and then my mind begins to go into overdrive.
I spell P-O-T and start thinking about Natalie.  And this has been a biggie on my mind this past week (Natalie, not pot) since there's a whole mess of stuff there.
Of course the only words that really stand out like this are the ones that are associated with the shit you can't stop thinking about.
Stupid shit!!
The funny thing is after spelling out a memory-provoking word, I'll find S-A-D in the mix, or even earlier today I found A-L-O-N-E.  Coincidence?  Yeah, probably.  
Anyway, enough stupid shit.
I turned in my math mid-term today, confidently.  And I'm sleeping-in tomorrow morning.  Senior seminar, you can kiss my ass and go on with out me tomorrow.
Until next time, say no to games.  Yes to drugs."

This weekend was hell.  As cheesy and cliche as it sounds, I just have to tell myself that we learn from our mistakes.
Because that's what life is.  One big confusing learning experience. 
That might not be the case with me yet.  I guess it takes some of us longer than it does others.
But no one really knows what they're doing.  And you may not mean to hurt anyone, but sometimes shit just happens.
You know what really gets me sometimes?  When people say that when all is said and done, they want no regrets.  I guarantee NO ONE can look back on their life and not have anything they haven't regretted doing.
I'm only 22 and I have a few biggies in that department.  But the way I see it, you gotta look at it positively.  It could be worse.  You have to live and move on.  And above all, you have to enjoy living.
What a waste of a life if you're going to be down, depressed and regretting everything.
Good things can come from bad.
Often good things come from the worst situations.  You just gotta look for it."

It sucks when you're restricted to going to certain places because you know you're not wanted.
Tonight, Mike is at the grand opening of Corner Pocket - the bar his brother works at.  Cheap drinks, new couches, lots of people, good times.  When he told me this, yesterday, I thought that sounded fun and casually said, ""well, maybe I'll stop by.""
Turns out it would be best if I not go.  Or as he put it - ""well, it's just gonna be me and Dave, so...""
Yeah, that's right.  A slap in the face.  Or maybe more like a kick to the mouth.
""I mean, you can stop by if you want..."" he tries to reassure me.  
Who the hell wants to ""stop by"" when you know the person there really doesn't want to see you.  Why would I want to ruin his night?
I now realize the worst feeling in the world.  The fact that someone who you were once in love with, your best friend, your soul mate, the one you felt so comfortable around, who felt the same about you, now wants absolutely nothing to do with you.
Yeah, tonight is a drinking night.  I'm on a mission to drown these thoughts."

Lately all I have been listening to is Elliott Smith.  I had his CD ready to go and set to wake me this morning.  
Rather than being awaken by song, I was awoken by our damn creeky floor above me, and loud foot steps.
When I saw Erik sitting on the stairs, I could tell something was up.  He told me that Elliott Smith had committed suicide.
Starting the day off with the death of someone you really admire just can't be pleasant.  
All I thought was, ""but he's such a great musician.."" 
After that my morning was spent rather quiet but relaxed - making my endless pot of coffee, and egg sandwich, reading several different articles on his death - all of course while listening to his CD.
I just didn't feel myself today, but I don't think it's completely due to the depressing news of this morning.
I think besides guilt, the worst feeling is loneliness.  I haven't really felt this lonely in a while.  I miss my friends.  I miss a lot of things.
Sometimes I feel like the only things that keep me from going insane are Matt and John.
Today was a lonely day.

An example, the kid sitting in my arts therapies class tonight(who isn't even in the damn class, I guess he had nothing else better to do then to tag along with his ""I'm so punk-rock"" girlfriend) said about a dozen times to the teacher, ""umm yeah, I'm gonna have to disagree.""

For the past two years I've been preoccupying my mind with all sorts of things, dating new people, ""school"", work, but there's the one thing that I can never really completely cover-up.  It's always there, and I can be happy, but then it'll just show up, and my happiness fades.
I never thought that one person would have such an impact on my thought process.  I never imagined that I would be able to maintain a pretty serious relationship with someone while still trying (or not trying) to get over someone else.
So I wrote him another e-mail.  I know, bad idea.
And not to mention the fact that I am a horrible person.  I think I'm generally a good person, I don't mean harm to anyone, but the fact that I just said goodnight and I love you to my boyfriend on the phone, and an hour later am completely depressed about a different person, is down right wrong.
I don't know what to do anymore.

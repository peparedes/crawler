Padma--

I'm sorry we didn't make it to Eeylops this weekend. I would've gone with you, but... we seem to have gotten very good at avoiding each other these past few weeks, I suppose.

I just... I wanted to say that I'm sorry. For all the hell I put you through. I really haven't an excuse, to be hones, the Best thing I can say is that I was... under a spell. (By the way, Charlie Weasley is the resident Knight in Shining Armor for Hogwarts. He can even carry a damsel in distress back to her home.)

I know what I did was mean. It was horrible. It was all the things I grew up wanting not to be. If God were to give me another favor in life (the first of which was being able to spend <i>any</i> time with you at all), it would be to undo it. There's not a thing I regret more.

I still love you, Padma. With all my everything. We're... we're but a few steps away from one another, during the day, but those few steps become a gaping chasm, ready to swallow me into the earth, chew me up, and spit me out. And I know I'm a damned fool, and a coward, for not risking it. But... hey, if I'm going to embarrass myself in front of the person whose opinion matters most to me, I might as well do it looking my best, right? Right.

I realize that in writing this, I've just destroyed any lingering possibilities there may have been for us to be more than just passing acquaintances, girls who see each other every day but never really got to know one another. For that, I sincerely apologize. Please understand, though, you had to know this. I had to tell you.

You were my everything, my love, my true happiness. You were the light that never went dark, even in stormy times such as these. I was head over heels for you.

I still am.

All my undying love

Which might be true, as I kept waking up in the middle of the night. Crying. And I've no clue at all what I was dreaming about that made me so upset.

And no, I didn't figure anything out, Charlie."

Just keep repeating that to yourself, Sophie. If you do it'll come true."

... Charlie, we've never played chess. Why do I seem to think we have, even though I know for a fact we haven't?"

"event","Well, I suppose a post about my weekend is in order, so here goes.

I got home on Friday, and by that time I was both tired and hungry, so I had a snack and went to sleep. Go me.

On Saturday, since the entire house woke up rather late, we went out to brunch at some restaurant, I can't remember the name. Then we got back, and they wanted to know how I was, and what had happened since the beginning of the year. I told them, but selectively edited so they wouldn't get worried and transfer me. They were both sad when I told them what had happened with Padma, but Dad said, and Mum agreed, that it was the best thing to do. 

I saw Mere on Sunday!! She only came over for about an hour, during which Dad made himself scarce by cleaning in the kitchen, but it was really nice to see her anyway. And she brought Poly, and I have to say that I have the most adorable niece <i>ever</i>. She even smiled and gurgled at me a few times!"

Padma--

I'm extremely sorry that I didn't send this to you on your actual birthday, though it's only to be expected of a dolt like I am. I hope you'll accept the gift anyway.

Well, I know that you and Parvati sent the owl you were sharing back home, and you were planning on waiting till Christmas to get a new one. Use the school owls till then. But I figured you shouldn't need to wait that long. You're worth it, anyway.

If you take the slip of paper to the main desk at Eeylops, the person there will look at it for a moment, then tell you to pick an owl out. Any owl. Pick one you like. I've been in there, and there were some fairly nice ones.

Happy happy belated birthday. Enjoy your seventeenth year.

Sophie"

Anyway, happy happy happy belated birthday. I hope you enjoy being sixteen!

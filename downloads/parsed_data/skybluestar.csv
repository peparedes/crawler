You just eat Paczki's because it only comes around once a year and they are the best freaking things in the world. Or so I say and think anyways. They are only like 400 calories a piece plus some, and have about 25 grams of fat each. No worries...nothing some time on the treadmill can not take care of!!! Of course, that will be tomorrow's job...since I will be tired today after work...I lied, I will be lazy from all the Paczki fat weighing me down. PACZKI PACZKI PACZKI PACZKI PACZKI PACZKI <br />WHOOPTY DOO! <br />Ok sorry....I feel a little relieved now. <br /><br />I definitely need to get a new pic on there....the black and white one is a little out dated <br />maybe laster...don't have the resourcces here to take care of it.</em> <br /></font></font><br /><u><font color=""#ff6600"" size=""2"">Here's a little something interesting for everyone--------------&gt;</font></u> <br /><br /><strong>Recently Marines in Iraq wrote to Starbucks because they wanted to let them know how much they liked their coffee and to request that they send some of it to the troops there. <br /><br />Starbucks replied, telling the Marines thank you for their support of their business, but that Starbucks does not support the war, nor anyone in it, and that they would not send the troops their brand of coffee. <br /><br />So as not to offend Starbucks, maybe we should not support them by buying any of their products! As a war vet writing to fellow patriots, I feel we should get this out in the open. I know this war might not be very popular with some folks, but that doesn't mean we don't support the boys on the ground fighting street-to-street and house-to-house for what they and I believe is right. <br /><br />If you feel the same as I do then pass this along, or you can discard it and no one will never know. Thanks very much for your support. I know you'll all be there again when I deploy once more. <br /><br />""Semper Fidelis."" <br />Sgt Howard C.

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6600>so i have decided on not deciding on anything in my life right now. i mean, there is just to much going on and to much that i want to do that i feel like i dont have enough time to do it all carefully. i dont want to feel rushed on or about anything. i dont want to feel pressured or guilty for not doing certain things. it all seems like a bunch of shit.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6600>plus i dont even really know what <U>i</U> want anymore. if i sit and try to think about it i kinda freak out. i stress and worry about more things that i should even be thinking about. there is so much i want to do this year that i did not complete last year and just dumb little things that i didnt get to do or places i didnt get to go to. but i always feel restricted cause of my work schedule and financial issues. its hard to see what your spending your money on when you dont know where it goes.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6600>my uncle and i had a financial discussion about savings and keep tabbings and all the liking. i guess how he put it into perspective, it made sense but i still didnt have the answers i needed or wanted.&nbsp; i feel like theres alot piled on my plate right&nbsp; now and that this 'heap' may never diminish. i know it has to. just when and how are the questions that need answers.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6600>like they say, if it isnt one thing then it is another. once you get one mess cleaned up and straightened then another one just comes along and is even bigger then the one before! but you know, what else can you expect? NOTHING ELSE</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6600>life is just full of <EM>soooooooo</EM> much drama. but that is the least to be expected.... oh well</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6600>gotta go...time for work again for now...i got distracted and forgot what i wanted to beeyatch about</FONT></STRONG></P>"

"event","So, I fell into the gaping hole of the ""myspace"" blitz on the internet. I was gonna create one just for Shits and Giggles....not that it isn't part of the reason I did, but I like screwing around with it. Just seeing who you can meet and all. Definitely do not want any freaks, stalkers, creeps, etc. But you can learn alot of things about alot of people on there and talk to people from your old schools, etc. I still need to learn how to do the pics and everything on there...get some type of a cool background. 
Anyways, I'm just bored at work, sitting here on the second day of the year. Wishing there were something else to do...but alas, I can not read the entire time because you know...""it looks bad"" and I should have something else to do besides twittling my thumbs and reading? But if the S.O.B. would have given us Dec. 26th and today (Jan 2nd) off, we wouldn't have to worry about that now would we? But he is cheap and god only knows who might show up to buy cars the day after the holiday....even though technically, today is the recognized holiday but the state and all, eh, who cares cause he is CHEAP. 
Anyways...I think I am about done bitching about that for now....all I need to do is to go to school and get my degree & I can have a normal job where I would not be working today. My friend works for JEWISH DR's. and even she has today off. That is crap right there.
I  dont really have much else to say 'cept if you wanna check my blurb out on my myspace, the addy for it is

"event","<P>Thank god&nbsp;I am not a bartender. I, <U>somewhat</U>, followed the directions on the back of the ""long island ice tea"" mix....but the shit don't taste right.&nbsp;I purchased this ""mix"" from the Duty Free Shop on the Canadian side last night. It's a mixture of triple sec, vodka, gin &amp; rum and then you mix that with pop and like 1 1/2 oz. of limeade.&nbsp; I don't know for sheezie, but it don't taste like how Adina makes it. I'll have more <EM>good</EM> Long Islands' on Wednesday night though 'cause I don't got to work on Thursday because of the turkeys! Last night I made a run to Canada to purchase some choc-o-lat and some liquor. And I diddle daddled for a while before that. But I was coming back through customs on the U.S. side and the assholes made me pull to the right for a vehicle inspection!&nbsp; So I had to go sit in this office while one chci search my vehicle and the other ran a check on my ID. I got out 10 minutes later...but I was freakin out and kinda mad. Damn Americans!!!!</P>
<P>Anyways, more to post later....chattin ' it up now and don't have time to write.</P>"

thanks for hanging with me on saturday, steve. i appreciate it. we had some good times. thanks for being there. yea for $4 beers and seeing chris. there was some 'win a jeep' thing going on. but i didn't enter to win 'cause..i just didn't, ok? 

yea for noodles in a box and salads in a box.

i think i have second thoughts. on things.

i quit trying to try for certain things cause it wastes my time. don't include me on it, cause that's to much to ask for.  you can go to hell.

let us see how long i can go without seeing before it gets realized.

"event","it's been some time since i've written in here...somethings have happened in my life recently...my Grandma passed away on September 29th and was put to rest the weekend of the 1st. Trip to Canada and back...that is where her final resting place is...with my Grandpa. She was 91 years old and would of made it to 92 on Dec. 19th. She had 10 kids, four who died before her plus her husband that died Feb 8., 1984. She came to Canada from Europe with 6 kids in tow and gave birth to my mother later in Canada. The other two kids had come to Canada earlier w/Grandpa and Lucienne died during the war due to crib death. So she had a good,long, hard 91 years of life.  The following Thursday, Oct 6th, I got all of wisdom teeth extracted...still hurts today...10 days later. I actually think today is the first day they haven't bled when I woke up. That can only be a good thing....must be trying to heal then. Today I'm not quite sure what is going down. Yesterday I was out at Blake's Apple Orchard in Armada. Had a good time there...I got a pumpkin and $8 worth of apples, some cider and donuts. Can't complain except it was a little windy...as it seems today is. And I saw a few brown and black caterpillars. Petted some of those. Steve & I went out to Record Time in Ferndale where I found and purchased the Deep Dish CD I was looking for. I havent bought a CD in like over a year...then we had a few beers @ BWW and I saw Chris there from work with his jeep buddies. Then in the 45min-hour we were there, we witnessed four glasses breaking. 3 all behind the bar, and one right behind Steve's chair that had been full of red wine. Thank god it didn't splash at me or I would've had some problems! Went to Darin's house and hung out for a few hours with some people. Lefted there about 1:30ish...got home bout 2ish and went down for the night. And now here I am letting all you freaks know. The cat is crying at me and Moby looks bored so I better liven things up 'round here.

Love, Peace & Chicken Grease (as niCOLE would say)"

"event","<P>So, two bottls of wine and a few Vicodin don't get you&nbsp;to far on a Saturday night. Hmm....wonder WHY?&nbsp; Not to say I didn't have fun tonight but it is only 12am and well....my mind tends to wander towards other parts of the night that still have not happened. It's ok.&nbsp; Bar time is coming up soon along w/some...things to make it better that I am saving. No need to worry about those.</P>
<P>For those of you who called me in the last few days, thank you. I love you guys. You're greatly appreciated for checking in on me to make sure I did not bleed to death or do something else. Due to my having teeth ripped out.....to those who did not call...don't bother,ever.

<P>Don't ask bout last night, cause I won't remember tonight to well.&nbsp; I am hungry &amp; can barely eat. So much to do yet so little time left. I don't wanna work on Monday....fuck...To those of you who know: I LOVE&nbsp; YOU</P>

<P>I gotta go and get some more to drink before the glass runs low. See ya'all next weekend..............................................</P>

"event","Getting things for free isn't always everything. I do think it is kinda shitty that you can't look up people in MI or anywhere else that use livejournal unless you're a paying member. How cheap is that. I think I only paid for like 6 months,upfront, and then never used any of the features I could of by being a paid member. Everybody always wants something. They say the good things in life are for free. But what is free that is good? Unless it's sex from your man....that's always free. Anyways, sorry, mind is in the gutter.Tomorrow is yet another episode of ER Season 11, Yeeeaaaa!    
So I'm thinking some kind of cider mill ordeal should be in order cause this weekend will be good for it. Perhaps even some apple picking. Although I don't know if he's all up for that. I think it is cute and romantic and a good thing to do with your 'smoochie'. That is just me though. Maybe tomorrow will be...
Hmmmmm...so I'm thinking tostitos and jalepeno cheese dip are good ER time or tonight time. Don't really know what I will be doing TV wise. I have to call Comcast & give them some $$ and put a shitload of clothes away...I literally mean that too. Every day this week I've gotten pissed trying to find socks for work cause I have to search through a mound of clothing....un-believable! 
Friday night we are going to the bar, yeaa. I'm excited, first time really going to a bar per say here. Good times to come. Hope it ain't to cold....oh well, not like we are gonna be outside anyways.
Potatoes are good. S'ghetti tomorrow. Gots to go, almost time for lunch. I'm gonna get BK 
I'm getting a little nutso now anyways."

"event","<P>I decided that vampire vodka &amp; koolaid are the perfect after work drink mix for when you're nervous. I can't say why I'm nervous 'cause I don't want certain people to find out. I don't really know what is going on with to much right now. I kind of want to cry so I will feel a little better &amp; I haven't cried in forever. Except for two weeks ago when I was told my Grandma is slowly dying....that's a whole other fiasco.There are so many things I want to say to someone and some people but I'm so afraid to 'cause&nbsp;I don't know what they will think or say. But I'm afraid if I fail to say anything, it will only make it worse. I really wish someone could help me. I really wish I knew what certain people think &amp; how certain people feel. But unfortunately, unless they speak up, I never will. Why is everything so confusing and difficult?&nbsp; Things will never be simpler especially if people don't try and make them that way. I don't know why I bother sometimes.</P>
<P>So, I had this odd dream the other night. I had a dream I was dating someone and they asked me to marry them and I say 'yes'. Granted, I don't know who he was because I could never see his face but I said yes anyways to this stranger. So we were at the altar, except he was the one coming down the aisle. And there was something over his face again. And he got up to me &amp; took it off and although I knew but didn't know who he was, I was ecstatic. So the ceremony went on, yadda yadda. End of story. So I'm going to marry someone I don't know that well? I don't know what the point to that was. I'm all happy 'bout marriage...but I wanna know to whom I'm marrying. Weird..</P>
<P>So, I've been doing alot of thinking about a lot of things I can't really say exactly cause.....well, don't matter why. But I feel I have a sevenyearitch. Sounds dumb, I know, go ahead &amp; laugh. I really want a house and all but I don't wanna live alone and I don't know where I can find a roommate and I 'm a bit scared 'bout finding one on-line. And I'd rather have the house in my name so if something bad happens&nbsp;that&nbsp;they move out and all, not me. So I don't&nbsp; have to worry about like selling the house and splitting the money between us, ya know? So if you know of anyone interested in rooming w/someone, let me know. If it is a girl, she can't be sloppy.</P>
<P>Something stinks funny.</P>
<P>Anyways, I'm bored of this. Don't really enjoy being on-line that much anymore. See ya</P>"

"event","<P>so i was sitting there the other day wondering about a lot of things, and i asked myself. if you really believe in everything around you, do you know everything about it? and if you know everything around you, do you have to believe in it all? i suppose you only really know what you believe. there are a number of things i believe in....but i don't know if i will ever come across them in my life. only time will tell what one will run into. </P>
<P>anyways, i am kinda hoping it will not rain this weekend...at least not like sunday, or not to massively....i'm really looking forward to attending the state fair since last year i missed the wonderful event due to prior obligations in NC...not to say my time down there was not enjoyable, i just really wanted to see a cow be born and this year i am all about milking the cow AND of course the 25cent bottomless glass of milk. that is something few people know about it since the tent is in the back and no one wanders around the entire area like i enjoy doing. i hope i will be allowed to wander this year.</P>
<P>dream cruise next weekend, aug 20th...not sure what is going on yet....hopefully nonstop drinking all weekend...well, i will have to stop for some amount of time of course....but sunday will be lazy days for me for sure. </P>
<P>also debating on grocery shopping tonight...perhaps late friday night depending on what goes on, but i might be a little too 'fuzzy' to wanna drive and shop....first things first: make a grocery list</P>
<P>wish i had my own pool to swim in instead of a public pool. oh well, one can only hope</P>
<P>a little less than two hours until lunch time. go home and make something. pb &amp; j?&nbsp; turkey? one can only imagine what they will eat. i do need some other lunch ideas though. hmmm...if anyone has any suggestions, limmie know!</P>

<P>If you can understand that, then perhaps you might be able to help me. Although a person can only be helped so far in life and can only be helped so much. The rest depends on the one who is in need of help. Sometimes I wonder what people are thinking when I sit and watch them go on their merry way. Do they really understand everything that goes on in their lives? NO. Sometimes I really wish people would understand the simple things in life...although for the dumbasses out there, it is impossible. So far I can pretty much definitely say that this week kinda sucks. I have had better.Now it is raining, which makes my hair all frizzy and I am debating about what to do for lunch.

I guess all that underage drinking made 21 not seem like a huge deal...except now I do not have to depend on other people to get me liquor. So I went to lunch with my cousin at Mr. B's, and did enjoy myself. Went back to work where I cut my papercut from Tuesday with another papercut. Went out to eat with mom, Tom &amp; Justin for dinner where I enjoyed a strawberry daquiri (sp?). Mom was kind of funny bout it....it is okay though. Went home to relax and I went to the store to buy some beer just because I <U>legally</U> could...and I wasn't ever carded... could of gone the day before my birthday and done the same. </P>
<P>Oh well, now I am a <EM>old maid</EM> ha ha ha ....joke!&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonight Dad &amp; I are going out to eat somewhere, not sure where. He just said it was out near Opdyke road. So we shall see. Good times with the dad.&nbsp;And then when I&nbsp;get home, I will probably pass out and go to sleep so I can wake up to Friday morning!</P>
<P>I&nbsp;wonder about certain people sometimes but I&nbsp; have learned not to worry and wonder to much because sometimes they just are not worth&nbsp;it.&nbsp;There is no point in&nbsp;wasting your time on someone who does not give a shit.&nbsp;Maybe when they learn to give a shit is&nbsp;then when I&nbsp;will worry and wonder, until then, K.M.A.</P>
<P>I&nbsp;can at least say, due to certain aspects of my life, I am&nbsp;quite&nbsp;happier now than I ever have been. Definitely enjoying a certain somebody. Enjoy what I'm doing and what has been going on in my life. Definitely intrigued on where things could be going, meaning every thing and every direction of my life.</P>

I hope it is that way tomorrow as well cause I am going to go to my cousins in St. Clair Shores and swim in her pool and be burnt like a bad piece of toast. The air has been literally running all day long and it will not stay cool in here. The damn sen shines on my building from around noontime until sun down so it kind of sucks. Plus they cut down the tree that was in front of my unit so there is nothing to block me. I should of gone out today because with my luck, tomorrow will me shitty and rainy. That is just what happens. 
Yea for bonfires. Tonight is Steve's bonfire, this will be fun.
Good times...or so I hope.  I will se Stac....haven't seen her ass in ages! Literally, her ass. Ha ha

I tried to take a nap a couple hours ago so I would not be sleepy later, but no such luck. No sleep when it is bright inside the house I guess? So I did my vacuuming duty of the ferret room, fun!

Wednesday is the fireworks downtown, that will be fun. Haven't been theer in 3 years. I went when I gradgimatated with the -ex and that was it.  I will enjoy it.

"event","<P>So, Comcast screwed me over,again. I spent three hours on the phone with them over a 8 day period, only to find out what I alerady knew. There was a problem with my modem and the servers so I had to go on <EM>my <U>lunchbreak</U></EM>&nbsp;<U>&nbsp;&nbsp; to </U>Comcast to get a new modem. So Comcast credited my account one month and four days. So by early Saturday morning, it was working.&nbsp; The agony...</P>
<P>I went to Steve's Friday night and hung with him and Chris until&nbsp;I had way to much to drink that was safe for me to drive. But I successfully made it home safely. Although I did bought puke out my window turning onto Rochester from 15 but the cool air stopped me. I puked about 20min later though, when I was at home. And then I got up and went out and came back home at 11 and puked up all the apple juice&nbsp;I had that morning. That was icky. Spent most of the day not eating,drinking but laying out at the pool where I accidently laid out to long on my back letting my front of me get burnt and the back to get nothing. It was a little nervracking at first at the pool because the 'non-americans' frightened me. I soon got over it.</P>
<P>I went to Stac's new place on Saturday night where I met the love of her life,Dave, and two of his friends, the Giant (aka Ken"") and the guy w/the glasses...forget his name,oops. Her cousins Steve &amp; Mark came over along with Mark's friend and his fiance'. And then Joe, Gino &amp; Erica came over. I then left at 12 due to....certain things that do not need to be discussed. </P>
<P>Sunday dad&nbsp; &amp; I went shopping and I got some clothes for work and some not for work, yea! Visited mom afterwards &amp; brought her Clio. Now Abby is weird....it is hard to tell if she is either happy to be alone again or missing the annoying presence of Clio. One may never know. Today I went to dad's for dinner , get my plate back, allen wrenches and another tool to take apart the day bed. Hasta La Vista bed. Mom may want it but she don't know...I think it would be a wise choice, but what do I know?</P>
<P>Now I'm sitting here thinking about the work I have to do tomorrow after work taking apart the bed and cleaning 'ferretness'. They are so sweet but they are shit monsters. I love them anyways! I have to steam clean the carpet in here, due to cats not ferrets, and the carpet in the living room from dogness. I miss dogness :( His nose prints are still on my patio door...how sad is that to have it still there after a month of him being gone? :( I love you Hercules, where ever you may be.</P>
<P>Anyways, I gotst ta go. Time for some TV and play time with my pets. </P>

There is no safe, secure way on telling someone what's up when you have no clue how they feel and you do not want it to ruin what friendship there is. Trust me. If you know of an idea, please tell me about it! I'm believe I am falling for someone I do not even know that well, more or less would picture myself with him.

<P>Saturday night was fun. Went to Jon's with Stacey. Got some beads, got some alcohol, bounced on the trampoline, sprained my ankle. The usual. I fell going out side at his house and sprained/twisted my ankle. Anyways, it feels better today. Woke up Sunday with pain an pajamas that were on inside-out. Which is funny, because I do not even remember putting them on...kinda freaky.</P>
<P>My mom called me today to tell me my Grandma went in to the hospital and she might have a blood infection and that my mom,herself, is not feeling to hot and she is going to the Dr. tomorrow. It never ends, it is never just one thing at a time. I guess I should be use to it by now.</P>

I bought the Southbeach Diet book and cookbook yesterday after work and I plan to advise by them pretty damn good. So then I will be thin again and not be freaked out every day about certain things. There was something that I wanted to say and now I do not remember...I hate my short term memory loss. Another day without Treil, here at Acura of Troy, so that means we all have to work harder to make up for his lack of presence. Last night when I was at Target, Jon's friend, Brad, gave me his number so we can hang out or do something of the sorts. I don't know what I will say though, I guess you could say I'm nervous? I mean, I get nervous calling Stac all the time-haha! So we will see about that sometime or another. I text messaged Stac this morning asking if she wanted to go to the zoo on Saturday, and it is Earth Day Saturday so they will have ""eco-friendly crafts"", and her reply was ""fuck yeah"". I thought that was a rather nice way of saying ""Yes, I'd love to"". So be it. To the zoo we will meander. I went two summers ago with the ex- and I have some pictures from that. But....ugh, anyways. So I have to make sure I charge my batteries for my camera so I can take pictures of every animal I see. I really hope I get to stick my head in the underground bubble thing where the prairie dogs are, that would be splendid. And I have to make sure someone takes a pic of Stac and I there too, good times. Did you know you can adopt an animal there? I think I may just do that for $40.....I'm sure the proceeds go towards the animals and their living arrangments and what not. I will update everyone after we go so no one misses out on anything

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>i had a nice weekend, not that i usually dont, but it was cool. friday night&nbsp;i was at stacs with some people and we all just hung out and do whatever it is we do. saturday i got a make-up makeover, which turned out pretty sweet. i was impressed because i did not look all fake, but i looked a tad different then what i usually do. that night stacey and i went to canada, the first time for both of us going without someone who knows where to go, and we had some road trip fun trying to find places. but it worked out good cause we found bentleys and the beach bar &amp; grill. the beach sucked. we were there&nbsp; for like an hour and some guy who works there wanted to take our chairs. well i should not say wanted, because he succeeded at taking them. after i told him that we had gotten then first and that we would like to sit for five more minutes. so, he obliged and let us have our last five minutes on the stools.&nbsp; after that we went back to bentleys for one more drink or two and when we got in my car...WALA.....there it was. a parking ticket under my drivers side wiper. i was most offended and appalled and my outlook on canada changed within the blink of an eye. $40 for what?! sign did not say no parking....i still do not understand how i got the ticket and what the sign was trying to tell me, but lucky for me the cops in canada are dumb. the 'officer' wrote down the wrong license plate number. instead of a V he typed in a Y. maybe he was somewhat tipsy himself, i will never know. but since he wrote down the wrong number, did not have my drivers license #, my info or vehicle #, i got away with it! so no paying canada $40 cause the cop screwed up. so that was awesome after staring at the ticket for about fifteen minutes and finally realizing the error! sunday was the usual running around, doing errands, cleaning day. i spent the last four hours of my sunday evening watching 'cheaper by the dozen', with steve martin and then desperate housewives until 10pm.i slept like a baby last night and unfortunately found it rough to get up this morning for work. but i did , of course, make it there on time, bright eyed and bushy tailed. </P>
<P>as for every other aspect of my life, things seem to be moving slowly. i decided being alone is not so bad, but being with someone is not all the bad either. but i have yet to hear my heart actually want to commit to anything or anyone. the time will come eventually, and when it does i will know. for now, i take it all one day at a time and i am loving it.</P>"

"event","i am happy because ER is on tomorrow and it has not been on the last two weeks so that means only good things can come of this. tomorrow is st. patricks day so i guess i am suppose to go out and drink, but i dotn feel like it cause, well right now i feel crappy, and ER is on. and i only watch one show a week for one hour and im a nerd cause thats what i want to do. but i am okay with that. i havent drank since saturday and that is a good thing. although i usually have a beer or two with ER. i am sad to say that Bekah and I have yet to hang out! We talk about all the time...but we never act on it? i dont know... we are weird like that. i dont really feel like cleaning this room right now...my back is still kind of sore from sunday. speaking of sunday....i went to lunch with mom and tom, then we visited grandma and it was sad. she had dementia and it is sad when she doesnt remember you more or less know who you are. she kept thinking tom was a girl, cause of his long hair, and did not know he was my brother. she asked em like 5 times if i was married yet and then when i said no she asked why! i love her though. she is cute. so then i went to my moms old house with her to get my graduation gown and prom dress and her basement flooded again. it was no good. so i spent two hours there plunging the drains and squeeging the floors and the carpet...carpet does not squeegie so well....im not kidding when i say there was at least 1 inch of standing water on the floor and carpet and 2 inches in other places.....i felt bad for mom. water is no fun. my socks and shoes and pants were soppign wet and i was squishing in my shoes and then my feet itched. so i decided it was time to go, plus i squeegied all i could. igot my pictures developed from when i went to NC w/curt ans his family in August and i could of sworn i took so many other pictures then what i had on my camera. but i guess not because they developed all that was on there. i was sad because i thought there were more pictures not because of the pictures i saw. anyways....i am done here cause i dont have much else to say.  so good bye for now"

"event","<P>so last night started out fine. stac and i were hanging out drinking and then her cousin came over and then other people came over...misty,kyle, will and chris and it was a normal saturday night, right? we were all hanging out doing whatever and talking and then it was like maybe 2am and this guy brian ,this i knew from before when stac and i hung out, came over with two of his friends and some weird apple machine thing. and we were talking and they stayed for like half hour to an hour and left. and then stac left cause she had to do something and steve already went home quite some time ago cause he was a little not in the partying mood anymore. and then will started asking me lots of questions that i didnt have answers to because im not the person that knew the answers. and chris was just sitting there listening and doing what he does and then kyle got up and freaked out and was like ""im fucking leaving"" or something like that. there was so much talking going on a once i kinda spaced out for a second and then kyle was gone. and then he came back like a minute later and was pissed and left again. and i was jut freaking out and confused and waaaaaaaay trashed. and then will and chris left and i passed out. thats pretty much all i can remember. i dont remember any conversations that were had or anything that was done and i dont know why kyle flipped. and im to afraid to call cause&nbsp;i dont want to bother him and i just want to know what the hell happened. i dont know anything! i was to drunk and to out of it to do or say to much. i only remember bits and pieces of last night. so if i did or said something bad i apologize. but i dont even know what the hell happened! it all happened to fast. it was bad times at the end....i just wish i knew what went on so&nbsp;i could know and know if i should be sorry and if so what the fuck about! GOSH!</P>

but then i turn down the heat a notch and im freezing. just dont get it
im kind of bored right now so im just going to babble on about nothing in particular
i went to wow to return their cable box so they will stop sending me a $40 bill
but of course it is saturday
and they are closed on weekends
what assholes
so then i went to best buy to see if they could like fix my phone or i could get a new one
no such luck
they said i would have to go to a cingular outlet and maybe they could finagle (?)
something with the manufacturer warranty
but i didnt want to mess around with that and then i would most likely have to send my phone out
and not have a phone for so many weeks and that is my only means of communication
so that no good
so i ended up back at home and watched some tv and i ate some nachos for brunch and then i had 
some rainbow sherbert
but i need to eat something sufficient
and i dont feel like reheating the lasagna right now so im not sure what to do
i feel like putting my hair in pigtails but i doubt i will cause im to lazy to do that too
i really should go to the gym....but i dont see that happening either
GOSH
and i should get all my paychecks in order .....actually...that's not so hard...so maybe i will

"event","i decided im not going to capitalize letters unless i really have to. everyone will know what i mean anyways whether or not if i use them. it just takes up more typing time. i am sad i did not get to go out and eat with becca and her friend. i assume they have been talking alot about the things they should talk about. like blue ponies and hot dog flavored soda. or so that's what i heard they talk about. i am quite confused at the moment cause i have lots of thoughts going on in my head and i am debating on whether or not i should eat some dinner before the movies. i believe that if i starve myself and eat only movie theatre popcorn that it will not be  a sufficient enough dinner and i will still be forever hungry. but on the other hand i do not know what to make. s'getti or joe's that are sloppy? i hate to make decisions cause im so crappy at it. on my way home today i stopped at oakland to get a orange julius cause i was somewhat thirsted and hungered and it sounded really good. the mall was a complete place of busyness. there was some wrestling people there or something about wrestling going on? the only reason  know is cause steve told me about it yesterday and how he wanted to go back today for fun. i dont know about that... i got up at like 9:10, it was late and bad! and then i had to go to k-mart where i found out they
dont sell cheeze wizz there so now i can not make broccoli  :-(  i have to have cheese with my broccoli because there is not any other way to eat it. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....
anywaysm, from k-mart i went to moms where i packed the rest of everything up and then we went to aunt dorothees and they to the storage unit. from there she went back to aunt dorothees and i proceeded to her house to get some things i couldnt fit in my car earlier and then to the mall and then to home. needless to say this was a pretty busy day for me because i planned on doing nothing today! but you do what you gotta do to help a 'motha' out.  that was stupid but it is ok. 
abby has been crying uncontrollably since ibrought her here. last night was worse then today though. today she played with moby and ollie or more or less they got to chase her. she is ok now. i just feel so bad when she cries cause i dont know what she wants. oliver decided to snorkel in the cat box in the bathroom after abby pee'd in there and then he got litter all up in his nose and on his face. so i had to wipe off his face and make him blow his nose to get the litter out of there and what not. i was pissed and disgusted. blowing a ferrets nose is a little awkward if you know what i mean esp. hen he was squiggling like a maniac cause he HATES to be held. ( i had to capitalize that for better emphasis) 
tomorrow is back to work and then i get to do it all over again. sometimes i think jon lies to me and makes me go out two or three times in a row to help a customer cause he says he 'got the last one'. i think tomorrow i will just keep going out for every customer that comes in so i can ...well i dont know what i will do..but yea....
i should go now. i think i decided on s'getti cause it isnt to much work besides the garlic bread.

hold your head up high for tomorrow will make you stronger

i dont know where that came from or that it even makes sense
i think i am going to add a dif. photo for my ID thingy...i want to put a photo in here but not sure how...damn"

<P>eat until so late tonight. I have to go grab Hercules, go to mom's, grab Clio and then go to Stac's so she can live there for a while.</P>
<P>And then bring Abigail back to my house, yea, but not really yea, so that she can live there. And then maybe finally get some food to</P>
<P>eat. I am forever bored and tired at the moment. And really hungry.... maybe I can eat some fruitsnacks on the way to mom's. She has </P>
<P>paczki's but we will not eat those until after I'm almost sure. Kyle, he made me mad and sad yesterday because he was being mean even</P>
<P>though he said he was joking. I don't know about that. So I told him I would call him next week when he will hopefully be in a better</P>
<P>mood so I do not have to hang up on him and make him sad!&nbsp; Hmph!&nbsp; My ankle bone thingy is bruised for sure because I can not</P>
<P>sit on it or touch it or put any weight on it. Someone must of kicked me while I had drank to much so I do not remember this</P>
<P>occurence. If I ever find out who did it....their ass is grass. Jeff just laughed at me for keeping a live journal. Well&nbsp; HA HA HA </P>
<P>HA HA HA HA HA HA HA&nbsp; I am laughing at you Jeff. ""Oh, you talk to his son? What do you talk about? What kind of friends?</P>
<P>What kind of graduating did you do?"" Those would be questions of Jeff asked me about Greg Jr. What a goofball. </P>
<P>So much for that....I think there might be a ""Trefil Pool"" game. It is to see if he will be late to work anymore this week, and if so</P>
<P>what days and how late will he be. But Jeff rendered up another game. His game is....for the next month both he &amp; Trefil have</P>
<P>to be on time to work, if not earlier then they should be. Whoever makes it in late loses their job. To me, thats a pretty</P>
<P>sufficient game. Greg said it will not even last a whole week...so we will have a new porter on Monday-ha ha .&nbsp; I feel bad</P>
<P>for Abby cause she will be saddened by the fact that she will no longer be an outdoors cat unless she is chained up on my</P>
<P>balcony so she can not fall through the railing three floors down and go 'bye-bye'. Oh well, you live and you learn. </P>
<P>Sometimes...well scratch that thought. Today was not so bad of a day besides the fact I learned that Mr. Miller firewalled</P>
<P>yahoo.com from me. I guess because I checked my mail on it and you are not allowed to. That is the only thing I can think of.</P>
<P>It is sad, but oh well, I still have dogpile and google available for use. GOD! My nose is soo fricken itchy. I'm getting kind of mad.</P>
<P>Jon is really loud...sometimes I wonder about him....quite a person is what I will say. Steve called me last night and I was glad</P>
<P>but freaked cause I called him twice Saturday night and he was suppose to come over but he did not because he was too drunk</P>
<P>and having sex or something? Anyways his message was a little something like this ""Hey Jennie, it's Steve. Sorry about Saturday but I was</P>
<P>really drunk and having fun so I could not talk. Anyways I'm calling you back now, but you don't have to call me back tonight. Call</P>
<P>me tomorrow, not tonight, OK? Bye"". Hmmm...so perhaps I shall call him....maybe....since it is tomorrow and I can. </P>
<P>Anyways, I've been talking for like 15minutes nonstop now so I'm about to go. Get to leave in 15minutes yeaa!!! Plus my fingers</P>
<P>are killing from typing. goodbye</P>

"event","Somebody told me that you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year. I saw Hide & Seek last night with Gino, Stac, Kyle & Will. I enjoyed it, but Will (as usual) fell asleep, Kyle is picky(?) and said it sucked. But Stac & Gino liked it? Or so I think!  It was nice, but quite twisted. I wished Misty could of come and hung out. But she had to work at 6am and not 5am but she got up at 4:30 and it sad yet funny. And then this morning she called me at the exact same time that my alarm went off and there was a lot of static and crap from the phone being by my radio.  Kyle is pretty really cool. Even though he is mean sometimes!! But he pushes my cart for me at PETCO so that was nice. Stac & I went to the mall so I could get something for Misty for her 23rd Birthday on Thursday, yeaa! And then we had a Mrs. Fields cookie and a smoothie from Surf City. Lakeside mall is sooooo confusing. I have not been there in a long time, and I did not know where anything was. Then the directory said there was a Day by Day Calendar Co. but there wasn't. So it lied to us and I was sad and couldn't get a desk calendar for my desk at work. Maybe there is one at Oakland still..I do not know, if not I will never be able to have a calendar for work and then I will never know what day it is and I will be sad about it.  
So I'm just talking to Becca and we are going to go out to eat sometime this week so I can meet someone she knows. I haven't seen her in a long time so it will be good. I'm getting ready to go to my dads soon for ribs and other food that he made. This will be good too. I do not know what else to say. Not much else. Got some things I got to take care of now so I am leaving. Bye"

"event","Okay...please forgive me father for i have sinned...it has been 20 years, 6 months and 3days since my last confession...
 I apologize for not writing in here as often as i should be...time just seems to fly out the window like the way a squirrel flees for its life from Hercules. 
My life has been pretty good the past 3-4 weeks. No real complaints about living on my own. Was a tad strange at first, but now I have furniture, and cable and the internet and the 'boys' to keep me occupied so I go to bed pretty wiped out. I must say, it is different being so quiet all the time. Except for the occasional growl or bark from Hercules because of people walking in the parking lot or Moby stealing his food and running from me and dodging under the bed. Sometimes I get a little lonely...on the weekend....oh my gosh! hold on..have to put my laundry in the 'community dryer'. Okay, I have returned. I really need to get my scarf back from Steve...I should call him to see if he has it or if it is at his parents. 
So Friday night Stacey came over, we went to high school together and were pretty good friends, and have known each other for like....11 years? But I had not seen her since graduation so it was quite nice. I was happy. Well, me and Stacey (I mean, Stacey and I-Josh Powell-BIO class, ha ha) we were in the ferret room talking about things and she was playing with them and we were in there for like 15min at most. Anyways, Kyle and Will were in the living room, and when we came out of the ferret room, they had left! I was pissed. They didn't say goodbye or anything. So Stacey started calling everyone from her cell phone that she knew to come over and I left Kyle like 10 ""I'm so pissed off"" messages. But then it was like 1:30am (kind of early) and we were so tired so we went to sleep. 
I woke up at 8 and woke up Stac to early, sorry Stac, and we watched Along Came Polly. Then Stac took a shower here and was completely freaked out cause I have no shampoo. I mean, I use it sometimes, not everyday because I like conditioner, and I ran out. So, no shampoo for me! Then we helped her cousin Steve move to his new apt. like 5 miles away from me and then I left at 4 to let Herc out. Misty came over later until about midnight cause we were both just way to tired to stay up, nonetheless talk too ne another. Then I got up at 8 today and visited my dad and then I went to my moms for like 6 hours. And we went out looking for this movie called ""The Devils Arithmetic"", it is like 6years old but no one had it. I guess it is not a 'huge seller', so no Best Buy, Target, Circuit City or F.Y.E. had it...but I found it on Overstock.com for like $12.37 w/S+H so that is good even though I really wanted to have it right now so I could watch it tonight. No luck though :(
And now here I am at 6 on Sunday debating whether I should make some dinner and call Kyle or Steve. I'm still a little mad/sad at Kyle for that, but he got me this candle holder that holds 3 candles that's really cute just like....so I guess I can accept his ""I was really drunk"" apology. This time only though. 
I am going to try and write more in my journal if I can remember...My nights just go by way to fast after I get home from work, grrr!
Ok, it is time for me to read other people's entries. Good bye for now cyber world."

"event","<P>Let me see...it has been some time since I have written in my journal...I'm definitely going to have to try and work on that. Anyways, good news do I have for all. I found an apartment in Troy that will let me have my big goofy black dog, Hercules, because he makes it at the 65lb and under weight restriction. So happy times for that, although for some reason every time I drive near the apartment&nbsp; I am to move into or even merely think of it, Ia wave of nervousness passes threw me. Unsure why...but this is true .Right now, something is being made for dinner, but I am unsure of what because all I can smell is the scent of burntness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Hmm...Thanksgiving was good times...I saw Greg for the first time in forever and it was nice of them to have me over. He will be home Thursday the 9th for like three weeks. So we will have to hang out and go to the womens strip club in Canada so I can see what exactly goes in those places...heh heh... I have not been to Canada in over a year now, and I hear it calling my name...wanting me to drink it's succulent alcoholic drinks...needing me to spend my lovely American dollars there on Canadian items. Mmmm.....</P>
<P>Last night I do not think I necessarily drank too much...just that I drank to fast. So we ended up watching Along Came Polly with Rodolfo the blind ferret ( who is awesome! ) FYI....there is the <EM>most annoying </EM>fly flying around my room, he will not die, he will not leave, he will not sit still but he will continue to fly until he has decided he is done. I just want to smoosh the f***er!&nbsp; Anyways, so the twisted raspberry Smirnoff was a good idea. I got home near 2am pretty crap faced, passed the hell out as soon as my body touched the bed and woke up to the time of 10:45am! Needless to say I was most furious with myself for sleeping so late. I literally had to drag my hung over ass into the shower and try to wake up. I felt like puking the first 3hours I was awake. That stopped, and here it is 5:30pm and I'm feeling like yacking again. WTF!&nbsp; I'll never understand this alcohol crap, only that it is good going down, but not coming up. Ha ha </P>
<P>So yea, I decided to sign up for Americansingles.com, free version only of course. I will not be nuts and pay for such nonsense at the cost of&nbsp; 25/month. That is $25 for gas, alcohol, food, alcohol or clothes! Besides that...I must go out to to the clubs and bars so I can find myself the bar boyfriend I am looking for. Not to much to ask for I think. Hmm...so that is where I stand relationship wise. As single as the last wheat pennies that are amidst us. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, I re-connected my SIRIUS radio to my car approximately 4 weeks ago but what have I listened to for the last 3 weeks I have been in my car?.Oh, EMINEM! Yeaa...he is my hero in someway or another. I can not help it....it is true. His songs hold so much truth and honesty to them. And his emotions are so strong in his words. How can you not like him? Unless you are Jon who believes Eminem is like the devil, or so he should be. But Jon is a crazy guy who listens to....?? country?? Good question there...I must ask Jon on Monday what music he likes.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Well, for now I must go and find that god damned fly that is making me nuts...find out what the food is for the night....put clothes away and my least favorite....putting sheets on the bed....ugh</P>
<P>Good bye for now, the homewrecker will return....!</P>"

Friday I was a at Misty's w/Steve and these other people that Misty works with and we ended up crashing for the night. Went to bed about 3am and got up at 9am. Went home, showered, got my nails did, went to Taco Bell, washed the car and dried it with a 75cent shammy from the local vending machine. Went to the movies and saw 'SAW', which happened to be pretty cool yet definitely not enough shown gore and guts for me. They always turn the camera away at the good parts. After that went to Steve's with Gino, Chris. Scott and Darin. Did the same shit and ended up going to sleep about 3 or 3:30am since my mother and I stayed up waiting for the bro to come home yet he never showed. Goot up at 9am again, bro came home finally, that was a whole other fiascal. Went to dads for the DVD player, went to Twelve Oaks mall bought new jeans, shoes and earrings-yea! Went back home, at pizza, passed out candy to the little goblins and ghouls, put away clothes for work, text messaged for like an hour or two went to sleep 'bout 11 or midnight, got up at 6am and here i am 6hours and 40 minutes later. I don't know what to do and there isn't much I can do just yet. Anyways, all I have to say for now and ummmm........bbbbyyyyeeee</P>

"event","<P>well the last time i was here was the twelfth (sp?) of september. my internet and tv has been off for a week due to last months unpaid bill. but since i paid it last night they decided to reconnect me, yea! lol</P>
<P>&nbsp;i finally organized all the piles of trash on my desk so i can actually see the top of it and see what it looks like. doesnt look to special unfortunately!&nbsp; my throat hurts for some reason. i dont know if it is from the cigar from last night or from puking cause i got trashed. its one or the other because i can not be sick! i will be so mad. it is to early in the season for sickness.&nbsp; so tomorrow i am going to go to church thats on the chrysler drive somewhere with bekah from mervyns. she use to work there too but now she is jusr at JVS. i havent seen her for a long time so it will be nice. after service is over i am going to the cider mill with my mom to walk the path and eat cider, donuts and caramel apples! mmmmm..........&nbsp; i love to just walk down the path there because sometimes you can see cool little wood animals scurrying about. </P>
<P>and then it is back to work monday until friday and then i think i am going bowling with the cousins and their friends friday and then to frankenmuth on saturday. i will have to double check on that though to see if it is still on. i wish i had some beer to make my throat feel better. even though it most likely wont...i just want some.&nbsp; i was going to go alone tomorrow to the mill but i figured i can do that next week or something. </P>
<P>sorry to everyone, i never have anything to important or meaningful to say. i just like to blab to no one!&nbsp; i thought on saturdays that 93.1 was club music. i guess they changed cuz they feel the need to play commercials all the friggen time! i decided that hopefully i will re connect to sirius cuz i miss the commercial free music! and the awesome dance music they play. 'tis pretty cool. i will go to the sirius website soon and get the # to connect! i think they r still open this late. all 800 numbers usually are.</P>
<P>it is quite chilly outside now...fall is officially here. nah. i hate coldness. cuz i have to bundle up and esp. keep my hands and wrists warm so my blood will still flow through my unusually narrow veins. and then probably have to get put back on high blood pressure medication so my veins will open and allow the blood to flow. </P>
<P>thankfully my computer is ok from last night. i accidently spilled beer on it. well not directly on it, but onto the desk which then started to flow onto the floor like a waterfall. i then grabbd a towel and soaked up the carpet smelling beer. ( not that my carpet smells bad, it is just dirty)</P>
<P>but&nbsp;i am going to go to sirius now,&nbsp; so goodbye</P>

"event","<P>everyday, or every other day, whenever time allows,, i come to use my computer and gaze upon the spill of bills, letters, paystubs, work schedules, receipts and more. it is mostly organized into each of their own piles. but after a while the piles mold into one another and now it is a large pile of miscellaneous papers. i mean to put it away...i just dont want to re-group the papers and throw out the ones that are way old and un-needed cause....well i just dont want to do that much work yet! hah</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>do you know what is annoying? when you call someone and they dont answer their phone, and then you call a hour later when you <EM>know </EM>they have it and still dont answer?! and they dont check their messages either and their excuse is ""oh my phone ws in the truck, oh it was charging in the truck, oh i didnt feel it go off (vibrate mood), oh i was busy carrying stuff"" yada yada. you know, the usual BS. sometimes if you call like once a minute they either answer or they shut the phone off. if they shut the phone off then you know for sure they are avoiding you for some godly unknown reason. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>for some reason kazaa wont d/l evanescence 'my immortal'. hmmm...it must be in one of those moods for alll their songs!&nbsp; i really want to drink some beer so i can get carazy and watch passion of the christ. i saw it at the theatres but i keep seeing the previews cause it is out on dvd and need to see it again! i think i might go buy it....but my dad gave me money that is to be used until sept 22nd. so i have to be careful how i use it. ( yea my dad gave me dinero cause im a cheap beeatch) but that soon will all change!&nbsp; so i have to check the wallet to see how much will be left for the next 9 days. if notl enough, well..i will have to wait until sept 22nd to get the movie. so i can watch it on the 24th. so here i go to check the financial situation is. talk to you all later, bye.</P>"

"event","<P>&nbsp;where were you when those goddamned terrorists killed hundreds of innocent <EM>americans</EM>? i know where i was. i was in cpc, early child development, watching the tv because class was almost over and the little ones were not there. i practically crapped myself and then cried. i rushed home before the bell rang to watch tv with my mom and call my dad to tell him to be careful because stupid <EM>non-americans</EM> just destroyed the WTC and the pentagon and that he should stay away from big things and tall buildings. but,....i could not call him because i guess my cell phone tower was connected to NYC and it would not work. i was frantic. i called and called on my house phone to talk to him and finally on like the 8th try he received the call. so i told him all the crap that was going on and yadda, yadda. and then i tried to eat but was to freakin out so i went back to sterling where i hoped we could watch the news but we had to bake for our schedule to remain on time and all the chaldos were freakin out sayin they were goin back home (iraq, iran, etc) i wish they would of because we are now blowing their asses up and they would be dead! stay in your own freakin country. america is diddy w/o you all. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>anyways. it is for sure that my title is ""service advisor"" yea! and i start sep 20th and im a little nervous. but i will be makin mucho bucks and could make <U>up to </U>$730 in one week! that would be like a whole months paycheck at the mervyns. and i get paid every week and not every other.yea-ness for me.&nbsp; wish me luck everyone!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;on the bad note, my poor white wigger moby has ear mites :( my mom and her bf took him to see dr. havas friday. and he got a cortizone shot :(, blood taken :( and ear medicine :)&nbsp; (it is just like squeezed into his ear so that is a good thing!) we only hope oliver beans has nothing wrong with his ears but we are giving him some meds too, because you never know. and herc got his own new treatment too because he is a huge freak with huge loppy ears that get infected too! damn dirty ear animals!! but i love them. too cute. well, thank god mobes for lobes' ear will be well soon. i only hope nothing bad come s back from the blood test like AD :( thyroids gone nuts. my baby dont need that. i might have to move back to the mothers house if this crap keeps up here longer about having no animals here. i guess divorced crazy twin bitches are not understanding.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;i got to go people. this has been alot for me to write and im debating if i should start drinking yet, heh heh&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

"event","well it seems as though my friendship definition is not what everyone else' is. sorry. i have friends that i dont see alot and thats because time does not allow and when i do have time i like to spend it with myself or my boyfriend that i live with that i see a total of like three hours a week. plus trying to get a higher position at work plus other things. im sorry i dont like to talk on the phone for a long time and that i dont answer my messages a.s.a.p. i told rob the other day when he called i didnt call him back wed cuz he didnt leave a message. sue me!!&nbsp;&nbsp; anyways i have way to much stuff to figure out then to argue about things and what not. im not someone that likes to talk on the phone alot, hang out for long times, not do anything, not work, and step in ferret poopies! (which i did about 3min ago) i wonder why kristina wont write in her journal ?!?! i wonder why american silver bullets are cheaper than canadian cans? i wonder why they are shaped funny so they dont fit correctly in another type of box besides the one they came in? i wonder why my calendars still say june? i wonder why i have had two weekends off in a row? i wonder why i havent been back to walmart to return my trampoline? i wonder why lanlord thinks i will sue her if i fall off my OWN trampoline? i wonder why tanning lotion smells so funny? i wonder why mostly only asian/chinese/japanese/vietnamese people do nails and not americans or ...? ( i wont say ) i wonder why mobo thinks the whole floor is a toilet? i wonder why mobo jumps into the bathroom garbage and tries to nap in there? i wonder why ollie beans thinks its funny to poop in the tub when i give him a bath? i wonder why hercules sneaks onto the bed when we are gone and sleeps and gets everything hairy?&nbsp; do you know the answer to any of these? if so reply back and tell me why this is all so. and i wonder why curt garbage picked a old tv in a boxy entertainment center thing that probably doesnt work? i wonder how my nail broke in my sleep and now my finger feels broken?"

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;Anyways I'm resting now because my ""<EM>pies""</EM> are sore and need to relax.Tonight is spaghetti night because it is fast and simple. Just because people call me does not mean I always call back that day or the day after. Sometimes I just don't want to talk or am busy or working. I don't live by my phone, and I usually answer it one out of every two calls. Why? Because sometimes I'm lazy and sometimes I'm not! SORRY. Usually between 9-10 at night is a good time to talk and any time on weekends (unless i'm working) 'cause then it is free and I'm cheap. hah. So that is my synapose' on why I don't call back. I'm a busy girl and there is always something that needs to be cleaned, bought or straightened up. So sorry to those I don't call back a.s.a.p.&nbsp; I'm just not&nbsp;into chit chattin for long times on the phone. Anyways gotta go clean up the&nbsp;disaster my ferrets made.&nbsp;bye&nbsp;</P>"

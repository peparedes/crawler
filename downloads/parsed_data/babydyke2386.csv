"event","So on Monday I decided I wanted to go to Miami. My friend Nicki was already down there..by herself for some reason, so on Tuesday I jumped on a plane..for the first time, all by myself, and went to Miami.I just got back today, it was a pretty good time, would have been better if I was rich and 21, but oh well, it was a good experience. 

I havent talked about this girl lately cuz, i was sure i was over her but, apparently not. who was i foolin. its really pissing me off though, i dont even talk to her at all anymore but i still cant stop thinking about her, and shes just going on with her life which really pisses me off. i just wish she could see what im going through but she wouldnt understand, she never understood anything i said anyways and she never tried. Blah..she sucks. Actually no, she doesnt suck at all, shes amazing, and beautiful and i want her soooooo bad."

"event","Last night was awesome!! I went to Gallagher's to see my friend perform in a show. The second I walk through the door i feel someone staring me down, so i look up and this girl is just staring my ass down. So she did this for about 15mins until her friend came over to me and told me that she was very curious about me, so we ended up talking. After Gallaghers closed, around 2, we(me, Beth, Nicki, and Dennis) went to another club called 1722 which was a lot of fun too. We stayed there until about 4, then went to Denny's, then we rented a hotel room. It was an awesome night. I'm so exhausted now, ill probably be taking a nap soon since i only slept about 3 hours."

"event","Well it turned out to be a great day...i think it was because i was being social today, i actually went out. So I went to work, which was great, i was in an awesome mood all night. Then around 10:30 i went over to Alyssa's to watch EuroTrip..it was pretty funny. I had a brownie and some wine..yummy wine. Now im home, i should go to bed, but im waiting for my night to get better..how? by talkin to Laura, but shes a wild party girl and likes to stay out until 3a.m. So no, my night wont be perfect, but its close enough. I hope i have more days like this."

"event","This is crazy, I started the day off saying it was going to be shitty, but so far its been great. I went to class today from 935-1130. I got out of my second class about an hour early, then i decided not to go to my boring lecture class. So after class I went to Jeremy's and we watched a movie. My friend Chris called me, who i havent seen in forever, and asked me if i wanted to go to the mall with her, robin, and matt to meet her girlfriend for lunch. Then after lunch i went to Starbucks and got a caramel machiato, which is very good. So i've had a great day so far, but i still have to go to work. so we'll see.."

"event","I'm not out to everyone yet, not even my good friend Jeremy. So my friend Fig and I are sitting on the bench and Jeremy is standing in front of us, and he's like ""God damn, thats the sexiest girl I''ve seen on campus so far"", Fig and I both practically break out necks turning around so fast...it was funny. Then jeremy was like...haha you both turned around so damn fast. So maybe he knows I'm gay now. I really should just come out to him, I'm getting tired of hiding it. Well I thought I'd share that with everyone because i thought it was funny. Oh and yea...she definately was the hottest girl any of us has seen on campus yet."

"event","Whenever it rains I usually have a shitty day. Even though i was having a shitty day before i even woke up this morning. I have an exam today that im probably going to fail.

I wish I would've done things differently, I've definately made an ass out of myself for this past month(well since i got back home). Oh well, its what i do best, fuck things up, by being a dumbass. Well im done being a dumbass, i promise. Even though its too late now. I wish i could start all over again. 

I'm so jealous of everyone who gets to see her and hang out with her everyday."

"event","Well i think I'm a very happy person overall, but i just go through these phases where i get depressed, i think a lot of people do. So i guess ill share with whoever reads this, the things that make me happy. Being at work puts me in a good mood, for the most part, yea i dont like working, but i love the people i work with and they always make me smile. Going to school sometimes makes me happy because i feel like im accomplishing something, but when i find out i lost 50points for whatever, that pissed me off, o well. Then theres laura, whether shes knows it or not, she makes me very very happy, and not many people can do that. I dont even have to talk to her, just thinkin about her makes me smile. alright im done."

"event","Its a Saturday night and im sitting at home online. I'm such a loser! Dont try to tell me otherwise because its the truth. I have no friends. So i need to make some friends, which i dont see me doing because i go to a school where i know everyone already, or if they dont know u, they dont wanna know u. So i guess ill be a loser for the rest of my life. fun. I'm glad i have so much to look forward to. Well i guess im just gonna go to bed at 11 on a saturday night."

"event","So I haven't written in a long time, but nothing really has been going on. Besides the usual bad luck with girls. Maybe I should just pretend I'm straight and date guys for now on. Nah, i wont go that far. I just have to try my best to be patient. Someday a girl will come around, or maybe she already has, but shes hard to get. I'm willing to fight for her though, and I wont give up. So about this girl...wow, shes amazingly beautiful, intelligent, funny, sexy...everything anyone would want. So of course I have a lot of competition..very strong competition. Maybe I am the one she wants. I guess i just have to wait it out until shes ready. I'm definately going to wait for that time, its goin to be worth it.
What people dont understand about me: Past relationships I've been in turned me into a jealous, self-concious person...which sucks, i try my hardest not to be like that but i cant help it. I just always want to be prepared for the worst, I dont want to be suprised that someone doesnt want me. I try to stay calm, cool, and collected."

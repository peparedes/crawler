I am all better now and am going to school tommorow.  I have a feeling that it won't be much fun due to at least three things.

It was hellzma ghetto down there, tons of mud to get thrown in your face while pushing cars out of it, Medical clinic look all pretty now.  People down there are alot nicer on a wider scale.  A few were assholes but thats to be expected.  They had tons of food and sodas that aren't sold in the US  Like real nacho flavored dorritoes and glass bottle sprites.  Yum.  The Padre down there was one of the true christians and he rocked.  I find many things up here uninteresting now and I crave for something new.  I fell out of love with that gal and came close to hating everyone in my class a couple of times.  One example.  On wednsday I think three people get sick.  We all curl up in our sleeping bags at around 4.  At 5 one person has around 10 people huddled around him trying to make him feel better, I get sporatic visits from the teach with drugs, cal with tea and miya with a blanket.  The third person didn't have any of that to thebest of my knoledge.  It made me feel like over reacting and doing self destructive things.  YES!  I will make my life harder!  THAT WILL SHOW THEM!  I get very strange when I'm mad.  Anywhoo, I'm off my normal sleeping patterns and I want back on!  I went to bed at 10 and woke up at 7!  I need tons of caffiene.  NOW."

A day without a mexican, full metal jacket, je-un (i think thats what it's called), and shaun of the dead.  When we came back I watched shaun and it was good.  I then ate food, and my aunt and mom wanted to watch shaun so I watched it again.  In the morning I was made to go with him and his friend to get a new video card for their computers.  That was fun.  We then came back and spent much time trying to get the video card to work, when it didn't we went out, got burritos, and watched ""A day without a Mexican"".  Good stuff.  We then spent another 2 hours working on the video card.  Then they opened presents and I played another 15 minutes of HL:2.  On the way home my mom started telling me how video games were destroying my life and such.  Other than that nothing happened."

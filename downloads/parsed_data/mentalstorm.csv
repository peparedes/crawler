You are a thinker.  You appreciate time with others<br>and time alone, but often have a preference for<br>the latter.  You think ahead and prepare<br>yourself for whatever surprises may come your<br>way.  You are dependable and loyal, and have no<br>issues with committment.

"event","Due to the nature of my job, I feel it is necessary to restrict my journal to friends only.  If you feel you should be on my friends list, leave a comment.

Don't be offended if you are not accepted as a 'friend'.  I interact with thousands of gamers a day, some on more personal levels than others, and while I love you all, that doesn't mean I feel close enough to you all to give insight into my personal life.  I must maintain personal 'distance' to retain my professionalism when dealing with anyone other than *very* close friends.

If you add me to your own friends list, I will of course visit your journal and comment when appropriate :)  While I can't give you all access to MY journal, I'm interested in yours :)"

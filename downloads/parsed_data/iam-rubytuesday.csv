For me to move....yet again, I really seem to be making this a pattern in my life. Always on the go. I'm sad to leave my little apartment and my new friends. I am, however, excited to have a new apartment and new friends. It's a lonely nomadic existence I lead. 
I'm dating a boy. He lives far away. I like him. alot. I don't ever talk about it. I like it that way. So when we break up...it won't be a big messy affair =) I'm kidding...sort of..I guess. I don't know.
Moving is hard. It's not like I can just be like ""oh yeah I'll come look at the apartment this afternoon."" I actually have to plan out a day to drive my ass to Seattle to look around and with the rain and crap I'm not liking it one bit. Plus money is super super tight and I only have 3 weeks to figure it all out. Slightly stressed out. Ciao"

Strange the way I feel lately. 
Empty I guess. But not empty the way you may be thinking.
Not empty as in void, like something is missing. 
Just missing feelings of want and angst and desire.
maybe satisfied???
Maybe Sunyata?
Calm.
balanced.
Boring even.
Anyways going out with Anika tonight. Can't wait. Should be fun.
I got my new tattoo started, can't wait to get it finished.

thats enough. My attention span is too short right now

"event","You know, dating someone has really made me come to the conclusion that I ENJOY being single. And I don't view being single as the absence of a mate. I really truly enjoy being by myself. I don't feel the need to cuddle or have a deep connection or allow someone to make me happy. I am doing all these things just fine on my own. Since I have been single, everything in my life has improved. The quality of my friendships, my relationship with myself, my self esteem. I feel more whole, more complete being single than I have ever felt with any guy. EVER.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a heartless bitch who rolls her eyes at the idea of love. I've just really out grown the hopeless, all or nothing, stars in my eyes era. Love is something that is cultivated over a long long period of time. Definitely not in a week. So, I guess we'll be ""breaking up""
He's totally a forever kind of guy. And me, well, I'm just not.

I talked to Brandon the other day on his Birthday. It was so cute he was wasted and sentimental. oh I love those times. It will be nice to go home and see him again. Well not just him, everyone. You know, with out the dreaded funeral looming over our heads. This time, we'll laugh and drink, and go to the beach. And a REAL beach too. Not just a place where the ocean slams into a bunch of rocks. I am talking Hot sand, hot boys, beer, horseshoes. SUNSHINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I do love the cold, don't get me wrong, but I am ready to melt the thin layer of ice enveloping my bones.
I am ready to get my butt back in school. I have been here almost a year and the outta state taxed won't be an issue anymore. Then just a few more classes and I can get the hell outta Fred Meyer. The hell outta Bellingham and the hell outta Washington....No offense.
I cleaned my carpets today. It was pretty disgusting. No seriously. DISGUSTING.
anyways I'm gonna go enjoy whats left of the sunshine.
Annika, I miss you. We should hang out soon. ANd not starting at Midnight.

The one that makes it so hard to breathe. It's going to be an open casket funeral. That should be interesting and hard. You know I was flying here last night and I was lucky enough to have a window seat on my flight. I was looking out the window at teh stars and I just started crying. Let me tell you, you haven't seen the stars unless you've seen them from 35 thousand feet in the air. It was amazing and very appropriate. I am feeling very strange right now, so I'm gonna go and mourn.
BTW- it is soooooo sunny and warm and amazing. I miss this place.

So I like that guy. But I don't really want to see him. I guess I feel like if nothing happens with the relationship, nothing bad can happen. Hahaha what a dork. I dunno. I just like having this crush in my own mind. Then I can make it whatever I want it to be. I once had a long love affair with a guy I'd never met. I'm kidding.

Like if you actuall STOP and listen with just the intent of listening, instead of waiting to talk, you'll find you will be quite fulfilled. 
Bellingham is really starting to grow on me and I am really happy that I have moved up here. I think I have been approaching it with a more open mind since I have let go of LA. Thats the only way to move on ya know. Let go of whatever's holding you back.

Um, I hate liking people.It kinda freaks me out. But on the other hand it feels really good to know that I've not been permanently scarred from previous relationships and I can healthily move away from the past. Speaking of which. Seeing and hearing about other people going through break ups make me feel really proud of the way I have handled things. I Mourned, I cried, I got angry. I stayed chaste and I really allowed myself to feel the pain of the break up, and once that got old I started doing the next thing and probably the hardest thing of all...I let go. and Now I feel healthy and whole and all in all really good about myself. Cheers to the natural process of grieving. 
It's been a long time since I've been able to say this but I am really content with my life right now. I like where I am at, and I like that my happiness is not dependent on whether or not *my other half* is happy.I am good. all by myself....

Don't have much of a costume. Hopefully I can pull something together in the next 24 hours. Can't wait to see everyone all dressed up!!!!!!!!!! I bet you all will look soooo cute!"

"event","So, tonight I was going through one of my REALLY old Journals. I found this.
So young was I. *sigh* 


Finger nails are bleeding 
splintered wood fall in my eyes
I'm crying now, through the blood
throught he pain
trying
dying
lying when I say that I can do this
The air is becoming thick with lies
catacomb skies
buried with my favorite things
abuses 
excuses
reasons why I can't do this
panic sets in as I break through
fear 
anxiety
I may have to help myself
The ground opens up, the sky falls through
above, the things I'm most afraid of
oppurtunities, possibilities fall like rain
girls, boys, parents, bosses
responsibility, possibility
all the reasons I don't want to do this
oppurtunity swells and grows in velocity
I am safer under this umbrella of pain
I close my eyes
 I am at home
I hold my breath. 
count to ten
Plastic smile fades
laughter implodes
charm disipates
I crumble in on myslef
I told you from the start that
I couldn't do this"

"event","Punishing violence with violence is utterly futile and hypocritical. In doing so it internalizes violence throughout society. Conditioning it into all of our hearts. When we put people in prison, it should serve not only as a punishment, but as an oppurtunity for rebirth, for growth. When we return inmates back onto the streets, we should not return them as tense, angry, abused, resentful beings. They should be returned after being "" reformed"" and finding inner peace, spiritual understanding and self awareness. Only then has prison served any real purpose to mankind other than temporarily sheltering a ball of angry disturbed energy. Prisoners should be taught meditation and mindfullness, not be left to dwell in a spiritually barren hell. This will only continue to perpetuate the cycle of violence. Of course, mindfullness and self awareness cannot transform a criminal overnight; but it can furnish a crucial turning point with tools for understanding and transforming karma, detoxifying and leading a more peaceful life upon release.
And as for rapist and murders...well, let em rot! lol"

I'm almost completely unpacked, which is a record for me since last time I think it took me over a year to unpack completely, lol.  I've been assigned yard work which I did a lot of yesterday, but I woke up today without a voice and its gotten a bit too chilly for me to be outside if I'm developing a cold.  I hope that tomorrow I can finish it, then I'm supposed to head to my aunts and do some office work for her.

here is one example.

ysmay just spent 5 days at home for easter.  she spent the weekend before that in paris with her aunt.  the weekend before that she was in paris with her brother.  and the weekend before that her father was here.  and yet.  EVERY NIGHT she spends a good 2-3 hours on the phone with her family.  She got home last night from 5 days with her family, and then spoke to her mum on the phone for an hour and a half.   which would almost be okay if she had a decent voice, but she is SO LOUD and she screeches and sounds like a bad british drama.  Her dad emailed her today so she CALLED him to thank him for it and discuss what he wrote.  Norman Bates, anyone?

I am so glad that I am going away this weekend, and that everyone is disappearing over the holiday.  otherwise I am going to have to come up with reasons to be ""temporarily insane"" so I don't have to go to jail after I kiillllll heeerrrrrrrr"

"event","You know I have been following this story in the news for a while, and I think all the critics at harvard need to shove their heads up their asses and shut up.

If you don't know what I'm talking about, one of the gyms at Harvard recently introduced ""womens only"" hours after 6 Muslim women asked if it would be possible for hours to be set aside where they could exercize without men around so that they could dress comfortably.

An official spokesman at harvard said that ""this is america and they need to assimilate.""

I don't see what the big idea is.  Plenty of gyms exist that have womens only hours, rooms, or crap gyms themselves.  I think what the big huff is about is the fact that it was 6 Muslim women who requested it.  If it had been a bunch of Harvard cheerleaders saying they wanted hours because they were sick of guys staring at their tits as they ran there would be no problem with it, but since it is Muslims who requested it, this whole thing has turned into a giant media service.

I bet you that those hours are going to become incredibly popular at the gym, and these critics are going to have to take it all back.

I don't know why it makes me so mad, maybe because it's so blatantly racist.  or maybe I'm just so bored I have nothing to bitch about, but still."

It's been weird using it--I sometimes used Robs, but this one is smaller and just weeeiiiiiird.  Plus the edge is kind of sharp and is digging into my skin. WTF APPLE????

Today I spent all day cleaning.  I am officially unpacked from college! woohoo!!  The room is 98% done.  Just stuff to clean up, the rug to put down, and then it's just books and stuff that have been lazing around downstairs, nothing too horribly exciting.  I am excited to get used to this computer, though I am having to use help more than I really want to, lol.  I will forgive myself.

It's getting so laaaaaate.  It's almost the 20th!!  I leave in a little over a month. EEK.  I'm taking the GRE on sept 4, then I'm going to head out to Union to see Abbey and the girls at AlbanyMed.  I'll drop off a few recommendation forms, since I'm hoping that when I get back in December all I have to do is assemble my applications and mail them out.  Michelle will be in France with me, so I can just have her send them to me there.  Then Charles, and I don't know who I'll choose as a third.  I wonder if Veronique can do it...it's my teaching experience, after all.  We'll see.

I'm only applying to two grad schools this year--BC and BU.  BC is my #1.  They're the only two schools in the state that I found that offer the kind of program and degree that I want--an MAT in Secondary Ed with a concentration in French.  If, heaven forbid, I don't make it in, I'll work for a year and then start applying out of state.

Yes, I am talking about Street Fighter the Movie. HAHAHAHAHAHHA.  I used to be obsessed with that movie.  Now all I need to do is go to all star band and then get made fun of/beaten up and my fifth grade revival will be complete. wo0t!

yesterday I also got my new lovies, Harriet and Tubby.  aka my new 30 gig ipod and macbook.  a what what??  exactly.  all in preparation for la france.  I also finished painting the room (finally) and am about halfway done with the final cleaning process. Tomorrow my phone contract is up and I am buying the phone of my dreams, because it's on saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaale.  I will have it for a month, then be parted for 8, hahahaha.  I don't care because it will be beautiful.

I am slowly getting excited about France, just because I've been talking to so many people in my academie.  I met a fellow french major/japanese minor!!  He doesn't know it yet, but we're getting married and adopting asian babies.  I thought I'd wait a bit to break the news to him.

my knee feels very liquidy today, which suuuuucks.  um.  I don't know.  I feel as if there should be so much more to say but I really can't think of anything (have not had my coffe yet).

i'm at the library because i'm here with friends.  i've never enjoyed the library, but it's different when you have friends you can be miserable with.  we actually just got back from a pancake study break at wold house, where i totally scored a wold house tee-shirt.  i think at this point i have...9 free union college tee shirts, ha!  1 wold, 2 green house, 2 accepting the best, 1 springfest, 1 ambassadors, 2 tye-dye.  wo0t for free clothes!

it's kind of surreal right now.  i'm working out my summer (since I will not be returning to the bandn) and trying not to stress about the big move, but all in all it comes down to the fact that soon i will no longer be at union college.

I guess its kind of the way I like wearing heels and shoes that make the clicky sounds because I always associated that sound with being old and mature and sophisticated.  I blame it on elementary school.

"event","this whole week has been very stressful and overwhelming and I can't wait to just get sleep.&nbsp; I can't remember the last time I really had a good nights sleep and didn' wake up a million times and wonder if I got everything done and did everything right and made the right choices.

so tonight was ""halloween"" at union college.&nbsp; I spent over 2 weeks making my costume (I was Athena!)&nbsp; and it actually ended up coming out great.&nbsp; I didn't take any pictures but everyone else did so I should have some to post eventually.&nbsp; I didn't even use a patteren, it is all my design and creation!!

so obviously I am still shitfaced but I am feeling a lot better.&nbsp; I was nervous about my costume because I thought it was shitty and lame, but once I did my hair and make up and such it looked fantastic.&nbsp; Fun times drinking, though I bought myself some Captain Morgans and only got like, two sips of it.&nbsp; Fucking whores owe me rum.&nbsp; We went to music and culture house which was fun for a while.&nbsp; But my roomie from last year, Shai, was really sick.&nbsp; and when I say really sick I mean she didn't know where she was and couldn't keep her eyes open.&nbsp; I insisted we call campus safety m but the two girls with her didn't want to and told me to leave her alone.&nbsp; Fucking girl couldn't stand on her own, or keep her eyes open.&nbsp; They tried to walk her home but couldn't, and eventually got into a car to go back to her dorm.&nbsp; I told the driver not to leave and I called campus safety, to take her to the hospital.&nbsp; The car drove off, so I called campus safety back and told them they were going back to her dorm and told them what she looked like and who she was with.&nbsp; thankfully the driver, jess, was asertive and just dropped them all off at the hospital.&nbsp; I don't care i fthey get mad that i called campus safety, shais health is more important to me than anything else.

so then music and culture became lame and we went to the iota party, which was also lame.&nbsp; I walked around campus with my dress around my waist to keep my arms warm (I was wearing leggings).&nbsp; On the walk back I ran into Tony and so he was a gentleman and offered me his arm and walked me home.&nbsp; Huzzah!&nbsp; So here i am, home, safe and sound and&nbsp;a little too drunk for bed, though I made sure to clean my bed off before I left (thats why I'm an honors student!0&nbsp; I'm fucking exhausted but I'm not in the right state for sleep (not that I puke or get hung over, I just don't like going to bed like this) so I think I will stay up for alittle longer and stop writing livejournal entries that probably don't make sense to anyone ut me and are full of spelling errors.&nbsp; so good night and god bless"

"event","<p>I've been back at school for a week now and I have to say its turning out very well.</p>
<p>My apartment is so incredibly awesome it isn't even kidding.&nbsp; It's on the second floor.&nbsp; When you enter you walk into the living room, which has a wall of windows and enough room for a love seat, two chairs, a coffee table, 3 end tables, and then some.&nbsp; Immediately to your left from the front door (if you do like, a 280) is my room, which is enormous.&nbsp; It also has a wall of windows, and a closet big enough to fit the like, 24 pairs of shoes I brought with me.. I didn't know I had that many!!!!&nbsp; My room is super cute.&nbsp; I have a moon nightlight that I put on at night if I'm not going to be back before it gets dark.&nbsp; I had bought super cute curtains from Ikea for my windows, they have 3d roses and bumble bees on them, but the windows come with curtains, so I hung them to frame the head of my bed.&nbsp; I will post pictures soon!&nbsp; My bed was kind of shitty but I went to loews and bought particle board and made it better.</p>
<p>When you leave the living room you go through this hall that is legit 1.5 feet long.&nbsp; We strung a set of tube lighting in it for night time.&nbsp; The kitchen is also huge.&nbsp; We have a full fridge and a stove and oven and a 4 person table.&nbsp; I wish though we had more counter space and cabinet space, though our apartment did come with a microwave.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The apartment is shaped like a U, so you turn the corner and go into the back hallway.&nbsp; Theres a bookcase back there with all my coffee stuff, cookbooks, and some of robs stuff.&nbsp; His room is at the end of the hall, and as far away from my room as you can get, and less than half the size of my room..oops? HEE.&nbsp; We got a cute curtain for our bathroom--frogs!</p>
<p>My classes are ok.&nbsp; I HATE my spanish class, only because the professor sucks.&nbsp; Its spanish 1, which you take if you've never had spanish or if you've had 1 year in high school.. but she seems to teach it towards the kids who have already taken it.&nbsp; She assigns us all this work to do, and expects to read the text, understand it, and have it all memorized for the next class.&nbsp; Japanese was way easier to learn, and the fact that I can say that is WAY HORRIBLE.<br /><br />All my other classes (aka 2) are good.&nbsp; Japanese will be a struggle, but I think I'm going to use my pass/fail for spanish.<br /><br />My social life is going incredibly well, haha.&nbsp; Friday night I worked the ""door"" at the Sorum tailgate party and chatted with Kelly B.&nbsp; Then I bumped into Heidy, Shai, Arisa, Judy, Gnana, Amanda... I think thats it.&nbsp; We went to a party on seward and got there as it was busted.&nbsp; We at one point were followed by these two guys who yelled something at us and one of them winked at me, but we found out it was just Tony from Japanese and Pat, the kid who lives downstairs.&nbsp; I'm so happy Lanzasan is back at union!!&nbsp; So we went to Pats apartement (aka downstairs) and hung out there for a while, then went 1 am bbq at blue.<br /><br />Saturday..hahaha. oh Saturday.&nbsp; I never showered, which stank because some que j'aime beaucoup est venu.&nbsp; We chilled for a while and he mentioned he was at the party downstairs, so I threw on clothes and went down (I had mentioned to pat the night before I was going to invite myself, lol.)&nbsp; Josie from the ship was there, so we chatted for a bit.&nbsp; Then Sandy called and confirmed the plans for the night.<br /><br />Sat was ChiChi's birthday so we decided to go to Waterworks, one of the gay clubs in albany.&nbsp; No, I have nothing important I need to tell you, lol.&nbsp; I had already been drinking, but we had 2 DDs so we piled into my car and went...and Max is never driving my car again.&nbsp; Anyways, Waterworks was fun until half our group got kicked out, lol.&nbsp; Max, one of the DDs, for accepting a drink from a waiter and drinking it (JERK) and Chichi and John for giving alcohol to a minor..haha.&nbsp; So we piled into the cars and went to Denny's, where I had a yummy french toast breakfast at 3 in the morning.&nbsp; Made it home by 4,&nbsp; asleep by 401, lol.<br /><br />Yesterday I just did work, then Robs friends came over for chinese food.&nbsp; It was fun, I &lt;3 his friend Ariel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Today was classes and unfortunately a lot of pain.&nbsp; I have a lot of stupid health problems right now and am still getting used to the medications.&nbsp; Almost threw up at one point, but I made yummy banana bread and one does not waste the bb, so all was held in.<br /><br />I've been doing work and decided to take a break, so there was my update.&nbsp; In the week I have been at school I have gone to the dining hall once.&nbsp; I like being self sufficient, and i really need to learn to cook&nbsp;not only for me but for my fam too so that I can take up some of the dinner responsibilities when I am home.<br /><br />Thats it for nowww</p>"

"event","so I'm at school in our fantastically huge apartment...but my internet is not working.  why does this always happen to me?  my internet never wants to work,, and now rob has gone off on a booty call and I'm all by myself and I don't want to continue unpacking.  I think I am just going to read trashy magazines and go to sleep, and pray to god that the people downstairs (or maybe upstairs?) aren't always this loud."

"event","so I'm back from one of the most incredible experiences of my lifetime and while I would love to gush about it, I can't.

I'm too depressed.

The minute I left the ship I have just been hit with bad news after bad news.&nbsp; I got my first B ever in my college career.&nbsp; I HAVE NO JOB.&nbsp; Barnes and Noble can't afford to take me back.&nbsp; I talked to a manager at Hingham who swore they were hiring but when I went today I was told they aren't.&nbsp; I need to go to bandn and talk to them and figure out what is going on but I'm really dreading it, since every time I think about it I burst into tears.

So pretty much there goes my plans for the year.&nbsp; No research in France.&nbsp; No spring break.&nbsp; No pretty decor for my apartment.&nbsp; Sorry boo.

In other news, who wants to go to a Better than Ezra/Sister Hazel concert in August with me? $16."

"event","I'm....annoyed.  I have a week and a half of classes left and I just want to get out of here.  I've been excited because my grades are going so well, and then I got a french paper back today and had an 85.  Thats the lowest grade I've ever gotten on a french paper in my college career.  So obviously I am going to re-write it, especially since we're required to re-write at least one paper.  But I'm annoyed because we passed these papers in the 8th and just got them back now.  I know thats 2 weeks, but when your trimester is only 10 weeks long, 2 weeks is a lot of time.  And next week is the last week of classes, and I don't know how I""m supposed to squeeze in this damn revision in the middle of all the rest of the work I need to get done.

Most professors I have take a week at most to get papers back.  What the fuck takes her so long to do it?

So now I'm cranky, though slightly excited because I'm actually hungry, and with all the stressing I've done (to the point where I made myself physically ill) I haven't had an appetite in ages.

and to make it even worse... I had a craving to watch Mulan II last night and so I open up the dvd case and found... MOULIN ROUGE.  SAY IT OUT LOUD AND SEE WHAT MADE ME EVEN MORE MADDD.

send me love.  or come visit me.  YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO (jess falbo)"

I hope he gets replaced by someone who doesn't have their head up their ass and is loving it there.  Seriously, you think married people are boring, dude?  Why not kill off Cyclops instead!?  Does anyone actually like that dip?  And the thought of Emma Frost kissing <i>him</i> is <i>revolting</i>.  He's yucky, and her poor taste is making me not respect a character I'm supposed to &hearts; lovingly and hardcorely.

Most of it has healed, but there's still this palm-sized patch on my thigh . . . the large blister that had immediately popped is now less than half its original size and is scabbing over, but the area around it is still pink and sometimes feels hotter than the skin around it, unless I'm just imagining it.  It doesn't feel sore, though, except when the scab pulls from sitting . . . the way I tend to sit.

I've tried googling about the skin being hot, but can't find anything relating to my kind of situation.  Does anyone know what I could or should do, or if I should be more worried than I am?"

"event","Thank fuckbutt.  After months of confusion, and a half-day of searching (most recently, anyways), I finally stumbled into information that lead me to the character sheets in the Dragon Age toolset.  While they're very basic, rough, and sometimes outdated (Alistair is listed as aged 32 when lore + word of Gaider + the personality suggest that he's likeliest between ages 18-22), they still provide interesting snippets of information for lesser characters and gives some extra understanding to other, more established characters.  SO RELIEVED.  Thanks be to whatever.


Also, Lloyd is consistently referred to as 'Fat Lloyd' . . . and I think that's great. &hearts;



Edit:  Pretty bummed that I can't get character sheets for the Awakening cast, though.  The Nathaniel age thing is still bugging me.  Mako guessed him to be around 26, which seems fine, but if we look at real world squiring, he would have been sent to the Free Marches at around 12, I think? making him 20-ish at the beginning of the game.  His personality can be attributed to either age, so <i>that's</i> no help, and <i>all</i> Dragon Age men appear older than they are.  Blerg."

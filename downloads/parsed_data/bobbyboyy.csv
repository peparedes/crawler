"event","Wow I havent thought of this site in such a long time, but for some reason i did tonight. I'm thinking i might actually start this up again. Reading my old entries was fun and of course i have changed alot since then. One thing that hasnt changed is my ability to type the least i can but I'm gonna try working on that. I'm almost constantly feeling melancholy lately, especially when i think of her. We talked for such a long time and just when i thought things would change, they have gone pretty much back to what they were before. I'm not satisfied yet and I really wish i could finally rid myself of these feelings but I've tried and its just not possible right now. I really wish i was in the city right now, on those hardwood floors at bridge that changed my life last summer, riding the subway to Chelsea everynight to see the beautiful girls at Parson's and the Ailey program and walking around with E and Laura or jamming in the sweatbox at Fazil's. Things just get worse and worse here and I dont know if i can last another year. Of course i will but things need to change. She needs to change, my father needs to change, my whole situation is draining me day by day and without school to distract me i feel it more everyday. NY took all of those problems away last time and gave me something to look forward too and hope and faith in my future but I am all out of inspiration. I havent been practicing, I havent had a lesson in God knows how long and as much as i want to practice i just cant. I'll just sit there, looking at my case and hitting myself in the head for bieng so stupid. I'm tired of bieng independant. I never wanted to be and now as my mom goes farther and farther away, this constant longing makes itself more noticible in my head and its fucking everything up."

"event","i have no feelings, no reaction, no soul, no compassion. i keep asking myself not why did this happen to me. My family. but why have i not broken down and started crying, broken things, any form of releasing my emotions that never existed in the first place. I once cried because my great aunt died. i never ""met"" her, she could not even talk, eat, or function. but yet i still cried when i got the news. my great grandmother did not even express as much emotion as me. maybe thats why. have i wasted it? no. it must have been fake. what is wrong with me. the answer is simple. me. i am what is wrong with me. me is what is wrong with i. it doesnt take a psychologist to think logically yet she listens to their echos everytime. and him, the whole world is against him. his own offspring. bullshit i say. caring is not love, love is not caring, if they were the same then they would not be 2 different words. love is an excuse, a way to get out of it. caring is the hard way, as sad as it may be, it is material. dont tell me u love me. dont tell me u care about me. im not stupid, i can think for myself. im not brainwashed. i can see the truth. i have not betrayed u, nature has betrayed us all. not just me, o sorry, i mean you. i remember when i was happy. no, i mean happy. not the fakeness u see everyday, the happy i expressed on the beach, swimming as if a rip tide could never carry me away. but it did didnt it. it carried us all away. and now the result is me. stuck in the middle, stranded on an island with no emotion."

I performed with the orchestra on sun at Lincoln theater and it was sooo funny. First, the guest speaker as usual couldnt pronounce maetro kaniyama's name so when the concert master came out to tune us...i looked at him and we both started to crack up. Then in the last piece...every time there was a long marimba solo, some guy in the audience would moan because he had a mental problem or something. Normally, this would not effect me at all, but this really stupid kid behind me started laughing a little loud, which was not really cool, But since it was a distraction...people (including me)started to chuckle a little. It was so hard to hold it in and i almost peed myself. When i looked up at kaniyama, expecting him to be ashamed, he was chuckling a little too! It was so funny, i couldnt breathe and it was seriously the hardest test of self control i have ever been through."

Man is he awesome!!! not only does he play violin and said he could sell me his old but nice and originally expensive electric violin, but he also is starting a latin/rock/hip-hop/jazz/go-go band! This guy is just like me except hispanic! then i bought a pair of drum sticks. no more waiting for Yoni to finish with his drumsticks so i can have them for myself! 

Oh yeah, while at orchestra today, i get on to the stage and Mr. Samandari tells me to sit principle (first chair of the 2nd violins) Not to be cocky, but usually this would not be a big deal, BUUUUTTT i just moved up into the orchestra so its kinda weird seeing as there are people that have been there longer than me and might be better than me. What is funny is that my teacher expects me to be sitting there. (is it her, or do i just have a lack of confidence) anyway, we had this guest xylophone player from the national symphony orchestra to play rhapsody in blue for the concert and she was amazing!! she was holding two sticks in hand and was just jumping around this huge xylophone. When we finished with her, we got a break so i went into the cafeteria. Mr. Samandari comes up to me saying that he and Mr. Maclain (this grumpy old conductor that has been there forever) had talked about me sitting as principle earlier and that they wanted me to keep the seat. WTF! i dont think that i am that good! i just hope the other people in 2nd dont hate me.

"event","RESUME - GEORGE W. BUSH
 EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE (more bad things Bush has done)

 LAW ENFORCEMENT:

 I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under
the
 influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my
driver's
 license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been
""lost""
 and is not available.

 MILITARY:

 I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to
take 
 a
 drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the
 Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in
Vietnam.

 COLLEGE:

 I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a
 cheerleader.

 PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:

 I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil
business
 in Midland, Texas, in 1975. I bought an oil company, but couldn't
find
 any oil in Texas. The company went bankrupt shortly after I sold
all my
 stock. I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart
deal
 that took land using taxpayer money. With the help of my father and
our
 right-wing friends in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken
Lay), I
 was elected governor of Texas.

 ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:

 I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies,
making
 Texas the most polluted state in the Union.

 During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most
smog-ridden
 city in America. I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to
the
 tune of billions in borrowed money.

 I set the record for the most executions by any governor in
American
 history.

 With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my
father's
 appointments to the Supreme Court, I became president after losing
by
 over 500,000 votes.

 ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:

 I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with a
 criminal
 record.

 I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over
one
 billion dollars per week.

 I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S.
Treasury.

 I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S.
history.

 I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any
 12-month period.

 I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month
period.

 I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of
the
 U.S. stock market.

 In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their
jobs 
 and
 that trend continues every month.

 I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any
 administration in U.S. history. My ""poorest millionaire,""
Condoleeza
 Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her.

 I set the record for most campaign fundraising trips by a U.S.
 President.

 I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the
most
 corporate campaign donations.

 My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of my best
friends,
 Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud
in
 U.S. History, Enron. My political party used Enron private jets and
 corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme
Court
 during my election decision.

 I have protected my friends at Enron and Halliburton against
 investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent
 investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent
 investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history.

 I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and
refused 
 to
 intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.

 I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history.

 I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be
awarded
 government contracts.

 I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any
 President in U.S. history.

 I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest
bureaucracy in
 the history of the United States government.

 I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S.
 history.

 I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations
 remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission.--this is true.

 I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law.--actually what
 happened
 is the World Court is changing into the International Criminal
 Court--because the US wants to be a part of the court, but not be
open
 to having the US have charges brought up against them, they have
 temporarily ceased negotiating with the countries involved in and
 taking
 part in the establishment of the ICC. So, in other words, the US
wants
 to be able to establish the laws within the ICC, practice those
laws
 within the ICC, but not have those laws applied to our country.

 I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. ""prisoners of war""
 detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva
 Convention.--Guantanomo Bay.

 I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations
election
 inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).

 I set the record for fewest number of press conferences of any
 President
 since the advent of television.

 I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year
 period.

 After taking off the entire month of August, I presided over the
worst
 security failure in U.S. history.

 I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade
Center
 attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most disliked
 country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world
 history.

 I have set the all-time record for most people worldwide to
 simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people),
 shattering the record for protest against any person in the history
of
 mankind.

 I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked,
 preemptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign
nation. I
 did so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S.
 citizens, and the world community.

 I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut
in
 duty benefits for active duty troops and their families - in
wartime.

 In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for
 attacking
 Iraq, then blamed the lies on our British friends.

 I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans
 (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and
 security.

 I am supporting development of a nuclear ""Tactical Bunker Buster,""
WMD.

 I have so far failed to fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden
to justice.

 RECORDS AND REFERENCES:

 All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my
father's
 library, sealed and unavailable for public view.

 All records of SEC investigations into my insider trading and my
 bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public
 view.

 All records or minutes from meetings that I, or my Vice-President,
 attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and
 unavailable for public view."

"event","What really has me gone is the fact that I can have feelings for someone I only know a few facts about. It freaks me out that i wish and wish we could have something but i know it could never happen, but maybe it could. Maybe if i let them know im interested in them i could learn more about them and let them know something about me and in doing so, bring us closer together. But before that happens, in comes the fear of embarrassment and rejection, So im caught between two (what i feel are) predicaments. Should i take the risk? If i dont nothing will happen and i will never know what could have happened if i had. Basically, i need to let my walls down and take some risks even though they may seem small to other people"

"event","School is almost here, camp is almost over. I dont know wich fact i like the most and i dont know why i feel this way, but the summer seemed way to short and unmeaningful. and the bright side  of things the wycleff/soul asylum show was pretty fun. at one wycleff shouted for everyone to take their shirts off and swing them around in the air. To my suprise everyone did including one of the girls i went to the show with. after that we went to silver diner and had a couple of platters of cheese fries. We had yet another game of ultimate frisby against calleva and lost once again. Good thing about it was that i made up for the two catches i missed last game with 5 goals. Yoni is almost back from his camp wich is awesome because i have not played hey joe in 8 weeks. And one other great thing is that i got into music at school! my moms pissed cause she wanted me in spanish but too bad."

"event","Surprisingly enough, this weekend went by kicky fast. Saturday was awesome, it was pretty much worth missing hfstival. We performed on the millenium stage and i thought there weren't gonna be a lot of people but when i got on stage and looked out i was like HOLY SHIT!!!! almost the whole hall was filled up with people that actually came to see us and were not there to see something else. So that made my day;) Another cool thing that happened this weekend was 1. i went to see the matrix reloaded and 2. I finally FIXED MY DRUM SET!!!!! now im playing so much more. O yeah i forgot one thing. i went out to lunch with my friend and we stopped by this coffey place at the watergate and i discovered the love of my life......HOT WHITE CHOCOLATE! it was the best thing i have EVER tasted, and i mean ever when i say ever."

I'm pretty exited for the keneddy center show im gonna be performing at this weekend, and rehearsal wensday night. TWA is a good way to get away from all the obnoxiouse people at my school, and just talk with my boy trey and dance. Yes, if you did not know, i tap dance. Whether you think its stupid or wierd,i don't really care cause i love it as much as i love playing music (which is a lot). I've been feelin kinda depressed lately and i can't really explain why. Maybe its cause im realizing im gonna have to start being more focused on school then other things, or maybe its my mom lecturing me day and night about how important this and that is. i just wrote another song and i'm feelin pretty good about it. Well i should probably get started on some work. as amy dahan would say (she is from the suburbs, so this really cracks me up) HOLLA!!!"

"event","This week went by pretty well, i handed in almost all my things on time (especially history stuff). It wasn't as hard as i had expected it to be. I guess once in a while you just have to stop feeling bad for yourself and get off your ass so you can do some work. Today pretty much was the worst day though. IT was trip day. We went to the african art museum which was pretty cool, especially the martin luther king jr part, although i wonder why an exhibit like that would be there but it was still good. The slave driver (my mom) required me to practically clean the hole house if i wanted to go to some melech thing tommorrow, and i cleaned it but i doubt she will let me go. just in response to yoni, as you should know...kashmir is my favorite song so whats wrong with putting that down? to tell you the truth i had done it before i had even seen your name. And also i wrote that first entry when i was thinking about it, and i don't thing that everything i said had to do with you. just had to say that"

Its not that hard if you have 2-3 people working with you cause you each get three or two notes to wright, not me! i have to finish all 6 this week AND wright my sentence outline. im not going to say its not fair because it really isnt. its just hard having to do a project that is meant for more than one person. I dont really know how im gonna pull this off but im gonna try to try my hardest. I dont know if i will ever get a chance to relax in the next month. hopefully things will change very soon."

He says he just wants to play music but does playing in a band not count as ""playing music""? well for now it does not really matter cause i'm not really ready, but if he still feels the same way by next year its going to really suck. for now i guess its fun playing random songs but after a while i want to play original stuff. If he ends up not wanting to start anything it will e impossible to play in a band because no one else has any real musical talent or knowledge in our grade. And if they do, they our just too annoying or semthing (micah). i guess its just yoni and zaqui."

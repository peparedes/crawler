"event","After completing my plan to cross the US border into California last Spring, I dug into the migrant worker scene for the duration of the Summer. I worked as a near-slave, ever watchful for clues to the whereabouts of the Western US chapter of S.P.E.C.T.R.E. 

I met a helpful native named Jesus Martinez who I enlisted to my cause using crass generalizations about his culture manifest in woefully dated stereotypes and racist jokes. Between siestas, domestic disputes involving found-objects and switchblades as weapons, and rides around the barrio in hydraulically enhanced vintage American cars, Jesus was of great use to Mother England. My only problem was his incessant protesting and absenteeism. I frequently had to track him down at his condo or his gym or office. He kept saying that he didn't work in the lettuce-picking industry, but that he was a CPA from Sacramento, that he'd never lived in a barrio and that he'd rather attend a Catholic mass than paste his name in an arc of old English letters across the back window of his car. I admired his efforts, but one doesn't spend 40 years in MI6 only to be fooled by the most basic disguises. But fine, I said, DON'T come low-riding and see if I care. More cucarachas for me, if you know what I mean. 

Three months of working for 12 cents an hour in a lettuce patch paid off. I got a strange rash from a woman named 'Muerta' and I found a link between the commercial lettuce industry and Ernst Stavro Blofeld, evil head of evil, evil S.P.E.C.T.R.E. Immediately, I began an impromptu craps game at which I won 750,000 Lira with which to fund the second phase of my plan. 

First, I shaved my thick beard and mustache in preparation for my clever disguise: A thick-bearded flannel-wearing mountain man. Lacking flannel, I chose to alternately wear a tuxedo adorned with a red carnation. I wasn't in the mood to grow a new beard, either, so I just went for the chin-assed Adonis look and hoped I'd blend in with the other mountain men. 

I engaged the inflatable car I'd been issued long ago by Q-branch which I had for many months now mistaken for a penis-holder and drove to Seattle, Washington. There, I looked for mountain men, finding nought but men in various forms of ladies' evening wear. By the time I realized I'd ventured headlong into a S.P.E.C.T.R.E. training camp, it was too late. I was surrounded by burly men in cocktail gowns and lipstick applied as if by friendly ape. Each wore beswastikaed bling-bling and had diamonds in their teeth. 

Thinking quickly, I grabbed a nearby copy of Out magazine and fashioned it into a crude weapon, then bashed the nearest queen in the throat with it and bolted down the street and into a leather boutique, where I am currently hiding in wait of the convenient arrival of Q with an ingenious gadget designed specifically for this situation."

"event","The trickery of the Mexican government is no match for the well-honed skills of a super-secret secret agent. Posing as a migrant worker, I stowed away on a lettuce truck bound for California. I also pretended to be a mute who did not comprehend common gestures so as to avoid communicating with the smelly fool in the back of the truck with me. This only worked for so long. Ultimately, I had to give the guy a swift chop to the throat and fling him out of the payload area and into a ditch because he attempted to kiss me, or at least that's what I thought he was doing. Apparently he was attempting to retrieve the blanket I was sitting on because he was cold. I think the gestures he was making pertained to the blanket and his chilled state. Why are old people always cold?

Any day now, I will be in the states again, provided that no authorities detain us. I will employ my mute migrant worker ruse at the border and that will certainly convince them that I am a well-tanned, grizzled Mexican and not a pasty white English spy."

"event","Well, this only goes to show that Mexicans can't build a decent torture facility. I was able to escape after only 11 months. I wanted to dispatch an alert message before I get underway back to HQ. I will pick up a few handicrafts and prescription medications from the marketplace and...

Shh...One moment...

OK...Back...Damned chiclet vendors are every-freakin-where down here. They all work for S.P.E.C.T.R.E., too, the little bastards. 

Anyway...After I pick up the handicrafts, the meds and the Cuban cigars, I will progress to the USA where I will engage my next exciting adventure."

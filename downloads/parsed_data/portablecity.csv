For one, Em and I threw our yearly cocktail party! Except it was more like Em and Ed threw it and I stopped in to help set up and cut things up for the fondue. Yes, I said fondue. I took a few photos of Ed's handywork, for your entertainment.<br /><br />I'm working on setting up a weekly craft thing with the CONC Women's Hostel, but with overtime at work and a few personal things going on, I've been late getting it going. Hopefully next Sunday I'll be knitting with these women, though. I have a big yarn donation from <a href=""http://www.knitomatic.com/"">Knit-o-matic</a>, which is greatly appreciated and looks like a great stash to start with. If you have a favourite online knitting tutorial, especially one with great diagrams and minimal text, let me know. I'm going to photocopy some handouts so that the women have something to refer to between sessions. I hope they're as interested in this as I am!<br /><br />There is always the ongoing adventure of MONDO, of course, as well. We published books for Canzine (more than a month ago now!) as well as printed postcards and buttons, which was a big exciting project. I remembered how much I enjoy magazine layout, and let me tell you, I miss it every time I sit down and hard code articles for six hours. Which is once a week. Rumour has it that a database isn't far off, though, so hopefully update time will go down and external project time can go up proportionately. You'll know when it hits, though, because that's when Miles and I will disappear for two weeks into a serious coding adventure, and then emerge with the prettiest damn website you ever did see.<br /><br />I'm starting to think about christmas presents, now. Have any of you started your shopping? How's that going?"

"event","Who wants to read Lost Girls next?<br /><br />I'm going to sit on a full review, probably for MONDO (or maybe just to sort it all out in my mind) and just give youa once-over here.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""cut for lewdness, also maybe spoilers"">My biggest question is honestly, what was the point? Where was this book going? Three graphic (VERY graphic) graphic novels, hardcover bound in a box set, and I was (absurdly?) expecting some sort of resolution - some sort of satisfaction (haha!) some sort of climax at least! This book left me without any catharsis, because I'm still not sure what the problems were.<br /><br />Three grown women, who are AT THAT VERY MOMENT doing quite absurd sexual things to one another, apparently tirelessly, are not going to shock me with revelations from their past. If they felt at any point that they were living too hedonistic a life, the events under which they were relating that regret were, certainly, incredibly hedonistic.<br /><br />The content was, I think, supposed to be shocking, but within a few pages I was quite numb to it all. Moore quickly blurred the lines between kinky sex and violence, partnership and prostitution, between threesomes, foursomes, orgies and gang-rape, between having sex ON drugs and having sex FOR drugs... and it was all rather grossly enmeshed in ideas of trauma. Never was there an exploration of healthy relationships, healthy sex, healthy sexuality - these women were empowered, but they were dangerous the whole time.<br /><br />There was something incredibly misogynistic about the whole thing, even though the three main characters were women. There was this weird sense that they were held up as moral measuring sticks and that they had all failed, and won, and failed again, and essentially given up. But they weren't forgiven.<br /><br />I don't know. I mean, writing anything about the sex lives of three women doing kinky things in 1914 is going to create a context of secrecy, guilt and conspiracy (arguably it doesn't matter when you set it) and inevitably.... it is going to get ugly.<br /><br />And this is my other problem. The art.<br /><br />The art got stronger (thank god) but I don't know if it ever got better. This story&amp;nbsp; had many problems, but the art is what made the tone so unclear. If you draw it like a fairy tale illustration then yes, some of the images are going to be shocking (the things these people do!) but three books of them makes you numb, and I felt that the art style served only for that shockingness and didn't enhance much else. Anyways, the best parts were the weird, kinky chapter splash illustrations that were the most overt bridge between the three womens' stories and the original stories of Wendy, Dorothy and Alice.<br /><br />....am I glad I read it? Well I was curious, but it... wasn't rewarding in the ways I'd hoped for. That said, if you want three books of women having their way with one another, here you are.<br /> </div>"

I don't know what would have been better, but...<br /><br />And yeah, Moore does not like his characters, or his reader.<br /><br />So, $30 worth of reading? I dunno, not really. Maybe the other two books will be better... or at least more interesting. He's just not making me THINK yet.<br />"

"event","I'm promising myself I'll write more, just in general, and since this is what LJ's for (right? writing?) hopefully something entertaining will appear here for people on my friends' list.

My N.D.A.'d job is going well so far - I'm learning the machines and the procedure and the programs, and getting to know my coworkers. My supervisor is a delightful lady who is capable of laughing at the ins and outs of print production drama, and she definitely makes us all feel like we're part of a team here in production. Some days are rather dull, but so far that's the worst of it. I was getting a bit tired of the 8:30-5 routine, but now for the month of July we're on odd hours (with a sprinkling of overtime...) so that's almost a relief, to be honest! Like, this week I'm working 10-6:30 for three days, and then 6-2:30 for the fourth, and while that won't be a party it will be interesting and should keep me awake.

On a related note, I've lost my daytimer. I'm confident it is somewhere in my bedroom, but after turning half the room upside down as I assembled a wardrobe this weekend, I have to admit that it is most likely behind the dresser, which is going to be a challenge to move. So if I've missed dates, or been hesitant to commit to anything, it's because I don't have a clue what I've committed to already, and I'm too stubborn to buy a new daytimer when I have six good months left in this one, and all my friends' birthdays already entered. Also it was a moleskin, and it has this swanky pocket... I'll have the energy to move my dresser after I've tidied and cleaned enough of my stuff to have a place to put everything currently piled onto my dresser, I think.

With the addition of a wardrobe to my room I am feeling much, much more at home. The wardrobe adventure was lovely, as well, in that Dan helped me carry it (despite belt problems)&nbsp; and it was on sale. So I saved lots and lots of money on this wardrobe, which I then spent on a dress and a nice shirt and flipflops and a Kid Koala concert and drinks at the concert and so on and so forth and now I'm broke again. Which is okay, because I need to eat more food from home as it stands. Home's getting homey-er, as we get stuff up on the walls, find a routine with each other, work out how to keep the kitchen clean, and I actually start contributing to the cleaning schedule on the board. Having helped Miles paint most of his apartment, I do feel the itch to do the same to ours, but not until I get a steady balance in my bank account, I think. In addition to paint, we still need a toaster, a kettle and a tv with a dvd player at least. Next time I'm in Oakville I'll see what my family's not using. My bedroom itself is still chaotic, but step by step it's coming together. I got rid of the last big box, now I'm left with assorted shoeboxes and as such to empty and put away. Amazing how long it takes to move in, eh? Just boggling.
I had the realization a few weeks ago that I am living my childhood dream. How so, you ask? Well, all I really wanted was a place of my own in Toronto, a neighbourhood to wander with friends nearby, room to do art and roommates to do it with, and income that didn't suck the soul from me&nbsp;in return. I know, I wasn't a big dreamer as a child. I guess I wanted a flowery romance, too, but at least I have the room for a flowery romance in my life now, if not the actual product. Like that space above my aloe plant I'm reserving for an awesome print - I trust it will be there eventually. But now that I've achieved my dream, what the hell do I do with myself?

Tough question.

This week had been proof that I've done it, though. I've been out almost every night, seeing live music and theatre, going drinking and eating out, shopping for snazzy clothes in weird stores (also Dufferin Mall, which was not, I do admit, ever a part of my childhood dreams) ... and, well, it's been expensive, is the sad part. More expensive than I can afford right now. So, cut back on the shopping, the eating out, take more pride in my cooking (haha! ha!) and have at-home activities more often. And yesterday afternoon that's what I did: my main purchase was a coffee while I sat and knitted in the Concord for an hour, and then I came home, made some soup and listened to CBC's Saturday Night Blues Show and continued with the knitting, waiting to see if something would pop into my head to draw.

I think I can learn to budget. The hardest part is lunches at work - I really hate sandwiches. Breakfast is tough too, cause I sleep in and have to rush there and end up eating chips and a pop on the bus up. I'm going to try walking there this week, at least for the 10AM shifts. It'll be good for me, and it will give me time to eat an apple along the way. If I get the energy to hit up No Frills I'll pick up some no-name bulk granola bars and muffins, and between the three I should be fed every morning for the week. Shopping this week was an indulgence because I got a government check and didn't think to just put it towards my Visa, but to be honest I really did need this damn wardrobe. The dress, shirt and flipflops were less necessary, I admit. I should put shopping aside for now. I should replace it with crafting! But the trouble with crafting is you get halfway into a project only to discover you need to purchase some key element and suddenly your money-saving activity just opened a whole new line of expenses. So learning to budget will be tough, I guess.

Maybe if I find my daytimer I can start recording all of my purchases each day and give myself some perspective! I'll check under the bed first.

MONDO is going well, as well. I certainly never saw myself running a magazine of this scope, so it's exciting in a new, surprising way. I submitted a comic last week, so my internet fame has begun! I'm considering writing reviews of the shows I've seen, but mostly I just want to continue with the comics - I'm not a confidant article writer, especially not when I see the calibre of content we have up already. I'm trying to shove my nose into the whole magazine more deeply, though, do more general editing and make more noise as an E-i-C to compensate for not really participating otherwise...

Hmm.

I started this entry with the intent of simply listing all the cool shit I've been doing, but it got way off topic, eh? Rest assured, I've been doing cool shit. Maybe I'll take the time over lunch at work someday this week to list it? We'll see. Till then, I'm going to try and find my damn daytimer."

I'm always short on patience by the time I've carried all my laundry to the elevator, and then down the hall and up the stairs that follow. To be honest, I put off my time with the washing machine until I'm forced to rush through the whole experience, and I think it's done nothing but create tension between us. Maybe, if I just set aside more time, the machine and I would get along better? But it isn't all me - I would be much more inclined to spend time with a machine that didn't cost me $2 for the basic service. I feel sometimes like my economic status becomes a barrier between us, and I can go weeks without seeing my washer simply because I can't afford to. So, maybe--perhaps--I like to think, at least, that I'm not the only reason this relationship isn't working.<br /><br />You know, I have to admit, I'm seriously thinking about moving on.

Well, my grandfather passed away last Monday. The funeral is tomorrow (today? Saturday.) and then life kinda begins again. I don't really know how to talk about it yet - I haven't really processed it, so I don't really want to ""work through it"" yet with anyone, despite offers of help, liquor and comfort food/shopping. I'm hoping to get through the backlog of work I've created by missing class/being unable to focus and then start to deal with this.

Of course, at the very same time, Robin's decided to show up and start dating me, which has been lovely and conveniently timed to coincide with some of my loneliest moments this year. The only tragic part is that he resides in Oakville, and I'm short on travel time while I finish the term. I'm sure you'll all hear about how that works out.&nbsp;

Hopefully I get my head screwed back on soon, as I have a lot of painting transactions to finalize, homework to catch up on, MONDOwork to delve into, and housework to feel bad about avoiding. o_O...

It's incredibly epic.

I wouldn't know what to visualize to it - the content is really nonliteral. Except I'm sure there are trees. Big, dark trees. I kind of link it to a Friedrich painting, really."

"event","It's a new year. I'm 21 for 37 more days. I'm drunk. I drank so much baileys. Me me me me me. I have to code all day tomorrow, goddammit. Miles, you're coding too. But I'm not coming down there. I'll explain it over the phone or something.<br /><br />New Year's Resolutions:<br /><br /><b>1) Do lots!</b> I'm happiest when I'm doing stuff (coding, painting, sewing, reading, even writing) so the more I do, the happier I'll be, right?<br /><b>2) Take time off.</b> I also like movies. I should really rent more! And I should read recreationally. And take days for sleeping in and organizing my photos, cause I love doing that. Like, tagging them and stuff.<br /><b>3) Organize usefully. </b>Not in a way that's beyond my ability to remember.<br /><b>4) Keep up on the basic news.</b> It makes conversation a lot easier, and, I mean, I do care, a bit.<br /><b>5) Eat HEALTHIER.</b> I hate having months where I know I'm living off of cheese, bacon and coke. My stomach hates them too.<br /><br />I guess in the new year I want to be proud of myself, and I also want to reach out more to other people. I think it's possible to do both - I'm gonna find out.<br /><br />Other things I'm going to have to do in this new year:<br /><b>1) Graduate! </b>(AAAAAAAAAAAAUUUGGGHHH!! <i>the real world!!!!</i>)<br /><b>2) Find a new roommate.</b> Em, I'm gonna miss yoooou T_T;; Maybe Adam'll give in and live north of Bloor with me?<br /><b>3) Get a job. </b>Any job that'll pay rent, to start, and then I need to start finding ways to make money doing something I like. But for starters, let's pay rent.<br /><b>4) TRAVEL.</b> Goddammit, Toronto's awesome, but I need to see some trees. And distant family. And distant friends!<br /><b>5) MONDO. </b>I'm committed, it's a big part of my life, I'm gonna make it awesome. For all that I sometimes want to kill him, Miles has been instrumental to getting this shit going, and I'm confidant that, beyond his dislike of code, he'll continue to be 'that other motivated guy' on the project. *kick* Which is awesome.<br /><br />I don't really know where to start here. This year has been CRAZY. I thought '05 was nuts, I thought '04 was crazy, and even '03 seemed a little off the hook, but this one's been just as bizarre, even if I didn't leave the province. Actually, the farthest I went this year was Niagara Falls! That's, well, that's just nutso. But I guess I've been farther in other ways, doing things I didn't predict myself doing, and surviving the inevitable consequences. Also, growing my hair long. Very long. So I guess I'm impressed (and a tad shocked) at myself this past year, and so as long as I remember to, like, take responsibility and deal with things, I should be able to avoid major self-loathing. Also, while I sometimes continue to have anxiety attacks about it, I think I've got a pretty solid base of good friends around me. I really should reach out to them more. And not worry so much.<br /><br />Having now been single for 14 months, I can attest to two things: 1) being single means being generally guilt free, which is fantastic! except... 2) being single means that any clingy, affectionate, nuzzly moments end up guilt-ridden, at least on some level. So yeah. I kind of feel like I've worked out everything I'm gonna work out by being single right now, and I'm quite ready for the next fluffy giddy cute wave of relationship-ness. Preferably with someone who will drive to St. John's with me.<br /><br />I also feel like I need to branch out a bit more. I hope I get some neat jobs and internships and volunteer positions over the next year, and maybe find some places to settle in. I also am interested to find out how good I am at holding a job for a long time. I haven't had long-term employment since Cotton Ginny, and man I hated that by the end. I wonder if I have the attention span for a long-term job ANYWHERE, so I'm kind of excited to find out. Also, I mean, I do want to be an artist, so I suppose I should find an art crowd to mingle with at openings. Also, make more art.<br /><br />.... I didn't really think too hard about this entry, and I'm not sure why I wrote it, but it seems to be publishable, so ta-da! Happy new year, I'm drunk and stoic, and getting good at it!"

I lost my crutch and the holiday season hit me unprepared, as always, but that was no reason to beat the rest of you up over it! Besides, friends are what made the good parts great.&nbsp; Yadayadayada, sorry for being a bitch. It's over now, and all I have to survive is new year's eve, which I intend to navigate in the same fashion as last year: through a wine and liquor-induced haze. If I host the party, though, I can sleep in my own bed and manage the hangover at home with some OJ and block-out blinds.<br /><br />Before new years, though, i'm going to have to correct this sleep schedule misalignment. I will start by moving towards bed now, as well as setting an alarm so I get OUT of bed tomorrow MORNING, not afternoon.<br /><br />All wonderful resolutions, I'm sure. Goodnight!</div>"

"event","I have begun tentative MONDOsite design (yeah, I know it's blue right now, but it's going to be a million times swankier once we launch!) and I want your feedback! These are gonna be fairly big, so beware.<br />  <div class=""ljcut"" text=""that's why it's behind a cut!"">First, my examples:<br /><br />So this would be the ""home"" or ""splash"" page, where you'd start. We'd have images and captions for a variety of newly updated articles, starting with what we'd figure to be the most exciting, and moving into reviews, shorter features, as well as favourite opinion columns or sex columns or what have you.<br /><br />The main idea is that the top and sidebar will wrap around all of our content. So that photo will serve as a ""cover"" image to MONDO. In theory, we're thinking we'll switch it up monthly.<br /><br /><img width=""774"" height=""666"" border=""1"" src=""http://www.mondomagazine.net/Mondolayout1newcolour.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />This is the same layout with a different photo, which changes the colour of the sidebar and the section headers, but nothing else.<br /><br /><img width=""774"" height=""666"" border=""1"" src=""http://www.mondomagazine.net/Mondolayout1.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Back to the blue, though, cause it was awesome. THIS is a section splash page, in this example it's the Arts section - so now you'll notice the sidebar has expanded to include arts-specific choices, like top features and as such. That'll switch up and become more section-specific as we have content to link to. For example, we'll probably throw the sex columns into the Lifestyle sidebar, because people will come looking specifically for those. The spread here is a splash page of the most recently updated Arts columns, agan with the most exciting at the top, and so on and so forth. <br /><br /><img width=""774"" height=""666"" border=""1"" src=""http://www.mondomagazine.net/Mondosectionsplash.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Now, this is an article in the arts section, so it's again within the specific Arts sidebar, but it's just the article. Don't mind the latin, that's just filler text. So I'm thinking that the three-column layout with the wraparound text and a few nice images (maybe we can click them to see bigger ones?) will be nice. Also, I intend to have the author's name be linked to a list of all the articles they've written, so if someone decides that Rachel Kahn writes hilarious articles, they can look up and see what else i""ve written, in any section. Hopefully this'll encourage people who visit us only for music or film to explore our other sections.<br /><br /><img width=""774"" height=""666"" border=""1"" src=""http://www.mondomagazine.net/Mondoarticleexample.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /></div><br />So, questions for you guys! How do I make the sidebar more exciting? What about the top bar? Is it easy to do wraparound text in CSS? How much of a bitch will it be to change the image monthly? What other features does the website need? Fill me in! I'm crossposting this <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/mondo_online/profile""><img width=""16"" height=""16"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom;"" alt=""[info]"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/community.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/mondo_online/""><b>mondo_online</b></a></div> as well, and I hope that with everyone voicing their opinions, we'll get some excellent feedback and end up with an already-swanky website to launch with!<br /><br />Anyways, keep writing and sending in your articles, and we'll see you all on the 1st!<br /><br />~Rachel"

"event","Hey!! Reflecting on my day has made me decide that I hate school and working. Im ready for retirement. Work sucked b/c of this really stupid guy blaming what he did wrong on me...stupidhead. Anyways, I'm sick of school, because well, if you go there you know. But now Im at home and I cheered up bc I just watched TGS!! I love the new issues, so if you havent seen them, you should. ""I'm in love with every boy.""-prob. one of my favorite lines. Well, Im out to talk to my bf...Phillie Pooh, so see ya later alligator."

"event","So today I had to get up early to take Courtney to soccer camp, which i think she should have to walk cause i never got rides, so that's unfair.But I took her there, got home, went to the bank, visited Gramcracker and picked up my sis again. After that I came home to do some hw, lay around being bummed that I had to miss out on going to Amanda's to swim, and then went to work. Work was a blast cause Mo-Mo wasnt there to yell at any of us..lol. I got out a lil while ago, and most Mondays are really slow, well, today it wasnt. Ugh!! It was good though cause the night went by quicker. I realized that I hate customers who have NO personality, it just brings my mood down. But one of the girls at work put tape on my back and I have no idea how long it was hanging there! It was funny, I wouldnt let that kinda thing embarress me though. But luckily my friends, amanda and lindsay are sleeping over tomorrow night...yay!!!We're gonna part-ay!! Oh and later this week my senior pic proofs are gonna come back!! Im nervous and excited, I hope it all turns out alright. *Cross your fingers* So I really need to start working on all that hw that they gave us....which is stupid cause that gives us so much less of an enjoyable summer. But I really need to do a lot of it....I guess that's what I'll do on Wed after my girls leave. I just hope Im not the only one that still has so much work to do. Oh well, I'm heading out for now. ttyl"

"event","Today was exremely busy!! First, I expected to spend a half hour at school waiting for Courtney to get recertified, but then it was an hour and a half later when I was finally leaving! UGH!! I usually dont mind having to drive my sisters places, but that pissed me off. All I did was sit around. The schools music suite is really awesome though. Me and Maria snuck in there and its so gorgeous. LOVE the color scheme.Anyways, I drove Maria home, got gas, went to Subway, and then picked up Linds and Manda to go to the movies. We saw Raising Helen, which was really cute, and then back home. Then me Courtney and my mom went to dinner, then to visit my grandma, whos so adorable. Now Im the only kid outta 5 thats home! YES! that hasnt happened in forever!! its finally quiet around here. So I had a good time at all the places I went today, the movie was funny. ""Lemme at 'em"" and ""Hippo"" LOL. SOO cute, if you havent seen it, see it. So I got to see Harold again today, good to know hes doing alright. lol. And Lindsay with those spiders, that was some funny shit. But yesterday wasnt nearly as exciting as today. Yesterday my Stepdads sister, brother-in-law and parents ate dinner here. Theyre quite interesting, and sometimes scary, but funny. Then I got into this REALLY nice, interesting convo. with Phil, my cutie patootie, and he was so sweet to me. Phil-thanks for being so understanding and loving towards me. I got really lucky somehow with you. Love you. And you were so sweet to me, thank you. Anyways, tonight im just gonna chill around my house. Ttyl. And linds, jma!!!!"

"event","So today I got up, went online, and got ready to go to lindsays for another one of our infamous hw parties!!!! So when I arrived we didnt really do much of our hw, but thats ok, cause we had fun anyways. I was in a hyper mood all day long, so at her house, i was quite the entertainment for her, im sure. and like linds, she was so good about it, that she just joined in my fun! And its never a party without lindsay!! So we had fun with harold, although he still needs to be taken to the vet (lmfao) and then we made tons more of our inside jokes. Cant wait til school to pull that noise joke. lol.But we talked for a bit, laughed tons, and had another good time like we do everytime we get together. Then I came home to get ready for work, which I got called in an hour early, which was cool cause i got to work with patricia whos really awesome! And then my cousin started today at work,so i got to be her trainer. Like always we had our fair share of nice and terrible customers. One guy will be on my bad side for a long ass time cause hes a butthole. Anyways, Mauro was really cool today, and once again, I sold $25 worth of tickets, so i get another prize. YES!!! He's a really cool guy, and for some reason, Im really glad that I work at Carmine's cause its just such a fun place and all the people are really cool. although sadly, lots of the girls are leaving cause theyre going to college soon and as Mauro says, guys dont leave at this time of year cause theyre too stupid to go to college.lol.So I had lots of fun at work too. But thats about all I did with my day, and tomorrow my plans are all up in the air, but hopefully i get to spend another day at work. That would be fun! Im gonna head up to bed cause im sleepy. ttyl. and linz....fheoihfeoihfo (lol)"

"event","So today I was SUPPOSED to hang out with manda,linz,and meg, but I decided to be retarded and end up having to go to work. So I went to work, the slowest night of them all, but it ended up going by really fast. Thats prob because Liz is SO much fun! And Mauro, the biggest horse, was in a good mood, til I messed up, but then, he was happy again! So it was all good. Anyways, I hadnt worked with Erica in forever and I finally got to work with her again today, same with Stephanie. But me and Liz were in a competition to see who could sell the most tickets for the raffle we're doing down at Carmine's. Whoever sold $25 worth of tickets got a ""surprise"". And what did we do? We BOTH made it!! (well, i had to put a dollar of my own in, but it was a tip that day, so it wasnt that bad.) Mauro was all happy and smiley cause we made it, and now we get a surprise!! Hopefully tomorrow at work we'll find out what we get! Maybe a free pizza, or a raise....lol, prob nothing. Then Im gonna want my dollar back! jk...it went to a good cause, youth hockey, so its ok....but today I also went to the doctor, who still doesnt know what my problem is with all this coughing and all, which ya know im not too happy about. And these past 2 days have been sunny and ive been at work. Oh well, im bringing in the cash so its alright with me. And i also just slept today cause i wasnt feelin too hot. Its about time for me to go rest, so that raps it up, as my girl linz always says. lol."

"event","So tomorrow is a sad day...my 3 younger siblings, Shannon, Katie, and Kelly are departing to camp for a whole 2 weeks!! I'm so pumped! Dont get me wrong, I love all my girls but they can get annoying when theyre at this teeny-bopper stage. But I'm sure they will have fun...I know I'll try. Im not sure though cause Im starting to have to work a lot more...like 5 or 6 days a week. At least I'll have some money coming in, for once. Anyways, hopefully we can all plan it so that me, linz,manda, and meag can really do something monday cause I have to go to work! Yuck! But I wont complain, cause its better than not having one at all. And so I'm talking to the love of my life, Phil on the phone...he's so cute. Im gonna go to his house tomorrow and we'll probably do some swimming, some chilling at RadioShack Ontario, and hanging with his awesome parents. I also got my senior pics done today...which I think/hope are gonna turn out really well.The weather was kinda yucky, but we had to work with it, and we did! I cant wait to see the proofs now. So today is also a sad day cause I realized that I only have one month left to get all that homework done!! I've gotta finish like 2 packets for bio, read 2 books and do the work with that, and finish my hist. thing. Yuck! what a way to end the summer....oh well, if I wasnt such a lazy ass then it would already be done. Well, Im out....lol (i always wanted to say that)"

"event","So last night I was at Amanda's house with Lindsay, and we had a GREAT time!! Us speds really know how to party!! LOL. So we went to Wegmans and made complete retards out of ourselves cause we couldnt scoop the candy out of the jar and make it into the bag! Then of course you have to be 18 to get a Wegmans card, so that pissed Amanda off (dont blame you there, we had some good ass movies picked out). So then its after 9 and Im the only one who can drive past then, so i had to drive Amanda's car and was SO nervous cause its different than those hot minivans that Im used to driving. And so we get back to her house, eat, talk with her mom, talk online, ya know the normal girl sleepover stuff. Great times! Us sheds, er speds...lol. It was a fun time-we had girl talks and pigged out (which is all I ever really do anyways). And linds made me cry when she told me i was mean (lol).But thats just a summary of the good time we had together, which we def. have to do again soon!! Anyways, today I have to go to work, at the good ol' Carmine's...hopefully I dont have to walk cause its pouring out! That'll be a fun time too being that the manager always wants to tell me I dont sell enough of those raffle tickets we're trying to sell. Of course, Liz can sell plenty of them, but i can't....oh well.lol. Anyways, Im gonna go get ready for work and all that..."

"event","I had the most insane fuckin' dream just now.

There was a whole really funny part taking place in Target, but this part was just ridiculous.

I was with Lauren Neller and we walked into my school and the gym had collapsed and we had to be really careful about balancing the floor so it didn't cave anymore and so we didn't get hurt. Anyway, we had to slide down this grass track on pillows or something like that and I ended up separated from Lauren, and then insanity began. Everyone was sitting on bleachers and looking over at the school (I think we were looking at Mountainview) and lightening struck the building's windows two at a time three or four times. There were 2 windows that were struck repeatedly and then shattered. We could hear the people there yelling for everyone to get back from the windows. I was so scared I was grabbing the arm of the person next to me even though I didn't know who it was (turned out to be Melissa Weiss). So then it started storming really badly. I was in a van with some people being taken back to school. Lightening was hitting everywhere. Buildings were getting completely destroyed. There was a tv-like thing in the car and it had graphics like on NES and it was a map of the school and it showed how electrified everything was and how buildings just kept sending out random sparks, but they were a lot bigger than sparks, they were like actual shooting bolts. The buildings looked fried. People were talking about how the lightning was brown. (? it's apparently a really bad type of lightning)We were wondering if they were going to end the semester early and send everyone home. (this took place the day before finals start.) We got back to school and I grabbed my jacket out of the trunk and ran into the Union (which looked nothing like the union. hi dreams.) but then realized it wasn't my jacket so I ran back out and the van was gone and they said they would give my jacket back to me when they send vans/cars/buses to take everyone home.

MORAL: scary fucking dream."

"event","So it's been awhile. I don't know if anyone even knows this journal but hey why not get it out. I have to talk to someone, or something right? I was hoping it wouldn't stoop to this. I was hoping I didn't have to write online about how I was feeling.. but I aparently do. I would try to call the friends I have here, but two out of the three of them are the reasons I'm feeling like this lol. Well not the only reason, but a good contributing factor to it. Maybe the loneliness of Seattle is starting to hit me. I can't call someone to go out and get a drink or a cup of coffee, and the friends I do have I bother them because I want to be around them all the time when I'm not working..because that's my life here. I need a new life here aparently.. a life with friends that want to hang out with me. A life with a woman that wants only me. A life where I can call a friend and ask them what they're doing and not have to worry if they think I'm bothering them. Maybe I sound lame with all this pity for myself.. but it's really starting to weigh down on me. If you know me, at all.. then you know one of my biggest insecurities is feeling like a burden. Well, on everyone in Seattle that I seem to see day to do or talk to.. I am. It just makes me want to disapear again.. I would come across the same problem. I just am not good at making friends or not having any. 
Too much time alone isn't good for me
Too much time to think, isn't good for me
Too much time to hate myself, makes me hate myself more and more.. 
ew, sorry about the ranting... if anyone even reads this. I just didn't have anyone to talk to. I still don't..and this didn't help."

"event","Oh man, I'm so tired and a little buzzed and just got the most wonderful present. My gf for our one month posted this entry that made me cry tears of joy for how stoked I am to be with someone like her. She's so amazing. There's no way I could top her post, but if she could only see the eyes I made over it. I miss you baby I'll see you as soon as possible. Thank you so much. I'll top you one day soon muahaha. <9+"

"event","So here I am with another journal. Sorry I keep doing this to you guys so that you always have to add me again but I start new chapters in my life and sometimes they end as soon as they start. I think this chapter of my life will be a long and successful one and this should be a good place to rant about what's been going on in my life now that I've moved to Seattle. I thought Post Logic was fitting because I might call my first book that if I ever write a whole one... and in Carp we call being high post. "" You're post "" as in stuck there... anyway, I'll always have a part of Carp with me, and that's where it all truly began, and now here is where I start a new part... but still post. Always post ;)

So I moved to Seattle. It's grey here a lot. It's okay though, I like grey, a lot, and I don't mind overcast days. I don't mind the rain and I have been distracted by indoors anyway. You can smoke inside the bars here.. and the Denny's. I spend a lot of my time in Issaquah where my gf Darcy lives. I'll post a picture as soon as I can.  -

I miss my friends back home in Carp. I miss my mom too, and my grandparents. I miss the environment, the weather, the fact that everything was under 5 mins away. The beach.. but it's okay because I have things here that I never could have there.. Opportunites, and this wonderful gf. I'm so in love it's disgusting to like, 99% of the people around us. There are the select few who love us enough to appriciate the fact we're happy, but even they can't take the mush some of the time. It's fine with me though, I'll never get sick of having her next to me. Her smell is so familiar and we're so writen in the stars that it's got to be something worth bragging about and showing off. 

I love living with Garth. He's the best roommate someone could have. One of my best best friends living right upstairs? He's a part of home to have here with me too. It's comforting to have someone to say shoal with. I am going to start a painting with him now as we pack the bowl actualy, so I have to go but I love you all, add this journal and wait for pics of cool shit. <3"

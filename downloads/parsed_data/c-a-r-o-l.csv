well nina came over today and we hung out and went for a bike ride and im like nina lets go this way cuz idk y but i felt i had to well i see ed's dog running away and we go try to ctach it and it went across cotton rode by the brige so we r running about 1/2 down but we left our bikes  at the sub so we r runnign with my sandles and nina has her shoes so she got farther

we had to cross the road so we did but we didnt want to get it the dog was running so fast awya from us so we go and the dog alomst got hit like 10 times :/

so we go in this huge field to find him man there was like no hope! but we still try and then we him and but we couldnt catch him and then we lost him and where he was.. then out of no where we see 2 other cats and another baby puppy! we were soo sad for them man  that was bad to see so we tried to catch them but we just couldnt

so we deicded to go back and tell my mom well when we get back in teh sub we see his other dog! man! so we go by it and like corner it and it just sat there so this nieghbor took it home and told ed's mom that her one dog is lost and explain the whole thing while we went home to tel my mom man she was soo mad but we still went back to find him

so on our way back to the field im like lets get greg he can help us so we go get him and then we see ed's mom ed and his brother in there jeep going to go find him so we follow her and all and they go across and im decideing if i should too cuz there was alot of traffic .. but yah i did go across but nina and greg stayed back and called his name and looked to see if he went back the other way..

so me ed and his bro go and look for his dog for about an hour it was hott..so then we went wayy back into the field and ed didnt even have shoes on but yah we got these prickly thing on us that wouldnt come off! but then we thougth we heard him but we didnt but we keep lookin but we heard the cats but didnt see them 


then i go to see if nina and greg r ok and they r but i like almost got hit but they stopped lol thank god but we went back me ed and his bro and look for charlie well i go and jump this like 6 foot fence and there was an abonabone house man it was scary but i look in it but the dog wasnt there and then i jumped back over and we still diddnt find him :/

so i had to leave for the mall with nina and we go back form and i saw a police officer and i told him the story and he went but couldnt find him either so we got home and i got yelled at like crazy for being out of the sub and everything 
but yah i started to cry  0:/ lol .. but i felt awefull

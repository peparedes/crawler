"event","Well, I got off work today so I could play in this volleyball league with Holly...I think we're going to be on different teams.  Gotta register for school...slacking in that area.  Damn.  Doing the laundry for two now...the boyfriend isn't allowed to touch mine because he might fuck some of my clothes (it's been done before that's why).  It's good to finally have him back, but ever time I leave for work he's says he misses me.  It's so sweet...so much to do...better get listening to my rap music so I can clean up the pad too!"

"event","It's been god only knows how many hours since i've had a decent night of sleep...although i tried to sleep on the plane but that never happens.  
much like heather, i need a job, probably worse than she does as i have alienated my parents, but that never handed over the dough anyway.  
hawaii was nice, great tan, but i don't really care much for ohau, but the water was simple magnificent...more blue than any ocean i've ever seen.  
seeing artie again was the best part, naturally...and oddly enough, it wasn't that strange.  he's still the same except he's been holed up in a prison for the past seven months with 17 days of port calls in between.  all of which he got anniliated at.  who can blame the poor boy.  
he's be home for good on the 31st and then we can quit dancing around the computer to talk with each other. 
god i love him."

"event","It's been a bloody long time since I've written in this thing, maybe it's because I've spent most of my time writing to Artie and trying to keep my baby amused (or sane).  
So last night I had a triumph dinner with Ron, who cooked me up some filets with shrooms dipped in a shiraz sauce (we didn't have any marasala--ghetto style!)served with asparagus to celebrate Artie's departure from the Arabian Gulf and homeward bound for our new lover's nest, which I may decorate any way I wish.  
It's a woman's dream!
So after a few glasses and hours later here I am, waiting for work and wondering what the hell it is that I'll have today for lunch--damn diet! 86 the Carbs and pound down the Ripped Fuel because I will lose 15 lbs. 
Better get cracking before my belly eats me body up!  Wheeeeeeeee!"

"event","Today is my first ever entry into livejournal.  Now I am no longer a virgin to this thing.
I need a pedicure....BAD.  I picking at my feet in bed today when I noticed all this dead skin on the bottom and this funky smell emanating from the soles.  UGH!  The past four days my lazy ass finally pulled her shit together and started packing the hours in at Outback again.  I put 25 hours alone there on Friday and Saturday, laughing at bikers (it was biketoberfest this weekend) silly little remarks just so could i whore myself out (figuratively speaking) for an hour or two at their tables to get some big bucks.  it worked too, but after years of experience i shouldn't expect anything less.
so last night i hit Main Street for a long needed night of self obliteration of which i fully achieved spending a mere 20 bones.  anyway, the music played down there is usually reminiscent of the old rock days, but a Full Moon Saloon they had a DJ spinning.  I was like, ""what the fuck"" and as i look around i noticed it was all young kids.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen Bike Week will officially be Generation X and Y's show for years to come.  It was like 600 with the scent of leather everywhere.  
well, i better go hop in the shower and rinse this dye out of my hair before it falls out."

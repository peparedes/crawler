"event","I am in shock. I found out yesterday that Chelsea Koch, a senior at my school, committed suicide last week. She was the most friendly, sweet person you could ever hope to meet, and of all the people I've known, she would be the last person I would imagine would die so soon. At school today in most of my classes we sat mostly in silence, many people including me crying. I didn't even know her that well, but the fact that someone our age, with their whole life ahead of them, is gone is so sad. The whole school is grieving, and I am afriad she thought no one would care. Oh, Chelsea, that's never true. Please, anyone who reads this, never even begin to consider such an option. There's always someone who cares about you. There's always something to live for."

All I have to say is that whenever I thought of updating this, it was either thre middle of the night, where I didn't like such random thoughts, or when I was fighting off the wild boars. Those pesky boars. Anyway, school started for me last week- no, the week before that. The 17th, whenever that was. It's actually gonna be pretty good, I thikn. I got classes like Film History, Library Aide, Latin 1- the only real classes I have are AP European History paired with AP English. Bleh. Well, Euro should be cool cos the teacher is like the best person in the world, but I'm not sure about English. We'll see. On a more personal note, my bf and I are going through some interesting times. Not bad, you undersatnd, oh no, but simply- interesting. It also sucks that we have no classes together, so we only see each other at lunch, and occasionally after school. And weekends of course. Oh no, can't forget those."

Well I do apologize for not updating recently: life is crazy. Let's see, recently I went to Charleston, SC for a week to lie on the beack. It was most fun. Than I discovered when I got back that absence truly does make the heart grow fonder. That's all I'll say about THAT! Well, yesterday I saw a movie called ""Millions"" -about two English boys who find a million pounds. It was fairly good, but after a while it got way to heart warming. I wanted to punch one of the little boys for being so self-righteous. Well, my... second cousins are here at the moment, so I have to be sociable. Toodles!"

Now I must admit that about .3% of the pictures I'm printing are blue, so it's fine. But for the other 99.7%, it's irritating as HELL! So yes.

Then I heard the boy get up ,and come back a few minutes later. I asked where he'd been, and he said that he had gotten a drink of water. So we started whispering some more, then went up to the living room so we wouldn't wake anyone up. So we sat there for a while... not sure how long. Then we both started to get tired, and he rested his head on my shoulder, and I think he started to fall asleep. But then he sat up again, and I leaned back on the couch, and he rested his head on my stomach. Eventually, he fell asleep, but I couldn't. First of all, I was sitting up, so it's hard to fall asleep like that. Second of all, there was a boy laying on me- that's a bit distacting. So I ended up moving to another couch and sleeping there. (Of course nothing else happened, you dirty children!) The next day, we all walked to church- yay. But he didn't have any socks so he this nasty blister and was walking really slowly. Eventually we couldn't see the other people- which was bad, because neither of us knew how to get to church. At church, we did such boring churchly things such as him trying to tickle me, and having me be his pet cat... normal church things, like I said! ...that's why I'm tired!"

"event","So yeah. Yesterday I went to a 'shindig on the green'. At it, my sister (who was visiting) and I went to the front to square dance with everyone else, but this maybe 80-year-old guy took me as a partner and scared me. Meh! He creeped me out, and I tried to go back to my sister, but I couldn't. It was frightening. But I feel like a terrible person, on a totally different subject. So, girl from Ukarine (remember me talking about her?) invited me to her birthday party on Thursay. For some reason, I thought it was Saturday, so I obviously didn't go. the next day she said that she was really sad I hadn't come, and she had left some messages on my answering machine. When I checked them, she said that she really hoped I was coming, and she was waiting for me. God, I feel horrible. This is a terrible way to start a school year. I mean, I'm assuming she's gotten over it, but still. How dare I?

"event","Wow. That's all I have to say. There's no way of putting how I feel right now, but I guess it's good. I was talking to this boy in my English class- he looks- ah, how do I put this kindly?- like, he's not the brightest crayon in the box. Missing a few wheels, or whatever- you know? But yeah, so I was talking to him, and we got on the subject of Lord of the Rings! (i mean, this is Meredith talking, of course it was LOTR) and he said that he loved it, and we became the best of buddies! Well, maybe that's a BIT of an exaggeration, but it was fun. Wow. Then my bus was a half an hour late. That was fun, and I talked to some kids on my bus who are sohpmores, but looked maybe 12. Did we look like that? I don't think so- I hope not. Then I went home *sigh*. I need to talk to people personally to explain that!"

"event","Yay! This has been a most pleasant day. I mean, in orchestra we played a song from Phantom of the Opera! I mean, how cool can you get? And I met this kid who plays violin who is like my ka. For those of you who don't know Egyptian mythology, your ka is your double, the same person as you. It's wonderful. ANYway, then I got my summer reading quiz back in English and I got 100! Huzzah! I am smart! Well, I mean the test was really easy, but that's irrelevant. And in English class I was working on a story of mine, and this girl was like ""wow, you're writing a story? Thats so cool!"" like I was doing some trick or something. Then she was watching me write. It was kind of scary. Ah well. Now tommorow some people from France are coming to my house, then on Sunday I'll see my new Ukranian friend! Yay! Asheville isn't so bad after all, I guess."

"event","So now school is being a bit nicer. I met someone today who likes Lord of the Rings, so all is well. I'm also talking to this girl who I only see while we're waiting for the bus. But it's funny, today, I was practically spilling my life's story to her. It was funny, but apparently she didn't mind. then again, maybe she's planning to kill me. You never know. To change the subject, if all boys in Ukraine are like the ones my new friend was telling me about, I want to live there. She was saying how they would write love letters to her, and songs, and a SONNET! Then again, she's really pretty and charming and such, so it's not that surprising. *sigh* Ha ha, yeah. I'll just stay odd and chicken. Huzzah!"

"event","Oh wow. I just came back from my first day at Asheville High. It's SO HARD when you don't know anyone. Wow. So often I'd find myself talking to random people who looked nice. And I ate lunch in the stadium with this girl from Ukraine. Wow that sounds strange. But we couldn't find the cafeteria! In my English class, we had a quiz on our summer reading, and I thikn I was maybe one of 5 in a class of about 28 that had actually read the book. But it was kind of funny seeing what people had written. And I saw someone that looked EXACTLY like this kid from East, except with a different haircut. But it was really scary. Now I have to go find some pill bugs for my AP Environmental Science class. Strange homework, huh?"

And  I have this crazy English teacher who apparently is going to give us a quiz on our summer reading on the first day. Agh! Yea, pity me for I am like to die. Agh!"

"event","I went to this Appalachia concert-type thing. It was incredible- I felt like I had gone back in time to an entirely different world. But it wasn't a bad thing. The South has such a strong cultrue. If you asked someone from Wisconsin what our culture is, after a pause they might say something like ""...Cheese?"" even though that isn't REALLY our culture. But it's so amazing to see old people here who have been playing the 'fiddle' or the banjo, etc. all their life, and to see their children continuing the tradition.
Also, there was this man sitting behind me who, whenever any of the performers would play some sort of instrument, he would say ""good pickin'"", sometimes many time within the same song. He'd also interject that with ""num num!"" which I suppose is ""yum yum"", meaning ""they're good enough to eat""... or something like that. I really don't know. It was amusing at first, but he would say it SO MUCH, during EVERY SONG, and he'd say it loud enough for everyone around him to hear it. Ah well."

"event","First off i must give major props to ms jennifer young and her remarkable post a few days ago. I've really enjoyed posting my thoughts and seeing everyone elses thoughts...although i might add that no one has really countered her or anyone elses opinons.  Dont be shy...you can comment if you dont agree...unless you're gonna be immature about it...then dont bother.  But this post is my post letting you all know that im sticking to my beliefs...and i dont care what others think. I believe in God and im a christian.  that doesnt mean im perfect though.  I mess up just like everyone else. I used to be afraid to admit that cause i thought i would be considered a ""bad christian""..but i realized that everyone makes mistakes. I also realized that i shouldnt take things lying down. Even if im only one person..i can make an impact on this world and thanks to jenns post...i started thinking.

I think our youth has been corrupted from all the things going on in our world today.  ""Its cool to lose your virginity when you're 13 and to get high during school just to prove that you can get away with it."" ""Drinking until you're too messed up to walk or even get up is a great way to spend your weekend""  Im sorry but i dont agree with any of this. Teens of today need to stop and think of what their worth is to this world. There are no boundaries...no limits to our lives except for those that are put there personally.  You are in charge of your own life. Not your parents...not your friends..you.  Sure your parents have rules...but its your choice if you drink...its your choice if you smoke..its your choice when you want to have sex...its your choice to what extent you want to live your life and what possibilities you want to have. The popular things in this world are what we make popular.  We have the vote and we have the say. So what do we do about it? If we dont agree about what everyone thinks is the ""cool"" thing to do then we dont speak up? I dont think so! I want a movement people.  I dont want empty promises. I dont want you to agree with me and not do anything about it. Im putting my name down...right here right now...because i want everyone to know that i dont agree and i want a change.  If you want to make that statement too...comment with your name.  You dont have to put anything else if you wouldnt like to. Make your name a declaration of where you want to stand in todays world.

I want to make a difference.

"event","Gianna~ I've never had a best friend like you before.  There are hardly words to describe it. You have been there for me through thick and thin and have sacrificed for my happiness...and then was there to console me when it bit me in the butt.  You are my one true soul mate...and all i have to say is: hairy bob...spit lollipop...bob & harrys

Theresa~ You are such an amazing friend...always pushing me to be a better Christian.  There have been times where I've completely wanted to give up but just seeing your passion for God has rejuvinated me and made me want to be better. I love you so much and don't ever change.

David~ I'm so glad that you and I have become such good friends.  I love talking with you and laughing about how you're browner than other people :-p but I'm also glad to have you as someone to talk to and someone that I know will be there for me no matter what.  I love arguing with you and neither of us winning.  I hope we become even better friends.

Nick~ You're like my second brother. From taking baths together when we were tiny little kids (you know you all are jealous) to going to Warren together and eventually being at eachother's weddings...you and I have always been there for eachother. I know sometimes we fight but I love you so much and I always will.  I'm here for you no matter what and I know that you will be there for me.  You're my best friend til the end.

Bethany~ I love you so much and I want to thank you for being so awesome to me and to everyone else.  You are such a beautiful person, inside and out, and God has some
thing major in store for you. You have such an awesome voice, the voice of an angel, and you will go far with it.

Kristin~ Crib babies til the frickin end!  We have so many memories together and I cherish every single one of them.  I love how easy you are to talk to and how I know that whatever I tell you will stay with you.  Thanks for always understanding me and for being so excited about me coming to Warren.  You make me feel so wanted :-)

Jen. P~ I am soo freaking glad that we became friends!!  Right from the very start I knew that I could trust you and know that you wouldn't ever judge me.  I love how much we have in common and how extremely easy it is to talk to you. I <3 you soo much and I can't wait to see how strong our friendship is going to be.

Jen. Young~ You are my #1 dancing buddy and without you...my lunch would be so extremely boring.  I love your laugh and how you just seem to make everything in life humurous.  I'm so glad that you and I didn't follow everyone out of the movie that one day...we are our own person ;-)  You have such an amazing spirit and I envy it.

Niall~ Wow we have had some of the longest and most random conversations ever!  I'm going to miss you so much when you move but I will never ever forget all our long talks.  You better come down to visit us ALOT!   You are such a great guy with so many wonderful qualities and you are such an awesome guitarist.  Thanks for always listening, :-)

And to everyone else who I didnt put...just leave a comment and I'll write about you...I would have said more about other people but I'm really tired and gonna go to bed. comment!"

The glory of friendship is not the outstretched hand, nor the kindly smile nor the joy of companionship; it is the spiritual inspiration that comes to one when he discovers that someone else believes in him and is willing to trust him.

    i love God. i love Jesus. i love my friends. i love life. and i love my family.  i've really loved the past two burns...kudos to mike too.  yay for pastors.  last weeks burn really spoke to me...i've discovered in the last year that i have a really hard time trusting people.  it was strange because right before that burn i was having a really hard time with just the sense of not being able to trust people and then mike spoke on it and i just realized that i need to open up and trust people.  but this is a two way thing. please if you're my friend...even if you're just an aquaintance...dont ever lie to me or do anything to ruin my trust for you.  this is my declaration that im starting over and trusting everyone...fresh start.  so please dont do anything to break that trust...for your sake and mine.

God bless you all :-D

1. read my bible every day even if it's just a few verses
2. STOP GOSSIPING
3. listen to music and watch movies that will be pleasing to God and will not fill my mind with trash
4. stop downloading music because it really is like stealing
5. stop saying ""crap"" because i know that there are more intelligent words to use
6. help get rid of any cliques at church
7. and lastly stop judging people

if any of you see me slip up then please please confront me...s.l.a.p. me around a lil ;-)

cameron left for texas today. yesterday i got to spend some time with him which was cool...even though i was being really stupid for most of the time...but im glad that i finally started thinking straight and managed not to ruin his last night. but it really was a lot of fun.  we went to cams house at 11 and stayed there for about an hour and had the best time of the day. we were all crackin up and it was a great way to spend our last hour with him until thanksgiving vacation. omgosh he suprised me today by calling me from texas and that made me feel a lot better...he was laughin with a lot of the other guys so that made me happy that hes having a good time.

so all in all i've had an unexplainably mind bending, soul changing, spiritually lifting week.  i leave for cabo tuesday morning...so please pray for the cabo team and mission! im gonna miss you guys.  alright im pretty much done here...but theres one last thing i want to say: remember to talk to God you guys...i had forgotten this but i finally remembered that He is the best listener there will ever be...and He looks forward to talking and listening to you. God bless you all!

always

"event","yesterday was sooo much fun for me.  my mom woke me up to go to x country by my legs were freaking sore so I just stayed home.  i was gonna leave practice early anyway to go out to eat breakfast with cameron, david, and lindsey so it didn't really matter that much.  but yea, the four of us went out to eat at 9:30 cause the boys had summer school.  me and lindsey got to bakers square like 15 minutes late but no one was even hungry so we just kinda sat there...and then the boys would start laughing cause there were really weird silences and that would get me and lindsey laughing.  cameron ended up getting cheesecake and david and lindsey created a very interesting new kind of water...which no one would drink.  it was still fun though.  when we were getting ready to leave cameron said that he had no money to pay for his food so then david told lindsey that we were gonna leave without paying and she actually started to leave! hahahaha it was funny. me and lindsey left..cause we only drank water so we didnt owe anything...and it turned out that cam did have money so we all just went to apollo park after that. ummm...we stayed there for a little then the guys had to go to school so me and lindsey walked to her house. its amazing what two girls can do with rice a roni and hi-c straws.  and lindsey learned that when you dont use oven mits and decide to touch a 450 degree pan...it kinda hurts. hahaha love you lindsey.  after that we watched zoolander then i went out to lunch with theresa, nick, and nathan.  lindsey couldnt go because she had to get a new bed...what a whore..getting rid of your old bed how dare you. :-p just kidding lindsey...i'm not that obsessive. and then finally after all that was our last BURN @ THE BEACH!! it was freakin cold but it was still fun.  me gianna ryan and kelly all watched the sunset. aww it was prettiful. on the way home cameron formed his new little fan club full of 10 year olds...and managed to cock block at the same time;-) after that i went home...got a little sad...but i'm over it now...all it takes is a good nights sleep.  no way im gonna go back into stupid little moods...its not worth it. Tomorrow i'm gonna go to the beach with gianna, cameron, and ryan...ryan's gonna teach me and gig how to surf! so that should be fun. that's about it. i'll update whenever i have more to tell. love ya"

"event","Man I haven't updated this in a while.  I tried to while I was in Arizona but then the browser closed and i didn't want to start all over...i hate it when that happens. But yea life is pretty good.  I'm finally out of the depressed mode crap. I'm not sure what that was but I'm glad it's over. Umm...last week was just kinda whatever.  I went to Burn @ the beach and actually went in the water this time with Lindsey and Ryan.. i freaking love them.  Lindsey and I are going to take over the world...you just watch us. I hung out a bit with cameron, ryan, lindsey, and david o... he's pretty cool...him and cameron are both weirdos sometimes but they're cool. Yea, our last Burn @ the beach is tomorrow...cause next week is CIY!!!! I'm so excited about that.  It's gonna be FRIGGIN AWESOME!

This weekend was fun. my family and i went to arizona to see my cousins and i got to play with my cousins 2 1/2 year old boy all weekend.  he's so talkative but its funny cause he babbles on about nothing.  Him and I got to play in the snow cause they had a snow day for the kids at the park and that is an awesome way to cool off in 110 degree weather.

Today I went to church to put little address stickers on post cards that we're sending out for the cabo fundraiser movie night.  You all better go!!!! I'll hunt you down and kill you if you don't.  When I was at church mike beat me up...i cant remember why but he did.  Luckily I don't bruise easily..or that fool would be sued.  He gave me a dead leg and started beating on my arm because I said he hit like a woman...hahahaha...he still does.  I almost had him begging for mercy though cause i took his plastic usc helmet off his desk and was threatening to smash it.  He almost cried.  hahahaha not really but it was still funny.

I can't wait to go to warren.  I'm startin to become good friends with veronica...she's totally awesome.  Lindsey you better go to warren!!  i'll hit your coochie if you dont!! Yea and it sucks too cause i won't get to go to school with cameron...thats dumb :-/  i'm gonna miss you so much cam.
But yea...I think i'm done for this entry...i'll update after the beach tomorrow. love ya

"event","These past few days have been ok I guess.  Wednesday was Burn @ the beach which was a lot of fun.  I can't wait for Burn @ the beach this week...I'll prolly go in the water if the weather is any warmer.  Thursday I didn't really do anything and Friday Gianna came over to spend the night.  We watched The Bourne Identity and Notting Hill...awwww.  Theresa and Sam rollerbladed to my house today! I love them so much.  Oh and it was cool this week because I got to ""bond"" with Veronica!  She's awesome...I love her too.  We talked about what we're both goin through and she understands me 100%!!  I can't wait to form all these new friendships next year...and hopefully make the ones that I already have stronger.  

I really didn't want to be at home today.  I need to start finding things to do before I go crazy.  If anyone has any ideas let me know!

"event","<P>Ok...I just got back from seeing <U>The Notebook</U> with three of my FAVORITE girls: Dani, Theresa, and Gianna.&nbsp; I freakin love them.&nbsp; Before we went to see that, we went to Mimi's and had breakfast while having our little accountability time which is always cool to have.&nbsp; So yea..and then we went to see the notebook.&nbsp; I freaking hate those movies because you love them while hating them.&nbsp; It's such a confusing emotion. Just like guys...you really really hate them but you can't help loving them.&nbsp; But it was really good.&nbsp; I didn't cry like I thought I would...but that's ok because I hate crying in movies...it's such a girl thing to do.&nbsp; Yes I know I'm&nbsp;a girl but girl emotions drive me crazy sometimes.&nbsp; Aww and I got to see Sammy and Alex!! I love them so much.&nbsp; I'm gonna miss them next year.&nbsp; Stupid Alex is moving...dorkface.&nbsp; Today was ok...I still feel kinda meh...like I have been for the last like 3 weeks...but I think it's gettin better.&nbsp; Oh yea and if anyone has any suggestions to a company I could send a sponsorship letter to for my missions trip to Cabo...let me know!!&nbsp; I'm off.</P>

"event","<P><FONT size=2>So yea...I have a lj now.&nbsp; What's the world coming to?&nbsp; Anyways...today was actually alright.&nbsp; My mom woke me up and made me breakfast...but she let me sleep in to so it was frickin awesome.&nbsp; And then I finished reading a book by Nicholas Sparks.&nbsp; That mans a freaking genious when it comes to writing romantic books.&nbsp; He knows his crap.&nbsp; The only bad thing is that once you read one of his books...you always want that to happen to you...unless its A Walk to Remember...cause then you would die really young and I don't think people want that.&nbsp; But yea so that was cool.&nbsp; Then I went to a bible study and after I went to Jack in the Box with Nick, Kristin, and Gigi.&nbsp; hahahaha that was fun.&nbsp; Kristin's pannido was cold and she didn't want to go get a new one...but finally Gianna went with her and then when Kristin got&nbsp;a new one the guy confused her by saying that the bread was warm but the meat wasnt or something...whatever.&nbsp; You know the strawberry fanta tastes like melted cherry icee? It's kinda gross.&nbsp; So after that Timmy came and ate with us randomly...after we yelled his name for five minutes...and then he finally acknowledged our presence...how kind of him lol.&nbsp; Then we went to Kristin's house and watched family guy..which I had NEVER seen before.&nbsp; It's great though.&nbsp; Umm yea so that was pretty much my day.&nbsp; I'm sure I'll have more exciting stuff to put tomorrow.&nbsp; Lates.</FONT></P>

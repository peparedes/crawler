"event","Let me just start by saying this. &quot;Was it wrong for me to let you down this easy narrow path or should I&nbsp;taken you the long and painful path?&quot; Its true, most people find it that they should grab the closest thing they can get easier rather than going off somewhere blindly not knowing what lies ahead. Something I've done before. I decided to reach for the nearest hand and grab onto it knowing that maybe it could save me....or end me. It ended up with me hurting and suffering much more deeply than I thought. A&nbsp;lesson I&nbsp;learned dearly. I&nbsp;struggled so hard to stand up and focus whats ahead of me but I was so blinded. 

Of course, there were other helping hands that give me the push i needed. Many of them tainted with their own illusions and suffering which I've seen and felt. But it wasn't enough. For those days, I screamed and tried to search where I&nbsp;was going. But only one person helped me. As much as it sounds crazy but it was someone who I never expected. Me. Look down and gave me this look like he was ashamed. But I&nbsp;remember how he helped pick me up and carry me the rest of the way. Amazing how much I've gone through and what hellish things I've done to myself and how much pain I inflicted to escape the reality of it all and live a pity life. Yet, here stands this other me. Carrying me through and showing determination and courage. Reminded me something of what I&nbsp;wanted to be as a kid. The one who was always afraid of everything but still stood up to those bullies and endure the hatred and beatings. A&nbsp;hero, a goddamn hero.&nbsp;

So basically, at this point you think I've lost it and just don;t make sense. You don't have to really. Or maybe you do but just don't get the complete message? I&nbsp;still struggle and think what would've happened if I kept going the wrong way. I&nbsp;struggle on the past and indulge myself in the idea of a perfect world. But I&nbsp;can't forget...never.&nbsp;It went to the point where I&nbsp;had to teach myself. That I&nbsp;had to face it, headstrong. One of those battles where you just need to fight it alone. Thank god I cried that day.....and thank you for showing me the correct way to live and show me where to lead. So now my dear friend, its your turn. Its your turn to look beyond those eyes and force them out. 


if not then, all hope is lost. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; This is some crazy medication I'm taking."

"event","I&nbsp;believe this is more like my storage, so later on I can look back and see. Annie Mac has become one of the people that I've been listening to a lot lately. One of the top DJ's I&nbsp;look up to nowadays for inspiration!&nbsp;Though DJ&nbsp;AM&nbsp;is really one I&nbsp;looked forward meeting, since he opened a club in NJ but with his passing...well yeah. Anyways, I&nbsp;would like to introduce Annie Mac. She took over Pete Tong spot in the BBC&nbsp;radio. heres her profile I nabbed from her site <br /><br /><p>Born and bred in Dublin to a family immersed in musicality, Annie left home at 17 to attend Queens University in Belfast, where she was bitten by the clubbing bug after visiting the city's legendary Shine club nights. Inspired to purchase her first set of decks, Annie taught herself to mix using old funk and soul records bought from local charity shops. Following a stint as part of Shine's marketing team and four months living in Manhattan, Annie made the move to London, working simultaneously as a TV and Radio plugger, a freelance Broadcasting Assistant and a presenter for the SBN, before she approached Radio 1. Initially employed as a BA, her natural flair got her noticed by management and she was soon standing in for Mary Anne Hobbs.</p>  <p>Annie's show on Radio 1 began in July 2004, when, working as a assistant producer on Zane Lowe's show, she impressed Radio 1 bosses with her demos and her determination.</p>  <p>Since then her show has gone from strength to strength. Annie Mac's show on Friday nights on Radio 1 has attracted a host of loyal followers from around the world and sees her play the cutting-edge dance music which she has become known for. Annie has established herself firmly as part of Radio 1's specialist output.</p>  <p>Annie is also a talented club DJ and is booked regularly to play the UKs most credible clubs. Annie has just completed her annual DJ tour 'Annie Mac Presents' which she has hosted for 3 years running. Annie personally chooses the line-up of DJs for her tour, both established and up-and-coming to play in her favourite clubs across the UK. 2009 has seen Annie DJ at more festivals than ever, plus regular dates in Ibiza and around the world.</p>  <p>Her TV work has seen Annie contribute regularly to BBC2's The Culture show, reviewing new music releases. She has also done work for MTV2 presenting 'Gonzo'. In October 2007 Annie helped launch BBC Switch, the BBC's offering for 12-16 year olds. It was announced that Annie would front Switch, a brand new Sunday night Radio 1 show, and co-host a new weekly music TV show 'Sound' alongside Nick Grimshaw on BBC2 every Saturday afternoon.</p>  <p>Since her show began, Annie has gone from strength to strength, her show becoming part of the audio fabric of the nation on a Friday night. From the end of September 2009, Annie began to host the prestigious Friday night 7-9pm slot, taking over from the legend that is Pete Tong. She also continues to co-present Switch with Nick Grimshaw on Sundays from 7-10pm.<br /><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I would like to say reading that and seeing how much communication is involved Im re-thinking of what to do. As much as Im being slacked off doing my music and DJing...with all this emotional stuff and not being in check, I&nbsp;believe its time for me to spend the money on the shit I&nbsp;really need. Enough music, enough time to show off. I&nbsp;just need a partner to motivate and listen to my mess ups :)</p>"

"event","Well with having some time off, I decided to take care of the side project i was trying to put together before school finished. So far I&nbsp;have 9 songs, freshly edited and mixed. Not done with it since I would like to add some effects but I would also like to add more music to it. 


Hopefully it is as good as the first one since the first CD&nbsp;i did was a bit..more hardcore dance stuff. I decided to be a little soft on the music and do music that you (hopefully) would hear on the radio. Did a whole lot of research on music and came to some really good music that i never heard before. Although some songs I'm sure you all heard of it before but doesn't hurt to listen to it again. 

Some of you I&nbsp;understand like to listen to the choices of the music i pick to play and mix but I&nbsp;hope I&nbsp;don't disappointed since I&nbsp;decided to take a different route with it.  Then again, while I'm writing this, I have the mix playing and im already cringing at some things. Wish I had better programs sometimes or some experience. 

Although, I'm amazed how far I came with music inspiration. Should go into the musical major than anything but they dont make enough dinero.
Its like I&nbsp;told that one DJ&nbsp;i met at school, I&nbsp;wish to be known in the DJ&nbsp;business. Doesn't hurt to dream like that.&nbsp;

Anyways, I'm debating if I&nbsp;should pre-release a demo but I&nbsp;really finish it or have someone listen to it. With all these great songs, its a bitch to have the music in the right tempo but im still learning. Hell, i recently got to the edit this 7min long song into 3min, matching up its beat. 


Wish I could post my music on live stream.....would be great!"

"event","My third Demo of my music complete. Finally, I can give myself a break from that awful project. I don't like it because one, I couldnt burn the CD right even though I learned making an 80min mix is better than an hour and 2 min one. Two, well the music I picked, not sure some people out there will like it. I went to Hardcore Dance to House music. I wanted to give the listener samples of each music that I like to play rather than one type and thats all. Most DJ's do it, and I understand they do it because they play music for that specific group. I know once I start breaking into the turntable era, I would like to play a variety of music that people can dance and dance....then have that song stuck in their head for months. Usually what happens when I listen to music, i think about what people would feel when they hear this song, would they like it? would they dance to it? Some people, its just music to them. just one looped dance beat and vocals added to it. Sure, i view some trance music like that, but I find music that gives you the feeling to bust a move and dance until your heart gives out and people start crying. 

What I found out that most music I really really listen to is House. Well, lately i've been listening to that type more than anything. Esp. Vocal House. Its where 'I Watch You' 'Call on Me' 'Pjanoo' came from. Most of my fav DJ's are House players. Although like me and most DJ's we jump around in the music pool. 

Meh, it makes me wish I could just put money into cart's and the Serato Scratch Live to play and build a career. Seriously, I would love to be invited to play for a party and have people just cheer and shout for more music. Thats what I imagine seeing most of the time when I play music. Just look away from the turntables and see how much people just go along with the music. Gives me the shivers. Now that I think of it, I should just change my major and go with the music industry. Would help me alot in understanding that BIG equipment they use to make CD's. 

Damn my gamer side. 

Also, if I start playing for places, it would shut me up about how I want to play and be good and give Kim a rest with me complaining. 


Anyways, Demo 3 is finished. Im already planning on making a 4th one. I got some music down for it. But i have a question! Does making music like this make me a a Dj already? like am I considered a Dj for doing mixes or do I have to at least play at a place or know how to use a turntable?

I ask myself alot lately. Just wish I could be considered one finally, rather some kid tweaking music."

Of course at work, I minded my own business and was happy. Going to leave when the person who takes my place asks me this question ""Am I this person's bitch?"" I respond with a laugh and count my drawer out because I, for one, can careless what people say to me unless they really get to me. Thus my coworker calling me asshole (great) and me thinking, ""Well...I just found out something. People can go to the extreme of telling others what peoples opinions are"". I'm not mad at this ""person"" but say, very fucking disappointed. The fact that I joked around and said words that, yes, can piss a person off but how you told that person what I said. 

""Its what you get"" Of course, I know these consequences but it shouldn't have this far. Tell you what, I'm much more of an asshole than I was before. But this, I feel like this was a betrayal. A way to get back at me for joking around but making it seem like a real deal to you. I feel...well, fake towards you now. Please insist of saying how this is all of my fault. How I shouldn't say those words.

I tend to stand back and watch whats going on and at work...theres alot of shit that I hate. Like for example, when you work with a certain someone and they are like ""Oh can you do this, while I just play the scratch off's"" What the fuck? I do all the work and if i were to fuck up, aww shit, they start complaining how things arent done or how im too tired to do anything. Shit, lady. I can't just quit though, i need money for school and personal needs but this shit needs to end. By that I mean, get a different job where i don't have to listen about backstabbing bitches and how they can fuck up your work hours and how im not good enough because I dont have a fucking vagina! Who gives a shit. People make it seem like its such a serious job and we have to do it while all order and we cant be fucking around. Serious? I work at a fucking gas station. When the fuck do I take things serious? Sure, when a person drives off with gas or when a customer comes in and complains how gas is leaking or how this doesnt work, blah blah blah. But you gotta be fucking kidding me when work isnt done and I say I would like to stay and help but NOOOOOOOoo, I cant because im done now. But then keep bitching how things aren't done. What the fuck. Like I said, the only reason Im around is because I need the cash. Fuck man.

All the good sound equipment and mixers and CD-J's, it was like being in KB Toys as a kid, like back in the day. Anyways, I talked to the guy at the desk, asked him some questions about my mixer and he told me they require a very specific voltage for it to work. Meh, makes sense why it didnt work at Radio Shack with Universal A/C. I talked to him more and more and I asked him where I could get 12"" records. He asked me what kind of music i liked, and I told him i was into the whole techno, house dance music. ""Nope"" he said.

Basically you cant find any good record stores anymore in philly or around here. they've been closing down. Like the good ones, which is shit. Well, he was explaining how hard it was and I told him I didnt feel like paying a shit load for S&H for records in the UK. Apparently, most people are into hip-hop and rap stuff these days. And prefer to go with CD stuff. 

CD - Vinyls You see those are two different things. CD's are more commonly used these days because, shit, stores are packed with CD's. Vinyls are really hard. They barely make them around here. In the US, that is from what I gather. I told him i prefer the ol' fashion way to be a DJ. He agreed. Totally agreed. Its easier in a way to use a turntable than a CD-J. But one thing got to me. 

""Its hard man, but don't give up. You are now one of the last pioneers"" This guy was also a DJ. Also a DJ who plays Vinyls. Sweet. He cheered me up in a way. Not to give up and all. But he showed me this cool toy for DJ's. VERY VERY COOL.

I mean, everyone has their dream and such but im sure you read on how I want to be a DJ. If I ever become well-known, well shit, bonus points for me. Well two days ago, I came across this video of this guy doing a techminmix. I was curious on how it would sound and the guy did a good job. Didnt falter&nbsp; or anything, mixed very good. Thus, this inspired me to search up stuff and how start out. Basically, it looks like I need four things really.<br /><br />-DJ Turntables<br />-Mixer<br />-Cartridges<br />-skill<br /><br />Practice makes perfect but I was searching online for the equipment. Pricey, which I knew it would be. But damn pricey. I remember what I read on the basic of doing this stuff, if you want the highest quality, then be ready to pay with the highest price. Jesus, 1k for one turntable. Anyways, I came across on Package deals. I found this <a href=""http://www.audiolines.com/Gemini-MixMaster-5.0-p-16457.html"">DJ Package</a><br /><br />I need your help, should I get it or save money for something else. Eh?! <br /><br /><br />------<br /><br />Well the link I posted, I found out it costed a shit load, Forgot about S&amp;H. SO I figured to check out eBay. I found this awesome starter set. Like a set for someone with a alot of money. I mean, alot. <br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i19.ebayimg.com/04/i/000/f3/d1/53eb_1.JPG"" /><br /><br />so hello to my new friend. I won the bid on eBay. costed me total of 185$. I bet 150. but with S&amp;H, it got me high. But, i did my research to see if this good quality, found out it cost around 399-410$. What a fucking deal. The only thing I asked the guy what kind of head pieces have to go with the turntables, he said anything so I have to find those soon. but yeah, this is the beginning of something i've been dreaming of doing for a great great long long time time! VERY LONG TIME!! I will admit I will be noobish on how to work this and how to mix but practicing makes perfect, right? I'm fucking happy. Really damn happy. At least I didn't spend 400-some dollars on a cellphone. Hehe. <br /><br />Also Kim's birthday on Friday, Kev's this Wednesdays, and grandpa's on Sunday. Jesus.<br /><b></b>"

And of course, my grandfather just laughs and thinks hes joking. And my mother, who sits there and stays quiet or laughs along. Of course, you probably see this as some joke and just say ""Shut up, you had it coming"". Well the reason why I write this now is because of this.

The kids, as troublemakers as they are, decided to play in the kitchen, being loud and all. I was a bit hungry for a snack and so, I went to the fridge to get something. Now I was closing the door, Lex was sniffing and my little brother backs up and slams the door on my dog's nose. My first reaction was ""What the fuck?!"" and I scolded him and checked out my dog to see if he was alright. I didn't mean to scold him that hard but he starts tearing up. My step dad seeing this, goes to him and starts yelling ""Don't cry, its okay"" Then kicks my dog and screams at him. My reaction kicked into anger. I yelled why he&nbsp; had to go and kick my dog. ""Fuck that dog, fucking dog!"" But why I asked, what did he ever do to you? It was me who scolded eddy. ""BECAUSE I FELT LIKE IT!"" 

This is why I am mad. I laughed at him and he got really pissed off. I never stood up to him like that but I laughed. How low is that? Lex was scared when he kicked him and Lex knows when hes in trouble but it came outta no where. But I stood there and laughed. ""What? What?!"" he kept saying. I just shrugged it off and did that whole psssttt sound. I just left everything, and came up to my room. 

My parents beg me to stop fighting with him. I admit sometimes that I create the problem, but theres other ways of avoiding harming people or pets. Sigh, I hate seeing my dog getting treated like that. I take care of him, I take him to get checked out. I see him as my buddy. Fucking pisses me off. And they beg me to just stop fighting and let it go. Bah! Its not right. My old sister gets treated like shit sometimes and I can't step because he has that whole ""Its not my business"" when clearly, shes crying, hes screaming and hitting her, the fuck its not my business. 

I need an apartment. Or a vacation. Or to just tune him out again. Or get people to team up with me and get a place. Or just lie down and drown myself in music. I hate this part of life."

"event","I know back in school, I used to say I always wanted to be this, or that. Stuff I dreamed then made fun of. Of course, its some moronic daydream and people instigating that I'm bullshitting. Well yeah, I would go off and say something then people would just stare at me and just laugh. Usually, I just joke around it but they never let it go. What I get for opening my yap. Then again, I mean to be funny in some humorous way. <br /><br />Well for one dream, even as a kid when my mom used to work at the Mt. Kisco Holiday Inn, (in New York), she used to work for Coat check during the dance and parties. They always played the good shit. The music I probably have downloaded on my iTunes. Music (dance type more like it) that made me want to go in and dance with them. Although, at that age, I never knew that they were for private parties or open. I would just try to go in and watch people dance their ass off. Music. I always been a fan of music. I mean, I fall into different sorts of music but when it comes to music which makes you dance, like ignore everyone else and just feel the beat. Now, I'm not ripping this off from some movie or book or anything. I'm telling you how I feel when I see things like this. I'm sure all of you, my readers, have felt this in some way. Well mine comes from music mostly. <br /><br />So, when my mother worked, she wouldn't let me go far into the party since I wasn't invited and I was a minor. But hell, the music, it really made me dance. So one day, I decided to go in during this little break they were having. Thats when I saw it. The equipment. The DJ equipment that produce such beats. I was curious and decided to go on ahead and ask. Sure enough, the DJ looked at me weird but I looked at the equipment and eyed it. The DJ kinda ignored me but at the same time showed how things run. Man, I can't stop saying that I have this huge passion for dance music. I mean theres rock, country, R&amp;B, etc. But when it comes to Dance, Techno, Trance, the motion of the song, ugh it makes me want to jump out of my skin. Don't get me wrong, Mixing music to make into one hot dance song, its like god giving you a Sin free card.<br /><br />So you're probably like ""So..you love music? Who doesn't these days?!"" or ""So, you want to be some sort of DJ"". As much you want to hold against me, yes, since that childhood till now, I've always been dreaming to be a DJ. I even tried to gather equipment from the Radisson Hotel, hand me downs. Even though they are outdated, probably, I tried but they require much more tech support and money. So in some way, I wasn't ready at my age (which was 16). I still have it. Honestly, all I need is two turntables and preamp. Thats it. The rest I learn from scratch. Trial and Error, right? I won't forget to study the equipment and learn they do but I've done some study and know what each thing does. I'm not totally running into a wall. This is one of my dead set dream. To be a DJ. If I become famous, which I doubt, cool. Brownie points for me. But I just want to play tunes for people. Make my own as well. Hell, there are DJ's doing this because they have this enormous passion for music and want to share them with you. To enjoy this awesome gift of hardcore dancing. <br /><br />I've always been into doing sound mixing. Tweaking it, changing the equalizer. Mixing. Changing pitches. I've always liked music, though some of you probably know me as the guy who listen to a butt load of techno and dance music. I know you guys download it then say ""I listen to techno and dance too!"" No, I mean, do you actually download a shit load of music? Or listen to a online radio for 6 hours? Pure dance music coming from a different country? My passion. Its like how I am with gaming. Different topic I've discussed but this, Disc Jockey, is what I've always wanted to be. Always.<br /><br />And so, I am grateful to have people believe in me and say that I should continue this dream, although not loosing focus onto other things. I have people help me out and boost my ego, rather than having it made fun of and just throw it away. Then again, why should I listen to them, right? And so it begins. I've posted before, looking to see if I could shadow someone. I even posted back in the o3 days, asking for help on DJ equipment!. To learn more. A Dream becoming into reality. Something I've been looking towards for a long time. If you want to help me, then go ahead. I gladly accept it. I already got my Sony headset. A start, right? <br /><br />So I owe thanks for people who gave me some hints and ideas for it. I'm sure you guys know who you are. But for the one person who opened the light onto that dream, I thank you, <div class=""ljuser""><a style="""" href=""http://kaby215.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" alt=""[info]"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://kaby215.livejournal.com/""><b>kaby215</b></a></div>&nbsp;<br /><br />So with this, I leave you another dream, another chapter. Another reason why I still stand, hoping for some luck to come onto me and guide me to the path for this long life dream. If you guys wants to help me, by all means. I would appreciate it. Really :D"

"event","Now let me get this straight off, seriously.<br /><br />College, Education, Career. <br /><br /><br />Yes, those three matter to me the very most and I know I can get them. Now, what am I waiting for? I have no idea, really. <br /><br />Now, it puts me to shame. Like it adds up when people talk about it and make fun for me for it. ""Oh hes not going to school, failure"" ""Do you even care? Do you not want an education?""<br /><br />""Hes just stupid, because he doesn't go to school""<br />""Don't follow his footsteps, hes never been to school, only, what? 3 months of it? Ha, a joke""<br /><br />Hearing that shit over and over and sticking to me like ice on the road. Over and over. It hurts me, its as close as when I lost someone back then. I know I didn't go and do well in school, and I didn't try so hard to make you smile and proud of me. I'm sorry that I don't go to school and feel special and do the things i love to do. I want that. You have no idea how much of a low life class I feel right now and I always do.&nbsp; <br /><br />My intelligence isn't as great right now because its been so long since I've been in school. No, its the fact I'm not smart to anyone anymore. I'm just that kid who works at a gas station and bitches about trying to get money for school. First it started with the guys, this and that and I shrugged it off. But then it got worse and worse, and what did I decide to do? Not a care in the world. As some of you readers once said to me ""When its something that will doesn't want to hear, he will walk away from it. He only cares about something other than himself"" In the end, that really is it. I am seen like that to everyone. I created, shaped myself into something I thought it would protect in some way and not care as much as I did back then.<br /><br />No, I failed in myself. I failed to shape myself to the person I so wanted to be. To my ""friends"", to my family, to myself. At this point, you would say ""meh, hes bitching about it. He says this and that and want people to feel sorry for him."" Help? Of course I need help. But if you're gonna just sit there and make fun of me and ridicule me for being a lifeless bastard that I am, then go ahead. Only a few helped me in the past about school and we tried. Its not so damn easy but at the same time, I was slacking off. Either way, theres Grants and Scholarships that can help right? Of course. Could I qualify/? I doubt it, I didn't even try but I know I can't meet the requirements for them. Going to school equals getting enough money to go to it. Hence why I would like to go to a community college. Cheaper but you learn still. <br /><br />It makes me furious when my parents see my sister as the idol of the family. I hate it when kids get to go to school and their parents can pay off some of their schooling when some of us rely on pieces of paper saying if I am qualified for a government loan. <br /><br />No, I must not loose what I'm writing about. The reason I write this is because I finally realize what a <b><i>loser</i></b> I've become. My girlfriend goes to school and working hard. Yet she comes to me and I give her all the help she needs .A little push. Thats all it takes to help her out and she does it. Winner. But me, hell, months of swimming in nothing but something i tried to stay away from back then, I realized that I am seen as some loser or poser who hangs out with people who go to school.<br /><br />Yes I'm damn jealous you're going to school. Yes, I wish I had money or my parents had money to help me out. I wish I could be more motivated. I wonder if I should've joined the marines and got myself killed while going to school. Hey, I could at least say in heaven ""I was learning and going to school and fighting for some stupid cause because of bunch of old heads at the office said 'hey I don't like this and I dont like whats going on. lets send our young men to fight for us instead!'"" another story, I guess<br /><br />So in the end, what did I do when it all hit me? I stayed back and cried in some damn corner and tried to ignore it. What do I ask for? Well, I'm not sure when I try for help, I get answers but no push. Theres a difference between in getting advice and getting that push that will push you into that next level which you can finish it on your own. <br /><br />I want to say I want help, I want and need the help for this. But I fear that I will only receive either ""hey, its not easy! i didn't go ask for help and shit. I did it all on my own"" I know most things you need to work on but I'm not asking for a full attention. I'm not gonna drive you away from your&nbsp; ""needs"" and have you focus on me only. I just...I'm begging for help. I know I get lazy but deep inside I fucking scream for help. Who will listen?! Who will help me out and give me the push I need? Oh wait, you, readers, will just read this and say ""he has Kim to do that for him."" and it shrug it off. I FUCKING HATE YOU. You know that? yeah, I said because I did it before and I realized it such an asshole thing to do. But to think Kim will do that for me, she has things she has to worry about and I rather not have her worry about me so much. I'm not dead...yet. I' m still alive and kicking it , as long as I allow myself to keep dreaming. Its funny that I worried so much about getting someone to love me back then. I worried about making new friends, getting a job. Stupid. Idiot. I failed , really. Like I failed myself. I failed to get a diploma with the guys in graduation. I failed to go to college. I failed to getting a decent job. Oh wait, I guess you can call me a mexican now. Oh, no. You can't. They came here to work as hard to make a living and live the life they dreamed. So where does that place me? Hell, I don't know. Doesn't matter to any of you either way. Keep on dreaming, tell me that. Keep telling me that I'm such an loser, a nobody, a person who cant go to school, a person who doesn't have friends from college. ""Oh, hey. Its that one guy's friend who doesn't go to school. Heh, idiot."" I know theres many like me who can't be a doctor. Or a lawyer. I'm just some fucking idiot working at a Gas Station. Kim's mom, even said it. ""You guys will just work at some low class place, have a hard time living..."" Fucking bitch told me to file for some welfare. I'm an idiot and a nobody. And I will keep saying this to myself until some day, some miracle, something or someone pushes me out of submission. But for now, well, you're still reading this. You just want to know if anything is said about you. Sure, I will say it to you now. Thanks. Thanks for reading this and then going to look at something else and keep a little side note saying ""Hector is a idiot for bitching like a girl and not man enough to make his own path"" <br /><br />I'm not you. I'm Hector, the guy that believes that dreams can happen in dark times. the guy who sees everything differently than others. the guy who is a loser and wont admit much in life. the guy that one day, maybe, commit some act that will hurt everyone else, also himself. <br /><br />I don't want that. I'm really scared. I really am. <br /><br /><br /><br />P.S - if you're wondering if I have some mental issue , yes. Have shit tear you apart from age 8 till 20. I still live in those nightmares. <strike>and don't puppy me</strike>."

"event","Its much, much harder to ween myself off this addiction. Has been three months since I haven't played World of Warcraft, I got back to my feet and earning the cash and time I've lost. But hell, this addiction still clings. I guess the fact that I play and beat a game then work on another, tends to kill me when I don't have any games to play now. Now, with World Of Warcraft being an MMO and always has updated stuff to do, yes it makes me want to play. Now playing has its up's and down's. Very very very much. Like taking time out of you or just being plain addictive, I'm sure theres a lot more but I don't want to rant on. Trust me, I've been trying to keep myself busy and everything. To buying different games or work hard or hang out with friends but it still doesn't kill it. I suppose, to the fact that playing it for 3 years and everything, it sticks to yah! Now, heres what I've been signed up to do. Apparently, if I get back onto World of Warcraft, I will be subjected to rules. (fuck) Less playing time, or something, theres a bunch (Kim's hardcore regulations)(No, she doesn't control me unless its something....well you know). So where am I going with this? Well, the fact that I earn money and such and that I can play without bothering the parents for cash, I can start playing. But whats stopping me? Well, im afraid that what Kim's view on me when I play is that I become more of an asshole and jerk. I grow aggravated or something. Now, one I certainly know its a game and all and SHOULD NOT control me but I let it. My fault and such. So, I plan on playing, this time, less of ADDICTIVE PLAYER and more of as a common player. I don't know really, people say I'm better off without World of Warcraft and should be doing other things. What the fuck is there to do in Phoenixville? If you say hang out with your friends or go have sex with the town's water, screw you! I mostly want to play because of the updated content they have or just the friends I made on their. I would never be so socially open if it wasn't for WoW. Back then, I was afraid to speak on the freakin' mic or to open up to some stranger. To me, sure I haven't seen that person in real life or anything, but I became more socially open due to that game. Thats about it, I guess. Either way, I made mucho friends and played long enough to grow attach to it. I'm a hardcore gamer, I don't have the recent consoles or the best PC to play all games but hell, I read up on my games and lore. I'm sure theres many who don't agree with me there that I am one but I believe I am one. Its a new era, most people are bound to games either way. <br /><br />I mean, I rather have this damn addiction to games than to drugs or alcohol, right? ""Oh no, its still an addiction!!"" Sure, but its a damn hobby as well! Fuck, excuse me for not collecting coins or scabs. I rather do something I enjoy and tell people about it. I know I went off the subject with me playing WoW again, but I wanted to show some people out there why I play so much and have a fond for having it as a hobby. Although don't mix with someone who loves to play Guitar Hero and jam out DragonForce over and over <strike>and show off how my fingers can fuck 4 women in a matter of second</strike>s. Thats just wrong in all levels...anyways, I just would like to play World of Warcraft again. Just put some limits or just don't take it as hardcore as before even though I can't now because I make money...and money is what I need, really. We all do.<br /><br /><br />But, if you don't think I should play at all, you do have to realize this...Wrath of the Lich King is gonna come out soon...and I will bet you my ass will get back on. Or I should just go buy a used Wii remote and go to peoples houses and play Brawl...something like that. <br /><br /><br /><br />P.S - Kim, I hope you understand this and read this. Hopefully this gives you an understanding why. Also,<b> I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUUu......cake!</b>"

"event","Well today was another one of those days. semi-meloncholy and semi-overjoyed. I love my friends, I love my family. Its funny that it take a special occasion to realize this fact, funny yet sad. Im sorry my father could not see me today at all...but that doesnt matter, i love him....im sorry that my sisters could not see me today, but i love them....i dont know what is spurring this melancholy attitude on my part. i am thankful for everyone in my life...and those that i love know it...because i told them that specifically today. i dont know what else to write. so ill say goodnight to everyone....love you all."

"event","well the first semester of my last year of college has begun. i dunno what to think of it at this point. im a little excited, a little anxious, a little confused, and a little depressed about it. there are a number of great things to look forward to. after this semester is over i will have completed my minor (psychology) and have only 15 credits till i have my bachelors degree in the administration of justice, with a focus in government administration. this is a huge goal. i will be only the second person on my moms side of the family to have a college degree (my mom managed to get hers a couple of years ago). this is something that i am immensely proud of. however i am still feeling rather unfulfilled. there were a number of things that i had hoped to accomplish over the duration of my college years. a few of them didnt happen because of financial reasons, i still havnt been able to find a job that can afford me more than going out to an occasional dinner and going out on weekends. thus a good many of the trips i had hoped to take have fallen to the wayside. there are also a number of things that i cannot control that i had hoped would happen. i dunno why i fret over these things but they do bother me, and to tell the truth i do not feel the need to burden anyone with them but myself. i dont know why i am writing about it here. maybe its a subconscious plea for someone to do a bit of fishing in my head and bring it out of me. whatever. i dunno, i probably have a great number of problems that need to be addressed, but im not planning on doing so. i choose to just push them aside and not think about them until i am by myself, i like how that is working out so far. everyone see's me as the fun loving care free type of guy. which i am. however there is alot more to me than that. i think the same can be said for the vast majority of society. all i can say is that im sure however i end up, it will surprise a great deal of people. i think doing some seemingly uncharacteristic things will allow for people to truly know who i am, which is something i do not make readily available for the public to view. shit, i dont even think some of my closest friends know what makes me tick. who knows....im probably being over analytical of myself, but that makes me happy. i feel smart when i get these little epiphanies and of course i write them down as a reminder. being that i dont have pen and paper readily available to myself at the moment, i chose the internet blog journal to do so. so yet again i leave you with a goodnight. im off to be then up for classes tomorrow, along with doing a little research and getting some articles together for mym dad's work. it shall be fun....until next time

"event","I dunno what is goin on inside me but i think mentally i have gone through some changes in the past week. my discontent with where i am at in life has continued. not that i am unhappy with anyone or anything in particular. im just becoming impatient with how things are going. i wanna be done with school....i wanna be making money.....mostly im tired of working for people that are not as smart...er...educated as me. not to be insulting to anyone personally, but i have been able to do the job of all of my managers thus far in my life. i dunno i like to be challenged, and i havnt been challenged yet as far as work goes. alrighty, and yet again i am done bitching. im not sure if anyone reads this but im sure noone wants to hear me complain all the time. BUT oh well...it helps when i put stuff out there for everyone to know, it motivates me. anyway, school starts on monday, hopefully the change in routine inspires some more change in me. hopefully i meet some more new people, and hopefully i am able to pull good grades while taking 18 credits. i guess we shall see, later all, gnight."

"event","well, i am bored....already. im kinda anxious for classes to start again. if for no other reason that each day that passes is a step closer to being done, and i am ready to be done with school already. also i hate my job...so going back to class means i wont be working full time....which would be great. so i have had a random idea for this week. actually it isnt my idea at all. but i was watching celebrity fit club the other night and i was thinkin that if a bunch of whiney celebs can loose weight like they are, why not me? so i decided that this week i was going to shoot for loosing ten pounds. should i succeed i will be at 240lbs come sunday. this was the first day of it....i have a feeling ima be pretty grumpy and tired this week. so if i seem short with people its because i am keeping note of the calories i take in and i am working to burn at least half of them off at the gym. today i think i burned almost all of them off. between the stair climber, elliptical, and treadmill i burned 1200+ calories. so needless to say i am exhausted. but i am curious as to wether i can meet my goal. wish me luck. oh and by the way i am only talking about working out now because i dont have anything else to talk about....it was an uneventful day....well that it for now, next time i post i promise to have something cool to talk about. gnight"

"event","i am exhausted yet i cannot sleep. i dunno why. i feel pretty strange rite now. like my heart is racing. i do not know why. my mind keeps running in circles and i feel anxious. but i dont know why. i have no clue how to remedy this because i cannot pin point what is making me feel this way. i dunno, i keep calming myself down but as soon as i stop focusing on any particular task it starts over again. dont get me wrong this is not a bad thing, it doesnt worry me and it doesnt make me feel bad. its like that excited butterfly feeling you get when you know that you are on the verge of something important. i guess if that is the case there is a number of things that could be causing it. the main thing is that i have recently come to the conclusion that just getting by, in all, probably will not be enough to satisfy me. ive talked about this with a couple of people lately. but it applies to much more than the financial aspects of life. i need to start strengthening the relationships that are uplifting to me, y'all know who you are. i need to grow stronger spiritually, i guess that means trying to find out what it is exactly that makes me tick and figure out why i do things the way that i do. physically, well....i went over that in my last post, im a work in progress all i can do is keep plugging along. mentally i need to start challenging myself to be better, my mind is one of those untapped resources that i have, and if i am to truely be successful in life im gonna need to be sharp mentally. im feeling overwhelmed with the various options and paths that i can go down in any of these aspects of my life. so for now i think i am just gonna focus on just breathing, taking it all in, and apreciating all of the good things that i have going on for me right now. because that is all i can do rite now. its about 2am and i am awake. im going to try to go to sleep again. gnight all."

"event","well i really dont have to much to say at the current moment. i have been enjoying life, and thats about it. im working again, which in and of itself isnt to much fun, but i have money in my pocket...which is good no matter how you slice it. i am really really enjoying making new friends as of late, new friends that have spurred my interest in milwaukee ;-) anyhow aside from drinking frequently, talking about random subjects, sleeping in, working out hard at the gym (finally....damn back surgery will screw that up big time). the workouts have been paying off though. i am currently at 250, which is 25 pounds less than the 275 i balooned up to during the bed rest phase of back injury/recovery from surgery, and would like to loose another 25 pounds. eh...its wierd workin out differently than you ever have in the past. more cardio, less power lifting, blah blah blah. but anyhow i guess that is all there is to report at the current moment. oh yeah, it seems i have been given the opportunity to start writing some music again with my buddy chris up in maryland. ima jump on that, why not....it could be fun. anyhow that is it...seriously....im goin to bed....so i can get up, go to the gym, eat a lil bit, play madden while listenin to some sweet tunes, go to work, call lex to see when we are watchin the piano, ??????????????, go to sleep again, repeat morning process, get paid, work some more, and get wigged at kevs for his bday.....gnight....der"

"event","came close to touch, pushed away and left without a fuss. a slight complaint kept in the heart with no vocal sound...no visible change...while within changing everyday, continuous development into what one is. not what is expected, not what is seen in the mirror, not something that can be described. the truth of the matter is that no person is tangible...we continually change, once someone gets a grip on your being you can quickly turn a corner and become something completely opposite. how can anyone know that you arent acting? that you arent simply throwing up a smoke screen to mask the truth that is held within. why would anyone be willing to leave themselves completely vulnerable. is it simply because of the satisfaction of having the ability to put your heart in someone elses hands...should this be what one strives for...putting themselves out there when someone careless could easily break you. does the pain that can come really make you stronger? or does it simply kill a part of yourself... does that part simply go missing and the ability to feel that pain or that love go away for good? this is not necessarily what i believe, but a thought that i have in my head at the moment. personally i have never experienced a relationship that was fulfilling enough to warrant my giving my whole self to the other person. this is not saying that i have never wanted to, i do, but the opportunity is not there, it never has been. however there are people that i continually put myself out there for, and stand waiting for their beck and call. there is someone who will pick me up and take me along with them on their journey through life...and i cannot even pretend to know who this is and how it will happen. however i can hope.... and i know, at this exact point in time, what i would like to happen and who i would like it to happen with."

"event","Well not for me....i still have a year left (im in no rush). but yeah, this has been a peculiar past couple of weeks. i have seen and spoken to a good number of people that i havnt talked to for years....granted there was a reason behind some of that....but for the most part these were people who moved out of the area for school and are now back looking for job with some nifty pieces of paper in hand. It always strikes me as strange when i conversation is struck up with someone you havnt seen for a long time, and it actually isnt awkward at all. i love that feeling, like nothing has really changed cept for some new stories to tell. On another note i am overjoyed with the return of one person in particular. Its just nice to know that she is gonna be close and able to hang out more often. You know those people that no matter what you have going on can make you forget it all and smile....yeah thats her. It has become aparent to me that i would drop everything in a heartbeat to hang out with her. Is there a possibility that something more could come from this....i dunno, probably not...but one never knows, the world has a funny way of working. all in all im just glad that she is in my life and thankful for her friendship. anyway that is all i have for now, ima tryn keep up to date with entries....ive been slacking off."

"event","everything in my life seems to work itself in a circular motion. history repeats itself again and again sometimes with different faces...sometimes with the same. The fact of the matter is....at least with me....the harder i try the more dissapointed i will be when things do not happen, they rarely ever happen....period. ive gotten to a point where it has almost stopped hurting. i almost find it entertaining how i will continue to crash and burn. it happens the EXACT same way everytime. i am always the one to confide in....the one to make you laugh....the one that falls for you....and the one who is asked what he thinks of the new boyfriend. i dont know what it is that puts me in this situation, but im starting to have a feeling that it will never change. that this is the spiral course that my life will take. i dont want to change...i like who i am...so this will continue to happen. the end."

"event","Everyone has their weakness. There is a point that if pushed can break a person down into feeling like nothing. However if that adversity is to much for you to deal with personally there should be something to turn to. One of the commonplace understandings in life is their cannot be greatness without adversity. The feast seems so much greater if there has previously been famine....loneliness will make love twice as fulfilling....depression will allow for an appreciation of joy. It seems that society has taught us that everything should always be good, like everyone is entitled to a perfect life. Bullshit. Life is hard....there is no love without pain....without adversity in life nothing would be worthwhile, there could not possibly be anything to strive for. People should embrace the negatives in life and smile....knowing all the while that with each passing moment of pain they are getting stronger. There is nothing in this world worth killing yourself over. Fuck finding solace in the bottom of a pill bottle or redemption through the barrel of a gun. Know that in the world there is someone going through something twice as bad as you could ever fathom and appreciate all of the good things that you have.There is so much to be learned through accepting hurt and holding it close to your heart. Everyone is vulnerable, nothing is easy, tears will be shed, confidence will be shaken, blood will pour from a broken heart. Knowing that this is inevitable confront every day head on, don't bitch and moan about how tough it is....Living is a constant struggle made worthwhile by the fact that anytime and anyplace greatness could be achieved....a small gesture could bring joy....or the perfect love could be found."

"event","Music is one of the key to me making sense of life. There are few artists that can speak directly to emotions that are felt inside. A great number of people listen to music for leisure, I do this as well. However some days I'll lay on the floor of my room and listen to a song that can draw out any emotion that I am feeling inside. Music also helps make sense of everything that I am feeling. It is strange how art, in any form can do this. By listening to certain sounds, or looking at a picture I am able to release emotions that nothing else can get out of me. The beauty of song, poetry, and art can make my soul scream with joy or bring tears to my eyes. I started with music because the audible emotion that can be felt in someones voice is something that I envy greatly. That there are artists out there that can physically effect their audience is something special. I have recently been able to experience a show that brought a great many emotions that I have been feeling to a head. It was not the show in its entirety, but one song. I felt like I wanted to hold my breath for the whole thing so as to not interrupt the moment. I got goosebumps, I had to sit....and while sitting wide eyed observing this I was taken to another place. The fact that I can still relive that moment speaks to the power of music. Inside I know the feeling is real...however it is not my emotion I am feeling but that of the artist so perfectly being able to express what they are feeling at a particular moment in time. After the fact it leaves a void, and a desire to feel that emotion for myself. If it will ever happen...I don't know...but I will keep listening and hoping against hope that I will someday be able to fill that void."

"event","Well I'm back again. I have not had too much thats all that eventful go on for the past couple of days...besides papers, reading and things of that nature. I have come to a realization over the short time that has passed since my last journal entry. There are very few people that I allow myself to become close to. Honestly I really cant explain what makes me like this. It is probably because the people i care about take a general interest in me, and my well being. Or in some fashion need me to be there. These are the people that I would walk to the end of the world for. Their mere presence can bring a smile to my face. The strangest thing about this is that as I feel myself getting closer to them there is usually a wall, or occurrence of some sort that prevents a real closeness from happening. Its a perpetual problem that I come across. However I am willing to put forth effort to ensure that these friendships endure through these times, so that there may in the future be a time when we can look back on the trying moments and smile. At least that is what I hope for. For all I know I could be a presence to help someone through tough times and thats it. I think I can actually be content with that. Knowing that I can be there for someone brings me joy. Running the risk of sounding cliche I feel that one of my favorite movies describes this perfect. You are what you love....not what loves you. The fact that knowing and loving the important people in my life is all I need to get by, not necessarily them reciprocating it, allows for me to be content with who I am and where I am in life. So for anyone who puts their trust in me, and leaves themselves open for me to love them...Thank You...you are truly special and close to my heart. No matter how much time passes without words exchanged, know that you have impacted me in my life....and just thinking of you brings a smile to my face."

"event","my brain is quite possibly the most random thing that i have. it leads me down paths where i will laugh at the absurdity of everything that is going on....but could just as easily lead me to a more reflective place which can leave in in a more contemplative or even depressed mood. the most interesting thing is that with certain topics the pictures that i see in my head can be deciseively abstract. Im not really sure that i can describe it....but sometimes if i am thinking about you i will not see your face, your body, or anything that involves you. alot of times you could appear as a a color, a blur of motion, or even a certain scent or fragrance (the smell thing is not such a hard thing to imagine cuz scent is in all actuality the strongest sense tied to memory). however alot of time i cannot picture your face or tie these visions into anything....but rest assured it is decisively you and i know its you that im thinking about. i have no clue if this is a normal way of thinking about stuff but thats how i operate some of the time. the toughest part about this is that i often find myself struggling to find out what ties you to this color, feeling, or whatever i have managed to associate you to. eh. thats all ive got for rite this moment. lemmie know if any of this makes any sense. free writing is one of the things that i love to do the most. 

for my next entry it would be cool if someone provided me with a random word or words that i can just write on. i will attempt to not use the word in my entrie that way yall can tryn figure it out. talk to yall tommorow."

"event","Heh, I've been lazy about my posts because <lj user=""quikchange""> has been posting for me.  Mwahahahahhaha!!  Well, anyways, I'm taking his position and making a post.  

I woke up high from anti-histamines... I'm not even sure they did anything.  But it was quite fun.  Especially when I made all the phones go off and I started throwing them at <lj user=""quikchange"">, screaming FIX IT FIX IT!

Later, we met up with <lj user=""aciddawn""> in downtown Vancouver yesterday.  Shortly after, he got approached by a crack addicted at the Granville Burger King while <lj user=""quikchange""> was on the hunt for a public washroom.
CA: Do you have $2?
AD: No.
CA: Do you have $5?
Ad: No. I need to go to an ATM for that.
CA: Do you want a blow job?

Then when we told the story to my dad:
Dad: She wanted to pay you 5 dollars to give a blowjob?
AD: No, she wanted $5 to give me a blowjob.
Dad: Did she have teeth?
Because obviously, you don't want a crack addict with teeth to give a blow job (ouchy)

We got lost in the rain in Vancouver yesterday as I had no idea how to take the bus home.  Ah ha.  Ha . ha . ha . (siiigh)

What else what else....  well, I met my pathological liar friend who's getting married this week.  She ""forgot"" my invitation ""again"" just like how she decided ""not"" to go on her honeymoon to Mexico that she ""bought"".  She is also the one who ""quit"" from the local grocery store because it was ""not challenging enough"" but actually got fired for stealing.  However, she has a fiancee that looks Ewan McGregor.  Frick.  I have no idea how she does it.  

We went to the Flying Beaver Airport Bar and Grill for lunch.  The waitress who served us had boobs that almost compared to Pamela Anderson's.

I almost got into a drinking related accident at 1 o'clock in the afternoon.  This is a contract that I will never EVER drive again under the influence any cocktail drink. Especially especially Coke and Rum.  Ughhhh.  Yes, if I ever drive under rum again you must never EVER be my friend again in the real or virtual worlds.

<lj user=""quikchange""> wanted to see the seedy part of Vancouver so I brought him as far down Hastings Street as I dared.  Two blocks past Main St and then back through Chinatown.  <lj user=""Aciddawn""> didn't want to come with us to the <del>Gastown</del> PickPocketing Capital of Canada so we left him at the SeaBus station.  He never returned my text so we assumed something crazy and zany occured.  Fortunately, we didn't get pickpocketed and <lj user=""quikchange""> bought a dino for $4.  Unfortunately, we didn't get any blowjobs.  

After oogling the homeless, the drugged and the police watching them, we met <lj user=""krabbit""> at the Vancouver Public Library.  <lj user=""quikchange""> was in desperate need of Gatorade, which scared me because Gatorade scares me in general and the idea of <lj user=""quikchange""> hyper scares me even more.  But luckily he bought the clear kind and the promptly fell asleep up in the Special Collections floor in VPL.  I don't understand why not more people visit the 6th floor of VPL because it's practically a free museum.  I saw the majority of the photos we paid $8.95 to see at Georgia Gulf Cannery in the photobooks there as well as the attempt to destroy Chinatown, the Japanese Holding Station in Hastings before they were shipped out the Interior, the old downtown where all the homeless people live now, old Hotel Vancouver, the incompleted freeway plan through Vancouver (wooo for civil uproar), and the planning of the Expo grounds.  The Special Collections also have ridiculously cheap photos for sale.  They aren't the coolest of pictures, but they're still cheaper and nicer than anything else you'll find in Gastown.

After that, I continued my search for calf-high boots and fuzzy accessories.
I failed.

However, we went down to where the old seedy part of Vancouver used to be located, where now the Faggiest Rainbow Street in Western Canada is.  <lj user=""krabbit""> and I found the most awesome clothing store ever!!  And it is my little secret so you will just have to brave the fags and queers and find it.  I screeched at delight when I saw the clothes and I screeched even more when the prices were actually reasonable.  It was clothing heaven.

Then we went to Little Sisters Bookstore which has the most awesome assortment of books, dildos, butt plugs and rainbow bracelets.  (They mostly sell books.  I promise.  But the owner will give a full ""evaluation"" when you make a purchase)

Oh yes, <lj user=""quikchange""> got checked out more times than he checked out white ipod headphones in downtown.  I won't give offical statistics because I don't have eyes on the back of my head, but the ipods lost ridiculously badly.

<lj user=""quikchange""> just read my entry and now he wants me to do all of them.  But no no no. I just have humour right now, and it will be rotten and sour by tomorrow morning."

I suggest that if you graduated in 2003 and haven't received your Dogwood Diploma (which is approx. 100% minus the principal's daughter), call and be an ass.  I can't stand South Delta, especially after I got badmouthed for going to UW, ""kicked out"" in April for appreciating poetry, and general discrepancies with administration there (like the time principal ""didn't threaten me"" when I wanted switch out of a class because I was being ""political"" - bah).

"event","How much time do we really spend reading our bibles? Or actually, how much time do we think about Christ? I tried answering these questions in my head, and I realized.... wow, how could my life be that busy that I spend such a small amount of time with God, and such a LONG time being part of the world.

   How much time should we spend thinking about Christ? I think that we should spend our whole life thinking about Christ, maybe not in the same depth or anything, but through our actions. It's funny how a simple ""hi"" on msn can do to someone, or even a smile.

   Why is it we worry about what's not important? What is our plans for the weekend, what are we going to do, how am I gonna do this, what should I do? or EVEN relationships itself. If a person is thinking about something else, or SOMEONE ELSE for that matter, more than Christ, then there's someone wrong there. If someone loves someone else more than Christ, then there's something wrong there as well. 

   So strangely, why is it that at times, we reflect upon our needs? What about God's needs (well technically He doesn'T need anything, however, He gives us that opportunity)? Why are we bunched up on what worries US, when the bigger picture should relate to Christ?

   I think tomorrow, I'm just gonna lie on a structure at the park and stare at the sky all day, and examine my life. I wish I lived near Rideau, it's something about beautiful landscapes that I just admire, and a nice walk in a beautiful scenery is just what I need to think things through.

   Bahhhhh MSN. I dont think i'm gonna go on anymore, it's too stupid to play the standstill game where you wait for others to start a conversation. Digital conversation sucks =P. Well, looks like it's the end of MSN for me again. Peace!"

"event","Ok so the 30 hr famine was AWESOME. What happened? Ah that's my lil secret..... well actually I'm just too lazy to say every single little thing that happened. Sigh.... it'd take me like a million years O_O!

    Ah there's so much I have to do. I have to watch Full house obviously, and wow, is it in cruddy condition..... well not really, a lil wrinkles here and there on the cover =P. Yeah.... ms random, ur not getting it till like...... I get married lol.

    Romeo and Juliet is such a cool book. Go Shakespeare, I wish people talk that way. Pickup lines back then owned compared to today's society's. lol

    What else? I have piano, which I never practice for till the last minute, so basically I'm a terrible student. I disgrace myself T_T. I disgrace my asian blood too lol.

    Worship was good. I cant wait till next week. YAY BAPTISMS, I applaud Princess windy wendy fifi, Princess Ruby, Manshun, Hongyi, Sol, Jon and Jason. Yay!!!!!! I'm so excited! We should all go to bubblicity and reserve it all just for our churches lol.

    I CANT BELIEVE IT, I THOUGHT NEXT WEEK WAS OCAC's BAPTISMS! OMG i'm SOOOOOO SOWWIE GUYS T_T! it's all my fault T_T

    So basically this week, I'm going gift shopping, i haf kiwona's for band, I haf work, I haf so many things! I'M SUCH A BUSEH GUY! ahhhhhhhhh T_T I also owe caleb $10. Sigh.......

    I wonder how JJJJJESSSSSSSSE P and madi are doing. heheh ^^, I think they probably died from the 30 hr famine as well ^^, I shouldve visited their church before going to OCAC.

    I better start learning how to manage my time, because right now, I'm doing poorly."

"event","Wow, there's so much to say. Where should I start?

      I know =D, how about yesterday's COFFEEHOUSE? Woot! I applaud all the OCAC people for a job well done. Lesseeeeeee if i remember everything correctly. Actually lets start with friday!

      So er... friday, so many things happened. Someone lit a dumpster on fire, and it turns out it was a couple of my friends, ah tsk tsk phil x 2. So we practically lost the whole first period.

      Yf was SOOO fun, we had nice steamboat food. I ended up playing lots of foosball, and a lil STARCRAFT. YESHHHHH, BEST GAME EVER! lol, and then when YF was done, I joined H20 and we played PICTIONARY!~ OH BURN! BEAVEN HAVEN? LOL, soooo random.

      There was... um...Great MCs... go amanda and ruth ^^.... and then there was LOTS OF VEGGIETALES songs lol. There was worship with Mel, Ruth, and emileh. and then there was a depth talk and funny talk with.... um....... someone ^^ (bad with names). OHHH THERE WAS THE DANCE THING WITH EMILEH AND RUTH, lol, which was the best presentation ever ^^ (I got it recorded XD). er..... Worship..... and then er....... singing i think, I remember Sol was singing at one point, while Princess windy wendy fifi and I switched shoes. AW geez, such small shoes tsk tsk. Um....there was the ""rain"" which was a sad video. and then intermission where I got to meet sooo many new people XD. After that, my mind's a blank.

       OH WAIT..... i remember there was sharing T_T, it was sooo sad T_T. I cant remember when, but i remember Ian (YEAH, HARVARD ^^), and another person was sharing. there was more veggietales songs, and then also a ""dream"" presentation, and then finally like...... a DRIME =O! Go CANDICE lol ^^!

       Wow, to think I showed up with my loblaws uniform lol. Good thing i had spare clothes XD, and my trusty hairspray =O, which didn't help though -.-.

       It was SOOOO GREAT!!!! A SUCCESS! After the coffeehouse, I ended up calling onee-chan to seeeeeee where she was, only to find that she's SICK T_T. GET BETTER SOON ONEE-CHAN! oh there goes lots of money off of my parent's cellphone -.-, OH WELL XD. OH you better come to the 30 hr FAMINE!!!!!!!! >=(

       Stayed at OCAC for a while, talked alot and met lots of new people. Then my ride (after 20 min of talking lol) came and I was off. Wow, so many things happened, I loved it. pshh.... who cares about suyehhhhhh XD.

       SOoooooooo funny, I thought I saw kevin chow there, and then turns out it was HIM lol. Sorry i didn't say hi ^^.

       Oh that reminds me, Princess windy wendy fifi, somehow I ended up with ur hairband thing where you can make pony tails. O_O, i'll give it bak later i guess lol.

       GUESS WAH I DID TODAY? PHO!!!!! WOOT! Yummy PHO with my COOL FAMILY!

       Is it just me? or is this a pretty long entry ^^? Hm, i miss reading daily entries of my friend's lj. COMON guys, TYPE MORE!!!!!!!!! USE THOSE.... er.. fingers TO MASH ON THOSE KEYS AND MAKE MORE ENTRIES ^^."

"event","B-day? sigh.... lol

       So today I had a poetry test, which I forgot but somehow was able to ace it lol. 

       Ewwwwwwwwwwww, that's SO MANY NEEDLE SHOTS. Jess, that's just..... crazy O_O! At least ur not in any pain ^^.

       Science was just strange and dead quiet, while music was really loud and funish I guess. Haha, Blakely has to WORK TODAY! HAHAHAHA

       So wat was nice about today? Well I did get my birthday punches, which I got used to a while back, from the boys, and hugs from the girls. Fun fun..... 
   
       I feel so old........... <.<. Life progresses so fast, it seems like a quick flash. To the point where I've been born (by the way, I have no recollection of being a baby at one point, for some reason, my memories have always started from age 3 to whenever now is), to right now. 

       Today, I took a 3 hour nap, and as I opened the doors to my past memories, everything flashed right infront of me. In some cases, I'm sorta depressed because the friends that I used to be closed to is not here to celebrate with me. But at the same time, in other cases, I'm happy as well, because I've made many new friends.

       As I think of today, I wonder how ever-changing relationships can be. You can be close to one person, but suddenly after a year, that person may be the last person you ever think of. I wonder if sometimes the other person even notices how much it has changed. It'll always be a mystery i guess."

"event","Wow, I look at the time and I think, hmmmmm i should stay up till 12 just because it's gonna be my b-day ^^. WHeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

      Oh, I did forget yesterday about what Tracy and Carmen bought me. -.-, three stooges 2? haha, very funny -.-! Lol, I love it, it's great, i still can't believe you guys got me a gift though. Friendship is enough <.<, why wont anyone listen T_T?

      So coincidence or no coincidence? It just so happens that today, I met many familiar faces at the superstore. A flash from the past. As ""dark"" as my past may be, I did enjoy some laughs ^^. So i met Mrs. Taylor and Mme Ayote today. They came in to print out photos, and it was pretty cool talking to them again. It's been so long since I've been to trillium... Turns out Mrs. Taylor's daughter's best friend is one of the olympic medal winners for Canada. Pretty cool eh?

      So I ended up talking to my cousin on the phone.... when i was phoning another superstore lol. it was pretty cool, man, I havent spoken to Emmanuel (I'm sure he goes to OCAC at times) for soooooooo long. <.<

      Yuck, I'm drinking a freshly squeezed orange, apple and celery juice. Yummy yummy o.o.

      So like usual, I think I'm gonna start recording my thoughts by going into depth of one topic.

      For all you hardworkers out there (Hardworking as in not school studying, I'm a slacker and I actually get good marks somehow ^^), but you try and get the job done regardless of how impossible the task may be, I understand how you feel.

      I think (and later on, I'm probably gonna go more in depth with this) in life, everything meaningful to understand always starts with God. Patience, humility, trust, hardworking, loyal, and even if we go into topics like relationships, it starts always with God.

      But I find, we forget that alot. I find that people become impatient with life, they NEED something, they want it NOW, and they'll always take the fast track to get there. We forget our moral values, and we even forget how to truly love.

      I think I'll stop there, but probably in the later days, I'll explain... what I've seen in my life, and the experience that I've come to have.

      As for now, I leave you with this request. At the moment, I only have one person as a friend lol, so no, this is not pointing at you =P, or anyone else for that matter. But I hope that we'll all reflect our lives one day, and examine it thoroughly, the bad and the good, and not running away from our problems."

"event","Wow, interesting, I never thought I would show myself in livejournal again. It's been so long and I have three accounts now lol. It's surprising how one's opinion can change another.

    Well to start off, I'M BACK I guess. Thanks to a ""random"" person, also known as Ms. Random, which I doubt is a suitable name for her. Strangely, she keeps insisting -.-... So if you're looking forward to my livejournal, thank her if you know who she is lol.

    Well there's lots to say. Where do I start?

    LOL, I KNOW, ohhhh i know a famous person (Other than my wife-to-be Haruna, if onee-chan is reading this), my friend, and co-worker, is gonna be on Canadian Idol!!!!!! Turns out he passed the first three rounds in the beginning. YESH, go Jason Spence lol. I dont even know how good of a singer he is o.o. Anyways he's in the newspaper.

    Looks like i'm gonna be late for the coffeehouse, but i'll make sure to take LOTS OF PHOTOS lol, LOTSS!! 

    Stupid camera..... it's so unfair how the setting was set to 1 megapixel. Now all my pictures from the Getaway are ruined T_T. lol, but i'll probably mooch off of Grace or someone else who took pictures. Advice again from Ms. Random!!!! lol, getting popular arent we?

    Before I end, I'd just like to end my first entry by saying this:

    In this account of lj, there will be some info of stuff that happens in my life, like usual, but also, it will record my thoughts as well. Not so much as all my thoughts because I'm not that type of person. But I hope that none of anybody would be offended or even dependant on what is said in this lj. My belief as a Christian will intervine with part of my thoughts, because after all, I am a Christian lol. 

      My intentions aren't to point at people's mistakes, or even at people. My intentions are to record my thoughts and beliefs. As much as I would like to isolate myself and keep my thoughts to myself, I feel there's a part of me that can maybe point out a few things about life that others may have not noticed.

      So throughout my livejournal, please, viewer discretion is advised ^^."

"event","Hm. I love how im reverting to my old habit of staying up till like 4 am every night. Today was pretty good...

Can I just say how much I love Hollister (again?).

I've made alot of friends there..and I can't wait till I get my car back so I can go out and go to party's with some of them. I met this kid Nick today, he was really funny (and slow). Chill guy. Then I saw Kim again! I love that girl, she's really cute. Hmm and I love Jen...Elena...Lindsay...Kelly! Ah your all awesome.

Hm. Got really bored tonight...walked to CVS pharmacy (was closed at 10:30..who does that..honestly??) So I walked over to Publix and bought blue black hairdye. Wow what a mess. But my hair looks good.

FACETHEJURY is still addicting. I really want to meet someone I can actually click with. Hopefully it's not really some fat stalker that will kill me. 

Closing Comments:

-I think im getting sick
-Mad love to Karen...who is craving icecream and staying in on her only free day. :-X
-Sorry for breaking your computer Mich.
-I <3 Mollie x's infinity (keep ur hair coo')
-Mario...Friday is ours you ingenious bastard
-I like my new layout which I stole from michelle, who stole it from Joey
-I hate biggots
-I am hot

P.S----Tmrw= Last day at Rosarios! YES!!

"event","Wow...I hate waking up in the morning. Especially when I go to bed at 4 am! :-D

I thought I had work at Hollister from 11-4...which I did...but then this girl Jillian called and was sick...so I'm gonna cover her from 1-7. Which is better for me. More relaxation time! Woohoo...
Hm, I mean I'm in a pretty good mood...everything's goin good for me I GUESS. But I'm annoyed about alot of stuff. The first thing being...relationships. Everything about them. Again, I just don't know what I want. But I think I will when I see it (maybe?) so I'm not going to worry too much about it...Second annoyance is my breath....kill yourself (morning breath sucks). Third is that school starts monday. Also...I'm mad at a few people...one says that I'm ignoring them and going for ""other friends"". Why would I do that? Maybe I just havent had an opportunity to talk to you as much these last...3 days? Another person...I shouldnt even be getting angry over this, but I am. I mean...I may have led you to believe something else or something...but I don't understand why we can't talk and your being all annoyed with me. Whatever, I try. I sincerely, honestly, whole heartedly try. Mollie! Stop feeling down (Idk if you still are by the time your reading this...but if you are smile. Cos...I said so?)

Michelle...Mario...can we please have that 3-way ((I tried calling you last night Mario, but you didnt pick up. Shame. On You.))

Post Script-

Everyone go to FACETHEJURY.COM...and look for ""i_sex_myself"" ((muah)). Rate me honestly!

THAT SITE IS OBSESSIVE...DONT GET SUCKED IN!!

"event","Hm. Back from Hollister. God, I love that job! I really do love it...like I get to chill with the nicest people ever...and EVERY...SINGLE...PERSON...ranges from either CUTE to HOT. It's amazing. It's like you died and went to retail heaven.

Hmm. I'm bored! I love how I call or text people and they never respond! COOL! Uhm I'm really lonely...and I'm really confused. Like I've got the really nice pick of people....but I don't know. I dont KNOW what I want...I really dont. Part of me clings to the past...another half wants to go to the ""un-charted"" future...and then another part of me stays in a happy medium. It's so confusing, and I really don't know what to do.



Today was pretty fun though. I woke up and saw my grandmother...then went to the mall with my sister (OMG I SAW SUNLIGHT FOR A CHANGE YESS!!!) I saw Erica, Amanda, and Laura there. Had fun seeing them, and then got yelled at when I got home. I bought Silent Hill 4, and plan to play it tonite. 

I wish I could have went to Lindsays ""Harry Potter Marathon"" tonight...but oops...Im under house arrest.

Edit::

I have a terrible headache...and am in the worst mood ever. Things contributing to this? Who knows...maybe its my period. But then again, I'm a guy. So maybe not. I miss alot of things...maybe i'll list them...

I Miss:: 

-My mother yelling at me (wait no I dont!! I get that enough)
-Conversations with Mario
-Summer o4'
-The frivolty of Saint Davids
-The feeling of normalcy and meaning
-My friendship with Mollie
-Middle of sophomore year
-Talent
-Drive (did I ever have it?)
-Just holding and caressing someone that I truly cared about. Best feeling ever.

Woo hoo! Thanksgiving break! It's here! And I'm...GROUNDED!!! YESSSSS.
I had a Key Club/Kuanis meeting during school today, and got to miss 3 classes. I was with Carly, and we got to eat at this restaurant called ""the ark"" in davie (smells really weird...). Some eighty year old guy was like my new stalker. Kill yourself.

Im off to work at Hollister in like 5 minutes, so update time is very limited. GOD, I wish I could be Angel in rent. His voice goes so damn high though. (After an hour, Evita...in all her glory!!)

God Angel is awesome. I'm gonna dress up like Angel during christmas break (im not too sure If I wanna go full out drag tho...that takes some balls, lol) I might just dress as the ""normal"" Angel. Anyway, Emily is gonna take some pics of me as Angel, and then as Mark. ANd I'll post one up as my background. How exciting! Well...Jonathon Larson is my hero...and I have no life! Yay!

"event","What an exciting day!! ....


Well...got home from school...got yelled at...uhm looked at RENT pictures and downloaded RENT songs. I'm so excited about RENT!! God, no-one has any idea. I love Jonathon Larson like...he's helped me get through SO MUCH with his music...and he's such an inspiration. Everythign he's written...and all that he's written about. I know this sounds incredibly gay, but I don't care so I'll continue...Like within RENT I've found people I can relate to...'REAL' people...'REAL' situations...it's just amazing. I hope I can one to be ANGEL or something...and like do him justice you know? I could die a happy man.

My current new obsession? TICK, TICK, BOOM! 'Green, Green Dress' is an amazing song...and I think im doing it with Lindsay next year for Districts. I'll judge my ranking on that on whether or not to pursue MUSICAL theatre. Let's give a run-through of my day 2day, shall we?

Like I said...got home, got yelled at. Walked to Publix (an hour walk...but it was amazingly beautiful outside. I love this weather) and bought hair dye. The dye cost 20 dollars and all it did was turn my roots orangish, making me look like a giant fucking candy-corn. Then I spent a few more hours talking to Funk Master Mo (Mollie that is your new name) about how depressed I was. And then I looked at more RENT pictures. THEN...I decided I didn't want to hear my dad being upset anymore, and walked to get more hair  dye to cancel out the amazing 'candy corn' effect. And now i'm here...at 11:23 PM, updating my journal. After this...my hair SHOULD (hopefully) be a lovely chestnut brown.

But back to Larson. For those of you who don't know...he is the creator of RENT. An amazing guy...with amazing heart, drive, and message. And he unfortunately died in his early thirties due to a brain anuerism (I believe on the debut of RENT....how tragic?). So...John...this goes to fucking you. I hope I can one day either play one of your amazing characters...or write something that would please you.

Until then John...Until then.

here is a survey I just did...so I'm adding it.

Uhm, last entry was way too depressing so I deleted it. I'm now full on like a whole chocolate cream pie, and lots of Welches juice. Mmmmm. I'm really bored...Seventh Heaven is the WORST show in the world (well...second to only Full House) and Gilmore Girls is HILARIOUS! I had always criticized that show, but it truly does rock. The writing is wicked-good. I can't WAIT till Rent saturday night! It's so close...yet so far away? As Mollie said, I guess I can always see all them during intermission. Hopefully Joey will stop by too and won't be so lonely. Well, the house is freezing and I'm going to go take a nice, long, warm shower. Here is a quiz I took on Quizilla:

The room was noisy...the class bell was about to ring,

Suddenly, something clicked in my head.
It was a subtle clicking. Kind of like...well, a subtle clicking.
I slammed my head against my desk and realized it: ""I'm screwed!""
My gut kind of...clenched together, and I felt a little sick.
I realized I had spent 3 years fucking around in school...

So on that happy note! Today was just that... a ""day"". Nothing special...or endearing about it. I love how as SOON as I get into the car, my mother can scream at me for SOMETHING! Woo hoo! You ROCK MOM!! Anyways...highlight of the day was running into Ashley after school. She took me to McDonald's and back, and we had about 15 minutes of bonding. I miss her so much. Bahh!!! I just read chapter 2 of Great Gatsby...I think the narrator is gay? Cool.

"event","Laziness...it's a funny thing.
It's kind of like...like a drug.
You start to ""use"" it.
Now, don't worry...you're not dependant on it YET.
But slowly you'll see that other priorities slip away.
Grades...
Family...
Yes, even friends.
Now your hooked.
Now there's nothing that a good dose of Laziness can't fix.
It's fucking lethal.

"event","""Hi...I'm drained, and you are?""

I'm so out of it. The last two days...no like months have been insane. Between Calamityville...and Districts...and my awful collisions with my mother...and schoolwork. It's just crazy. I loved today though, even though I was completely gone by the end of the night (I'm still fading out...so forgive me if this entry makes no sense). I met alot of cool people today...Angie (the hottest girl ever!) I met her last night at Meaghans. Uhm...it was fun seeing the Western crowd today...as usual they did amazing and took Critic's Choice to be performed at Districts...Andrew and Brennan...do you ever cease to amaze? Anyways, also met this cool kid Joey ""You can find one at Wal-Mart...wait no! Target!"" (Say target in a french way...). Anyways...Everyone there was so amazing, I felt the need to just go up there and perform with them...but I couldnt. I want to make sure I do all that I can next year...and that I take home a shit load of awards and have everyone love me. I love all of my McCarthy drama friends...I really, really do. I love how I've been taking everyone for granted lately (not only them...other people. You all know who you are and im incredibly sorry). It wasn't that I had other ""friends"" to cater too...or that I was too busy being someone ""else""...it was just that I was getting lazy...so lazy that I didn't even want to take the effort to talk to people. I know that sounds awful...but it's the truth, and I whole heartidly apologize! 

-------- OKAY! Now that i've finished off with that ittle tangent... --------------------

There are a few things I want to bring up about districts that I really can't here...so if your really close to me just ask, and I shall tell! Nothing big I guess...but whatevers. Next year...this is my District...Award Winning...Line Up.

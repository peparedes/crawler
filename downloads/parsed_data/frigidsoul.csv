We have so much in common its not even funny. I can't wait to speak to her again"

Its called ""Aiding Terrorism"" I was just wondering if the US government would charge themselves with that everytime they buy large bulks of oil from Saudi Arabia. I once again reiterate that the only reason the drugs that are illegal are that way is because the government can't tax them. If they could they would be put right next to alcohol and tobacco in stores."

by Skid Row

Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
And when you needed me I came through

I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew you were there for me
Time after time you were there for me

Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you

We spend the summer with the top rolled down
Wished ever after would be like this
You said I love you babe, without a sound
I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss

Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you

We've had our share of hard times
But that's the price we paid
And through it all we kept the promise that we made
I swear you'll never be lonely

Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
Washed away a dream of you
But nothing else could ever take you away
'Cause you'll always be my dream come true
Oh my darling, I love you

Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you

Long distance issues and I think the way I feel towards her makes her feel uncomfortable. Its not like I'm like other guys who stare at her body and say ""HEY!"" and just wanna sleep with her, far from it...I really do care about her.

"event","It happened so long ago but till now I couldn't speak of it, couldn't even think of it without feeling upset somehow...but now I can

For those who didn't know its been a year and one month since me and my ex-fiance broke up. That's right folks, I was engaged.

We met in July of 1999 at the high school we had both been sent to, still to this day I can remember what she was wearing the first time I saw her...I can remember everything about that moment...where people were sitting in the caf, what music was playing on the stereo they let us use in the morning, even what fruit was being served with the school breakfast of cereals... apples and plums, heh

We didn't start getting close till September of that year, I found out she had a boyfriend that lived with her and her family(mother,brother,sister) but we were just friends at that point, nothing serious...I couldn't have been more wrong.

By December of 1999 we had gotten extremely close and I knew I had feelings for her, and when I finally told her ""I love you"" she broke down in tears and told me she was so confused because she cared for me just as much now too. Her boyfriend had been emotionally abusing her and cheating on her which evidently made her feel more for me than she did for him too. Feb 14th, 2000...Valentine's Day...I was no longer at school, I worked my ass off getting extra credits so I could graduate early...I had been done for a month and it was hard to see her as much. Up until this point she had been skipping school a few times to see me and I would go without sleep for a couple days so I could spend time with her during the day and still work at night. However I wanted to surprise her, I went up to the school and they let me pull her aside into a private room where I turned on the portable CD player I brought... it was playing Aerosmith's ""Don't Wanna Miss a Thing"", I sang it to her and proposed with a Golden Heart pendant that was covered in small diamonds...she broke down crying in my arms and said yes, things couldn't be more perfect...was again I was wrong

Months went by and I was working 60-70hrs a week trying to save up so we could get married and could have our own place. She had started working too by this time and we were losing track of eachother slowly but surely. I found out a week before her prom she was going with a ""friend"" from work, she said he had gone to the school and it was only as friends they were going... I didn't wanna think too much into it, didn't wanna suspect anything and ruin our relationship... I should have.

in September of 2000, a year after we started talking and almost a year that we had been together she stole $500 from me and left the city with the ""friend"". I learned that after her prom she had slept with him and by then she had been cheating on me for a month...which would mean only two months after we got engaged...I was crushed, I couldn't eat, or sleep...I was so sad I couldn't cry...the tears just were not there. It went on for about 3 weeks before my friend Tim was able to pull me out of it, he's like a brother to me...

Anyways now you know, and perhaps that will shed some light into part of the way I view myself today..."

after somebody whom shall remain nameless said I cared for the world I decided to look deep in and find that this is wrong. There are 3 girl/women who I would date

Diana: She's perfect, she always makes me laugh and she's beautiful too. I seriously have feelings for her and feel guilty for having them because she's young. But I counter that with the fact that by the time we meet she'll probably be 17 and it won't matter

Shondra: An absolute angel, she puts a smile on my face at time when it seems impossible. I can't wait to meet her

Khrissy: My support, nobody seems to care as much about my well being as she does. I'm grateful for just knowing her

there, I care for nobody else or should I say am interested in nobody else. There was one other before those 3 that I was dating but she makes me feel bad about myself, made me feel like everything was my fault so oh well

I often wonder though if I'm good enough for anybody, I despise myself more than anybody else could for past events...and whilst I found out from somebody recently that god forgives all I can not forgive myself. I don't feel as though I deserve to be happy after what I've done... perhaps it will one day change

"event","Bullshit, absolute and utter bullshit. I refuse to say names this time but the ones I am complaining about are Canadian. Perhaps they don't care as much because they aren't as close to it, or perhaps they just refuse to open their god damn eyes and face facts. You keep criticizing the U.S. and saying ""Stop the killing"", when we haven't even retalliated yet. Then you say our leaders are evil...I guess you have to be real evil to help other countries in their times of need. Hold your peace rallies all you want and stay blind to the situation...and when they start crashing 757's into your little rally perhaps then you'll wake up.

Imagine we blah,blah,blah...that's just the problem though...you're imagining whilst we live in reality and watch true heros spend countless days going through the rubble...stupid little fucking immature punk kids

by the time you stop imagining and join reality it'll be too late to realize that we are not the ones at fault

P.S. I find Tony Blair to be a very, very good leader"

"event","Well my left arm is immobolized in a sling. God knows what I did to it, but I can't extend it very well and its extremely stiff. I went to the hospital and they said it could be a few things, but if it doesn't get better then I might need arthriscopic surgery...oh well...typing with one hand aint too fun lol"

"event","Last night as I came home from work I saw numerous people driving drunk with somebody hanging out the passenger side window holding American flags and honking...its one thing to be patriotic but people are going to wind up getting hurt.

Then at about 1am eastern our power flicked off and on and then numerous sirens...I'm hoping a transformer just blew and none of those driving drunk crashed into a pole and knocked down a power line

Looking at them last night made me realize what a stupid drunk I must have been, oh well..least its in the past"

"event","First before I say anything let me once again reiterate my appologies to everybody I've hurt...we need to all join together at this time

Tuesday, 45minutes away from where I live and work everyday, 2 planes departed. These two planes carried innocent people going about their daily routines. But they also carried messangers of death which took these planes and in an act of cowardness they drove them into the financial district of America. When they did this they declared war on not only us but the free world and civilization itself.

First off I'd like to thank all the nations that have come together during this period of time and I too will be trying to enlist in the military even though I shouldn't because of my medication issues. I however wish to enlist not for revenge or to avenge anybody but in order to take part in stopping terrorism. I don't want anyother country to have to go through what we have and I want to see those who did this, those who support these people, and those who harbor these people eradicated...because they are not innocent at all.

I would also like to see the gangs of America unite. Stop the pety turf wars, as Americans all of America is your ""turf"" and mine...defend it...for the real threat is terrorism...not somebody who lives a block down the street and claims their street is better. We must unite

I'm somewhat sickened by somebody whom I know. Though he's not an American the fact that he has previously stood up for Bin Laden in our conversations and the fact that he doesn't want to see us retaliate and kill these terrorists because they are human beings appals me. So to Sean and everybody that thinks like him are these people truly human? Can you truly be a humane member of society and kill thousands of people for no reason at all? God save you

and God Bless America"

"event","I came to the conclusion that perhaps since for the most part I've left the net I should put up the comment section again since nobody can really get ahold of me to reply so that's that, now on to weirder things

Last night I dreamt I was at Diana's house (even though I've never seen it, it wasn't my house...Diana was there, and we were in what my subconsious labeled as her room) I fell asleep on her floor with nothing but a torn pair of jeans on so she took them off of me, put sweat pants on, and a couple of blankets because I was shivering...I don't remember anymore of it lol

so in closing I know she's grounded for something(checked her LJ) but maybe I'll give her a call sometime. She's a gorgeous young lady, sweet, smart and she has one of the most soothing voices ever ^_^ I really miss her...probably miss her the most because before I recently took my leave we had started to get close and develop a great friendship...oh well, I'm not gonna go getting sappy but that's all...perhaps I'll update again in a couple days or weeks..who knows"

"event","Well yesterday I learned that sadly our Sou Chef is leaving and taking on another job for $15,000 more a year...so he'll be making a good $45k a year. On a bright note Durand will have given his two weeks notice by today...so where does this leave me? Well seeing as how Dave(Sou Chef) will no longer be there they are going to make Michael the new Sou Chef(he deserves the title, does a kick ass job) and seeing as how that waste of life Durand will no longer be there for the next two weeks all eyes are going to be on me...if I can handle it they are going to make me lead line thus giving corporate a good enough reason to boost my pay by quite a bit more...so after all this is said and done I'll be making in the neighborhood of $15k-$18k a year...not bad at all for a 19 year old. From there who knows, but I'm wicked psyched and I know I can handle it because I've run a kitchen before. Well that's all and on the off chance that Dave should ever read this (1 in a billion shot) good luck, we'll all miss ya"

In my face It's not over
In your room I'm not older
In your eyes I'm not worth it
Gimme back my alcohol
Give me all your...
Give me your
Love
Fuck"

"event","I know, I know the sun is hot
Mosquitos come suck your blood
Leave you there all alone
Just skin and bone
When you walk among the trees
Listening to the leaves
The further I go the less I know
The less I know

Where will you run?
Where will you hide?
Lullabies
To paralyze

Fat and soft, pink and weak
Foot and thigh, tongue and cheek
You know I'm told they swallow you whole
Skin and bone
Cutting boards and hanging hooks
Bloody knives, cooking books
Promising you won't feel a thing
At all

Swallow and chew
Eat you alive
All of us food that hasn't died
And the light says

Somehow they pick and pluck
Tenderize bone to dust
The sweetest grease, finest meat
You'll ever taste
(Taste, taste)
So you scream, whine, and yell
Supple sounds of dinner bells
We all will feed the worms and trees
So don't be shy

Swallow and chew
Eat you alive
All of us food that hasn't died"

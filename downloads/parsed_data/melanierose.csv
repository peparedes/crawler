"event","<lj-cut text=""More ranting, with spoilers"">So, after watching the last episode, I&nbsp;have to say that I'm thoroughly depressed. I&nbsp;mean, assuming the show gets picked up, what the hell are they gonna do?<br /><br />I mean, the worst thing for me was killing Ianto. Hands down. But Jack's actions... I mean, could they have tried any harder to make Jack really, really unsympathetic? I mean... I&nbsp;get the antihero thing, and even can get behind the whole sacrifice-one-to-save-many thing. But making him sacrifice his own grandson? As his daughter watches? While the world (and particularly the government) tear itself apart? How can they come back from that?<br /><br />At this point I don't really want the show to continue. I can't even believe I'm saying that after being so tense about the possibility of it being canceled. But after watching Children of Earth, I just don't know how they can go on. Maybe it was never meant to continue, I&nbsp;don't know. Apparently RTD wants to, as well as the cast (all two of them, plus Rhys and Andy). But at this point, after the harrowing experience that has been the past week, I&nbsp;don't really want to watch it. I love dark stuff, but this is too much. I was just miserable for the last two hours of the show, got no enjoyment out of it whatsoever. Why would I&nbsp;want to go back to it?<br /><br />I'm just hoping I can deal with seeing John Barrowman outside of the show again someday. I adore him as a person, and always loved Captain Jack (until&nbsp;now). But... well, I need time. Torchwood, Doctor Who and Captain Jack, I think we need some time apart. I&nbsp;need to take stock and see if this is really the relationship I want with you. I think it's time to go on a break.<br /><br />Ugh. Never been so bummed out by something like this before. Worst part is that I'm feeling very unmotivated to continue vidding about the Whoniverse after this. Even Doctor Who feels gross right now. And to think, I was looking forward to this series so damn much. And it's damn near killed any interest I have in anything Who related. Thanks, Torchwood, RTD and whomever else is responsible. Yuck.<br /><br />Off to find another fandom for the time being.</lj-cut><br />"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Torchwood Rant (spoilers for Children of Earth through Day Four)"">Ok, I know it's just a TV show.<br /><br />That said, I don't think I've ever been so devastated by a media source. LotR made me cry quite a bit, but tonight I spent a solid ten minutes fully open-throated sobbing. With several&nbsp; hours of interspersed quiet crying. Seriously, I cannot even believe they killed Ianto. I am completely heartbroken, horrified and appalled.<br /><br />It takes a lot for me to give up on something I love in regards to TV, movies, books, etc. But for reals, I'm done with Torchwood. I'm not even sure I want to watch Doctor Who anymore. It's all just so tainted for me now. All I can do at this point is pray to the gods of dues ex machina that they're going to bring him back somehow. But man... I don't know. They've been basically setting us up for his death for a while now, what with the radio play and all the sweetness between Jack and Ianto in the first three episodes. And the death speech... good grief, I'm starting to cry again. This is just sick.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll feel less strongly about it in time. Right now I feel like I went through an actual death. Perhaps it says something serious about me that I can take the death of a fictional character so fucking hard. But the fact is that this character, and the relationship he plays a part in portraying, have brought me a lot of joy in the past year or so that I've been watching it. And now it's all over. I'll never be able to enjoy the show again. I mean, it's sci-fi, so they may even bring him back somehow. But you know, even if they do... I&nbsp;don't know. I don't know if I can trust the show anymore. I'll always be waiting for it to happen for real, or whatever.<br /><br />What's possibly the worst thing: even as I'm going through this grieving process, I'm feeling completely pathetic for getting this worked up over a TV show. Like, thanks Torchwood, for not only stripping away the pleasure you've given me so far, but for making me feel like the biggest loser in the world for loving it that much.<br /><br />I'll be watching Day Five tomorrow or Saturday (whenever I get hold of the show online), but honestly I don't even want to watch. I'll spend the entire time desperately hoping they take it all back, and knowing they won't. Fuck you, Torchwood. If you're back for a fourth series without Ianto, it'll be without me as well.</lj-cut><br /><br />"

So I arrived promptly at 3:30 for the ASL&nbsp;Interpreter panel, which turned out to be the presenter (another interpreter), myself, one other interpreter who had also interpreted last year, a requested science guy to help explain terms, and a random passerby who kept interjecting unnecessary elaborations on the aforementioned science guy's explanations. Like, srsly, we're here to learn the meaning behind some of the science terms that might come up so that we can apply conceptually accurate signs during interpreting, not debate the differences between Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principal and Wave Theory, GOD.

First thing to interpret was the Mark Time Radio Show, a mostly audio-style presentation in the tradition of Prairie Home Companion. Quite amusing, but a bit of a challenge to interpret something that depended so much on the ability to make out difference voices and accents (not to mention sound effects). It was the first time I'd interpreted ANYTHING for about a month, so was feeling very rusty and idiotic throughout. Fortunately if there's one thing I do well with interpreting, it's characterization, which is helpful in portraying voice actors.

Sat during opening ceremonies, during which they announced the Guests of Honor. Among them are some of the original MST3K team, including Joel Hodgsen, Trace Beaulieu (Dr. Forrester &amp;&nbsp;Crow), Frank Conniff&nbsp;(TV's Frank) and Mary Jo Pehl (Pearl Forrester). Got all excited for a second thinking they were going to stand up and wave (SEE THEM IN PERSON SQUEE), then deflated after finding out they won't be there until tomorrow. Ah well. There's still an infinitesmal chance I&nbsp;might be able to interpret for them. But probably not. Especially since there's no way I&nbsp;wouldn't slime them.

Then, off to the panels. The first was Neil Gaiman, about which I&nbsp;pretty much know of Sandman. That's it. So a lot of guessing about context of signs, but felt MUCH more comfortable than during the Radio Show. The con's one and only deaf participant (there are four interpreters roaming the con for him alone, bless him for giving us a reason to be there) decided to skip the Torchwood panel and go to bed. DAMMIT that's the panel I wanted to interpret most. Srsly. So, took it upon myself to go interpret the damn panel anyway, deaf participant or no. And what I realized as I&nbsp;listened to (and signed) panelists struggling to remember things like episode names FER CHRISSAKE is that I could totally be on one of these panels. Or, at least, that one. I kept having to control myself when I wanted to correct or interject. Still, had fun and then went home. OH&nbsp;although I&nbsp;did manage to sneak in a few Tweets along the way: http://twitter.com/geekchick1013

I'll be skipping tomorrow due to having to work my &quot;real&quot; job, but after being convinced that interpreted Vilification Tennis is a must-see, I may have to trek over there tomorrow night to take that in as an observer. Fun fun!"

As is fairly typical for me, I've got the TV on while I sit here playing with my laptop... they're showing Lexx on the Sci-Fi channel. You know, I really love the Sci-Fi channel. Even if it's not showing something super-interesting, it's great to have on as background noise. Plus you can catch some fantastic random stuff. Everything from old obscure sci-fi shows from the 50's to the widescreen director's cut of Stargate. It rocks.

Oh, played LaserTag tonight. It was fun :) I did pretty well for a girl. ;)

Okay, all done downloading. Off to play with the DVDs.

When the only thing you cried over was your mom being late to pick you up.

When stress was addition and subtraction.

When friendships were as complicated as who's house to sleep over and who's to TP

When shaving cream was just meant for play.

When a first kiss only lead to cooties.

When valentines day meant cards for all.

When birthdays were a class event.

When a friend moving away was the saddest day of your life.

"event","The Angel's wings have been broken. She was cast down from the heavens for exposing the truth.

  Angel befriended one in pain, the angel Pariel. 

   The love blossomed between the Angel and God. God loved the Angel so, but she would not bow down to him. No enticements, no gifts, not anything could change her position. God loved her but grew tired of her refusal. Both God and the Angel being ""Pure of Heart"" could not say the truth to one another. Pariel was there for the Angel in the time of pain and frustration. Pariel encouraged the Angel to ""save"" herself from further harm from the holy relationship and upon the advice of her close friend; Angel made the decision and broke off the personal engagement between her and God. 

  God wanted what the Angel could not give. Pariel could give what could not be given. The Angel was a liability for the angel Pariel, so in fear Pariel convinced God into expelling the wronged angel from Heaven.  And so the by the word of God, the Angel was cast from Heaven. 

  She fell to a barren earth. No life existed, no one existed. She was alone. The Angel sat there, time was of no value. She had been sitting in her void; she did not take notice of the change around her. To her, the earth was just as barren as when she fell. But in reality life has begun and has continued growing.   The Angel laid in despair; the shadows of pain, guilt, anger haunted her. She needed someone, but no one came for her. 

  The Liar, now Fallen, Pariel.

 It wasn't until a small, older woman with a weathered face and wrinkles of wisdom approached the Angel.

  ""What is the matter young Angel?""

  ""I am an Angel but not of young, why do you bother me with this pitiful question?""

  ""As a woman in my age I would say you are in pain over a broken heart, not once, but twice.""

  ""I am. But what could an old woman do for an Angel who has been cast down from the Heavens?""

  ""I can show you beyond the bounds of love, beyond the constricts time, I can show you Life. That is if you are ready to let go.""

  ""I cannot let go of the wroth of what has been upon me. The wrongs of the past cannot be changed, even as an Angel, I cannot fix time.""

  ""Those who regret shall never escape the shadows of the past. No person or Angel can.  But, you can embrace it and enrich the life and beauty of it which it holds. All that is needed is the will to move on. This journey for you has been difficult but you are now not alone. Those who hath brought wroth down upon you will be paid back in retribution through fate. Need not worry, you will find solace someday within your heart. You need not another to make you whole. You were created whole, and that is the absolute truth.""

  ""Who are you?""

  ""I am the who in which the name the Traveler. I have forgotten my name long ago, it matters not who I am but what I can do. Names, Labels, Genus, Species, we are all unnamed until it is given from someone who believes they are of higher power; when in reality they are but all the same as the one who they name. If you feel you are ready to move on, shed your broken wings of past and traverse with me, with new wings of the future. """

"event","I chose Walt Whitman for my biography report because Mr. Farlow said that if I wasn't going to take this class seriously and pick a real poet I might as well not come to class anymore. Walt Whitman was an awful child molester who was born in ancient Hong Kong. He is over 3000 years old and remembers the names of all the forgotten Gods.

Walt Whitman is 90 stories tall, and his adventures are legendary. With his blue ox, Emily Dickenson, Walt Whitman traveled across young America and helped the nation grow into the angry powerhouse it is today. He dropped his mighty axe, forming the Grand Canyon; the apple cores he would spit from his mighty mouth planted apple trees all across the country, and the stop of his mighty boot caused the stock market to crash. He and his friend, Huck Finn, traveled down the Mississippi river and freed the slaves. Walt Whitman believed that the only good china man was a dead china man so he went to Tiananmen Square and gave them all candy. Except instead of candy he killed them.

Walt Whitman's might seem like a real cool guy but in reality he's a whiny ass pussy. His live journal, which he doesn't think anyone knows about, is full of whiny Goth poetry. His current mood is always ""apathetic"" and his music is always some obscure punk band that no one has ever heard of. Some people who pretended to be his friend so they could get access to his ""friend's only"" posts grabbed some of the poetry and made a book from them, and called it ""ode to Faggotry"". When they found out other Goth kids actually read it, they changed the name to ""leaves of Grass"" and it sold like Goth cakes. Walt Whitman to this day doesn't know they're selling his poems and making a fortune off him. They still don't invite him to any parties though, because no one likes him.

Walt Whitman died a lonely man in Walt Disney land. He was on the gondola ride, and he fell out because he wasn't fastened properly to the restraint. Thanks to his dumbass, now none of us can ride it anymore. Thanks a lot Walt Whitman."

"event","im in a run down appartment somewhere in the middle east, it kinda looks like patsya house, my aunt saundra, my mom, claire, and a guy in a bright orange coat are there, i forgot what we were talking about, but everything was normal, so i decided to take a shower... there is a tv screen in the shower and on it you can see yourself from your shoulders up in the shower, so i started singing bohemian rhapsody and dancing, it was very exciting, then strobe lights went on and dry ice started to come out of the drain, this went on for quite some time... then i was rudly interupted by melissa who wanted to take a shower as well, there were no towels so i hid behind a wicker basket, melissa kept trying to barge through the door(which was really just a piece of red cloth), but i had a super long arm and kept stopping her, then sparkels fell from the ceiling and i was dressed! I went back to the living room where everyone elce was and they were all freaking out because my mom saw a suspicious looking man across the street, i wanted to see, so i started to walk up to the window, aunt saundra tackled me before i could,and the man in orange said ""he has a gun"" dun dun DUUUUUU! claire hid under the orange coat with the man. we hear Sirens from the distance.. its the police, the suspicious gun man takes off running down a long dirt feild on the side of the house, then the police get here and start questioning everybody, but i think thats borring, so i slip out the side door and get caught in a cross fire between the police and the fugitives but im unfazed and just keep walking, there are trees on the other side of the dirt feild. i want to get there, but i am stopped by a wall of bullets, more and more bad guys appear each seccond that passes, i still just want the trees, the bullet wall spreads out, so i start to manouver my way through it, all the bullets are hitting the ground around me, dirt is flying in my face, i get shot in the leg and fall down, then mountains of dirt appear, the police and fugitives take off running down the long feild, im all alone traped under a dirt mountain with a bullet in my leg... lili shows up and pulls me out, she askes me if i want to go shoppin at the local market at the other end of the dirt feild, i tell her i got shot, and then we go to the market.. we shop for a while while a war breaks out,and then i wake up at 6, then i fall back asleep, and im with lili and some of her friends at one of their houses, we are all drunk and are watching a movie about a guy that murders people with a chainsaw, i think its called Jason, but i have never seen it(in reality)... anyways in my version he chops them all up into little bits and eithor microwaves them and eats them, or makes art out of the little pieces and has his own gallerie... then i think i see him point at me, but im drunk so i just get scared and pass out. When i wake up i think im still asleep, because im with my family outside a nice big house that resembles mine, there is confettie falling from the sky and reporters and photographers are everywhere, i look up and there is a big banner that reads ""Reality TV blaofjjhgem kkhn"" i cant read it all, because the sun is shining on it.. then we are instructed to go inside, i still have no clue whats going on, then i look at my dad and he smiles so i feel ok, once we get inside they lock the door, we go to the living room, everything is red, we sit down on the coutch and wait for an instructional video to come on... once the tv turns on we see a huge helicopter lower barbed wire around the entire house that we are inside, everyone cheers, a man comes on the screen he smiles and says ""now there is no escape"" in a voice that kind of kreeps me out... then they pan on the croud, HOLY FUCKING SHIT!! how come i didnt notice this earlier, they all have Jason t-shirts on and and are chanting his name waving their well-crafted cardboard chainsaw cutouts above their heads, all of a sudden the power goes off, and i hear what sounds like a chainsaw starting up, then running.. melissa screams and runs out of the living room, then she screams once more, this time as loud as she can, that is the last we ever hear of her... the sound of someone you love getting their head sawed off, not very pleasant... the power comes back on just long enough for the anouncer-guy to tell us to run out the left door, and the door moose ran through is sealed by a big steel door that came from above, so we run,(if i explained everything that happened in this house this journal entrie would be 3 times as long, so near the end of all the scareness.>) lili and i get separated from our dad in the darkness, we crawl up a big staircase to the attic, she decides to hide in one of the hope chests, i dont want to leave her there, but i dont want to stay, so i leave and find a tiny crawl space that leads me to a giant room filled with baloons, i look down and see giant metal spiders crawling up the walls and popping the baloons, but they have cameras attached to them, so i quickly scoot back in my crawl space, then Liza shows up, ""liza what are you doing here!?"" i say, she wanted me to apologize for last night, now im confused CHINO 

the rest is filled with death, destruction, dissapointment, pointlesness, sex, and hot guys, so no need to go on...

now i must take a real shower!"

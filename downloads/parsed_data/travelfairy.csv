"event","Another spectacular hockey game, not that dramatic like yesterday's game but exciting enough. The Netherlands beat Australia(I love Aussies but we must beat them) 5-3. 2 games played, 2 wins, 6 points. 
And Ajax (soccer) won the first league game of the season away against Vitesse 1-2. Great start."

"event","about the way some people are treating my sister. You (and you know very well who you are) act like she's some kind of monster you have to destroy, that you can hurt for no cause at all. Well, I know Chantal way better than you all together and I can tell you she's not like you picture her. She has her flaws (like everyone in the world) but she's a decent, caring, loving, generous person and I happen to love her very much. She's not some kind of stupid moron you like to believe. She's a very intelligent person that knows very well what goes on in the world. She can be very depressed but she has good reasons for that. And she has feelings so please quit stepping on her heart all the time. If you don't like her, that's fine but then leave her alone. You could at least respect her. Now you are making a fool of yourself acting like you do. If you don't like me telling you this, that's fine with me as well. You don't need to be my friend. I just want you to quit bothering Chantal. That's all."

Did I shave my legs for this?

I love this Deana Carter song but the title makes me giggle already. Do you have any specials?

"event","Inspired by the ""Top 2000"", an annual 6 days radio show, playing 2000 all time musical favorites.

Let's make a ""LiveJournal International Musical Favorites Top""

The rules:

-state 10 of your all time musical favorites
-rate them from 10 (number 1) to 1 (number 10)
-the songs have to be know all over the world
-only one songs per artist
-send your list to me before Jan. 31

Tell your friends. If they can't post, let them send an email

Due to the rules my hero Boudewijn de Groot won't be on my list. He's a legend over here but outside the Dutch language area nobody knows him and I had to ""throw away"" a few faves because some artists have just a lot of great songs and I love many more songs that I had to leave out. Here's my ""censored"", ""official"" list:

 1-10 John Lennon-Imagine
 2-9  Billy Joel-Piano Man
 3-8  Queen-Bohemian Rhapsody
 4-7  Bryan-Adams Please Forgive Me
 5-6  Bonnie-Tyler Total Eclipse Of The Heart
 6-5  Simon&Garfunkel-Sound Of Silence
 7-4  Tina Turner-River Deep, Mountain High
 8-3  Simple Minds-Belfast Child
 9-2  Rod Stewart-Sailing
10-1  Otis Redding-Sitting On The Dock Of The Bay 

That's about the idea. Let's play!!!"

"event","It's Sunday nearly 8.30pm and my holiday is ending. In less than 12 hours I'll be at work again and it will be awfully busy because we are closing down the financial year. I've had 2 weeks off but it seems so much shorter and I could use some more time for myself but duty calls. I know you can't be lazy all the time but I wouldn't mind to have a sabbattical. Too bad I've to earn money for my living. I really don't mind working but it's wonderful if the alarmclock doesn't ake you away from your sweet dreams and you can just do whatever you like without serious duties. I would have enjoyed some more time for myself. I've had so much stress the last couple of months, in both private and business life and there's a lot of business stress lying ahead the next couple of weeks. The private stress will hopefully gone after Wednesday. Theo will get another bloodtest and a CT scan and then we'll know if the cancer is beaten. Today I've watched the European Championships allround  speedskating most of the Dutch did very well (several dstance medals including golds, overall with the men gold (Gianni Romme), silver (Rintje Ritsma) and bronze Mark Tuitert) and with the ladies bronze (Renate Groenewold) after 2 Germans (Anni Friesinger and Claudia PEchstein), even when ""my"" Jochem wasn't competing. That's life. Well, I'll watch a bit tv and then go to bed. The alarmclock will go off at 6.45am. I hope I can sleep. I've gone to bed late (or early, depends on how you look at it) during this holiday so I'll have to get used to going to bed in time again and I often suffer from insomnia so keep yoru fingers crossed that I will get enough sleep to prevent me from starting the new year at work as a wreck. Sweet dreams to all."

"event","I don't know where it comes from but I suffer from PCSS (Post Christmas Shopping Syndrom. After Christmas I always feel an urgent need to go shopping. Okay, I suppose I could call the SIN (Shoppers In Need) helpline or go to a SA (Shopaholics Anonymous) meeting but I've had enough therapy to be an unauthorized but very capable shrink myself so I know what's best for me: give in to this urge. It might not be best for my purse but it massages my soul so I went downtown. My medicines: the latest Baantjer (De Cock en de dood van de helende meesters) and a couple of cd's: Bob Dylan's ""The Times They are A-Changin'"" and ""Another Side of Bob Dylan"", Billy Joel's ""The ultimate collection"" (2cd) and John Lennon's  ""Imagine"" and ""Legend"". I also found some great Christmas cards (for next year) and I got a discount (buy 4, pay 3), which was good for my Dutch soul too. I was pretty satisfied when I got home. I am sure that I'll get PCSS again next year, without feeling guilty for giving in to it. Are there others who suffer from this syndrom? Should I go into therapy for it? Nah! Shopping is just very soothing at times. It might rise the premium for your purse health insurance but it's very good for the soul."

"event","My mood is very changable today. I have been through several kinds of moods today: silly, happy, sad, thoughtful, cheerful, annoyed, excited and probably a few more. I was very annoyed because my computer wouldn't play my new Bon Jovi cd (well, actually it's old because it's from 1985 but I only got it yesterday) and I have no idea why. All my cd's play on my computer. Billy Joel (Live in Russia, An innocent man and River of dreams) was perfect on my computer but Bon Jovi refused to give a sound. Grr. Why I just don't play it on my regular cd player? That often does funny and I have something with my discdrive at the moment but I might give it a shot anyway because I have to hear that cd. In a short time I am going to watch ""LoveLetters"", a gameshow, starting with 3 couple proposing and ending with the marriage of the winning couple. Although I don't intend to get married ever, I love this show. You know I am not very sane. Yep, Travel is luna. Bye lovelies. See you soon."

"event","My mood have changed. I just heard ""Goodnight Saigon"" and reminded how little of the Christmas thought ""Peace on earth"" have been fullfilled yet. There is still so much war in the world and this song always reminds me of that. The first time I heard ""Goodnight Saigon"" was 20 years ago, about the same time of year. I was 12 and hardly did know much English yet but this song and the clip what came with it, struck me. It showed the horror of war. Although this song is about Vietnam, it's for me the ultimate anti-war song and it's still accurate. In our world are yet so many wars. Every day people are dying in wars. I am against war. Nobody should suffer from such a thing. I have never been involved in a war but I've seen enough to know it's hell. Why can't we all respect eachother and live in peace? I really hope someday soon we all will live in peace. No more wars. It's Christmas, let there be peace on earth and every day of every year."

"event","Like I told Christmas was really nice. When I got home I worked on the LMAO ""Germany"" (nervousness)and prepared my last secret stargirl package. Tomorrow when the postoffice is open again, I'll put this stuff in the mail. Dec. 26 is a holiday over here too. I have been playing with new stamps and watching tv. There was a broadcast of ""Musicals in Ahoy"", a show from the Ahoy theater in Rotterdam with performances from popular musicals in The Netherlands. I missed a few things but there was a song from AIDA too. That was great. I saw AIDA 2 months ago. The show was great. I can imagine Ineke (a collegue who visited the event) had a great time. This morning I slept really late. It was nearly afternoon when I left my bed. Well, I've not slept all the time. I've been dozing too because I didn't want to get up yet. I had a rather exciting, romantic dream. I had a loveinterest named Jim and we were running away to celibrate his birthday. Actually it is pretty silly. I know who the guy is and I think he's a cutie but I don't know him personally and his birthday was 4 months ago. I must have had too much garlic butter yesterday. Chantal, what did you put in it? I have a new quiz. I closed the old one and created a new one. If you want to play: http://TravelFairy.friendtest.com is the place to find it. Today I'll just take it easy, doing things I like. Have a wonderful day!"

"event","I have just returned home after spending the day with my mom, Theo and Chantal. We really had a good time (far better than expected)together. Chantal had prepared some great food. The garlic butter, the ragout and the cheesecake were excellent. There were lots of presents and I got really spoilt: lots of candles, houseshoes, make-up, lots of stickers, socks, a 2003 cat diary, chocolate, a name keychain, cd's of Bon Jovi (7800 Fahrenheit) and Billy Joel (An innocent man, River of dreams and Live in Russia) and gelpens. I believe my gifts were much liked too. I guess this Christmas was a success. To me it was. Theo was coughing. He has a pretty bad cold. I hope it will be better soon. In 2 weeks from now we'll know if his battle against cancer is won. Keep your fingers crossed."

But I haven't a Christmas feeling yet. Maybe it's because it doesn't look like Christmas. There's no snow. It's just is grey outside and it isn't even very cold. Maybe I am just not a Christmas person or too much an anarchist. I am not playing Christmas songs. Most of them I don't like. Too sweet I guess. I am just playing Boudewijn. Call me weird.

"event","Today work has been very busy and chaotic. I am pretty much worn out. Well, 3 more days to work and then I have 2 full weeks off. Yippee! I still have to tell my mom and Chantal what I want to eat for Christmas. I'll call them tonight. I should call Theo too to ask how he's feeling. In 22 days we'll know if the chemotherapy was enough to ""kill"" the cancer. I am keeping my fingers crossed."

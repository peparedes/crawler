I am now living in a place where I care about very few and have found new meaning to the phrase ""cultural wasteland"".  I am working still working at a coffee shop which I feel may be the calling for the rest of my life if i never get my act together.  I am currently still telling people that i am going to go back to school, but in the fall because i could not get enrolled for the spring.  I have also put on weight(30 pounds)and people look down on you when you became fat.  I believe that fat people are lazy.... that is probably why i am stuck in misery/missouri and why this is also sporadic."

"event","So I went out to Cowboy's last night with one of my friends and he said that i looked like i put on some pounds.

I act like such a girl when people tell me I put on weight.  I freak out and start claiming that injustice has been done against me and that I am going on a diet tommorrow.

The problem with this is that I don't diet.  On top of this I have really been thinking about quitting smoking but usually people put on even more weight when they quit.  I really justify my smoking by explaining that I do not want to get fatter. 

""Fatty Travis"" is what they would call me.  Little kids would laugh and point as there mom's tell them that this is wrong even though they take one last look because Circus Freaks like ""Fatty Travis"" you usually have to pay to see, but one out in the real world is quite the treat.

I sometimes wonder if I could become really fat but I am so unhappy about the twenty or so pounds I have put on that I could not imagine putting on anymore.  I really just need to hit the breaking point where I will quit smoking, start working out, and eating a lot of salad(I do love salad or anything that involves Ranch).

Maybe I should eat and thank about all this a while."

"event","So I bought the first season of Will and Grace and I really loved every minute of it.  There is something about televisions shows involving gay people that are so much more interesting then there heterosexual counterparts.

A couple months ago I went through the same thing with Queer as Folk (which is much more open) and I really enjoyed watching that show.  I actually checked online a while ago to see when the third season comes out on DVD.

I hardly ever watch regular television but there is something more interesting about watching gay guys talk then straight ones.  Maybe it is the openness that I have had all my life, but I really think there should be more SMART gay shows out there to occupy my time.

Or maybe I could move out of this conservative city and have gay friends in real life again.  Maybe Massachusetts, they are probably all flocking there to get married.

Massachusetts being like Utah, but for homosexuals instead of mormons.  They should have had it in the same state so all the gay mormons could finally come out of the closet."

Of course we would have to buy more lights and change them every time the level is changed.  This would be a good way to keep everyone up to date about what is going on with terrorist.

This way when you are driving down the street having a good time and you look out your window and see orange lights you can realize that you should be doing you part as a citizen and look for potential terrorist.  Then everyone would have ""Christmas Terror Lights"" up.  That way the people that did not would be Un-American and we could report these people as terrorist. 

Do they make t-shirts advertising the different terror alerts?  Maybe we could add a mascot to each color and they can show up to sporting events and concerts.  The really patriotic people could wear face paint every time it changes just to let everyone know what is going on."

"event","So I went to go see The Return of The King at the old theater downtown on opening night, where you get to go stand in line outside before the movie (we have done it all three years, it makes you appreciate the movies that much more).  

So behind us are these three guys right in the height of their high school career who cut in line where there is this ugly girl saving them a spot.  Why can't they stand in the back and have her save them seats inside like everyone else does?  If you are going to cheat the system atleast do it with some tact like everyone else.

So they join her in line right behind us and they start making up these ""raps"" about Lord of the Rings and everything else that happened in their day.  They were absolutely horrible, they had no rhythm, and the guy that was making up the beat was laughing to hard to even keep up.  Then there was the fact that it was slow, that their brains were sent into overdrive to make up these horrific rhymes.  

So I was there with five of my friends (all bigger guys) and one of the outspoken ones about ten minutes into it says in a loud tone ""I really don't want to have to get into a fight right before the movie just because the people behind us are so stupid"".  

So this shut them up, which was really good because I was ready to join in.  I have never been in a fight and never really plan ever being in a fight but this would have been a worthy cause.  These guys deserved to be beaten.  I probably not being the one to inflict serious damage but atleast I would feel safe doing a worthy cause for humanity.   

I was thinking about how after the fight we could have lit them on fire and everyone would cheer because not only did we take care of the stupid people in line we also provided a method for keeping everyone in the line warm.  Sure they would have to deal with the screaming and yelling out in pain but that would be nothing to the ""rap"" session that they were putting on earlier."

"event","So my mother is crazy.  One day I will call my parents and everything will be fine.  We will have a good conversation based upon non confrontational topics; these topics include where I work, what I eat, whether I have a girlfriend (always no whether I do or not), and how my roommate is doing.  The problem is they will creep in things like school, politics, money, and religion, which I will be forced to try and quickly change the subject with only infinitesimal success.

The problem is that I am a disrespective problem child that does not care about his parents.  My parents base caring upon how expensive the gift I give them for all major holidays and birthdays.  Now I could try and do the devious thing and spend some money on gifts in exchange for them paying for school, but I cannot sacrifice myself to that demeaning of a lifestyle.  Why?  My parents send me letters reminding me that I need to buy them gifts.  I do not need to buy anyone a gift andI will never buy a gift for someone if they tell me I need to.  It is not a gift at that point, it is an obligation.  I was alright with knowing that it was an obligation as long as they didn't point it out to me.  It all changes when they send me letters stating the point, now it is obvious for both of us what I am being forced to do to receive my parent's financial support and love.  Financial support being the thing of actual importance because I believe I gave up caring whether they loved me or not a long time ago.   It was probably around the point that I was moving out and my mother told me I was adopted and so not her real son and she wished I was aborted to begin with.  That usually does it!

So last weekend I asked them for the money for school next semester.  This being part of a 6 month plan to get on their good side in an attempt to get the money to go back to school.  So my mom is nice enough to point out that I need to change my attitude before I am going to get anything from them.  Where would this come from?  I talk to them once a month (me calling them) and it is all mundane shit.   How do they know anything about my fucking attitude.  Oh, wait a sec, here it comes. 

""You didn't buy me or your father a Christmas gift last year"", my mother states.

This is when I decide to lose it.  There is nothing like horrible parents that can make you reach the edge of hysteria.  ""Well, maybe this is because you left my sisters wedding!  I bought you a gift (which I didn't) but you didn't stay for my sisters wedding.  You being the parents did not show up to your only daughters wedding.  You have no right to ever complain to me about not treating you fairly when you have done one of the worst things you could possibly do to one of your children.""

Well it went downhill from there.  The phone call ended with them telling me that they would have to think about giving me money for school.  The good thing about it all is I don't care.  They have issues and I am not ever going to let them hold me back in life because that is what they want.  They want me to fail miserably and come crawling back.  It will never happen!"

I even want to have the sensation of scolding espresso drip onto my hand and remembering the tingling feeling it left my hand with afterwards.  I want to be a barista.  

I do not want to be burrito boy.  There is nothing cool about making a burrito for someone.   For one thing they are fucking huge.  You cannot hit on  someone when they are about to gorge their face.  (Although you can get an o-face pretty figured out, but that is just me being creepy)

I like being there when boyfriends bring a date in though.  The girl will order one taco and her date will commence with the mockery.   The problem with the mockery though is that he doesn't want her to get fat. 

What if she started eating ginourmous burritos, to the point that they were bigger then yours?  Wouldn't you have to question your manhood if your girlfriend ate more then you all the time? 

Then when she starts eating the genormous burritos to appease you, you can not get her to stop eating, you can't go the other way and talk about how she eats so much and make oinking sounds at her.  You are stuck.  If you had any brains at all you would accept the one taco for what it was, her obsession with staying skinny."

"event","So alot of my friends have been saying that I have been going through a ""depression thing"" lately.  I never knew this until one of my friends called from London and the first thing she asked me is ""why are you so depressed?""

I wanted a ""hello, what have you been up to"" and then maybe lay into me but she just started right in.  Then the main accuser was sitting right beside me at the time so I really was at a point to even discuss the notion.

Well here is why they think that:
1.  My cousin/roommate has now officially moved out and I lived alone for about 3 months.
2.  I have no girlfriend and I keep dwelling about past girlfriends.
3.  I am not in school right now.

So I take all these things for boredom.  I am not depressed, I am just not inspired.   I do have the tendency to stay up hysterically late.  This is only because boredom has kicked in and I refuse to believe that my day is over until something has actually happened.

Maybe i need to find inner peace.  I think i should start volunteering.   I will definitely do something though; i will atleast try to pay more attention to what other people are talking about."

Then we were talking about sex and in my spanish blunders I said this girl was hot, but it came out that she was horny.  Then I was talking about a girl at my work and I said she likes to have sex but got the ending wrong.  So it came out that she like to have sex with women.

All the people I work with have to go home and talk about the stupid white boss that speaks gringo (sp?) spanish.  I do this constantly!

"event","So my old assistant manager came over tonight after work and had some drinks with me.  This is not really important but tells how I am drunk.

What I really want to talk about is Lindsey. Lindsey is asleep right now because she sleeps at normal hours and does not take phone call from me anymore at 1:30 in the morning, probably because I am drunk (word slurred for emphasis).

So a couple of days ago (exactly 3, if you are counting today) she told me that I think are friendship is ending.  Now this sucks for two reasons:
1.  All i have done since she told me this is make me obsessively think about why she said this.
2.  Makes me question the fact that I have said everything there is to say to her and that everything else is just regurgitated shit thrown at her with a twist in order to sound interesting again.

Me and Lindsey!  Lindsey and I!  Us... oh wait, there has never been an us and there will probably never be an us.

Lindsey is my telefono amiga!  She is the girl that I call and talk to everyday on the phone but never actually hang out with in person, except for the times when she comes into my work and every guy I work tries to explain how I am the luckiest guy to ever live.

The point is that nothing ever goes further with Lindsey because:
1.  We are friends who rarely hang out in person.
2.  What would happen to the friendship?
3.  I for some reason feel the need to hit on her in idiotic ways lately probably making myself unappealing in the end. 
4.  I have issues with being poor and driving a piece of shit car.
5.  We both are constantly talking about someone else.  This either being because there is actually a valid someone else or because there is someone else that would never work but is safer because we can discard the someone else after the relationship is over.

My point is that I think that at some point we should try US!  Not because it will definitely work in the end.  Because you are my dearest friend and if you did move on with someone else I would always wonder what could have been.  It is worth the friendship because the friendship will live on.  It will change, but that change will only make our friendship grow no matter what the outcome."

One of my friends (Derrick)told me to drive up to his house and then he wasn't there.  He was nice enough not to tell me until I had been waiting in my car for 45 minutes.  So then I felt I had to do something but didn't know what because I only had a limited amount of time.  So I sat and thought about it for an a hour and then Lindsey call me back (YEAH).  I spent most of the time talking to her about how i really should be doing something (I do not qualify talking on the phone as doing something).  Then she put me on hold, only to call me back an hour later right when I was about to go to bed.  She calls me back and she was talking to this guy she just met who she felt was more important then talking to me?  Well I must let her know that she was wrong.  This guy will be forgotten, we will make fun of him later; we will laugh and question his sexuality.  

I will hate myself in the morning?

Atleast coffee will have that much more of an appeal.

"event","So I have this freakish idea that any girl I have dated should die the day after we break up.   This way I would neither have to thank about getting back with her or think about wether she is thinking about getting back with me.  It would also be a good conversation piece of coping and pity for the next relationship; the new girlfriend not being able to get jealous of my past relationship because the girl is dead and you have issues if your are jealous of a dead person.

So I was working (burrito joint, I added joint to make a bad situation better) today and it was really slow because apparently it is Columbus Day and appearently people don't have to work, except for me, or eat.  So I decide that I will go out back and have a cigarette for the sole purpose of killing time.  I sometimes think I will die from smoking from the ability for it to kill time at mind numbing jobs.  So I go back to the front and there she is....

She was coming in to pick up food for a fellow employee and I was the one that got to make it for her.   Now it is bad enough to run into a girl that I used to date, but it makes it worse when she comes into to order food at the place where you work.  Atleast she ordered a quesadilla which makes it more ok in my head.  So we talk while she is waiting for the quesadilla to melt.  Why did she order a quesadilla?  They take so fucking long to cook.  Why isn't anyone going over there and pressing on the damn tortilla press so it will cook?   I should go... no I shouldn't it will look like i am avoiding talking to her.  Do I want to talk to her?   Why didn't  she die, then I wouldn't be in this situation.

Me:  So you should call me!

It was forced,  i shouldn't have said it.  Why is she so undeniable appaeling?  Why did we brake up in the first place?  I think we should have gotten married!  I am only 21, I don't want to get married.

Her:   Well I have your number, Derrick came into my work with his girlfriend a couple of days ago and he gave it to me.  Derrick that is his name right?

Ofcourse that is his fucking name.  You know that is his name, don't play that I blocked Travis and anything to do with Travis out of my life bullshit with me.I haven't dated this girl for over a year, what are my friends doing giving her my number a year later.  Have I talked about her lately.... alright, have i talked about her a lot lately.  Do I have issues?  She either has to think that I am crazy or Derrick is crazy.  She can't even remember his name, it hassss to be me?

Her:  I will definetly call you!  

She won't call!  But definetly, that is a good sign.  Do I even want her to call?  Well atleast I have a real reason to go and have a cigarette now."

Really all i want is for someone to talk to me about the beauty of life.  I want to be inspired by the people around me.  I want to have a conversation about fall!"

"event","So my frined/roommate all but lives with his girlfriend.  This meaning that he does live with his grilfriend, but he still pays rent and concievably has a room (mostly for storage now) that  is well suited for sleeping in.  

So he lives here in the sense that he pays for a place that he is at for an two hours a week, which is usually spent watching a Netflix movie that he has never seen before.  So in a way he is paying 20 times the amount he should to watch, at most, five movies a month.  

The problem in this is that he jokes around about the situation with ideas of how I should get a new roomate who would get more out of the situation then ridicously priced rental fees. 

My thoughts are that it is his on fault for falling in love and that he should have to suffer the consequences of deciding to live with her.  That if he was not so foolish and weak minded that he would realize the common civility of keeping the relationship at a slow enough speed, that inevitably (before living with her) he will coming crying to me at the end of it all.  

This is not to say that I am against relationships, or even against my cousin having a relationship.

I am against him damaging his own life in order to make things work with one random girl.

I guess if i was in the same situation though... oh, that's right, i care about my friends.  I wonder where he is going to live when the whole thing is over?"

"event","I feel like this should be the best entry I ever had.  This should be the entry that is so good, that it will forgive all other entries despite what is said.  The only problem is that I am a newby to live journal and to any journal at all for  that matter so i will probably have to hope for a later date for some sort of dramatically great insight into the world.  

So instead i will talk about working out, because that is what I did before coming home.  I like working out for the trully humbling experience that it gives me.  No where else am  I so completely retarded and out of my element.  The one cool thing about working out is that my work out ""buddy"" is a guy from my work who knows everything about working out from going to the gym all the time and being an ex army guy.  
The cool thing about this is the whole time I am giving my feeble attempts to redefine my body structure by lifting a bar up and down Josh is screaming such things as... 
""come on player""- this one is my favorite just for the fact that I could never use the world player without it coming out like i am the whitest man to ever live
""one more baby""- this one is good because it motivates me while also making me questions of wether he calls his girlfriend baby because i could see that happening
 ""this one is for the ladies""- okay this one is a little wierd because although i work out to  become sexy, i do not want to think about them while holding a giant bar over my head
""this one is you""-this one is the worst because everytime he says this it is only because it is not me, it will never be me, and if it was me I wouldn't of probably needed him there in the first place."

Okay, I accept that I am all that is female, though I don't often act like it. I'm pretty damn low maintenance, even more-so now that I have old people who tell me I'm gorgeous even without make-up. But, I digress.
 
 The one thing I cannot stand is hairy legs. My god, the feeling of a caterpillar on my legs is not appealing. It weirds me out when guys say they don't notice that kind of thing, because I do. But on the other hand, I also hate shaving my legs. So what is a girl to do? Why, wax of course!
 
 Of course, being as low maintenance as I am, I'm not going to pay good money to have some ""expert"" wax my legs! I mean, it's a large area. Not like eyebrows. I can't screw that shit up. Have you ever seen my legs? The circumference of my calves is approximate to that of my best friend's waist. There's no way this could end badly.
 
 So! I take a week to grow out my leg hair as long as it needs to be to be pulled out. This was probably the most torturous part of the process. Being as classy as I am, I still strutted around in my short shorts with my leg hair about a quarter inch long. Let's be honest, I have no one to impress.
 
 I decided today would be the day. I went to Sally's Beauty Supply to buy some wax. Mistake #1: I bought microwavable wax. This shit gets all over EVERYTHING AND WON'T COME OFF. Mistake #2: I did not buy extra cloths in addition to the wax. Mistake #3: I decided waxing my own legs was a good idea. But hey, I'm $16 closer to achieving my dream of smooth legs.
 
 I get this tiny kit of joy home and pop the wax in the microwave. It's similar to the consistency of honey and smells like chemical death + hemp. I apply the pre-wax solution (smells like alcohol to me)... and set out on my incredible journey. I find out soon that the feeling of hot wax on your legs isn't so pleasant, but by this point I have no choice but to apply the strip. I smooth it down going WITH the direction of the hair. I rip AWAY from the root.
 
 OW. But not as bad as one might expect. I look down at the strip, fascinated by all the tiny legs hairs with the roots still attached. But wait... the wax is green... why is the strip brown? I look at my leg. I look at the strip. I just removed about seven layers of my skin. I can see my own dermis. Huh. Welp, I'll try again. We will consider the next 15 strips mistakes 4-18. Alas, I ran out of strips, so I've only finished 1 leg. I will continue my torture tomorrow.
 
 Mistake #19: Buy water soluble wax. I keep sticking to the carpet and other various surfaces, thus ripping out more leg hairs.
 
 The point of the story is that I suck at waxing. My legs are bruised and not the smooth beauties I expected them to be. I'm getting ready to go on a date tonight... I think I'll wear shorts to show off my newly sexed-up legs.
 
 Ugh. Being a girl sucks."

I dont really think its finished...but here it is.

**
feeling breathless
as he slides down my body
i look into his eyes
what do i see
is it love
is it lust
i dont care
the feel of his hands on me
the feel of his heart beating so hard agasint mine
i can give him my all"

"event","This poem was chosen to be in a book of various poetic authors.....The book is as of now going to be called IMMORTAL VERSUS but they said it could change. It also may look famaliar, I posted the true version of it earlier on here, I had to cut it short in order for it to be allowed admittance into the competition so this is the revised shorter version. ENJOY

Did You Ever Think
by : ME CHARLOTTE 

This is an inquest 
If you dare to respond
There is a light at the end of the tunnel 
So you walk towards the light
Or turn and hurridly run the other way
Do you sit in the corner
Contemplating what really happened to your life
Thinking about yesterdays
Reminising about the past
That you had forgotten so long ago
Is there sorrow in your eyes
From the tears that have plagued you
For centuries we have all been the same
For a lifetime there is no change in who we are
We have become
The epitomy of what is hated
And shunned out of every community 
Did you ever think 
As to what sanity really was"

"event","The two lovers stand out in the rain. He looks deep into her eyes and kisses her soft pale crimson lips. She weakens in his arms and is captivated by the emotion that runs through them both, as they stand, in the storm embraced. After a minute of sensual kissing he nibbles her bottom lip, looks deeply into her eyes and tells her ""I love you."" She melts, almost instantly, she has been waiting to hear these words from him for so long. A tear begins to fall down her already drenched face. He asks her ""What is wrong love?"" She replies ""Nothing, just happy, and caught off guard."" 

As they walk back to the car hand in hand they hear screeching tires. He pushes her out of the way just in time. The truck strikes him and throws him into the air. When he hit the ground, she knew he was dead. There was nothing she could do. She wished that it would have been her instead. She had waited so long to hear him say those three simple words, to feel the way that she did. And when that night, that perfect October night came, he was taken from her so selfishly.

Did you ever think
As to what sanity really was
When you sat at your desk
Hair in a pretty pink bow
Did you ever think to look for your innocence
And conform 
Make everything okay once again for yourself
People call you selfish
You only think about yourself
And no one will ever care about you
Because you do not care about them
A piece of integrity dangling 
Like a rotten corpse, strung up in the town square
To warn of the dangers behind breaking the rules
Did you ever think 
That I would die
Did you ever think 
That you could push me to the side
In this rhapsody of your life
I am the voice inside
And no it will never be okay

"event","I didn&#39;t get a chance to watch the new episode until today because of internet problems due to bad weather, but the wait was definitely worth it. This episode was AWESOME! I would say it was probably the best episode of the entire <i>Crystal</i> series (first season included) so far.<lj-cut>From Chibi-Usa&#39;s and Pluto&#39;s touching reunion, to Hotaru&#39;s heartbreaking backstory, to the incredible Inners vs. Outers battle, to that evil (but perfect) cliffhanger... LOVED IT! I just had two really minor things that I would have changed that are really just me being picky. First is that if only one senshi was going to get a transformation sequence this episode, I would have preferred seeing Pluto transform, rather than seeing Uranus&#39;s again, as pretty as it is. Kinda makes me worried that we might not get a Pluto transformation sequence, since I see no reason to delay showing it since everybody already knows who Setsuna is. The second thing is REALLY picky, but when Hotaru has her vision of Setsuna, Haruka, and Michiru, I wish Michiru was dressed in black and white like the other two. (Although her green dress was cute!) I think that would have worked better for the vibe of the scene. But, yeah, picky.</lj-cut>"

I do wish that Helios was a part of this set as well, but hopefully there will be more SuperS sets in the future. I could see them doing an Amazoness Quartet set next, then maybe one with Helios, Nehelenia, and Zirconia (maybe Chibi-Usa in princess form?).

"event","Loved this episode of <i>Crystal</i>! It was rather fast-paced, but considering that this chapter in the manga is <i>really</i> long, that&#39;s to be expected. (I don&#39;t think they even got through all of the chapter yet.)<lj-spoiler>There were some nice moments for minor characters, like Reika and Motoki&#39;s interactions with Setsuna and Kyousuke giving the Sailor Moon cup he made to Chibi-Usa as their classmates draw the obvious conclusion. I also loved the scene where Minako comes to visit Makoto and Makoto ends up attacking the evil flower with a knife. Huh, I know there was a lot more that I wanted to talk about, but there was so much that happened that I can&#39;t even remember it all. Oh, well. The best part of all, though, is that Pluto is officially back in action! The &quot;floating&quot; scene was lovely, and I liked how even Mamoru could sense that she had reawakened. (Probably due to his ever growing psychic abilities, but you could also use it as shipping fuel...) And perfect ending for the episode with Pluto calmly saying &quot;Dead Scream&quot; and defeating Tellu even after Sailor Moon&#39;s attack failed. </lj-spoiler>"

"event","Another fantastic episode of <i>Crystal</i> this week, with the debut of a new version of the OP song, a brand new ED song, and new transformations for Uranus and Neptune! I&#39;m still not totally in love with the OP, but I gotta say the new singer is a lot better than the person who sang it before. Now I kinda like it. The new ED is sung by Chibi-Usa and is SUPER CUTE, although I can&#39;t help but feel that it seems really out of place when this season is so dark. The Haruka/Michiru duet worked better as an ending. As for the new transformations, they basically kept the same exact choreography as from the original anime, which is kinda disappointing, but they look really gorgeous otherwise. Moving on to the episode itself, the second half was actually really quite exciting. I think that was about the best battle of the series so far!<lj-cut text=""Spoilers for the very end of the episode and next week's episode"">And Pluto&#39;s back!

In other news, I did something a little -- okay, a lot -- nuts yesterday. There was a listing on eBay for this very rare <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/Sailor-Moon-1995-Bandai-Plushie-/322087012772?_trksid=p2047675.l2557&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&amp;nma=true&amp;si=Gak4BHZe%252B5xLb2YfxbYszVjFfGg%253D&amp;orig_cvip=true&amp;rt=nc"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Carillon plush that can transform into Pegasus</a> when you turn it inside out, which I&#39;ve been wanting ever since I first came across a picture of it on one of my favorite Sailor Moon collectibles sites. The seller was asking $299 for it, but was also accepting Best Offers. Well, about five or six hours before the listing was set to end, I decided to throw caution to the wind and send in an offer of $100, never expecting it to be accepted but figuring it wouldn&#39;t hurt to at least try. The listing ended without me hearing anything back about my offer, so I assumed that was it. However, a few hours later, I got a message from the seller asking if I would be willing to go up to $130. I didn&#39;t <i>really</i> want to pay that much to be honest, but there was no telling when or if I would ever get another opportunity like that again. I mean, it was still new in the box and the only one I&#39;ve ever seen offered up for sale. Based on its apparent rarity, plus knowing what other Pegasus items tend to go for (A LOT), I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was really worth $200-plus, so how could I possibly pass up the chance to buy it for that price? (Plus, I was still disappointed about losing out on that other Pegasus plush I mentioned a few entries back which ended up selling for $172.) So...I did! It&#39;s pretty much the most expensive single item I&#39;ve ever bought for myself, but I&#39;m calling it my reward for finally finishing <i>Melting Ice</i>. (Speaking of which, the last chapter has been posted at FF.net, AO3, and <lj user=""oyster_shell"" />.) Definitely no more buying stuff on eBay for a while, though. My wallet can&#39;t take it!"

"event","New episode of <i>Crystal</i> is out! Still really loving this season. Not really much to say about the episode itself, but I do think everybody&#39;s clothes at the concert were gorgeous. Oh, and it was Minako&#39;s turn to be the most adorable character -- loved all her fangirling! It was also fun to see her use her Sailor V compact. I always loved Mercury&#39;s Aqua Mirage from the &quot;Ami&#39;s First Love&quot; special, so it was nice to see <i>Crystal</i>&#39;s version of the attack, which was lovely as well. I will say that there were some really strange translation issues in the subtitles, namely Michiru saying her mirror isn&#39;t such a &quot;sweet stuff&quot;, but, eh, you can&#39;t really expect perfect subtitles for a simulcast anyway. Hopefully they will clean that up for the physical release.

"event","Another good episode of Crystal, although perhaps not quite as great as the first two episodes. I will say Makoto was the literal cutest in almost every scene she was in -- even when she was pissed off! Also, there was some really great background music, especially the piece that played while Rei was meditating underneath the waterfall. Oh, and Mars&#39;s new attack was pretty cool, too. I am a little disappointed, though, that they missed an opportunity to mention some of Rei&#39;s backstory that was completely skipped over in the first two seasons, especially since this episode takes place on Rei&#39;s birthday. I&#39;ve given up hope that the &quot;Casablanca Memory&quot; sidestory will ever be animated, but it would have been nice to include a scene early in the episode where Rei&#39;s father (or, more likely, a secretary or assistant) calls to invite her to her usual birthday dinner, only for her to tell him that she already has plans. Then maybe have some flashbacks to Kaidou and/or her mother&#39;s death, or something like that... Well, anyway, that wasn&#39;t in the manga anyway, so it&#39;s not really like it&#39;s a complaint or a mistake, but that&#39;s what I would have done if I was in charge of writing the episode. Unfortunately, they didn&#39;t ask me. :P I will say that if -- WHEN -- they get to the Dream arc, Rei&#39;s episode better have backstory GALORE!&nbsp;"

First up, a package that just came in today: Christmas Petit Charas! I&#39;ve been wanting these ever since they were first announced, but I wasn&#39;t sure about spending so much money on something so seasonal. Finally just decided to bite the bullet and get them. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re so Christmas-y that they can&#39;t be enjoyed all year round, right? Well, that&#39;s what I&#39;m telling myself anyway...

Next we have a six inch Sailor Pluto Adventure Doll to go with the 11.5 inch one I bought a while back. Spent a little more than I ideally would have wanted to pay for such a small doll ($42), but the one with the black fuku is much harder to find than the silver fuku, so I think it&#39;s a fair price.

<lj-cut text=""More pics under the cut"">Third is the Atsumete Sailor Pluto figure, which I&#39;m thrilled to finally own. My local Books-a-Million sells all the other senshi, but for some reason, they never have Pluto in stock. After several months of waiting for her to come in, I decided to just buy her off eBay. Best part was that this one was on sale, so I actually came out cheaper than had I bought her at BAM, even with the shipping. Isn&#39;t she so cute?

Here&#39;s another lucky eBay find. This pen originally came in a set with Uranus and Neptune versions as well, but the only one I really wanted was the Pluto one, so I was happy when I came across a listing just selling the Pluto pen. Snapped it up right away!

And lastly, some figures of the Inner Senshi from the 90s&#39;. I&#39;m not positive, but I strongly suspect that they may be bootlegs, unfortunately, due to the fact that Venus&#39;s front bow is dark purple instead of the blue it should be and Mars was very sticky when I took her out of the box, as if she had been repainted. Oh, well, not much I can do about it now. They&#39;re still cute enough to display.

Strange that I never really noticed! Still nice to see in color, though. I liked that it was black and gold. We also got to see Chibi Moon&#39;s transformation sequence for the first time -- cute! Love the character designs of Kaolinite and the Witches 5; they&#39;re all gorgeous. Kaolinite&#39;s voice bugged me a little, though. It&#39;s kinda...nasally, I guess?

"event","<div>Now that my hand has healed well enough that I can type (mostly) painfree, here are my thoughts on the past anime season. No real spoilers except the one that is marked.

<i>Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju</i> - This show was so GOOD! My definite favorite of the Winter season and possibly worthy of a 10/Masterpiece rating. (A second season was announced, so I won&#39;t call it just yet.) Seriously, though, if there was an Emmy for anime series, I&#39;m pretty sure it would win in a landslide victory. I was particularly impressed with the voice work. Since the show revolves around rakugo -- Japanese storytelling -- the ability to be able to act several parts while the the characters do their routines is amazing.</div><div><i>Snow White With The Red Hair, Season Two</i> - Just as charming as the first season! It&#39;s a bit of a shame that Shirayuki and Zen had to spend most of these episodes apart, but other than that, it was great. I particularly loved the development that Raj went though. Who knew he had it in him?</div><div>
<i>ERASED</i> - The beginning of this show started out great, but it kinda lost steam in the second half, especially with the extremely generic &quot;bad guys&quot;. Still better than the other mysteries I&#39;ve watched lately, though.</div><lj-spoiler><div>(One thing that bothered me is that no explanation is ever given for Satoru&#39;s &quot;Revival&quot; (the ability to travel back in time to save someone&#39;s life) powers in a world that is otherwise completely mundane. You kind of just have to go with it.)</div></lj-spoiler>

<div><i>Nurse Witch Komugi R</i> - I watched the original OAV of this a long time ago and apparently didn&#39;t care for it much based on the 5 I gave it, but I actually really liked this expanded revival series! I mean, it&#39;s nothing special, but it&#39;s still pretty fun to watch.</div><div>
<i>Sekko Boys</i> - This eight-minute show was absolutely ridiculous...but in the best kind of way. I&#39;m still wondering what the creators were smoking when they came up with the idea of a show about an idol group consisting of statue busts. It shouldn&#39;t work, yet somehow it does.</div><div>
<i>She and Her Cat -Everything Flows-</i> - Another eight-minute show that was pretty good. Basically, if you&#39;ve ever seen the original short film &quot;She and Her Cat&quot; and liked it, you&#39;ll probably enjoy these four episodes as well.</div><div>
And I can&#39;t believe the Spring season has already started! Isn&#39;t there usually like a week or two break between seasons? I haven&#39;t even picked out all the shows I want to watch yet. Of course I&#39;ll be watching <i>Sailor Moon Crystal Season 3</i>, and I&#39;ve watched the first episode of <i>Ace Attorney</i>, which was pretty amusing. (Always wanted to play one of the games, but I&#39;ve never owned a console that plays any.) As for other shows... <i>Haven&#39;t You Heard? I&#39;m Sakamoto</i>, <i>My Hero Academia</i>, and <i>Flying Witch</i> sound like good bets, so those are going on the list. (Oh, and I&#39;m also watching the dub of <i>Dimension W</i>, which is technically from the Winter season, on Toonami. Since it&#39;s a half-season behind, I decided not to include it with the other Winter shows.)</div>"

Loved pretty much everything about it but the new opening song, which was...eh. I also really like the new transformation sequences, especially the fact that Mercury's was so figure skating inspired.

Speaking of skating, last weekend was the World Championships, where my all-time favorite Ashley Wagner finally ended the decade-long drought of American ladies not being on the podium by winning silver with two incredible performances. *dances* I'm so, so happy and proud of her!

And Evgenia Medvedeva, the girl who placed ahead of her to take the title? She's a Sailor Moon fan!

<lj-embed id=""12""/>

The relevant moment takes place around the 1:25 mark. She recites the Japanese lyrics of Moonlight Densetsu, then says in English that she's watched the first four seasons of the original anime and really liked the show. I was already a huge fan of Evgenia's skating, but now I love her even more!

And somebody really should do a Sailor Moon on Ice show someday..."

First off, a rather timely purchase with <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-03-02/clamp-to-publish-new-cardcaptor-sakura-manga/.99295"" target=""_blank"">the announcement that CLAMP is planning a new Card Captor Sakura short story</a> --&nbsp;two absolutely ADORABLE Sakura figures. The slightly larger one on the left is a Girls Memories figure I bought from the Crunchyroll store, while the smaller one was another one of those annoying Petit Chara blind boxes that I found at Books-a-Million, but this time I didn&#39;t mind since of the six figures in the series, five of them were Sakura and all of them were just the cutest, so I was pretty much guaranteed to get one that I wanted. (And I wouldn&#39;t have minded the Tomoyo figure either.)

Next up is a purchase I&#39;m REALLY excited about, since there&#39;s not a whole lot of <i>Kaleido Star</i> merchandise out there, and even less available from American sellers on eBay, so she was a very lucky find. *squeals* Granted, it&#39;s kind of a strange pose (I think it&#39;s supposed to be a pose from her famous Golden Phoenix act), and the base is rather scratched up, and I&#39;m not sure why they decided to color the top of the costume blue when the one she wore in the actual show was red...but it&#39;s LAYLA FREAKIN&#39; HAMILTON!

Good news is, I think I&#39;m starting to get out of the writer&#39;s block I&#39;ve been having on that chapter, so I hope it won&#39;t be too long before it&#39;s finished. *crosses fingers*

"event","I just wanted to show off some really cool <i>Sailor Moon</i> stuff I recently bought from eBay (all from the same seller) that came in today. (Don&#39;t mind the glitter... That&#39;s where my Christmas tree was, and I haven&#39;t gotten around to cleaning it up yet. They&#39;re not going to stay there anyway.)

Pretty awesome, right? I&#39;m especially in love with the Super Sailor Moon karaoke machine, circa probably the mid-90s. I had to pay close to $50 for her, but it was definitely worth it. She&#39;d never really been taken out of the box, so she was still in working order. When you press her brooch, it plays an instrumental version of <i>Moonlight Densetsu</i> that you can sing along with. What&#39;s funny is that I first came across her on this <a href=""http://www.sailormoontoyscollection.com/"" target=""_blank"">French Sailor Moon collection site</a> a couple of weeks ago and instantly fell in love, but figured I would never find one for sale. So imagine how happy I was when one actually did show up on eBay -- and at a fairly reasonable price to boot! The other three items are a Pluto magnet, a Pluto cell phone strap, and another fun item: a SuperS jigsaw puzzle/dry erase board, all from the 90s as well, I believe. Definitely old merchandise, but in great condition.

<lj-cut text=""Close-up pics""><img alt="""" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/heavenly_pearl/8290510/22390/22390_original.png"" title="""" /> On the left is the magnet, on the right is the cell phone strap.

<img alt="""" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/heavenly_pearl/8290510/22971/22971_original.png"" title="""" /> Y&#39;all know I&#39;m a sucker for anything with Pegasus on it! The dry erase board is on the flip side, but it&#39;s nothing special so I didn&#39;t bother to take a picture. It&#39;s not even Sailor Moon-y, with just a border of fruit, but I do like the idea of a two-in-one item..

<img alt="""" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/heavenly_pearl/8290510/23056/23056_original.png"" title="""" /> And the karaoke machine... Isn&#39;t she just one of the cutest things you&#39;ve ever seen?!

In other exciting news, I won a $25 gift certificate to Right Stuf, thanks to the Christmas giveaway over at one of my favorite manga review sites, <a href=""http://mangatestdrive.blogspot.com/"" target=""_blank"">Manga Test Drive</a>.&nbsp;Would have been nice to have during their Christmas sale, but I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t have any trouble finding something else to spend it on!"

"event","Last day of 2015 and I still haven&#39;t finished the last chapter of <i>Melting Ice</i>... Oops. I do have quite a bit of it written, though, including the scene I was most dreading to write: the actual performance of the Lovers&#39; Maneuver. I don&#39;t like writing action scenes so I expected to have a terrible time with it, but it actually came to me pretty easily. It&#39;s the romance part I&#39;m having trouble with. Well, anyway, I really do plan to finish the story in 2016 (aiming right now for Valentine&#39;s Day), so hopefully this will be the absolute last time I make a New Year&#39;s promise to complete it.

Now, onto my final thoughts on the anime I watched this season. For me, this was the weakest season of the year, with only one title that I would consider buying if given a physical release. The rest were okay (except for <i>Diabolic Lovers</i>), but nothing I have the desire to rewatch. No real spoilers, but I&#39;ll cut anyway.

<lj-cut text=""In no particular order"">
<b>One Punch Man</b> - Everybody and their mother seems to love this show, but for me, I found it pretty average overall. When it comes to superhero anime, something like <i>Tiger &amp; Bunny</i> is more suited to my taste, I guess. <i>OPM </i>was amusing enough, and I can appreciate that it was very well-animated, but the art style didn&rsquo;t really appeal to me and the characters were all rather flat and one-note. I also didn&rsquo;t like the fact that there was only one female hero/character of note, and she was rather annoying. (Although she did have the coolest powers, which was something, I guess.) Definitely a testosterone fest!

<b>The Perfect Insider</b> - This show was&hellip;weird. Disturbing, even. On the plus side, it actually kept me interested for most of the show, which is more than I can say for last season&rsquo;s <i>Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers</i>, which had a similar locked-room mystery, but as for the conclusion&hellip; Well, bonus points for originality, but a bit too unbelievable. And, again, very, very disturbing.

<b>Beautiful Bones - Sakurako&rsquo;s Investigation</b> - - It was fine. That&rsquo;s about all I can really say about it. It was pleasant enough to watch, just not very interesting, which is too bad since the premise sounded a bit like the TV show <i>Bones</i>, and I like <i>Bones</i>.

<b>Aria the Scarlet Ammo AA</b> - Well, this was certainly different from the first season! In the first season, the main character was a guy who became like James Bond whenever he was aroused, so of course there was quite a bit of fan service and he had a harem of girls after him. In this season, that guy only shows up in a couple of brief cameos, and the main character becomes a new girl who is obsessed/in love with the titular Aria (who is strangely not really the main character in either series). Both seasons are fun enough to watch, but nothing special.

<b>Diabolic Lovers</b> - I have to admit that this new season was a little more bearable to watch than the first one, thanks to the fact that the new vampires are at least a little sympathetic and don&rsquo;t treat Yui as terribly as the vampires from the first season did, but still&hellip; This just isn&rsquo;t a good show. (And the season ends on a cliffhanger, which probably means yet another season is in the works... *sigh*)

<b>Dance with Devils</b> - This is the one show from this season I really liked, which is weird because it&lsquo;s very similar to <i>Diabolik Lovers</i> except instead of vampires, it&lsquo;s devils. But Ritsuka actually does have a bit of backbone, and the devils, while not exactly prime healthy boyfriend material, don&rsquo;t treat her anywhere near as bad as the vampires do Yui in <i>DL</i>. It also helps that that the show doesn&rsquo;t take itself too seriously. I mean, chanting Pomeranians -- come on! It was a little disappointing that after the first episode they cut the musical numbers down to one per episode, but at least the musical numbers were well done with great songs. And again, chanting Pomeranians.</lj-cut>

As for next season, I&#39;m definitely looking forward to the next season of Snow White With The Red Hair, and I&#39;m tentively planning to check out Erased, Rainbow Days, and maybe Sekko Boys. Oh, and <i>Nurse Witch Komugi-chan R</i>, but only because I watched the original (which I didn&#39;t like) and now feel obligated to watch the sequel. (Maybe it&#39;ll be better with a full season to work with, though, rather than just a handful of OAV episodes.)"

(The tree in my bedroom)

Hope everybody who celebrates it has a wonderful holiday! As usual, we did most of our celebrating yesterday. It was a great day, with lots of yummy food and good company! It was also the first Christmas that my nephew kinda got what was going on, which was fun, although he got bored after opening the first few presents and just wanted to play with all his new toys. *laughs* As for me, I got:

<lj-cut text=""Presents"">RCA Voyager Pro Tablet (Nothing fancy, but I&#39;ve been wanting a tablet for the past couple of years and the price was definitely right -- just $50 (with keyboard case) on Black Friday.)
A tiny diamond heart pendant
Awesome boots
A wall mirror in the shape of a treble clef
Some slippers
Lots of clothes (Unfortunately, half of them are the wrong size and Mom doesn&#39;t remember where she got them, so I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do about that... Maybe try to sale them on eBay?)
Money
$50 Visa gift card
Candy

And from my sister and her family, some Sailor Moon gifts!

<img alt="""" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/heavenly_pearl/8290510/20140/20140_original.png"" title="""" /> Not the best picture, but it&#39;s a gorgeous storage box with pics of all the senshi around it.

<img alt="""" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/heavenly_pearl/8290510/21658/21658_original.png"" title="""" />These are what they look like. Obviously, there are duplicates, which I plan to sell on eBay.

<img alt="""" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/heavenly_pearl/8290510/21823/21823_original.png"" title="""" /> And this, of course, is my favorite! I may end up keeping the two of them that came in the set: one to save and one to use.</lj-cut>

Christmas also means Right Stuf&#39;s annual Christmas sale. So far I&#39;ve bought:

<i>Ceres: Celestial Legend</i> DVD boxset
<i>Aria The Animation</i> DVD litebox
<i>Aria The Natural Part 1 &amp; 2</i> DVD litebox
<i>The Familiar of Zero</i> Seasons 2 &amp; 3
<i>Space Brothers</i> Collection 1, 2, 6

I also plan to order Season 4 of <i>The Familiar of Zero</i> and Collections 3 &amp; 4 of <i>Space Brothers</i>, but I think I&#39;m going to hold off on those until the very last day of the sale, just in case they put up a Mega Deal I might want. BTW, <i>Space Brothers</i> is amazing! I&#39;ve just streamed the first 26 episodes, but I fell in love with it almost right from the start, so when I saw the sets on sale, I decided to stop streaming and just buy it. (Unfortunately, I missed the Mega Deal on Collection 5, but I&#39;ll pick it up eventually.) &nbsp;"

(Would that make the Girls&#39; Memories Pluto in back Granny Pluto?)

I mentioned a couple of days ago that I had managed to get my hands on a rare gashapon Pluto from the early 2000s, but a surprise also came in the mail today: a Figuarts Pluto! The website I preordered her from said they didn&#39;t expect her to come in until February, so I was definitely pleased to get her so early. Haven&#39;t had much chance to play with her yet, but there&#39;s so much you can do with her! She has three extra faces, I think about nine or so extra hands (odd number, but whatever), and the Garnet Orb can be detached from the Time Staff to be held in one of those extra hands. Plus, she&#39;s fully posable -- even her hair can be posed. Granted, she&#39;s not in the most dynamic pose at the moment... I&#39;m not very good at posing her. Oh, well. Anyway, I love her. She may just take the title of &quot;Most Favorite Pluto Item&quot; from my Deluxe Adventure Doll."

I also managed to finally pick up a decently priced Petit Chara Tuxedo Mask, along with two rather rare vintage Pluto items: a <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/310952253618?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT"" target=""_blank"">UFO Capsule Mini Doll</a> and a <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/151915138261?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT"" target=""_blank"">gashapon figure</a> from the early 2000&#39;s. The gashapon figure was a particularly lucky find, since I originally had my eye on a brand new one for $50 but didn&#39;t want to pay that much for such a tiny figure. The one I bought isn&#39;t in perfect condition, but it&#39;s still looks rather nice, and $18 is definitely better than $50.

It&#39;s about time that somebody license-rescued <i>Fruits Basket</i>! It&#39;s way too good a series to be out-of-print. I already have the old Tokyopop volumes, so mainly I&#39;m just happy on other people&#39;s behalf, but I&#39;m also excited about the two other series that were licensed: <i>Liselotte and Witch&#39;s Forest</i> and <i>Twinkle Stars</i>. I&#39;m a little concerned about <i>Liselotte</i>, since its been on hiatus for going on three years due to Ms. Takaya&#39;s health, but <i>Twinkle Stars</i> is complete, which is great. I wonder if that <i>Fruits Basket</i> sequel that was announced a couple of months ago will end up being licensed as well. I haven&#39;t really heard anything since it was announced. Still don&#39;t know what it is supposed to be about..."

Remember when I bought my beloved Pluto doll on eBay a few weeks ago and mentioned that all I needed was to find a decently priced Neptune to complete my Sailor Senshi doll collection? (Well, and Saturn, but she&#39;s REALLY rare -- I didn&#39;t even know a North American one existed until I saw one for sale a couple of weeks ago.) Well, I found one, with bonus Serena/Usagi and Chibi/Minimoon! Can you believe I got all three dolls for $50? Yeah, the boxes are in crappy condition, and I have no real use for the two other dolls -- I&#39;ve already put them up <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/151903073184?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649"" target=""_blank"">for sale</a> again, so maybe I&#39;ll make some of that money back -- but I&#39;m almost as happy to have the Neptune doll as I was Pluto.

And since the box was in such bad condition, I had no hesitation in taking her out. Uranus was very happy about that! They&#39;ve decided to join my Pluto collection for now... Maybe it&#39;ll become an Outers collection instead.

<img alt="""" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/heavenly_pearl/8290510/19189/19189_original.png"" title="""" />

Poor Pluto, though... She&#39;s still stuck in her box. I just can&#39;t make up my mind whether to take her out or not!

I also want to point out the middle plushie, also a pretty lucky find. I don&#39;t think the person selling it knew what he had, since he listed her as Sailor Mercury, but she&#39;s an Irwin plushie from 2000 and apparently quite rare since she&#39;s the only one I&#39;ve ever seen for sale. (Though I knew they had done Inner plushies, I didn&#39;t even know Irwin had made a Sailor Pluto plushie.) I got her for only $16, which I thought was a pretty good deal! BTW, the plushie to the left of her is the Bandai (Japanese) one I mentioned before and the one on the right is the one put out from Great Entertainment. I&#39;ve also got my eye on another vintage <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/Sailor-Moon-Super-S-vintage-Plush-Doll-Sailor-Pluto-Banpresto-RARE-doll-/161903417899?hash=item25b2321a2b:g:ndYAAOSwnH1WXNVR"" target=""_blank"">Pluto plushie</a> but she&#39;s a bit on the expensive side ($30) and doesn&#39;t have the right color fuku, so I don&#39;t know. (One of the major annoyances of being a Pluto collector is that there&#39;s a lot of official merchandise out there that uses the wrong colors for her for some reason. I guess they didn&#39;t think black was marketable enough? On the plus side, it does make me less tempted to buy those items, saving me some money.)"

"event","I finished watching the newest Sailor Moon musical last night. I felt like it got off to a bit of a rocky start to be honest, but once Kaolinite and Dr. Tomoe took the stage, everything was fabulous. <i>Petite Etrangere</i> is still my favorite so far, though.

<lj-cut text=""Thoughts and spoilers behind the cut"">The Bad

- I wasn&#39;t feeling Haruka as a pop idol at all. Yeah, in the manga, she does sometime play piano as accompaniment to Michiru&#39;s violin playing, so it&#39;s not as if she has no interest in music at all, but still, the musical didn&#39;t even mention her true canonical passion: racing cars. Taking that away from her really feels like a major rewrite to her character. I also felt the change took away from Michiru as well, since she&#39;s the one who actually is passionate about music. That&#39;s her thing, so why give it to Haruka? I don&#39;t understand. It wouldn&#39;t have changed much at all for Michiru to be the one giving the concert (either singing or playing the violin). Or they could have at least made them a pop duo.

- Continuing along the same lines, Michiru didn&#39;t really get to do much at all. She was mostly just...there most of the time. Not only did they shaft her by giving the concert scene to Haruka, they also took out her flirtation with Mamoru despite keeping Haruka&#39;s flirtation with Usagi. Honestly, you could have taken her out of the show altogether and it probably wouldn&#39;t change much, which is disappointing to a Michiru fan like me. 

- The &quot;tryout&quot; scene for Infinity Academy was kinda cringe-worthy, especially since it felt like they were trying to fit in as much over-the-top humor as they could in one scene in order to make up for the fact that the rest of the show is really serious.

- Not enough Pluto. :P Though her actress says she played Pluto and Setsuna during the &quot;thank you&quot; portion at the end of the show, she actually didn&#39;t play Setsuna at all, since she&#39;s never showed detransformed during the show and I don&#39;t remember the name Setsuna even being mentioned. That disappointed me a little.

- I hated Mistress 9&#39;s dress. It might have been okay without the lace sleeves, but I think the major problem with it was that Hotaru&#39;s actress also played Mistress 9. I&#39;m not sure how old she is in real-life, but as Hotaru, she looked believable as the pre-teen she&#39;s supposed to be. Mistress 9, however, is supposed to be Hotaru&#39;s adult form, so the actress looked more like a little kid playing dress up in that costume. Black Lady was played by an adult actress in <i>Petite Etrangere</i>, so I wonder why they didn&#39;t do the same with Mistress 9. (I do think the actress did a fantastic job as Hotaru/Saturn/Mistress 9 acting wise, though!)

- There weren&#39;t very many stand-out songs. My favorite by far was &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot;, which was incredible, and Hotaru and Chibi-usa&#39;s duet was great as well, but I think this musical had the weakest score of the three new musicals.

The Good

- There were some pretty neat special effects during the show.

- Kaolinite and Dr. Tomoe &nbsp;-- they were so, so, good! Pretty much stole every scene they appeared in. I particularly loved the flashback scene. The &quot;experiment&quot; part actually gave me chills.

- Also enjoyed Hotaru&#39;s piano playing. Unlike Haruka-the-pop-idol, I find it very believable that a rich girl like Hotaru would take piano lessons. (And it looked like her actress was playing for real, which is awesome.)

- Mimette was kinda adorable!

- I loved that they made a reference to the anime by having Minako pretend to be Sailor Moon, and they made it even better by having Chibiusa take her place as Venus!

- The labyrinth scene, where the Witches 5 try to convince the senshi to stop fight, was amazing and so well done.

- I like that at several points in the show, they emphasized the connection between Mars, Neptune, and Kaolinite as characters with precognitive abilities.

- I LOVED pretty much the entire second act. I can&#39;t think of one thing wrong with it, other than Mistress 9&#39;s hideous dress. (And Super Sailor Moon&#39;s new fuku isn&#39;t that great, either.) Might have been nice to show Hotaru giving Chibiusa back her crystal, but that&#39;s pretty much the only thing I would have changed. Other than that, pefection. Especially loved the battle with Pharoah 90.</lj-cut>"

In happier news, I finally sold off all my extra Petit Chara figures. Whoo! Now just need to find a Sailor Jupiter and Tuxedo Mask to complete my collection. Those really do seem to be the rare ones. (Well, there is one Jupiter currently for sale, but I don&#39;t want to pay $15 for her if I don&#39;t absolutely have to. Edit: Went ahead and bought her anyway. With a combined shipping discount and a buy-3-items-get-$3.00-off deal from the seller, the price was more along the lines I was willing to pay. And I got two more items for my Pluto collection!) Might have to resort to buying some more blind boxes and hoping for a lucky find. BTW, whoever came up with the concept of blind boxes is EVIL. True, an absolute genius, but still evil.

I still have a bunch of other things for sale, too, which you can find <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/sch/heavenlydreampearl"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. Of particular note for Sailor Moon fans are the animated musical Luna that came out in the 90s (still works!) and a bunch of cards that were sold from vending machines at Toys R Us back in the day as well. There are also a bunch of DVDs that I&#39;m selling on behalf of my mother. She&#39;s a huge horror buff, so there&#39;s tons of scary movie on there (including a whole boxful I haven&#39;t even listed yet). Probably too late to buy any and get them in time for Halloween, but still might be worth a look if you like that sort of stuff.&nbsp;"

I didn&#39;t realize it was <i>that</i> long. <i>Everyone&#39;s Getting Married</i> also looks rather promising, being another josei title they&#39;ll be printing under the Shojo Beat banner. More josei is always welcome!

The summer anime season has (mostly) ended, so here&#39;s some final thoughts on the shows I watched:

<div><b>My Love Story!!</b> - Yep, I think this is another series that earns a Masterpiece ranking. I loved pretty much every single second of it. I still think that Rinko could have gotten a <i>little</i> more development, but she was fleshed out enough in the second half to satisfy me. Plus, it&#39;s just a really, really, really cute show!</div><div>
<b>Snow White With The Red Hair</b> - For the past few seasons, there has usually been one really stand-out shoujo series (<i>Akatsuki no Yona</i>, <i>My Love Story!!</i>), and <i>Snow White With The Red Hair </i>is this season&#39;s. Shirayuki is a fantastic lead, and the romance between her and Prince Zen is really sweet and respectful. It also looks gorgeous as well. My one complaint is that there doesn&#39;t really seem much of an overreaching storyline so far, but that&#39;s okay. I&#39;m looking forward to the next season anyway.</div><div>
<b>Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers</b> - You know, when I first read a summary of this series, I thought the whole &quot;seventh Brave&quot; thing was just a hook to get people interested. I figured that the identity of the seventh Brave would be figured out around the half-way point of the show, then they would continue on to fight the Demon Lord, with the traitor sometimes getting in the way.</div><lj-spoiler><div>But actually, the ENTIRE show is devoted to the mystery of the seventh Brave and they never get the chance to fight the Demon Lord at all! (At least this season. It&#39;s based on a series of light novels and ends in way that pretty much demands a continuation.)</div></lj-spoiler><div>I was kinda annoyed by that, actually, since the mystery just seemed to drag on and on and on to the point that by the end I didn&#39;t really care who the traitor was anymore.</div><div>
<b>Heroic Legend of Arslan</b> - A fairly average war story anime. I enjoyed watching it -- and I&#39;ll definitely be back for the upcoming new season that was just announced -- but there&#39;s nothing really memorable about it, except for the ending song &quot;One Light&quot;, which is absolutely gorgeous.</div><div>
<b>To-Love-Ru Darkness</b> - Lots and lots of fanservice, skirting the line of outright porn. What else is there really to say about it? (But it was still pretty fun to watch, if only to see how far they could push things.)</div><div>
<b>Hetalia: The World Twinkle</b> - Again, not much to mention. If you enjoyed the other seasons of anthropomophized countries being cute together, then you&#39;ll enjoy this season.</div><div>As for what I plan to watch in the new season... Well, there&#39;s a new season of <i>Diabolik Lovers</i> for some reason. I don&#39;t really WANT to watch it, but my sense of completeness will probably make me anyway. (I can at least hope the lead heroine might have grown a bit of a backbone...but she probably hasn&#39;t. Or maybe they&#39;ll add a nice, non-murderous romantic interest for her? ... Probably not.) At least a vampire anime is suitably Halloween-y, which I enjoy in October.</div><div>
Other than that, I&#39;d like to check out <i>Beautiful Bones - Sakurako&#39;s Investigation -</i>, <i>The Perfect Insider</i>, and <i>Dance with Devils</i> (an anime musical!) -- all also suitably Halloween-y. One-Punch Man isn&#39;t Halloween-y at all but seems to be getting a lot of early buzz, so I might check it out. <i>Starmyu</i> also kinda interests me, being about a bunch of hot guys trying to become an idol group, but <i>Dance with Devils</i> seems the more interesting &quot;singing bishies&quot; show, so I may skip it during simulcast and wait to watch it some other time. And I actually would like to watch the second season of <i>Noragami</i>, but I haven&#39;t watched the first season yet and for some reason Hulu has all of the dub episodes yet only two of the subtitled episodes. (Usually it&#39;s the other way around!) I&#39;d really prefer to watch the subtitled version first, so I&#39;m not sure what to do about that.</div>"

She&#39;s here! My very own Sailor Pluto Deluxe Adventure Doll! *dances* Petit Chara Pluto and action figure Pluto were very happy to have her join them. And they&#39;ll be getting another new friend in a few days: a <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/161631285503?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT"" target=""_blank"">Bandai Mini Stuffed Plush Sailor Pluto</a> (which is so much cuter than the American version put out by GE, although I&#39;ll probably get her eventually, too.) I got a great deal on it -- $9.79 with free shipping. The seller actually still has some more in stock, so if you&#39;re interested, you should check out the link. The sale is ending in about seven hours, though, so act quickly!

Now I have to decide whether or not to keep my pretty Pluto doll in the box... I have no intention of ever selling her, but if a situation came up when I NEEDED to sell her, it sure would be nice to have her still in the box so I could ask for top dollar for her. Plus, she&#39;s definitely the most valuable piece of Sailor Moon merchandise I currently own. (I kinda have to laugh at the original price tag that&#39;s still on the box. Marked down to $4.99! Man, I WISH I had come across a deal like that.) I&#39;m leaving her there for now -- might at least open the box to put her fallen henshin wand back in its slot -- but I may take her out later."

I mentioned in the last entry that I had a $25 coupon from eBay that I was thinking about using to buy a Girls Memories Sailor Pluto figurine. Well, I did another Sailor Pluto search this morning and found something even better: a <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/201438826664?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT"" target=""_blank"">Sailor Pluto Deluxe Adventure Doll</a>! I remember really wanting her when they first came out, but I never managed to come across one. (I do have the Sailor Uranus, though, and still kick myself that I didn&#39;t get Neptune when I had the chance.) At $70, I thought it was a pretty reasonable price for a presumably rare doll that had never been taken out of the box, but the $10 shipping charge was a bit much for my taste, so I decided to try my luck and offered to pay $50. I assumed that price would probably be denied, and it was, but the seller surprised me by counteroffering $55, which I just couldn&#39;t pass up. Sold, and with my coupon, I only had to pay $40 (shipping included)!

I finally have a Sailor Pluto doll! (Of course, now I need Neptune... Oh, well, maybe I&#39;ll luck out again someday.)"

Yes, please! No mention of the Dream arc -- looks like this third season is just going to focus on Infinity -- but at least hope is still alive for the future. Plus, Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn! I can&#39;t wait to see what their character designs look like. (And can Saturn finally get a transformation sequence? Please? Well, she doesn&#39;t really &quot;transform&quot; in the traditional sense during this arc, so maybe not this season, but if they do ever get to Dream -- Saturn sequence needs to happen.)

I sold two of my Petit Chara figures and managed to win the other Mini Dressable Sailor Venus auction I mentioned in my last post (although I did lose the Chibi Moon one, which I can live without).

"event","Ugh, I&#39;m feeling so frustrated at the moment! Just lost three auctions in a row, each more heartbreaking than the last.

First was the Japanese version of the Sailor Venus figurine that came with snap-on civilian clothes from the 90s. It was pretty much identical to the North American version -- just different packaging -- and I&#39;ve been trying to get my hands on her FOREVER since I already have all the other Inners plus Tuxedo Mask. And the bidding started out ridiculously cheap, too. Unfortunately, the auction ended while I was baby-sitting at my sister&#39;s house and somebody managed to bid over the maximum bid I had set up. I&#39;m not too upset about that, though, because I found another seller who is auctioning off the North American version at a pretty reasonable price which nobody else seems to be interested in at the moment, so fingers crossed!

Next loss was the Petit Chara Tuxedo Kamen. I was SO determined to win him and made certain to be at my computer so I could bid on him right to the last minute...but somebody else bid on him only <i>seconds</i> before the auction ended, giving me no time to put in another bid. Grr! There&#39;s another up for sale that I&#39;ve been watching, but I still don&#39;t want to pay $20 for him, so I guess I will just have to be patient and wait for another one to come up for sell.

Then this morning... *sigh* This one was the most terrible loss of all. It was a lot with three Banpresto Girls Memories figurines, Sailor Moon, Mars, and Venus. Again, the bidding started out REALLY cheap, and there was a bit of a bidding war over them. After the previous two losses, I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY wanted to win it, so again I was prepared to bid at the last second...only for the #!%#$^%! Internet to crap out on me at the exact moment I was trying to bid. *throws things around and yells alot* And unlike the other two, there&#39;s little chance something like that will come up again. I&#39;m trying to tell myself that I only really wanted them due to what a great deal it was, and that I didn&#39;t really NEED them, and that even if I did win them, I wouldn&#39;t be happy unless I collected all the other senshi, which would probably cost a lot of money...but it&#39;s not helping much.

And to top things off, I still haven&#39;t sold any of <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/usr/heavenlydreampearl"" target=""_blank"">my own items</a>... I&#39;ve lowered the prices again on the Petit Chara figurines, so maybe that&#39;ll help, but I&#39;m getting less and less optimistic, especially since there are already so many Moons and Mercurys for sale. (EDIT: I finally sold one! *dances* Had to take my bare minimum price, but, eh, whatever. I&#39;m just glad to get some of my money back. And maybe people will be more willing to buy from me now that I have made a sale.)"

I had to make some changes from the drawings due to the options of the maker, but I think they turned out pretty well, if I do say so myself.

Next we have the character who I took the name Yumeko from: Princess Dreama Aurora (nicknamed Yumeko), daughter of Chibiusa and Helios in <a href=""https://www.fanfiction.net/s/795166/1/Star-Crossed-Lovers"" target=""_blank"">Star-Crossed Lovers</a>. On the left is her senshi form; on the right is what she looks like when she becomes Golden Dream, the new priestess of Elysion.

And last, also from Star-Crossed Lovers, we have Yumeko&#39;s love interest, Shadow/Prince Apollo of Delos, and the three forms of his sister, Circe. The form on the left is Sailor Delos. (She&#39;s actually supposed to have a top hat instead of that Nehelenia headpiece, but the maker doesn&#39;t have a top hat (not even for guys), so I had to make due.) The one in the middle is her evil alter-ego Midnight, and the one on the right is her princess form.</lj-cut>"

(And some actual shopping -- picked up the Venus figure from the same set at a fairly decent price and currently debating the Tuxedo Kamen figure, which is more than I ideally want to spend, but it seems like he&#39;s the rarest so I should probably get it while I can.) Oh, man, I want EVERYTHING! I keep reminding myself that Christmas is coming up and I need to save my money to buy gifts (and possibly get some things from Right Stuf&#39;s annual holiday sale), but it&#39;s so hard! Just look at some of this stuff:

<lj-cut text=""WANT!"">
<img alt="""" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/heavenly_pearl/8290510/13408/13408_original.jpg"" title="""" /> A bag with Nehelenia and the Amazoness Quartet! If I didn&#39;t already have an identically shaped bag with Pegasus on it that I got for my last birthday, I would so be picking this up. I don&#39;t need another hobo bag, especially when I don&#39;t use the one I already have...but it&#39;s FREAKIN&#39; Queen Nehelenia. *whimpers* I want... (That reminds me, it would be amazing if Megahouse put out a set of Dead Moon Petit Charas (plus Helios, of course). They&#39;ve put out a Black Moon set, so it&#39;s not like villains are totally out of the question. I would be willing to import a set like that.)

It&#39;s possible that my sister may be giving this to me as a birthday or Christmas gift, so I&#39;m not buying it right now, but I probably will get it eventually, one way or another.

My guess is that they came with the single DVDs, but since I just have the boxsets, I don&#39;t have them...and I NEED them. They&#39;re really cheap, too -- it costs more to ship them than to buy them -- so it&#39;s likely I&#39;ll get them. (Edit: Just bought them! And got them for even cheaper, since the seller was nice enough to accept my $2 offer. If the shipping wasn&#39;t as high, I would have gladly paid their original price. Seriously, though, you could send those in an envelope for a lot cheaper...)

Oh, dang it, why did I go looking at cels? Now I really want this one... No, I&#39;m not going to get it. Cels are too expensive a hobby to get into, and it&#39;s hard to tell if they&#39;re even legitimate (although this one looks pretty legit to me).

</lj-cut>

Plus, a lot of other stuff! Man, I need to win the lottery or something.

In other news, Shirobako is AMAZING! Even though it was from the Fall 2014 season, which was the season that I watched a hundred shows, it somehow managed to completely slip pass my notice. I guess because at first glance it looked like one of those &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot; type of shows, which I actually do tend to like on occasion, but like I said, I was already watching a hundred shows at the time. (Okay, more like maybe fifteen?) Anyway, it&#39;s actually not that type of show at all (although the five central girls are pretty cute). Instead, it&#39;s a semi-realistic look at everything that goes into making anime, and it&#39;s absolutely fantastic. It <i>really </i>made me appreciate just how much work goes into creating the shows I love, while also being quite funny and entertaining. In fact, I loved it so much that it&#39;s joining <i>Kaleido Star</i>, <i>Death Note</i>, <i>Fruits Basket</i>, <i>Super GALS</i>, and <i>Ginban Kaleidoscope</i> on my &quot;Masterpiece&quot; list. A definite &quot;must see&quot; if you&#39;re an anime fan!"

"event","First off, a reminder that those <a href=""http://heavenly-pearl.livejournal.com/296318.html"" target=""_blank"">Petit Chara Sailor Moon and Mercury</a> figures are still available for sale, although if I don&#39;t get any takers here by the end of the month, I&#39;m thinking about putting them up for sale on eBay. I should also point out that the two extra Moons I have for sale are actually slightly different than the put-together one that I&#39;m keeping in that the ones for sale have both their eyes opened (like the pic on the box). Same for Mercury: one is the same as the put-together one I&#39;m keeping, but the other has both her eyes closed, with blush stickers on her cheeks.

Now, onto this 30 Day Anime Challenge I found on Tumblr, which is a little different than the one I did previous. Gonna do it all at once, though, just &#39;cause.

<lj-cut text=""Meme!""><b>Day 1 - Very First Anime You Watched</b>

Technically, <i>Hans Christian Andersen&#39;s The Little Mermaid</i> (just preordered the DVD release a few days ago!), but I didn&#39;t know it was anime at the time. The first anime I watched knowing it was anime was <i>Sailor Moon</i>.

<b>Day 2 - Favorite Anime You&#39;ve Watched So Far</b>

<i>Kaleido Star</i>!

<b>Day 3 - Favorite Male Anime Character Ever</b>

Helios from <i>Sailor Moon</i> (although I&#39;m more fond of his manga version).

<b>Day 4 - Favorite Female Anime Character Ever</b>

This is a tough one. I&#39;d say it&#39;s a close tie between Sora from <i>Kaleido Star</i> and Ran from <i>SuperGALS</i>.

<b>Day 5 - Anime You&#39;re Ashamed You Enjoyed</b>

There was a similar question on the last 30 Day meme I did, but I couldn&#39;t think of any. This time I do have an answer: <i>To-Love-Ru Darkness</i>. It&#39;s just really fun to see just how far they can push things without crossing the line into outright pornography. (And, believe me, they push it <i>really</i> far.)

<b>Day 6 - Anime You Want To See, But Haven&#39;t</b>

Oh, tons! But if I can only pick one I&#39;m most excited to watch, then it&#39;s probably <i>Space Brothers</i>.

<b>Day 7 - Your Anime Crush</b>

Helios (<i>Sailor Moon</i>), Yuri and Ken (both from <i>Kaleido Star</i>), Shigure and Hatori (both from <i>Fruits Basket</i>), Touya (<i>Card Captor Sakura</i>), Kyoya (<i>Ouran High School Host Club</i>), Yasu (for his personality) and Takumi (for his looks) (both from <i>NANA</i>), Makoto (<i>Free</i>!)...

<b>Day 8 - Favorite Anime Couple</b>

Helios/Chibiusa from <i>Sailor Moon </i>

<b>Day 9 - Best Anime Villain</b>

Light from <i>Death Note</i> (Villain protagonists count, right?)

<b>Day 10 - Favorite Fighter Anime</b>

Depends on what is meant by the term &quot;fighter anime&quot;, but the first one that came to mind when I read the question was <i>Yu Yu Hakusho</i>.

<b>Day 11 - Favorite Mecha Anime</b>

Tie between <i>Evangelion</i> and <i>Rah-Xephon</i>, although <i>Gurren Lagann</i> is no slouch either.

<b>Day 12 - Saddest Anime Scene</b>

Oh, so hard to choose... Maybe<lj-spoiler>Nuriko&#39;s</lj-spoiler>death scene in <i>Fushigi Yug</i>i? Or<lj-spoiler>Maes Hughes&#39;s funeral</lj-spoiler>in <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>? Or several scenes in <i>Clannad</i>?

<b>Day 13 - Anime Character You Are Most Similar To</b>

Sawako from <i>Kimi Ni Todoke</i> (which I&#39;m in the middle of watching right now)

<b>Day 14 - Anime That Never Gets Old No Matter How Many Times You&#39;ve Watched It</b>

<i>Kaleido Star, Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura</i>

<b>Day 15 - Favorite Animal Sidekick, Pet, Or Summoning From Any Anime</b>

Pegasus from <i>Sailor Moon</i> and Kero from <i>Card Captor Sakura </i>

<b>Day 16 - Anime With The Best Animation</b>

Well, almost anything from Kyoto Animation: <i>The Melancholy of</i> <i>Haruhi Suzumiya</i>, <i>Free!</i>, <i>Sound! Euphonium</i>, <i>Amagi Brilliant Park</i>, etc. <i>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade</i> Works was also pretty gorgeous.

<b>Day 17 - Favorite Supporting Male Character</b>

Excluding Helios, which I already picked for favorite male character, I&#39;d have to say Yuri from <i>Kaleido Star</i>. Or maybe Shigure from <i>Fruits Basket</i>? Well, actually, let&#39;s just say every character mentioned on Day 7.

<b>Day 18 - Favorite Supporting Female Character</b>

Another hard one... Layla from <i>Kaleido Star</i> would probably be my absolute favorite.

<b>Day 19 - Most Epic Scene Ever</b>

Instrumentality from the <i>End of Evangelion</i> movie.

<b>Day 20 - Anime Character That Gets On Your Nerves</b>

I&#39;m watching <i>Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers</i> this season, and let&#39;s just say I would not be disappointed if Chamot ended up being the seventh and everybody killed her...

<b>Day 21 - Favorite Goofy Anime Character</b>

Tamaki from <i>Ouran High School Host Club</i>

<b>Day 22 - Favorite Weapon, Gear, Or Armor Used In An Anime</b>

The Death Note from <i>Death Note</i>.

<b>Day 23 - Favorite Attack Used In An Anime</b>

I forgot what it is called, but the final attack used in the <i>Sailor Moon S</i> movie, the one where all the senshi are positioned in a circle around Sailor Moon.

<b>Day 24 - Moment That Shocked You The Most In Any Anime</b>

I&#39;m too spoiler-happy to be surprised very much, but<lj-spoiler>Nephrite/Neflyte&#39;s death</lj-spoiler>the first time I watched <i>Sailor Moon</i> was definitely a shock.

<b>Day 25 - Saddest Anime Death</b>

See Day 12.

<b>Day 26 - Best Anime Fight</b>

<i>Fate/stay night: UBW </i>had a couple of really good ones in the first half.

<b>Day 27 - Most Badass Scene From Any Anime Character</b>

Maka Albarn from <i>Soul Eater</i> punching out Asura.

<b>Day 28 - Favorite Quote From Any Anime Character</b>

I forget the exact wording -- I have it written down somewhere, but can&#39;t find it at the moment -- but at the very end of <i>Kaleido Star</i>, Layla says something along the lines of &quot;You&#39;re no longer my dream, Sora. Now you&#39;re my pride,&quot; and I seriously tear up every time I remember it. I&#39;m blinking back tears right now!

<b>Day 29 - An Anime You Wished Was Real</b>

<i>Kimi ni Todoke</i>. It&#39;s just so...nice.

<b>Day 30 - An Anime You Wished Never Ended and Continued On</b>

Sailor Moon, maybe? I at least wanted to see Chibiusa all grown up with her own team of senshi and being romantic with Helios!

"event","Remember a few months back when my sister gave me a set of Petit Chara figurines of the Outers/Moon/Chibimoon? Well, today at Books-a-Million, they had a set of six Inner figurines for sale. Of course I had to snatch those up to complete my set, but it turns out that out of the six I bought, three were Sailor Moon and three were Sailor Mercury. (You can&#39;t tell what you&#39;re getting until you open the box, which sucks.) Obviously, I don&#39;t need three copies of the same figurine, so I&#39;m offering the four extra ones for sale. (Two Moons and Two Mercurys -- luckily, this was a different Sailor Moon than the one I already had.) I paid about ten dollars each for them when you include tax, so that&#39;s what I&#39;ll sell them for, and I&#39;ll even take care of shipping. (Only in the U.S. though. Sorry, no international offers.) If you&#39;re awesome enough to want to take all four off them my hands -- maybe you know somebody to gift the other pair to -- I&#39;ll give you one of the figurines for free! So, four for $30, but the offer will only stand as long as I still have all four of them. First come, first served!

I&#39;d prefer payments through Paypal, but if you&#39;re on my Friends list, I&#39;m also open to receiving payments through the mail (check or cash). If you&#39;re interested, either PM me or comment to this entry with your email address. (Comments are screened.)

The boxes are open, of course, but all the parts are still in plastic.

O.o That was the very first anime I ever saw! I even still have the VHS tape of it, which was actually the first movie we bought when we got our first VCR way back in the late 80&#39;s/early 90&#39;s (can&#39;t remember the exact year, although 1989 sounds about right). Wow, that&#39;s one license rescue I never would have expected in a million years! It looks like this new release also comes with the original Japanese audio, too, which would be pretty cool to watch since I&#39;m sure the dub version I have is censored/rewritten like most anime dubs were back then. It&#39;s not too expensive -- just $16 at RightStuf -- so I may just double-dip for once."

"event","Found this fun manga meme at a review blog I like to read, so I&#39;d thought I&#39;d bring it over here.

<div><b>1. What was your first manga?</b> Sailor Moon</div><div>
<b>2. What is your most expensive manga?</b> Assuming that we&#39;re talking about individual books and not boxsets, then probably the <i>Azumanga Daioh</i> omnibus (from Yen Press). The retail price was $24.99 according to the cover, although I know I didn&#39;t pay that much. Still, I imagine I still paid around the $15-20 range for it.</div><div>
<b>3. What was your least expensive manga?</b> The manga I got for free as gifts, obviously! But sticking to manga I paid for myself... Well, I actually bought the two volumes of <i>The</i> <i>Flower of the Deep Sleep</i> off the Amazon Marketplace for only a cent each, but I still had to pay shipping on them, so they ended up being $4 each. Still a pretty good deal, though not amazing. Hmm, I vaguely recall paying a dollar (or maybe $2?) for a manga on clearance at Half-Price Books, but I&#39;m not sure which one it was... <i>Call Me Princess</i>, maybe? Yeah, I think that was the one. It&#39;s something I probably would have never picked up unless it was that cheap. (Just checked the price tag that&#39;s still on it -- $2.49, but I still don&#39;t think I paid that much for it.)</div><div>
<b>4. What is the most boring manga you own?</b> <i>Miyuki-chan in Wonderland</i> -- pure fanservice, and not even that sexy. Still, it was CLAMP, so...</div><div>
<b>5. What is your favorite manga series?</b> <i>Fruits Basket</i>! Although if <i>NANA</i> was ever completed, it might knock FB from the top spot.</div><div>
<b>6. What is the most relatable manga series you own?</b> <i>Kimi ni Todoke</i>, definitely. I identify with Sawako like &quot;woah&quot;!</div><div>
<b>7. What is one manga you own that is based off an anime?</b> As in the anime came first? Umm... I don&#39;t think I have any. I guess the closest would be <i>Story of Saiunkoku</i>, since the anime and manga were both based off the original light novels. (And I&#39;m pretty sure the anime came before the manga.)</div><div>
<b>8. What is your rarest manga?</b> Well, I don&#39;t know about rare in the general sense, but one of the most difficult volumes for me to find was <i>Name of the Flower</i>, Vol. 1, since I had the misfortune to order it right before CMX went out of business. I searched for around eight months for a decently priced used copy. And I still don&#39;t own print copies of <i>Red River</i> Vols. 15-17, but I have digital copies, which is good enough. (If I found those print copies for really cheap, I&#39;d probably pick them up, but I&#39;m not going out of my way to search for them.)</div><div>
<b>9. What is the most reprinted manga you own?</b> I have no idea, really. I guess if you interpret the question to mean which had the most editions, then <i>Sailor Moon</i> might count: chapters in Mixxzine/Smile, Chix Comics editions (the single-chapter floppies), the Tokyopop graphic novels, and the new Kodansha graphic novels. (And I actually own most of those.)</div><div>
<b>10. What is the most popular manga you own?</b> I imagine it&#39;s either <i>Fruits Basket</i> or <i>Death Note</i>, depending on which demographic you&#39;re talking about.</div><div>
<b>11. What is the most damaged manga you own?</b> No question, the Tokyopop GNs of <i>Sailor Moon</i>. I&#39;ve got pages falling out of a few of those.</div><div>
<b>12. Which manga has the most amazing art?</b> I&#39;d say<i> A Bride&#39;s Story</i> has the most amazing art in a technical sense -- <i>Emma</i> from the same mangaka is really beautiful as well -- but my heart really lies with Yuu Watase&#39;s style. CLAMP is no slouch themselves, especially when Mokona&#39;s the lead artist, like in <i>Card Captor Sakura</i> and <i>Magic Knight Rayearth</i>.</div><div>
<b>13. What is the oldest published manga that you own?</b> Well, I know that <i>Sailor Moon</i> was the first manga I bought, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the oldest published, especially if going by when it first came out in Japan. Looking at the dates at MyAnimeList and Anime News Network, it looks like the oldest would be <i>Let&#39;s Stay Together Forever</i>, which came out in 1989. (Have no clue about American publishing dates.)</div><div>
<b>14. What is the newest published manga you own?</b> Looks like Vol. 3 of <i>Yukarism</i>. (This time, talking about what was released in the U.S.)</div><div>
<b>15. What are some of the most recent manga you have purchased?</b> The aforementioned <i>Yukarism </i>Vol. 3, <i>Meteor Prince</i> Vols. 1 &amp; 2, <i>Utsabora</i> omnibus, <i>Skip-Beat!</i> omnibus (with Vols. 31-33), <i>Arata: The Legend</i> Vols. 21 &amp; 22... Those are the ones that I remember off the top of my head.

I tag anybody who wants to do this!</div>"

(That&#39;s probably why they left out the whole &quot;Wiseman/Death Phantom physically merging with Nemesis&quot; thing from the first anime.)</lj-spoiler> Other than that, though, I really enjoyed the episode and still have my fingers crossed that a new season will be announced eventually. They certainly set things up for a continuation,<lj-spoiler> what with the granting of new powers and Chibi-Usa coming straight back. Of course, that&#39;s what happened in the manga chapter, but if they were for sure not going to continue, it would have been easy enough to rewrite things to leave those parts out.</lj-spoiler>

Plus, ANN is reporting that Toei plans to make some announcements about &quot;future developments&quot;, so I&#39;d say new season is looking very likely!"

Huh. Well, I absolutely love <i>Fruits Basket</i> -- the manga is my all-time favorite -- but I must confess I don&#39;t really get the point of a <i>Fruits Basket</i> sequel, especially with how it ended.<lj-spoiler>(The curse on the Sohma family was broken, and it was strongly implied that it would never come back.)</lj-spoiler> The article even says that none of the original characters will show up in the story -- it's focused on a new girl who attends Tohru's high school after she graduates -- so...yeah. It's a weird decision. If the mangaka wanted to do more <i>FB</i> manga, I think a collection of side stories would have worked better. There are a lot of things I wished I knew more about, like the Mabudachi Trio's high school days, Hatori and Mayu's relationship, Ayame and Mine's relationship, poor Ritsu who only showed up in a handful of chapters... 

But all of this just reminds me -- somebody needs to remake the <i>Fruits Basket</i> anime now that the original manga is over! Come on, they've done <i>Sailor Moon Crystal</i> and <i>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</i>, so why not <i>Fruits Basket</i>?"

"event","<div>Now that the summer anime season is over (for the most part; <i>The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan</i> has a weird amount of episodes and will cross over into next season, although it&#39;s still the same cour), I&#39;ll give my thoughts on the shows I watched.
</div><div><b>Continuing series </b></div><div>
<i>Sailor Moon Crystal</i> - Love, love, love the second half of the series! A definite improvement on the somewhat mishandled first half, which was helped by not making any huge changes to the manga plotline. I still think the new musical version of this arc is my favorite, but a lot better than the old anime, with the nonsensical and badly-handled break-up and stupid attempts at a MotD plot when that kind of plotline doesn&#39;t really work with the arc. Just one more episode left! (Got my fingers crossed that a new season will be officially announced soon. I need the Dream arc animated!)</div><div>
<i>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works</i> - I wish they hadn&#39;t taken a break between the first and second halves of this show. I absolutely loved the first half, but by the time the second half started airing, I had forgotten a lot of what happened, so there were some definite moments of confusion on my part. (I get the feeling that it would have been helpful to be more familiar with the original VN during this part as well.) For the first time, I understand why sometimes there&#39;s a need for recap episodes. I would have benefitted from one at the start of this season! I was also disappointed by some of the things that happened to Rin and Saber and how they reacted to those things, which seemed out of character to me. I still enjoyed the show, though, and think it&#39;s one of the most gorgeously animated shows I&#39;ve ever seen.</div><div>
<i>I Can&#39;t Understand What My Husband Is Saying</i> - More of the same, really. Nothing much else to say, although I actually really liked the final episode. That was my favorite of the entire series.</div><div>
<b>New Series</b></div><div>
<i>My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU TOO! </i>- Technically a continuing series, but since I watched both seasons back to back, I&#39;m counting it as a new one. Anyway, I LOVED the first season and thought it was hilarious, but the second season isn&#39;t quite as good, IMO. I mean, I still really liked it and all, but for most of this season the relationship between Hachimon, Yui, and Yukino was kind of strained, which put a damper on a lot of the humor I enjoyed from the first. Plus, the &quot;cases&quot; they work on aren&#39;t as fun and were way drawn out. Seriously, how many episodes did they spend on planning the Christmas event with those annoying people from the other school who just liked to talk and wouldn&#39;t make any actual decisions about anything? I just looked it up -- five. freakin&#39;. episodes. Three episodes too many, if you ask me. One episode to establish how annoying those people were and one episode for somebody to stand up and tell them to start taking things seriously...that&#39;s all that was needed. (Okay, so Hachimon and the others learned a lot of good lessons during this arc, too, but still...five. freakin&#39;. episodes.)</div><div>
<i>My love STORY!!</i> - If I had to sum up this series in one word, it would be...ADORABLE! Seriously, it is impossible to watch an episode of this show and not end up grinning like an idiot by the end. It&#39;s just so sweet and fluffy and heartwarming and...well, adorable! I do wish that Yamato (the main female character) was a more developed character -- you can basically describe her in three phrases: really nice, likes to bake, and finds Takeo very, very sexy -- but other than that, I have no real complaints. (And since the show is continuing into next season with a second cour, maybe Yamato will get more development later on.) My favorite of the season!</div><div>
<i>Sound! Euphonium </i>- This show makes me wish my sister and her husband were anime fans, because I think they would really like it, too. (They&#39;re both junior high/high school band directors.) I&#39;m no band geek -- I was a choir nerd instead -- but the music talk comes across as being mostly realistic, and the characters look like they&#39;re actually playing the instruments correctly. Being a Kyoto Animation show, there&#39;s no real need to point out that the animation is gorgeous, but...well, the animation is GORGEOUS. I also quite enjoyed the characters. It ended in a great spot, but I definitely wouldn&#39;t mind if we got a second season of this!</div><div>
<i>The Disappearance of Yuki Nagato</i> - This is an AU version of T<i>he Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</i>, based on the movie <i>The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya</i>. I liked the original MoHS well enough, but I think I actually like this version more. Granted, the plotlines are nothing special -- the first few episodes are just your typical Christmas/Valentine cliche fests -- but the characters are more likeable, especially Haruhi Suzumiya herself, who loses her more...sociopathic qualities (like molesting poor Mikuru all the time, although she does do some boob-groping during the hot springs episodes) while still remaining mostly true to her original character. Plus, it&#39;s really fun to pick up the allusions made to the original series.</div><div>
<i>Amagi Brilliant Park</i> - Technically, this was from a couple of seasons ago, but it never got picked up for legal simulcast for some reason. Crunchyroll finally got the rights this to it season, so I&#39;m counting it as part of the summer season. Anyway, love, love, love this show! The humor was great, and again, Kyoto Animation, so it looked fantastic. Sure, it would have been nice to get a new season of <i>Full Metal Panic</i> (by the same author), but I loved ABP just as much as FMP, so I&#39;m not complaining. (Okay, one complaint: When is CR going to get the rights to the 13th episode? From what I understand, it&#39;s not a necessary episode -- everything wrapped up nicely in Episode 12 -- but I still want to see it!)</div><div>
So it was a pretty successful summer anime season! (And I haven&#39;t even watched the <i>Heroic Age of Arslan</i> yet. Never got around to it, but it&#39;s on my list.)</div><div>
Not much has caught my eye next season, though. I definitely want to watch <i>Snow White of the Red Hair</i> (<i>Akagami no Shirayuki-hime</i>), and <i>Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers</i> might be worth a shot, but that&#39;s about it aside from new seasons of series I&#39;ve already watched before (<i>Hetalia</i> and <i>To-LOVE-Ru</i>). Oh, and I&#39;m kinda interested in Gangsta., but I&#39;m super on the fence. Might just wait until the end of the season and see what the general opinion is.</div>"

"event","Happy 4th of July to all the Americans reading this!

My sister and her family are coming over soon, so I&#39;m not going to say much about today&#39;s <i>Crystal</i> episode, only to say I LOVED pretty much every single minute of it. I actually didn&#39;t cry -- just got a little teary -- but that was probably because of the same thing that happened when I watched those dub episodes a couple of weeks ago. I think I was just anticipating it too much to just let myself truly feel all the emotions. It was <i>beautifully</i> done, though, and pretty much exactly what I wanted.

<lj-cut>I also really like that the other senshi got to combine their powers and help Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Kamen attack Death Phantom, which was a change from the manga. It makes up a little for the fact that they didn&#39;t get to do much this arc, since three/fourths of them were kidnapped most of the season. My one complaint is that I was hoping that <i>Crystal</i> would make it one hundred percent clear that Chibi-Usa&#39;s crystal is her <i>own</i> crystal and not Neo-Queen Serenity&#39;s. It&#39;s always been obvious to me, since in the manga Venus is holding NQS&#39;s crystal while Usagi and Chibi-Usa are transformed, but with Venus attacking this time, NQS&#39;s crystal seems to have disappeared.</lj-cut>"

Hmm, if the question was least favorite manga character, I would say Akito from <i>Fruits Basket</i>, but he didn&#39;t really appear in the anime enough for me to develop a strong hatred of him. So...can I just say pretty much the entire cast of <i>Diabolik Lovers</i>? Not a single likeable one in the bunch.</p><p style=""line-height: 21.2999992370605px; margin: 0px 0px 1.35em; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><b>5. list all anime you have ever watched </b>

I&#39;d say a combo of Ami/Sailor Mercury from <i>Sailor Moon</i>, Shigure from <i>Fruits Basket</i>, Nodaka from <i>Negima</i>, and Shinji from <i>Evangelion</i>. (And although I&#39;ve only read the manga and I haven&#39;t watched the anime yet (I plan to!), I&#39;ll add Sawako from <i>Kimi ni Todoke</i> to the list as well.

It feels weird calling him a sidekick, but Pegasus from <i>Sailor Moon</i>. Maybe Kero from <i>Card Captor Sakura</i> would be a better answer, since he&#39;s definitely a sidekick...</p><p style=""line-height: 21.2999992370605px; margin: 0px 0px 1.35em; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><b>11. anime you didn&rsquo;t expect to like but did</b>

Hmm, <i>Attack on Titan</i> was actually a lot better than I was expecting, so I guess I&#39;ll go with that.</p><p style=""line-height: 21.2999992370605px; margin: 0px 0px 1.35em; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><b>12. anime that should get more attention from others</b>

Man, that&#39;s too hard to answer...

<i>Kaleido Star, Sailor Moon, Card Captor Sakura,</i> and <i>Fruits Basket</i> immediately come to mind.

Well, I don&#39;t know about them being objectively the best, but my top ten list is: <i>Kaleido Star, Death Note, Fruits Basket, Super Gals, Ginban Kaleidoscope, Princess Nine, Card Captor Sakura, Sailor Moon, Fushigi Yugi</i> and <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i> (both series; don&#39;t make me choose between them).</p><p style=""line-height: 21.2999992370605px; margin: 0px 0px 1.35em; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><b>17. biggest anime crush</b>

I started watching <i>Sailor Moon</i> when I was probably around twelve or thirteen, I think. I wouldn&#39;t say anybody &quot;introduced&quot; me to it, but I did first come across it while my mother was flipping channels one morning. As for that <i>Little Mermaid</i> movie I mentioned before, I don&#39;t remember the age when I first saw it, but I do remember it was the very first tape my parents bought for me and my sister when we got our first VHS player. (And I actually still have that tape!) I want to say we bought it in maybe 1989? I would have been around five or six then.</p><p style=""line-height: 21.2999992370605px; margin: 0px 0px 1.35em; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><b>23. unpopular character you love</b>

<i>Princess Nine</i>. I used to have it rated a ten, but the ending has always really bugged me, so I dropped it down to a nine. With a better ending, it would definitely be a ten, though.</p><lj-spoiler>
<p style=""line-height: 21.2999992370605px; margin: 0px 0px 1.35em; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""></p>The reason I dislike the ending isn&#39;t because they lost -- although I certainly would have loved it if they had won -- but how they lost. If they had lost because the other team was legitimately better than them, that would be fine, but neither Ryo or Izumi played their best because they were distracted by their romantic woes concerning the other team&#39;s ace player. I hated that, because they probably would have won if Ryo and Izumi had focused solely on the game.

"event","Great episode today! I&#39;m half-dreading watching the next episode, though, because I have a feeling I&#39;m going to cry bucketloads of tears. Heck, I got a little teary-eyed just watching the <i>preview</i> for the next episode! But on the other hand, the same moment I&#39;m dreading is also my favorite moment of the manga, so... Yeah, conflicted.

<lj-spoiler>- King Endymion actually looked more translucent this episode, which was nice.

- Saffir&#39;s hands were different than what I was expecting. Not really a bad different...just different.

- It&#39;s humorous how emotional Mercury seemed to get when Black Lady hit Luna-P. I mean, it&#39;s just a toy!

- This was really one of the most action-packed episodes of <i>Crystal</i>, I think. Wished the Inners actually got a chance to attack instead of just shielding Sailor Moon, and those black moon...thingies were kind of weird, but I loved Sailor Moon showing how powerful she is. The scenes with her resonating with the Crystal Palace were beautiful, and I really liked the background music.

- The revelation of who (or more appropriately, what) Wiseman is was really well done. I also liked the appearance of Nemesis.

- Poor Pluto, wanting to join the fight but unable to lead her post. And Chibi Pluto during the flashback with Queen Serenity was just so adorable!

- Although not as cute as Diana! Seriously, Diana was always cute, but <i>Crystal</i> turns up her cuteness to almost epic levels. I especially loved Pluto nuzzling Diana in thanks for agreeing watch over the Time Gate. I&#39;m going to have to make an avatar of that moment someday...maybe even a wallpaper.

- Wow, Demande seemed very...unhinged when he grabbed Sailor Moon&#39;s crystal. (I did feel a little sorry for him when he had to kill Saffir, though.)</lj-spoiler>

This week, I also finally got around to watching the new dub for the second half of the first Classic season. (I&#39;ve had it since it came out, but I wanted to get through some of my backlog before watching it.) I gotta say, I LOVE Makoto&#39;s new voice actress, and Cherami Leigh was just as great as I expected as Minako. I didn&#39;t cry as much as I normally do during certain episodes -- actually didn&#39;t cry at all during Nephrite&#39;s death scene, which usually leaves me in a sobbing mess -- but I think that was either because I&#39;ve finally become desensitized after watching these episodes so much or that I was anticipating crying so much that I wasn&#39;t as engaged in actually watching, therefore I didn&#39;t let the emotions come naturally. I don&#39;t think it was the fault of the dub, which I still think is really well done, and certainly an improvement over the first one."

"event","Solid episode today. Don&#39;t have much to say about it, really, other than Black Lady was pretty awesome and I liked that Wiseman started using a more menacing voice. Oh, and Diana was just absolutely adorable!"

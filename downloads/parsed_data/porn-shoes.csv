"event","Just a few minutes ago our power came back since the hurricane.I've been dying in the grueling summer heat (yes, it is still summer kiddos!).I realize how much i love all of the things that takes power for us to use, the fridge, the phone, the air, the t.v, stereo, COMPUTER.Lol.Everyone is so exhausted, we have barely any good food left and everyone has been miserable in this heat!

"event","I hate being so exposed, having everything open for everyone to read and nothing of my own to posess and claim as my own.No one knows me, no one knows everything i hate and everything that i could never imagine living without, or what i'm thinking when i lay alone in my room.Every time we scream and we grow apart just as much as before and it's my fault that this happens, that i ruin everything.I never say the right things or use the right tone.I'm not pretty enough or polite enough, i'm not perfect.I hate being who i am because of you and i'm sick of this life."

"event","I had a huge PMS attack yesterday, sorry dear friends.Heh.I'm just alittle overly dramatic and emotional near this wonderful time of the month and fight with about everyone and anyone whom pisses me off.Well, yesterday evening i got to see my brother for the first time in awhile, i do miss him even though he's annoying as all get out, but missable.Lol.As for my lovely Mirranda, she got to flirt with her new companion all night, i was quite happy for her infact.She deserves a good guy, i hope Johnathan is.Now i'm freaking out about Homecoming, ugh.

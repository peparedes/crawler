[Samuel L. Jackson:] 
""That's it! 
I've had it with these motherfucking snakes 
on this motherfucking plane!"" 

Times are strange 
We got a free upgrade for 
snakes on a plane. 
Fuck em, I don't care. 
Bought the cheap champagne, 
we're going down in flames, hey. 

Oh, I'm ready for it 
Come on, bring it. 
Oh, I'm ready for it 
Come on, bring it. 
Oh, I'm ready for it 
Come on, bring it. 
Oh, I'm ready for it 
Come on, bring it. 

So kiss me goodbye. 
Honey, I'm gonna make it out alive. 
So kiss me goodbye. 
I can see the venom in their eyes. 
Goodbye. 

It's time to fly, 
to make the stars align 
with the turpentine 
lounging in their suits and ties. 
Watch the whore's parade 
for the price you paid, hey. 

Oh, I'm ready for it 
Come on, bring it. 
Oh, I'm ready for it 
Come on, bring it. 
Oh, I'm ready for it 
Come on, bring it. 
Oh, I'm ready for it 
Come on, bring it. 

So kiss me goodbye. 
Honey I'm gonna make it out alive 
So kiss me goodbye. 
I can see the venom in their eyes 

So kiss me goodbye. 
Honey, I'm gonna make it out alive 
So kiss me goodbye. 
I can see the venom in their eyes 
Goodbye. 

Ladies and gentlemen 
These snakes are slitherin' 
with dollar signs in they eyes 
with tongues so reptilian 
This industry's venemous 
with cold-blooded sentiment 
No need for nervousness 
It's just a little turbulence. 

So kiss me goodbye. 
Honey I'm gonna make it out alive 
So kiss me goodbye. 
I can see the venom in your eyes 

So kiss me goodbye. 
Honey, I'm gonna make it out alive 
So kiss me goodbye. 
I can see the venom in their eyes 
Goodbye. 

Oh, I'm ready for it 
Come on, bring it. 
Oh, I'm ready for it 
Come on, bring. 
Oh, I'm ready for it 
Come on, bring it. 
Oh, I'm ready for it 
Come on, bring it. 

We seem to be losing altitude 
at an alarming pace 
Midtown downtown 
Snakes on a blog 
I suggest you grab your ankles 
and kiss your ass goodbye."

It's a clip from BBC News 24, live in the studio after the verdict of the Apple versus Apple Corps court case was announced.

They supposedly have their digital music expert in to talk about the effects that the judgement will have to consumers. The only the thing is, he isn't the expert they were after. He's just a cabbie they found at reception. Somehow they managed to take him onto the set, mic him up and question him about his expert opinion without him questioning anything.

The look on his face is actually amazing.</lj-cut>"

Then went into Croydon with Nick, Becky, Jay, Charlotte and Simon, which was a good laugh. Nick ate a sub. Becky got her ear pierced. It looks dead cool.

In honour of our hairy friend's revival I bring you...

<lj-cut text=""KONG THROUGH THE YEARS (GRRRR...)"">

It started off in 1933:

<img src=""http://perso.wanadoo.fr/sanmartin/1930-1939/1933_-_Sortie_du_film_King_Kong.jpg"">
Note the youthful Kong - clear complection, no bags under the eyes and rather toned upper body.

Mr. Kong's second (proper) coming came in the mid '70s:

<img src=""http://www.nostalgia.com/posters/36022.JPG"">
Note how he still retains the youthful look, but seems to have let himself go a bit...

The big K also features in the '74s smash hit 'King Kong versus Godzilla':

<img src=""http://www.nostalgia.com/posters/19364.JPG"">
See how he seems to have made a new friend in the shape of what seems to be a hybrid of a t-rex meets the tin-man from The Wizard of Oz

Finally, the King of The Swingers returns to our screen this week:

<img src=""http://us.movies1.yimg.com/movies.yahoo.com/images/hv/photo/movie_pix/universal_pictures/king_kong/_group_photos/andy_serkis7.jpg"">
At over 70 years old, Kong is looking great for his age (scars around the eyes suggest he's had a little nip and tuck, but hey, who hasn't in Hollywood!). Looks like he can still pick up the ladies too. Literally.

"event","Thought I may as well update this, seeing as I have nothing to do. Well my sister's off to Sheffield Uni at the end of September which will be weird really, her leaving home and all that. However this does mean I will conveniently be able to arrange trips to go up and see her and also see a number of top Sheffield bands playing on their home turf (hopefully). 

Tent is in shipshape condition for next weekend, but i need to somehow make it standout amongst the billions of others, any ideas?

Results a week today... Oh well...

And to round of this brilliant post, I give you a picture of the world's ugliest dog (no, seriously, it won awards)

But I just thought you might like to know you can book your tickets for Art Brut at The Cartoon here ( http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/user/?region=uk&query=detail&event=134116&interface=glasswerk1 ) I've already got mine and have one spare ticket. I say everybody buy a ticket and we make the 6th of October Joe's Official birthday (The Queen has two, so why can't Joe)

Right I'm off now, I have a plane to catch!

Farewell."

Today was rather fun (picnic in Lloyd Park - party rings, oh yes), but also quite sad as it was Nick's last day in the country :( He is coming back for a few days in a couple of weeks time, so it's not all bad (and it sounds like anothher excuse for a party-shaped thing). Teh party on Saturday and then Tin Pan Alley festival on Sunday which should be good, but I'm running out of money which is not so good.

For all those myspace fanatics, have a gander at this - http://www.myspace.com/joesjacket You can listen to a few of our songs here, and just generally hurl abuse at us. Enjoy!"

'...im really sorry to tell you that the rumours we have split up are true. those of you close to us know that we have been sailing through choppy sea's for some time, putting on a brave face and running on the driven belief that we could weather the storm and come out the other side stronger for it. unfortunatley we have not found our clear blue skies. 
ultimately, i believe being in a band should be fun, it should affirm your life and change it for the better and none of us were happy with the situation. to get through tough times a band needs a shared aim, a common desire and charlie didnt share our ambitions. it couldnt work, it was an uphill struggle with no visible end. 
im afraid this is the best explanation i can offer, and if it seems inadaquate im sorry, but its breaking my heart writing this. 
all your kind words and support have not fallen on deaf ears, we value all of you and would like to say thankyou for everything, it has been our pleasure. we are sorry if you feel let down. 
we are in the process of deciding which forth comming gigs to play, if any, so keep checking the forum for information as Vincent will certainly be doing shows, as will alex. 
thankyou to all of you again, im just so sorry. MR NEILL V'

RIP Vincent Vincent and The Villains. <strike>Lets all go see one of their last dates:</strike>

<strike>SATURDAY JULY 2nd - BLOW UP, METRO, OXFORD STREET. Anyone wanna come?</strike> Date of Dominic's tramp party. Oh well, maybe see them another time..."

Maths is also rather depressing.

In partially better news Be Your Own Pet have been added to the Carling Stage on the Saturday at Reading which should be good."

"event","Today was rather fun actually - went up to London with Sam, Taki and Kimberley. We did, however, get on a train which decided to breakdown thirty seconds before reaching Victoria, which meant a 3 HOUR wait. On a cramped train. However, we managed to entertain (*cough*) those around us with beautiful renditions of some classic sing-a-longs on Sam's acoustic. We were also interviewed by some freelance journalist who was gonna send the finished article to the NME or something or other...

Then we went on to a park in Shoreditch and the pub and was all rather grand.

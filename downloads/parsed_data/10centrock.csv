I've buried my blood in costumes of red these last few weeks -- hidden the piece of me that craves the desperate hours of an early morning when I've spent the whole night staring at the swirls in my ceiling and hiding from the questions/demands/influence of the outside world. I have closeted my ability to love, smothered my addiction to brutal honesty, served up my soul on a silver platter -- and what have I to show for it?

I have a predilection for emotionally vacant girls because I can already plan the outcome -- those with no brains have not the faculties to process me, relationships will end by my hand or theirs -- assuredly. This is my weakness -- in this way, I feel as if I control my own future, as if I might even be able to predict it.

I'm tired.  I don't know what I'm doing.

And I want to call you to hear the rest of the story...sorry about the other night.

Hope your car is doing better.

I want to buy a scooter, but I think that food is more important at this point.

And Leona Naess concert tickets.

Hana asked me to call her by the name her family calls her.  Either I was fucking her name up really bad before, or that means she likes me (not 'get-into-her-pants like', like 'lets-be-good-friends like'), right?  One or the other.

And I have to tell you my humiliating story about the Palmers (a society--like a sorority).  Actually, I don't really care.  It's a little embarrassing, but whatev, yo.  I was with Robin yesterday, in rehearsal.  She told me that I was going to hell.  She also winked at me.

And I'm telling you, she was staring at me.  For me to notice this is a big thing, because I totally don't pick ANYTHING UP until way too late.

The problem is, it's not telling whether or not she was staring at me, it's WHY.  Maybe it's just to be rediculously sexual - because that's how she is.  I made this comparison to my friend courtney...

Hana:Robin::Mandy Moore:Angelina Jolie

in terms of image and such.

Hana's smart, but not crrazy genius smart.  She's got it together, though.  Very cute and such.  She's a dancer, and she's got a dancer's body...very nice.

Robin is sexual and smart and confident and you want to be friends with her if you can't have sex with her because you'd rather have her on your side than against you.

Last night, I talked to hana for a long time, she was taking apart my ""type"".  I get this a lot, since all the girls I like pretty much look exactly the same and have similar personality characteristics just tunneled differently.  Anyway, i htought it was ironic because she's TOTALLY MY TYPE and I don't know/don't think she gets it.

She keeps talking about how she'd be interested to see what it felt like to be in a relationship with a girl, but she's dating this boy and she's really into him.  We call him moron fucker face.  And by ""we"", i mean ""I"".  He's not nice to her!  He's a jerk.  Anyway, she's got it in her head that she needs to be in a serious relationship at this point, one that lines her up for marriage, so she won't dump him.

Robin is the kind of girl who CAN wink at someone and be really cool and smooth and such.  Gah.  Robin.

I'm gonna go drool all over my homework now.

""giving them to you gives me reason to stalk you.  But I've been doing that anyway"" ???

I figured she was just being friendly.  I dunno.  I'm bad with this kind of stuff.

And so anyway, she scares me because she's little and I was falling asleep and rambling about london or something and I think I might have told her way to much for her own good.

also.  she called herself my ""sugar mommy"" which made me laugh at the time, but now makes me scrunch up my eyebrows.

I'm tired.  this leads to me being too lazy to start my work.  this then leads me to posting ridiculous entries on livejournal about how I'm tired and stressed out because I've got too much work to do.

But really, I just kind of want to sit with someone and be quiet and have that be okay.  I'm tired of doing everything for everyone else.  I'm too involved on campus...right now, I'd rather just lay in bed with someone and listen to music or something.

My favorite thing to do with kate was just to lay together.  We'd talk about ridiculous things and it was nice.  Every night, we'd lay in our beds, in separate houses and talk for hours about nothing.  We'd read the ingredients in salsa to each other and the colors of dinosaurs, and that's when I fell in love with her.

But that's weird, who am I going to lay with here?  No one.  Or how would I even go about getting someone to lay with me?  I'm sad and lonely and I want to lay with someone.  I don't want to have sex with them -- though that wouldn't be bad, either, depending on the person -- but I'd just want to lay.

I think I am sad and tired because I am eating the oozy goodness that makes up cheesy fries at my school.  mmmm.  cheesy fries.

but then I feel gross, and that makes me lazy.  It's this vicious cycle, see?

feel lonely => cheesy fries => feel sad => procrastinate => work hard => feel lonely.

also.  a lot of my friends are in the middle of pledging.  Instead of greek life here, we have societies, and all of them are either initiating or being initiated...that's taking up a lot of their time.  I'm hanging out a lot with my friend courtney, but she's depressed so we're just tired and miserable together.

I have this issue with pride and independence, I don't want to feel like I <em>need</em> anybody.  So when there are lots of people around, I keep them at a distance.  But when they're scarce, I want to cry and shoot myself.  It's been like this for the past couple years.

I love our friendship.  You are wonderful.

I guess that's all i have to say.  I'm gonna go caffeine it up and do some work."

My friend, Renee, and I organized a game that accurately showed issues dealing with race, class and gender.  it was fun and took about an hour to process.  before that, she had given us a reading to do, ""it'll take about an hour"".  Renee and I went to sit on the couches across the hall...there we found Hana and we talked to her for an hour instead of reading.

I don't know where the other hour went.  Probaby debating, because there's this girl, vivian, who sucks and I don't like her so I'm going to attempt to FOIL HER every class period.

I took a sleeping pill last night and it was bad news because it took me three hours to pull myself up out of bed.  crazy.

What happened to the old sheryl crow?  or what happened to me, between the time I worshipped her and now?

Yesterday I was told that this girl, Carolyn, wants to 'do' me, which is scary because she looks like a giant dinosaur bird that will swoop down at any moment and devour me.  in the bad way.

yay for going backpacking with amanda!  that will be fun.

1) owes the library over a hundred dollars for overdue books and now they are sending her to collections
2) wants to take a roadtrip to CA with her friend that can't drive due to DUI charges and such...her parents are letting her take the hybrid, but want her to pay for her own gas
3) she dyed her hair and it sucks.

It's all her own fault...my responses were as follows:

1)  just turn the goddamn books in, stupid bitch.  Whore yourself to the bank manager ASAP and hopefully they won't send you to collections.
2)  They're letting you borrow their car.  I think it's pretty reasonable for them to ask for gas.  Can't you get Lindsey to help pay for gas?  ...She doesn't have a job?  Could you and your lush druggie friend drive her car?  Oh wait, she got her driver's license revoked and after that, her parents sold her car.  hm....that's true.
3)  don't dye your hair.  It's dry enough from all the puking you've been doing, you don't need to damage it anymore.

1)  I saw rachel, the pretty freckled girl.  Found out she was model from Colorado and that she's ""definitely bi-curious"", whatever that's supposed to mean.
2)

Some examples of the Phoenix Form are Quetzalcoatl<br>(Aztec), Shiva (Indian), and Ra-Atum<br>(Egyptian).
The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life,<br>the number 0, and the element of fire.

"event","So last night, I was working feverishly on my medieval philosophy paper (and completing as many james bond levels as possible).  I knew i'd be tired as fuck - so what my plan to consume as much caffeine in a small time period worked like a charm.  A bit too well, when 4:00 am passed and I was up, I was awake when the energizer bunny died at 6:00, I was there for to see the sun stretch its rays around 7:00-ish, the faucets and sinks to start running around 10:00 am.  The truth is, as well, that I had taken a vicodin around 5:00 am and was then scared because the combination of too much caffeine mixed with depressants, I'm told induces a heart attack.  Anyway, sleep came around 11:00 am, one hour before my paper was due.  I woke up around 12:30 at the sound of one of Meredith's residents banging on my door to return a dvd player she had borrowed.  My paper was due at noon.

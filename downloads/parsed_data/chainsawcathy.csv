"event","I had the strangest dream last night. I think it has something to do with my total lack of religion. Religion to me is something that may or may not happen. I'm waiting to see how I feel. I think this attitutde may be reflected in my totally fucked up dream.

I was married to a couple. I'm pretty sure this comes from Margaret Atwood's novel ""The Handmaiden's Tale."" Apparently I was a newly wed but the couple had been together. It was modern because I remember thinking about craigslist in the dream but we dressed like the Amish- the women at least. So the husband went out- it was night- and before I had sex with the husband I had to be made comfortable to the idea of sex with the wife. And I felt a bond with the wife. But in my fucked up dream before I had sex with the husband the wife would get me used to the idea and... feeling by sticking a Jesus on a stick umm... in me. This was to reiterate the holiness of the act. I realy really hated it and though it never happened in the situation in the dream I was dreaming the me who I was in the dream had done that before with the wife. Before I had sex with the husband I had to be comfortable with this whole Jesus stick thing. SoI hated the Jesus stick thing because I thought it was ultra creepy and the Jesus itself looked absolutely terrifying. And I confided to the wife how scared I was of it and how much I didn't like it and I thought we had an understanding.

But then the husband came home and the wife totally ratted me out. She had seemed so sympathetic when I was telling her how scary the Jesus was but apparently she was annoyed that I wouldn't get the show on the road. The husband was also really pissed and said that if I didn't start doing the Jesus thing he'd just rape me and forego the religiousocity of the event. I was scared and wanted to run away but there was nowhere for me to go. And this is when I thought of craigslist- and I also thought about the Handmaid's Tale like, ""why do they need me anyway? Is it because she can't have children?"" 

So we wake up the next morning and I am feeling scared about the whole practice sex Jesus thing and I'm scared of the husband but me and the wife go to the common room and do daytime stuff. I was playing a game with other wives and kids and I caught this little kid cheating at the game and called him out. Then we stopped playing. A few minutes later the mom of the cheater came up to me and said everyone was talking about me. Like I had to rat out a kid and everyone was saying how petty I was that I couldn't just overlook the kid, he was just a kid afterall. But I stood straight up and walked over to the kid (but it was also addressed to the room) and said, ""I don't care what you think about me or what people say about me. I am only judged by one person and that is God. So you may think I am petty but you are also a cheater and we must always follow the rules no matter how old or young we are. So I know that I am right and you are wrong. God knows that it is never right to cheat."" It was like a final speech in a movie and I go sit back down with my wife and she looks at me like I am the wisest person and says, ""what did that feel like?"" Like, how I could go and confront everyone like that? And I say with this huge smile and a sense of peace, ""It felt like God was telling me exactly what to say.""

I'm not exactly sure what this means... do I believe in God but am scared of it? Its very strange."

Also, staying until 5 is going to be challenging. But... for lunch I think I'm going to head home. I forgot to take my medicine this morning and usually it's no big deal because by the time I get home in the afternoon its fine because I just take it then. But today is a different story. It takes about a half hour in non rush hour train traffic to get home so I can be there and back in a little over an hour, which I think is totally acceptable for a lunch hour's activities.

I'm thinking leaving at one. So I'll get back around two- the time I usually leave, and I'll enter the twilight zone of the three hours between 2 - 5. Some activities to keep me busy today:

Write the lecture for Surrealism and Social Realism
Compile slides for said lecture
Make an accompanying slide list for the lecture
Watch ""Good Morning Vietnam""
Make a summer hours sign
Make an ""Out to Lunch"" sign
Scope out my classroom and check equipment so I don't look like a narbo the first day of class


This is all very do-able I think."

"event","I thought I could make it through my whole lecture today without a major break but I just can't take it anymore! I was on a roll from De Stijl all the way until Arp and Zurich Dada... but now the imposing and difficult to explain to 18 year olds Duchamp stands in my way. I think I could spend 5 fucking pages trying to explain his work to these kids and the required textbook (and you should already know how I feel about Stokstad's ""Concise History of Art."" If I was the type of person who burned books, that would be the first to go) only has a paragraph or two about him and the only work discussed is ""Fountain."" Seriously? What the fuck?

Not that I'm a terribly enthusiastic Duchamp fan but seriously, his impact on twentieth century art is arguably probably the most influential and important. And all they read is two paragraphs?! But even I can't handle him now. I'm way too exhausted from explaining Mondrian. I think I can finish... I just need a serious brain break. 

I think I want to tan again today... My burns have all but faded on my body but my nose and forehead are peeling. My plan would be to just put a towel on my face to protect it but I don't want to be judged by the orange men in very tight black t shirts who work at the place. But I also do not want to lose all the progress I have made on my limbs. I hate wearning nylons- they are itchy and uncomfortable but I also hate having sparkling white legs staring at everyone on the el.

Instead of falling asleep immediately I promise to do a load of dishes."

"event","Not surprisingly, I'm really bored of writing my lecture on Cubism. After this, I'll only have 4 1/2 more lectures to write and my class hasn't even started yet. But still, I am so over this, it is effin insane. Plus I'm still really run down from yesterday. 

So yesterday was the Walk and Roll for the American Cancer Association. 10 miles on skates right along the lake with crazy blowing wind. It was brutal. I almost gave up. But me and Lindsay stuck it out and finished all ten muthafucking miles. Did I mention that I got sick instantly the night before? So ten miles with a cold that included sore throat and runny nose. And then I HAD to play kickball with the other derby girls. One, because I love kickball and Two, because I want to know the skaters better so I can be more ""in"" for try outs. 

So I totally exhausted myself and fell asleep at 6ish all through the night. I missed hanging out with Smo except for a couple of hours and in those hours I was sleeping and totally exhausted and uncool. I am such a square... I was too tired and sick to go see his show at Jimmy's super cool house. So I was really upset this morning. Now I have an hour and twenty minutes left of work and I still just want to go home and sleep. 

And I've decided not to go to Orbit tonight. s much as I want to be a skater next year I am a ref THIS year and have to live up to my responsibilities. So scrimmage instead of Orbit. :( But I think a scrimmage practice would be nice. Nothing too crazy for my burning sore quadriceps from both Saturday and Sunday.

And secretly, I really really want to win that stupid ref award. Not that I think I'm the best ref... but I have done so much shit... I've volunteered for almost everything, I go to boot camp all the time and I think that my general dedication to the league has been up there. Even though I know most skaters don't even think about refs I want it so I can tell them how much they should appreciate us and everyone who volunteers for their show who don't get the recognition or adulation that they get.

I also got sunburned despite my best efforts. I'm so tired I could fall asleep right here."

But if I don't come back, then I won't look behind me
All of the things that I thought were so easy
Just got harder and harder each day

While out on the landing a friend I forgot to send home
Who waits up for me all through the night

And when I awoke I was sure it was true
I ran to the window; threw my head to the sky
And said whoever is up there,please don't let me die
But I can't live forever,I can't always be
One day I'll be sand on a beach by a sea
The pages keep turning, I'll mark off each day with a cross
And I'll laugh about all that we've lost

"event","There comes a time when you have to take a total break from working on a fucking long ass Impressionism lecture. I'm finally on to Post Impressionism but only to Seurat. I still have to get throught Cezanne, Rousseau, Gauguin, Van Gogh, and Lautrec. I'm already on page 6. Usually the lectures are 8 pages. Curse this life! I'm so tired of writing... stupid art history major :(

But at least next semester all of this will be done with because I'm teaching the same class. Hopefully the school won't screw with how I do my tests. I hope not. I swear, college kids these days are even worse than I was when I was in college and I was a severe fuck up for freshman year. But I had to memorize slides just like everyone else. I would never dream of giving a fucking multiple choice test in a college levell art history class. That is too stupid, really.

Only an hour left. I'd rather get all the slides together, I actually enjoy that part, but I can't put the slides together until the lecture is over. So I'm using my good art history textbook to lecture from. The book they have here is a joke. How can any sane person teach from a concise history book? Hello? The semester is 15 weeks. I think that warrants the full text. But what do I know? I'm only the teacher.

So do I plug on or do I do something else for an hour?......................................."

My friday night date with James was mediocre at best. So thats a big NO. This one dude Josh keeps bugging me. 4 phone calls and 2 emails in 4 days is a huge turn off. Plus I think he's socially retarded- much in the way my brother is. BUT Jeff is getting married in August. Ahhh another wedding I can attend alone and get totally smashed at. Christ. Speaking of smashed... Went to the Grand Rapids game and was out of my mind. 3 tequilla shots and 6 beers later I was puking out of the car on the side of the highway and saying ridiculous things I half remember. Sunday was more low key and went to derby and loafed around the house with Jimmy. 

TODAY:

I love Mondays and this one needs to be pretty fucking awesome. Does anyone know some single men that like chubby blondes? I give bare second on the first date."

I vounteered for AIDScare Chicago with the WCR. We hosted the event at a Korean restaurant. Too bad I hate Korean food! Of all the Asian foods, which I all love, except maybe Vietnamese... but anyway. Gross. The best part was getting drunk with Abacus. He is an interesting dude. We played themovie game and I kicked his ASS! Oh how derby boy underestimate their competition. Especiall Unk, Judgement Dave and Abacus. I was the dark horse, dude. Office- HILARIOUS!

RYAN: He basically is man, he's a regular banking wizard.

Had to drive to work because I woke up late as shit! And I hate to drive to work. I relly enjoy reading on the train. :( So I actually spent most of today doing my actual job. Note- its not quite enough to fill the day but it came pretty darn close. When I leave I'm gonna go get some eye black at Sports Authority for the game tomorrow. Then... I have to take a shower. I also said I'd help put up padding at the practice space and then... Hot date with James! She blinded me with library science... oh man. Hopefully it will not suck balls."

Went and bought a new vibrator with Lindsay and Jimmy. I also got a handy book to help me find that fucking G Spot! Lidsay took us out to dinner at Chicago Diner. Now all I want ever is their Reuben. A veggie Reuben and a G Spot orgasm and my life will be perfect. Michael called me at midnight thirty telling me he was going to kill himself. That it was good I didn't meet him because he is awful and should die. What to do? Of course someone who is threatening suicide is more likely to do it than someone who is not. So I did what I could over the phone and never having met him in person. I don't want to be insensitive but Jesus, what is with all this drama and we haven't even met?! I can't take it. Contrary to popular opinion, I am not everybody's personal cheerleader. I made arrangements for a date with James on Friday. He has a shirt that says, ""She blinded me with library science."" *swoon* 

TODAY:

I am not sure but I have a pretty good idea it is still 1:52 at the Harrison Red Line. Today was so nice I walked from Jackson Blue Line instead. I discovered I might be beginning to get an ear infection. My ear aches. I had a meeting with my boss and another sort of boss about the Resource Room and apparently the Dean wants to get rid of it. Shit shit shit shit. I need my awesome job. If Columbia screws me I will be totally pissed. I will burn Utica to the ground! So now I have to do a budget proposal. Hello? I have an MA in art history, doesn't that prove I suck at math? I have no idea how to do a budget! But so far my work on the budget has consisted of 3 emails to other people. Hopefully I can do what I always do and just use their budget as a template and do my own based on someone else's work and experience. I may be screwed indeed. Tonight I'm volunteering for derby stuff to do with dining out for AIDs. This is projected to be 5 hours of whatever. I need a free meal."

As if you couldn't tell, yesterday I was left hanging and had the opinion that Michael was a total douche bag. BUT as I whined to Lindsay and Hermione, he just seems so great, other than the fact that us hanging out in the near future is probably not going to happen. It just seems as if we'd get along really well. We have so much in common and... he pretty fuckin cute and he likes me too. We can actually talk about books! Its mind blowing actually. And I know when people tell me he's a douche bag they are right. Hermione even said, ""It's not what you like, its what you are like."" But its pretty easy for them to toss away boys left and right beause all of them have significant others or at least a nice imitation of one. Boys don't often come along my way. And it seems like such a waste to give up on this one already when I've made so much progress.

TODAY:
It is actually 1:52 at the Harrison Red Line, I've been reaing it wrong all month. I finished lecture, slides and slide list for Mannerism. Tomorrow I'll do the Baroque and Rococo. Maybe I should bring in the Janson's I have... and also the book from SAIC because the book they use here is a piece of shit. I was asked out this morning crossing the street from Dunkin Donuts to Columbia. 

""Are you married?""

Best.
Pick up line.
Ever. 

Too bad he looked like a douche.

So after completing the lecture etc. I saw that Michael was online so I asked him WTF? And he said he had been called away from his desk, thats why he hadn't said anything. He said, ""like I said, just go to gr."" 
     ""So you're not coming over?""
     ""I don't want you counting on me to come and if I don't you'll be stuck doing nothing.""
     ""Alright, whatever.""

Lame! Got home from work and The Tudors had finished downloading. Spectacular. You know how much I love period drama soft core porn. HOT! 

I talked with Michael about Post Office online. It is hard to type about a book. That's more of a talking conversation but he was at work so we couldn't really discuss at our best. We talked a little about crap and eventually stopped. I took a short nap and was looking forward to practice with the Chicago Outfit that night at Orbit. 

Unk and Vroom said there were openings for some refs to take the night off so I jumped at it and told Hermione to do it too so we could get to Orbit right at the beginning of practice. But alas, I got a message from one of the Outfit ladies that said Jodi was closing Orbit because she couldn't be there. So I didn't get to skate at all. Hermione and I were extra pissed.

James emailed me and perhaps we will go for a drink. Who knows. Most guys I meet are total flakes with no follow-through. This week might be no good though. 

Hopefully Michael will actually come into town this weekend.

It is still 2:52 at the Harrison Red Line. I can't do any real work because I emailed my lectures to myself last night and the mail server at Columbia is down so I can't get them and rearrange things and put together slide shows.

Had a fitful night of sleep. I hadn't taken my anti-depressants so I keep getting electrical zaps through my body that would wake me up. I also had some gas pain or cramping that made me dream I had eaten airplane parts in an attempt not to fly. Woke up hungover with my parents.

SATURDAY:

Text message from Michael: ""Still in bed. Not coming. Call me later if you want.""

Drinks consumed at the reception:
5 Raspberry Vodka and Sprite
3 Glasses Red Wine

I wore the same thing in the morning as I did to the reception. I made one drunken phone call to Michael and left rambling message. Passed out in a King size bed in my mom's pajamas.

BACK TO YESTERDAY:
Drove home around 9. Went to the pharmacy to pick up my anti-depressants. Took one and regular medication at home. Fell asleep until 4 pm. Text messaged Michael: ""Where have you been?"" As to the no response to my drunken phone call. 

Katamari.

Text to Lindsay: ""Where did you go?""

Katamari. Pizza.

Lindsay returns from Matt's set. I am bored out of my mind. So I went onto craigslist and watched a dude jerk off on his webcam. Kind of disgusting. I felt so grossed out (mind you, I thought this would be interesting, maybe sexy) I took a shower right after. Talked to Ambrose online and told him I would never ge over him. Michael IMed me. No mention of messages or an apology for not coming to the wedding. He is sick and signs off to go home and eat saying he will come back on afterwards.

By now it is 11 and I get ready for bed. Watch an episode of Metalocalypse with Lindsay. Then I go to bed without hearing from Michael.

""I give new meaning to the phrase, ""Sleep All Day.""""

Crazy, when I woke up today at 5 I thought it was 5 am and to my amazement it was 5pm...

1. Finish my Thesis ON TIME! I do not want to be one of those kids who think that they can finish their thesis in the summer. No way! It will be done at the end of school.

Ummm. I did finish my Thesis on time but not until August. I actually did finish it during the summer.

2. Graduate from Graduate School.

Check

3. Keep in touch with the Glessner House just in case Claire quits and there is a new opening for an Educational Director...

Oh man, Jennifer got that job and was then fired and the Glessner House is in dire financial straits. So it was probably a good thing I didn't get that job.

4. Do a really good job assisting Debra with the Artful Fictions class.

Check

5. Do a really good job teachimg my own Survey class.

Check

6. Go see a neurologist in Chicago.

Check- somewhat. I have a new psychiatrist in Chicago.

7. Go to a dentist in Chicago.

Ummm.... not so much.

8. Go to Chicago Women's Health Center.

Ummm.... not so much

9. Keep up with Weight Watchers and lose all the weight I put on when I moved to Chicago.

Had to quit in the summer due to no money because of no job. But I lost some more weight with the Derby.

10. Apply for a job in the summer at the Chicago Historical Society.

Not so much. I applied for a job but no call back.

11. Think about moving or staying... this probably rests on if I get a job or not.

I'm staying, for another year at least.

12. Get a distributor for my friggin comic and get it out of my hall!

Still in the hall.

13. Submit a story for the Chicago artists anthology.

Not so much


So I really didn't do a ton of the things I planned to do but I did do some unexpected things...

This year...

1. Make the derby team this time!

2. Do a good job as a ref.

3. Keep up doing whatever at Columbia. Maybe move that shit up to full time or what.

4. Do good teaching my own class.

5. Get a boyfriend.

6. Take more pictures.

7. Finish my log cabin quilt.

8. Be more clean around the house.

9. Say what I mean.

10. Kick guitar hero's ass."

I don't want to want anymore. Dissapointment is the worst feeling in the world. And I wish I had some comfort. From anyonne. But it seems as though just as soon as I was their friend I don't matter anymore now that I didn't make the team. Noone has written me an email, noone has called. I would do it for them- speak on their behalf, ask people to reconsider, to at least say something and try to comfort them. I suppose their happiness is equal to my saddness and they've forgotten me. But everyone else seems to have their own troubles and I always feel like I am alone and that was the one thing I wanted from Derby. To not feel alone anymore. But Meredith is still in Columbus witha whole new set of friends. I feel like she slips away from me all the time. Mike will not move to Chicago for any reason. Lindsay needs to attend to Melanie. And I am still alone. I was there for everyone else. I was their cheerleader. I wanted to be so positive to be so motivated and to life everyone else around me. But I feel as if it didn't even matter. Its like drowning and nobody is coming to rescue me and I am so tired of rescuing myself."

"event","My quest to being on the Windy City Rollers has begun. Chances are lookin good. However my ass hurts like nothing else.

So yesterday I went to the Orbit ""So you wanna be in the derby practice."" This is not affiliated with either of the teams from Chicago. However, one oof our refs was there as a ref from the Sirens. One girl from the Sirens was there as I didn't recognize her and she had a derby name on her shirt. Dina Discipline from WCR was there. The Sire had two friends with her so I'm not worried about them so much as I think they are going to try out for the Sirens. Two mysterious women were there- and older lady who obviously speed skates who was wearing a walkman the whole time and just skating around in the circle. She seemed to know another girl who was pretty good. I think we were evenly matched. Then there were two people a boy and girl who were working with Dina. They both sucked. So that left me and the Asian girl I had spoken to on the WCR message board. She was okay- not very fast but working on lunges and such.

I got the bearings in my cruddy speed skates changed. They are Chicago Bullets and they came with ABEC 1s. To which Meredith aka Hayley Vomit cried out in horror at. So I had the skate shop lady change the bearing to ones I bought. They are the Swiss manufactured China Reds, which she said were equivelent to ABEC 7s. So with upgraded skates I took to the floor. At first I just kinda skated around to get a feel for my skates and didn't speak to anyone. Then I saw Dina doing all this stuff with those two people so I asked if I could join in. She told me about the squat skate and how it helps to do the crossover on corners. So I did that for awhile. But since I had never done it like that before I feel on my ass. But I had decided to just go for things, after all thats why I had pads. So I got pretty good at the corner cross thing in the squat. Bu other than that I didn't work on much else. I just tried to stay on the floor, I was effing tired after only 45 minutes and my skates were hurting my feet.

But all in all I think I did pretty well. Next time I'll ask the ref to show me to do the T stop as the few attempts I made were abismal. I also need  to work on falling well as my one attempt at that also sucked.

Word on the street is a lot of girls are retiring this year which makes me feel a little better about my odds. So until then I will do my leg work outs and keep skating at Orbit and go to all of the meets and such.

      <H1>Your Score: <SPAN>Brute</SPAN></H1>
      <H2>You are 42% Rational, 0% Extroverted, 71% Brutal, and 57% Arrogant.</H2>
       <DIV id=""testResultInfoImg""><IMG src=""http://is0.okcupid.com/users/156/664/1566642811609810544/mt1114812039.jpg""></DIV> 
      <P>
      You are the Brute!  You are introverted, arrogant, brutal, and more intuitive than rational.  Like a big, dumb animal, you are driven by your emotions more than your reason, and as a result of the fact that you care very little for the feelings of others, you tend to be rather selfish.  You also possibly fling your own poo.  Because of your selfishness, you also tend to be a bit arrogant, seeing yourself as big or strong or smart or always correct.  This makes you a stubborn, irrational, emotion-driven brute.  King Kong best represents the gorilla-version of your personality.  Emotional, introverted (King Kong was isolated on his own island, after all), brutal, and arrogant (proud to be the largest ape on Earth!), Kong would probably get along very well with you, seeing as how you share many of the same traits.  Aside from, you know, all the fur.  You probably keep to yourself and take great pleasure in watching fat people fall down stairs.  (But who doesn't, really?)  You probably also have dreams of becoming famous or well-known, but this most likely won't happen because your introversion limits your Hollywood connections.  Being introverted, ape-like, and arrogant isn't so bad, though.  It beats being dead.  So your personality defect is simply that you act like a large, overgrown ape that thinks highly of itself whilst brutalizing buxom blondes.  Or something.

<P>
I am a self-proclaimed pseudo-intellectual who loves dashes.  I enjoy science, philosophy, and fart jokes and water balloons, not necessarily in that order.  I spend 95% of my time online, and the other 5% of my time in the bathroom, longing to get back on the computer.  If, God forbid, you somehow find me amusing instead of crass and annoying, be sure to check out my blog and my webcomic at <A href=""http://www.saintgasoline.com"">SaintGasoline.com</A>.

- - - -

Richard Nixon and Winston Churchill

NIXON: Hello, I see you're smoking a cigar and wearing a large hat.

CHURCHILL: So I am, young chap. Could I interest you in a cigar? I began smoking cigars while in Cuba in 1895. I also have a very large hat collection.

NIXON: Sure, I think I smoke cigars ... maybe ... I don't know. I am not a known smoker but I suppose for the age... I will share a cigar with you.

(CHURCHILL hands a cigar to NIXON, who bites off the tip and lights it.)

NIXON: We were probably alive at the same time. I was born in 1913 and died in 1992.

CHURCHILL: Indeed, my boy, indeed. I was born in 1874 and died in 1965. I had something to do with World War II and I think maybe you fought in it. I was prime minister of England during World War II and was a fierce opponent of communism. My beef was mostly with the Russian Bolsheviks.

NIXON: I'm not sure if I did. Oh wait, yes... I was a reserve officer in the Navy. I commanded cargo units in the south Pacific. I also hated commies and was embroiled in the Vietnam War.

CHURCHILL: There's not that much more about me that everyone knows. Except I owned many racehorses, was a painter during the 1930s, and had a speech impediment- stuttering.

NIXON: I once held up my hands and formed two peace signs. I was either about to get onto a plane or get off of one. Oh wait, it was when I was departing the white house after my resignation. So I was getting on the plane.

CHURCHILL: I have seen the photo, because I think there were cameras when I was alive. Oh yes, the camera was invented in the 1800s. And I stated that the V for victory hand signal was made for cartoonists.

NIXON: And what about Watergate? I did that.

CHURCHILL: Margaret Thatcher is someone else from England. She was leader after me.

NIXON: People can buy masks of my face.

CHURCHILL: We never met but I was entertained by Aristotle Onassis on his yacht.

NIXON: I was in the same hospital as Jackie Onassis at the time of my death. She died one month later in the same hospital as me."

So... I got the easy part over with, checking my goals from last year and charting my progress. What is it I ant to do this year...

1. Finish my Thesis ON TIME! I do not want to be one of those kids who think that they can finish their thesis in the summer. No way! It will be done at the end of school.

2. Graduate from Graduate School.

3. Keep in touch with the Glessner House just in case Claire quits and there is a new opening for an Educational Director...

4. Do a really good job assisting Debra with the Artful Fictions class.

5. Do a really good job teachimg my own Survey class.

6. Go see a neurologist in Chicago.

7. Go to a dentist in Chicago.

8. Go to Chicago Women's Health Center.

9. Keep up with Weight Watchers and lose all the weight I put on when I moved to Chicago.

10. Apply for a job in the summer at the Chicago Historical Society.

11. Think about moving or staying... this probably rests on if I get a job or not.

12. Get a distributor for my friggin comic and get it out of my hall!

13. Submit a story for the Chicago artists anthology."

"event","As 2006 winds down it is time, once again, for my annual year in review in which I post goals I have written a year ago, update as to the outcomes, and plan for new goals.

This year was okay. Going to grad school, working at two house museums in Chicago, working at the art history office and having Theory class breakdowns. I swear to God- sometimes I just want to stab Foucault- if he wasn't already dead... or wait, stabbing a corpse would still be satisfying. I think this was the year of ""Cathy Dates Crazies"" three dumb guys in different dumb ways (each more terrifying than the last.) And also ""Cathy works her ass off and has major meltdowns of self doubt in her ability to research and write."" Intellectually and Romantically I have been a mess. This new year has crazy things hovering about...


2006 RESOLUTIONS

1. Learn how to Quilt and Knit, and be good at it and keep it up all year.

Ehhhh... I have made some quilted projects through the years, which included accessories to the kitchen and several attempts at knitting an ear warmer but completing two mousies for Lucy and Ricky.

2. Get the coloring and computer layout stuff done on the comic so it can be shipped to the printer's by February

It was done in March...

Try to get a distributer

ah... still don't have that one...

Mail copies to publishers.

ouch... haven't really done that...

3. Get it finished by the time Chicago Con rolls around late summer and have a both to sell my comic.

Check! Got it done, got the booth, sold a shitload of comics! It was one of my favorite things I have done in life so far.

4. Get a book release signing at Quimbys.

Check! Opening was in May. Although I mostly sold books to my friends- I did have an opening at Quimbys. 

5. Be more active.
This goes along with the lose weight resolution I make every year. But as long as I feel like I am exercising and getting up off the couch the weight loss will be just a bonus. Perhaps I will get Carmen Electra's Stripper Workout. It looks fun.

I rode my bike a lot in the spring and summer. As of late have been pretty immobile.

6. Make some friends. 
I am so lonely in Chicago. An addendum to this resolution will be added such as going out with the Art History kids when they ask me to come to wine night or a bar instead of being a loser and not going because I don't like walking homme from the El at night.

Semi-check! I have made better friends with the guys in art history and with Shay. Still no really close friends though...

7. Apply for summer internship at Glessner House (a historic house museum in Chicago)

Check! Got it!

8. When I like someone I will tell them. No more pining away and being a dork. I am no longer in High School having secret crushes. I will be an adult about dealing with boys.

Semi-check! Although it turns out no matter what I say or do... guys run from me like the plague and... the comic book dosen't help. They all think I'm going to draw about them.

9. Keep in touch with Savannah friends.

Check! More or less... and some of it gets me in trouble."

We each assigned out students a different midterm and this one girl had an insane assignment. Now, I believe that undergrads get away with quite a bit- but I also understand that most of these kids are BFA and are required to take this crappy class...

I think these guys have a serious power trip issue. And I'm not trying to be the ""cool"" TA but I'm trying to understand their position. I expect work... but I don't expect and art history major caliber paper. I expect a basic understanding of how to write art historically but jesus, some of these misterms are outta control. Its really sad. And apparently one TA totally emailed her students and bitched them out for not showing up to the practice exam. Hello? The practice exam was NOT manditory. These guys can study or not study any way they damn please. The TAs are not their mothers, seriously folks. Do I give a shit if my students don't go to the practice exam? No... because honestly, when I was an undergrad freshman I probably wouldn't have gone either. The survey class is a pain in the ass. I know that- and even the chair of the art history department knows that. It's not a cake class but it's not some huge big deal. Show up, take the tests, do the papers- or not. It's their education. 

Relax girls. You take yourselves way too seriously."

The agony of going to school full time while having a 20 hour a week job plus being a TA and trying to explain to undergrads that yes, I didn't give a shit about ancient cave paintings either but this is what you have to do when you go to art school. And then as if I wasn't already freaking out about having to write a 
T H E S I S !! FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! I decided to add a little more misery to my life by being an intern at Glessner House for no money. Even if I had friends I would never be able to hang out. I can hardly find time to email all my students or actually think of what a Masters in Art History with an emphasis on Decorative Art primarily quilting will get me besides a whole lotta debt and a million books written by Foucault (stab) Kant (stab stab) and Lacan (stab stab stab) Why couldn't I have been just a comic book superstar like I planned and then I wouldn't be filling my mind with crazy shit about image and self image and scopiphilia and discourses and that my sexuality is not my own and all the other shit that will fuck me up for the rest of my life. I can see why Philosophy majors have the highest rate of suicide followed in a close second by history majors. I wonder where Art History, Theory, and Criticism falls in the food chain..."

"event","I can't take it anymore! I think the reason I have been single for 5 and a half years is because dating someone is an unyielding circus of shit.  Plus I get to do what I want- when I want- and sit wherever the fuck I feel like in movie theaters. Although, I do these things alone. Yes, it's true... Being single has its ups and downs. Everybody knows that. But I think that being alone for so long has stunted my relationship growth. And I'll tell you why:

1. I am set into my ways like a woman over seventy. I like my rountine in a way that I find myself turning down two very good offers to go to parties last Friday night because... I looked into the future and saw myself at either of these parties and concluded that neither would be spectacularly fun in any sense. I would be standing around talking to the two people I knew (at either party) a slowly nursing cheap beer and waiting until I stayed long enough to look polite and then going home. So I realized I just wanted to stay at home anyway. Which I did. Alone, watching tv and falling asleep around 10:30 which I concluded was a more enjoyable night than going out.

2. I'm not so good in realtionships. I am a much better friend than girlfriend. Ask everybody in Savannah. I was the cool girl. The girl in the group full of guys. I was not datable but I was best friend materiel. You can put your head on my lap when your drunk but as far as any other sort of body contact- no dice. This comfort level with boys is nice and anything above this makes me feel queesy and stupid. And as much as I wanted to like Derrick I couldn't help but think as we were making out, ""this is stupid. I feel stupid.""

3. I am not ashamed that I am still a virgin. However, whenever I meet anyone it becomes this enormous BIG DEAL. Ohhh don't wanna get involved with her... too much work... too much expectation... no sex right away in that dumbass twentysomething way. And because of this- I feel that I must remain alone until I become a joke and they make a movie out of me. Or I should just resolve myself to no sex before marriage so people will be able to comprehend why a 25 year old is still a virgin. They are baffeled as it is explained now. I am so pissed Ambrose didn't come up for the con because I was pretty resolved to have sex with him. Just get it over with with one of my best friends so it wouln't be weird or retarded after and then I wouldn't have to have ""the talk"" which destroys a man's interest in me within 5 seconds.

I am in the worst mood ever."

And it wasn't for that sweet sweet $300 that I will no longer be getting... I didn't really want to do it for the money. I wanted to be the kind of Orientation Leader I didn't get. When I went to SCAD for orientation the thing was the biggest nightmare carnival of souls ever. My OL was a spaz with no compassion or relatability. And I hated her guts. I wanted to tell freshmen what noone told me, I wanted to be someone that they would not feel stupid asking where the library was or how to get whereever and which clinics offered Plan B etc. I am pissed and dissapointed.

"event","Today, as I was walking to work, started out with a heart attack.

I walk out my apartment door and head for the el. To give you some context I was wearing: A black v neck short sleeved top with a gather at the bust, a white, pleated skirt with cherries on it from Target- kind of short but my ass was not hanging out-, and the cropped, black tights with black flats. Fun enough to be me but dressy enough for the office. So I start my walk going following the direction of traffic down the one way street in front of my house. A white van drives by and I hear the all too familiar cat call whistle. I ignore the first one. The driver leans out the window and whistles again obviously irked that I didn't smile at him for his unwelcome ogling. So I yell after the car, ""Asshole!"" I turn left down another steet going against the one way traffic and begin to wonder if that was the smartest thing to do. I have often scolded Lindsay for her more than aggressive ""Assholes!"""" and ""Fuck yous!"" to the whistling men of Chicago. I think, ""I just told a total stranger he was an asshole. What if he is some crazy fuck and comes after me to yell at me? What if he has buddies in the car and in order to save face in front of his group they get out of the car and assalt me or something?"" To my horror a white van is coming down the street toward me. I am paralyzed by fear. What is he going to do to me? And I never do this to people who whistle at me. The man leans out the window and says, ""Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean no offense. I'm sorry."" And stunned I say, ""That's okay but women don't like that. It makes us feel weird."" I had about a million other more practical and intellegent retorts other than ""it makes us feel weird"" but I couldn't do it.

But good for that man. I hope he thinks twice before ogling. 

I do not like to be cat called at because it's like- it's accepted that men can judge our bodies and whistle approval. I don't do that to attractive men I see. Nor would it be acceptable if I said, ""Hey pretty, pretty. You look very handsome today."" It's an aggressive act. And it makes me feel- not pretty or appreciated by men- but at the mercy of them. It's okay that I tell you what I think of you in whistles and lewd suggestions- good for you I'm too tired to get out of my car or I'd show you how pretty I thought you were by taking off your pants and molesting you."

"event","Yesterday morning Lindsay and I had quite the squirrel adventure.

I was cleaning up and doing the dishes in the kitchen. I walked into the living room either to put the trash bag by the door or to pick up cans or whatnot from the living room when I see Salty meowing and pawing at the screen on the window. I had opened them earlier because it was so hot but left the screen down... You know cats and what not. So I go over to see what he's interested in. On the ledge of our second story window there is a little baby squirrel. Not a baby- more like a 10 year old or something. I call for Lindsay who was still in bed with Melanie although I knew they were awake because I had heard them talking and laughing. Lindsay comes out and looks. The little thing is shaking because Salty scared the shit out of it. And he can't get down. We don't know how he even got on the ledge. There is a large tree across from our window but not jumping distance for a small squirrel. So she calles Melanie and I lock Salty in my room to keep him away from the squirrel. I suggest Lindsay call animal control because it looks like he's stuck on the ledge. She calls and they say, ""we can't come out for squirrels on second story windows."" So we don't know what to do. It's stuck but we don't want to pick it up because it is a wild animal and may have diseases or scratch, claw, or freak out on us. So I get a large canvas bag and hold it out on the ledge to the squirrel. It wants to get in the apartment instead of the bag. But finally it gets in the bag and I close the top. It's freaking out in the bag trying to claw out the top where I'm holding it closed and so I freak out because I don't want it to claw my hand or jump out of the bag in the building. so I run down the stairs screaming, ""Lindsay! It's trying to get out! Lindsay! Open the Goddamn door!"" So she opens the door and I put the bag on the ground. The squirrel won't get out so I open the door and shake the bag a little. The squirrel seems unfazed and goes to the window grate of the basement apartment."

But I figure I'm doing pennance for my other job in which I do five times as much work that I do for this job with a dollar less an hour. I guess I am like Seinfield... Everything just evens out for me. 

I am so close to finishing the computer touch up work on my comic I can taste it. So soon will I send it to WestCan and actually print my first real comic book with bar code and everything. I know tattooed ISBN barcodes are cheesy but it would be cool to have it on me and I could be rung up as ""'Winter Beard' $6."" Not going to happen but fun to think about.

So today I think I'll lay down on the office couch and do some reading.

"event","Well Donna is still mad at me and I can understand. Well She won't look my way and I try so hard. Well i cried so hard to day and I prayed for the first time in like six or seven years. I prayed for the strenght to get over my problems. I don't know what  to do everyone expects me to be the goody two shoes the kiss up, so how can I just go to my mom or someone and say I need help. how can i do it? It seems so unreal to me, I just can't seem to control my toughts anymore the other day because I am so hooked on this Fucken Drug I did it in class. I didn't get cought but what if I would have. i don't know what to do anymore.I know Donna is going to be even more mad at me and I am sorry. I want to stop and I just can't anymore I am just stuck in the spider web and no one is able to cut me out because I am not making any noise. Well I don't know what to do I am thinking about calling my counselor but I hate going to the counselor he just stares at me. I know it is just the pychology thing but I want some one that is going to ask questions and listen to me. I need some one that understands were I am coming from because these counslors don't truly know they hear stories but they never have lived it. Well I am thinking about telling my mom that I need help and going and getting help but I am still unsure how to tell her. This is worse then when I told her that I am gay. I don't know how she is goign to respond because of what it is. Well I guess I need to stop whining and suck it up talk to you later.

Will see what happens.
Lots of love
Stay strong and I will Try
I LOVE YOU DONNA!!!!!!
tHANK YOU FOR BEING YOU!!"

"event","Well It has been a long time sense i have talked I guess I am still unsure if I want everyone to know my life. It seems wierd to me but I have so much to say and I don't know were to turn and maybe someone will be able to help. I have been doing crack and my life is going down the drain and i don't know what to do. i spend so much money on it and I don't care about school. I know I need to stop but it is not a easy to stop like that. I would turn to my mother but she has so many of her own problem that I don't want to add more but I don't want to get worse. my mother is fighting with my stepdad all the time and his brother and sister is living in there house that i don't even live in but that is not the point my mother is hurting and I cann't stop it because I can't stop my own pains. i don't want to just go up to someone and say Ineed help but don't tell my mother because i know that would never happen. well I am all yacked out and can't concentrate but this is the only time I feel normal.
Lots of Love 
Help me Out!!
and you will get it back some how."

"event","i didn't think a week could pass so slowly.

man alive, where to start?  things this week have been pretty awesome.  i flew to north dakota to visit a couple friends of mine, and that all went well.  we drove on up to Canada and wandered around without any direction in mind.  i get a kick out of things like that.  a total lack of plans.

now that i'm back though, it means time to get back to work and the whatnot.  i at least still have this weekend free, but monday.. i really do not want to go back to the norm, but i'll live.  ah, something i returned to is a busted out passenger-side window.  that was no good... my stereo was stolen, along with my owners manual, but other than that, no other vandalism.  i have a $100 deductable, and i don't think sound equipment is covered... so i'm just going to go buy a cheapy CD player and toss that in there, and get the window replaced.  i was thinking of duct taping a clear trashbag to the window, but i'm not that ghetto.  at least, not that i'm aware of.  mmm...."

"event","for some damn reason, i'm addicted to The Apprentice.  that is such a lovely show.  back when the show Big Brother first came out several years back, i got pretty hooked on that.  i would've done anything to be a part of the household, but alas... i was a smidge too young.  who'd have thought that reality TV would've come this far.  i'm not even much of a tv watcher, truth be told.. i watch maybe 5 hours a week.  meh, that's enough for me.  i got my 1 hour in tonight.  that's all that's important.

so i was thinking about going skydiving.  anyone ever have an experience with that and/or bungee jumping.  i've done nothing ""extreme"", save for maybe ice skating, but i'm sure that hardly counts.  i played baseball, too.. but again, that hardly counts.  what are some of the more extreme things ya'll have done?  i think the most extreme thing i tried doing was going over a garden hose on a skateboard.  mmmhmmm.  brought the board to a complete stop, and i landed on my face.  interesting times..."

"event","today was what one might call a ""scattered"" day.  i wasn't quite sure what i should get done, but there were a few things on my todo list.  first and foremost was getting my digicam back from a guy from work, but he left about 10 minutes before i got there.  that sucked a smidge.

so what's the second best thing to do?

go see a movie about jesus.  i hadn't seen The Passion yet, but figured i should get around to it.  there was a strong christian background that my dad tried instilling on me as i grew up, and really.. i think it helped me out in the longrun, but man... that was kind of morbid, watching a movie like that.  all the people, sitting there with their popcorn and sodas.  i think ultimately, that made me more upset than the movie itself, but really after it all, i still consider myself agnostic.  there's a lot to take in spiritually on so many different levels from so many different cultures, and i could expand on that, but i won't.  religion should be saved for a later date.

i drove around a lot tonight.  picked up a frame for a poster i had bought off of eBay for the movie Lost In Translation.  i like buying hard to find movie posters, and this one was the Hong Kong movie release version.  cost me a pretty penny to get it, but i'm quite pleased with it.  it'll definitely add character to my walls.  for now though, im going to wander off.  tomorrow, i have a long day of nothing to do.  if only i could find an oil change place that is open.... hmMMMmmm...."

"event","so here i go.  not quite sure where to start with this thing, but i figured i'd just jump right in.  middleground first.

i'm kevin.  not a whole lot to me, really.  i work fulltime at a lovely retail outlet that will go unnamed for now, sit around my house naked provided that nobody is home, and i ocassionally will drive around with no direction in mind.

that is me.

for now though, i must go shower, despite the fact that it is 9 at night.  typically, im a shower in the morning kind of guy, but i feel like ive been sunburned which in turn makes me feel dirty, which is completely nonundestandable... for, i have not been out in the sun at all today.

go figure."

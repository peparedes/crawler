"event","I know i haven't wrote in quite some time but i really haven't had anything worthwhile to transcribe from my head to my keyboard, besides people have been really good to me lately about listening to my bitching so i really haven't had to use this....

Where to begin lets start with girls.....

The girl that is my double is acting odd, but i mean she is me so like me im not exactly the only member of the opposite sex that im sure she is interested in, just like how she isnt the only girl who i have an interest in.

The girl that would have resulted in uber drama if anything happened between us i really haven't been talking to much, so its just kind of out of sight out of mind.

Of course a new one had to come like out of left field and totally rock my world, easily one of the more amazing persons ive meet while living on this planet, the only problem is that she lives quasi far away, but not like where i wouldnt be able to see her ever far away if that makes any sense.

Now onto the Work situation, i was supposed to go into dominoes tonight but i just no called no showed, its not worth my time or effort, i broke even working there last weekend and all im doing is putting miles on my car.

Target is going surprisingly well right now actually, im starting to enjoy working there again, ive learned how to make it fun and not take things so seriously, COBRAS TAKING IT BACK '04!!!

School starts back up next week, it sounds like my mom would prefer for me to stay at home and do the community college thing for a while and knock out some more of my debt, I told my mom the whole reason why i wanted to rush back to western is that i feel like a total loser still living at home and living at home at 20/21 wasnt exactly what i had planned with my life, she reassured me that she wasnt ready to kick me out yet, so thats a positive for the most part.

So i think the plan is as follows im going to re-apply for a promotion at work, if i get it im going to stick around for at least a year and probably move out of the house and get some people together and rent an apartment or a house (if i could get enough people together for a house that would be so rad it wouldn't even be funny)

But if i dont get the promotion i will be heading back to school at january.

I dont know im going to talk to jen about it, i know she keeps brining up how she wants to get an apartment but cant find any one to live with blah blah blah"

"event","A brand new journal how fucking amazing.

Basically the old one has to many bad memories attached to it, to many failed relationships to many low points of my life. Its smooth sailing from here on out bitches.

Things have been going fairly good for me, i have learned to not care about Target so working there is almost sort of becoming fun again? i dont get it, ive noticed that 90% of my frustrations stem from working in the fucking electronics department.

I just got a 2nd job tonight delivering pizzas, basically i plan on using all that money to buy shit that i feel as if i need but cant afford.

I plan on buying the following

-I-pod Mini (Lime Green)
-Lip Piercing
-Exploding Heart Tattoo (Left Arm)
-Master Shake Tattoo (Location TBA)

The only major drama in my life is that two hot incredible good looking girls are both interested me at the same time and i have to pick one over the other.

Das Sigh. Its a bitch being me some times....."

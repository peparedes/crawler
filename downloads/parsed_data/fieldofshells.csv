Today, 9,387 pieces of marble mark the graves of the brave American men who gave their lives to literally save the free world. Let us remain forever grateful, and never forget. To each and every one of those brave men, Thank you."

"event","<i>One of the great scandals of our age is the fact that America spends more on food than any other nation. Many political leaders are now calling for urgent reform to bring spending on food under control. While food spending is rapidly increasing and many Americans are overweight, some do not have enough to eat.

Despite this high spending, the United Nations reports that, according to surveys they sent to government officials around the world, the quality of U.S. food is ranked very low. Officials in France report that their food is the best in the world. More insulting is the higher ranking that British experts give their food...

...Congress and the administration say they will achieve further efficiencies by prohibiting all advertising of food and food products. Consumers will find shopping much easier if personal preference is eliminated in favor of whatever foods government makes available.

To better control costs, the government will invest billions in new electronic food purchasing records. Everything you eat will be reported to the government, which will analyze the data to eliminate wasteful or unhealthy eating. All new food must be approved by a new Comparative Calorie and Taste Administration, which, for example, would eliminate most of the unnecessary brands of potato chips. And as anyone knows, we have far too many brands of beer.

Food is surely a right, as it is necessary for survival. Therefore all groceries available in government commissaries will be free of charge...

Reportedly, the clincher for those proposing grocery nationalization was stated recently by the White House: ""The great thing about these proposals is that if we can somehow get this to work for groceries, we can apply the same idea to health care.""

"event","<i>I urge you to keep in place the protections for healthcare providers which which are now under consideration. Nothing owned by humans is more precious than the right of conscience, save for the right to life itself. Imagine a world where Martin Luther King, Jr. or Ghandi were forbidden to act in concert with their conscience. And let there be no doubt-a right to conscience without the right to act upon that conscience is no right at all, and anyone who seeks to limit the right of conscience or the right to act upon one's conscience is a tyrant, unworthy of the public's trust, and a usurper of rights.

You claim to uphold the right to choose. Dose this right only apply if that choice is sanctioned by the state, and specifically, by you?

Our Constitution was created to protect the rights of individuals,  especially of those without political power. It put limits on the authority of government so those rights would be preserved. 

I have often heard expressed that ""your right to swing your first ends where my nose begins."" While an imperfect saying, this expression symbolizes the idea that no right you possess may infringe upon the rights possessed by another. 

Another expression I have often heard is, ""Keep you laws off my body."" In fact, it has become a political catchphrase for groups such as NOW, which has a huge public relations campaign surrounding this phrase.

Mr. Obama, I urge you to do what is right and to ""Keep your laws off my conscience!"" </i>


President Obama is considering the repeal of protections put in place by former President Bush on the right of conscience for healthcare providers. Given the state of affairs in Illinois, where healthcare workers have been forced to choose between their conscience and their professional licenses - and therefore their ability to earn a living - the issue is more than just a political quarrel. It is a matter of grave import. 

The slippery slope applies here as well. To what other ""procedures"" will this apply? Assisted suicide? Euthanasia? To what other professions will it extend? Must lawyers advocate for social causes which they abhore? 

Ultimately, here is what is at stake: Will powerful politicians dictate what your conscience should be, with the power to take away your livelihood if you do not comply? Taking away the protections now in place would place conscientious objectors at risk.

If you believe in the right to choose, then this is a no-brainer. Why would you offer choice to only those with whom you agree? Why, that would be no choice at all. That would be tyranny."

"event","<i>The idea of government control for the ""common good"" may seem great - until the day the government informs you that you are not common.</i> - Me

Raise your hand if you want someone like George Bush to control your healthcare. Sarah Palin? Mitt Romney? Huckabee? How about Newt Gingrich? 

Don't like that idea? How about Obama? Pelosi? Reed? Tom Daschle? 

If you answered yes to any of those, then I'd wonder why you'd want anyone to control your healthcare other than you and your doctor. 

If you want goverment-payed health insurance then rest assured that someone other than you and your doctor will be making decisions about your healthcare - and ultimately, your health; and you won't even have the choice of switching brands.

One universal truth in politics is that those you like will not always win and someone you don't like will win. When recently challenged by Republicans, Barack Obama's response was a simple ""I won"". 

For those on the right, it was a slap in the face and a sign of Obama's ""bi-partisanship"". 

For those on the left, it was a welcomed slap-down of those on the right and a sign that Obama is no pushover.

Imagine now that the issue at hand is government-run healthcare. Imagine the person you least like has control of both the House and Senate, as well as the office of the President. Imagine this person is doing something that directly affects whether you will receive the healthcare you feel you need. 

You object. They respond with a simple, ""I won"".

Well, I guess in that case ""you lost"" would be just as appropriate a response. 

Already packed into the ""Stimulus Bill"" are provisions for government determining what medical treatments are ""cost-effective"" and ""clinically-effective"". Why make these determinations for the sake of doing it? Rest assured, this is just a first step. Implementing controls based on what someone in government thinks is ""cost-effective"" will come sooner or later, and ""cost-effective"" will be for the ""common good"", your ""right"" to healthcare be damned.

<a href=""http://www.answers.com/communism""><i>Communism: 
1. A theoretical economic system characterized by the collective ownership of property and by the organization of labor for the common advantage of all members.
Communism 
2. A system of government in which the state plans and controls the economy and a single, often authoritarian party holds power, claiming to make progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the people.</i></a>"

"event","I think I've been a little depressed. Between personal circumstances, the economy, and the election I guess I've had reason. 

But I'm trying to rekindle my fighting spirit. So when I went to whitehouse.gov to check out the latest orders and memorandums by Obama, I noticed a public liason thingy where you can type a message for the President. Naturally, I couldn't resist. :o)

I simply tried to remind the President that in forming energy policy we should seek to increase domestic production of oil, gas, and alternatives. The goal should be to make alternative energy cheaper - not fossil fuels more expensive, because the middle class and especially the poor cannot afford the opposite. 

It's small and probably won't even be noticed because honestly, what should he care what I have to say? Well, other than that whole I employ him thing...but I'm just one of, oh, 300 million or so.

I think this liason thing is one thing Obama's doing right because it helps people feel like they can have a voice directly to the administration. Kudos for that. Maybe I can at least vent my feelings on it, even if it's like talking to a wall. I plan to voice support when deserved and dissent when needed.

And you know what they say: <i>Dissent is the highest form of patriotism.</i>

My guess is I'll have a chance soon to feel pretty patriotic, along with the evil el Rushbo and all the house Republicans."

Sadly, they both died way too young.

P.S. It was Confidence Man that Jeff Healey did on Arsenio Hall. If anyone knows where I can find that, I'd be forever grateful. It was the first time I ever saw Jeff Healey. He did Angel Eyes, which I liked, and Confidence Man, which totally blew me away. Best version of it I ever heard. Here's a good version, but nothing like that first time.

"event","the President-elect. America made history by electing the first black President in our history - remarkable for a country that only 43 years ago made good on it's promise of freedom to all with the Voting Rights Act. 

Even in my disgust and anger it was moving to see Jesse Jackson and others choking up over a ""Dream"" that came true - one that they could not have envisioned for their own generation during the struggles of the Civil Right Era. For them, I am happy that they can see an America that has moved beyond race. For my country, I am proud we have done so. 

I am still, however, uneasy with Barack Obama. He is a great speaker. He is a great campaigner. What kind of leader he will be remains to be seen. I truly hope, against my logic, that he will be. 

I will NOT do as many have done in recent years. I will NOT ridicule every move he makes just because he's not the one I voted for. I will NOT oppose him just because I don't agree with him on every issue. When he does well, I will be grateful. When he succeeds, I will succeed, America will succeed. Therefore, I will hope that he succeeds, not in implementing policies that will be bad, but those that will be good for America. But I will oppose him and argue against his policies when they are wrong for America. 

I will not wish him or his family ill health, as so many people have vilely done the last 8 years. If you are one of those people that wished ill health on people like Bush, Cheney, Tony Snow, and others - shame on you. You should pray to your god for forgiveness, apologize, and admit you were wrong, bitter, and that you were, for a moment, overcome by evil hate.

No, I wish Obama and America well. I hope I am wrong about the man. I hope that the minority party uses the filibuster when needed to stop bad policy.  I hope we don't have hard lessons to learn over the next 4 years. 

I am still angry, but I refuse to become bitter. I am worried, but I refuse to despair. I am disappointment, but I refuse to lose hope. 

I've voted in 5 Presidential elections now. This is my first on the losing side. I was never such a big supporter of McCain as I was in opposition to Obama. In that respect, it's not that my man lost, but that the other man won. It's akin to watching another game in my team's conference and hoping that one team loses so that my team will be helped out a little; only it's much bigger, much more important, and much more personal than that. But if my team can't win, I hope my conference does well. If Obama is to be President, I hope he represents America well.

If I seem to be repeating myself, then just consider it a mantra - one repeated in meditation to bring my mind to a higher plane above all the negative feelings that inevitably do harm to the soul.

For those opposed to Obama's candidacy, there is no use in argueing against it now. That die is cast. We should support him when possible and oppose him when we need to do so. We should be gracious in defeat, and tenacious in standing up for right. 

I must close with a prayer, for I pray that I am wrong about Barack Obama. I pray that my disappointment turns to relief, that my grief turns to hope, that my pessimism turns to optimism.  This I pray for myself, for my family, and for my country. So be it."

"event","My father-in-law's funeral was Thursday. Becca and her mother picked out the music with a little help from me. Chester fought in the Korean War. He was awarded a Purple Heart. From what I understand, he drug his wounded buddy out under fire. His buddy didn't make it. I never heard him talk about it, but Becca did once when he had been drinking. I'd like to obtain the citation record for it from the VA. At the funeral, there was an honor guard, 21 gun salute, and full military burial service. It was mt first time hearing a 21 gun salute. It was loud - and very moving.

Becca and her mom have had a hard time with it all. I've been sad myself. Becca's mom came over today and passed ut candy since Halloween was delayed here due to a homecoming football game. Becca looked up icanhascheeseburger and it was really good to see the 2 of them laugh about something and half-way forget their pain for just a few short moments.

Today was my first Saturday off this fall, so I watched a little football. My beloved Crimson Tide remain undefeated and will likely be the new #1 tomorrow. It's about time! But I find myself wishing I could watch a game with Chester and telling myself I need to watch a game soon with my dad, who was born the same year as Chester."

"event","<a href=""http://www.ldsmag.com/ideas/081017light.html"">Orson Scott Card states what I have been thinking a lot lately.</a> I had to edit myself here and replace ""feeling"" with ""thinking"", because what I have been feeling is a visceral and righteous anger, an indignation that cuts to my very soul. I am simply appalled that so-called journalists are not in any way journalists any more. 

For how, with good conscience, can you call yourself a ""journalist"", when you abhore and desecrate <a href=""http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles"">the basic tenets of journalism</a>?

You can read the article for yourself - I won't reprint it here. The contents are mostly about one issue that demonstrates how many ""journalists"" have traded the basic tenets of their profession for something else entirely; but it doesn't end there. Ask yourself, even if you feel that those you support or the ""cause"" that you support has benefitted, this one question: Which matters more, my preferences or the truth?

It appears many ""journalists"" have not asked that question of themselves. Or worse - they asked the question, but chose the wrong answer in their quest for something that can only be done correctly when truth prevails and the loyalties of the journalist are to the citizens they intend to inform. 

Advocacy journalism is not an excuse to abandon the basic tenets of journalism, rather it is using those principles to promote a cause, to the benefit of the people. 

How sad it is that in recent times journalists have failed to adhere to principles <i>or</i> benefit the people.

Frankly, honestly, truthfully - it brings me to the brink of tears."

Widely regarded as <strike>the small screen's</strike> politics' most innovative <strike>sitcom</strike> campaign, the <strike>series</strike> campaign created an unparalleled cache of clever plots, snappy dialogue and crafty characters.

And while the <strike>show's</strike> campaign's innovators would never consider it endearing, it has earned a spot in the hearts of millions, as the mere mention of an <strike>episode</strike> associate or friend will send <strike>fans</strike> spokespeople <strike>reveling in</strike> scrambling for <strike>memories</strike> explanations. 

During its <strike>nine-year network</strike> run, <strike>Seinfeld</strike> Obama, which premiered in <strike>1990</strike> 1995 <strike>on NBC</strike> in domestic terrorists Bill Ayers and Burnedette Dorne's home, set the meandering course for <strike>four single friends living in New York</strike> millions of disaffected voters living America. The group's core is <strike>Jerry (Jerry Seinfeld)</strike> Obama (Barrack Obama), a <strike>stand up comedian</strike> Chicago politician whose professional path includes a shot of <strike>creating a network sitcom</strike> becoming President, a guest spot on the ""Today"" show, and a wealth of other quests gone-awry with a personal life rife with an endless parade of never-quite-right <strike>girlfriends</strike> political bedfellows. His <strike>childhood best friend</strike> pastor of 20 years, <strike>George Costanza (Jason Alexander)</strike> Jeremiah (Jeremiah Wright), could be deemed the quintessential loser; he can never <strike>hold a job or keep a romance</strike> make anyone believe he's not a race-baiter or redeem his character... although he has more than enough schemes to make either happen. <strike>Jerry's ex</strike> Obama's VP choice, <strike>Elaine Benes (Julia Loius-Dreyfus)</strike> Joe (Joe Biden) offers the quirky quartet <strike>her</strike> his own barrage of bad <strike>dates</strike> gaffes and worrisome <strike>workplace sagas</strike> policy positions. The curiously-coiffed <strike>Kramer (Michael Richards)</strike> Bill (William Ayers) rounds up the group as Jerry's over-the-top imaginative and often-mysterious neighbor, who has no visible <strike>means of support</strike> remorse and an uncanny knack for <strike>opening doors to opportunities he has no business being near</strike> escaping proscecution for his communism-inspired terrorist activities. 

The foursome's escapades swiftly segue from the corner <strike>coffee shop</strike> law office to a <strike>Chinese restaurant</strike> 7/11, from the local <strike>movie</strike> 1960's terrorists' house to a <strike>mall parking lot</strike> local park, and from <strike>the car mechanic</strike> board of two ""community projects"" to <strike>a car rental counter</strike> local New Party as their everyday experience subtly set the stage for incisive <strike>humor</strike> dodging about modern <strike>single</strike> socialist life and its assorted in(s)anities in the <strike>big</strike> windy city. 

<strike>Seinfeld</strike> Obama earned a well-deserved reputation for generating water-cooler conversation with brilliantly spun storylines about <strike>Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer</strike> Obama, Jeremiah, Joe, and Bill, oft-repeated <strike>conversation snippets</strike> talking points... unapologetic glee for a revolving lineup of quirky friends, relatives, dates and <strike>urbanities</strike> events. Those colorful characters include <strike>George's</strike> Bill's doomed ex <strike>Susan</strike> Diana Oughton, his petulant <strike>parents Frank (Jerry Stiller) and Estelle (Estelle Harris)</strike> spokespersons David (david Axlerod) and Robert (Robert Gibbs), <strike>Jerry's</strike> Barrack's name-elusive <strike>date Dolores a/k/a ""Mulva,""</strike> mentor and communist poet Frank Marshall a/k/a ""Frank,"" the <strike>Soup</strike> House Nazi, arch-nemesis <strike>date (Wayne Knight)</strike> candidate (John McCain), <strike>""The Bra-less Wonder"" Sue-Ellen Mishkie</strike> ""The Brainless Wonder"" Barney Frank, abrasive <strike>lawyer Jackie Chiles</strike> predecessor John Kerry, ego-driven <strike>catalog magnate J. Peterman (John O'Hurly)</strike> hedge-fund magnate Warren Buffet, and squinty-eyed <strike>Puddy (Patrick Warburton)</strike> Jamess Carville. The <strike>series'</strike> campaign's scenarios have spawned such memories as <strike>puffy shirts, close talkers, big salads, black and white cookies, shrinkage, killer envelopes, masters of their domain, marble ryes,</strike> Hope, Change, erratic behavior, born fetus, not the person I knew, Goddamn America, deregulation, cover-up, white privelege, distraction, and, well, yada, yada, yada. 

During its run, <strike>Seinfeld was</strike> Obama has been honored by more than 20 major <strike>awards and nearly 60 nominations</strike> networks and groups. These include <strike> an Emmy, Golden Globe and three People's Choice Awards for ""Outstanding Comedy Series""</strike> ABC, CBS, CNN, and three NBC networks; <strike>a Screen Actors Guild Awards for ""Outstanding Ensemble in Comedy Series""</strike> Hamas; <strike>two Writers Guild of America, and three Directors Guild of America nods</strike> multiple communist and socialist parties, and Code Pink. <strike>In addition, the series' stars received a multitude of nominations and awards for their individual performances, including Emmys, nine American Comedy Awards, a Golden Globe Award and three SAG trophies.</strike> 

Currently, <strike>Seinfeld</strike> Obama airs in high-profile time periods in leading television stations in more than 200 markets around the U.S., representing more than 99 percent of the viewing audience. <strike>Seinfeld's</strike> Obama's national demographic rating in syndication, particularly among <strike>males</strike> minorities and young adults, have outrated the best of <strike>current broadcast network and cable programs</strike> past Democratic candidates. 

In fact, the <strike>show's</strike> campaign's popularity seems to have an endless reign. <strike>'The Parking Garage' and 'The Boyfriend' were named by TV Guide as two of the greatest episodes in television history , and others including ' The Pez Dispenser' and 'The Contest,' earned spots as two of the funniest moments in TV history</strike>. The characters also keep on resonating with audiences: <strike>George Costanza and Kramer were named by TV Guide as two of TV's greatest</strike> Jeremiah and Bill are ofted named as two of America's lowest characters. <strike>In 2001, a TV Guide cover story detailed that ""It's [been] three years since Seinfeld went off the air (in primetime), and yet the show - in reruns - is still the best comedy on TV."" </strike> In 2008, CNN declared that if you don't vote for obama you must be a racist.

With consistently high ratings, a place in the pantheon of <strike>television classics series</strike> campaigns, and a litany of <strike>Seinfeld</strike> Obama -isms and references still used, millions of viewers still agree: <strike>junior mints and babkas all around</strike> junior terrorists and burkas all round, double dipping into <strike>a Seinfeld episode is never like re-gifting</strike> an economic crisis is never like re-voting."

"event","I thought Palin did well tonight after she shook off the jitters. Biden did what was expected. Palin pretty much held her own against a senior Senator after doing some terrible interviews. She showed a fair amount of competence on the issues, although she too often resorted to rehearsed lines. Still, not too bad. No major screw ups. Biden, however, made several innaccurate statements about McCain's record, and flat out lied about what he said in the rope line about coal. Joe's a smooth talker though. Hopefully, he get called on it.

Bottom line: it's not over. Palin saved herself tonight. The next 4 weeks will be interesting."

"event","OK, let me see if I've got this right...

The current financial meltdown  - caused by a lack of ""liquidity""(basically money, which is a ""liquid"", or easily moved asset) - is being caused by ""toxic assets"" throughout the financial world. Because many banks and others are invested in these ""toxic assets"", they are facing a credit crunch. 

I'll try to understand this by working backwards.

Banks own these ""toxic assets"", which are really Mortgage-backed Securities. These assets are really structured pools of high-risk, but high-yield (when they actually pay out and don't tank) mortgages that were packaged together. They were so bad that no one would trade them without some assurance or quasi-insurance that they'd actually pay and not be a dead-end for investor's money. 

So, the packagers wrapped them up with multiple layers. Tiers 1 and 2 would pay out big; but these high-risk items needed a back-up in case the 1st 2 tiers didn't pay;ie...the mortgages defaulted. Enter the 3rd tier, which would back up the first 2 tiers of high-risk pools or mortgages with a 3rd layer there only for a quasi-insurance quality. But the 3rd tiers were high-risk themselves, thus the whole package was a toxic time bomb that could now receive an investment rating (without this they would be junk bonds - it's exactly like it sounds). With the investment rating these securities could now be sold. 

Remember Enron? It lead to the Sarbanes Oxley Act, which forced companies to use a particular accounting practice called ""Mark-to-Market"". This practice ties the prices of all these assets together, by raising or lowering the book value of all such assets based on the latest of them to be sold.

So when a large firm recently sold a volume of these assets for 22 cents on the dollar, Sarbanes Oxley forced everyone to write down the value of all such assets to 22 cents on the dollar. 

What was a ""private"" sale at a bargain-basement price became an accounting nightmare: hundreds of billions of dollars or more of ""value"" was wiped off the books almost literally overnight when everyone valued all their similar assets at 22 cents on the dollar.

And because of Fed requirements banks now had to put up more capital (read: money) to ""back up"" these assets. 

Thus, banks no longer had much capital (money) to lend. And because everyone is afraid that another ""fire-sale"" will drive these assets even lower in value, no one really knows how to handle all of this.

This is how greed and corruption can fuel a meltdown. How unscrupulous bastards can give capitalism a bad name.

Going back even further, a few other things played into this mess. Remocing barriers erected during the great depression that kept investment, insurance, and banking companies seperate, and Congress forcing banks and especially Fannie and Freddie to make ever-more risky loans to prop up housing markets and home-ownership numbers.

I have no idea really how to fix this, but I think the failed package from Monday was a good measure - in that it failed to pass.

One commentator said that by suspending the ""mark-to-market"" portion of Sarbanes Oxley, that about $500 billion of instant capital(money) would infuse the markets, thereby making loans easier to get.

That still doesn't address the long term problem, if it  even works. 

At some point, it seems to me that these packages have to be unraveled to reveal theor dirty, rotten core so that true value can be placed on each item.

And in case you think these are simple packages easy to understand, supposedly a Cray supercomputer (think global warming models) took 48 hours to figure out the money trail on just one of these toxic packages, from the person paying the mortgage to the bank to the pool through the pool to the investors invested in the pool. Hurricanes take no where near that long to forecast. Unreal, if that account is true.

Secretary of Treasury needs to act now to suspend mark-to-market and institute ""rolling value"" accounting. Bernenke and co. need to cut interest rates 1/2 a point. Today. Congress needs to suspend the corporate gains tax and also allow hundreds of billions of dollars in overseas dollars to be brought bacl home tax free. Today. Sure, the gov. would lose tax money it never had and might never have anyway, given the direction of the markets, but it would provide instant capital liquidity into the market without a dollar from taxpayers and without degrading the value of the dollar by an potentially enormous amount that would further fuel inflation since $1 would buy less food, oil, gas, Euros, Liras, Dinars, or anything else.

AFter that, who knows, but it could be done quickly and perhaps with little resistance. The pot might have to be sweetened a little. 

Encourage companies through tax policies to work out alternate arrangements with those in risk of foreclosure. Perhaps re-financing most or all of the inner pieces of the securities - thereby breaking them apart - would allow real ""estate"" value to be placed where it belongs - on the original loans. Hell, re-finance the whole lot of 'em into 15 or 30 year fixed rate mortgages with low interest rates. Low yield beats high risk now if you ask me."

"event","So I called this am to get an estimate on getting the tree in the back yard cut down or at least the limb hanging out across our neighbor's yard trimmed. Stanley Caffee Tree Service came out. He got out of his truck with 5 other guys. He had just called from McAdory - 30 minutes away - and got out talking about he just cut 13 trees up at the church this morning (as he pointed in a ""that way"" fashion). 

Anyway, he got very high pressure with me, even going so far as to say he had 5 men with him and it costs gas to drive ""all the way down here"". I told him the high pressure was turning me off, thanked him for coming, and started toward the door to come inside when he said, ""Next time don't call someone unless you're serious.""

I replied, ""Well, you don't have to worry about there being a next time.""

A few more words and I was walking to the door again and the crew was loading up in the truck, when I heard, ""...bunch of bullshit...""

I stopped, turned around, and said, ""You need to leave now.""

He got back out around the door, walked to the front of his truck. He tried to look macho and said, ""What did you say?!"" I calmly said I had heard him cussing me and said again he needed to leave, which he finally did.

Crazy, huh?

It gets better (worse). 

That was about 1030-1100 am today. He called tonight at 7:55 (1955 military time) to tell me about the business he did today and that he didn't have time to waste on talking to people. He told me I didn't need to waste people's time. 

I asked why he felt the need to call me, harass me, and waste my time. 

Now here's the kicker. He then said:

""I'm warning you not to be wasting people's time, OK..."" 

Click.

The SOB just hung up!

I just finished filing a police complaint and have a year to swear out a warrant. Unsure of which to do. The guy seems a little unstable."

"event","Being somewhat of a political/history junkie <i>from childhood</i>, I was saddened to learn of the death of Tim Russert of NBC's <i>Meet the Press</i>. Before going back to school a few years ago, and so working most weekends, I would watch the show almost religiously. Even when I was working, I would spend extra time in a patient's room just to hear a few moments of the show.

There was always a sense of urgency and solemness, spirnkled with a bit of humor. There was also the sense that in the end it is people that matter. 

Russert was known for his tough questioning of members of both parties and his solid preparation. He was an old journalist - in the truest sense - in a new world. He didn't let his guests get away with sugar-coated soundbites. He was, like me - and this is why I respected him - a meat-and-potatos man.

He delved beyond the surface of the subjects we see mentioned in a 30 second or 1 minute blurb on the nightly newscasts. He would dig and dig, until he unearthed something that many had seemingly missed. And he wouldn't let politicians forget their past, either. 

when an elite would try to tout the party line flavor of the month, there was Russert displaying their words from a time when a different flavor was in vogue, and for everyone to see. 

Tim Russert made politicians squirm. When they tried to backtrack or rationalize, Russert would let them dig a hole for themselves, then for good measure hit them with the proverbial shovel. 

But he wasn't so much a ""gotcha"" kind of guy as he was the kind of guy that held our leaders' feet to the fire on issues such as taxes, war, government reform, foreign policy, and political in-fighting. 

Unfortunately, Tim Russert's breed is far too few in numbers today. We are seeing the rise of people like Chris Matthews, Bill O'Reilley, and Keith Olbermann, whose every word, every question, every insinuation - not just in their commentary, but throughout their show - is peppered with their own bias.

Russert stood out from this group because most times it was hard to discern just where he stood on the issue. He also stood out because it wasn't about his ego or self-aggrandizement. He wasn't more important than the story, and he understood that. The man was truly humble. He understood that the People didn't want him so much as they wanted him to do the job that he did.

I hope someone more like him will step out now that he is gone, but until then - even then - Tim Russert will be sorely missed."

"event","Normally, when speaking of politics here (and elsewhere) I tend to limit myself to criticising some policy or suggested policy. Here I offer some actual suggestions myself.

First, the very definition of a tax is that it is a burden. In most instances, we speak of a tax as a financial burden. 

On a side note, in order to qualify for home health care with Medicare/Medicaid leaving your home must be a ""taxing effort"", meaning burdensome on you physically or psychologically. It must be draining to leave home so much that you rarely do so.

So, we have established laborously what everyone already knows: taxes cause a financial burden on those who pay them.

We also know that the stronger you are, the less a burden on you it is to do some activity. And so it is with taxes. The stronger you are financially, the less a burden it is on you to pay taxes. Inversely, the weaker you are, the more the burden.

So, instead of just reciting what is wrong with our current income tax system, I will propose some changes to it should it continue to exist (and it will). 

First, the poorest should not have to pay income taxes, so the first $20,000 (or about) for singles and the first $35,000 (or about) for couples should be completely exempt from income taxes. For each child, add an exemption of about $5-10k. All income above this would be taxable. The rate would be graduated. Like it is now, the more you make the more you can afford to pay because you are less burdened by it. The top rate would be no more than 25%. 

I have no studies to back this up, but I think something like this could be done, give the middle class a tax break, and most likely be revenue neutral.

Of course, the other side of this equation is spending. One problem with government spending is inefficiency. Much of that inefficiency is found in the state's administration of programs such as food stamps, medicaid, and the like. Instead of 20 agencies with 20 buildings and 20 administrators, why not streamline these programs? Why not put them under one roof? Have 1 administrator with department heads? Have 1 database to maintain? In other words, why not learn from the private sector? 

Put an end to earmarks in bills. Stop wasteful and unnecessary spending. 

We must balance the budget. 

Well, there's a few ideas. Can't say they're any worse than what we have now."

"event","Tonight there is no doubt that Barack Obama will be the Democrat nominee for President of the United States of America.

This is nothing short of phenominal. A black, African-American, mixed-race man, for the first time in history, in a land that enslaved black people until the 1860's, in a land where only 40 some-odd years ago refused to recognize the equality of black people and denied them opportunities on every front - educational, economic, and political - in that land - this land - a black man, a man of mixed racial heritage will be the nominee of 1 of the 2 major political parties. 

Whatever else may be the case, that fact is historic. 

Watching tonight I was reminded of moments in history that stand out many years later - the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Iron Curtain, the assassination of Martin Luther King. How do these relate? Some are certainly bigger players on the international stage. But in some ways this is like the Berlin Wall falling and millions of people, literally overnight, being free to pass beyond a border that should have never been. A regime of illegitimate power was overpowered. What a contrast to the haunting death of Dr. King. Now instead of Americans asking themselves ""What would have been? What could have been?"", we can now ask ""What will be?"" and we can be proud that we have come so far, even though it has taken so long.

Even though I have heard him before, I was still taken aback by the oratory skill of Barack obama. His words actually, and honestly, stirred me. He is good with words. He has a cadence, a rhythm, a treble and tenor that is uplifting. In some ways I was reminded of ""The Great Communicator"", Ronald Reagan. I felt like i was hearing someone that could lift the country's spirits and comfort the nation in a time of national tragedy, much like Reagan did after the Challenger disaster, or that Roosevelt did after Pearl Harbor.

The truth is, I was torn between inspiration and desperation. Inspired that a man of color with African heritage stands at the doorstep of the White House. Despaired that this particular man and his agenda has made it this far. 

Inspired that a man who, at the outset of American history would not have been considered a person or deserving of rights, is a strong candidate for President. 

Despaired that such a man does not consider an unborn baby <i>at full term</i> or even a baby <i>delivered into the world alive</i> in a botched abortion to be a person or deserving of rights.

Barack Obama is a great orator like many throughout history. I imagine Jesus was a great inspiring speaker. His followers were certainly enthused. Roosevelt, JFK, and Reagan were masters of language. But so, too, did Hitler and Stalin master the art of speech. This gift is neither good nor bad, but can be used for either. I do not see Obama as a Hitler or Stalin, but neither do I see him as a Jesus Christ, or even as a JFK or Ronald Reagan. He stands as a unique man in his own right.

Obama's speech is smooth and soothing, but his history and associations are troubling, as are his policy positions. 

He speaks of greater opportunity, but has plans that through higher taxes would harm companies that provide millions of jobs.

He speaks of free healthcare, but ignores the enormous burden of costs - both economic and in liberty - that his plan would bring to bear on the American public.

He speaks of energy independence in the future, but is unwilling to allow oil exploration and drilling to help us edge closer to that reality now. 

He speaks of the burden of ""failed economic policies"" and higher food and fuel prices while still supporting ethanol mandates that raise the price of both and continuing to tout a ""carbon tax"" that without doubt would raise those prices even more for the poorest Americans.

And I really hate to bring this up, but he speaks of uniting America while for 20 years and until recently attending a church full of divisive ideas, and counting as ""close, spiritual advisors"" those who spew such divisive drivel until political expedience demands he put them at arm's length and while still refusing to denounce these ideas, men, and words fully. 

And tonight he spoke out of both sides of his mouth concerning Iraq. 

And no, I will NOT be supporting John McCain or voting for him for President. for he, too, is a man long on words but short on action. John McCain has trampled on one of the most sacred on American rights - human rights - that of political free speech. He supports similar ""carbon tax"" policies that would hurt poor Americans and opposes developing our own natural resources. 

No, this is the year I vote in protest, futility be damned. This is the year I vote on principle, not on pragmatism. This is the year I ""throw my vote away"", but throw it in the direction of my own choosing. This is the year I hope for a new day and that the night before it comes is not too long.

*Edit:

Obama's associations with controversial people from within his church and without are a concern, no matter what media pundits say. Why? They indicate the type of people he would surround himself with as President. People who would have influence on the highest office in the land and its policies. People not only like his former pastor, but some who are active members of the Nation of Islam - the problem with which is its black separatist doctrine, not to mention anti-jewish venom."

"event","You've seen the reports by now of yet another pastor at Barack Obama's church spewing racially charged <a href=""http://www.answers.com/vitriol&r=67"">vitriol</a> from the pulpit. 

It was suspect, at the very least, when Rev. Wright's comments came to light that in 20 yrs of membership in the church and during a long personal friendship with the Rev. Wright, whom Obama called a spiritual mentor and advisor, that Obama has never heard the kinds of remarks that have drawn so much attention. Then when Rev. Wright steps down, Rev. Moss steps up with similar remarks. And now we have Father Pflegler doing the same.

One thing to be noted is the crowd's raucus response each time during these remarks. There's nothing to make you think anyone disapproves at all. 

I don't presume to know the anger and frustration some black people (or insert the prefered descriptive phrase) feel. Too many are in poverty, lack strong families, and truly do have the cards stacked against them. 

That is still no excuse for a man who says he's trying to bridge the racial divide to associate with - indeed, to count as spiritual advisors - people who espouse such views. It undermines his supposed agenda. It calls into question - and perhaps impugns completely - his claims of a racial ""healer"".

And IF his is a false persona, just what else about the man is false?

And that is well before we get into a discussion of his known agenda. 

I know this is a sensitive subject, but I just find Sen. Obama's handling of the matter to be <a href=""http://www.answers.com/disingenuous&r=67"">disingenuous</a>. For him to pretend not to know anything about these people is beyond the credible. His disavowment of them seems only for political expendience.

In order to believe otherwise, you'd have to believe Barack Obama is even more aloof than Pres. Bush."

"event","Global Warming, or climate change, is in the news every day. Everything from the ailing economy to hurricane deaths are reported to be due to global warming. Here's what I think:

1. When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and caused terrible death and destruction, global warming was touted as a specific cause for a ""Cat 5"" hurricane that killed and destroyed. The reality is that Katrina was a strong Cat 3 when it made landfall near New Orleans. The reason the levees were over run and many people died was poor construction and maintenance of the levees. The danger of Global Warming Hysteria in this case is that we may not learn all the lessons to prevent future loss of life by simply blaming climate change.

The same thing is true of the recent cyclone is Myanmar. This was a strong cyclone, yes, but most of those killed lived in low-lying coastal regions and received NO WARNING of the impending storm. Additionally, the government there has bungled the relief effort.

In both of these instances, climate change was not to blame for the deaths that took place. It was often government bungling and lack of preparation that was to blame. Shifting the blame onto a ""too big to solve"" problem absolves those responsible of their responsibility and causes many to ignore problems that are easily solved and are KNOWN to save lives.

2. Right now there are many, including all 3 candidates for President, who advocate reducing CO2 emissions. There is only one way to do this without going totally nuclear (as in nuclear power) and totally plug-in electric car with electricity fueled by those nuke power plants: cause a recession - and economic downturn. High fuel prices, inflation, higher taxes - all these things reduce the capacity for economic growth by forcing us to ""change behaviors"" - like stop spending money on extras that we now have to spend on neccessities. In the future, it may very well be possible to reduce pollution through new technologies and innovations. 

And by pollution, I don't mean CO2, unless you consider you own body to be a polluter of the environment just by continued breathing. George Micheal said it best: ""(CO2) in natural, (CO2) is fun, CO2 is best when it's one(carbon) on one(dioxide molecule).""

HAHA, I totally made that up. ;)

The economic problem comes from the fact that the people to be most affected (and effected) by bad policies that stump economic growth and even reverse it, are the poor. Not just here in the good old USA, but all around the world. 

As fuel and food prices rise, most American families will be able to absorb most of the costs - even poor families. The government will likely even help out through the foodstamp program and LIHEAP and others. But what about poor people in other countries, where the term ""poor"" has a totally different meaning than not being able to afford cable TV or high-speed internet access. No, being poor in many parts of the world means not being able to afford food, clothing, shelter, or heat. As we make them even poorer, they don't cancel their HBO or Earthlink subscriptions, they die. 

Is this why Obama wants the US to start a worldwide welfare program?

Is this the real and present danger McCain thinks we should tackle?

But alas, the pitiful state of the American Presidential race is for another time. 

For anyone who really cares about this subject, may I recommend that you do not rely on ""news"" stories from ""journalists"" on this issue? No, my friend, do your own research on the matter. Find out for yourself if any ""credible"" scientists with real credentials are ""skeptics"" on the issue. Look beyond the hype of the ad hominem attacks and the alarmist language. 

Most of all, keep an open mind and remember that if the debate were truly over, no one would have to keep telling the lie that the debate is over, over and over."

BTW, NASA now says that global warming will be masked by a natural cycle of global cooling until 2015 - something previous climate models failed to predict, much like the flat to cooling trend from 1998-present - and then the warming will be ""visible"" again. 

Fear not, though - or rather be very afraid - because global warming is still happening <i>even while the earth is cooling</i>!!! 

Why didn't previous supercomputer models predict the current trend? Why did the models predict the cooling trend to 2015? The models left out many climate variables. That's why. What other variables are being left out still, and why should we believe supercomputer generated climate models which are created by human input - garbage in, garbage out - that have failed to accurately predict even past events that are well known, much less believe they can predict the future? I mean, they can't get the forecast for next week right and we think they can predict accurately for 100 years?! 

I'm all for lowering pollution levels. Let's do what we can in that respect. CO2 is not pollution, though. CO2 is a vital part of the atmosphere and has a a nonlinear greenhouse effect - with greater and greater concentrations of CO2 the greenhouse effect it produces grows less and less."

"event","I recently signed up the family to take part in the AGRE (pronounced ""agree"") program. It is a repository of genetic material taken from families with 2 or more children that have autism. it does not research, but participates in genetic research on autism by providing the genes needed in the research, and since it is centralized if 2 or more studies use the same people's genes, then that can be accounted for when meta-analyses of such research are done.

I thought it was a great idea. Maybe my family holds the key to a cure! Cool!

Then, almost as an afterthought, I wondered something that had not entered my mind previously: What if they <i>do</i> find the genes responsible? How long before a ""cure""? And what do we do between the finding and the ""cure""?

Then I thought about Down Syndrome babies - or rather the lack of them.

Yes, many people abort their child when they discover he/she has chromosome 21 trisomy. In fact, some estimates of the % of Down babies aborted are as high as <i>90-93%</i>!

Much of the problem is ignorance. Down's doesn't mean automatic institutionalism anymore. Or death by age 30. a href=""http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060907/TMAG01/60901002/1138"">John Mark Stallings</a>, son of Coach Gene Stalling, is an inspiration, not a drain on society or a curse upon his parents.

People like Johnn Mark enrich people's lives, but many of them literally never live to see the light of day - not a single one.

So the debate in my head now, after speaking with the contact from AGRE who said about my concern when I mentioned it as a reason for me to be hesitant, "" Well, that's not our intent, but if it is used that way then that is a very personal choice between a woman and her doctor."" - well, the debate is: should we or shouldn't we?

Idealism says yes, we should help with an effective treatment. Idealism also says no, we should be who we are.

Human nature is a curious thing. We strive for life. We would kill to maintain it. Or to protect our children. 

The sad thing is that we sometimes kill our children to maintain our comfortable lifestyle.

Would that happen to autistic kids like mine if we ""agree"" to participate in AGRE?"

"event","It's hard sometimes, having 3 kids with ASD.

Wednesday was Jacob's IEP meeting. Unlike last time, this one was actually run quite professionally and was therefore much more productive. While the idiot that ran the last show sat at a different table and mused that maybe ""just the praents"" could take J to tour his new middle school and help him learn his way around - to which I answered rather incredulously that we'd be just as lost as him - we actually made progress this time. 

It wasn't all easy. Actually, we didn't finish it. That's not a reflection of how little got accomplished Wednesday, but rather of how much had not been accomplished to that point. 

This time we actually addressed his acedemic needs, as opposed to only ""disruptive"" behaviors. 

Jacob has a hard time writing. I worked with him an hour one night to help him write the answer to ""What is your favorite color and why?"" One hour. One blank page. Much upsettedness. He couldn't ""lie"" and say something was his favorite if it wasn't or ""lie"" about the reasons he liked that color. Oh, boy.

So, the rep from middle school stated an appropriate ""goal"" would be for J to turn in 3/5 writing assignments and for this to be used as his grade. I had to relay the ""favorite color"" story and ask how, if he can't even start an assignment, how could he finish and turn one in for a grade? What supports, strategies, and interventions do we need in order to <b>teach him</b> <i>how</i> to write? i said that I didn't just want him to coast through with lowered standards, but I want him to <b>learn</b> so he can be a productive member of society. Lowering the standard without helping him learn does not accomplish this. Amid some puzzled looks, there was also a flurry of activity over this ""novel""(in quotes because it's not, nor should it be) idea.

Different problem in math. The kid that multiplied - in his head - 50X8000 and came up with the right answer (this in <i>first grade</i>) can't now write out how he gets the right answer. Problem, answer. Nothing in between. Like English, he understands the language of math well, but has problems writing it out. I said this needs both accomodation and the proper SSI's(supports, strategies, and interventions) to help him along. Same reaction.

Another area was accomodation in instructions. J doesn't get metaphor. You most certainly are NOT pulling his leg, even if you say you are! So asking him ""What is the <i>right</i> main idea"" of the passage he just read is met with the following response: There is no ""right"" main idea. Right and wrong is a matter of opinion. Wow. :o)

The place I had the most difficulty getting something included in the IEP was the area of bullying/disability harassment. ""We can't include behaviors for other kids in his IEP. It has to be about J."" ""Well then, "" I said,"" We can start by putting in place the appropriate supervision in places bullying in known to happen or be likely to happen. Then, we can instruct J to report it when it occurs and have him reporting it each time as a goal."" 

After an awkward ""Eurika"" moment pause, my insistence and ""creativity"" paid off. ""They"" had listened. ""They"" seemed to get it. 

But ""they"" are teachers, and ""they"" should have gotten it right away. Still, progress is slow. 

We will need to meet again as 1 hour and 45 minutes wasn't enough time. We didn't even get to his behavioral goals. Making your case takes time."

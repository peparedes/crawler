"event","I think my facination with garbage men began when I saw a ""Picture Picture"" production on Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.  You know how you'd look at the painting on the wall and it would become a TV.  Anyway, this really left an impression on me.  
Every Wednesday morning in the summer I would wake up to the sounds of screeching brakes followed by a roaring acceleration drawing nearer and nearer by the minute.  Then my brother and I would race outside and wave until there wasn't a visible trace left of the truck or last week's garbage.  
Now when it's approach wakes me up, I think what an awful sound that mass of metal and stink makes.  I've decided that these men and their trucks of revulsion are in fact mystical.  Because I've never run across evidence of ""garbage men"" ever existing. A person has yet come forward and put to rest the myth of the garbage man.  
Until then, to all the garbage men, I still wave to you as you rumble off into the morning fog."

"event","ok.  So selfish people suck, and I'm going to try everyday of my life to not be one.  That is what I learned from my heart demolition.  enlightenment you may not desire, but enlightenment is what you are going to get.  

I understand honesty, even brutal honesty.  I am even agreeable to the nature of the honest words.  I do not, however, understand the portrayal of an act so cloaked in selfishness that it is almost unrecognizable to the one committing the act.  It goes beyond caring for or loving another.  It's a matter of basic morality, humanity, empathy, and compassion.  i'm thankful that I now recognize a lack of these traits, for what a huge mistake was in store.  It is so unfortunate that these acts happen.  We who are truly naive and trusting, those who represent love and give it so freely to those we feel deserving, we are broke, taken advantage of, and deprived of our last innocent breath because we gave it away to someone whom we thought needed it more than we did.  

I became afraid the other day after reading a chapter of Revelations.  Would I be deserving if the seventh angel poured the contents of his bowl onto us tomorrow?  or would I be left behind?  I know that I would be taken.  But what of those who are clothed in their selfishness, no matter how invisible the garments are to them?  those whose acts on others are devoid of the afore mentioned characteristics, and treat others how they were once treated fully knowledgeable of the pain it creates.  No, I don't think they would be saved.  Not until they fully understand the impact of their actions and are truly remorseful.  I am so glad that I am not one of those people.  And I'm so glad that I'm not dating one anymore."

"event","a cluster headache is one that centers around one or both eyes.  Medically speaking, it is classified as easily becoming more painful than migraines, causes sensitivity to light and sound and nausea/vomiting.  I get these usually once a week but never so intense as today.  Sitting in writing class my left temple began pulsating a sharp pain that continued completely around my left eye.  I couldn't open my eye because the light hurt so badly, so I sat there rubbing my eyebrow with my closed eye tearing.  I was so uncomfortable despite 200 mg of advil that i couldn't think straight.  I had to stay in class though since he was going over the assigned essay due next week.  All I could envision was that dwarf from lord of the rings crashing a large wooden mallet onto a large wooden spike that was positioned over my temple.  i left about a half hour early when he announced it was time to get into groups which takes much much patience from me.  (patience has a way of escaping me in times of blinding pain.)

also, when experiencing a headache of this magnitude, i decided that the girl walking behind me in flip flops had two choices  (1.) pick her freaking feet up when she walked! or (2.) watch me rip them off her feet and chuck them onto the roof of GVT.  

possibly alcohol could fix this problem in the future, as a weekend of nightly pass outs seemingly corrected my chronic back pain.

"event","ughhh.  I thought I was sick yesterday!  Today's development of a cough has blessed me with a continuous burning in my chest.  I've decided that I'm dying.  comforting?  who knows.  I really want a cigarette.

a little praise-worthy news, my budget worked!!!  It was so exciting to actually have a cushion again and no negative signs on my bank statement.  This has convinced me that I can achieve anything I set my mind to.  


I've been an ass lately.  I've been so dramatic lately.  (Granted I've been sick as hell, drunk, menstruating, sleep deprived, nutrients-lacking, and so stressed that I developed an eye tick. Not excuses, I know, but even the most perfect of us need a break once in a while!) This drama emergence is confusing to me because I'm usually not ruffled by the things that have done so.  
   
I'm afraid of mediocrity.  I'm afraid of never attaining what I desire.  The last couple days have proven that drama is not the way to deal with fear.  Drama alienates.  Drama annoys.  Drama is such a worthless form of communication.  Drama instills a feeling of clawing for solid ground, only to erode away what is existing. I wish it were not so hard to identify while immersed.  Just when I think emotions are in check, a different fuel blows on the coals.  Trials and tribulations, my dear.  Tomorrow is always there to give one the chance to start new and self improve.  that's what I've set my mind to for tomorrow.


as for tonight, a friend is bringing over some homemade Thai broth (yum!)and some cough syrup (yuck).  I think they're bringing some movies too.  I need a nice evening to rest-up and de-stress myself.  I think a bubble bath might be in the works as well."

"event","so my first of today's two dates was canceled. (haha apparently hanging out with Todd is a date) :c( I was disappointed because I really really wanted to ride on a motorcycle and on a boat too.  But another time will come.  I needed to run errands anyway.  

I went to go buy rollerblades, but the place was closed because the guys went on a ""mini vacation.""  I'm going to start rollerblading a) to get my hips/butt/thighs sexified and b) so I can eat whenever/whatever I want without worrying about getting fat.  it's probably good for my heart too.  yay

um the photo shoot pictures are up. However, with sobriety comes a sense of logic and/or tactfulness...yea, I don't really think I want these pictures available to everyone in the world to see.  So I think I'll just show them to who I want to.

until next time

p.s. you know you're getting close to your period when:
you walk down the greeting card aisle at Walfart, pick up the first birthday card for your mom that catches your eye, open and read the simple message, and immediately tear up."

all your life you've been taught something, but you never really understood it.  No one took the time to define it in terms you could grasp.  when you start to learn how you fit into this world, you drop that teaching since it never really meant anything to you anyway.  so you go on, but you're feeling like you're running on fumes and not a gas station in sight.  You see how someone else has turned that pile of confusion that you rejected into a definitive part of their life.  You think, how admirable, and wish that you could have benefited, and then maybe you wouldn't feel so empty."

"event","I open my eyes and instantly am power-bombed by the daylight's reality.  Violently swimming in my head are an acidic mixture of plaguing questions and silent emotions.  I am stuck.  To move wholeheartedly forward is not allowed because I do not know how.  I desire to experience life outside of the shadow that I clutch.  So I wake up and begin once again to mercifully analyze myself.

Cloning is the answer.  Is there a more perfect way to be immersed in self-analysis?  Oh to be relieved from my cliched transitional angst and evaluate from an external position.  Who?  What caused me to drown in the sun's penetrating rays?  Did these daily ulcer-inducing anxieties result from my fear, abuse, love, neglect, confusion as a child?

I would nurture my clone.  My perfectionism would no longer be a hindrance; only a tool.  She would have everything I longed for and be stripped of the hardships that tore away my innocence.  Will she turn out like me?  Of course not.  The deprivation and obstacles make me who I am.  

How would she feel when she is pulled from her secure unconsciousness to face the unforgiving sun?  She is the biggest insight into myself.  I can only hope to one day wake and feel calmed by what I've learned from her.

"event","I've just finished reading an article about CR (caloric restriction).  Tests are still pending, but researchers are theorizing a 30% addition to our life span beyond the normal maximum.  Those who have become devoted to this extreme lifestyle change have boasted such benefits as lower blood pressure and cholesterol which decrease risks for heart disease (America's leading killer).  Also,  a drop in blood sugar and an increase in insulin sensitivity lower risk of diabetes.  
   How intense is this caloric restriction?  So much so that one's ability to perform aerobic exercise is very limited because energy-saturated calories are reduced to about 1,500 a day.  Exercise is evil anyway.  The two molecules we need to survive, oxygen and glucose, end up poisoning us in the end.  Aerobic exercise, by boosting metabolism, accelerates the aging process.  As one CR advocate put it, ""Think of it [exercise] as god offering you two extra years of life, provided that you spend them jogging.""

So do i eat or not?  exercise?  I am so confused.  What do you want from me, cruel cruel world?  Honestly, i think that the space swallowed up by this article should have been granted to one promoting self-worth and acceptance.  

wait.  an excuse to be lazy?  I think i've found my niche."

so here's where my idea of becoming a international jewel thief comes into play... HOTT!"

"event","guys, please do not recite your shitty poetry to girls whom you are trying to impress while sitting up at a bar.  no matter how drunk both parties are, your poetry is still shitty.  

this guy was sooooooooooo annoying.  5 seconds in, i knew i wanted out.  i also thought to myself, 'how can a person be so irritating??'  and 'maybe he'll stop breathing mid sentence.'
in this afore mentioned poem, he ""walked down a street.  and then fell down a sewer because the lid wasn't on.  brushed himself off, hosed himself down. and continued walking.""  he fell down the sewer,brushed and hosed FOUR MORE TIMES, until finally he proceeded down a different street which had the sewer lids on...and ""that was god's street.""  i thought he was trying to be funny.  this coming from someone who understands and appreciates every individual's art.  but COME ON!!!!!  

i was finally rid of this aggravating presence by telling him to play jimi's foxy lady on the juke box, and when he walked away, i laughed because there wasn't a jukebox.  when he returned with a confused and annoyed look upon his face, a friend of mine had replaced his seat at my request.  

why?"

"event","some things I love and can't wait to do once summer arrives...

riding my bike, grilling out, playing catch, taking the dogs to the park, hiking, going on a picnic, walking the dogs, laying in the sun, drinking cold beer on our deck on a clear starry night, camping, listening to the crickets while i go to sleep, opening my windows, smelling summer smells, wearing summer clothes and flip flops, enjoying longer days, participating in summer flings, being slightly scared but pleasured by night-time thunderstorms, driving with the windows down, attending baseball games, eating ripe summer fruit such as strawberries and watermelon, dozing in the hammock, witnessing all the colorful and fragrant flowers, and finally experiencing WARM weather!  


please add to my compilation by commenting which summer activities YOU are anticipating."

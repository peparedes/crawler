"event","Uhh what did I do today?...Oh yeah!
I got up and hung out with Lilly. We watched Stanley, Rolie Poli Olie, and Lazy Town. Wow that was way too entertaining. Except Lazy Town is such a gay show...it's a combination of cartoons and real people...kinda weird. Then I watched Lilly some more and was really bored. I found some stuff from World War II for Aundi cause IEw then I had to go to church, how boring! Talked to Aundi on the phone from 8 til 12, we wouldn't have gotten off if my faggot phone didn't run out of battery. I've been having problems with electronics lately. Computers and phones...urgh!

Melinas birthday and Valentines day are oh so close!!!"

So I'm watching Lilly and yeah whatever that's fine. And then when I try to get her to go to bed she won't and so my mom takes her in her room and blah blah blah.

I was outside shoveling my driveway with my dad cause our fucking snow blower broke. Then one of my neighbors comes and parks in front of our house and asks if we want him to plow our yard. He saved me from shoveling the whole god damn thing. I absolutly love nice neighbors but some of them are faggots like Mike.
My sister came over to drop off Lilly for the weekend cause she's going skiing, the lucky turd that she is. And she paid me for babysitting. Do you know how long it's been since I had my own money? My parents always give me money for stuff but now I have my own money to spend on whatever the hell I want. I feel so special. lol
Hopefully I'll have a good rest of the day...but we'll see.

I LOVE NEIGHBORS AND SISTERS!"

Too bad I probably won't get my lazy ass out of bed to help. lol Yup that's right as I'm typing this I'm sitting in my bed with a bunch of food around me.

Then on Monday...all I remember is falling on the ground in the great room and Melina hitting her head on the cement...and I guess we were really hyper but man I really don't remember...all Melina knows is that she woke up and had no voice hmm werd...and also that night we made the GREAT CONFESSION...stealing Thomas's shoe and then signing it...dude what were we thinking when we took that shoe oh wait we weren't
Then today was a shitty day a very shitty day...found out some bad news, got so fucking pissed at Sarah's bf (my neighbor)...sat through classes...got bored...was almost left in the library...Melina and I got complimented for being good in math class!!!!! yes as you can kinda figure out that was a first that I thought was never going to happen...and that was about it for my shitty day...but that weekend was DANDY!"

It was horrible and then Melina tried to wipe it off and it smudged all over the place. She's such a sped but I love her. So now the front of my shoe is all pink!
Then after school I went to the movies with Pat. That was quite fun!
Today I brought Lilly home then went out to lunch with my parentals. That wasn't too bad. Ew then I had to go to church...I don't even see the point to going to church, it's so gay. And now I'm talking to the one and only Aundi on the phone, like usual.

But from reading I got wicked tired and thought I was going to fall asleep during that gay bio ethics debate that we had to go to.
I think I failed the french test today and I was informed that as of now I'm getting a 36 in that class. Urgh school is so stressful!
Haha it was the funniest thing in Science class today. Zoe asked Mr. Rioux if she could borrow his Darwin awards book and he said no and she goes But your coming over tonight. ahahahahahahaha That had to have been the second funniest thing EVER! The first was the S&M thing.

Melina and I went to the library after school. Wow we are so ADDish. We sat down to do notes for history and about a minute later we were up wandering around the library. We just couldn't sit still. Then we thought the library was closed and they forgot to tell us to leave. So we thought the alarm was going to go off when we left. ahaha That sure was a funny one...you wouldn't appreciate it as much as us speds do.

This morning I got up and went to school.
First period - Math
It was boring like usual and I didn't learn anything. I got yelled at a lot, Mr. Brennan made me move cause I was talking to Sara and Melina. Oops!
Second period - English
We had some grammar test and I got a 76. Urgh I'm so pissed off about that because I thought I knew everything so I didn't study. During English I called my mom and asked her if she could come pick me up cause I didn't feel good.
Third period - History
I only stayed for about 15 minutes of history because my mom came and picked me up.
Then my dearest mother, my father, and I went to the mall and I got the pimpest Etnies ever. I went to Abercrombie and got a new pair of pants and a cute shirt.
After we went out for lunch, it was interesting. We sat across from this group of old people who were really loud and obnoxious. They kept yelling to their friends at the other table and blowing their noses, coughing, and sneezing. It was absolutely disgusting! I deffinatly lost my appetite and didn't eat. I think there should be a separate section for old people. lol
Then we went to the car wash and we were waiting in line and some effing car got stuck in the car wash. It was the funniest thing ever...so we left and went to another car wash. I have an obsession with going through car washes and the one we went to was the COOLEST car wash EVER!
Then we came home and here I am sitting here, updating my livejournal and waiting for everyone to get home from school.

Then my mother asked me if I wanted to go shopping for some new shoes so of course I said yeah but then I changed my mind because I really didn't want to get out of my pj's. I'm such a lazy ass but at least I went online and found the shoes that I want. They are the coolest shoes in the world! They're Etnies and the E thing is leopard print and fuzzy and so is the back. They are the bomb diggity! I also talked to the awesome Aundi and we called Pat but he had to go. That was depressing. And I talked to Sara about our problems which we have way too many of. And now I'm really bored and have nothing at all to do. Urgh I'm kinda pissed off at a few people...well before I start going on a tantrum about how I hate people, I'm gonna go now!

Then I went home with Sarah and we hung out and went online and stuff. Then had a really fun conversation about boys.

This morning we got up really early and went ICE FISHING!!! That was kinda fun...we were stupid and Sarah wore clogs and I wore sneakers so our feet were really really cold. We just kinda hung out in the little hut thing and warmed our feet and read Romeo and Juilet (don't ask). Then we left and I kinda got us lost on the way home but eventually we made it to my house. Then Sarah went home and now I'm on the phone with Aundi, babysitting Lilly, and watching the ARISTOCATS!! Wow I am just such a cool kid! Alright I'm gonna go now and talk to my dearest Aundi.

"event","Hey everyone...
I got a new layout and everything and deleted all my old updates. I'm starting all over. Hopefully this time I won't get bored of it and stop updating. 

Well today was an ok day.
First period - Math
We went over some problem set and did boring math. I just sat there and talked to people and passed notes. I never pay attention in math, maybe that's why I always get yelled at.
Second period - History
We talked about our Research Project which is really complicated for a simple mind like mine. I couldn't think of anything to do so I had to go to Pat and Aundi for some help. Thanks so much guys! You helped me a ton!
Third period - English
Had a vocab and spelling test that I probably failed because I didn't study. We got our essays back and I guess you can say I was satisfied with my grade. Then we got a new thing to write...some family story. Ahh so gay!
Fourth period - French
We taked about some gay story thing we're reading. I don't understand it at all, it just doesn't make any sense. And we have a test on that Tuesday...oh great! The funniest part was when Sara and I were staring out the window watching the people knock icicles off the roof and Ms. Zurawel goes ""Sara, I don't think you need to pay attention to them, that's not going to be on the test"" Wow that cracked me up for no apparent reason. I love how Ms. Zurawel always yells at Sara, it's too funny.
Fifth period - Science
All I remember was we were talking about HIV and AIDs and Melina was telling me about some incest story in our book. OH! Then Melina deffinatly made a funny...Melina and I were sitting next to each other like usual and Martin was sitting next to me. Me and Melina, the pigs that we are, we're eating some food substance lol when Martin asks if he can have some. And Melina goes ""Can't you see the sign, It says don't feed the animals!"" I guess you had to be there but it was the funniest thing ever.
Lunch
During lunch Melina and I wondered around and then went back the Middle School cause her advisor group was having a party. I kinda stole food from them and ate Peanut Butter M&Ms with Melina. It was entertaining.
Then we had advisors and we had the locker decorating thing. It was pretty fun...better than class or advisors. Except our grades decorating job sucked soo bad. O well!
Then sports...I'm still not feeling good so I just went to Sports study hall. Aly, Josh, Paul, Thomas, Sophie, and Julia S. were there. Aly and I passed notes the whole time and I got some homework done. Not much though.
Then I finally got to go home...such a long, cold day at school. Oh and did I mention that it was clash day. That was entertaining.
When I got home I went online and did some homework and got yelled at by my parents. I just kinda went up in my room and blasted my radio really loudly. lol Then I talked on the phone a bit with Sara, Sarah, Pat, and Aundi! My usual, boring, stressful night.

I think I've bored you enough...Toodles!

P.S. I <3 Pat!"

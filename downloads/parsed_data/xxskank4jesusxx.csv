"event","Wow.
So I'm pretty much in love with the song ""Shake"" by YingYang Twins and Pitbull.
I know.
I'm a dork for loving that song.
I also love ""Pump It"" by Black-Eyed Peas.
Although I'm not sure if it's because of the song itself or if it's because it's the theme song of my favorite movie, Pulp Fiction.
That's a dang good movie, btw.
Czech out the myspace at www.myspace.com/pirates_equal_love.
Add me 'cause I'm SWEET!
You know it.
Don't even lie.
It's like 2:00 in the morning and I'm uber tired.
G'night!
&hearts; Jammin' Ska-lest!

"event","Hmm...where was I in my emo-infested story? Oh yeah. So, after the phonecall Sunday, my mom came and got me after Sunday School. She said we needed to go talk to my dad. I told her the whole way there about how I was ready to stop going over there and she said that was fine because it was my choice. We got there and I told my dad how I hated being over there because I don't like how he treats me. Of course he made me feel like an idiot (like always) by saying something smart back. I told him I didn't think I should come over anymore. He basically said he agreed with me and that about killed me. Just knowing that he didn't want me over there. I mean I was expecting him to try and talk me out of it just a little bit...but no. I left crying. My step mom called the next day and said she didn't like my decision and that I should have listened to my dad when he tried to talk me out of it. My mom was like, ""He didn't try to talk her out of it. He agreed to it!"" My dad is such a liar. My step mom told my mom that she should force me to come over. That just shows she wants me to suffer. I mean yeah I'm gonna miss seeing Ciara every other weekend, but I can talk to her on the phone. Honestly, I'd rather not see her than go through that kind of verbal abuse. But get this...my dad called over here Wednesday asking my mom if I could go with him to Marianna Friday night!? My mom told him I had to work on Science fair. When she told me I was like, ""As if!? Does he really think I want to be in a car with him alone for 3 1/2 hours (there and back)?! No freaking way!"" I'm going to Ciara's b-day party Sat. and my dad and step mom would be lucky if I even chose to converse with them! (I know that sounds bad, but if you know my dad, you know what I mean!)
My life is such a soap opera...woah is me!"

"event","So yeah. I'm like uber stressed right now. My real dad and I don't exactly get along...ok...he's always right and harasses me at every turn. (think of Boyd Brown X 10 if you know who that is...) I absolutely hate going to his house, but I can't stand the thought of not seeing Ciara (my little sis) My stepmom isn't exactly the nicest person either. Well, my dad and I got in a nano fight this weekend (it wasn't even like some of the ones we have) Sunday, he called my mom and told her some lie about how I was being disrespectful and what not. I don't know what all they talked about, but they were on the phone for like an hour. gotta get off computer...telll the rest later."

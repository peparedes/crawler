"event","whats with people today, i am starting to see how FAKE
everyone is, even some of my friends seem FAKE now, 
there not really people but shadows of the real. some 
people wish they were dead (which is the stupidest 
thing i have ever heard so far, but i am sure something
will top this.) i can't stand how everyone is TRYING to 
change the way they ACT to fit in(or not to fit in as
some want) most of all i hate how i can see people TRY
to ACT older then they really are. i am starting to 
hate people like james joyce, he goes out of his way 
to try to gain some respect from everyone who is ""cool""
its sooo gay. but that is james i guess... 

ps kira can you ask jon something for me later thanks."

"event","Hello to all. it been a long time since I have posted anything, mostly do to the fact that I have been thinking alot...maybe to much. I guess I start with my weekend thus far

Friday night I want to sears to get some empty box to put stuff in for when we move, but instead of going home after I got the boxes I decide that I was going to hang out in the mall. I thought I was going to be all alone because Scott refuses to go to the mall anymore and Joan works. So I walked walk from sears, stopping at The Picture People store, across from boarders and next to old navy, to see if my friend Stacy was working but sadly I did not find her there. Then I walk across to boarders to see if Jay Jay was working but again I found no one.

So believing I would not find anyone in the mall I knew/liked I just walk aimlessly though the masses of people the came to start X-MAS shopping to beat the rush, the only thing is everyone has the same damn idea and the shopping flooded the mall. Anyway I was walking to the other side of the mall and out of the no where I was Bruce walking towards me. It was a quick hello but it was nice to know I know someone at the mall. 

About 15 seconds later I saw Christie, which totally turn my day around. She gave me a b-day gift which was super nice of her to do. Its been a long time since I got a gift from anyone and its great to know that someones thinking of you. (By the way I can't remember if I said thank you to you Christie so thank you, I love the cd ^_^) 

So now I was no longer alone, we walk towards the food court talking about this and that, sometimes not saying anything, but it was still nice. I don't know how to explain the rested of the night. All I can say it was a nice night. Everything just seem right...mostly. I not sure how many times this happen over the course of 4 hours, but I think she hit her head about 11 times ^_^. At least 5 were my fault but still 11 times it still alot. Come on Christie ^_^. 

Also I saw Jay Jay, Muff, and Mary Ann at the mall at around 8:15 ish. yea i haven't seen muff in a while, he seems to been in good spirits. Well my dear friends I am off for tonight."

Went to play DDR in the Mall. Later
our friends Paul, John, Noah, and
Nina joined use in the DDR festivities.
We must of played for about 4 hours. 
John had a hard time because he gave
blood earlier that day, so he had bad
vision. Oh yes it was grand. Also I
bought a pocket watch."

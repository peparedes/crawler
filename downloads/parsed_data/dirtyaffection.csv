the free ride's over kids (ha, just needed an excuse to tie in that picture of ally and rhys). 

finally got the energy and time i needed to complete my new journal. i'll be adding those of you who i want to keep in my lj life over the next few days so watch your friend list's for a new name. 

those of you who don't get kept, you've been awesome to read about and learn from. thanks for the fun. you can make pleas to be added back -- but i doubt anyone i didn't keep reads my journal often enough to even see this.

i've loved being your <lj user=""dirtyaffection"">, but it's time for a change.

<b>[edit] i've added the last few people. there have been 15 friends in total left behind. take care.</b>"

emily: you sure like sugar, don't you? 
buddy: does syrup have sugar in it? 
emily: yes. 
buddy: then YES! 

buddy: i passed through the seven levels of the candy cane forest, through the sea of swirly twirly gum drops, and then i walked through the lincoln tunnel. 

buddy: i just like to smile! smiling's my favorite.

<u>birthday fest '04</u>

<b>friday:</b> worked until six. went shopping. went to monique's. spent the night at geets with mo, rob, ashley, michelle, alison, allison, erica, carrie, ian, and roxanne. danced, laughed, and mingled. left around 2:30am. grabbed mickey d's. went home. 

<b>saturday:</b> slept. slept. slept. spent the afternoon shopping with carrie. birthday dinner with kate, lauren, lindsay, and jen. they made me stand on my chair while the staff sang, bastards. return home stuffed. ashley picks me up to take me to mo's so we can get ready for the big concert they told me we were going to. turns out they lied about the concert and really were throwing me a <b><u>surprise party</u></b>. i <i>was</i> surprised. spent the night completely stunned by how awesome all my friends are.

<b>sunday:</b> worked until six. learned about some new policies they are enforcing -- definitely helped me realize my time at old navy has expired. went home. showered. spent the night with monique at starbucks and harvey's and then back at her house to watch old episode's of <i>that 70's show</i>.

what can i say? i owe all my friends big time for this birthday. i am the luckiest girl in the 519 area code right now.

good morning victoria!! our first lovely day together.
greg hates driving downtown so we had to take le bus. this is us waiting for its arrival. 
heh, the bus's were a place of good convo's and funny randomness 
they even have doubledecker buses!

me: that was so jesus.
sara: or the lead from nickleback.
me: what if the lead from nickleback is jesus, but he's in disguise?
sara: then he's got a lot of people to smite because a lot of people hate his band.

sara and greg took all their grad photo's there. awe. we went on the perfect day, because the following two days weren't sunny at all.

there was a petting zoo near by, but it was closed for the season. 
but as you can see
that didn't stop me from finding animals to harrass.

me: what's wrong? too damn proud to show your feathers!? i'm never going to see you again you biatch, i wanna see some feather action!!

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v41/cold_kitty/ghettopizza.jpg"" height=""250"" width=""350"">

then they took me to get some ghetto pizza. pizza for a dollar! i had one piece, sara had two, and greg had four. 

greg: that last piece of meat lovers pizza ain't sitting so well.
me: well, considering they can sell you a piece of pizza for 93 cents, i don't want to know where that meat could have came from.
greg: ...please don't bring that to my attention ever again.

haha, victoria surprised me with the fact that there were
three tim hortin's 
but at least 15 starbucks.
usually
it's the other way around. 

so when greg drove sara and i to starbucks before our hiking adventure
i was surprised. 
and told them i didn't think they'd be
'starbucks folk'.

greg responded:
'starbucks, it's not just for assholes'

heh. it made me laugh.

this is us in greg's backseat at greg's place 
picking up his mama and company.
apparently, it was a hiking party. 
we had a big group 7 or 8 of us
and 
one dog. 

yes, i'm smiling now - but i'm not happy. hiking is just not what i do. 

cathrine: we have to remember we're with someone who has never hiked before.

the ortho finally gave me a set date for when i can be seperated from my braces. 
it isn't very long from now.
just a few days over a month. i can make it.

oh, and brennan has been haunting me.
i had a dream about him,
it was weird. 
i told kate about it. she laughed.
then she saw him today
and told him he's being an asshole to me.
he told her he's never gotten any of my calls. 
fascinating new development.

'nothings any good if everyone likes it'

there's a shirt i found on a website that says that. this website also has a shirt that says 'i liked you better before you sold out' which i was planning on buying before i realized i love sell outs. heh. naw, but i'm sure i'm a sell out and i'm not going to give those who think i am ammo. 

<i>i'm getting tired and i need somewhere to begin...</i> 

there's a few shirts at willy's i want very badly. one says <i>it's ok, i'm with the band</i>. it's fun colours and retro looking. then there's another shirt that has a picture of a children's bike on it and it says 'old school'. hot. 

i went downtown looking for aviators because i found a pair that actually looked good on me yesterday at the mall, but they were expensive and i remembered willy's having a 40% off sale so i thought maybe i'd get lucky. no. no luck. 

<i>this could be the end of everything</i>

today is good. today's a cool day. the weather is warm, but there is still a chill that nips at your skin.

every few months i like to go downtown to take a peek at what some of the stores have to offer. there was next to nothing of interest today. i was a little disappointed. i think i was made for north end shopping. 

<i>oh simple thing
where have you gone...</i>

my mom says my face keeps changing everyday slightly. i've reached my 6th month post-surgery. the swelling should be all gone by now according to the doctor. 

kate mentioned that she was looking at old pictures of me and she could really see the difference now. she said it's a change that she didn't realize at first.

<i>...and i need something to rely on</i>

'we have many songs besides love fool my friends'. when they were playing katy rose came out and watched them <i>right beside me</i>. i didn't even notice it until katie whispered this information to me. i was like <i>gaaassspppp</i>. i think katy rose is so brilliant. le sigh. 

one concert i can't stop drifting back on is <b>interpol</b>. holy hell. what a fantastic concert. i remember during the end of 'nyc' the lights on the stage were all blues and whites. against the hazy fog it was just a vision. i wrapped my arms around ashley's neck and just yelped 'i'm so happy!' haha. plus, to hear a song you've adored forever performed live - words cannot express. ear poetry!

must. stop. buying. clothing. -- but i want a puma track jacket i saw the other day so bad, but it's a wallet-busting 80 smackers. so not in the cards right now. 

budgeting has become second nature since i began owning plastic. visa has been very good to me, even up't my limit a few weeks ago. 
 
p.s. i want a fedora very badly (like the hat paul banks is wearing in my icon) and also one of those emo hats. yeah, ESPECIALLY an emo hat. at work i saw a girl decked out in an entire outfit i am ready to copy. from hat to belt, she was emo couture. emo's are so hot right now.

god, don't you love my phases? 

oh, when ashley and i went shopping the other day i bought a pair of 'mary-kate' sunglasses. her and i call them that because they remind us of the glasses mary-kate olsen wears -- big and really not that great looking on her, but their hot. now i just need EMO GLASSES!

"event","people are really in panic mode about this election's outcome. i really don't like the fact that bush is president anymore then the next person, but i'm pretty sure the world isn't about to end.

bush won because people are afraid. it is as simple as that. kerry's campaign was too 'radical' for a good majority of american's. yes to gay marriage? pro abortions? no real idea of how to handle the iraq situation?

people are scared of what they don't know and can't understand. change is not good. bush gave them some reasurrance or at least some sense of comfort in the fact they wouldn't have to deal with a change in the ordinary american lifestyle. 

i heard a person say 'american's will not change their horse mid-stream' - i think that sums it up well. the people of america are in the middle of a mess of some sorts, they want the man who started it to finish it. or at least the majority want that.

and this whole 'vote or die' movement didn't work. only 10% of the vote was 18 - 24 years olds, which is the basically the exact same percentage as the number of votes the election in 2000 had from that same demographic. 

though, this election did have a record number of people registering. 

this was a close race, and though bush is victorious - it wasn't much of a victory. he knows he has to win basically half the countries respect over the next four years. everyone will be watching, and i mean <b>everyone</b>. this is just what i think about this whole deal though, no one has to agree.

- semisonic (if they want to get back together)
- interpol (their a band i want to see as many times as possible before i depart from this life)

in the past five days i've slept in my own bed once. my mom told me out of the three of her kids she envies my social life the most. heh.

a few months ago i wrote in my [pen and pad] journal that nothing turned me on anymore. then i saw paul banks. it's the swoopie haircut. it does me in everytime.

carrie: he's so your type.
ashley: really? you think?
me: he's only ashley's type if he doesn't know how to call her back or generally respect her. that seems to be her type lately. 

heh.

muse was fan-freaking-tastic. allison and i arrived at the club around 9:30. fashionably late of course. i wore my devil julius paul frank shirt and recieved a handfull of compliments (including one really cute guy telling me it was 'the best monkey shirt ever!' teehee). 

allison and i motored up to the balcony and found a decent spot to the left of the stage. there were a few people standing in front of us so at times my line of vision was blocked, but four songs into the concert three people left allowing allison and i to rock out.

my favourite song of the night was definitely 'hysteria' because that song fucking rules and 'stockholm syndrome' because i love screaming the line <i>and i wish i could!</i>. a stoned out guy and i 'rail danced' to that song too. ha. good times. 

the atmosphere was great and reminded me a lot of when i saw interpol which makes me feel warm and fuzzy. cept muse rocked out a lot harder.

when we went in a rent-a-cop went through my purse, pulled out my camera, and told me to give her the batteries. she said i could get them back at the end of the show and that they'd be in her pocket with the other bunch of batteries she confiscatied. 

well, i didn't like that idea considering they were 50 dollar re-chargable batteries. i heard a bouncer say 'if you leave you can't come back' but i asked if i could go put my camera in my car. she said to tell the bouncer that i was going to do that. i did and he and two other staff guys took a peek at my camera and decided it was okay the my camera wasn't a professional and didn't have a zoom (which was wrong on both accounts). the girl cop kept trying to tell them they shouldn't let me keep my camera, but they didn't care. booyeah bitch.

i'm seeing jessica for the first time in weeks tonight because we got into a fight which means now we're officially for reals friends.

yesterday i went to starbucks and then jack astor's with mo, rob, and ashley. it was definitely a great night. when we were kicked out there was a hazy fog settling over the area. it was gorgeous. ashley and i decided to find out what it's like to be caught between the moon and forrest city (all that you can do is dance!).

i just recieved a letter saying i owe the government <b>$1,300</b> because they recalculated my earnings from 2003 and found i apparently made $15,000 as opposed to the $8,000 my t4 states i earned.

i know i didn't make $15,000 and if i did that is really sad that i only have $1,000 in savings to show for it! 

has this happened to any of <u><b>you</b></u> or <b><u>anyone you know</b></u>? i am so stressed out right now. what am i suppose to do?

my dad said this kind of thing happens often to him and that he'll take care of it but i am still a big ball of jitters just thinking about it.

but i keep my chin up. a band i desire to see live will come my way soon enough.

like maybe <b>the strokes</b> who's <i>room on fire</i> album blew my fragile unstable mind. loves it. 

my cellphone's battery is on re-call. i have a kyocera SE47 and i've been trying to download ringtones i want like franz ferdinand and snow patrol with no success. i went through a kyocera message board and saw a post telling people to call the customer service to see if your battery is part of the recall. 

well, i called and it is. apparently they are overheating which i think is true because after some conversations my phone would be scortching. 

before i called though i went to bell world to get a USB cable so i can download mp3's into my phone and use them as ringtones (having paul bank's howl <i>it's up to meeeeeeeeee now turn on the brrrriiiiiiiight lights</i> everytime someone rings me would be a dream). they didn't have the cable and informed me it comes in a package for 100 dollars. screw. you. 

i just purchased the same USB cable off the internet for 20 dollars. ha. 

last wednesday i drove to the united states of america with ashley, sam, and jessica. we made it there is 45 minutes. heh. i heart aeropostale. hollister had the best clearance. shirts for 6 dollars are a good thing. the best purchase i made were my <a href=""http://www.skateboard.com/products/11048.jpg"" target=""new"">checkered slip on vans</a>. they are so beautiful.

we're going back next week when we all actually have money and more space on our credit cards. 

i went to the ortho this morning. he put the elastic power chain on and i fucking hate it. not only does it tenderize my teeth it looks hideous to boot.

he said when i go back in 4 weeks he'll know exactly when i can get them off. i asked when the latest time would be and he said 'january'. okay. okay. i think i can make it to january. i'm ready to have my teeth back.

maybe it was thursday afternoon when my computer was acting whack. well, i had my brother look at it and he said we had once again downloaded a virus. fuck off. my brother says it is from downloading music off of <b>winmx</b>. does anyone know if there is a <u>safe</u> and <u>free</u> mp3 downloader available so i can switch and never have to deal with viruses?

i had windows xp. the pretty one. now my brother downgraded us to windows 2000 and it frustrates me. he basically has refused to help my sister and i take care of this computer (it use to be in his room, then we moved it to the tv room). it is so frustrating because for 16 years of having a computer i haven't had to learn how to use or download programs. now if i want to be able to have anything decent i have to go buy it and install it myself. it isn't a huge deal, just a small frustration. 

the internet is slower on this computer now. i'm two deep breaths away from bashing in the screen. 

this week i bought two new cds; <b>gavin degraw</b> and <b>the hives</b>. an old friend of mine's brother works at the music store i buy most of my music and he rang me through and said i had 'come a long way' in my music tastes. heh. 

i realized i had missed brennan's birthday so i went to the mall and bought a card and a gift certificate to the famous players theatre and delieved it to his house. i gave it to his mom and she asked if i wanted to see him, but i said no. i may still care about him, but i still feel pretty disrespected. he had a pretty good friend if you ask me... 

the chi straightener has certainly been put to work this week. here's a picture of me sitting here listening to my discman because since we rebooted the computer the window media player refuses to work. go gavin go!

"event","i begin fasting for the month tomorrow! 

okay, now for yesterday.

my dad was going to drive ashley and i to toronto, but the thought of him having nothing to do while her and i went to the concert was a terrible one. i kept begging my parents to just let <u>me</u> drive. toronto is a two hour drive from london so i understood it was asking a lot, but come on! i've had my license for almost two years and the farthest they've allowed me to drive was grand bend (which is an hour give or take). 

longstoryshort they let me drive. we were on our way by 6:15 and arrived there at 7:45 and that was including a missed exit and two missed turns (ashley + i do not = great map readers). HA! i am so the highway master. i loves me the fast lane. 

when we left i just plopped the tickets on my backseat and forgot to put them somewhere safe. we park at the venue and i turn around and the tickets were <b>gone</b>. we dug all around the car and just as i was about to have a mental breakdown ashley pulled them out from under the seat. PHEW.

we walk in and the first band ('social scene' i believe) is already playing. they were pretty good. i can't remember the name of the second band that played, but i hated them and couldn't wait for them to leave.  

ashley and i moved around a lot trying to find a good spot where the both of us could actually see. 

around 10:45 interpol took to the stage and every last bit of stress i had felt during the day seemed <i>so</i> worth it. 

i attempted to take pictures, but i quickly found it was of no use as the lighting and fog on the stage cleverly made the guys barely visible in most of my snaps. here's two of the better ones.

at some points paul and carlos looked coked out (most likely because they were).
</lj-cut></center>
i loved how paul would say 'thanks, thanks a lot' after every few songs. that was basically the most he said. i adore his voice (singing or speaking). it is sex. 

we left the venue before the encore because i had already heard all the songs i needed to and then some. so we left at 12. drove around toronto for like 20 minutes looking for a gas station. decided to just go back onto the highway. missed the expressway. found it again. stopped in brampton to get gas. stopped in hamilton to get ice caps. all of this and we still got home before 2am. i am good. 

when i got home i found my chi hair straightener had arrived! yay!

then as i type this i wonder if i should even bother as in many times past said person has recieved great words of advice from me among many of her other friends on various issues and she never seems to bother using it.

i'm not one for wasting words.

all i can wonder frankly is how many times must she bang her head against a wall before she finally screams out 'ow'?

i'm torn...so very torn. 

friday night was AWESOME. emo hunting at geets is <i>so</i> underrated. i should just give in and realize i am just a magnet for big black guys (i think it's my ghetto ba-donka-donk). rachel was definitely the x-factor. ashley and carrie loved her. 

the geets dj played some fucking great tracks like the 'sexual healing' remix which made me scream with excitment and basment jaxx's 'where's your head at'. we raved like it was on sale for $19.99.  

much to the dismay of everyone i know (namely ashley) i have purchased red ugg boots because i am so easily swayed by what everyone else is doing. ha. no one has red ugg's (yet) though so i'm somewhat still a little original in that aspect (yes that does help me sleep better at night).

i was so bored yesterday i went on msn (that's pretty bored).

then i ended up staying up until 2:30 in the morning talking to people (matt makes me laugh very hard) and playing games with ashley. i won every game except the last game of pool which we decided to make a bet on. loser had to buy the winner a pin off of this neat site i found. it's the last shot. i get the 8 ball in and end up also sinking the blank ball or whatever it's called so i lost! >:S

while i was randomly searching through ebay last week i found a painting inspired by monet's 'waterlillies' done by a independent artist. the price was 200 dollars so i bid and ended up winning the auction. i showed my parents and they said they'd buy it for me as a birthday gift.

'garden state' surprisingly hit a london theatre this week. after work yesterday (i hate 9 hour days) ashley and i went to the 10:30 showing. 

it definitely struck a chord with the both of us. ashley said a movie hasn't made her cry in years. i'm going to buy the soundtrack today when jessica and i go on a shop romp.

don't ask me why, but i feel compelled to purchase some <b>ugg</b> boots. i went on ebay and bid on a pair. if i win, i win - vice versa. 

friday night carrie, ashley, and i went to the drive-in to see princess diaries 2, without a paddle, and harold & kumar go to white castle. 

i'm addicted to ice-caps. everytime we drove past a tim hortin's i yelped 'who wants an ice-cap?!' after three or four times carrie said 'do you want an ice-cap or something?' 'you don't miss a beat'.

happy first day of school for you people with direction in life. hah. i'm kidding. i'm sure you all are as lost as i am.

i'm fat. i'm eating less and going on the treadmill. goal weight is 135. i think i can manage to lose 7 pounds without killing myself.  

i spent labour day at allison's cottage with rhys, mo, ryan, michelle, and baby. it was beautiful. i felt like we were the only people alive for a moment. i watched the sunset as i drifted in the water from wave to wave. moments like that don't happen often enough in our lives.

"event","it has been a crazy couple of days as usual in my so-called life (which btw is the show that replaced the brendan leonard show ---> bigfatsigh).

first, how hard did the mtv vma's blow? that really was the worst of the worst. i almost spent my night in to watch that trash but luckily brad talked me into going out to tj's (which i can never go back to because i've made far too many enemies in the staff).

i'm so obsessed with vintage and mod at this moment it isn't even funny. broach me bitch. emily and i are going to value village tomorrow to find some nifty blazers. 

<lj-cut text=""what happens next?"">
today i failed my <b>G</b> test for an incredible second time. ha! i was like 'there's no way i'll fail a second time' and well, as usual i prove myself very wrong. at first after i failed i was like fuckshitdamnitfuckmotherfuckercuntass, but an hour later i got over it. which really shows up the three days of moping i did after i failed the first time. 

eh, tests can be failed. that's the point of fearing and stressing over them. if you think the good life equals passing every test you can take then you're just as blind as your blind spot on your car (which i checked often, ha). 

frankly, i've never been impressed by a person's spotless grade record. infact i find that incredibly dull. we all do if you think about it. it is more entertaining to hear of someone's failure because that's when they <i>actually</i> learned something.

like i learned that speeding can get you disqualified from earning your G license. i went 92 on an 80 road. ah well, i consider the 160 dollars i've paid thus far a donation to the bettering of the driver's education building.

before my test i went practicing and [longstoryshort] ended up in strathroy. it was a very stressful experience, but now i am a highway master.
</lj-cut>

jessica, jamie, carrie, ashley, and i went to molly bloom's monday. it was an interesting night. we met guys from new zealand. they had cool accents, but that was about all they had going for them. jamie and jessica magg'ed out which resulted in us being thrown out. right as we were leaving ashley and i got called up to the stage for our karaoke number of 'sexual healing'. the bar was packed so it took us a few moments to get up there and when we did the guy said we were too late. humph. he was in a bad mood so i stole his pen. 

ashley, carrie, and i major is l-i-f-e 101. the hardest course you'll ever die to pass.

i camped out in ashley's backyard - yay! i camped! 

i've barely taken any pictures this summer. :/ i find that so odd seeing as this was one of the best summers i can remember having.

ashley and i watched <b>the girl next door</b> at ryan and michelle's the other night. it was a good movie with a good soundtrack. 

school's beginning again. i thought i'd feel empty or weird since i'm not going back but i still feel the same. i think since last year had such an uncomfortable beginning i just am happy not to have to go through that again. a year without essays, tests, due dates - it sounds like a dream at the moment. i might take night courses second semester when old navy hours will slow down. other then that i have no interest to think about school or boxed education for the next 8 months.

my ortho said i'll have my braces off before new years. nice. i don't mind the top ones since they're clear coloured, but now thanks to my jaw surgery you can see the bottom row quite clearly - it looks like their all capped. it's a little annoying.

i asked my ortho how the other nadine did with her jaw surgery since he had told me he had another patient by the same name getting surgery in the same month. he said she did very well and is happy with her new look. he said her surgery resulted in a much more drastic facial change then mine. everyone's was! ha. proving God has a sense of humour. i just have a better fit now which does make a difference for me [and apparently for others because people don't look at me like i'm a freak anymore] - but it didn't change my overall appearance which if you skip back a few months of entries you can see me litterally praying for.

there's a good chance i'll never be pretty enough for myself, but maybe now i'll finally step back and figure out why."

that's okay. i can wait. i'm going to get his number and call him next week. he'll freak out, but i really just want to date him once so i have bragging rights about the fact that i dated someone so damn eye-pleasing.

monique cancelled our plans for tonight and that pissed me the hell off. this is a summer record of three nights in a row of staying in. :/ i'm getting restless. lol. well actually it was kind of nice that i stayed in because then i had an excuse to catch the final few episodes of <u>the brendan leonard show</u> that were airing on family channel. i taped a few. tonight's was my favourite. <i>don't orbit me!</i>. god...genius. lol. 

then yesterday i went on msn for the first time in like 6 months and randomly chatted with a few people i <i>never</i> talk to anymore. one of them being my friend andria. it was so weird and funny to talk to her again. she hasn't changed much. she showed me all of her snap shots of her new house. they painted it really fun vibrant colours - i love that. 

she invited me to ikea this saturday which i thought was so nice of her considering we haven't gotten together since november's john mayer concert (she was at the most recent one too, small world). unfortunatly i can't go since i'll be working and attending ashley's party. plus i <i>just</i> got rid of a lot of little nick-nacks in my room (which is incredible because i have a tough time giving things up), it's for the best that i'm not tempted to buy more crap.

what's humourous is today when i was working i saw andria's mom and little brother. i was like 'what are the odds?' that's funny. i also saw tammy's mom who i love. she's so nice. both andria's mom and her said i looked like i had lost a lot of weight which i love hearing at the moment since i'm actually gaining. lol.

i just chatted with andria on msn and she told me her mom told her that i looked 'so gorgeous'. hah. there's an adjective i rarely hear.  

yesterday i spent the day with carrie and ashley. we lunched at <u>swiss chalet</u> (i'm addicted to their chicken caeser salad). i couldn't believe it when carrie told me she had never eaten their before. that's like a canadian institution (though ashley is sure it is american, but i didn't think so). everyone's been there. jamie had never eaten their either when we went a previous time, but that didn't surprise me as much.

earlier tonight i spoke to kate and we were talking about what we thought would happen in our futures and i mentioned that old navy will definitely be my last retail job. i want to work in offices, start from the bottom and work my way up. i want set hours. old navy hours are so unpredictable. it's so frustrating. anyway she informed me about an office administration position at city hall. i didn't mean that i needed that office job now, but it would be nice if i got this particular job.  

it also gave me an excuse to work on my cover letter / resume which definitely needed a little updating. 

<b>i'm going to see <u><i>katy rose</i></u> a week from saturday!</b> awhellsya.  

i think alison is going with me but since she's the worst with e-mail she hasn't confirmed that yet. e-mail me or text me asap pleasepleaseplease. 

tomorrow i see lisa and rachel for the first time in months. i'm really interested to hear about lisa's time in new york. i hope she doesn't mind telling her stories one more time as i'm sure i'm the 50th person to hear them.

i wrote that yesterday in my journal at 3:23am because its TRUE! lol. i'm not sure if that's an original creation or if i stole that from somewhere.

yesterday i went to michelle and ryan's for a movie night. the boy who has sparked my interest ended up coming. before he showed up michelle and ryan warned me: 

them: he might not be friendly towards you cause i think he thinks we're trying to set him up. 
me: why does he have that impression?
them: he got the idea on the phone that i was 'up to something' 
me: urgh. 

so when he walked in through the screen door i normally would have greeted him warmly and asked how his weekend was, but alas knowing that he might think every smile, glance, or eye movement may have a hidden meaning i had to act like i could care less that he was around which was so hard. i knew though that that was just the only way to go about it because he scares off mighty easy. if he gets the slightest idea that ryan and michelle put me up to anything he won't want anything to do with it.   

my plan worked out in the end as he 'came to me' as i put it. ashley's having a party this weekend. expect me to take advantage of him then. frankly, life's too short to worry about being rejected. 

i love that i make him laugh and i love that he makes me laugh. his smile is so sweet and his eyes are so deep. it is all enough to make this girl weep. lol. ryhming rocks. 

from my spot on the opposite side of the room i peered over at him a few times in the night. his lips, oh me oh my. how i can't wait to taste them. 

i think i'm just really out of my mind with sexual frustration. 

< / end boy lust rant > 

other then that whole scenerio the night was quite fun! it was michelle, ryan, ashley, carrie, loverboy, and i. we rented <b>along came polly</b>, which to its credit is much much funnier then i expected it to be. then we watched these hilarious campy cartoon's and around 2:30 we all left. ashley, carrie, and i wanted mcdonald's so in each of our cars we convoyed to the local micky d's to see there was a delivery trunk blocking the drivethrough! gasp! 

so we drove to another one. one after another going into the drivethrough like doofs, then parking and having a pic-a-nic in my car. then we all wanted more food so we went through one more time but all in the same vehicle which the guy working found amusing.

the night before was even funnier but i'm lazy and i don't want to type it all out. all i can say is ashley, brad, and i found the place we're going to retire!

i'd hate to steal heather's line, but i'm a silly little girl right now and there's only one way to sum up my mood - <i>le sigh</i>..."

"event","ahh my life is over, family channel is cancelling <b>the brendan leonard show</b>! i'm going to tape tonight's episode and savour every laugh. harharhar.

<i>a brendan leonard moment...</i>

brendan: do you guys ever just think about time and how fast it passes? 
patrick: brendan, do you want a pizza or not? 
brendan: but, you get the pizza and it's not about the food, it's about the camaraderie. eating the pizza with friends... 
kevin: i hate you. 

<i>...that was a brendan leonard moment</i>

well i'll start off with the shitty news for my fans but great news for people who don't like me and secretly root for me to fail (i'm rooting for your failure too jerkwads, ::shakes fist:: lol.) anyway <b>i failed my G roadtest</b>. i'm like the <u>only</u> person i know who's failed it. i knew i was going to do something so radonkulous that i would just automatically fail just like i did on my G2 test. 

my G2 doesn't expire until 2007 so it isn't like i'm royally fucked but it would have been nice to have gotten it out of the way. 

i entered onto the 402 highway at a speed of 80 (i entered super early so that's why it was at a low speed) and you need to be at least going 100. the <i>one</i> time i'm not going 100 in my whole driving career and i fail for it. apparently that rule is some stupid official ontario traffic law - whatever! lol. i was like 'i'm so failing' the second i saw a women walk towards my car. it is a common fact that if you get a women examiner you are fucked. lol.

ah well. i've got it booked in another month. the women said i would have passed had it not been an automatic failure. son of a bitch. i swear i am one in a fucking billion. it's a gift and a curse people.

other then that i've had a really good last few days. 

<lj-cut text=""theBIGconcert"">
the <b>maroon5 / john mayer</b> concert was <i>amazing</i>. like you didn't expect it to be, right? the drive down was so much fun cause rhys-a-roni and his friend drove ashley, jill, allison, and i. situations are that much more fun with rhys is involved. while we were driving there was a girl in a green bug and she kept looking at rhys and smiling. the back windows of allison's van are tinted so she couldn't see us so i climbed up to the front and shook my head no and slid my finger across my throat at her. she left rhys alone after that. 

time went by really fast that day. it seemed like i blinked and we were sitting in our seats in anticipation. maroon 5 were so good. everyone kept saying they put on a great show and they definitely do. adam looked tasty. i love the keyboard player - he was so funny. he was like rocking out and picking up the keyboard and like trying to get everyone to look at him. 

i was so excited when they sang 'the sun' which is probably my personal favourite. i sang pretty loudly (and annoyingly) to every song though. they didn't play 'must get out' though and i was bummed! :P 

for john mayer i told ashley and jill that i'd switch my ticket with one of them. we planned that i would stay for the first two songs to get pictures, then go switch seats with ashley who would stay for three songs, then come back and jill would sit for the rest of the concert. he was really good! it was awesome to see those slick facial expressions live! lol. 

when ashley and i were sitting in the 400 section all we did was talk and make fun of people and yell at people to sit down. then i was like 'let's go walking'. so we did and we found new seats in the 300 section. then we walked again and found better seats. then we continued and ended up back in the same area as jill and allison! lol. so it was an awesome night. probably the second best concert i've been to. its hard to put the night into words and make it sound as great as it was.  
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""'i'm seriously gonna vomit'""> 
yesterday kate, lauren, emily, and i made the annual 'canada's wonderland trip'. the toronto weather websites kept saying their was going to be a severe thunderstorm but we went anyway because i heard the best days to go to wonderland were rainy days. 

so we got there and it was dead. line ups were like 10 minutes tops. it was great. now we didn't end up going to wonderland last year so it had been two years since her and i had been on a rollercoaster and even longer for em and lauren. i said 'lets go on vortex first' and the whole [short] time we were waiting we were all shitting our pants. it was bad. we were like: 

'i'm so nervous!'
'my heart is beating so fast'
'i have to pee!'

lol. the whole way up the track all four of us just screamed and screamed. it's terribly trematic when you go down that drop for the first time. you know you won't like it, but you also know its inevitable. 

needless to say we road it three times in a row. lol.  

i personally love the wooden rollercoasters that look like their really about to fall to the ground. there's two really good ones at wonderland. minebuster and the beast (emily thinks it would be scarier if they called it 'da beast'). we went on mindbuster after vortex i think? it was so funny. its got a pretty steep drop so kate was seriously whailing all the way up. 

then we went on this crazy new ride that's called sledgehammer. its messed. it is a lot scarier then it looks. it drops you and then spirals you up in the air. it was insane. after going on that two times in a row i was definitely regretting that cheeseburger i had maowed down. i was really close to barfing all of some kids. lol. 

we went to wait inline for the new tomb raider rollercoaster when i was like 'i'll seriously vomit all over you if i go on this, i need to laydown.' my head wouldn't stop spinning. so kate took me and we laid down on a bench by the carasell. we're just laying there when this kid comes with a whistle and blows it and then like 50 teenage jewish guys come stomping by! i was like 'holy yamaca's batman!!' 

then i felt better so when emily and lauren came back we went on more rides. lauren had never been on 'the bat' which isn't too bad of a coaster. it goes forwards and backwards. we got seats right in the front which meant we'd be the highest up going backwards. lauren was not siked at all! lol. i wish they still took pictures of you when your on the coaster - lauren's face would have been priceless!

we went to the water park which was hilarious. the whole day kate and i kept getting in fights with people in line. i don't know what it was. 'i don't have many fans today' i said when i noticed this one girl glare at me. lol. she glared again and i said 'yeah, that meant you.' haha. she didn't dignify that with an answer. just a look like 'you are so weird'. 'i bet we'd be friends if we met under different terms!' lol. she really didn't care. 

kate's girl was funnier. we were waiting to go on a slide where they have a bunch of you sit in a tube. these girls had butted infront of us and i was like 'that's the back of the line' and she mumbled something but i didn't hear her and i just rolled my eyes and let her be. then like 5 minutes later her sister (you could tell cause they looked alike) and some lil' girl come up and butt with them. kate's like 'anyone else you wanna bring with you?' and the girl turns around and says 'its one tube isn't it?' and kate gave her the HARSHEST glare. lol. i was like 'yiiikes!' then we get up there and see you can only have 4 people in a tube and they have 5 so they have to split up and kate yells 'one tube eh?' now <u>that</u> is a burn my friends.

so anyway after the waterpark we all split a funnelcake and then went to squareone for some shopping. then we went to outback for a tasty dinner.

kate was so tired she told us 'okay don't let me fall asleep guys'. everytime she would she's get emily and i to sing 'redneck women' to her. lmao. kate and lauren had never heard it before so it was very amusing. then we surfed the radiostations stopping on good sing along songs. 'this love' being the best one. there was a big traffic jam so i sang it to the other cars to entertain them. then i sang it to a cop who was sitting in his car on the side of the road and lauren said 'he was quite impressed! you could tell by his face!' ahthankyou.
</lj-cut> 
<lj-cut text=""'uhhh i wasn't lying'"">

alison and i made time for one another for a second week in a row. AMAZING! adventures never cease when we're together. 

i went to alison's apartment and found her outside with her room mates looking like the cool shit she is. she hangs with black people. word! lol. we went and got her room mate hair dye. then alison and i went to stalk brennan because alison is so obsessed with him and won't admit it and uses me as an excuse. he wasn't home but at least this time we could knock on the door since it was midnight like the last time we visited. 

then alison and i went to jack astor's and enjoyed a big sundae and talked which is a very good combination. then BRENNAN walks into jack astors. i went and leapted onto him (litterally - one of those leg-wrap hugs, first one i've ever given! lol.) alison pee's herself with excitment! he goes off with his friend and alison and i finish up. then we go to my car and alison spots him on the patio. i tell him he's a pig and we continue on.  

alison and i were driving and this was before my G test so i'm like 'where's the 401?' and she tells me and we go and right before we go on she's like 'have you ever driven on the 401 before?' 'no.' 'omg nadine!' haha too late now hoe. we ended up in doorchester and thanks to my fantastic sense of direction we got lost. lol. we saw a tim hortin's with a bunch of people in the parking lot so we sped in and ask 'where's the 401?' lol. on closer inspection we see that these are like high schoolers and some are very attractive! some guy tells me but he's laughing so i drove over to other people and go 'is he lying?' and i hear 'uh i'm not lying to you.' lol. they were all like 'here follow us!' but we didn't since i finally understood where to go. 

then alison was like 'lets go back!' but how stupid would that look on our part? lol. but our chances would have been good as there were like 15 guys and two other girls. haha i liked the two other girls faces 'what are they doing here?' we were the tasty city girls! come ride with us boys! lol. i'm sure we made their night.

ahh here's to what could have been.

"event","i'm home! i'm home! chicago was fun but my sister's overall presence was indeed a damnper during the trip. i love chicago. its such a great city. i could go year after year and love it as much as the first time! 

this time i wanted to go to the museum's chicago had to offer because i had heard good things about them. well, stupid me - i didn't do my research and mixed up the 'museum of contemporary arts' with the 'chicago art institute'. the problem with that being contempo art is a little more 'out there' and definitely outside the lines. i love art of any kind so i got a real cultural mental kick out of the contemporary art museum...but the rest of my family - ooh boy. lol. my mom got into it, but my dad was like 'is this art? its just a pair of shoes hanging from the ceiling?' my sister wandered off on her own so who knows (or cares) what she thought. 

it was at times intense and disturbing and other times just bullshit (i don't care what you say, a few strategically placed pieces of wood is not art, its a junkpile). i'm glad we went. contemo art looks at life from a completely different angle and i appreciate that.

after that my mom and sister opted to shop but my dad and i decided to walk over to the 'art institute'. we got there and there was a sign that said admission was free. my dad and i were confused so i asked a lady who worked there and she said 'yes, since the museum is closing in 15 minutes its free.' yipes!! i literally bolted up the stairs and quickly paced around the entire place. i wasn't even aware what the musuem carried so imagine my surprise when i found myself halted in my tracks in a room filled with <i>monet</i> paintings. beauty has a whole new definition to me now. seeing those paintings right infront of you...ahhh words cannot describe. i decided to wander at a slower pace and wound up in a van gogh exhibit. my eyes were watering from the intense joy and circus of sights!! what views these two little brown's of mine have now seen.

ah, it totally made the trip right there. 

that was basically my favourite day. you can't not get something from viewing art in its rawest form. 

shopping in chicago is superb. i didn't get to go to the paulfrank store since it was 30 minutes (by car) away from downtown. who puts their store that far away?

its official, i dislike urban outfitters more and more after every visit. i found a shirt that says i heart falafel and i wanted it sososo bad but it didn't come in a medium and i was so sad. 

i found two fun shirts at <b>forever 21</b>. i think it was a tween store, but i'm still a tween at heart. also went to an <b>H&M</b> for the first time and loooooooved it. so reasonably priced and so fun! plus it had the best fucking store soundtrack i've ever shopped too (interpolYES!). 

then i bought the new maroon 5 accoustic album and snow patrol album at <b>virgin</b>. that's one funky ass cd store. i asked the clerk when interpol's new album was coming out and the girl on cash next to her snapped her head over at me and asked 'you like interpol?' and i was like 'hells ya - i'm with it' - proceed to tripping and knocking over a cd rack - haha just kidding but that would have been hilarious. 

so good times! lots of writing in my journal. i didn't write in it at all during my healing process, instead i opted to put my energy into another personal project so it felt really good to write again after such a long time.
 
i had a really good sex dream the other night. seriously, it was refreshing. lol. i don't know why it was with brendan leonard though. that came out of no where. bow-chica-wow-wow. 

i'm so tired. it was a long ass drive. still have to unpack my louis bag. lol. that thing holds everything! what a good investment.

<i>i cannot forget, refuse to forget, so glad i met you</i>

maroon 5 will be loved tomorrow night. oh yes, they will.

edit: ryan and michelle have made a date for their wedding - august 2005. its going to be at a resort somewhere in cancun - ahhh! good thing WESTERN DIDN'T WANT ME so now i can make money! lol. actually western regretted to inform me that they overbooked the course and had no room for moi! boohoo! least i know it wasn't because of my marks - therefore i'll get in next year! i have a good feeling about a year off..."

"event","tomorrow morning i leave to shy-town (english: chicago!). i'm kind of not realizing what a big deal this is to me. i'm too sleepy. 

i haven't been to the beach once since summer began for me and would you believe it i went twice in the last week? i went on thursday with ashley and jessica to grand bend. the day looked like it had tanning patential but alas upon arriving at the beach the sun had decided to take the day off. so we swam, relaxed, and then shopped. it was a good day, and a long one too. :S lol. 

then today kate and lauren took me to port stanley. it was a hot hot day. 28 degrees, 38 with the humidex. so let the tanning begin. we swam, laid, swam, laid, got something to eat at mackies, laid, swam, laid, swam, laid, went home. lol. i am the most burnt i've ever been in my life and probably the most tanned too. 

it was funny, well annoying at the time but funny now - port stanley has a very small parking lot by the beach and well people get fed up and make up parking spots. i can understand this, but at least use your fucking brain and don't block other cars. we walk back to lauren's car and there's a car parked behind her in the middle of the lane-way of the lot. who does that? honestly? so anyway i'm like 'what a fuck-tard, get me a piece of paper and a pen.' they do as i say and i write the following note: 

<i>dear fucking retard:
way to park right behind my car like a big fat cow
hope you enjoyed your day bitch
you smell and no one likes you</i>

well <u>we</u> found that amusing, i can't promise any amusment for the rest of you reading it now.

oh wait, this is funny. when we went into mackies after we had been tanning for 3 hours i was looking at the menu and i saw it said 'sushi' and i was like 'they serve sushi here!?' and kate and lauren are like 'where? where does it say that?' and of course i'm talking loud and i'm pointing at where it is on the menu board when like 5 random people in line turn around and say 'it says slush' and you could just tell how stupid everyone must have thought i was! lol. needless to say we pee'd ourselves laughing for the rest of the wait in line. 

see, now that made you laugh! seriously! my eyes were not all 20/20 after being out in the bright sun for so long. :( 

anyway, <b>leave me comments</b> not because i bolded that, but because you LOVE me and you want to give me something to come back to (other then the maroon 5 concert!!!!!!!)

"event","the maroon5/john mayer concert is just a little over a week away. needless to say i am siked, but now after a recent turn of events i'm even <i>more</i> pumped. rhys (allison's boyfriend) called my cellphone the other night and i thought he was wasted...

me: are you drunk?
him: drunk on you, baby! 

after telling him i was thoroughly weirded out he informed me he was just occupying the phone until allison was done doing her business in the washroom. phew. that was bizarre.

allison got on the phone and we chatted for a few moments before she told me the purpose for the phone call. a friend of hers also going to the m5/jm concert ended up scoring a pair of general admission tickets after she had purchased tickets online. allison had told her of our shittah seating and she offered them up to us. we <i>were</i> section 401 row J, but now we're section 203 row J. now i will actually be able to see some facial expressions. hip hip hooray!

today was the picture perfect day to catch a few ray's and turn my otherwise pasty white skin into a nice shade of brown. i acheived a base tan and my first sunburn the other day when i went swimming at kate's so today was all about colourizing. my tummy is probably the darkest its been in a long time. i most likely sunburned my shoulders. i can never tell. 

i'll get another chance to tan sunday since i think kate, lauren, and i will be beaching the day away in port stanley. who knows though. plans do fall through. 

i went through quite a few cds while i tanned for two hours. i listened to my <b>katy rose</b> cd for the first time in ages. i think i've listened to it one other time since buying it. its not that it wasn't great music - cause it is, i just kept getting pre-occupied with other cds i was buying at the time.

there's one song on her cd that reminded me of someone who reads this journal. i won't say who for fun. they'll know. i hope said person doesn't get offended. i just thought of them when i heard the lyrics.

by katy rose

you can close you're eyes and tell me
that you are a visionary
and maybe you're a little scary
but you take my breath away
when you say you'll always be there
it paints such a lovely picture
but no matter how you frame it
it's still pornography

nobody seems to hear
till i scream and shout
even if you tie me down
and you blow my candle out

i'll still glow
i'll still glow
i'll be the perfect someone that you'll never know
i'll still glow

i see this girl with so much anger
pacified by holding strangers
making peace with all her danger
by looking in the mirror
the pureness in my name is gone now
you've taken it too far but somehow
i'll lick my wounds and take the last bow
and hold my cold left hand

there's so many things 
that you rant about 
the only thing i know for sure
if you blow my candle out

i'll still glow
i'll still glow
i'll be the perfect someone
that you'll never know
i'll still glow

download some of her songs people, she's worth the effort. 

my brother left for new york today. lisa's there now. i leave on my vacation on monday (i hope). i think we're going to chicago. i love it there. plus they built a paul frank store since i was last there. bonus. downside? my sister is inviting herself along. i thought i was going to bring a friend but its useless and too expensive now. i'm not going to share a room with a friend and her. too weird.  

hey - i bought a shirt that says 'i love nerds' cause i do. <lj user=""amsterdam__""> good thing you mentioned buying one or else i would have had no one to copy!

old navy keep cutting my hours - retail is a nasty nasty bitch. 

i had quite the weekend. actually all the last week was super interesting and random. lol. let's see friday i spent the night with ashley, dayrel, jamie, and jessica. we thought supersize me was still playing but turns out it wasn't and we looked like tards. so we rented <i>cold moutain</i> and crashed at jessica's kittie filled house. saturday alison and i <i>finally</i> apparently made the time for one another. the night in a nutshell: 

the notebook: NO
downtown: YES
parking: NO
finding tyler: YES
Geets lineup: HELL NO
mcdonald's: 'suck my dick'
fast eddie's: 'we've had enough vagina's tonight' 'alison will show you one boob if you wave that 20 cent charge' 
eating and talking: yesyesyes!

sunday i worked it up and then went to tj's with carrie, ian, ashley, brad, mo, rob. we ordered nacho's that costed 18 dollars. each of us ate like three chips, not even - and the rest of the nacho's had nothing on them. we basically paid 18 dollars to have a cook in the kitchen rip open a bag of tortia chips and pour them in the bowl. heeeellll no. i told everyone not to touch any of the left over chips and when the waitress came back to see how the nacho's were i told her 'uh actually their really shitty.' and wahwahwah. long rant short we got more cheese and veggies (and spit most likely) for free.

ashley and i kept asking brad what he remembered from that night at ashley's which turned out to be nothing. he didn't remember saying 'you're fired' or dancing with me to blind melon. lol.

ashley's having another get together tonight. i'll be bringing my bathing suit this time. ;)"

"event","awhile ago i read <u>fiona apple</u> was set to release her new album <i>extraordinary machine</i> and i was like 'oh good, some new music from her...' then months pass and the other day i was listening to her album <i>tidal</i> and wondered what had become of this album that i had read about. 

turns out she's completed the album but her record company <u>sony</u> shelved it because they didn't feel any of the songs would make a successful single and the overall sound of the album didn't leave the record company too enthused to release it. did you know that? really? i didn't. 

i've been hunting for the last 30 minutes and found two decent mp3's of songs from her shelved album. it isn't too different, but it is definitely not the same.  

<i>this world, this world is bullshit. you shouldn't model your life on what you think that we think is cool, and what we're wearing and what we're saying and everything. go with yourself. go with yourself</i> - fiona's acceptance speech at the 1997 mtv vma's. 

i've been sort of engulped by music lately. it seems so unfair that i'm just one person and there are hundreds upon thousands of songs out there that i love but i haven't heard them yet - and some i never will.

<i>oh mister wait until you see what i plan to be...</i>

this summer is running away. 

most people i know recieved their acceptance from western last week and though i did get a few letters - none of them were holding my golden ticket into university. i am completely fine with not being accepted, but i never heard an official 'you were not accepted...' so i called western and apparently my application is <i>still</i> in review. i'll know in two weeks. i was so sure last week that i must not have gotten in that now even if i do i don't know that i want to go. oh shudder.  

it was a pretty busy week. i hung out with ashley, jessica, and jamie a lot. like on tuesday we saw <b>anchorman</b>. i haven't laughed that hard at a movie in a really long time. 

'you ate the whole wheel of cheese? i'm not even upset, that's impressive.'
'ahhh this heat - milk was not a good choice!' 

i want to change up my wardrobe. i'm a little unimpressed with my clothing lately. if only i could find clothing as different as my accessories. i've been buying a lot of 'custom' and 'one of a kind' stuff lately from online indie stores just because i love wearing things most people won't/don't. my style is really weird. i would like to make it more then just a paul frank tee and some jeans. i want to look a little more put together.

i'm going to go to white oaks today for a bit. see if i can't find a few random things."

"event","every so often i get into (or back into) something and then go on a huge spending spree for it. it was earring for a little while, but now its belts. everyone always told me i needed to get a belt ('pull up your pants, nadine'). so i bought one and now my collection is steadily growing. i just purchased a super-keen paul frank belt off of ebay. 

sunfest came to london this past week - hizzah. i love these little festivals they throw in the park. there are lots of vendors from all over canada who come with their perdy unique items for me to poop on...and then buy. this year's sunfest seemed much much bigger then the years prior. it might be just me though. i found some neat stuff and bardered a little bit. well actually i just worked my 'sad little girl' angle. i would go to the vender in a sad voice 'i really want this, but i only have this much.' and they fell for it everytime. 

one booth they had this year was 'graffiti art'. for 20 dollars you could get a trucker hat with any graffiti design you wanted. i knew i wanted to get one, but i didn't know what i wanted to get on it. finally i was like 'hey, how about radonkulous!?' and ashley and cassandra (who i went with) laughed and said it was a good idea. they tell you to come back in an hour so we went around the park looking at all the booths and when we were all down we went back. the hat is <i>so</i> rad. just like my vocab. 

friday night i went downtown for the first time post-surgery. it was quite the night, taking me and the others (mo, ashley, cassandra, jamie, and jessica) from geets to jim bob's to barney's. i ended up sleeping over at ashley's house in her sister's room! i've always wanted to sleep on the top of the a bunk bed. 

i had a bit of a frustrating saturday night / sunday thanks to my family. i ended up running out of my house with disc-man in hand around midnight to cool down. i walked around, huffed and puffed, then laid down in the grass to watch the stars. when i was walking down the boardwalk to my street i saw the rav4 drive by. i didn't realize i was gone for as long as i was and my mom ended up going to look for me. 

i sat on the porch awaiting the maulling i would be getting once she arrived back home. she didn't really get very angry with me but made me come in the house to talk. it was weird to finally hear my mom refer to me as 'depressed' i guess it made it all the more real to me that i was now that my own mother sees it.

the next day i had to work at 1 o' clock. my mom and sister both knew that. 12:45 and i'm ready to go but my mom's on the treadmill and my sister is in the shower. i leave the following note:

<i>i said i needed to be at work at 1 o' clock. yet, mom's on the treadmill and lena's in the shower once again proving no one really gives a shit about me. taking the car.</i>

i'm sick of caring more about some people then they do about me. 

semisonic's album <b>feeling strangely fine</b> is the best 2 dollars (yes, 2 dollars - thank you ebay) i've ever spent on anything. it definitely is giving coldplay's 'a rush...' a run for its money in my mind.

<lj-cut text=""she's balled up on the couch"">
<i>Now the rain comes down the windows and it
Drops onto the forehead of the waiting boy
He surveys his rental kingdom and he
Wonders if he's really lost his one joy

Another fool would go down to the
Only place she ever went to lose herself
She's gone to the movies now and she
Don't need your help

Now the rain turns into snowfall as the
City sky reflects the silver street below
And it covers up the cars and the Wall-

Another fool would dig the broken car out from the snow
And drive to find the show
She's gone to the movies now and she's
Not coming home
She's gone to the movies now and she's
Not coming home

Now he looks around his place and anyways
There's nowhere she could sit besides the bed
And he wonders if the car will start tomorrow
Or he'll have to take the bus instead

Any other fool would be out on the roadway
Trying to spot her rusted Pontiac
She's gone to the movies now and she's
Not coming back
She's gone to the movies now and she's
Not coming back</i>

"event","blah, feels like its been forever since i sat down and typed a proper entry.

today is election day. i definitely knew going in that i was voting for the NDP (New Democrat Party) mainly because they wanted to lower the post-secondary tuition prices (which are insane by the way - i can't believe we're all sitting back and taking it up the ass with these outrageous costs). i also liked the fact that jack layton made it clear that he really didn't want anything to do with the 'war' in iraq (can we really call that a war?).

so monique and i trucked down to our former public school. we saw so many people there that we knew, it was fun. i had to register there cause i'm a stupid ass and kept forgetting. the guy there was this guy i had met before in a random situation - he's so adorable! my name sounds so much sexier when he says it. hahaha. 'so nadine...' rawr. 

oh yeah, that's one thing that's pretty different now post-surgery, guys are so much nicer to me! lol. seriously, its not just me being a doof, guys are honestly treating me way better and i don't even look <i>that</i> different. now that the swelling is down and i've gotten use to my face i feel prettier - but at the same time i still look basically myself. my eyes are a tiny bit smaller and my nose is different - but these changes are only noticable to me. most people notice that my chin is different and i've been told by quite a few people my face is thinner (and i thought it was fatter!). 

anyway, original point - i voted and it felt really good to know i have a say in this election. 

still haven't gotten my rejection letter from western. i got a letter the other day from them and i was like 'oh no, it's small and flat. this can't be good.' but it turned out to be just a letter asking for my high school transcript. 

i remember telling ashley 'as soon as i can eat my social life is going to be crazy' and i was right. i've been fortunate enough to be going out lots and having things to do every day. i know these last two months are going to fly by for me. 

one of my favourite outtings was with my friends katie and matt to see the movie <b>the terminal</b>. we laughed the whole way through. at the end matt said 'i think we liked that movie the least but had the most enjoyable time watching it.' agreed! 

at the moment i'm scouting airline ticket prices to see what's the best deal i can get to go see sara ann at the end of the month. i hate the fact that airplane tickets to destinations within canada are so fookin' crazy expensive. if anyone knows any good cheap ways to get to victoria (other then 'flying pickles' as sara ann suggested) let me know. 

and <lj user=""sweety_230""> - we need to pick a good day to go T.O. shopping, so let me know when you are available!

started back at old navy yesterday. i was tired and hungry but it was a slow day so it wasn't so bad. we also got to go home an hour early. that's what i like to hear.  

going camping this weekend! hell ya!

brennan called me saturday for a brief chat. he had to go get ready for a camping trip (yay camping!) and at the end of the conversation he said he missed me! awwww. bern! so yeah, we're going to get together soon. and now we say 'love you' to one another! isn't that nice? i told him 'you aren't leading me on when you say that just so you know.' lol."

"event","whenever you are going through a healing process you are bound to have your good and bad days. today was more on the bad side. i had a really crap sleep last night. woke up around 1:45 today and just laid in bed until 3 o' clock listening to my <b>coldplay</b> and <b>maroon 5</b> (ahhhh! still can't believe i get to see them live! brennan's going to be <i>so</i> jealous) cd's. 

i basically have been experiencing just a lot of discomfort and aches for the better of my day. blah...

this was a good week though. oh, i almost forgot to type that <u>michelle gave birth to a healthy and happy baby boy thursday</u>. i can't wait to be called auntie nadine. 

alison's dance recital was this week. i was planning on going to see it with ashley, but the day i was going i found out that it was going to be lisa and i - which is fine by me but i felt bad telling ashley she couldn't come. haha. alison and i are on weird terms right now and hadn't spoken for like a week before so when lisa and i got there i didn't plan on seeing her before the show, but when we stepped through the doors there she was. i didn't want to make her feel bad or something before she goes to perform but i'm not comfortable with things yet so i was like 'yes' 'no' 'cool'. very one wordie. 

the recital was her best yet, definitely (aside from the opening act, last years was much better). there was some really good music beth hart, black eyed peas, and even maroon 5. alison has sprained her ankle on monday but by wednesday night was feeling a bit better. i think i made it worse cause right at the end of the 'harder to breathe' routine she and some of the others jump down from the stage. she leaped up onto the chairs right infront of lisa and i (we were second row - oh yeah, vip or bust) and i thought she was gonna leap over to i was like tugging on her arm to help her. lol. well, wrong. i think from that moment on her foot started to act up. oops. 

the most interesting part i found was her face...she was so animated this year. i don't remember ever watching her face over her feet in other recitals. it just shows you how comfortable she is up there and how much of a performer she is inside for it to finally make it outside.

by the end of the recital her foot was hurting really bad so she didn't feel like putting up with my shit. she and i barely spoke a word to one another which maybe wasn't that great of an idea but whatever. we're both adults, i think - so we'll deal.  

lisa and rachel (who was also there to see her sister dance) said i should take dance next year. i would if it wasn't going to be me, the freaky 19 year old in a class with like 13 year olds. no. but lisa and rachel both said they'd take dance if i did so maybe. if i definitely don't get into western (which i truly believe is a possibilty, lol) i'll probably take dance, or something. all that free time...

lisa was telling me about her weekend and one sort of thing i always notice in her stories is that when she goes out she usually drives, gets drunk, then drives home. okay, too be fair to her she says she can tell when she's okay to drive, but still that worries me. it isn't much of a problem when i go out with her cause it is usually me driving, just when she goes out with other people. i dunno, maybe you <i>can</i> sober up in two and a half hours. i certainly wouldn't know.

<i>i'm lifting you up
i'm letting you down
i'm dancing till dawn
i'm fooling around
i'm not giving up
i'm making your love
this city's made us crazy and we must get out</i>

allison came home from europe on thursday. i went over to visit her and sheena. it was a pretty hilarious night. sheena and i get along so well. at one point sheena said 'okay, we need to hang out with nadine more'. lol. sheena's going for her license wednesday (finally i've met someone lazier about getting their license!) so allison and i hopped into my rav4 with sheena so we could get her to practice driving. then we went and saw rhys's soccer game (which they lost) and then went back to allison's where we stayed to hear all of her stories.

i talked to monique on the phone this week. i missed her! she's one of those people who mean more to you then you realize. i think everyone has someone like that in their life. her and i agreed that as soon as i can nosh on food again we're going to buy a buttload of candy and then go and see the movie <b>saved!</b> which i've been waiting to see for forever. looks hilarious. 

kate called me too which was nice. she's been really good to me during this whole month. she's trying to put together a ceader point trip, which i doubt will work out but will be quite happy if it does. 

oh, and in the words of stewie from family guy 'and you, well i just plain don't like you'. that's dedicated to someone i tried to be nice to but have changed my mind."

"event","another rainy afternoon in little london. 

well, actually the weather has been pretty good...i think? i obviously don't get out too much - but by the looks of it the weather for the most part has been pleasent. 

it was weird - a week ago i went out on my first 'public appearance' as i like to call it. kate, rob, and i went to the drive-in and it was just bizarre to me because spring had really hit london finally. the flowers were blooming and the tree's had their colour back, it was just neat for me to be sort of welcomed back to the outside world with such pretty visuals. 

the drive-in was fun as per usual. rob is such a good guy, i know i rag on him a lot when he isn't around but he's so polite and just a really decent guy. i only say mean things when i get frustrated with kate's complaints. 

i'm slowly regaining my strength, s  l  o  w  l y...

i will be so thankful the day i don't have to drink another can of chocolate <b>boost</b>. i absolutely despise milk and anything with a milkesque taste so these meal replacement drinks are a bitch. i'm so tired all the time. my energy is so low that even taking a shower is difficult (hence why i don't take many, lol).

my face is...weird. i don't know. i'd hate to say this but i don't feel anymore prettier - but i do feel more confident. before when i would close my lips they would sort of purse, i was so self-concious about that...but now! tada, no more pucker lips. 

on friday i made plans to go see <b>shrek 2</b> with friends. i spoke to jessica earlier in the afternoon but for the rest of the day i heard nothing. ashley called around 8 to see if i wanted to go for pre-movie coffee with her and the others but my aunt and uncle had just come over so i decided to have them just pick me up before the movie. 

then around 9:15ish i hear the doorbell and my mom tells me 'your friends are here'. blargh. i was still in my bum clothing. i was like 'who's at my door?' and it was jessica and jamie! lol. we thought they weren't going because no one had heard from them but they were going to surprise me and kidnap me to the movies. we called ashley and then got things all planned. 

i sort of hate sort of first seeing people post-surgery. it is always sort of weird. jessica couldn't stop staring at me. lol. she said my profile had completely change. jamie said the difference is really noticable but i don't see it as much. i still have some swelling that needs to go down so my face has still got changes to make. 

the movie was hilarious by the way ('how many cats do you see wearing boots these days? honestly?'). 

i applied to western on friday thanks to rana. she came over and did everything for me. lol. i doubt i'll get in. i'm actually planning on not going to school at all next year - i refuse to go back to fanshawe unless i'm really into a program i can take there. i don't want to think about a future at western until i actually get in so for now i'm just thinking about full-time career. i don't want to waste anymore money. i'd much rather waste time. 

oh, i also got tickets to see john mayer and MAROON-FRIGGIN-FIVE for their show august 7th in toronto. maroon 5 are just the openning act and the only reason i'm spending 50 bucks on shit-tah seats. allison, whom i'm going with, gets back from her euro-trip this thursday. ashley and i saw her boyfriend sunday night at william's. it was funny. he looked at me and was like 'somethings different...did you get new braces?' lol. when he heard i couldn't speak that wonderfully he said 'wow, that's gotta be tough for you'. har har har. i'm surprised i didn't hear that line from people more. 

i had an ortho appointment this morning, he said my bite was fantastic. well, for the amount of money and pain it better be above average. lol. he said in 3 weeks i would feel a lot better than i do right now. i'm sort of in the middle stage, coming up on my one month anniversary this thursday. after that i have two weeks left until the possibilty of me eating solid food could become a reality. 

things aren't so bad now that i can open my mouth wide enough to get kraft dinner in there.      

my friend michelle is due to go into labour any day now. woah. that still blows my mind. having a baby at 20. i can safely say though that if there was any couple who could cope with this it would be her and ryan. 

oh, speaking of couples ashley and jeremy broke up. i was stunned. lol. she's gotten over it. then i get a phone call from carrie balling about how ian broke up with her. yikes. see what happens when i'm not around? chaos. it's been a few weeks now and she's not as depressed. she's rebounded with this creepy guy from work. whatever floats your boat i suppose. 

urgh, my head."

ahhh, the healing continues. i went and saw my surgen yesterday. it is so embarrassing for me to go out in public, i absolutely hate it. everyone stares, and i don't blame them - i would too, but still. anyway, my doctor said i was still pretty swollen (duh) but everything was moving along fine. he put a few elastics to help me find my bite. at first they hurt like a bitch but today they're fine. 

my swelling has gone down tons and tons, basically i'm waiting for feeling to return to my chin and lower lip. my cheeks are also numb but at least they aren't really swollen. the bruises are gone, thank goodness. they were the sickest colours. 

i can't really tell what my 'new face' is going to look like. it is so bizarre to only be getting bits and pieces. like my nose, it looks SO different. maybe it's just because i always hated my nose, but i love my nose now. it's so cute! it looks wider but it's all flat and just no bumps and stuff! 

my eyes freaked me out, they don't really have much character to them. like i always liked my eyes before - they were big and basically told everything and displayed every emotion, but now it's like eeeehhhh. what are they saying?! they always look mad. lol. they are definitely smaller, but today i was looking in the mirror and thought they didn't look too different. i can still find my old eyes. 

my lips are like the final piece of the puzzle, once those have swollen down to their natural look my face will be a face again. 

most people take 14 days to get over the worst of the swelling and today is day 12 so almost there. 

yesterday was a day full of love. in the morning brennan called me to see how i was doing. i kept telling him 'don't make me laugh!' and he totally made fun of how i was talking. :S i thought it was because i was so swollen, but now i think it's because of the way my teeth are sitting that i am having trouble speaking. i keep slurring! lol. 

then michelle, danielle, jessica, and emily called. i felt quite lucky. i tell people not to call me and they still do. 

rachel's been keeping me updated on the old navy life i'm missing out on. my manager luis called me this morning to see how i was feeling, thought that was nice of him to remember!

anyway, i am getting kind of dizzy so i'm going to go enjoy the bowl of sherbert my mom just brought in. 

oh, yeah. <B>I MISS FOOD</B>. especially french fries, shawarmas, chicken caeser salads, the kfc chicken skin, and popcorn!   

only a month to go of slop before i inhale half of london's food supply.

just an update to let you all know i'm not dead, though i was quite close to death apparently. lol. well, not really - well sorta actually. 

the operation went without a hitch. yeah, definitely cried like a baby before they wheeled me in, but who wouldn't have? i had my mom take a picture of me just before they wheeled me in. it is weird, when i look in the mirror i don't see myself, but i'm not scared or frightened by this stranger. i'm so swollen. urgh it is the worst. no pain, but having your face the size a mellon makes you wish you could have just been in pain instead! 

it's gone down a lot, but when i went to see the surgeron on monday morning he mentioned i was swollen way more than most cases, and here's why...

so i wake up really groggy in a room with what seems like 10 other patients. i can't really feel much, but i flick my tongue against my teeth and am completely shocked by how close my teeth are. no more overbite...ever. i don't remember much during the day, cept coughing while the nurses pushed me onto my left side. turns out a began to vomit blood. i passed out directly after or maybe even during my little throw-up session. i woke up who knows how much later and lay there looking around. my stomach begins to feel like it is nawing on itself. i cough a little, and suddenly the transparent plastic face mask i'm wearing is painted bright red with the blood i'm hacking out. all these nurses ran up next to my bed and started to push me onto my sides to get the blood onto the floor. it was seriously sick.

i passed out again and when i awoke once more i saw the doctors standing around me, but i couldn't hear them. i fell asleep and then when i woke up i was wheeled into a private room. i felt gross, but so tired that it didn't phase me. i don't remember most of the day, my mom spent most of the day by my bedside, my dad came later, and alison and her mom came for a bit but i was so drugged up i could barely stay awake during their visit. i slept basically every moment except when the nurses would come in. they taught me how to use my mouthwashes. while they were teaching me i began to throw up blood <i>again</i>. the nurses assured my parents that was normal, but i didn't think so. 

i got no sleep that night. i would sleep for 15 minutes, be up for 2 hours, sleep for 45 minutes, be up for 1 hour, it got really old fast.

the nurses came in around 6 to take some blood. i have the smallest viens ever and therefore getting blood taken out is the hardest process. jab jab jab. they left 6 holes in my right arm alone. :S 

the doctor came in and said i had to stay at the hospital for another day because a regular blood count is like, 120-130 and mine was 63. so technically i <i>could</i> have died (as kate pointed out, i didn't think about it at the time). 

so basically my low blood count is slowing down the process of perfect healing. i'm trying to force drinks down (how do people drink boost and ensure without a reason? that stuff is sick). i have no energy, all i want to do is lay around and sleep. 

i want the swelling to be over...that's honestly all i could wish for right now. 

definitely don't regret doing this, it is impossible to feel any regret. i tried, believe me. i just hate how swollen i ended up being. once the swelling goes down this will be a cakewalk. 

i don't miss food too much yet, let's hope that keeps up. 

what's nice is when stuff like this happens you realize how many people like you being around. haha. alison visited me both days i was at the hospital, kate and rob visited me the day i came home, ashley called me, michelle, lisa, allison e-mailed me. jessica called me and her and jamie came over (even though i specifcally asked them not to). my dad turned them away cause i was sleeping, but she brought me a von dutch hat! lol. not a real one, a fake one from the mini mart by her house. 

my room smells so pretty thanks to the <A TITLE=""Click for more information about flowers"" STYLE=""text-decoration: none; border-bottom: medium solid green;"" HREF=""http://search.targetwords.com/u.search?x=5977|1||||flowers|AA1VDw"">flowers</A> alison and kate gave me. ah, it is so nice. kate and rob bought me the shrek dvd so i could have something to entertain myself. aw. 

okay, typed enough. gonna go lay. 

thank you to everyone who commented and wished me good luck - so appreciate you all. :)"

"event","tomorrow is the <h3>big</h3> day. 

so tired. i stayed up until about two in the morning yesterday because i was sure there was a thunderstorm a brewin' but it never came. least not while i was awake. i woke up around 9:20 and decided to keep myself awake so i'll be able to get to bed early tonight. i'm hitting the sack directly after i watch series finale of the oc.

i saw <b>black eyed peas</b> monday. it was good. it was jason, lisa, rachel, and i. i didn't expect there to be so many older people there. we might have been among the youngest in the crowd. height is not to my advantage, therefore if i wanted to actually see any of the band i had to be on my tippiest tippy toe. i just watched the screen for most of the night. if the members in that band weren't such incredible dancers the concert would have been a bust. the girl, fergie - she's got incredible pipes. so all and all a good time, i'm glad i saw them, wish i had napped or something though before hand because i was so tired by the time they came back for their encore. 

can't stop yawning. 

kate organized a little ladies lunch-in in honour of my not being able to chew for six-weeks. brennan was suppse to come, but called me just as i stepped out of the shower telling me work had called him in. i was bummed, but he also owes me 40 dollars so i let him go work. rob, kate's boyfriend, was suppose to join us to but wasn't ready when we got their to pick him up. kate went in and came out of his house 15 minutes later in a huff. 'he'll meet us there' she told me, lindsay, and emily. he never ended up coming which made kate upset. but certainly not upset enough to break up with him because who would ever do that? 

we met up with lauren at <b>mandarin</b> and proceeded to wait for a table. it was pretty busy when we got there. it was so much fun, all of us at one time or another during the meal said 'i'm so glad we're got to hang out!' it was the camping crew back together. we all laughed over how crazy a time we all had. it was nice. 

the meal was excellent. who can beat all you can eat for 10 dollars? i got so full. but i made my double decker waffle, i was so proud. 'take a picture, i don't want to ever forget how beautiful it was.' 

everyone asked questions about my surgery. emily asked 'so what are the chances of death?' lmao. she was just being retarded.  

after that kate, lindsay, and i went to old navy to try on tube tops. definitely not my friend. i look like trash in them. i hate my boobs so much. something needs to be done about them. :S 

then we went to sea jewels and then we dropped lindsay off at her boyfriends house, 'eric the penis! eric the penis!' hahaha. we made up a song for her. 

that night i hung out with rana and rachel. we are the worst at figuring out things to do, honestly. we debate over movies for like 2 hours. we ended up just crashing at rachel's house and inhaling all of her food to which ranu didn't like after she realized how many rice cakes she had eaten. she's going to miami this weekend. i am so jealous. 

i haven't spoken to sara ann or adam lately. well, actually i spoke to adam for three seconds the other day but he had to go to work. i'll probably call sara before i go to bed tonight. 

last thursday i think the whole population of london bar-legal teens were out and about. g.t.'s had a line around the corner and down the block, barney's was packed, even the ceeps had a line. the only place with no line was jim bob's which proves my theroy that it bites. well, actually wednesday are jim bob's busy nights, thursdays for geets, and the weekend is anywhere you wanna be. so we, ashley, jessica, jamie and i, settled for tj baxter's rooftop patio. we got to see the most brutal fight outside of barney's. that was insane. 

the next day the four of us were planning on going to geets, but we were all so tired and the weather was gross so we went and saw <b>mean girls</b>, but we were late so we sat in the very front row which sucked but i'll see lohan anyway i can. haha. anyway, i loved the movie and can't wait to see it again. jamie even thought it was cool. at the end when we were walking out he and i were like 'lets count all of the boyfriends who were forced to come here! one, two...' the flick is definitely a tween movie. i didn't even think about it until ashley and jessica pointed out that we were probably the oldest people there and the only ones who could get into a bar legally out of the group. lol. i hate tweens. i hated myself as a tween. tweens are such fakers. 

i have to work today at 4. 4-7, not bad - but i would have prefered not to work at all on my last day before surgery. it hasn't hit me yet that my life is going to change. my ortho keeps wanring me everytime i go see him that 'though you maybe the same on the inside, the outside will look different and it will take a lot of time for those around you to feel comfortable with your new changes.' blah blah blah. i guess that worries me a little, i mean i know i can handle the change - i've been praying for it, but what about the people around me? i guess we'll wait and see. 

monique left me a message yesterday, she thought i had my surgery already. it was so cute. 'i hope you're okay! do you wanna watch friends together!? call me if you can talk!' :) 

alright, wish me luck. if your up around 8 am tomorrow, think of me because that's when they'll be putting me under. i'm not sure when i'll be feeling up to updating again so see ya for now dah-lings.

ciao,

<lj-cut text=""'i was like ricki you're rad!'"">
</center>
friday i went to geets (or g.t.'s) with rachel and lisa. it was a celebration of lisa being done quizzno's, rachel getting accepted to u.w.o, and me being just about my first year of post-secondary. we started off in the basement listening to the liveband (which wasn't the usual cover band!) i was so ready to let loose, it had been a good couple of weeks since my last trip downtown. i yelped and woo'd to the music, but i was so thrilled when they started to play 'calling all angels' by train because that song has got to me one of my top five all time favourites. they changed the lyrics though so i looked like the fool! lol. 

ahhhh, i was working the 'i'm rad, you're rad, let's hug' paul frank tee i bought. definitely a good investment! :D hahaha. i love hugs! 

lisa decided it was time to go dancing maybe 20 minutes after getting down there. we ventured up to the dancefloor and let loose. of course i attract only the creepiest people in the whole bar. yeesh. it was funny though. this really sketchy guy was like right behind me for like 5 minutes and i just turned around and was like 'what are you doing? are we dancing?' and he's like 'yeah we can dance!' so i was like 'whatever, this will be a funny story later' and dance with him. now it is fine as long as the guy is behind me, but when they turn me around to look at them i hate it. i decided to try and scare him off so i went nuts like flailing myself around and then flopping into him like i was 'so wasted'. hahaha. he ended up 'accidently' spilling his drink down my pants!! lol. i screamed and pushed him 'you jerk! you spilt your drink down my underwear!' to which he replied 'you're fucked' and left me alone! lisa and rachel were laughing when i returned to them. we spent most of the night dancing. it was more of rachel and i dancing our asses off and lisa just kinda bopping around. she wasn't really drunk enough to enjoy dancing i guess and she was also pretty tired.

so after dancing for forever we went back downstairs because lisa looked really unenthused. i saw my friend jason there which was funny and he bought me and lisa lots of free drinks! we all talked and the band played on all the great hits. i dunno, it wasn't exactly the most group fun night ever, but it was really fun for me personally. 

ahaha, and when we were walking back to rachel's car we walked by a taxi and i thought i heard a guy say 'you need a ride?' and we all ignored it and kept walking and then i turned around to see that the guys in the taxi were <i>still</i> watching us so i slapped my rear and said 'you got something for me to ride big boy?' and he goes 'oh yeah - i picked you!' i'm like 'cool?' and turn around and then rachel and lisa were like 'they asked if we were working!' and i'm like 'oooh like hookers?' me being slow i don't realize until a moment later that 'hey!! they think i'm a hooker?!' well obviously they were joking but i was like 'i'm wearing the most clothing! why am i the pro ho?' 

ahahaha, it was a funny night for me and rachel, but i think lisa has more fun when she's a little drunker which i hate typing cause i think only having fun when your drunk is so silly, but in this case it was true. 
</lj-cut>
<center><lj-cut text=""'thank you for calling old navy'""></center>

the next day i had to work at old navy 2:00 until 11:00. yeah, it does suck as bad as it sounds. but it was such a good shift because i got to work with all my favourite people and luis bought me dinner from wendy's! ahhh, sometimes i feel so lucky to work there. plus emily came in and made me laugh with her random comments 'okay, so where is the free stuff?' 'my favorutie shirt is the one that says american idol!' - i am so embarassed we sell those.  
</lj-cut>
<center><lj-cut text=""'baby showers and karoke queen's'""></center>

sunday was the big baby shower for michelle! ashley met me at old navy and we shopped for some baby clothing. we all chipped in and got her a play pen that she put in her registry, but we all also got individual gifts too. i found some really cute outfits AND a trucker hat 'i'll just buy a 0-6 month sized one cause i think that's how much longer they will be hip.' 

we got there an hour late cause we are all fools! haha. did i mention they all looooooooove my driving oh so much? i didn't? prolly cause they don't. especially momo. she gets so nervous! i kept saying 'relax, we're fine!' so much that allison was like 'if you say that one more time...' hahaha. 

there were so many people and i didn't know who to introduce myself to first and what to say in my little introduction!? luckily we got there just minutes before it was present opening time which took two hours. lol. michelle kept saying as she opened the gifts 'why are you people spending all this money? you shouldn't have!' and i was like 'michelle, love has no price tag!' and everyone laughed! hehehehe. actually i was on a huge roll yesterday. zingers coming left and right. it is the neatest thing to make people you don't even know laugh. 

everyone was like 'nadine, what would we do without you?' and i was like 'be really quiet.' i account for 80% of the dialouge in the group afterall. michelle thinks i should be paid to go sit in the corner of parties and just say shmarmy comments all night to entertain people. that would be quite the job. 

carrie loved the birthday gift michelle and i got her which was a total bonus and her thankfulness was so sincere! roxanne was there wearing one of the shirts i bought her for her birthday and she was also using the wallet i got her - double score. we kept talking about her and alec and how they are going to get married. she kept saying 'i have to tell nadine things cause we're family'. i guess she's moving out next week which proves how little i see her cause i had no idea! 

people wanted to go out that night, but not to honest lawyer as per usual. i said 'let's go to molly bloom's! we can do some karoke!' and ashley got so excited! i was able to get the car so i picked up jessica and jamie (and didn't get lost finding my way there!) they were crazy rummies! 

me: jamie what song are you going to sing?
jamie: it's raining men!
jess: halleyluuah!!!

lmao.

i totally made jessica crap herself when i pulled a U-eee and was all over the side walk! hahaha. jamie had faith in me! 

so we went to harvey's to pick up ashley cause she was dropping the car off for her sister and we were on our way. we showed up at molly's around 10:30, half an hour late. carrie, ian, michelle, and ryan were no where to be found! so we grabbed the usual booth and the drinks began to flow. lol. ashley and i kept saying 'drink up your courage juice so you'll be brave to sing!' cause i was sure one of us would sike out! we kept bugging the waitress about when the karoke was gonna begin and she said it was running late! :P it got set up around 11:30 and ashley and i grabbed a book and signed up for the duet 'don't go breaking my heart' by elton john and kiki dee! i was elton! 'you the man!' 

when i went to go give my little sign up sheet to the guy i saw aaron of all people! he looks SO different! i LOVE him. hahaha. i was like 'omg you have a beard!?' it's like really scruffy! i told him i was going to dedicate my song to him and i told him not to boo if we sucked. he laughed at my hyperness asking 'how many drink have you had?'

around 12:15 the guy called 'ashley and nicole' to the stage! lol. we went up and the stupid television screen was so hard to read so we basically were singing the chorus over and over! it was the funniest moment of the past 4 months! lol. ashley was like 'did you hear those drunko's boo us?' 'no!!' we just laughed even harder. apparently they were like 'you suck!' which even right now makes me tear up from laughter! jessica and jamie took pictures to prove we actually sang! jamie kept yelling 'take off your shirt!!'  

you'd think we would have retired our career as karoke queen's but oh no! we wanted our solo's! i signed up to do 'yellow' by cooooooooldplay while ashley signed up to sing 'hit me with your best shot'!

we kept waiting and waiting for our names to be called, but we think he kept moving them to the bottom of the pile! hahaha. jamie and jessica were so cute! they couldn't get their hands off one another. jessica and him were like 'we'll be right back' ashley and i were like okay! so we were talking to the guys behind us 'we have 18 inch cocks!' 'actually did you know that the largest recorded penis is only 10 inches?' '......oh.' and just laughing and enjoying the fine pro ho dancing going on when ashley was like 'where did jessica and jamie go? it has been like 15 minutes!' they sauntered back to the table a few minutes after we noticed their lengthy absence! jessica's hair was a mess 'you could have at least combed your hair before you came back you slut.' jamie was like 'i like it messy!' 'i bet you do!' 

it was funny/awkward because they kept randomly making out and ashley   i would always seem to look over when they would start! the guys behind us took pictures of them! jessica got pissed and was like 'do something!' to jamie 'do you want me to go get my ass kicked?' ashley and i were like 'we want a jamie!' i go:

me: jessica you are beautiful, you have a good education, a loving family, you have two cats, and now you have a boyfriend who voluntarily gives you back rubs - i hate you.
ashley: yeah me too!
jamie: i like you. 

lol. 

SO ANYWAY around 1:30 they finally call ashley and i up. 'i'm doing this one for chris martin!' lol. i was so not even nervous which was great. probably because jamie, jess, and ashley were all standing right in front cheering! while i was singing i noticed a couple were like slow dancing and when i got close to the end the guy swooped the girl up in his arms rocking her around the floor. i was like 'awww!' when i was done the girl ran up to me and said 'that was our wedding song! thank you so much for singing that! what a wonderful memory!' i was like tearing up cause i thought that was so beautiful and she gave me the nicest hug and lead me over to her hubby who also gave me a hug! they were young too, they couldn't have been wed too long! ahhh so that totally made my life! i thought that was so amazing how me singing that song could make a moment for them! i hope i didn't suck! hahaha. 

ahhh, we are so going back next weekend. i'm thinking my next song will be 'calling all angels' or 'la song'! ashley and i kept saying 'this was one of the coolest nights ever! this is going down in our mental history!' 

:)

on the 2 and a half hours of sleep i had managed to get last night i got up at 8 am to be ready for a day of surgery prepping. i will be on a liquid diet for 6 weeks. that's over 760 hours with no solid, tasty food. i am so screwed. it's a price you have pay though, right?"

"event","definitely a busy and interesting few days! 

today was my final day of college classes. wow. insane. we made it guys (for those of us who had to go through first year post-secondary). it is so bizarre to read entries i made in september. i'm so not even that girl anymore, defined by those around her. i'm finally my own definition. 

<b>two very short weeks</b> until surgery day. had to book my physical (which scares me more than the surgery itself) 

i've been searching online for sites related to jaw surgery. i found one site made by a guy who basically told the whole story of his surgery, beginning to end. it was so helpful to me to read. i found out they don't wire your jaw shut, but there will be a weird appliance they put in there to help you get use to the new bite. he said learning to chew again was hard. i've been trying to eat with my jaw forward - it is so hard! lol. 

kate and i hung out yesterday (minus brennan - i'll explain). i showed her pictures of what they do. i get it now. it makes sense now that i see it. i'll have this like hinge thing - i'll post a picture maybe if anyone cares to see an example. kate was like 'you're gonna set off alarms where ever you go!' hahahaha i never thought of that. 'oh, just the metal screws in my jaw!' eh, guess that isn't that funny. :P 

so i called brennan yesterday and he sounded <i>so</i> depressed. 'prolly trouble in paradise' concluded kater. i don't know what it is. he said he was just 'tired of everything'. i can understand that. the guy hasn't really been able to catch his breath for the last few months. i hope he's okay. he sounded so weird. so different. 

this is sort of a decent segway - i've been talking to matt a lot more lately on msn. he seems to always be on when i am (which is almost never - i'm so over im, haha)! we were talking and he was like 'anything fun and exciting i should know about?' 'uh, i'm getting jaw surgery!' hahaha, omg you guys must think i tell everyone - cause i do. so we were talking about it and he was like 'so i won't even recognize you!' 'nooope' and he works at chapters so i said: 

me: i'll come into chapters and find you and be like 'can you show me the backstreet boy books?' 
me: and then i'll be like 'you know you look just like nick carter.' 
him: and then i'll be like 'how would you like that sweet muslim ass spanked?!' 

lmao. he makes me laugh. 

me: guess who i talked to today? 
him: allah?

hahaha. 

oh, so today ashley, allison, monique, and i went for lunch. it was good! haven't seen miss alley in weeks. i love laughing and with them it is constant. my jokes always seem to work. :) we all also got siked because we're planning on going camping in june. ah, i love camping. there is something about sleeping outside that i just find so absolutely peaceful. 

anyway, we lunched and then i drove momo home cause she had work and then went back to the mall where i found allison, ashley, and jessica - who was meeting up with us there. we went and checked out the play pen that we're all going in on as a gift for michelle's baby shower which is this sunday. turns out the one michelle requested on her registry wasn't in stock. :S so we're going back on sunday to get it. 

and of course this went on my credit card! fack, i'm really worried. lol. oh, well actually not that worried because remember how i said i ordered tiffany and co bracelet and necklace set? yeah, got the bracelet and it was so FAKE. i was pissed. the people put up a fake picture. i've e-mailed them a couple times and still no response. the necklace looked like it could have been real, but when i asked my brother (becuase i knew his friends would probably have it since their all quite trendy like that) if it was real he said definitely not. so i sent it back today and the guy is giving me a refund so there is some cash coming back to me. phew. hopefully i'll be able to send the bracelet back and get a refund. 

plus, my online banking is so slow. it like adds transactions like 3 days after i do them. it's hard for me to keep track! 

one thing i'm going to do as soon as my credit card is under 50 smackers is get subscriptions to <b>seventeen</b> and <b>teen people</b> magazine. 

so anyway, we started off in <B>american eagle</b> and i was looking at the jewelry and they got new stuff in including this gorgeous leather cuff that's detailed with flowers. so so beautiful, but $18.50!? for that? jessica, ashley, and i were like talking about shoplifting and stuff and jessica told us she has been convicted for shop lifting twice. lmao. ashley's a bit of a clepto herself and i've had a history of five finger discounts (which all ends in me feeling guilty and throwing the items out or putting them back. hahaha.) so anyway we leave and once we are pretty far away i pull the bracelet out of my purse, quite impressed that i had just gotten away with theft. i forgot what a rush it was to steal. ashley and jessica were like 'oh my god!!' 'i didn't even see you do it! you are good!' ashley was like 'high fives to that'. at first i was like 'well i'll just give 20 dollars to charity and that will be my way of justifying this.' but allison was like 'nadine you shouldn't have done that' blah blah. so i started to feel REALLY bad. like 'you are so going to hell' bad. was it really worth it?! 

so after i dropped allison off at loblaws and sent more money off to my credit card i went back to american eagle and went up to a couple of staffers that were my age and said 'okay, this is weird but i just stole this and i feel really bad so i'd like to pay for it.' hahahaha. honest to goodness those were the words that came out of my mouth. i know you guys must be thinking 'you are so dumb' but what were they gonna do? i admitted to it. honesty is the best policy! the girl was like 'thanks for being honest' 'uuh, well i shouldn't have stolen it in the first place'. to be 100% honest i really just returned it because i know i won't get away with it, karma will get my ass. i was so scared that something would end up happening to me during surgery or the surgery might get post-poned as a sort of karma police type action. i couldn't risk that happening! lol. 

so now i own this pretty lil' cuff and have a story to tell for it too! :)

my hair looks like crappy mcpooh. i'm so pissed at that lady for ruining it so many months back. it is taking forever to grow. i just want my pretty hair back! :S i have to straighten it if i wanna wear it down because when it is curly and down it looks radonkulous. 

we no longer own a honda civic. the lease expired this week i think. my brother's new choice of car? some psycho acura. i have never seen anything so euro chic. it is okay, but i definitely prefered the civic. this has that sleak kinda look to it. it's hard to explain. i think it is ugly, but a lot of people own it or cards like it so whatever.

"event","happy monday everyone! completely forgot it is an <b>oc</b> night. hooray! 

did you know there not one, but <i>two</i> communities dedicated to my hometown? that's bizarre. i always think i'm the only livejournal owner from l-dot, but i found a bunch of people who call the forest city home! crazy. 

my english prof handed back our essays this morning. 85%, i am incredible. lol. i am so proud of that mark since i completely made up the essay. glad to hear i can bullshit my way through most college-related situations. then i had my final marketing test, dun dun dun. did i study? hell no. but i knew just enough to get me 71%. so i've earned a B in that course which is what i was aiming for. B's are attainable when i only try a little bit. imagine if i actually tried? A's across the board. i'm not sure i'm going to get any A's like last semester (still can't believe i got an A in my essay writer's class!). i am confident that i got B's in english, marketing, and creative writing. as for psych and music history - we shall see. mostly for psych. it all comes down to how i do on this last test. 

so i have an 'exam' type test tomorrow in english and then two exams next week and then the chapter of my life that is college is finished. crazy. i'm kind of glad to have it over and done with. i liked this semester. i'm not sure if i liked it more than first though. i had more inclass friends this semester, but i had more interesting courses last time around. today was the last time i would see caroline. :( like i said we were writing a test in marketing and she finished before me. she was like 'i'm just going to hug nadine!' to the prof and came over and gave me a cuddle telling me 'i'll miss you!' it was sad our goodbye had to be so short but it meant a lot to me. she was a character. lol. 

saturday night rachel, lisa, and i got together at my house. rachel and i went to blockbuster since lisa decided to rollerblade to my house (which is really really really far away). we picked <b>trainspotting</b>. about time i say this movie. the first half was kind of crappy, but the last bit was pretty good. they are both kind of into the same kind of movies i am currently enjoying so it was nice to watch it with them. 

then sunday night monique and i finally got together. i feel so good when i'm hanging around her. i dunno what it is. maybe it's her red hair! i was like 'omg mo, did they not feed you?! look at your face!' i squshed her cheeks as i examined. we went to <B>prince albert's diner</b> and i got these nasty perogies. blargh. then we went to dairy queen cause i was hankering a treat of some kind. it was really busy! we decided to do drivethrough. i changed my order 5 times. lol. first i wanted skor, then cookie dough, then chocolate extreme, then oreo, and finally i settled on crispy crunch which by that time the girl was just like 'get lost!' hahaha. momo enjoyed that classic moment. 

then we got back to her house and sat on her deck and talked until we were done our ice cream. then we went for a walk around the block. once we got back to her house we sat in her room and listened to music and had a little girl talk.

oh, this is sort of amusing. we were walking back to my car and we passed <b>jim bob's</b>, the only bar i have yet to venture to. i was like 'i haven't been there yet!' and mo goes 'neither have i!' and i was like 'let's go in!' and we walk up the steps. the door was open a crack, but there was a cop and a couple of other guys standing there talking so we were like 'eeehhhh' back away slowly...so we're going to go as soon as i'm all healed up.

i had a dream yesterday that it was my surgery day and it felt so real. i was shitting my pants. lol. i realized that i'm actually really frightened of waking up after the surgery and just having my face all swollen. plus, i mean how weird is it going to be when i wake up and my jaw is all different! like my cousin (who had the same operation done) told me it freaked him out that his teeth were touching (like his lower and upper front rows of teeth - when you've got an overbite they obviously don't touch...), he couldn't get use to it for awhile. yikes. i keep moving my lower jaw forward and keeping that way for as long as i can to help me get use to it. 

it's like 17 more days. holy shit. 17 more days of being 'this' girl. that's it. in a snap i'm going to look like someone else. or not, but most likely i will have a pretty big change. 

ashley called me saturday and told me one of her friends who had gotten it done told her 'i hope your friend is mentally prepared because it takes a huge toll on you emotionally. i didn't even recognize who i was.' even his girlfriend couldn't see any similarities. 

sorry, i've been told i talk about this too much - but you would be too if you were me. this is a huge deal. something i've wanted for the last decade is finally here. 

anyway, onto other topics...i called adam! but being a doof, i by accidently called his cellphone and he couldn't hear me very well and he was like 'why are you calling my cellphone?!' hahaha. he was just leaving to somewhere so we only spoke for like 3 seconds so i was all sarcastic 'okay! nice talking to you then!' 'yeah! you too!' lol.  

brennan and i spoke today. i was just calling his cellphone to see if he had a machine so i could leave a message for him to call me, but he picked up the phone! he's back at home now due to come complications. i had no idea what happened to him. yesterday when mo and i were driving downtown i thought i saw him rollerblading. it looked <i>just</i> like him. i yelled at this guy 'BRENNAN?!' haha. i was like 'oh mo, what if he's homeless?! what if he's rollerblading to no where? should we go pick him up?' good thing i didn't cause it wasn't him. 

brennan and i were gonna have an oc party, but because of my test tomorrow i rescheduled to wednesday. 

then today michelle and i went shopping for carrie's birthday gift. it was carrie's b-day on saturday and people were going out, but it was all couples! lol. so i was like 'ehhhh, no thanks.' i need to find a boyfriend to hang out with all of them now. i'm so not being the 'group single'. so anyway, michelle and i went to westmount so we could get her something from <b>sea jewels</b>, love that store. we kept finding the most perfect stuff, and then it would be 296 dollars. wtf?! lol. we finally settled on a cute pink diamond pendent. definitely looks like something she would wear. hope she likes it. 

of course this purchase went on the old credit card! hahaha. oh god, i've lost track of how much money i'm spending. eek. i am scared to get the bill. i'm sure it's under 100. no more ebay until i get the bill! hahahaha. brennan and i were talking about my ebay addiction and i was like 'tell me something you want' and he mentioned this dvd series and i went and was like 'just say the word brennan! i can get it!' and he's like 'no! don't bid!' and i was like 'please let me push that button!!' hahaha. oh how tragic. 

it was seriously the most beautiful day today. yeehaw for t-shirt weather days! keep them coming mama nature.

"event","i've been really giggily these past few days. i've been around the right people and been thinking about the right things. plus all this sunshine and warmth we've been spoiled with the last few days is definitely helping re-kindle my souls small flame...

yesterday when i was driving i rolled down my window and <b>save tonight</b> by eagle eye cherry came on. it was nothing but open road infront of me and greenlights met me every step of the way. it was a really relaxing drive home that had me smirking most of the time. smirking is sort of a sign when i've figured something out and am okay with it.

<i>tomorrow comes with one desire, to take me away...</i> 

i had to work yesterday, but it was a really good night regardless of the fact that it was a closing shift. it was jessica, grace, anne, brittney, and myself most of the time. i was like 'what's everyone's favourite movie? what are your favourite bands?' it was nice to learn more about everyone. i like it when people ask me what my favourite band is cause then i get to gush about how fantastic i think coldplay are. go ahead, call me silly... 

kate came in to visit me and do a little shopping. i had a nice chat with her and her mom. she got her hair dyed back to her original colour, it looks so good. 

i think i might call adam tonight. haven't talked to that southern soul in awhile. 

kate and i talked tuesday for a bit and we got to tripping down memory lane. specifically may two-four (which is holly's birthday if i remember correctly! lol. but besides that...) canadian's will know what i'm refering too. anyway, two years ago - my first time camping ever - it was probably a record chill but we were psycho enough to stick it out till the very end. i kept thinking about how emily and lauren drank all the orange juice and kate and i got so pissed and were like 'that's for everyone and you finished the whole jug in one night!' we made them go buy another jug when we went to the local IGA. then kate and i never ended up drinking any. lol. ahhh, it's just funny cause when i did drink some the morning we were leaving emily was like 'are you enjoying your orange juice? drink it up!' lol. it's only funny cause of the way she says it. 

then last year when i tried to cook the dinner and dropped the burgers into the fire. lmao. omg. kate was like 'and that's why i'm the cook!' 

or the first night when it was just lindsay, kate, and i and these arab guys kept going 'hey high school girls come here!' cause we were in our tent being dorks and screaming. 'hark - thar she blows!' 

i remember the days when walking down to the mini mart that's like 5 minutes away was a whole friday night adventure. lol. so classic. 

or the trips to see the backstreet boys live. especially trip numero uno. hiding cameras down our pants! yes, we were desperate!

going cosmic bowling every weekend in grade nine. well, maybe not every weekend - but it felt like it. 

ahahaha new years 1999 'don't drink a lot of beer cause you wouldn't want to die in the new year'.

shopping with helen. we bought some really stupid stuff. or the time when she said 'i'll never get my period!' and the next day she got it. lol. 

making the band nights. oh dear God the joy.   

canada's wonderland, the first time when it was kate, lauren, simmy, and i. i remember being stuck in traffic...kate swore and the people beside us eyed her evilly. lauren laid back and put her feet out the window. simmy and i were in the back listening to the cd in my discman.     

i like remembering specific moments like that. like a frame of time that you remember so well you can just re-live it by closing your eyes. 

like the first time we went camping we went intown to get some last minute food and we were walking out of the IGA and there were like teenagers and college/university folk all over the place. a truck with girls in the back zoomed by as they hollared at the boys 'hey baby!' as they filmed everyone. everyone around just made a big 'woo!' lol. it was such a funny moment and i remember knowing i would remember it. i dunno why that moment makes me smile when it really has nothing to do with me...you know what i mean? 

it's just the vibe i guess. the feeling i got from that situation was a really positive one...

<i>...let's delay our misery</i>

okay, that's enough of that wouldn't you agree? 

how good was <b>the oc</b> last night? it's the first episode to make me cry. i watched it today since i was forced to miss it due to work. i can't believe luke is gone. i totally felt for his character the whole episode. i was like 'why won't someone be his friend?!' i would have had his back. so he slept with his ex-girlfriend's mother...there are worse things i can think of! hahaha. yeah. 

and ryan + marissa back together? that came from nowhere. but i was happy! :D yay! <-- happy, see? 

haha seth crying in the movie - humourous. and he was sporting a <u>paul frank</u> tee through most of the episode. i love a man in paul frank! and summer was wearing my 'wink wink' shirt from american eagle. well i shouldn't say it's mine - but i love it and owned it for a short period of time before i returned it again cause it looked really super stupid on me.  

lmao. the hand signals between seth and summer? come on - you laughed too! or when summer asked if she had been mean to seth and he said 'no, cause for you to be mean would mean you talked to me...' i was like <i>crack</i> - there goes my heart. 'i guess a lot can change in one year' - amen, ain't that the truth.

and at the end when marissa walked into her room and she was so happy? awww...

the whole episode just makes me all 'yay for friends' like. 

i love <b>ebay</b> because it's like i have mail everyday! lol. yesterday i got my 'true love' paul frank shirt that i have wanted forever (and bonus - seth cohen sported the man version of it once on a episode of the oc) and i got a letter from <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sailormaxx"" targer=""new"">sara</a> who i've been bugging to draw me a picture cause i know she's amazing at drawing and all things art-related. my mouth hit the floor when i saw the picture <b>THANK YOU</b>! when i should my mom she was like 'oh my gosh! that's incredible!' you are truly talented little lady! :D

yay for payfreakin' day my friends. paid of the old credit card today. nice to be clean of debt - now back to more ebaying. 

poopoo i'm on my period and feel like inhaling a chocolate bar - i'm gonna go grab some goodies from the gas station to help me through these trying times."

"event","it's been a highly emotional couple of days, for good reason. i'm never upset or constantly regreting after heated conversations. i'm usually really glad that they happened. i'm just tired and would love school to be over and done with. 

today i went to my pop culture class to see some of the other student presentations. one group did their's on fight club - it was so good. they had movie clips and music but the video kept screwing up so it didn't have the impact it should have had, but still that's creative. they'll probably get the best mark. 

then the other group going did it on noam chivensky (i think that's his name...) it was pretty good. kind of boring for me since i don't know much about the whole business political end of things. 

anyway, the fight club presentation mentioned buy labels and conforming and how individuality is dead blah, blah, blah. that really rubs me the wrong way when i hear that. i hate it when people rag on others who wear labels. if you have a person who buys only gap clothing, they aren't any less of an individual. i think it is a cop out to say 'indivuality is dead because of labels'.  

i decided to say something. i raised my hand and mumbled 'this isn't as much of a question as it is a comment...' and i proceeded to explain my idea that people who wear labels aren't any less unique and any less of an interesting person. i felt like an ass cause i'm wearing my von dutch hat and knew everyone was kind of thinking about that and i said 'i bought this hat because i like it, not because a celebrity has it. i like the colours! i like the design! it happens to be popular - oh well, that's not my problem.' 

oh, class debate begins. first big one all semester. 

i was surprised when people agreed with what i was saying - especially when most of them were guys. most of the girls in the class that actually wore labels didn't say much. except for one girl who i didn't even recognize - i had never seen her in the class. she was going off and saying 'you're buying these labels, promoting freely for them. they should be paying you!' i said 'you don't know why i bought this hat.' 

she then said something like 'so you can swear that the fact that britney spears wear's that hat had nothing to do with buying it?'

'uh, i can safely say that britney spears wearing a von dutch hat does not make me want it.' 

the class laughed which is always nice.

then she told me i 'obviously conformed' which pissed me off <i>so</i> bad. 'i conformed? you're the one telling me i conformed! isn't that something i would know for myself? you are already placing me in catergories. you clearly think i bought this hat for superficial reasons and you think i listen to or idolize britney spears. it's people like you that try and make people feel bad for wanting or buying something with a name on it. if i'm conforming to labels you are conforming to being anti-label.'  

guys in the class were starting to chant 'fight, fight, fight...' lol. it felt so good to get some anger out and to have an audience was a bonus. 

i'm not trying to make friends in that class, i've only seeing them 3 more times before i am basically erased from their memories. 

i will forever stick up for people who want to buy labels. it doesn't make them any less unique then anyone else. everyone else thinks people who wear labels are just easier to guess cause they have a more noticable 'cover' to their storybook. no one would ever guess my secrets...

she thought i liked britney spears? yeesh. lol. 

the prof says 'i hate to stop this because this is pretty interesting and the most talkative we've all been but class is over!'  

i grabbed my bag and waltzed out and these girls turned to me and said 'isn't that other girl annoying? she has no idea what she's talking about...' i just shrugged 'she's just an much entitled to her opinion as i am to mine. i'm just not going to let her's sound better then mine.' they laughed and i walked up the stairs away from them. those particular girls wear 'label' stuff too (the nice upper-class label stuff ugg boots, guess shirts, armani bags, etc...) so that's probably why they were suddenly interested in talking to me cause i was defending them in a way.

blah. i'm not saying <i>everyone be so amazed by my candid ability to argue</i>, this is just something i don't get to do everyday so it was cool.

one guy mentioned the show <i>i want a famous face</i> that's on mtv. for those who don't know about it the basic concept is regular people get (sometimes extensive) plastic surgery to look like celebrities. i've only seen one episode (the brad pitt twins), it was pretty interesting. yes, these people are paying to look like someone else - but i still think that what their doing shouldn't be called conforming.

i hate that word...conforming...blah. i'm not going to lie - i conform a little. we're all guilty of that. but when someone tells me i'm living my life by it, gah. i'll bite yew. 

look at me, i'm totally into trendy labels - tiffany and co, louis vuitton, von dutch, etc... BUT that shouldn't mean that i am some predicatable twit that is controlled by the media (hello, i am in marketing - i know the tricks of the trade! lol...). i'm unique. no one dresses like me, no one dresses like you, we're all ourselves and no one can copy that.

oh yeah, <b>Igby Goes Down</b> was a pretty good movie. it's weird though because if someone asked me to explained it i would be like 'uhh...' it is more complex then the description on the back of the video gives it credit for. my favourite scene was when amanda peet goes to the restaurant to see jeff goldbloom's character. absolutely, hands down. completely had my heart wretched for her. she did an excellent job in this film. 

i have a free 'old favourite' movie rental that expires this weekend. i'm not sure what i'm going to rent. anyone have any good suggestions? as of now i'm thinking <b>24 Hour Party People</b> or <b>Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her</b>.

oh one more thing, <b>the swan</b> is such a great show and anyone who puts those girls down for wanting what they got are silly. i completely see myself in these women. it is so weird and so great that this show has come out so close to my surgery because it's helping me deal and realize things. it also humbles me a lot, i'm just getting one little operation - these women are getting completely made over. i keep thinking my changes will be huge, but now i realize maybe i'm just over thinking things. 

my favourite part is the reveal at the end. i always cry. especially when one girl said 'all i've ever wanted was to be beautiful.' it's like taking my words and feelings right out of my heart."

"event","i guess i should have known all along
not even you thought i was strong
guess i really knew right from wrong
wonder what the fuck took so long

<i>all in all it was a pretty nice day...</i>

yesterday, before all my personal drama and anguish began, sara ann and i had a good phone conversation. whenever i talk to her i'm always like 'why can't i be there already.' i want to see her so badly that it's beginning to hurt. 

her and adam are so alike in their ways of making me feel. i constantly laugh with them and frankly that's more priceless then any other type of outword emotion i can think of. 

her: how have you been? how's the real girl?
me: she's good, its been a really good month! 
her: no crying?
me: only once cause my sister's a hoe.

it's almost like i should have known i jinxed everything. things were going so well this month that i completely neglected my writings. the last proper entry made in my journal was March 7th. i didn't have anything worth writing. no one likes to read 'everything is great' 50 times over.  

<i>no, you don't know me but i know you, you're my favourite star</i>

i started work today at 8 am, perfect. i barely slept last night. i maybe got 3 hours...

when i looked at myself in the mirror this morning my eyes had a rouge puffiness to them and my hair was all frizzed out from my tossing and turning.

it was so weird because all through the night thoughts flooded my mind, i wanted to talk to someone so bad. sara left to greg's so i couldn't call her, adam would have definitely been in bed by then, and anyone else i could think of wouldn't have understood what i needed from them. especially at that awkward of a time.   

but the weird part was when i did actually sleep, for the breif few hours...the alarm work me up around 7:25 and i felt so empty. so completely cleansed. i suddenly had no anger left in me. i couldn't even think about what it was that made me so upset.

<i>but it's the only way to bring me back</i>

lisa and i had a pretty good conversation on friday...she's so...different now. i feel guilty. i feel like i do to her the exact same things i'm afraid people will do to me. 

she seems like she's gotten a lot wiser...she's thinking inwardly more. or at least i'm aware of it now. i hope this summer is good for her. i hope it's good for everyone. 

<i>i'm so ugly, but that's okay cause so are you...</i>

sometimes i think i'm the words biggest baby. constantly whining. look, i'm writing in a journal i very well know three people read that will most likely feel guilty...or not. actually, it's extremely doubtful they would feel guilt. they'll feel anger if anything. <i>wah wah wah. another cry for attention</i>. this is very well known to me, yet i write this anyway. i don't care what they think. or maybe i do. no, no...at this point i don't anymore. 

we're all so different and i think we all grew into really unique girls. i don't think any of us regret knowing one another or leaving one another. it was what had to be done. if it wasn't right, we all would be friends right now.

<i>a restless body cracks some more</i>

i rented a movie, <b>igby goes down</b>. rachel mentioned it in her journal the other day and it reminded me that i did at one point want to see that movie and i have the time to see it right now so i will.

a movie i really want to see if <b>saved</b> which people who have seen <b>eternal sunshine of the spotless mind</b> will know. i heard about it a long time ago, but never actually have seen a real preview of the movie. it looks hilarious. ah, laughter. the soul's best medicine they say... 

<i>you were busy writing your tradegy</i>

i no longer refer to my loblaws friends as work friends...they are my friends. especially jessica. it's weird how close we've become. ashley too. her and i have a lot in common. 

old navy people are work friends now, if i'm lucky some of them will be my friends one day too.

<i>Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now, when I need you
Alone on an aeroplane
Fall asleep on against the window pane
My blood will thicken

I need to wash myself again to hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
But who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking this low?

My baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends, no, no, no

Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the CIA, the tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away, to blow me sky high

My baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends

I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be part of the human race
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be part of the human race, race, race, race

Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?</i>

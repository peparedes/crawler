"event","Doesn't anyone update their blog these days?  When I was young, I'd walk seven hours through the snow uphill both ways just to write an entry.  Sheesh!


Interested in helping me out in my next career?  If you are a former Muse staff member (or a high school or college person who loves to write and hopefully, is also good at it), <a href=""mailto:revans95@bellsouth.net"">email me</a> to find out how. It could mean fame, fortune, and a new line on your resume.  Also potted meat."

"event","It's been awhile since I posted, but gee whillikers I've been busy, busier than anyone can imagine, busier than I've been in seven years of teaching. It takes a lot to get nineteen people ready to go to New York City, which we on the Muse staff are doing TOMORROW, and continue to teach at one's very best ability.  I'm very sad that I haven't kept up with my LJ reading as I'm not sure exactly what's been going on in everyone's life, but it seems as though things have hovered near status quo.  

I'm supposed to be packing but I've become distracted by loading my muvo with music for the journey.  I'm trying to imagine the auditory disjunction when I am listening to certain songs and talking to say...Mrs. Echols, one of the chaperones.  It will be freaky, at best. Anywho, I've still got laundry to do and decisions to make about whether to go for the huuuuge suitcase or the smallish one. S'posed to snow tomorrow in NYC, y'know.  I'm just sad that I haven't had more time to record the craziness of my life recently and partake in the looniness of others. I'm so pleased to finally be taking this trip as it has been lots of work to organize, etc. However, I'm all ready, so let the train leave the station, er, or the airplane leave the hanger as the case may be.  Wish us bon voyage and hope that nothing bad happens should we have a problem sneaking Alex Gutierrez through security.

Hasta la vista.  Will return next Monday with a full report. Hope life is good for you all...enjoy all your collective spring breaks, will ya now?  Go on, turn the computer off and live a little."

"event","Welp, I have been busy. I finished posting my pictures of all my knitted goods for sale to picturetrail and then emailed the whole faculty with the website address so they could know and then maybe buy something. I'm so pleased with myself I can't even stand it.  I hate when I am like this because I know that I am just waiting for people to tell me how great I am. It is so shameless. I think that everyone must know it, too, that I am waiting for them to reply with gushing praise.  They are sitting there, judging, thinking ""This girl really wants me to tell her how great she is, but I'm not going to give her the satisfaction. Hmph.""  Just like that.  ""Hmph.""    Except I just did it for them in my brain.  I took away the need for them to respond with praise.  I imagine that the world worships me for my talents, that they love everything I do, that they eventually recognize me with an honorary queenship.  When that day comes, I will pardon all the stubborn people for their misdeeds. For they know not what they do.

see for yourself how great I am.

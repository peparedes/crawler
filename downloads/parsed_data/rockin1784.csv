"event","I hope everyone had a fabulous new year's eve.

My night... well, Tyler and I went to Brett's house to hang out for the night and have some drinks. Patrick made us these drinks they named ""bubblegum bombers"". They were so strong, and I didn't realize it until I already had 2 of them. Tyler, Patrick and I went over to a friend's house. A friend from highschool was up for a visit, so we got to see him as well. He then decided to come back with us, and we had more to drink. Then everyone left, and it was just tyler, brett, heidi, and i. So we figured we would just ring in the new year at scott's. So we walked back over there, and we did the new year thing... kissing and such. I don't really remember much after that. I remember saying goodbye to shawn, then I remember hovering over a toilet with tyler telling me to throw up, then i remember hitting my head (but at the time i thought it was a dream), and then I woke up the next morning over a garbage can. It was a fun night. Apparently I fell on the walk home and my knee and hand are all scrapped up and i have a huge bruise on the side of my leg. Then when i was over the toilet, i couldnt hold myself up, so tyler was having to hold me up. I guess he lost his grip and i flew back into the wall where i smashed my head, and that really hurts. all in all, it was fun... but painful. 

happy 2006"

"event","I have come to realization that the people I associate with are AMAZING. I feel like I have ended up with exactly what I wanted. Everyone is so great in their own way, so positive.. I just adore them all. After a conversation with some old friends of mine I saw the other night, I realized that I have changed so much since sophomore year in high school. The drama has faded so much, and I just live life now, instead of always dreading it. Don't get me wrong, sometimes I can't stand it... but in the end I realize it's perfect (minus some slight flaws). I have made so many new friends also, and I just love it. I wish I could be closer to people, is seems all my friends live an hour away now, or I have to book appointments to see them. However, I guess that's part of growing up. Especially now, when everyone is trying so hard to create their lives, it's hard to squeeze me in. I understand. It's still too bad, I wish I could see them more. 

I can't wait to get out of this hell of a town. I like the small town feeling, but it's so boring and always the same stuff happens. I like that when someone from HS gets pregnant, we all know a week later, but there's the drama I was talking about. I'm tired of it. I want to move to a city, a busy place. Seattle would be fun, but I don't know if I would last 4 minutes down there. I actually don't mind where it is, as long as I get out. I need to get out of my mother's house, I need to be on my own. 

On a completely different note, I hit a possum. I was driving home on one of the back roads, and I didn't really see it until 2 seconds before it was under my tire. I screamed so loud, and for so long. I started shaking and crying and called my friend. People, I never wanna experience that again. It was so sad. Then my mom and Tyler decided to make me feel worse by telling me it was a mother, and that it had a broken leg and couldn't get to the other side fast enough.

K, thanks.

Ps. I NEED A NICKNAME. There are way too many Lindsay's around me and I am so tired of it. Someone please, come up with one."

"event","Guess what, I'M BACK. I was looking through my favorites list and came across LiveJournal and was like ""holy heck, I need to start that again"". So here I am. YAY. Currently I am trying to get a new job. I might be getting a receptionist job at a limo place.. which would be fun. They are gonna call me. I got a raise at work, but I really need more money than that... and they won't move me up to server, so I am a little ticked off. I decided that it's my Karma that is kicking me in the ass with everything lately. So, I am not gonna swear anymore, or atleast cut down on the swearing. Hopefully it will work.

I went to a concert the other day. I saw the rocket summer. It was so much fun. I almost didn't go, but then I decided that they won't be back for a while, so I might as well go. I am so happy I did. I got a pic with him, which was awesome.

I bought new shoes. My week sorta sucked, like.. ALOT. So I decided the best cure was a new pair of Vans. They are adorable. I love them.

Well, I'm off to work now. Hopefully everyone is doing good, and I can keep this up.

Thanks :D

"event","I am back housesitting again. This time for a week!! It's a little strange sleeping in a foreign bed, but it's huge, so I always seem to adjust. 

Today is Mother's Day. I felt so bad. I forgot to get my mom something so I went to target earlier and picked something up. I ran into an old friend while I was there, which was a great surprise!! Then I got us Cold Stone and came home. That's where I am now. I'm gonna hang around till about dinner time, then head back to seattle.

So that's my plan, yep... exciting!! I know!"

<P>I housesit for my uncle's often. They have 2 dogs.. who are the best dogs in the world. I love going over there. I just finished housesitting until Sat. I get to sleep in their HUGE bed, play with their dogs, swim in their hottub, and watch their bigscreen! I just love it... and them. I would do this for them forever if I could. It's in Seattle, which is a little nerveracking... but its fun. I just recently discovered a Dick's Drive In about 2 minutes from their house. I got so excited. </P>

"event","So today is May 2, 2005... which means as of midnight, I am 19 years old. It's now time for a Canada visit!!!

Well, let's talk about me most awesome weekend! It all started on Sat. morning! I went to Gene Juarez School of Beauty for a tour of the school. We pretty much decided that it is a definate. I can't wait to go, it seems like so much fun! Then, I came home and waited around a couple hours for Tyler to show up. He finally got here and we headed down to Everett to catch a bite to eat. We went to the outback, which was a little run down... because it's everett! Well, we finished around 4:30 and had nothing to do until 6:30... so we went bowling! We played to games, he won once and I won once, and we headed off to the CONCERT! That's right, we saw MAROON 5 live. We have seen them before, but last time our seating was as awesome. So we get there, find parking (which is a story in itself) and walk to the front doors. We stand around with the huge crowd for about 15 minutes, then they open the doors. We find our seats.. on the floor, row 36 biotch... and sit down. Now we had to wait another hour for the show to start. So we talked, and people watched, and called people. This smelly lady sat next to Tyler and this AWESOME mom lady sat next to me. I felt bad for Tyler. Then the show started! They had two opening acts... Simon Dawes and The Thrills... they were pretty good. Then Maroon 5 came on. OMG, I LOVE THEM. Let me set this up for you, we had seats 3 and 4, which means 3 seats in from the walkway that was around the seats. So, towards the end, I noticed the guitar player jump off stage, next thing I know, he was in the audience, 5 FEET FROM US... and if I was in seat in... 3 seats over.. I would have touched him. I could see the sweat on his head. I was so EXCITED!! Then it ended, sadly, and we left... and yes, got lost!!! But not as bad as usual cause we just followed traffic. Then got home, hung out till 1, then Tyler went home.

Sunday.... Tyler came over around 2:30 with my b-day present. It was a pot of really georgeous purple daisies and 4 gift cards. Old navy, starbucks, jamba juice, and quiznos. I was so happy. Then we decided to play five crowns... which BTW, is the best game in the world. But we ended up playing cheater about 50 times... but not really, about 6. I was supposed to be in Issaquah at 5.. which is 45 minutes from my house. And at 4:30 we were still playing cards. I finally stoped playing and Tyler left... sadly, and I jumped in my car and took off. I got to Issy, and we decided to go to danielle's grandmothers house so she could tan. Thank was fun. Then we came home and ate dinner. Then... her mom has a convertable, so she got the keys and headed up for some ice cream. It was so much fun driving at night in the convertable. So nice. I finally left at 11:30, and got home. Talked to james for a while then went to bed. And now I am here.

Bored now!??! Good!!!

"event","This is my very first LIVEJOURNAL entry. 

Do you even have ANY idea how long it took me to figure out how to get to this point?? I must say this site is rather complicated, but I think I am catching on. I got my picture up, and here I am typing to you (whoever YOU are)! 

I guess we can make this first entry an introduction to me. My name is Lindsay, I am 19, and live in WA. Some of my like would include my dodge neon, my cell phone, music, movies, radio, my friends, my family, my bed, a lot of my shoes, getting into intruiging conversations about the most pointless topics, gossiping about very nonimportant issues just because I can, starbucks coffee, shoping, money, pretty much my life in general. Some of my dislikes would include, my job, people who talk over me, airheads, someone WAY to into themselves, gossiping about things that will effect people or situations, strange odors, my cell phone (cause it has water damage), other people who CAN NOT drive, waking up early, and not being able to get to sleep.

Lets talk about Red Robin. Do not work there, if you can help it. Well, atleast don't work at the Woodinville one. The managers are crazy. We just got a new one though, so hopefully he will be cool. I have 4 managers and a kitchen manager. ALL MEN. The kitchen manager is AWESOME, but he controls only the kitchen, not where I work, which is really too bad. My GM is a huge jerk, and I am ready to not work for him anymore.

So... my birthday is on monday may 2. 5 days!! I can't wait. Saturday is gonna be a blast. I have the maroon 5 concert that tyler and I are going to be attending. I saw them once before, but this will be so much better!! Plus ty is coming home, thats awesome in itself!!! TRUST ME!! 

Well, I am thinking you are OFFICIALLY bored, if not already clicked out of this, so I will end it now. Hopefully I can figure it all out and make it better.

Mucho Love-
Linds"

I know I need to break it off. Its not going to last. We just aren't a good fit. It's not like we don't have fun, and I do love him...but its just not right. I need to break up. I just don't know how! How do you break up with someone and still try to maintain a friendship without it going sour or getting steamy again? I really really reallly don't want to cut him out of my life. We have good times together. So how do you do it!!! GAWWWWD!!!"

First let me say that I am deeply saddened by the unexpected death of Steve Irwin. As many of you are aware, Irwin was an inspiration to me and part of the reason I even want to be a biologist in the first place. I was going to marry him after all (Merry and Ashley remember this I'm sure). I am astonished that so many people consider this to be some sort of revenge on the part of animals. While I understand that his methods were seen as ""invasive"" to some, to assume that there is some mass conspiracy among nature is kinda far fetched. He put himself into dangerous situations and he knew the risks each time. His death was nothing more than a freak accident, not a calculated attack. Conservation lost a great crusader and he will be dearly missed among most of his colleagues. I grieve for his wife and fellow conservationist, and for his children who were certainly too young to lose their father.

In happier news, I am FINALLY moving out! Melissa and I found a really cool apartment that's right next to the Chrysler Museum. It's fabulous. No really, it is! I love it! Now I just have to convince Melissa to let me paint the kitchen and living room. I know what your thinking ""oh god, not neon pink keight, please no with the neon paint!"" And to you I say boo hiss! No I kid, I would never paint a room neon pink, can you imagine? You'd have to wear old grannie sunglasses to even step into the room. But ya, I've picked out some very ""keight"" colors, but we'll see if they can also be Melissa colors. We are, hopefully, officially going to sign the lease by the end of the week and then the place will be ours this weekend so I will get to move in ASAP. w00t!!!

School is going well, I can't really tell yet if my classes are easy or moderate or what, but no major crisis yet. I'm actually sitting in the student center right now buying time before my calculus class. I really want to sleep but I've injected enough caffeine into my system (via a pumpkin spice latte, yum) to keep me going for at least another hour. I am taking Ecology, Calculus, Computer Science (for bio majors), and Geology. I know its kinda slack, but I didn't want to start ODU and then have a major depressive crash or anything. Plus I really want to get a part time job (cause I totally quit the Aquarium gig thank the goddess) cause I am poor. 

I'm trying to think if there is anything else going on but my brain is like zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. So there ya go. I love you all, well most of you anyway. Later potaters!!!!!!"

"event","Blah, so i'm sitting here at the friggin aquairum and I am about ready to start taking hostages. I will be so happy when fall semester finally begins and I can bid adieu to this shit hole excuse for a job. I will of course be getting another job, but I am looking for somehting either a) closer to home so I don't spend half my meager pay check on gas, or b) pays more so I can afford to drive out this far. I would of course love both of those together. Anyway, moving on.

So ya, I FINALLY got confirmation from ODU about my acceptance. I was starting to sweat it a little there. So the next step is to make an appointment with my advisor and get my schedule set up. My summer classes are dragging on slowly. I have come to really despise my religion class. Yesterday they were trying to convince me that Jesus was somehow the first feminist and if it weren't for him then women would not have all the ""equalities"" we have now. Pained but still just wanting to get through the damned class without causing trouble for myself, I neglected to point out to them the 2,000 some years that followed Jesus and how much that still sucked, BIG TIME, in terms of sexual suppresion. I might have pointed out that it was only within the last few generations that we were even allowed to vote let alone freely hold jobs equivalent with men. I could have also pointed out that women still face a drastic pay difference than men within the same job. But I didn't. Cause I just want my A. 

So ya. anyway other than that here are some updates:

Audrey: totally perfect

Jay: Fuzzy

Andrew: Wunderbar!!!!

Family: nondysfunctional at this time"

"event","So its been freakin forever since I updated this thing and I thought I should since stuff has actually happened. Well my graduation request went through for TCC so, upon completion of my 3 summer classes, I will offically have my Associates degree. Horray! Now we are finally getting somewhere with this who academic thing. So when ODU finally makes their transfer decisions (which is really geting kinda late) then I will be attending a ""real"" school come fall. YAY!!!! And someday I will have a real degree and perhaps a job related to my field of choice. w00t! 

My Dad's retirment finally became offical on the 1st of July. We were sweating it for a little while waiting for job offers, but he now has a job working for a company which I forget the name of but you would recognize if I told you. He will be working with the Navy/military to develop antiterrorism tactics. Thats the general desciption anyway. He went into detail about it with me the other day, but I seem to be having a hard time retaining the knowledge. Anyway, the important thing is that he has a job and he is happy with that, so we aren't going to have to eat jay or throw him out or anything. We had a big backyard retirment shindig for him the last weekend in June in leiu of a ceremony. It was super fun, and I saw people that I haven't seen in YEARS!!! As a contibution to the party, my sissy and bro and I went through ALL the family photos we own to pick out about 70 some phtots of my dad throughout his life. It was really fascinating. I found this picture I LOVE of him when he was in his 20's. He's in northern California at Yellowstone standing by his little red mustang, surrounded by redwoods. Its a perfect picture. Very nostalgic. So after we picked out the pictures we took this platic stick things like they have in flower boquets for cards and we stuck them in all the flower arrangments. It was a big hit.

Pavel is coming to visit this weekend! Horray!! It should be super happy fun time. He;s actually coming to visit jay...EVERBODY comes over to see jay....nobody loves me...*sniffles*. So far our plans consist of eating...lots of eating. We have so many resturants to go to and so little money to do it with. I'm going to try to take him down to the outerbanks for an afternoon/evening since he never made it down there while he lived here. But ya, other than that we're just going to get fat and gossip about our lives. Fun shizznit!

Lets see, what else. I am still working at the aquarium. I have kinda come to the conclusiont hat I won't keep this particular job into the next semester. I will wait until I find a new one because I definetly like having money again, but ya. Its just that I am getting paid less than $6 an hour and its just not worht it. This coming semester is going to be the toughest yet and i don't want to spend my extra time at a job that dosen't compensate me for using my study time. That and it costs me too much to drive all the ay out to the beach. At least a third or more of my paychck has gone to gas, and I just don't make that much. So ya. Hopefully I can find a job that will fit into my schedule.

So the big news that most people want to know about. I am dating someone right now. He's a guy (I know right). He's in the navy (I KNOW right?). And we met at a lesbian bar (I KNOW RIGHT?!). His name is Andrew and he is a friend of Melissa and Denise. We met one night at the Hershee bar, and a few days later I added him on myspace and then he messaged me with his number, to which of course I messgaed him back with my number because I am totally phone shy. He called and we went to see Superman together. I actually was unaware that we were on a date at first until he handed me a box of godiva choclate covered strawberries. Then I was like ""oh......OOOOH!"". And we kinda just hit it off from there. Our big connection had been an interest in sci-fi. He has introduced me to the sci-fi channel's Battlestar Galatica, which I had previously written off but now I love. I wouldn't say we are serious yet, we've only been together for a week for goodness sakes, but things are thus far great. He rox my sox!!

So thats all the news thats fit to print, or at least I care to print anyway. I am too tired to spell check so deal with it. Sweet dreams and super fuzzy kittiness!"

I am getting paid peanuts, less than $6 an hour, but its a foot in the door and a chance to hang out with some cool people. Plus I really like having my own money. And how many people can say ""their are sharkies at my work!"" (Yes ashley I know, you have at your job oysters and you actually get to play with them and yes I am jealous but let me have this one thing)Hopefully my volunteer application will go through and I will get to play with the sharks some, or the otters, or maybe the turtles, or the seals?!?!?!?!

I finally got some ashley time on thursday and we went to Chocollage for lunch. I, miraculously, did not get one of the desserts but I did later scarff down about ten oreos to make up for it. Anyway, we went out to Cogans on friday and the bartender (female fyi) and both waitress's were super cute. I was convinced that our waitress totally wanted me, but I am pretty much convinced that anyone I think is cute wants me. Keight land is a wonderful place. I had two drinks of whatever she made me (I asked for anything with tequila in it) and we hung around for a plate of fries and then left. I did not wake up with any queasy effects of my own drinking, however I was forced to get up early because my sister was making some rather unsettling noises into the toilet. She had been out all night and did not express self control. I'd like to say she'd learned her lesson but......

So my computer is still broken. It won't turn on and thats uncool. My brother thinks I fried it but he hasn't been able to look at it actually let me know if I fried it. If that is the case I will either slit my wrists or have to slit someone elses. You see, my parents just spent $2300 (which I have to pay back) to fix my transmission. I am not really loving modern gadgets right now. Plus I have loads of work on that computer like papers, poetry, pictures, etc. Sigh. 

Ashley is teaching me how to knit! Its actually more exciting that it sounds. Its very relaxing and kinda puts you into a trance. I think I will knit a sweater and some booties for Jay, maybe a tail sock too. Hey its either this or I develop a drug habit, so deal with it (hows that for ""logic?"")

Life is moving on and I am managing. School is....going. This mike thing is....well imagine some eerie foggy morning on a boat where there is no wind, no movement, you are completly dead on the water. That would pretty much describe how I feel about it. I am very slowly and reluctantly beginning to accept, but do not understand why, he will probably never actually speak to me again. I am somewhat shell shocked from a bomb that I never actually saw or felt hit me. I am in limbo. It dosen't occupy all my thoughts, but I am human enough that it occupies some of them. i keep going over it but Istill don't know how it got to be the way it is now. I think that more than anything is what bothers me the most. I really can't trace the steps. i know a lot of you think that I shouldn't even bother with him and I respect that and mst of the time I wonder why I should even care if Iam going to be treated like a leper. I don't have an answer to it.

Anyway. So ya. Well this semester is kinda sort turning to poo academically. While I can drawn the line between it and other aspects of my charmed life, the truth is that I just haven't been feeling very motivated. I think its too soon in my other mess to say that I need to up the medication or start going to a psychologist, but I have considered both options. I know that everything I am feeling is normal and expected, but I am not sure if the way I cope with these things is. I have a tendency to dwell and torture myself over things I cannot help or change or control and when I do this I become preoccupied with my problems and my priorities become a bit distorted. They should really sell relationship insurance. Anyway, long story short is that I am not doing as well in my classes as I should be and I may be in danger of not passing one of them. May be. There is till time for a miracle. However, I have discovered that I can still get my associates at the end of summer if I switch my degree plan and then pile on some social science and humanities electives during summer. This way I still have my automatic entrance into ODU. But like I said, I may be able to fix things and finish the plan I have been on. We'll see. 

In much more happy news, Melissa and I are working on finding an apartment together! w00t!!! We're planning on apartment hunting this weekend and I have my fingers crossed that we'll find an affordable luxury apartment with full amenities in Ghent......a girl can dream. I mostly want something that allows kitties and is close to ODU. Melissa wants something with parking and where she won't get shot. I think between us we can find something. The game is afoot!!!

Um what else......Cassi kidnapped my Ashley and stole her away to england!!!!!! Or Ireland? Where are you now? I can't keep track of you. Regardless, give her back!!!! She's mine I tell you! MINE!!!!

I hate that its 1:25 am and I can't call anyone to help me not feel like this. I hate that I keep listening to sad songs. I hate that I am crying...again. I hate thinking that I am overreacting. I hate that I can't just get over it. I hate that I don't believe myself when I say that things really will get better. I hate the lack of communication. I hate that I can't write an email because it makes me feel clingly and needy and stupid, really stupid."

So anyway, we've been working out the financial situation to see if I can actually go to SDSU, I will let you all know the final decision when it comes. I'm still waiting to hear from SJSU and UCSB, but I don't expect to hear from either until mid march. 

I'm still single. gag. Most of the time I'm cool with it, and then other times I'm so lonely I might as well try the goth thing again. I know this is the right path, but it doesen't make it any easier for this half of the pair. I think bitter breakups are sooo much easier. Some angry songs, a girls night out, and a hair cut and your over it cause you are ""better off with out 'im."" Poop. I totally sound like a pity party and I'm really not. I've only cried once since it happened (last week after micro lab and right before lecture). So I'm not all like woe is me or anything. But ya, sometimes I regret it even knwoing it was the right thing to do. LOVE STINKS!!!! 

Anways, this update sucks cause I totally sound like I'm depressed and I am totally not. I AM however on my period which could account for the ""life's a bitch"" thing I have going on. I think I will take a longer study break and go outside with the kittyness or something. Laters!!!"

"event","So I turned 22. Kinda feels like 21. MY sister paid for part of a dress from Nordstroms as a b-day present. My parents bought me dinner (well my dad did because mom is still helping her mom recover from surgery) at 456 Fish and I got to invite Ashley along cause my parents totally adore her. I wore my new dress which looked fabulous so for the night I felt invincible. After dinner Ashely, Boodles, and B's friend Chris and I went out to CPK for dessert and drinks. The dessert was good but I totally got giped on the drink. Ah well. All in all I had a good B-day. 

More importantly: It was Audrey's and my 2ND ANNIVERSARY!!!!!!! Yes, we have been together for 2 glorious fuzzy years. Audrey asked me to let you know that catnip and tuna would make acceptable gifts.

School is going fine. Micro is by far my fav class cause I get to wear a lab coat and pretend I am an expert on Streptobassilus and Staphylococcus. Yesterday I did my first Gram Stain with E. Coli which was neat cause its actually somewhat ""dangerous"" and isn't that really the whole reason to go into sciences? To live on the edge? As an aspiring shark biologist I say yes.

Chem sucks, but then chem usually does. Precalc is so far not bad. History is good because the prof talks like someone on the History ChanneL and I LOVE the history channel. Student Development is a waste of time but an easy A. 

So there ya go. tis all for now. A happy unbirthday to everyone and Happy unkittyanniversary to you all as well!"

"event","So here's an itty bitty update since i haven't made one in a while. I'm at Mike's right now, I drove down on the 28 and I'm leaving tomorrow :-( We've just really been lounging about for the most part, though I must confess today I did insist that we drive 30 min to Barnes and Noble because I desperatly needed something that didn't have a small town country feel. I am a snobby ho. Of this I am aware. I got to meet Mike's boss and his wife yesterday. We went to lunch at Kobe, which was scumptious, and then later we went over to his friend...um....insert name that started with a Z I think...house who was having a New Year's Eve party with some other of Mike's friends. We didn't stay for too long beecause, again, I am a snobby selfish whore and even with happy pills I still don't do the whole party scene very well. However I was severly punished because there was a New Year's Naruto marathoin on Cartoon Network. I was forced to watch four hours of a spaztic ninja. BELIVE IT!!! (if you've seen it you'll get that last part). But I survived and Mike was happy so it all worked out in the end. So 2006 rolled around, as the new year does, about midnight and we kissed and I called my mom (really because I wanted to check on my kitty whom I miss very very very much). If Ashley is reading this I would have called you but I wasn't sure if you'd be up because I know you're not a late night person and I didn't want to be rude and wake up your household.

"event","I can't believe October is almost over!!!! I haven't even gotten a pumpkin yet!!!!!!! That the problem with daylight hours becoming shorter, the day seems to skirt away with them. I really cannot quite figure out what it is I have done all month that it has passed so quickly, but here we are.

I don't really have any news to report. The semester is moving along pretty slow but classes are going well. My mom and I have discussed what would become of me for Spring semester (whether I would transfer to ODU or not) and I decided that the best course of action would be to finish the year at TCC. This way I will finish all the general credits required for ODU and I can finish up some of the sequences I already have in progress. Also, I should have my associates by the end of summer which automatically grants me admittance to ODU. 

There is, however, another option. I am allowed to apply to California schools witht the understanding that if I do get in, I can only go if I get financial aid/student loan/scholarship/whatever to bring down the out of state cost. This is totally sweet. So I am appling to SDSU (duh), UC Santa Barbara, and San Jose State. Right now I am not getting my hopes too high, I am more curious if I even can get in (especially because SDSU makes themselves sound like a bitch to tranfer into as an out of state student). I'd apply to UCSD except that they do not, suprisingly, have a Marine Biology program. If anyone wishes to challenge me on that, I welcome it. I had to look a few time before I accepted that they lacked my major....then I burst into tears.....sniffles... So ya. Right now all I am waiting on is for TCC's priority registration to start so I can get my spring classes on my transcript before I send it off. Please keep your fingures crossed, say your prayers, light a candle, whatever you do. I really want this. And I KNOW there are a few of you who would be happy to be rid of me and the west coast is as far as I am practically gonna get at the moment. I also know that there are at least two people (Ashley and Cassi) who don't want me so far away, but remember girls: you totally have a free place to stay when you come visit cause you totally will have to. 

So far my planned list of classes for next semester is as follows

College Chemistry I
Oceanography II
Precalculus I
Western Civ II
Student Development (blah)

And then next Summer will be:

College Chem II
Precalculus II
Coastal Ecology 

I hope that sounds impressive enough for them to be like ""Hey, we don't even need to look at anything else, lets invite her, and pay for her, and rent her an apartment too!!""

Anyway, I am off for now. Superfuzzykittiness!!!!!"

He stopped by for a few hours before heading down to sumter. BEST FEW HOURS EVER!!!! I can't possibly describe how charged I am right now! My baby is home!!!!! All is well with the world....okay...in Keight's specific sphere of existence all is well. One more week till super fun cabin time!

In other Keight news, my dad was deployed last week on the Comfort down to the Hurricane disaster area. We don't know when he will be back, but we are pretty sure it won't be before mid October. There is a lot of disorganization down there. People aren't sure where to get help or how to use the help offered. Dad says its going to be at least a few months before any real order is restored. 

School is going well. No fun classes this semester, but whatcha gonna do? Now that Mike is home I am totally stoked about life so even mundane things seem ineteresting. Of course now Audrey (who is sitting next to the keyboard as I type) is giving me a very indignant look that says ""I thought I made life exciting?"" Its either that or ""Change my litter box."" I'm not sure which.

Perry up until he died when I was 5, then Max. We went through a few hamsters: Honey, Patrick, and Buttons. We also had a bunny named Posey which my mom got for xmas before the summer we got my horse, Cody. So ya, I've had a few pets.

10. Who was your celebrity crush?
Clarissa from Clarissa explains it all and I had the biggest thing for Linda Hamilton in T2. I also had the JTT crush.

~*~The Present~*~
1. What do you want to do with your life?
Swim with sharks, be a better pagan, marry Mike, ride horses again, work for animal welfare...stuff...

2. Who are your top five favorite bands/musical artists?
I hate this kind of question. At the moment I am listening to Kathleen Edwards and Shannon Mcnally. 

3. What do you look like? (Pictures appreciated)
short, blond, blue eyes, two uneven boobs, but I think I look pretty good

4. Who's your best friend?
Merry, Ashley, Cassi, (yes you too Pavel) and MIKE!!!!

5. Where do you live?
Home with my parents.

6. What's your favorite thing to do?
pick my nose? Oh. Spend time with my gato, pine over Mike, sex with Mike, quality time with Mike, walk Jay, hang out with friends, etc etc

7. Are you in a relationship?
MIKE!!!

8. What kind of student are you?
A decent student. I'm smart, but not an overachiever. I try not to trigger my stress too much, cause we all know where that gets keight

9. Pets?
AUDREY!!! Jay and Rainy are there too, as well as Lexi the tri pawed kitty

10. Who is on your top five list of famous people you can sleep with without your significant other getting jealous? (a la Friends)
Carrie Anne Moss and prolly any other female he can watch, tape, or join me with

1. How do you see yourself in ten years?
I see two completely different views. One is very Jane Goodall with sharks and the other is very Sandra Bullock a la Practical Magic. Either way Mike should be there.

2. What bands do you think you'll be embarrassed to admit you liked in ten years?
I think I'm past that age where I get embarrased by that. I listen to a lot of stuff, country included.

Hopefully still totally hot

4. Do you think you'll still be in touch with your current best friend?
haven't fallen out of touch yet, so I'm sure

well I assume I'm going to live a while, so I'd like to live more than one place. CA again of course, the Northeast, and overseas again.

6. Do you think you'll have time for hobbies?
Well my proposed career is my hobby

7. Describe your pefect wedding.

Ready for this? Okay, pretty much the only thing that has changed in this from when I started planning at 10 is I'm pagan now and I've been torn over whether I'm gay or not for most of my life. so given that I'll be marrying Mike and still Pagan, this is my wedding: It has to be in October because thats my favorite month (you know with Samhain and pumpkins and everything) I'd really like to do it in New England for the color, but a recent talk with my mom (she told me she was so NOT paying for a bunch of people to go to New England for me to get married) has led me to consider Shenendoah. As long as we have the color I think I'll survive. anyway, it has to be outside (pagan, remember?) cause thats the whole point of doing a fall wedding IMHO. Anyway, I want traditional celtic music to play during the ceremony, preferably bagpipes. I will be in a very simple white dress (prolly this or something like it http://davidsbridal.com/bridal_gowns_detail.jsp?stid=1899&prodgroup=123) with a wreath or circlet instead of a veil. I'd like to wear a sash of the Macquarrie tartan (one of my clans). Merry will be the Maid of Honor of course and Ashley and Boodles are going to be the bridesmaids. I'm not sure if I want a Priestess to lead our vows or a justice of the peace, thats one we still have to discuss. I know it makes no differebce to the divine, its really a matter of our hearts. I think Cerridwen will honor our union regardless of who joins us. Besides, we can always perform a seperate ritual just the two of us asking for her blessing. I want my reception outside as well. It'll be under cream colored tents. I want everything lit by candles and I want celtic music mixed with some more ""modern"" stuff. I want to have my cake ordered from Extraordinary Desserts in san diego. The tables will be decorated with pumpkin center pieces with maple leaf carvings in them. thats really all I can think of for now.

8. Do you think you'll use what you're learning in school?
depends

9. What kind of pets do you want?
puppies and kitties and pnies and fishies and all sorts of stuff!

10. What famous people do you think will still be around in ten years?
who ever deserves it or sucks up to the spotlight or causes a scandal enough"

"event","So I guess I should update this thing since everyone *coughPavelcough* has been on my case to do so. So classes have been going really well, especially Bio. I spend a lot of extra time in the lab going over slides and just generally enjoying myself. I find open lab time to be somewhat relaxing...weird yes? For example, today I had a philosophy test which I was really stressing (and prolly did really well on, but I'll believe it when i see it) and afterward I went to lab just to unwind. Its nice and quiet, usually I am the only one there. i like going over the slides and looking at all the weirdo stuff we have in jars. I got to dissect two extra star fish to help my lab teacher find a really good one for our midterm last week. I dunno, its just fun.

Anyway, so ya. Pavel comes to visit in a few days! We're gonna go to IHOP for the whole funnel cake thing going on and then its all up in the air (sorry Pavelkins, thats the only idea I have.) We'll prolly go to the Chrysler and Marine Science Museum, plus the beach, Fairgrounds...where else? Its sure to be an adventure! Well actually, he'll prolly just end up spending time with Audrey and Jay since thats who he's really coming to see....thats who everyone always comes to see....sigh....

This is the most boring entry ever I swear. Not to mention all the grammatical and spelling errors. Ugh!

I got to see Iron and Wine last monday! I went with my new bestest pal, Justin! (applause) We had a really good time and I got to know him a lot better...well actually he got to know ME a lot better cause I could not shut up. I had had a mocha with 4 shots before I went so I was super talkative. (side note: does anyone else notice I sound like one of those girls from ""Mean Girls"" or something??? have I lost all integrity????!!!!???). Though according to Mike I am ALWAYS that talkative. Maybe I drink espresso so much that its in my blood now? *shrugs* anyhoo, so ya, Justin rocks!!

I also got to see Cassi twice in the last week! We went to see Madagascar, which was AWSOME, and Bewitched, which was so so. It had its moments, but I was kinda unimpressed. But I had a lot of fun hanging out with her again, we had long sex talks in public, which is always fun. I love getting weird looks from people when you say ""penis"" or ""orgasm"" in your normal shamelss voice. Fun stuff.

*sad dreamy sigh* I just hung up with Mike. 74 more days till his tentative return date. I have a count down on my dry-erase board. I am so whipped. I've given up writing all the deep intmate things I have to say about and to Mike on this thing, it just dosen't feel the same. I feel no shame in declaring how I feel about Mike, that I love him, to everyone, but somehow it would be wrong to let the special little things hang out in the open to be seen and scrutinized. I love Mike. That is all I need to say, and all the network of people who read this need to know. Mike is the partner people undergo spiritual quests and little love spells to find. He is nothing short of sublime and I cherish every moment I have with him, whether at his side or nestling in the cradle of his voice. I love Mike.




p.s. send love to Misa. i love you babe."

<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>True Neutral</b> characters are very rare. They believe that balance is the most important thing, and will not side with any other force. They will do whatever is necessary to preserve that balance, even if it means switching allegiances suddenly.
<br><br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Elves</b> are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.
<br><br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Rangers</b> are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.
<br><br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Bards</b> are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.
<br><br><u>Deity:</u><br><b>Silvanus</b> is the True Neutral god of nature. He is also known as the Patron of Druids. His followers believe in the perfect balance of nature, and believe that nature's bounty is preferable to any other 'civilizing' method. They wear leather or metallic scale mail, constructed of leaf-shaped scales. Silvanus's symbol is an oak leaf.

But since I don't know anything about her, I guess you all will have to settle for adventures in Keight land. Here we go.

So my final day of work was May 20th. It was the best day of work I had had thus far. One of my bosses took me out to lunch with my mom and his secretary. He, of course, had to give me a hard time one last time before sending me off into the acedemic world. My classes started that Monday, May 23rd. I have Bio 102 lecture, Into to Pysch (with my Human Sexuality teacher), and Philosophy 101 on Mondays and Wednsdays, and English 112 and Bio 102 lab on tuesdays and thursdays. So far I enjoy my classes, especially bio. We have dissected an earthworm, crayfish, starfish, and frog. The starfish was my favorite. For a creature with no brain, it can perform fascinatingly complex tasks. I had my first bio test last week. I am pretty sure I did well, but I won't know until next week. I also had my Eng and Phi tests. I got an A in english and I am CERTAIN I rocked my Phi test! w00t!! so ya, classes have been going well and I am hoping for A's in all of them, which is totally possible, but would happily settle for a B.

Thats really been the whole of my life so far. Its been really cloudy and somewhat rainy here, so I haven't had many chances to go lay on the beach. I am DETERMINED to go diving this summer. I haven't been under in forever and I miss it, especially with taking this bio class and talking about Cephalopods and Crustaceans and Cnidarians (I'm totally smart cause I can use big words now). So ya, Anyone who wants to go with I would be happy to drag along with me. If you need to get certified I would be more than willing to be your dive buddy since I probably need a refresher course anyway. Plus I have to redo the Advanced course since apparently the paperwork either a) never got sent, or b) got lost along the way somewhere. so ya, diving anyone?"

My AP Composition book is strange. I don't think I've ever read anything that references The Winter of our Discount Tent AND Tequila Mockingbird. It's made for college students, so all is good. I got stuff from GMU's Engineering and Computer Science department! Probably because I asked the counselor-woman for upcoming Civil Engineering/Computer Science things going on. It was just surprising that it came from GMU, since they're on top of my Virginia-list. =). I'll probably go for the little presentation. Cooligkeit!"

"event","Just got finished watching TAR. I've been watching it pretty much every night. It's really cool. Tonight they ended in Agra/New Delhi, India. Now, I've seen the show go to India in many other seasons, but none were like this. They portrayed India the right way. They showed a scarier side of the place. The teams were not ready for these people who didn't speak their language and the kids. OH. The kids. The kids would just drag themselves onto the contestants asking for money. And there's this shot of a tiny kid, couldn't've been older than 6 holding a baby walking down a highway to the travelers. And the teams were frantic, and I don't blame them. It's hard enough for them to do that stuff on very little sleep and extreme jet lag, but to do it in extremely populated India, yeah. It's hard. It was just a huge difference from when TAR7 went to India and the people loved all the teams and were helpful and really really nice. It was strange. Maybe it was that they were in a different place.

I should get kicking on these damn AP projects and GET TICKETS TO FUCKING CALIFORNIA."

English definitely comes first though. Uh. I'm so excited to get there. It's going to be great seeing everyone :). My plane has a layover in Dallas and then we go on to beautiful sacramento to rent our SUV and drive to Grass Valley (it'll be around 12:30 AM when we get to Grass Valley). Apparently, I'm not traveling alone like last time. I'm probably going to think of these flights as so short ever since being on Germany (and I even thought those were pretty short).

I'm using my sister's computer right now without her knowing it, not that she'd really care. I even told Katie today, ""I haven't had many problems with my computer, I'm lucky."" Gr! Luckily, I haven't lost complete use of my computer or anything, just a few keys are gone now. All I need to do is reformat my computer (after I burn all of my files/music onto CDs) and start again! Now, that would be so much easier if I had my Windows XP disc somewhere. 

Nothing too major, but quite a hassle. My aunt Luanne is here with my other Aunt and Uncle. We ate huge California King Crab that was sooooo good. I'm going to be 400 pounds by Monday. Oh well, the food is great. Speaking of pounds, instead of running the regular one mile (No, I'm not still doing that from when in the summer, I just started a few days ago), tonight I shall run 1.5-2 miles. I'll try to push myself. It's only an extra ten minutes anyway.

Those teams are so amazingly lucky. No, scratch that. <lj user=""Penguin_attie""> is amazingly lucky. The teams couldn't speak a lick of German and it was so funny to hear them pronounce these words. They went to that church that was bombed (forgot the name!) that Attie showed me.Then they went to the Brandenburg Gate where the leg ended. I wonder what they'll be doing next in Berlin. Haha.

Please tell me that I'm not the only one who doesn't completely understand it. This might've been because I was stupified at that time, but I saw a group of guys (do I even have to say who they were?) hiking. On climbing the mountain, one (Till?) falls off the cliff, surprisingly he doesn't die. Uh. They take him back to what seems base camp to sleep (and have this awkward pause in the song) and I guess they just wake up the next morning and drag him up to the top with all three million other people. There's a cross at the top.. and and .. well I think I'm just missing something extremely important.

The FBI had an opening for an assassin. After all the background checks, interviews and testing were done there were 3 finalists. Two men and a woman. For the final test, the FBI agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. 

""We must know that you will follow your instructions no matter what the circumstances. Inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill Her!!!"" The man said, ""You can't be serious! I could never shoot my wife."" The agent said, ""Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife and go home."" 

The second man was given! the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes, ""I tried, but I can't kill my wife."" The agent said, ""You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home."" 

Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman, She wiped the sweat from her brow. ""This gun is loaded with blanks"" she said. ""I had to beat him to death with the chair."" 
MORAL: Women are evil. Don't mess with them.

As does my sister (we all know where she gets her opinions from). Why? Apparently Spanish will be taking over the USA in a couple years and I will rot in a burning mexicano hell while this happens. My father/sister seem to think the English language will be lost forever which would be a major let down to the rest of the world as well as us. I have nothing against the Spanish language, it's just not for me. Alot of people (especially from here where Spanish speakers are rare) forget their Spanish after high school. My sister shouldn't have any room to talk, her grades for spanish are good (I think), but she can't speak a word of the language. I know she can't understand native speakers or fast speakers either. For her, it's just an easy class where you listen to people talk. Even if I don't use German for alot of my life, at least I'll have the chance to know an interesting language that contributed to our own language (not saying spanish didn't, but I don't think it did as greatly, correct me if I'm wrong.). Plus, German is on the dark side... they have cookies."

Thanks Ms. Salo, I love being told to do an essay as well as read 3 chapters in a textbook while taking notes. BUT I did sign up for an AP class and I wasn't expecting it to be easy, so I'm not upset, but I am alittle crazy over getting my work done. I think I'm going to finish up the Driver's Ed and Alg. 2 on Wednsday, and do the Essay tomorrow. I think I'll finish the essay pretty fast since I'm on a computer and I'll get the Algebra 2 done. The plane ride home will be reserved for my APWH reading and note taking. Then when I get home I'll have to do the English and whatever small amount of biology she gave me. Monday I have PE. Eh. Yay? oh well. Europe was far more worth it than missing everything. And if I do suffocate from all the papers that will be pushed at me on Monday, I'll die in peace. Sonia knows what I'm going to get..."

"event","Woo. Ok, I'm feeling great now (probably because of the aspirin, but oh well). We went to the Schwetsingen (or Schwetsinger, Schwetsing, whatever they call it.. everyone says something different) Schloss today, but they were expensive and timely (plus the tours were in German.. so). I swear, if we stayed here for a month, we'd be fluent. Sorry to you guys in Virginia if I get back and am still answering with Ja or Nein and saying Entschuldigung and Danke, remind me which country I'm in. We ate at the Italian restaurant with more liquor. I had a pizza. Nice place. I don't know though, we should be going to France sometime (I know, Three countries in two weeks). God, but I can't get that video and song from Rammstein out of my head. Sonia, you should download the song, but the video is just interestingly enjoyable. People, I'll be on AIM for awhile.

"event","I feel incredibly sorry for all of those young teenagers today.  What a horrible time to be searching for yourself.  So much time spent perfecting makeup and hair and acessories.  When they're older they're really going to wish they hadn't wasted so much time on silly things.  It must be so hard to try to live up to one singular image.  They should try worshipping themselves the way they were before they discovered Paris Hilton.  Before they begged mom and daddy for little yapping dog and clothes worth more than some people's cars, just so they could be accepted by their ""friends"".  Man, i'm really glad i was born in the eighties.  aren't you?"

"event","my feet hurt so bad. stupid shoes. i don't think i'm cut out for crew. i'm more of a people person. brittany and i would make at least $10 each from concession tips, and now Ben and Lydia are doing it, they made $4 total. hhahaha. i fucked up today. i'll get that stupid mist thing right tomorrow. but i did the blood awesome! woowoo. ugh, lydia and ben left after intermission, so of course I had to do the ice chests at the end of the night. those kids need to get it straight. whitney is a control freak. but she's a good person. she just needs to let people do things themselves and wait for them to ask for help instead of just interjection her opinion all the time. i haven't spent a lot of time with liz lately. we've never seemed to be in the same place at the same time this summer. during merchant, she was in the show, and brittany and i were doing concessions. for othello, we're doing crew and liz is doing intern stuff. we don't have any scenes together in 2 gents, so i never see her anymore. she just called me. she probably thinks i'm mad at her or don't like her anymore. i just had a kind of left of the middle day today. not as bad as the other day though. 2 and a half weeks until 2 gents opens. i think we're in good shape. gary's awesome. i love that fool. he knows i know the secret. the first time i saw him today he stared and smiled at me as he passed by. special K told him i guessed it. he better be nice to me or i might let something slip. i really want to see west side. i can't though, because of crew. i'm playing lucetta in 2 gents, by the way. i asked gary if i could be eating cheez-itz out of my purse. he liked it. it makes sense, because my name's lu-CHEDDA. haha. this role was so type-cast. it's hilarious. anyone who sees it will know. the whole time, i'm laying on a bench eating. and all the lines are so easy because they're things i would actually say. brittany gave me one of the best compliments of my life yesterday. it was roughly as follows: 
BRITTANY: Molly, you'd be a good director, because you know how to take control, you know your shit, and you have genious ideas. 
coming from brittany, i consider that extremely flattering.
there's a woman in othello who is a horrible actor. and she takes herself so seriously offstage. it's hilarious. people who take themselves too seriously make me laugh so much. quagmire still has not said one word to any of the interns. what is UP with that guy? he takes himself a little too seriously as well, and he also sucks. really the only people who are good are tony, sean, gavin and gary. i wonder why there are so few female actors in sft. girlie-girl is really immature, and she dresses so badly. today everything she wore was different shades of blue. it matched waaaaaaaaay to well. 

ok i need to stop bitching about this stupid stuff. goodnight moon."

"event","today was a really bad day. i felt better when i talked to trisha though. but everything else was horrible. oh except when evan was making fun of liz when she was shit drunk last summer and was all over him. that shit was funny. 

but anyway, everything is wrong still. i thought talking about it last night would help, but it just made me feel worse. i think too much. i have that sick feeling in my stomach and that tight feeling in my chest that i get when i get crazy. whitney asked me what was wrong. she doesn't know me well enough to know that i hate that. if i need help, i'll ask for it. trust me. everything i eat tastes bad. it all makes me feel so sick. everything i see and hear makes me want to cry. daniel was telling me today about his daughter who is now 20 or 21 whom he has never met. i'm afraid i'll make mistakes like that. i'm afraid i'll fuck up my life and then before i know it, it will be gone and i won't have done anything. but seeing daniel and how happy he is, and how much he loves life after all the shit he's been through, makes me feel a lot better. the whole concept of the world and how people go through life so blind to everything except their own lives brings me to the point of tears. i can't deal with the fact that i may very well die alone. death scares me. no, regret scares me. i'm afraid of what i'll miss after i'm dead. i'm afraid of all the things i never said and did. and i'm afraid that if people i care about are gone tomorrow, they won't know how i feel. but i can't bring myself to say the things i want to say because i'm afraid of what will happen. but it's only people i care about. the people closest to me are the ones i keep the darkest secrets from. because they are the only ones who's opinions matter to me. 
and poor, poor lucy. we all care about her so much even though none of us really know her. she always brightened up any room she was in. she counteracted with the theatre people's drama. she is so sweet. i hope she gets better. please, please let lucy get better. 
why do things have to be so tragic? why do people have to die? why are some people not loved? how can people be so horrible, and shameful, and secretive, and bitter, and jealous? people are horrible, horrible things."

john lost the fuzy off my earphone. he didn't look for it. he leaves his dishes everywhere. i think my parents over-compensated for him being one of the middle children. he has to be the favorite. he does favors with a smug sigh like he's a fucking angel and even though he's done all the other housework, he'll take time out and do this because he's such a fucking good person. i'm the villain when he's home. he needs to take a goddamn bath. he's making the house smell like fucking shit. treehugger

"event","I'm back from Newellton. My grandpa has a week to live. I think I have a real problem with death. Every time it gets close to me, I run the other way and try to completely avoid it. Maybe I don't want any responsibility. I don't want the fact that I may or may not have done something or said something wrong in someone's last hours hanging over me for the rest of my life. And seeing him, laying there in bed, thin and frail and sallow was such a shock. Just a few months ago he was hilarious and full of life and stories and jokes. Now all he can do is lay in that bed, wasting away the last days of his life. He's on morphine and other things, so he's hallucinating. His eyes open in his sleep and he moves his hands like he's in his shop again, or working in the garden again. He always asks for his hands to be washed, and says they're not clean enough. He tries to put his thumbs in his pants like he used to do. He tries to chew on the toothpick that was always in his teeth. He drinks out of the tin cup that hung on the cooler in the back of his truck. He moves his hands like he's driving the tractor. His skin on his face and hands is suddenly so thin and yellow. He looks already dead. I wonder if he knows he's going to die soon. His conscious mind has died already I think. Nothing he says now is in relation to anything that is actually happening. He used to be so tall, but on that bed he looks so small. And his voice. His voice used to be deep and colorful and unmistakable, now it's wheezy and higher in pitch, like someone is strangling him. I think the thing that's making this so hard for me is the change. He's a completely different person. He used to tell me stories and talk about the war and things, now he doesn't recognize me. Soon he won't recognize his own daughter, or sons, or wife. This is the closest death has ever been to me. It doesn't make sense, and it makes me so angry. I don't know if I'll be able to handle the funeral. That sounds so selfish. Dad is losing his father, and maw-maw, her husband. I feel like I should only show a degree of sadness. I think most of the tears are just from fear. People fear things they don't understand, and this I do not understand. 
Adam's mother-in-law died saturday morning. He wasn't there with Rachel. He was crying, mom was crying. He went back to Boston that night. At least he's there for Rachel now. In my life, people always die in groups of 3. Wendy, my paw-paw, and a third. I'm waiting to see. I'm desperately hoping this time will break the routine."

"event","I just spent the last 20 minutes crying. That's a long time for me. I need to leave, and leave now. Maybe I'll stay away forever. So, this isn't why I was crying, but I thought about it and, Britt's right, as usual, Gerard Way is a self-centered bastard. I mean, he has to be! He's a fucking rockstar! Do I care? Yes, actually I do. I guess it's over now. The whole Gerard Way thing. Thanks a lot, Britt, aka bastardo...he's so dumb. No, I guess he's not. But his parents are! Even though his dad is a hot centaur...who walks around in his undies all the time to the delight of me and Liz. Shakespeare fest sign-up is starting! I'm so excited! The sooner I can start doing plays again and forget about everything, the better. I can't sleep, as usual."

"event","I think I got into Utah! I'm pretty sure. I was emailing the woman who auditioned me, you know, to keep myself in their minds so they wouldn't forget about my out of this world talents and all, and she said, ""Yeah, I would go ahead and apply. I'm sending you an acceptance letter."" Really though, if I get into Utah, I might cry. I might cry like I did in my audition. That was the best freaking audition I've had in my life!!! I'm in love with them!! But I reeeally don't want Cortez to go there. He said he got accepted...which is not promising for any of us because we all know, he is probably the worst actor on the face of the earth. But I don't care, I'm going to Utah, and no mormons or big black gay men are going to stop me!!!"

"event","Whew! Anton remembered to clean the house! That was a close one. Good thing he's responsible and all. So I had planned this toootally bitchin' weekend for me and liz and the gang, but I suddenly remembered I have to treck up to Newellton to visit my paw-paw. He has liver cancer. He has a few months to live. I realized I'm really horrible with goodbyes. Long-term goodbyes. I guess it's because I have a huge fear of regret. If I never get to see someone again, I'll be haunted with the feeling that I forgot to tell them something, or forgot to do something. It's the scariest thing I can think of. It sounds selfish, I shouldn't be thinking about how bad this is making me feel, I should be thinking about him. People in my life die in groups of 3...sometimes more...so I'm waiting to see who's next. 

I'm watching the news. It wasn't my idea, it's my mom. Is it just me, or does bad news come in floods? A highschool shooting in the midwest killed something like 11 people. A guy took his gradfather's police guns and killed his grandparents, then a teacher, a security guard, students, and himself. There was a shooting at a New Orleans school recently. The parents don't seem to care. A woman's house burned down. She was crying, she doesn't have anywhere to go. I feel really bad about Brianna. She could have died. What if she had died? What would we have done? I can't think about it. I'm going to bed. I can't go to bed. I'm going to do something else. I don't know what."

"event","So, I'm like dying right now. I have a stomach virus. I can't eat anything because my body will expel it as soon as or before it hits my stomach, I can't even drink water, which means I will have to live with being dehydrated for days. My back and stomach are in such pain from being bent over the toilet twice every hour that I can't laugh or cough or talk a whole lot. I can't lay down because the post nasal drip that's also going on makes me even more sick when it creeps into my throat and I have a horrible headache on top of everything else. But I feel better than I did yesterday, so that's good. And I really do appreciate certain people bringing me soup, but I wasn't about to get up and use up all my energy trying to open the door and end up hugging the tiolette again. I mean, I can't even eat soup anyway. But it was really nice of cerain people to do that. I hope anton remembered to clean the house, my dad will be there sometime today..."

"event","Yeah, well life is life. I lit someones hair on fire friday in school. SO this means I have 5 days OSS. I probably wont be able to go to prom. And may not be able to graduate either. Oh well. What can I do. Thats just my luck. Yeah so once again shit hit the fan with someone. And once again, I hadda clean it up. The fan is clean now, for now. but as I have learned in the past that can change in an instant. This weekend was better than any I've had in a long long long time. I got to chill with someone everyday this weekend. It was great. Today I went to her dance competition, I didnt get to see any of her routines, but I saw her get her medals and stuff. It was nice. I dunno. I'm jus not in one of the best moods, I guess its because no matter how hard I try, I can never get things good enough in her life to be acceptable, and make her happy. She lets her family and what not bring her down way too much. I cant wait till the day she finally realizes, that she really is beautiful and she really is a great person, and that I love her more than anyone on earth. One day she'll see. Thats my goal in life. To make sure she knows how great she really is, and that there is more to life than her problems and setbacks. blah. I dunno. I jus wanna sleep. I really do. I wanna go to bed with her and wake up again when we are like 25. And we'll have good jobs and start a family. I needa go. I love you Dork!"

I'll just have to deal... I duct taped the vents in the dash because I have a leak somewhere in the antifreeze line and when it gets on the engine block it evaporates then goes up thru the firewall and thru the vents and condenses on my windshield and because its not regular water when you go to wipe it it only makes it worse... so the duct tape worked... and I bought all new interior lights for my truck... my lights are all blue... I am soo excited... and last night was jus unbelievable... we went to the beach and chilled with my friend tittie... he fixed my e-brake and played some arcade games and had some christies pizza and went to wendy's at like 12:30... it was just plain old great...

We then went to get on the bus.... ummm.... the heater was off... wtf is going on.... our bus broke..... nothing worked other than it being drivable.... so we froze our asses off all the way back to the hotel... I couldnt have asked for a more perfect day... when we got back we macked it to the girls who were in the rooms across from us.... cuz they were hella hott.... we all chilled that night..... the next day since our bus was broken we couldnt go and ski so we got to chill at the hotel another day.... thats when everyone down here got the storm.... the girls were going home after they skiied, but they couldnt cuz they closed the boarders to massachusetts..... so they cam back to the hotel and we all got to chill one more night... moday morning came.... and no one wanted to get up.... cuz no one was going skiing... the girls left us around 9:30..... we ended up leavin around 11.... we got home at 3:00.... the bus ride home was pretty funn... alot of weird things happened though.... I had the best time of my life.... and for the past 4 days... all I do is go outside in my yard and snowboard.....

I have been thinkin about that soo much and I have no clue why or how I did it... looking back at it I see it was the biggest mistake of my life.. but I fucked up and I have to live with the consequences... she doesnt believe in me anymore... she doesnt care about me anymore.. yet she still loves me??? how does that work??? please tell me... she doesnt think things will work put between us because her parents dont allow her to speak with me... never mind see me... the only reason it wont work is cuz she is scared to stand up to them and tell them that she really does love me and she really does want to be with me... and the only reason she likes other ppl is becasue they have normal families... their families arent fucked up like mine... and cuz they are there during school... and I cant be... you know how people say you never realize how much something meant to you until its gone... while... when she dumped me I never realized how much she meant to me until then... and she means more to me now then she did when she dumps me... and she says that I cause too much drama... well until all her lovely friends got involved in our relationship... there never was drama.. fuckin people should learn to mind their own business...

Lately joey has been being pretty gay... all he is doing now is staying inside and talking to sam and playing video games. No, we dont even get to go in to play with him. Yeah lifes a bitch. Katie, my e-x best friend, well I dunno what she thinks but I honestly dont wanna ever talk to her again cuz all she ever did was rag on Caitlin and I go so sick of it I finally told her off, of course in a nice way.SO we'll see where that leads. I love Caitlin so much. We're doing alot better than lately... She's been doing alot better.... or so it seems... Unless she has learned how to hide it.... I miss her so much. I signed up for the Army. I have to go to the processing station in bostoon tomorrow. I'm leaving tonight. I'm staying in the Embassy Suites... There are madd nice facilities there. Going swimming...

"event","Last night was definately the most sweetest night in my life. We had an FB party. Not only was it good, but it was fuckin great. It was caitlin, Mandi, Alyssa, Kayla, Shauna, Joey, Jon, Sema, Will, Ryan, Oleg, Megan, Megans friend, and Me. We had alot of beer. I had about 10 Smirinovs to myself. I was so gone. Caitlin Had a few, and I didnt keep track of anyone else. It was so great. I was chasing Joey around with a hatchet because he found a case he found my secret stash of Smirinov. I fell on my face so many times. I had so much fun. the greatest thing about it all, was the fact there was no hang over for me. I feel great, except for a little tired but I am always tired. I love the FB crew. Madd good times always, and many many many more to come... Hehe... PeaCe Biotch!!!!!"

"event","As Jon repeatedly asks, ""What is Good?"" The more I think about it, the more I think, ya know, he's right. Yeah, of course there are those few little things that are good here and there, and there is that one good thing that is big, but thats not much compared to how much there is in life that could possibly be good. Like right now, my one thing that is good and big, is how I have been brought back into my good life, with my true friends, and a little thing, is that Caitlin and I are friends, and someday, I doubt its going to be soon, we may get back together, well thats the vibe I feel from her. MeehhhRRRR.... Man I just wish I could see her and give her a hug and kiss. Really thats all I want right now. Thank God I have Jon, Joey, and Sema. I'd really be all like fucked up if they didnt like take me back. I love them. They are the best, I will never find anyone that will ever be able to replace them. I pierced my right ear... Yeah, and I am growing my hair out. I want to Jons friends Kasies last night with him and sema.. we went in the hott tub. Then going from the 101 degree hott tub we jumped into the 50 degree pool... the cold water seriously made my lungs like collapse... it was the coolest feeling in the world.... it felt so refreshing.... we did it again like 15 minutes later.... except I did a cannonball in, and we actually stayed in for like 15 seconds, and the second time it was jus jon and me... the first time it was me sema and jon... and like a half an hour after the second time, jon and I did it a third time cuz we were getting really hott from the hott tub. We swam from the deep end to the shallow end... it was very refreshing. Today was slow... I stayed in all day, and I ended up maknig a custome hackeysack for caitlin... and I shot myself in the hand with a powerfull bebe gnu... it still hurts... meehhhhrrrr.... well I gtg... PeaCe~"

"event","Yeah, Chink night was great. Lots of fun. I wrote Caitlin a 5 page note, telling her pretty much everything. She wrote back. She was tellin me how much she misses me and how much she thinks about me and all this shit, then when she goes to sign it she writes love always, then fuckin says, (but only as friends) how messed up is that. I dunno man, of Course I am always gunna care, but I really dont want to cuz I really think she doesnt care anymore. I dont know, and I never can get everything out of her. so I will never really know what the fuck to think. its so messed up. I dunno what to do. I really dont. I mean I love her more than anything in the world, and she told me she did, and then she doesnt and then she did, now its only as friends I have no clue what to believe anymore. I dont know what to do. I am gettin fed up with all this bullshit with changing her story every 2 days."

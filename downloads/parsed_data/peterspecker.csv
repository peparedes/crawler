Here is what Jameson looked like in 2006:

My gf and I were watching some porn last night.  I'd actually never seen Jenna Jameson in porn before, so I got a DVD that had sex scenes from a bunch of her movies.  Honestly, I was kind of disappointed.  Her boobs seem INCREDIBLY fake.  And she certainly seemed into what she was doing, but not in a way that was anything special for a porn star.  In the ones I saw, she looked very young and had a girlish voice, so maybe some guys are really into that, but it didn't do much for me.  

But I know she's immensely popular.  What do other people think of Jenna Jameson?"

<br />Intelligence is most important in a boyfriend/girlfriend.  You like to be able to talk about everything that is on your mind, and if your partner can't keep up, well, you know.  You are very attracted to someone who can challenge you, and make you see things in a whole new way.<br />

"event","I've noticed something on dating sites that surprises me a little.  I hope I'm not being TOO narrow minded, but I find it odd that there are so many women who are in their 40s (their early 40s, admittedly) who say they don't want to date any guys not interested in having kids.  And by ""having kids"" I don't mean becoming a stepfather to the kids they already have; I mean they only want guys who are interested in helping them to conceive their <I>first</I> children.

I know this is hardly biologically impossible.  My mom had me when she was 46.  But I was the fifth of five kids, and she'd been married for twenty years by then.  And it's not like I object to it, or anything.  I just find it surprising that so many women have decided in their early 40s that they NEED to have kids.  

So suppose you're 41 and you meet the man of your dreams this week.  You date for at least a year before getting married (I hope).  Now you're 42.  With a bit of luck,  you'll deliver by the time you're...43?"

I was in one, but it didn't work out.  

The stereotype is that men just want fucks, while women want relationships, but sometimes women are the ones who are afraid of the emotional intimacy.  

And that sucks too."

<B>Scarlett Johansson:  She can convey so much while saying so little.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v338/peter_abelard04/ScarlettJohansseninLiT.jpg"">

Patrick Stewart:  You know you want him!  (Here he is with his girlfriend.  And I assumed he was gay!)
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v338/peter_abelard04/PatrickStewartwithGF.jpg"">

Kate Winslet:  I think I might marry someone like ""Clementine"" (on the left).  That's not a boast, I just think that's the sort of person who could be attracted to me, and I would want back.  (Don't you think?)
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v338/peter_abelard04/KateWinsletinESotSM.jpg""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v338/peter_abelard04/KateWinsletinQuills.jpg"">

Al Pacino:  Cause he's Al-Fucking-Pacino, that's why!
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v338/peter_abelard04/AlPacinoinCarlitosWay.jpg"">

Tina Fey and Jimmy Fallon:  Sometimes you get a two-fer.  Frankly, I'd do either one of 'em!
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v338/peter_abelard04/jimmy_fallon5.jpg"">

Martha Nussbaum:  Yeah, well she's never heard of YOU either!  If you read one of her books, like <I>Love's Knowledge,</I> and you don't want to do her afterwards, you're a shallow pig.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v338/peter_abelard04/MarthaNussbaum.jpg"">

Tony Leung Chiu-Wai:  Just a reminder of how much Chinese men can rock-out-loud:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v338/peter_abelard04/TonyLeungChiu-WaiinHero.jpg"">

Alanis Morissette:  Yeah, I know not everyone finds her attractive or loves her music.  I do both. So screw you.

Bill Murray:  I am him.  (Actually, I kind of look like him in this shot, don't you think?  C'mon!  Just a <I>little?</I>)  <small>""I was caddying for the Dali Lama, and when we were done he said he didn't have any money to tip me, but he did promise that on my deathbed I would achieve total Enlightenment.  So, y'know, I got that going for me.""</small>
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v338/peter_abelard04/venice5.jpg"">

Zhang Ziyi:  Or Ziyi Zhang.  Either way, she's too hot for words.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v338/peter_abelard04/ZhangZiyiinHero.jpg"">

Daniel Patrick Moynihan:  I tried to think of a living man who's sexy for his mind or his achievements.  Couldn't come up with one.  The closest I got was Senator Moynihan, professor, ambassador, senator.  Unfortunately, he's dead.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v338/peter_abelard04/DanielPatrickMoynihan.jpg"">

Kirsten Dunst:  Sometimes I can't watch her  movies because she's so hot it hurts.  (I know that's stupid, but it's true.)
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v338/peter_abelard04/KirstenDunstinESotSM.jpg"">

Harrison Ford:  Oh yeah.  He's STILL got it going on!

And, last but not least, my Alyson Hannigan and Sarah Michelle Gellar fetishes are well-known to all:

I should have forgotten you long ago
But you're in every song I know
Whining and pining is wrong and so
On and so forth, of course of course,
But no, you can't have a divorce

I haven't seen you in ages
But it's not as bleak as it seems
We still dance on whirling stages
In my Busby Berkeley dreams
The tears have stained all the pages
Of my True Romance magazines
We still dance in my outrageously beautiful
Busby Berkeley dreams

And now you want to leave me for good
I refuse to believe you could
You forget we're not made of wood
Well darling you may do your worst
Because you'll have to kill me first

I haven't seen you in ages
But it's not as bleak as it seems
We still dance on whirling stages
In my Busby Berkeley dreams

We still dance in my outrageously beautiful
Busby Berkeley dreams

Do you think it's dangerous
To have Busby Berkeley dreams?

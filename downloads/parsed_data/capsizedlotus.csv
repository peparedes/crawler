its crackling into the fireplace
falling in through the flu
and the draw just barely
turns and stirs the hair on my arms
cannot be disturbed
slow falling of standstill
bringing transport to its knees
not yet that cold
as it stings against my skin
could I float away on the updrafts and settle 
just far enough to be indistinguishable
from everything else
a bare woman shaped
frosting bump

Overture

We sang a song this morning
my voice doesnt carry
but her voice sounds like Bette Davis
as a child and we laughed 
her mirth caught from mine
her swallowed soprano about a hag
named magdelina

We sang a song last night
your bass and my alto in
a smile that caught somewhere 
in a laugh of a joke
that only we would understand
little secrets mortar the
gaps of history we overcame

There was a chorus this afternoon
small voices and large in 
a strangled effort born of a dream
to teach our children music of our history
but the eldest was right
that decade just produced bad sounds
and a lot of hair
so we sang the Beatles instead"

transfixed and stuck
when The bronze, out of context in its spot
a place of standing without pretext for appreciation
but I understood
the embrace was no longer a sight of longing
but a gentle kneading and reviving of a feeling
fallen
comprehension of the embrace
I know that caress
the hand cradling waves of auburn
a hand resting gently while all other concious 
being is sharp focused on the touch elsewhere
a realization that somewhere
I had already fallen and was in deep understanding
of a passion of my own
reflected in anothers eyes from fifty years ago
caught
knowing the artist understood, rahter than desired.
Knowing what it felt 
to satiate on familiar and adored rather 
than to only hunger"

hes not what they all expected

creating is stilted when
one fights to not be abused

from different angles

side berating the protector was not a complication 
that I expected out of anyone but the 
women I counsel
the bitter irony to be the victim

floating around in here somehwere
I have tea and that is good
and flannel wich is good
and a trip coming
wich is also good
But thinking is like waterwalking
need a bloody miracle to
put head on the keyboard
wading today

Got invited to a rock swap with a co-worker
and spelunking
wich I thougth was somethng funny
at first

dark places with a hammer looking 
for natural treasure.
Maybe."

outlining where I leaned up against my car
smoking and thinking 
as they seem to only come together these days
talking to a friend who was 
going on again for love of
hideous gas powered 
speed on snow
and trying to speak me into
riding
I told her I was
going walking
on webbed feet platforms
but that it was a miserable 
trip these days
because the trees smell like deisel and the
noise sends 
everything but me 
wich is faster out of the way"

with extra relish.
Backentries from the paper scratchings... but you dont get the \\\//\\\\\//\/\ and the whirlies in the margins

and somehow he knew that
it had a memory in it
and he sulks 
making me want to scream
becase I still feel the pain
but its history
its HISTORY
and its his big deal
anyway
I just really like the song 
regardless"

The fuck I&#39;m squeeing about most is the fact that last night he brought up Adventure Games, being like, &quot;Ok, QfG4- best of the series, or best of the series?&quot;&nbsp; Which of course gave me Melissa-boners.&nbsp; We end up having a long conversation about Adventure games (ahh, the nerd mating dance!).&nbsp; Finally, I ask him if he&#39;s played my favorite indie adventure game.&nbsp; I am omitting the name for privacy reasons.&nbsp; But he went: &quot;... what?&nbsp; That&#39;s my name.&quot;

Yes, the boy I have been flirting with has the same name as my favorite adventure game protagonist.

"event","Whabam!  Life has blown up all in my face!  I am highly stressed out right now, to say the least.  The play that I'm working on currently, Raised in Captivity, is hitting some pitfalls.

1) We have yet to rehearse in the space we are performing in.  We are now less than 2 weeks from tech week, and neither the actors NOR THE DESIGNERS have gotten to work in the space really.  Luckily, we're working from a rep plot and have a  minimalist set, but this is getting a bit ridiculous.  It's hard to stage things in a room 2/3 the size of the actual stage.

2) Our props mistress and dramaturg both dropped out 2 weeks before tech week.  WHAT THE FUCK??!?!?  While props had a significant job, the dramaturg had 1 fucking job to do, and decides 2 MONTHS IN that she can't do it.  Dumb fucking cunt!  Seriously, all she had to do was schedule a panel discussion for one of the performances, and she had 3 months to do it in, and 3 weeks before the performance she says she doesn't have enough time.  Same thing with props- we've needed these props all along, and now she says that she doesn't have enough time to go and buy them, but she's sure Michael and I will have the time to go get them.  Riiiiight, cause we're in rehearsal 20 hours a week, and the Director and the Stage Manager don't have other shit to do, nope...  So now Michael, the director, has taken on the panel discussion responsibility, and I'm both SM and props mistress.  Great!

3)  Scheduling blows donkey balls.  The Production Manager (a professor in the department) has yet to get back to us on rehearsal space.  Our actors have scheduling conflicts out the wazoo, some of which being a grandfather's wake and funeral, a sister's wedding, other performance dates, and trapeze classes.  &gt;.&lt;  Some of these can't be helped (family death being the main example), but it's still frustrating to have to cancel rehearsals and slowly get behind when we're already crunched for time.

So right now I desperately need some time to get to Walmart and Joanne Fabrics.  I'm going to try to take the bus there Thursday night, that's the only day I have a night off.  Anyone who wants to come with me and help me keep my sanity is more than welcome.  Also, coming to visit in the afternoons for Tea is highly encouraged.

So thanks for listening to me vent.  I'm still kinda twitchy though.  

<hr>

Oh, and also, Cute Girl has IMed me a few times over the weekend, and is all like, ""So am I going to see you again?""  So that's also now in the back of my mind, because I really like her personality.  And, as my friends have pointed out, ""She has really great boobies.""  (That is a direct quote from Girl's Night last Saturday).  The thing is, with all this shit going on, I just don't have the energy to play a cat and mouse game with her.  I would love to see her again, but I don't know if I can be suave.  Cause, you know, I'm sooooo suave with the ladies...



Ok, DRAMAZZ is over.  For now."

One thing I wonder is if everyone in game thinks I'm just like my character.&nbsp; I mean, I don't really talk to many of them outside of the game - to be honest I don't know most of their actual names!&nbsp; But I would like people to know that I'm not a stuffy sex-crazed elitist whore in real life.&nbsp; Ah well, c'est la vie.&nbsp; 


Anywho, on Sunday, Joe's family was supposed to come out for lunch, but due to his dad's friend's recent death they could not make it.&nbsp; So Joe and I went to Northampton ourselves for the afternoon.&nbsp; We went to Sparky's American Food and had burgers, which were AWFUL.&nbsp; They were overpriced, because they were organic free range meats, and they were cooked badly and in small portions.&nbsp; Perhaps their hot dogs are good, but so far I give them two thumbs down.&nbsp; Then we walked around, attempting to window shop, but nearly everything was closed due to Zombie Bunny Jesus Day.&nbsp; Ah well.

<lj-cut text=""Problem behind cut.  "">It started by locking up a few times for no reason. Then, when I rebooted one time, it didn't connect to the internet. After some searching, I discovered in the device manager an error ""Code 12"" - ""There are not enough free resources to run this device."" on both my wireless card and my regular network card. Since then, I have:
 
 Uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers (did nothing)
 Checked which resources their supposedly sharing (Error, doesn't list which resouces it's using)
 Disabled one at a time (did nothing)
 Loaded to my last known good config (did nothing)
 Full System restore to a few days before (error message, stopped keyboard from working)
 Uninstalled my keyboard drivers and reinstalled (fixed keyboard)
 Downloaded new drivers from Dell, and reinstalled (did nothing)
 Flashed the BIOS to updated version (Dell update is broken, tho they won't admit it, but it lists that on their website)
 Flashed BIOS to Previous version (Error: Not enough memory to complete, reboot and try again? Nope, still not enough memory)
 Flashed BIOS with current version (Same error as previous)
 Listened to tech support go ""...whoa.  huh."" at least 15 times
 Deleted the partition from my harddrive, reformatted, and reinstalled XP (action completed, problem still there)
 Uninstalled and reinstalled updated drivers (did nothing)
 Tried Flashing BIOS again (same errors as before)
 Banged head on desk repeatedly.
 
 
 
 Next step: wait for Dell technician to come and replace the two network cards/adaptors.
 
 My laptop is under full warranty, even if I took a hammer to it, so no worries there. It's just frustrating, because out of the 6 people I've talked to for tech support, 2 have helped me. Those 2 have been my roommate, and my dad. Dell tech support are idiots. Also, all of the ones on the hardware like are French.</lj-cut>


So anywho, yeah...  I've been using the school computers for basic email type stuff.  Argh.  

Life To-Do List:

-  Find a 4 br apartment for Joe, Ian, Dan, and myself, in the Amherst/Noho area, that is less that $450 a month per person including utilities.

-  Keep working on play, even though lead actress just dropped out because it was too stressful for her.

-  Figure out what's going on with cute girl that I like so much, but who never calls and has blown me off 2x now.  Perhaps give up.

-  Replace my student ID that I lost months ago.

This afternoon I'm going to the Mart that sells Wal, to buy fabric and an 8in crescent wrench.  Huzzah!  Please call me if you'd like to join in.  Then this evening I will be hanging out with Joe, Sarahtron, and the Splendiferous Blake!  More Huzzah!

And now they're kicking me out of the room I'm in.  Argh."

It was really nice to catch up with him.  We hadn't really talked since Craig and I broke up, so a lot had changed since then, obviously.

I've been so friggin social this semester.  I was in my room last night, and I realized that I'm generally at my house for maybe 10 hours a day at most, usually 7 spent sleeping.  I'm either in the car, at school, or at Joe's.  It's ridiculous!  But I like it.  I've never liked just staying at home, and for once I don't have to.  It's kinda scary though, I have a spare toothbrush at Joe's house, and he's constantly finding clothing, makeup, and other stuff I just leave at his house by accident.

I hang out with my friend Steph a lot too, which is awesome.  It's great to have a female friend that I can talk about boys, girls, sex, folk singers, environmental activism, and well... everything with!  We often do lunch on Tues/Thurs, and go to crunchy places like Big Fresh or Panera.  I wonder if we'll do something today.

See, because my car is defunct and I haven't been able to get a real job to afford one since my back went out, the plan for this semester is to drive with my mom to her job at Framingham State and then head to Massbay, since I don't have to be there till 9.  Then I leave school around 4 to pick her up and go home.  Seems simple enough, yes?

Cept for the fact that my mom doesn't drive in snow.  She hates the snow.  And she's a friggin paranoid nervous driver, she won't drive at night, in bad rain, or any winter weather really.  So this morning consisted of her staying in her pjs staring at the TV weather reports saying, ""... maybe I'll go in later...""  Seeing as my classes are at 10 and 11, it kinda made a difference how late she was going to try!

But she saw a plow go by our street, and we had already shoveled and heated up the car (we had had 2 previous fake-outs of ""I think I might go...""), so she's just like, ""Ok, we're going!""

So we head out down our street which is only half plowed, but it's a tiny side road so that's expected.  We get to the end of the street, and my mom's looking at the main road and the stream of cars on it which are all going slow, and she starts to freak out a bit.  She turns onto it, and we don't even go 50 feet before she goes, ""AH!  They haven't plowed or sanded, we're turning around!!""  So we turn around after going less than a quarter of a mile, (even though they had plowed and sanded though it needed to be again).

As we turn around, we see 4 cars behind us is a plow and a sander.  >,<  So the road was rapidly becoming clear.  We still head home.  Now my mom is still fretting in front of the TV.

Worst part is, it's not like I can just take the car and go myself.  She's still ""planning on going sometime later... but much too late for you to go.""  Argh!!  So there goes the first day of school..."

But enough of the sap.  Semester is almost over, and I'm stoked.  I have a month off, and no job, and nothing to do!  It sounds like tons of fun... but I really need a job.  I'm not sure what to look for.  Since I'm not supposed to life anything, I'm a little confused as to where I should look.  I'm looking for evenings and weekends, and waitressing would be perfect for that, but since I'm not supposed to lift... *sigh*  If anyone has any ideas of job prospects, feel free to send them my way.

I really want to go to <lj user=""jddyslexia"">'s New Year's party, but my mother recently informed me that New Bedford is a scary place and so she doesn't want her car to stay there overnight.  Since I can't afford to replace my car right now, I can't really rail against her rules...  If anyone's willing to give me a ride from Medway for New Years to New Bedford, I'd love you forever..."

<b>Monday</b>- Went home sick from work, but wasn't really sick.  Just didn't want to work.  ^.^  Monday night I drove to Needham to hang out with my friend Jeremy.  He just gave me his address and I mapquested it... so after an hour of driving back and forth past his street <i>because the street sign was missing</i>, I finally got to his house.  He laughed at me for getting lost.  Jerk!  We had fun though, talked about astrology and science fiction and taking over the world.  I stayed till 1:30 watching Aqua Teen Hunger Force and looking at  funny internet things.  ^.^

<b>Tuesday</b>- Went and had dinner with Marco and watched a little bit of anime, then we went un-bowling with a group of kids from high school.  The bowling lanes neglected to tell us when we called that it was league night, and they had no lanes open.  >.<  So we all went to Friendly's and had food and ice cream, and 8 of us crammed around a 6 person table.  Hilarity ensued.

<b>Wednesday</b>- I drove out to South Boston/Dorchester to visit the most fabulous, stylish, and awesome <lj user=""polarisenvy"">.  We went to Diesel Cafe and caught up on each others lives and had coffee and such.  Then we attempted to go to the All Asia where they were supposed to be spinning alternative music,  but it was more... empty.  There were maybe 5 people there.  So we left and went  back to his place.  Ooh la la!  Hehe, we stayed up late and talked, I love that kid!

<b>Thursday</b>- I found myself traveling west, to go kidnap the lovely <lj user=""mandalin""> for lunch.  Rather, we went to Applebee's for lunch, I did not in fact eat her.  We had a wicked fun time, and went and raided Barnes and Noble.  I've decided I must kidnap her on a regular basis now.  ^.^
Thursday night I was supposed to hang out with Jeremy again, but he canceled, just because he has an unknown dehabilitating illness (I think it's mono).  Psh, what was he thinking?  Anywho, I ended up hanging out with Lauren and Brian, and we watched <u>The Girl Next Door</u>.  Of all the angsty teen movies I've had to sit through, this was one of the worst.  >.<  But hanging out with them was wicked fun anyways.

<b>Friday</b>- Worked.  blargh.  and now... cleaning until my aunt arrives... and then... being a loser and hanging out online.  lol

But overall, awesome week!"

Some of the sets were improvised that day.  I am the stage manager... and the only crew member.  2 acts, 7 scenes each, each a major scene change.  >.<

Only one thing possible could have made it worse, and it did.  I was sick.  By the time of the end of the show, I was pouring sweat, and had trouble standing.  I made it home (a 45 min drive due to traffic) and literally passed out after taking some cold medicine.  Luckily, when I woke up 5 hours later, I felt alot better, and had dinner.

Anywho, my plans for the upcoming week;

Monday (Tonight)- Hanging out with my friend Jeremy from Massbay.  We are watching Dune and looking at astrological charts.  Yay!
Tuesday-  I would like to get in touch with my friend <lj user=""mandalin"">, to possibly hang out with the awesomeness that is her.  If you're reading this, IM me: nynaevesangreal!
Wednesday- Hanging out with a wicked cool kid I haven't seen in <i>forever</i>, I'm so excited.  I'm going to visit Doug in the big scary city, and we are perhaps going to Diesel Cafe and then going dancing.  Whee!
Thursday- __________________ (this means no plans as of yet)
Friday- Work! >,<
Saturday & Sunday- the goddamn play again.

Now, it's time to go to work, ugh.

- Craig brought me a dozen red roses at work.  *cue the ""awwww""s*  It was really sweet.  Cept for the fact that I've told him a <i>million</i> times that I don't really like roses, and if he does get me roses not red ones, but really I prefer irises or other flowers.  Bah.  hehe, he meant well, and I love him, so that's all that matters. 

- During my lunch break, I went out and quick got him something (guilt for not remember to do something).  I got him a card and a big stuffed doggy.  I left them in his car, so he'd see them before he left for work.  He came into the bank right before he had to leave, and told me the story of his finding them:

Apparently, he didn't notice the larged stuffed animal in his car till he opened the door.  He looked and thought ""Cujo!"" and jumped a foot back.  Onto a piece of black ice.  Whereupon he pulled a Home Alone-esque fall, flat onto his back.  He immediately jumped up, believing a dog was about to kill him.

Was it wrong for me to laugh hysterically when I heard that?  ^,^  

Anyway, he was fine, and he thought it was also funny.  Whee!

We went for coffee at Meldiva's, and then went to Barne's and Nobles, then to Blockbuster.  Ahh, the plentiful ways to amuse oneself in suburbia.

I've noticed that I'm becoming really obsessive about my research into Christianity and the like.  I'm not sure if I'm just subconciously trying to assert my intelligence because of my feelings of inferiority, or if it's because I really have nothing else to talk about.  Maybe a bit of both?  In either case, there are a billion books at Barnes and Noble that I want!!!

I *LOVE* school.  I'm such a geekazoid, it's awesome.  I'm taking a clusterfuck of humanities courses: History, Drawing, Anthropology, Religion, and Communication.  Woo!

On my first day of Oral Communications class, the professor starts her lecture, she's a nice middle-aged Austrailian woman, and she happened to call on me, and asked me what I was majoring in, etc.  I explained how I planned to major in theater with a focus in stage management and directing, and she replies, ""Oh, I'm the head of the theater department here.  Do you need a job?  I need a stage manager for my next show.  Don't worry, it's paid.""  To which I replies, ""Buhhh, duhh, uhh..."" in complete shock.  She was like, ""Ok, good, you're hired.""

A cute boy I stared at around campus all last semester is in 2 of my classes this year.  He seems very cool.  I want to be his friend.  Not his ""friend"", just platonic like.  He's totally my type though: tall, shaved head, wears all black in the stylish goth way (versus Hot Topicish) and a black trenchcoat, with glasses that make him look smart.  Last year I played chess with him once in the cafeteria, he brings a set with him at all times I think.  Also, the first day he wore a shirt that said ""What Would Cthulu Do?"" and was drinking coffee from a Wizards of the Coast mug.   
I definitely want to be his friend!

I'm going to see the Producers with my sister, Wed the 23rd.  I got incredibly cheap tickets through school, $15 for front row balcony seats, towards the center on an aisle!!!!  Normally it's over $80 for tix like that.  I'm incredibly stoked, and I'm just hoping I don't get murdered by my fellow theater aficionado friends.  And Craig.  I didn't invite him, cause I know he's not a huge musical fan... but I forgot that he <i>loves</i> Mel Brooks.  Eep.  He couldn't have gone anyway, he's working, but he's still pissed.  Oh well, c'est la vie.

Our 1 year anniversary is the 15th.  I'm not an anniversary kinda person, and seeing as we had been having sex for months before that as ""friends"", people ask why we bother, and have a specific date. (My Mom asked. *sigh*)  To this I replied that it's the first time we told each other we loved each other, and for that it's special.  So in conclusion, I am a huge giant smushy monster of girly hormonic danger.

<hr>
P.S. I miss seeing EVERYONE."

-Lose weight, about 35 - 40 lbs.  Also, get in shape, both core stomach muscles, and arm muscles.  (these are all for medical reasons, mandated by my doctor, for those of you who try to be nice and say ""oh, you're fine!"", cause I'm not)

-Fill out all summer theater and college applications by the end of February at the latest.  

-Figure out a way of organizing my room that I can live with and maintain.

-Have a huge kickass 21st birthday, where I really do something extravagent. (June 16th people, only 152 days away!)

I think that's about it.

"event","my mind seems to be racing at a million miles an hour lately.  I have so much that needs to get done, but it's so hard to get over the little speedbumps, let alone start tackling the mountains I've built up.  It's amazing how your emotional relationship can make or break the other aspects of your life.  

It's times like these where I totally bond with my Ani Difranco Cds.  And yes, I know how cliche, wanna-be feminist, indie-arty girl it is.  I can't help it though.  Alot of what she says just hits me.

I crave change.  I want to dance, to revel, to be happy and spending energy, I'm tired of relaxing, tired of not struggling.  To me, happiness comes after you've accomplished something.  Maybe that's the biproduct of growing up in a Puritan society with it's values on work ethics, but regardless, I've been feeling like... I'm not living up to my potential.  So many things are holding me back, but at the same time the only thing holding me back is me, and the obstacles I've put in my way.

I feel really friggin old.  I feel old, and I'm 20.  I always used to feel like the young one, the immature one, always trying to act older.  Now I just feel old, I've actually succeeded in advancing time like I've always tried to.  I used to laugh at everything, I was lighthearted, I never stopped joking.  Now people tell me to stop being so serious, to lighten up.  

I want to blame it on Craig, but it's me.  I know I need to change, that I'm the one who's stagnating.  What I don't know is if he can be with me while I change, or if it would be better for me to be alone.  I don't know what's fair, or what's right, or what's real.  

<i>what kind of paradise am i looking for?
i've got everything i want and still i want more</i>

I miss art.  I miss theater.  I miss new music.  I miss philosophical debates with friends over nonsense hypothetical situations.  I miss photography.  I miss writing poetry.  I miss going to coffee shops alone and just sitting, people watching, listening to angsty girl music, and just contemplating.  I miss getting in touch with my spiritual side.  I miss exercising on a regular basis.  I miss that feeling of anticipation and excitement when you see someone you really like being with.  I miss geek talk, and being an utter nerd.  I miss girl talk, but not the vapid bankgirl talk, the real women conversations.  I miss being entirely alone.  I miss being surrounded by friends who aren't afraid to say things that might possibly piss me off... or make me laugh.

<i>when you look at me
you see my purpose,
see my pride
you think i just saddle up my anger
and ride and ride and ride
you think i stand so firm
you think i sit so high on my trusty steed
let me tell you
i'm usually face down on the ground
when there's a stampede</i>"

I could see it happening...

<hr>
so I talked to Craig about how I was feeling.  He actually called me, he had picked up the vibe of me being not ok.  I was pretty straight with him on how I was feeling.  I don't know what's going to happen, or what I should do, but it's the least I can do to be honest with him that I'm feeling confused.

Ok, bedtime."

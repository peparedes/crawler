The increased mobility takes the pressure off of her elbow, reducing the opportunity for tendoitis in that joint.

C politely agreed with me when I told him he would probably be able to do more at the Jamboree if I were not there.  He said the Arts/Science Expo personnel told him his inlaid-wood turned cup was the runner-up to the grand-prize winning entry. Apparently the judges had a hard time deciding. The winner did a quilt of Van Gogh's ""Starry Night.""  I suspect it won because it was a larger, more complicated work. C's was small but required much precision.

Having a buddy is part of the Scout safety system; I just hoped my loner son would find someone to pal around with.  He's staying as hydrated as he can in the heat.

I can empathize with jkgeroo's lament on what one does with one's time. Today I finally tackled my dreaded summer project: cleaning C's room. The joke is that it gets cleaned once a year, whether it needs it or not. Believe me, it needs it even more regularly than that! Surprisingly, I'm not as tired this year. Maybe it is neater than it was in the past. I noticed a file system I set up for him last year is still in place, so that helped to organize some random papers. I'm not yet finished, but the end is in sight. I've had some years when it's taken three or four days to complete!  I believe listening to the Focus on the Family's version of ""The Silver Chair"" helped pass the time more pleasurably, too.

A tidbit from today: We passed a daycare center on Tidewater Drive, and V remembered how I didn't like to put them in daycare, even for ladies' Bible studies in Japan.  I said it was because C got so many ear infections from catching colds there. He also had what I call the ""second child syndrome,"" meaning he collected not only all the germs he could on his own, but also all the germs shared with him by his older sister!

Then I said that I believed C got the chicken pox from the child care center on the Sasebo Navy Base. He had them first, then V had them. (This was just about the time the vaccine came out, but being in Japan, we didn't have easy access to it.)  

That gave V some ammunition:  ""Oh, so he gave me the chicken pox!"" 

C's quick reply, ""Now V, that was a service.""  

A service!  I'll never think of chicken pox the same way again.  Nevertheless, I hope my grandchildren will be vaccinated against it.  Even if they get it, it will be a lighter case than what V and C lived through."

We also called in another report last night because a man came around selling some type of cleaning supplies (less expensive than Windex) at 9:15 p.m. That's a little late for door-to-door. Our neighborhood also has a ""No Solicitors"" policy, not that people generally notice or obey!  Anyway, it was a little creepy. Again, the homeowners' association has asked us to report these things to the non-emergency police line.  I wonder what that was all about.

A woman V works with lives in Colonial Place and said there was a man going around door to door asking if the homeowner had a security system and offering to install one.  It was a scam, and he was caught. He just wanted to figure out what houses were easy targets.

I'll stop  the crime report and share the nature news.  I saw a bunny on my front walkway the other night nibbling at my weeds and devouring my yellow marigolds!  Cute.  Now if I could just teach it to eat the spent marigolds, I wouldn't have to go out and deadhead them.

I asked the airline agent, who assured me her flight was coming in at 7:30. Meanwhile, I wondered where she was going to land. I had booked the flight on line; had I had a ""senior moment"" and sent her to Norfolk, Nebraska instead of here?  It was a relief and joy to see her smiling face and learn her flight was uneventful.  Uneventful is good.

Candy welcomed her sister with a show of pretties and settled down in a cat nest by Va.'s  feet. It is sweet to have a little animal who remembers and loves Va., even though she is gone far more than she is here.

The hours flew by as I listened to WHRV and the reports from the BBC about the bombings in London today.  It is hard to believe we were there just two months ago, and though I do not recall going through the stations that were bombed, our transportation would certainly have been distrupted if we were there now.  That, of course, would be a ""temporary light affliction"" compared to the pain and sorrow many are experiencing there.  V wrote and said she want through the King's Cross-St. Pancras station all the time, and that is the one that sustained the most damage and loss of life, I believe.

Tonight I listened to the first of ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" CDs.  Candy became fascinated, too, and sat on the kitchen desk with her little face pointed toward the CD player.  I wonder what she was thinking.  I believe she liked hearing about Aslan. He's a cat, after all.

June 10 - 11 V and I went to PA so she could attend the wedding of a friend from college.  The ride up was incredible. It took 10 hours to get from Norfolk to Dillsburg, PA, a suburb of Harrisburg. We did stop in Fredericksburg for lunch for an hour, then again near Gettysburg for a quick dinner and gasoline, but what slowed us down the most was traffic. Road construction and Friday afternoon traffic delayed our arrival.  Nevertheless, we did arrive safely, which was an answer to prayer. V and a college friend spent the night with some friends of the bride; I found my way to a lovely bed and breakfast.  It turned out to be less expensive and more relaxing than the Hampton Inn. The hostess kindly advised me on activities for Saturday -- since I wasn't attending the wedding and just had to wait for my little violinist to show up.  I went to the outlet mall in Gettysburg (tax-free shopping) and two garden/gift shop-type places.  Since these are things I seldom do in my normal, everyday life, they were a pleasant change.  

V appeared at 6 p.m., and since I wasn't very tired, we decided to press toward home that night, if possible.  The traffic going home was very light; we made it home in 6.5 hours, with just a quick stop at at Wendy's in Fredericksburg.  Those of you who know me know I absolutely despise interstate driving, especially around here, where people are rude. Anyway, we came home via Route 17, which is very dark at night.  : )  Along the way we saw two deer, two cats, some unidentified slinking animal, and an animal's leg alongside the road.  We also smelled a skunk someone had hit! : X  Again, our prayers were answered, and we made it home safely.  It was nice to be home and not to need to travel on Sunday.

Last week was spent getting V and C ready to go to their festival and camp, respectively.  My father was supposed to have a doctor's appointment, but since he's stable, the doctor canceled it.  E was at the PCA General Assembly in Chattanooga June 14-17.  He took us out to eat at the Cheesecake Factory when he returned.  While it was nice not to have to cook, I think I prefer a quieter restaurant.  

My dad came over for dinner on the 13th and the 18th, the latter for an early Father's Day celebration.

June 19 was my 22nd wedding anniversary!  It was also the day my children left -- V for Indiana until July 17; C for Pipsico. He will be home every weekend and have to go back the next day.

Monday was so cool I decided to push on with my neglected gardening.  I finally finished weeding and planting and received two compliments from my neighbors for my efforts.  I planted yellow marigolds, red salvia, and blue ageratum.  The colors offer a strong contrast.  The flowers I planted a month or so ago are much more established and vigorous than the ones I just put in, but at least my knee-high weeds are gone. : )

E and I went to Williamsburg on Tuesday to celebrate our anniversary.  What a lovely day. It was warmer than it was on Monday, but it was still very pleasant and not at all humid.  I've been to Williamsburg on muggy summer days, and it isn't delightful.  Anyway, we wandered around Merchants Square, then went out of the historic area for lunch at the Old Chickahominy House Restaurant.  We were told we'd have to wait 45 minutes for seating (it's popular), but it turned out that we were seated within minutes.  We both had fruit salad and ham biscuits. E had Brunswick stew. For dessert he had coconut pie and I had chocolate (no surprise).  

This restaurant has a resident cat, Mr. Biscuit, whose birthday is being celebrated there tomorrow from 2:30 - 4 p.m.  I wonder if he knows.

After lunch, we returned to the historic area and went to the DeWitt Wallace Museum. We spent most of our time there looking at the Folk Art temporarily on display while tha Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum is being moved and expanded.  Afterward, we went to a talk and demonstration on the development of the banjo.  We left early to avoid getting caught in traffic.

Yesterday I worked in V's room to clean it up a bit so someone from Hopewell can stay there next week during the church mission project. 

I also had a call from our cousin yesterday, and E's aunt (who has been at death's door for YEARS), died. The funeral is Saturday -- sometime -- in Great Bridge.  As I told E, the surprise isn't that she died, but that she lived so long in such a debilitated state.

Yesterday would have been my mom's 85th birthday.

I took my father to the cardiologist yesterday, and he said dad is stable now and doesn't need to come back for a year. Of course, if he needs to be seen earlier than that, he can be seen.  This is the first summer in three that his health has been ""stable,"" so I am very thankful.  He still has appointments, but just not every week.  

Candy must sense it is hot outside, because when I brush her, she is full of loose hair!  She's here now  squeezing her eyes at me and wanting to be admired."

"event","This morning's frustration:  trying to talk to Tricare and Bon Secours about my dad's medical bill.  Thanks to the Hippa laws, they didn't want to talk to me because I am not him.  My dad doesn't want to deal with these things.  I did find out that maybe Bon Secours needed to use a different code for Tricare to pay its part of the bill, so I passed that on to Bon Secours. I ended up going to my dad's and having him talk to Bon Secours and authorizing me to talk to them.  The woman I spoke to was very helpful and kind -- which is what I needed at that point!  I also am sending Tricare a copy of my power of attorney for my dad -- and a copy of mom's death certificate -- so they will know I am the next-of-kin and they can discuss his medical payments with me. That's not my goal in life, but it will be easier for me someday, I suspect, if this detail is established.

This afternoon's frustration:  our TV wouldn't work. Eventually we were able to get sound on it, but no picture. So we listened to part of the news (more on THAT below).  We wondered if the VCR/DVD was not working, so E put the old VCR on. The TV still didn't work.  C, who has an innate genius for this sort of thing, wasn't able to figure it out.  When we came home from church, V told us the TV would work if the VCR was off. C suggested we try to get new cables; perhaps the old ones weren't working well.  E checked the cables again and tightened up one of them -- and now all is working again.

A mystery solved, thanks to listening to tonight's news:  Last week E wondered why we hadn't yet received our income tax refund. The IRS claimed it never reached them.  Fortunately, we always send our tax returns certified with a return receipt, so we knew it arrived in Fresno, CA. (Why Fresno?)  I made a copy of our copy of the tax return. We called our accountant to ask him to sign the tax form. That was on Friday.  I wondered today why we hadn't heard from him but figured he might be out of town on vacation.

His name came up on what we heard on tonight's news. Apparently he was beaten last week and left in the middle of a road in Chesapeake. He died from head injuries today.  E and I were speechless as we heard the news.  I believe the case is being treated as a murder.  

My guess is that this man was not a believer.  I do not know if he had any family.  

So I had a lesson in perspective today.  The frustrations of medical insurance, modern technology, and the IRS are nothing compared to what it must be like to face the Lord without Christ as Savior."

(I'm not sure where she did her comparative study, but I'll accept that as truth!)


Down: My father called and has some medical bill from his ER visit in January. We don't know why his insurance didn't cover it. This will be my project. Sigh.


Neither up nor down, just more to do:  C's Scoutmaster is retiring tonight, and I have refreshments to commemorate the event. He's been a good scoutmaster and an encouragement to C, but his son is graduating from High School, and he believes it is time to move on and let someone else have the job of scoutmaster.  Anyway, C has just next Tuesday's meeting to attend, then he'll either be at summer camp or the national jamboree until Aug. 3."

"event","Three conversations with my daughter:

1. V commented on my prominent cheekbones.  I asked her why they were significant. ""They make you look rugged.""  

Great. I look like John Wayne.  Rugged!


2. I woke V up from a nap yesterday.  Her first comment was, ""Don't you think stuffed animals add another layer to life?""  I replied that I like stuffed animals, even though I am nearly 50 years old. (Well, I still have a few years to go. Don't get excited.)  

A few minutes later, V came downstairs and asked if she had said anything. It turns out she wasn't awake when she made her profound observation about stuffed animals.  


3. This afternoon I tried to calm Candy, who was alarmed by the thunder. ""Don't worry, baby, mama's not going to let those boom-booms hurt you.""  Yes, I talk to the cat that way, and she appreciates it.  That's why she follows me around. 

Her sister told her, ""Candy, your mama has no control over the boom-booms, but I agree that they won't hurt you.""  Now what kind of a comfort is that?

Candy did hide under the bed for a while, but she emerged and stayed on the back steps near the schoolroom. She was very brave.


I take C to the doctor tomorrow for another evaluation of his arm.  

I'm not sure I'm in an artistic mood, but I like the little colored pawprints around the kitty icon."

"event","I worked on the smaller of the two flower beds that border the house today.  The holly bushes needed trimming, so I did that on both sides of the front door, but concentrated my weeding/rearranging/planting efforts on one side.  It took all day.  My right hand is stiff and cramped.  The skin on both hands is rough. (I don't wear garden gloves; it is too hard to get a grip on the plants.)

I am so thankful for my family, who held the ladder while I climed and trimmed the bushes, unloaded the dishwasher, made lunch, prepared hamburgers, went to get my dad (he came over for a cookout), helped cook, helped clean up, etc.  I tried to do most of this work while they were away so I wouldn't have to deal with fixing meals for them, but they rose to the challenge and came to my assistance!  Candy supervised me from her post in the window. I'd look up occasionally from my work to see the pumpkin-masked sweetie gazing at me.

E took us out for frozen custard tonight.

I found V's missing Mendelssohn and Bruch violin concerto CD.  : - )

Tomorrow:  back to school for C and me; work from 10:30-7 for E; V's first day with the Va. Symphony library internship!"

"event","My dreams of putting all my flowerbeds in order in one day came to an end at noon when I'd just finished one of the quarter-round flower beds out front.  I dug up all of the black-eyed susans (basically the entire flower bed), put in manure and peat moss, and replaced some of the black-eyed susans. I also put in red and blue salvia for contrast, so I'll have the yellow-red-blue theme in the flower beds.  I did the second quarter-round bed after lunch.

The plants I didn't reuse went into plastic bags to give to friends who want black-eyed susans.  Even so, I ended up throwing a lot of them away.  The ones I have will soon overgrow the beds; I also have more to deal with in other flower beds.  

When I finished the second flower bed I mowed the lawn, which needed it as it hasn't been mowed in 12 days!  I mowed it last time, too. Is there some pattern here?

I ache. I was not made for manual labor.

E just called from Williamsport, PA.  Traffic was heavy in places, and they stopped at two antique stores (buying nothing), so they didn't get all the way to Houghton. That's fine.  

My dad called to invited me to a cookout (not a barbecue; that's Yankee-talk for a cookout) at his place tomorrow afternoon, but he's out now, so I can't let him know I accept.  

If you didn't follow my comment about cookout vs. barbecue:  in the South, barbecue is seasoned, shredded meat. In the North, barbecue (or barbeque) is a cookout with hamburgers and hotdogs.  

I may need to drive over to my dad's to leave my RSVP."

I will stay home with the hermits, Cookie, and Candy.  My goal is rework the front flowerbeds.  I wonder if I'll last long. I did the back flowerbed over the period of several days and worked on it for three hours Saturday afternoon.  It looks nice, but I was sore from the exertion.  Still, the weeds won't go away without my encouragement! (That is why the little cat has a ""determined"" icon today; I am determined to work in those flower beds.  I didn't know that icon was so cute.  I'll try to be determined more often so I can use it. It reminds me of Candy sneaking up on a toy mouse.)

It was overcast at 5 a.m., so the sun didn't wake me up. I think it was the anticipation of the trip.  I feared going back to sleep and oversleeping, so I stayed up, showered, and went downstairs to let Arthur know we'd like breakfast. He kindly offered to turn on the water for coffee and toaster. He brought out cereals and bread for us.  Afterward, he helped us flag down a taxi, and we were on our way to Victoria Station for the Gatwick Express. We arrived in the nick of time for the 6:45 a.m. train.

As the taxi driver took us to Victoria, C noted, ""Oh, there's Harrods.""  E didn't realize we were so close to that famous department store, but I did.  I reminded him of his proclamation that he didn't want to go to Harrods; that's why I didn't mention it.  (I would't have minded a walk-through, though I don't know when we would have had time.)  Anyway, it turned out that there was a duty-free (no VAT added) Harrods in the airport, so I visited there and bought some cat aprons. They are aprons for people with a cat print, not little aprons fit for Candy to wear.  The aprons are of a laminated cloth, so I won't get my clothes wet -- probably good when washing dishes -- instead of sloshing water on myself.

The line at the Continental counter moved quickly.

We had a second breakfast -- like Hobbits -- at McDonald's at Gatwick, and we were able to pay in dollars.  E found a copy of his favorite newspaper, The International Herald Tribune, in a WH Smith bookstore. 

We went through about three or four security checks before entering the plane. C's belt buckle set off one alarm, so he was wanded.  I was selected for another check at the gate.  Don't I look suspicious?  I surmised it was because of my traveling companions!

On the plane:  The flight monitor says it is 3476 miles to our destination, and the estimated time of arrival is 12:28 p.m. We thought it would be about an hour later.

Today's movie offering is ""Ocean's Twelve,"" a sequel to ""Ocean's Eleven,"" which I didn't see. I lead a sheltered life.

C figured out that our headrests can be bent to supoort our heads so we can nap. I couldn't sleep on the way over, partly because it is hard for me to sleep on a plane, and partly because I had no head support.  Though I tried to nap, announcements kept me awake until the time for the movie.

I took a while to figure out the movie, and I'm not sure I ever figured out who was good and who wasn't, but I did like it and would be willing to watch it again. So much for my face-recognition of stars:  Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts were in the movie, and I didn't realize it until I saw the credits!  Huh -- maybe they aren't as famous as they thought?

Lunch was a chicken cordon bleu entree, a small salad, roll, vegetables, and a chocolate-cherry dessert.

C figured out how to use the video game option on the handset and occupied himself with that for most of the trip.

I saw a second movie, ""Coach Carter,"" about a man who coached a basketball team and grounded them all when some didn't meet academic standards.  I've seen better movies in the same genre.

After the movie, I watched the ""Flight Show,"" which just showed the progress of the plane. I was amazed at the names of places on the map. I've never heard of Chicoutimi or Sept Iles or Timmins, which are all in Canada. Prince Edward Island would be fun to visit and bring to mind all the Anne of Green Gables stories. 

Snack time:  a hot turkey and cheese sandwich with dijonaisse mayonnaise and a scone with clotted cream and strawberry jam -- Yum!

Our time in Newark was hectic.   There were too many people, and most were grumpy.  I was glad to leave.

We were back on the tin-can airplane for the flight to Norfolk. I worked the crossword puzzle in the in-flight magazine with the help of my seat parter, C.

JSy met us at the airport and took us home!  

Candy seemed a bit apprehensive about coming out to see us, but within five minutes she was my constant shadow.  Her head needed continuous scratching, and we were all called upon to fulfill this task.

Overall, it was a wonderful trip. It felt like we had been away forever, yet it was less than two weeks.  When we were in London, our time in Wales and Bath and Leigh Farm seemed very long ago.

The people in the country seemed -- overall -- friendlier than those in the city, with those in Wales being the friendliest. We were well-received and maybe even well-liked at the B-P House. I think having a Scout with us made us like family instead of being part of a massive school group unaffiliated with Scouts.

If I went again, I'd like to spend more time in Wales and also go to Scotland.  I'd like to see Blenheim and Chartwell (Churchill's country home).  I could handle a little but of London (Harrods!), but I wouldn't want to make it my emphasis.  I know there's a lot of wonderful things to see there, but there are great things to see all over the UK, too.  Variety is welcome.

Things I'm glad I brought:  tissues,  camera, camera battery recharger, camera memory cards, international cell phone, phone charger, converter plug,  C's jacket with its zippered inside pocket for holding passports and cell phone, my glasses, tennis shoes, Oil of Olay, motrin, nail clippers, band aids, q-tips, this notebook!

Things I wish I'd brought: a washcloth, extra alkaline batteries for camera when rechargeable ones expire in the middle of the day.

I brought but didn't need:  my contact lenses, soaking solution, and cleaner. It just seemed easier to use glasses, though my vision wasn't as good.  I noticed that after the plane flights, my eyes were particularly dry, either because I'd been up for hours, or the forced air on the plane dried them out.


There you have it!  If you persevered though all of this, I don't know whether you should be commended or condemned!  Thank you for reading, though, and for your encouraging responses, whether posts to this site or by e-mail.    It is good to be home.  The lines have fallen in pleasant places."

"event","12 May 05:  This was our last full day in the  UK.

I woke up at 5:15 to find the sun up and bright. E was awake, but I went back to sleep until 6:45 --  late for me.  I guess I learned that if REALLY tired, I can sleep soundly despite the noise outside and lumpy bed.  Since the cot is narrower than the regular beds, I had to catch myself a few times to keep from falling out.

We went to Windsor today. We took an early (before 9:30 a.m.) tube ride out of Gloucester Road to Waterloo, where we caught the 9:52 train to Windsor. It was a ""local"" train and made lots of stops, so it took an hour to arrive.

C and I were kind of tired.

We wondered if we'd recognize Joan and Clifford after not seeing them since 1985, but we did.  Joan gave C a book, Guide to Prehistoric England.  He was pleased.  I've never known anyone to be so fascinated with old rocks.

We went up to Windsor Castle, which dominates the town. It is the largest castle in the UK. The lines -- or queues -- were long. The outside of the castle is impressive, and what we saw inside was amazing.  We even saw part that was restored after the horrible fire there.  


From the Windsor Castle Website:
Windsor Castle is one of three official residences of The Queen and has been home to the Sovereign for over 900 years. The Castle is the largest inhabited castle in the world and the oldest in continuous occupation. The imposing towers and battlements of the Castle loom large from every approach to the town, creating one of the world's most spectacular skylines. No other royal residence has played such an important role in the nation's history.


The Queen's standard was flying above the castle, which indicated she was there.  She was probably in town to watch some horse races; we saw lots of horse trailers in a field near the railroad.

I delighted in looking over a stone wall and noting that there were weeds even in the Queen's garden!  

The rooms inside the castle were all full of priceless art treasures, armor, and weapons. I cannot imagine living amid such splendor, or having to clean it all.  In one room, a guard looked at C's ""Houghton College Cow Tipping Team"" t-shirt and followed us along and asked about it.  I explained that his sister goes to college in a rural area, and the t-shirt is just a joke.  People really don't go out and tip cows over, (I hope).  Then I told him that when we were in the country, I saw a cow crossing sign, and nearby a sign that said, ""No Tipping.""  I took photos of both signs, and since they were in such close proximity, I figured that cow-tipping was forbidden.  My English friends and the guide told me that ""tipping"" means dumping rubbish, and that when one does dump rubbish, it is called ""fly tipping.""  Although I was glad to be enlightened, I was also sad, too, because I liked the thought of a prohibition on cow tipping!  Maybe I'll just have to find new pleasure in the injunction against fly tipping.  

C noticed this sign on the castle grounds:  Private Car Park  For Permanent Residents Only.  We giggled at the thought that the Queen's car could be parked there. In retrospect, since many who work at the castle also live in apartments there, it is probably a private car park for employees. The Queen's vehicle is probably in some protected place. Nevertheless, maybe the Queen's car could be parked there....

We also visited St. George's Chapel, which is on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  The Windsor Castle website says:
St George's Chapel is one of the most beautiful ecclesiastical buildings in England. The building was started in 1475 by Edward IV and took fifty years to construct. It is the Chapel of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, Britain's highest order of chivalry founded by Edward III in 1348. Members are selected by The Sovereign and include foreign monarchs and previous Prime Ministers. Ten monarchs are buried in the Chapel, including Edward IV, Henry VIII with his favourite wife Jane Seymour, Charles I, George V and Queen Mary and George VI. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother is also buried here, along with her younger daughter Princess Margaret. Beyond St George's Chapel is the entrance to the Albert Memorial Chapel, converted by Queen Victoria as a memorial to her husband Prince Albert who died in 1861.

We saw the tomb of the Queen's parents within the chapel.

We left the castle and went into the town for lunch at an Italian place.  Clifford told us that Italian and Indian cuisines are popular there.  The restaurant was just across the street from the castle wall, so we had an impressive view of the fortification with a clear blue sky behind it.  

The restaurants bathrooms were upstairs through a labyrinth of rooms. We gave each other instructions: Go up to the left, turn left again,  then  beyond the refrigerators with beverages in them, down the steps....

C and I had lasagna for lunch, and E had eggplant parmesan.

C found a Windsor Castle patch in the shops to add to his extensive collection. (This collection goes back to our days in Tennessee.)  

We went to three shops before I settled on a new set of placemats:  London Scenes. These have a blue border and are slightly larger than the green-bordered English country scene placemats I bought 20 years ago.

We wandered down the street and across the bridge to Eton. On the way we saw a small car turn a corner and stop; then a bus tried to turn the same corner and jostled the rear driver's side (passenger side on US car). The car driver was not happy; he leapt from his car, cursing, and ran to the bus and tried unsuccessfully to open the bus door.  We cleared out of there quickly. I didn't want to hear what the man was saying.  

Eton is a pleasant little town with shops, restaurants, and of course, Eton College. We saw some of the Eton boys in their everyday attire of striped pants, white shirt, tie, and jacket with tails. C was thankful he didn't have to get that dressed up to go to school.

Around 4 p.m. we stopped for tea and/or ice cream. We had to part and return to London.

We bought dinner at the Burger King, sans French fries (chips), because the electricity went out and the fryers weren't working. Kentucky Fried Chicken had to completely close.  We took our food to the room so C could eat and have time to change for the scout meeting at 7 p.m.

The troop that meets at the Baden-Powell house is five years old, fairly small, and has a high turnover.  Many of the members are ambassadors' children, so they are only in London for a couple of years before they return home.  They went to Hyde Park, or really, Kensington park, to thrown the soccer ball and frisbee.  It was a lovely, cool, clear evening. What a memory that is -- a Boy Scout meeting in Hyde Park, London!

Afterward, the troop came back to the B-P House to plan ""something,"" but C couldn't tell what it was. The Scoutmaser fussed at them for not making these plans.  I suspect scout troops are much the same all over the world:  a little irresponsible and disorganized!

I talked with a South African man who works with British scouts, or rather, he talked and talked and talked tome.  He covered all topics from Youth Protection to forbidden songs. ""Kum-bah-Ya"" and another song I never heard of are verboten for British Boy Scouts!  I wonder what is offensive about ""Kum-bah-Ya,"" other than that it hasn't much content. ""Someone's crying, Lord, Kum-bah-Ya.""  God is already aware of that!

This leader also told me that when C turns 18, he can come and volunteer for the British Scouts. He wouldn't be paid, but he'd get room, board, and a travel card. He'd work 4 days a week and have 3 off to travel or camp.  The term is for six months. I cannot imagine this happening, but it is an interesting opportunity to contemplate.

The desk clerk from America let me use his laptop for the internet, so I didn't have to part with my one-pound coin today.  This man was born in Chicago and raised in Tennessee. He joined the Air Force, was stationed in England, and married an Englishwoman.  Now he lives in Brighton and uses the train to get back and forth to work.

Tomorrow:  Home again."

"event","I'm taking a break from my Saturday morning cleaning to continue the travelogue:

Day Nine:  May 11, 2005

After a good night's sleep, my headache disappeared.  

Before breakfast I took pictures of E and C by the Baden-Powell statue outside and some B-P memorabilia inside. They wore their Class-A (khaki) shirts for me.

At breakfast we were joined by a new school group of handicapped students.

We took advantage of the after 9:30 a.m. travel card rates and then proceeded to the British Museum. We spent most of our time in the Egyptian and Assyrian rooms. I took lots of pictures of ancient cats!  C saw the Rosetta stone but was disappointed because it was behind glass. He couldn't touch it.  I suspect many people want to touch that stone. We couldn't find the cat statue V keeps talking about, though we searched the Egyptian rooms thoroughly.  The Assyrian friezes were incredible -- walls and walls of them.  In the ocean scenes on them we could find fish and crabs. C also found a war scene with a pile of heads -- gruesome! I saw the Elgin Marbles, which I wanted to see since I've read about them in history books for years and years. E joined a tour on the Ancient Near East while C and I explored the gift shop. I found a cat item, and C found a British Museum patch to add to his growing collection.  He also chose two books:  one on learning to read hieroglyphics, and a hieroglyph version of ""The Tale of Peter Rabbit.""  

This observation is purely a side note:  We noticed that many men in Britain do not trim their eyebrows and ear hair.  The man leading E's tour had eyebrows that stuck out like a shelf from his face.  Another man, who tried to get us to purchase an audioguide of the Elgin Marbes, had more hair in his ears than on his head.  C thought he had a hearing aid.  I guess extra eyebrow hair helps protect the eyes from falling debris -- and maybe extra hair in the ear canal helps protect the ear from insects or laterally-propelled detritus.  This isn't meant to be critical -- especially if you know or like men with lots of eyebrows and ear hair -- it is just an observation.

After we left the Museum, which in no way could we see in its entirety in a short visit or even a day, I looked in a souvenir shop for a London hoodie at V's request. I hope the one I found will be all right.

We at lunch at a pub, The Plough, and enjoyed it thoroughly:  grilled salmon, pesto mashed potatoes, and vegetables. We even ordered an appetizer of potato skins with bacon and cheese. The hearty lunch carried us through the afternoon.

Our trip to the Tower of London was enhanced by having to change tube lines -- up and down steps or escalators at least half a dozen times!  Would it have been faster to walk?  We were only one station away from the Tower!

This was C's off day. he had a headache and backache, yet he pushed  on for our sakes.

We arrived at the Tower in time for a tour. Our guide, a Beefeater,  was wonderful. He was funny and knew how to work the crowd.  He told us that prisoners who were about to be beheaded paid the executioner to encourage him to do his job with one stroke. ""This,"" he quipped, ""is called severance pay."" The crowd groaned.  

Even C perked up a bit during this man's tour.

Afterward, we wandered around the Tower. We saw ravens (I got a photo of C and a raven), the crown jewels, instruments of torture, and the armory.

We rode the tube to Gloucester Square. I spent my 20 minutes on the internet while the boys took our purchases back to the room.

Since we had a big lunch, we decided to purchase sandwiches, fruit, and sweets from Waitrose (grocery) and brought them back to the room to eat.

E and I went to the Victoria and Albert after dinner; it was open until 10 p.m.!  We came back in time to see a Churchill show on BBC 4, but it wasn't on. We must have mistaken the day or time.

The night manager of the B-P House gave us a dime that was found on the floor. That adds to C's hoard -- that, and the 1 p coin I found outside the ladies' room at the Tower.  Although I didn't take a photo of this sign,  it was  posted in the ladies' room there:  ""Loo of the Year"" for several years in a row.  Can you imagine?

Tomorrow:  Our last full day in the UK.  Windsor Castle, and meeting up with friends we hadn't seen in 20 years!"

I slept soundly at the B-P House despite the fact that I had only one pillow, no cat,  was on a lumpy mattress and had a busy street outside my window! The only thing that woke me was the wail of a siren.  Our windows faced east, and the sun peeped in through the curtains around 5 a.m.

The day was bright and sunny, and as the weather reporters said, it was a ""cracking good day!""

We ate breakfast in the B-P House.  The cooked meal consisted of the ubiquitous beans, tomatoes, poached eggs, bacon, sausage, and toast. We could also get a type of toast that looked fried; maybe it was French toast.  They also had hash browns and veggie sausage, which looked like hash browns in a tubular form  with peas and carrots thrown in.  They were pretty good.  The Irish school group was in the dining hall when we were there, and it was hard to find a place to sit. We decided to delay our breakfast on future days as the school group left part-way through our meal.

E purchased all-day saver fee tickets for us for the tube, which means we could travel anywhere inside zones 1 and 2 on the London map for 4.70 pounds all day. The only catch is that the tickets cannot be used before 9:30 a.m.

Our first stop was the Churchill Museum and War Cabinet Rooms near St. James's Park tube station. We were a little turned around in getting there, but we did arrive. The audio guides were an excellent help in understanding the museum, not that we could ever understand what life was like during WWII:  the deprivation, danger, tension, etc. The War Cabinet rooms were underground beneath a 6-ft. steel-reinforced concrete barrier. They are not far from Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament.

The Churchill section of the museum just opened 10 Feb. 2005.  It wwasn't ordered chronologically, which threw us off. It began with his WWII experience, then moved on to when he was defeated in re-election after the war. (He was re-elected Prime Minister later on.)  A video of his funeral came about half-way through, followed by displays on his birth and childhood.  Chartwell, his country home, came later on.  Perhaps the museum designers didn't want us to end our tour with Churchill's death, or maybe they wanted us to see the better-known part of his life first.  

We liked Churchill's quotes, which were displayed in many ways throughout the museum.  He was a master of the language. My favorite:  ""We are all worms. But I believe I am a glow-worm.""  

We ate a sandwich and had water in the museum snack shop, then finished our tour.

Our next goal was to go to Greenwich. Since it was clear, we decided to go by boat down the Thames. We were able to get a discount because we had tube tickets.  It ended up being a cold ride down -- and drizzly at the beginning, though it did clear. I took lots of pictures of places I recognized, and even some of places I didn't know.

My head began to hurt badly, and E, C, and I went to the ""saloon,"" an enclosed part of the boat. I ordered a hot chocolate (Cadbury -- with Cadbury sprinkles!) and took some motrin at 2 p.m.  (My headache only began to clear at 8 p.m. It was just one of those bad headache days.)

We landed in Greenwich and found our way to the TI and learned where to find the sights we wanted to see.  I longed to see the Prime Meridian, and of course got some photos there. I even have one of E and C standing next to each other -- in different hemispheres.  

We were in time for a free tour of the Royal Observatory. The guide was an excellent storyteller who knew how to spin her tale and leave us hanging on for the next installment. We were glad to be inside as it poured rain again.  

We also looked through the National Maritime Museum but kept the visit brief as I was not feeling well.  We returned to London by rail and tube. It was a quicker method, I think; at least it was warmer!

I went to the internet cafe, longing for an e-mail from V, but there was non.  Aunt J wrote and reported on my dad and Candy. She'd taken him over to visit the lonely feline three times.  Once when Aunt J went to pick him up, he was asleep on the sofa, and Candy was asleep on the chair next to him.  Cute.

We went to Burger King for dinner, then checked out the treats in Tesco. Before buying anything, we wandered in the arcade across the street. A Waitrose supermarket there had much of the same merchandise, and at a few pence less. We bought some ice cream for dessert and some Cadbury products for V -- or us!  : - )

The night clerk at the B-P House invited C to a Boy Scout meeting there Thursday night.

We enjoyed our ice cream in the room, and I took another round of motrin.  In retrospect, I think my headache was caused by too little sleep and too little food during the day.  

E and C played poker using the tea bags, coffee packet, shampoo packets, and shower cap packets for ""chips.""  C won at blackjack.

We watched BBC 2 -- educational TV.  The big show for the evening was ""The Monastery,"" a three-part series in which five men (who were definitely NOT monks)  ""join"" the monastic life for 40 days and 40 nights.   In the first episode, they were having quite a bit of trouble adjusting.  I doubt if any of them decided to become monks!  Maybe our PBS station will have this show in a few years.

I was glad that the electrical converter I took worked for both my digital camera battery recharger and cell phone recharger.

Now for the story of the gold.  C kept his eyes on the ground and managed to pick up 11 pence in coins during our stay.  Outside of the Churchill Museum, he picked up what he thought was a plastic earring. E looked at it and noticed it had an 18-kt. gold mark on it.  It was a gold screw-back earring with a jade flower and tiny diamond center.  Only C could find gold on the streets of London!

Before we left, I wondered if our trip would ""feel"" like long enough, but by this point, I felt ready to go home.  I was still happy to have two more days in London, but I did not regret leaving the UK to go home again."

"event","We all slept well in our quiet country abode and were well-rested in the morning. E, who had slept only four hours the previous night, slept eight full hours without waking up!  We began the day with a ""full English breakfast"" again and went back to the room until it was time to go to church.

I was wrong about the time church began, so we were early. We used the time to walk into the village to ""Arkwright's -- Open All Hours.""  It was a small shop just like the one on the TV show, ""Open All Hours,"" which is run by a man named Arkwright!  There we acquired a discarded cardboard box to protect our breakable items for the trip home.

I snapped pictures of the village as we walked to church.

We thought the church must have some substance to it as it had Sun. a.m. and p.m. services as well as a mid-week service and ladies' meeting. When we passed at mid-week, cars were in the lot, so we were encouraged.   Unfortunately, they did't make a good first impression, or maybe we didn't!  We were quickly told that only believers who had been baptized by immersion could partake of the Lord's Supper because ""that's the way it was with the New Testament church.""  They weren't quite clear in their explanation because they seemed to not want C and me to come in -- maybe for fear we would take the Lord's Supper. (E was raised in the Baptist church and was immersed, and they took his word for it, so he was okay.)  I asked if ""not fully participating in the worship"" meant we couldn't sing or listen to the Word, and at that point they explained what they meant.  So we stayed.  

The church is without a pastor now, and morning worship consisted of everyone sitting silently (we wondered if this was an ""inner light"" church).  Periodically, an elder or other man would stand up and pray a prayer that was just like a sermon and lead the singing of an unaccompanied gospel song. They didn't sing any psalms.  At the end they partook of the Lord's Supper, using a common cup, so I was just as glad not to participate!  A pastor came from Bristol to preach in the evening, and a man played an electric organ to accompany the songs.  After both services we were warmly greeted and talked for a long time. The people are genuine in their love for the Lord; they just have that different doctrine.

I was comforted by remembering that Christ let Judas partake of the Last Supper, and he knew what Judas was about to do.  Of course, Judas ate and drank judgment onto himself...

After church we made our way to a nearby village, Stanton Drew, and ate lunch at the Druids Arms pub -- how inappropriate for a Sunday meal!  Afterward, we looked at the megaliths in its back yard. We then proceeded to the stone circles of Stanton Drew, which were surprisingly impressive.  They aren't as big or as well-known as those at Stonehenge or Avebury, but they are significant. I liked the fact that sheep graze around these ancient rocks.  C even spied one lamb on top of a rock -- sort of like ""king of the hill!""

We had to cross a field to get to a small stone circle. As we went through the gate, a herd of Holsteins approached from our left.  We made it across the small barren field before the cows arrived but had to wait until the ""traffic"" cleared before we could go back!

We went back to the room for a nap before venturing out for diesel, a light meal, and evening worship. We ate at a ""Little Chef,"" which reminded us of a Denny's or Village Inn.  

After church, I took lots of photos of animals on the farm.  Sooty, the gray cat, was particularly friendly.

E and C watched fish jump in the lake.

E and C ended up taking cold showers because the water heater had been turned off.  The English are very energy-conscious, and I guess part of their conservation was turning off the heater. C said it felt like hail bouncing off of him!  E went to the house to ask for help, but there was no answer. (We found out why in the morning, but that is part of a different entry.)  Meanwhile, C figured out how to turn on the heater.  

We packed and got ready to depart for London on Monday morning.  The prospect of a transition to a new location left me a little nervous, as did the prospect of leaving on Friday.  Looking back, I can see how the Lord smoothed the way for us and watched over us in our travels."

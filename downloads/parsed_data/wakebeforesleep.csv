So, I flipped the button.  Next thing I know, we are all stareing at pee water flowing over the toliet and onto the floor.  Damn, that was so much water.
Matt didn't like this very much...He proceded to call me many names.  All included many words that start with F, S, and D.  After the name calling, he proceded to go into his living room, and kick a dent in the wall.  He calmed down, we had a laugh, and it's all history.

I wrote alot of stuff on guitar today.  Writing things is alot more fun when the purpose isn't to be played to people in a band.  I found that my stuff today was alot more personal.  I was acually satisfied with some of it.

I was hanging out with Matt today, and he needed to check his mail.  Since his home computer won't let him check his hotmail, we had to journey to the Murray Public Library!!!  Before we left the library (or biblioteca if your spanish), I was confronted by a fat man with glasses and a mustache.  Im guessing he owns it because he was wondering why I was outside talking on a cell phone.  He said something alone the lines of ""I don't people hanging around my building talking on phones, makes me think your dealing drugs, even though I know your not.""  It was one of the most akward moments I think I have ever had.  Oh yeah, he looks like some kind of rapist, so it made it a little more odd.

Im guessing its because I have too much time to think about everything.  im feeling really burnt out on life at the moment.  Things will change as I get older, but if these are the best days of my life, them I really don't want to see how the rest will be.  At the moment I am listening to Million by Jawbreaker, and for lack of anything better to put, this is what I relate to best.

Would that you could touch this angel in a clutch of snakes.
Oh pretty, pretty, I'm aflame.
So excited, so unslept.
Somewhat littered, so unswept.
You have to sleep before you wake.
I am spilled and poured.
I am peeled and cored.
I am hanging from the floor.
Flicker like a freak through a sleepless week
In a black cell of forever.
There's a point to this.
A point I think I often miss.
Oh clever, clever, where's your heart?
You can turn a phrase until it reads a million ways.
It makes no sense but it's as good as it is sad.
I am sad, elated.
I am segregated.
There's this stitching and it's itching.
All my friends are dead.
Asleep in distant beds.
At least these enemies stay close.
Take me to the pretty ones.
I want to be a pretty one.
Sign me to a nice girl so she can ruin me eternally.
They offered me a million bucks.
All I want's a steady fuck.
Oh steady, steady, where are you?
Channer surf a sea of static,
See the prize but you can't have it.
There's something thankless in a wish fulfilled.
I am thrilled and bored.
I am unskilled, adored.
All of both and none of one.
I would kill for more.
I haven't killed before.
I could set this heart on stun.
Take me to the pretty ones.
I want to be original.
Sign me to a nice girl so I can sing her something meaningful.
In my perfect world I'd be signed to a nice girl.
It would cost one million kisses."

"event","""I brush my teeth until they break, until I start bleeding.  So when I smile I'll know, I'm almost good enough for you.""
Seems like truer words have never been spoken, or sang at least.  That lyric pretty much sums up what I'm feeling right now.  Knowing you'll never be good enough for someone, but you still try anyways.  It's like a slow process of mentally killing yourself.  Pretty much all I can say to her is, I know i'll never be good enough, I could never compete with him, so i'll keep trying.  Sound confusing, it is.  I guess I can't get it through my head that ""no means no"" pretty much.  Oh well, another night of sadness and lonlieness, it's nothing new really.  I'll just be content with all the pain you've given me."

"event","Haven't updated this in about 2 weeks or so.  Im not really sure why I haven't, I guess I have been happy and depressed at the same time.  Sort of a split of things.  Ignorance is bliss, and when I just forget about everything, I guess thats when I'm happy.  Can't say I really like being in between the 2 though.  It leads to more confusion.  Im kind of tired of life always changing, the cycle of emotions.  I wish I could just end it on a happier day and be happy forever.  Of course this will never happen, reality hits hard sometimes.  Im not sure about much, I find myself regreting alot of the past few years of my life lately.  I've stopped thinking and worrying about death now, and just wonder when it will all turn around.  Im still really confused, and clarity is more of a goal now.  More recently though I just want to tell her how I feel, but there are too many things that could happen if I expressed my emotions.  She means alot to me, and she doesn't even know it.  Kind of odd how that has been.  I don't like to be selfish though, so im not one for ""stealing"" them.  Maybe hes better than I think, but still I can't be sure.  No signs of anything good or bad, so im in this state of nightmarish wonder.  And I know that all I just said makes sense to no one but me.  I guess its better to keep some things that way.  I just wish you knew."

"event","My Samiam cd finally came.  Very, very, very good listening.  Anyways, I haven't really done much today, went and looked at some halfstacks.  Getting one really soon.  I can't say that im happy or sad right now.  Just kind of here, blank emotions.  Im not in much of a mood for updating this.

"event","Wow, what an odd day it has been.  Very odd...  It has had some good moments and bad ones, just like every other day I guess.  Let's start out happy...Hung out with Alissa after school, made me forget about being lonesome.  Wrote some new songs and attempted to write some decent lyrics.  It seems I can't really express the pain im feeling.  Well, the rest of the day was pretty....shitty to say the least.  Boring assembly school, the usual shit im sick of.  My Samiam cd still hasn't came, im getting impatient.  Hmm, well, talking to Christina has helped me clear my head some.  Thanks buddy, I'd lose my mind without you.  I've thought alot today, and it seems like since I lost the guy who was my best friend some two years ago things haven't been as great as they once were.  He was one of the few people who truley understood me.  I wish things would go back to how they were, I just really miss those days.  If I hadn't had screwed everything up, I'd probley still be hanging out with him and be happy and carefree.  Oh well, I guess things will never to back to that.  No, im not gay or anything, I just really miss having a great friend there for me.  I have friends now, but it just isn't the same.  If you read this man, I want to apologize for messing everything up, and yes it was all my fault.

"event","Wow, I didn't ever think I would stick with updating this for so long, 2 days...YAY ME!  I guess im pretty hypocritical acually doing one of these, since I usually make fun of people who do them.  Oh well, another cure to bordem that will be forgotten in about a month or so.  Anywho, nothing new in the world of Andrew, just school.  Damn, I hate school.  Wow, acually in a decent mood though for no real reason, which has been very rare these days.  There is only one small part of my day that I enjoy.  I'll let you figure out that one though.  Most of my time is spent thinking about where all I went wrong, and how I wish I could go back and change alot of things.  Well, talking about my sad life has gotten me down again........

"event","Im really not sure why anyone would really read this, but I thought it would be a good way to get my head cleared.  Alot of shit has been going on right now, and it has all got me really messed up.  I guess having too much time to think about how many problems you have makes you relize you have them.  Im guessing one of my problems is dealing with changes in my life, like I always regret things and want to go back to the way it was, to get a second chance.  Guess that never happens though.  Right now I think that things were changing slow and normal, but then everything just sped up because of one specific moment.  I met this amazing girl, she is beautiful, funny, and just great to be around.  But since it's my life, there has to be a catch.  And of course, that is she has a boyfriend.  Seems like this kind of shit always happens to me.  Im pretty used to it, but its just odd this time for some reason.  I guess things will get better for me.  Thats not the only thing thats bothering me, im not an emo kid whos like killing himself over some chick who doesnt even know how he feels.  It just kind of brought everything out for me to see.  Oh well, im used to this life of rejection, nothing new to me to feel outcasted from the ""norm.""  Hmm, I guess thats all I have to say..."

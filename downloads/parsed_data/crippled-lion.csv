[Written...way before that. An old one.]

<b><u>Building Castles</u></b>

He plays with invisible building blocks,
creating castles in his head,
to keep his stolen jewels within,
and fill his halls with cherubim.
To dance a tune as yet unknown,
and sit upon his fading thrown,
and let his dwindling kingdom know
that they aren't ready, yet, to go.
And when the villagers depart,
the blocks, and he, so weak of heart...
What happens when the castle falls?
The jewels turn sand, the music palls,
and left is man in corner there,
so indiscreetly unaware,
with building blocks in hand and mind;
the ones that only dreams can bind."

<b><u>You Are Unreal</u></b>

My mind was filled with awe today,
I saw the glowing emerald leaves
that shelter you, all heralding,
and softly cover up your dreams.

You are unreal to me, you know,
and every time you look my way
I find it hard to mutter through
the juvenile games you play.

Your peek-a-boo with emerald leaves,
and branches that don't show your charm,
but liken you to devil's own,
and make the masses quite alarmed.

In time I pray of loving you,
without these thoughts of killing you,
and not because I'm needing you,
but just because I'm real to you.

But you, you are unreal to me,
and little more than I can see
is beckoning my wake and call,
I'll let you in, I'll take you all."

<b><u>most wickedly</u></b> or <b><u>herrulek</u></b>

wicked is as wicked does,
yet wicked is as wicked hopes to be.
you surround me, embrace me, encase me...
inside my head (where you can scarcely breathe
nor think to comfort me).
teeth of too-white fantasy
embrace your smile, tongue-in-cheek,

revealed in holeless riddles.
raven-haired monstrosity
which scarcely mirrors reality

turn you off as quickly as you turn me on,

embrace, encase, surround and show its face to me.

[Song written to coincide with an, as of yet, incomplete Archie fic.]

<u><b>Farewell or Fade Forever</b></u>

When we were young,
it never really seemed to matter what would be.
Endlessly, relentlessly, we bathed in sun.
And all those words
which were spoken hard and sharp...
did you know you broke my heart?
I just held on tight and waited for another one.
For another one.

<i>Farewell or fade forever
into your endless night.
I might miss you for awhile, but it's all right.
Is it goodbye or see you later?
How will I know if you survive?
Is this farewell or fade forever?
It's all right.
Oh, it's all right.</i>

The years have gone
way too fast for us to notice anything
that might have been a little tragic or forlorn.
And all those times
you were never on my side,
let's just pretend I never tried.
I just held on tight and waited for another one.
For another one...

And did you cry
when you said that you were leaving all those things
that didn't mean a single bit to you at all?
I bet you lied.
You're not as strong as you believe;
I'm getting harder to deceive.
Drop your lines, you know I just can't take another one.
Not another one.

<i>Farewell or fade forever
into your endless night.
I might miss you for awhile, but it's all right.
Is it goodbye or see you later?
How will I know if you survive?
Is this farewell or fade forever?
It's all right.
Oh, it's all right.</i>

(All right.)
You came to me, needed me, what was I to do with you?
Let you go; let you be; can't imagine life without you.
You made me see myself in such a different light...
and now it's down to this and no, I know it can't be right...
but if I have to let you go, believe me, you'd better know,
we will never be apart. You'll be in my heart.

<i>Farewell or fade forever

<b><u>touch</u></b>

your fingers yearn to touch me,
secrete romance and stick to my
body, climb and jump and crawl
while rain succumbs to healing heat
in this hidden, longing, lonely forest.

i used to watch you silently from
crevices inside your mind, the
places where you didn't want to be.
the places that you seemed to
leave for me.
i'd touch you from the inside,
wanting, needing, pleading
for the outside, but you never
noticed me.
then suddenly -- it seems as though
i've trickled to the floor in front
of you, and all the love i feel for you
is written on my face with glitter
clung to super glue.

this somehow captures you.

for now, your fingers idle here
among my thoughts of you,
they stick and slide and find
a heated wonderland of time
and hope and prayer and
baited breath which dreamt
of only you and now you're here.

the crevices inside your mind
remind you now that i had made
a home within the darkened
corners there -- you're well aware.

with tainted breath and words you
whisper momentary thoughts of
passion, ""you needed me...
you know i needed you.""

and silently i speak to you,
repeat the phrase in glitter
clung to super glue, my love
unending, recognized and
held so true --

but love, to
you, is chopped in little pieces
and dispensed when needed,
find the egg and crack it open,
blissful ignorance and pleasure
in a bit of candy.

i am candy; i am lonely; i will wait
until you understand.
i am honest; need you truly; i will
let you touch my wonderland.

four letters form my word for you,
for me you have but three --
for now, i let it be.

the super glue and glitter wait for me."

<b>Mind Games</b>

Calling me away from someplace I
Have never been, my mind wraps
Around my ugly fingers and
Reminds my heart of fading beauty.
""Let it be."" I stumble. ""Let it go.""
Everything old is new to me...eternally,
So that nothing comforts me.
Riots line my streets and curse me,
Angered proclamations claim me,
""You and you and all of you!
Make you dance, we're strong as you...
Or stronger!"" My mind betrays me,
New and ugly fingers laugh my name.
Does it comfort me this way?
Can the chaos mind games play?
Losing seems more old than new.
A simple string of distant beauty.
Reality calls gingerly, away, away,
Keep away from here, I beg of y--"

<b><u>Shallow Boy</u></b>

""It's hard to write a poem,"" says he,
""when I'm so shallow. I want
to speak in riddles of how beautiful
and wonderful you are;
I should tell you soon how much
I love you, top to bottom,
cover it in rhyme and pretty words
which taste like cherries on your tongue.""

You know he means it
when he says - or tries to say -
he loves you.
But he gets tongue-tied easily.
His words express a visionary
sense of density.

""It's hard to write a song,"" says he,
""when I'm so shallow. I want
to sing a melody full-drunk
in sensitivity you've given me;
I should tell you soon that I
can't sing, so you won't cry
when voices crack and crumble,
though they try to cry your name.""

It seems he means it
when he says - or tries to say -
you're different.
A million girls are good for
random pretty body parts
and broken halos which
he sucks like candy in the dark.

""You're an angel. Did I ever tell you
you're an angel? I should probably
tell you you're an angel.""

Is your halo broken yet?
Did you trip and fall on his
ego, on his pride or shallow
sense of love and lust?

You know he means it
when he says he loves you.

But she was pretty;
he was weak;
misplaced the words he meant to speak...
and love is lost on very shallow boys."

<b><u>on the art of sap</u></b>

I do not write
sappy love poems
for people I will
never really know.

This is not a sappy love poem,
and I will never really know you.

I will never really love you.

You stand in shallow light.
You stand and hold out
bleeding fingertips --
you dim away from sight.

You dim like shallow dreams.

Dreams of you in summer sun,
with whipped cream memories
and unconscious thoughts of me.
I stood in places you would never be --
you sucked my fingers in and
made them bleed.

You wrote me
sappy
love
poems.

You wrote me
sonnets,
each line
a piece of you,
but never
a piece of
me.

And so, these dreams,
these licorice and Mellow Yellow
memories of you,
fade into burning, churning paper
and words which wreak of
egocentric sympathy.

Did you ever really think of me?

Or was I a part of you so readily,
like hands or feet or lovely
blonde hair whipped by summer wind?

Will I believe these foolish stakes again?
My odds were never worth these
fingers, bleeding, numb and traveling
towards a stark reality of sap and ecstasy.

And so I sit and write myself a love poem,
and fill it with sap and drivel, believing
for a moment that I am truly loved --
by whom, I do not know.

If by myself, I don't know what I'll do.
I thought I needed you.

But I will never need
somebody who I never
really
knew.

And I will never need
somebody who resembles
memories
and
shallow
dreams
of you.

Death to the sap...discover what is true."

"event","[fanfic - WKRP] [2-13-05]

I feel like posting something other than poetry, today. This is a little shortfic that I wrote a long time ago, the first WKRP-related anything I actually finished. It is a brief piece regarding Herb Tarlek's daughter, Bunny.

<lj-cut text=""I Brake For Bunny"">

<hr color=""black"">

<u><b>I Brake For Bunny</b></u>

Bunny Tarlek was a dainty thing, her hair pulled about in pigtails with glasses nearly too big for her face; her mommy had told her once that the glasses would probably be permanent, but that if her daddy ever got up the money for her braces and her glasses chanced to break, she might just have to squint for awhile. As for Bunny, she didn't mind the glasses, and she wouldn't mind the braces...she was a cheerful child in many ways, and seldom let the world - or her correctional machinery - bother her.

The start of school had almost ruined this for her, as she came into constant teasing. Emmy and Roger were the worst. Roger was a general name-caller: four-eyes, donkey-lips, that sort of thing. As for Emmy, a year older than Bunny and a might bit bigger, she had declared one day that her father worked for Cincinnati's number-one radio station, WPIG, and that her father said that Bunny's father was an imbecile, and that he'd killed all kinds of turkeys and ducks and was apt to kill again.

Bunny had fought the accusations, knowing that they were true. Mommy, of course, hardly ever let Daddy down about those ""poor defenseless ducks,"" and as for the turkeys, all the local and a few national television stations had covered the atrocity - her daddy took up channel-changing at a rapid pace. Upon her questioning this he explained to her, ""If I want to look like an idiot in my own house I can do a good enough job of it myself.""

But still, she fought. After a week of school she came home and declared proudly to Mommy, ""I hit a PIG today!"" and her mother, confused a moment, murmured something about ducks, before realizing just what was going on, and she yelled, ""Herb, get in here! Your daughter is beating up your competitors!""

Bunny had received the standard talk about backing away from a bully, which her daddy seemed to mumble through in a confused sort of manner upon urging from mommy, and he finished as thus: ""And you just...you shouldn't hit people, Bunny, because they might hit you back or discredit your reputation. Do you understand?""

""Yes, Daddy."" She kissed him, and ran outside to play, leaving her parents to remain motionless and pondersome for some time. Finally they spoke to one another:

""Herb, for heaven's sake, is that the way you give a speech?""

""Well, I...what was I supposed to say? My son already plays with dolls, and now my daughter is beating up kids at school!""

""That's entirely beside the point."" She sat on the sofa beside her husband, adjusting his hair out of instinct. ""Bunny is very sensitive, Herb.""

""I know that.""

""I worry sometimes about what you say to the children when I'm gone!"" She sighed heavily, forgetting his hair. ""I mean, if this is how you handle bullies, then what on earth did you say to her about the frog?""

Bunny entered the living room to a silent Mommy and Daddy. She had only been outside for a moment, but already she was covered in a musty, dirty shell. She smiled. ""Herb the Third and me was playing. I won!"" And she ran off.

For a moment all was still; and then Herb Tarlek stood slowly, his wife Lucille following his lead. And he said: ""I'll...tend to Little Herb.""

""And I'll explain to Bunny that you don't know anything about handling bullies.""

Herb flinched at this, but within the moment, both parents were running, yelling their children's names, in a ritualistic fashion brought on by daily catastrophes. Bunny was found playing with Greenpeace II in her room, happy as a clam, and as for Herb the Third, he had been laying silently, carelessly in the dirt in the backyard until his father picked him up, handed him a doll which had landed several feet away, and brought him in for dinner.

As punishment, Bunny was not allowed dessert; she only ate that which Herb the Third couldn't finish, and Herb the Third hadn't been very hungry that night.

At least she'd learned her lesson.

-------------------------------------------

References:
(Turkeys Away) Herb helped Arthur Carlson throw live turkeys out of a helicopter one Thanksgiving as a promotional stunt.
(Real Families) In this episode we learn that Herb once ran a promotion in which he placed live ducks in a store window and made them dance with a hot plate. Also, we discover that Herb the Third is fond of dolls.
(Frog Story) Herb accidentally killed Bunny's pet frog, Greenpeace, by spray painting him pink. She has a new frog by the end of the episode.

<hr color=""black"">

I had considered a ""bring your kid to work day"" or some such scenario, because I find the idea of Bunny Tarlek interacting with the staff a bit delicious, but I wonder if this is just <i>too</i> obscure for anybody to care about. Still, because I am so unreasonably fond of Herb, his children seem to have slipped vaguely into the heart of the piece I am writing, so I'm satisfied.

<b><u>Valentine</u></b>

Hero-worship is reserved for
teenaged pin-up idols with their
dimples, prefect hair and muscled flesh.
You missed the age of

I love you not in breathless adoration.
Celebrity ... ""who on who"" and hissing
gossip slip beneath thoughts of
a good woman and children with their
sippy-cups and semi-famous father.
And thus you soon explode in cryptic laughter.
Subtle manchild brain cells take to dancing.
And you, encased in love past pin-up idol falsehoods,
Do not need my simple, raving valentine.
It's enough for me to watch you smile --
and know you'll never know."

[here was my original note: <i>This is what happens when I sit down to write something entirely random, see what develops, and then don't go back to edit it. This appears to have something to do with one of my favorite shows, Three's Company. Sort of. I'm in love with Larry Dallas. Hee.</i> // I believe I was also half asleep at the time I wrote this.]

<b><u>TV is Company</u></b>

Television shows echo memories of friends I've never had.
Jack and Janet used to say to me, ""We're all you have.""

(She's crazy, very much so, have you heard so, you've been told so.)

Movies always end too soon, the hero wins and pretty villains die.
But always with a twinkle in their eye. (They've killed a few.)
And something tells me tv, if it never ends, shall try to marry you.

(For I'm a bachelorette, and tv is as far as marriage gets.)

Behold! Undaunted by the light! Sleep here with me tonight!
Oh Larry with the bitter tongue and perfect curls,
With chest hair fine and lemons which impress the girls,
""It's real Corinthian leather."" (And vegans beg but needn't choose.)

Where movies have an ending, go on living someplace boring,
Television ends with nothing, leaves one hanging, lest we choose to never
See the elder versions of the characters who sleep with us at night.
But then again that's something of a fallacy, the sleeping isn't right.

I mean to say that sometimes I forget to feel perplexed by Somers'
Money issues; Chrissy, oh my dear, you precious thing, you died too soon.
Imagination cannot bring you back and that's too bad, because the tv set
Forgives and lets me guess at lovely things that you might do.

Jack Tripper died; thereafter, John, and thus I cried.

Imagination traps reality, or vice versa,
and I ramble hidden words which never mean a thing.

The light and empty bed are comforting."

<b><u>Pretty Good Odds (Snowball's Chance in Hell)</u></b>

Tryin' to remember what I forgot yesterday
But I can't think clear when heaven's this near
Tryin' to discover all the secrets you keep covered
But it's way too late, can't concentrate

Never had a snowball's chance in hell (no!)
Never really came across so well (no!)
Mm, you make me shiver, watch your body quiver
Turn me down again, turn around and then

<i>It's true, I needed you to help me see myself
I know you've gotta go real soon
And still I hope you will reconsider us together
We two have a snowball's chance in hell
But those are pretty good odds for me</i>

Never met a failure that I couldn't compensate
So just mark this down as another lost round
Settin' me on fire, day old booze and cheap desire
If you'd just give in, I could finally win

Tell me how in hell to make you mine
Baby you and me would work out fine
Mm, you m-m-make me shudder, I don't want no other
Lover on my arm, honey what's the harm?

<i>It's true, I needed you to help me see myself
I know you've gotta go real soon
And still I hope you will reconsider us together
We two have a snowball's chance in hell
But those are pretty good odds for me</i>

You, with your patent smile
Teasing me all the while
Dreams of fingers in your hair
Midnight madness takes me there
Nobody can discourage me
I'm gonna getcha anyway
Might as well just play along

<i>It's true, I need you to help me see myself

[Inspired by The Great Gatsby, with a good number of direct references.]

<b><u>Gatsby</u></b>

You know, Jay, it's been such a long time.
Was I your Daisy in some long forgotten dream?
Well I've been walking through my mind,
it's getting very hard to find what used to be.

Was I just your beautiful little fool?
Was there some make-believe you needed me to play?
Well all these lines are getting crossed,
I've come to find I've probably lost what used to be.

And if you spoke to me, I couldn't hear you.
Too busy loving you to ever risk getting near you.

<i>I've been everywhere, seen everything, done everything -- but you were never there.
Whisper in my ears and tell me that you always thought of me.
Can't you see, I'm too beautiful to care,
I just make believe you're always gonna be my great Gatsby.</i>

Did you grasp that dream that you held in me?
Well you never saw the light fading away.
Tried all those short-cuts in your mind,
finding nothing new and plenty old to say.

You know it makes me cry just to look at you.
We've lost the freshest, lost the best we ever had --
it seems our memories are clear
but I can't spend forever here, it's just too sad.

And if you looked at me, I couldn't see you.
Too busy loving you to really...know you at all...

<i>I've been everywhere, seen everything, done everything -- but you were never there.
Whisper in my ears and tell me that you always thought of me.
Can't you see, I'm too beautiful to care,
I just make believe you're always gonna be my great Gatsby.</i>

It seems that everything...must end in suffering...
I know you cared for me, and I for you.
But tragic sympathy...cannot keep you and me
together anymore...
It takes two to make an accident happen,
better get away fast, 'fore we realize it's you and I.

<i>I've been everywhere, seen everything, done everything -- but you were never there.
Whisper in my ears and tell me that you always thought of me.
Can't you see, I'm too beautiful to care,
I just make believe you're always gonna be my great Gatsby.</i>

My great Gatsby.
(How could you be...) my great Gatsby.
(Can't you see...) I just make believe...
(How could you be...) my great Gatsby.
(Can't you see...) I just make believe...

That you will always be...that you will always be...
You will always be...my great Gatsby."

<b><u>pester</u></b>

please don't ask me questions
which require me to think.
i'm very much afraid of such,
and presently am on the brink

of finding out exactly who
i maybe need to be.
your constant pester party
tends to try and stifle me,

for by asking me your questions,
and by telling me your plans
which will someday sanctify me
from my head's most dismal lands,

all the silent time i've taken
to erase my misery
is bled by your fixation
with the better part of me.

so please don't ask me questions
which require me to think,
for you see i'm much too fragile
to risk falling off the subtle brink

of finding out exactly who
i think i'm s'posed to be;
where at least i know for certain
that you cannot pester me."

[original note on fp: <i>I am Joy; Charlie is a fictional character of mine who lives in my head and probably lectures me without my knowing.</i>]

<b><u>Eraser</u></b>

Eraser dust is everywhere,
speckling empty everything,
gone to eye but not to mind,
my mind remembers everything.

Charlie calls me out from hiding,
""Joy has all the evidence,
life is meant for more than dying!""
Can't remember what it meant.

Dust to dust in cloudy poison,
I am more than pencil lead,
lost in tree compressed to paper,
words of wonder fading dead.
(Eraser dust is in my head.)

[Charlie Clark is my fictional character and muse of several years. I will try to present a character synopsis soon.]

<b><u>Melissa</u></b>
(or To My Love Across the Hall)
by Charles R. Clark

She sits in silence, for I look and see her
through the peep-holes in her mind.
She speaks a thousand words which fall
to earth and never make it to my ears.

She sits in silence, twirls her thumbs
in nervous segregation, wanting needing being
something that I never was and something
that I think I need or want or seek to be.

She doesn't know how much she gets to me.

Why don't the stars come dance for her?
Fill her bedroom with illumination made
to burn the brightest man, but gently
rock to sleep her sort of perfect angel?

The moon and sun that dance within
her eyes would feel at home and sparkle,
lead to laughter and rejoice in twilight,
take to dancing, lead her limbs about
in perfect splendor, flood my mind
with visions through the peep-holes
in my mind, invite me in and touch my
burning face; she doesn't know I've
dreamed her in this place!! She doesn't know...

She doesn't know how much she gets to me.

She sits in silence, smiles at me from her
hidden place where no one ever seeks to go.
I want to see this place, I want to know.
Her words are lost on simple minds like mine.

I think too much about her, wish and wonder --
as she walks and talks and thinks that she's alive.
But I know better, for I watch her as she
never moves, and never speaks, and never lives...

She never knows how much I get to her."

[inspiration: angus montier in the movie home fries, though you are probably best off not knowing that]

<b><u>on nepotism, necromania, and the hovering lobster</u></b>

disjointed,
you give me strings that i may move.
satisfy my cravings,
put me in the mood.
watch me dance disjointedly.
the name that you anointed me
has died too soon.

forgive me, mother,
dissect father.
(count the bullets in his brain.)
i love you, love you once upon a time.
you hold me softly, wasn't i just fine...?
(insane.)

<i>i am unique, i am the chosen one.
please don't speak, i'm not in need of one
word from you, thought you believed in me.
never true, you only needed me.
stick the stinger further down my throat,
and i guess that's all we wrote.</i>

enamored.
confused, don't cut the strings away.
i like the feel of you,
the memories we play.
can't you see how awkwardly
i count the steps you force on me?
(they end too soon.)

forgive me, brother,
unfit mother.
(faulty wires save the pain.)
i knew you, i knew me once upon a time...
i need held softly, make-believe is fine.

(fine one day --
the next day,
let's go insane.)

<i>you're not unique, you're not the chosen one.
listen, please, you're not the only one
speaking codes, no one believes in me.
love them more, nobody needing me.
place the poison deeper in my brain --
is this the way you make me sane?</i>

(count the raisins in my cereal,
all the steps i took to school,
all the times i needed you --
looking through, i'm losing you,
am i the only one you fooled?)

<i>foolish, foolish me -- i live insanity...</i>

<i>i am unique, i am the chosen one.
please don't speak, i'm not in need of one
word from you, thought you believed in me.
never true, you only needed me.
stick the stinger further down my throat,
and i guess that's all we wrote.</i>

last drop of blood, that's all that's written,
i'm forgiven, loved, forgiven,
mercy cries for me, does mercy cry for you?

please remember me, for i have died too soon."

<b><u>real</u></b>

fade away, now, nobody wants a broken toy
a plaything, no batteries nor puppet strings
bruised and bleeding
lost stuffing, button eyes that never see

<i>were you ever there for me
whoever you are?
i'm degraded, useless, wasted
were you me all along?

it's enough to drive me crazy
if my mind was more than fleece
if my feet were made for walking
maybe I would be, I would be...</i>

so i wake up in pain and insecurity
i cry out through painted lips, nobody hears me
empty mem'ries
no endings, only false realities

<i>were you ever there for me
whoever you are?
i'm degraded, useless, wasted
were you me all along?

it's enough to drive me crazy
if my mind was more than fleece
if my feet were made for walking
maybe I would be, I would be...</i>

real - like the air around me, filling empty lungs
real - like the time spent dreaming i could be someone
real - i'm alone inside a crowd of those alive
real though they may be, they're just as dead as me, inside...
just as make-believe

<i>were you ever there for me
whoever you are?
i'm degraded, useless, wasted
were you me all along?

it's enough to drive me crazy
if my mind was more than fleece
if my feet were made for walking
maybe I would be, I would be...</i>

real...maybe i could be real...
maybe i could be real...
maybe i could be"

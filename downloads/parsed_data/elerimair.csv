"event","<p>so i&nbsp;need to get something off my chest. this helps.&nbsp;today i've had porridge (with milk, instead of water today) as much as i hate milk, and thinking about it makes me wretch, porridge is what keeps me going throughout the day, i could last up until 7pm ish if i have a bowl of porridge in the morning. it definately keeps me from thinking about food in the day.<br /><br />i'm going out tonight and there will be alcohol involved, so i really need to be careful about how much i'm going to eat later.. error if i have nothing, (fear of getting too drunk). buuut i hate eating before i go out because i feel so much fatter, and obviously bloated. always a dilemma.<br /><br />having some tea at the moment..&nbsp; i know this is really public, and not usually my style, but feeling really low at the moment, and the only thing keeping me going is my control of food. also, have nothing to wear tonight which will make me look hot.&nbsp; think i'm going to stick to black, maybe some wedges to elongate the leg (or disasterously it could just emphasise that i'm just one big thigh.. ohhhh)</p><p>ok so perhaps i'm feeling better. keep drinking water and stay hot x x x x x</p>"

"event","<p>i just can not wait to get back to uni. no one criticising me for what i eat. today has been a down day, and i just feel like binging. but i know if i do that i'd feel even fatter. im stuck in this down stage at the moment, so i need&nbsp;some serious thinspo before i add more weight to my disgusting fat body.&nbsp;<br /><br />does anyone know of any ana books i could read?? like, good ones,&nbsp;'cause i like reading and it would be time consuming, instead of me having to think about food. xx</p>"

"event","i was in reading festival last weekend, and i thought it would be a golden oppurtunity for me to lose a few extra pounds away from home, thinking it would be perfect as i would be away from the prying eyes of mum and of course there is never enought ime to eat at festivals anyway. however, this wasnt the case at all. instead, my ""fat friends"" subconsciously urged me into buying loads of alcohol, which i kinda accepted anyway and pot noodles and just general sick addetived up food like that. (which i strongly am against in the anyway, which leads me into question why did i ever let myself go there in the first place?? it makes me so angry and doubt myself) i feel like a failure. all my good efforts have been cancelled over one&nbsp;binged weekend!!!!!"

"event","hello, this summer has been hell on my weight. when im away in uni, it is soo much easier to fast, and just generally get on with it without any complications. i love that feeling. here though, mum is watching my every move, and literally forcing me to eat the food she cooks, and then i feel guilty so i do (my aim isnt to hurt my mum at all) but being so close to her is wrecking my weight, i feel like im gaining weight everyday, and all the plans i make in advance seem to get ruined. i need help!! sorry for boring you guys but i need serious thinspo before i get fatter! this sounds truly awful and arrogant of me, but as much as i love my mum, i know i want this more! (but im just too nice to reject the food she gives me) help!!"

"event","<p>Hi everyone! (Im new) My name is Eleri, Im Welsh (thats right, people from where Im from are very small minded, obviously Im not one to judge everyone under the same brush, but you&nbsp;do&nbsp;tend to come accross people who wont understand eds, as we, as a country are greedy, hungry people. I think thats quite a good description... Sorry if I have offended anyone).<br />&nbsp; Just wanted to say that for a while nopw I've been ana, maybe only admitted it to myself this year, and it took me&nbsp;a while to actually join a communtiy that supports it, not saying that I dont agree to theses sites, cause I actually rely on them. (Thankyou for all your support)&nbsp; But I just wanted to make a statement that I am fed up of having to dumb myself down to family, friends, work mates etc.. of convincing them, and making everyone believe that I am actually eating. I am sick of it (literally). WHY should we have to pretend to be hungry and make the same old tired excuses all the time to our loved ones for the sake of convenience??! to keep them happy?? Sorry, but live for yourself, and if that means&nbsp;doing your own thing and fasting and saying no to your mums homecooked dinner and causing friction(in my case), then do it! Be true to yourself, and if you dont want to eat and keep to your special number of the day (as you planned to do), then fuck the fatties! DO IT!&nbsp;<br /><br />Love xxxx</p>"

"event","<font face=verdana color=black><b> So I've come to realize that I pretty much seem to always write in here when I'm either sad or really pissed and tonight its a mixture of both. I don't really feel like explaining the situation cuz its private for many people but all I've got to say about it is that boys suck. They may not mean to, but face it boys... its not a coincidence that you always break our hearts. We too may do the same to you, but to us, you guys are a race of fucking idiots with very very rare cases of good ones. I'm sorry I have great guy friends but as soon as its something more, psshh you guys are pussies. I give up, I'm sorry I'm pissed off and well you guys all know how I get when one of my girls gets hurt. Maybe I'm a little fed up of getting hurt as well. I can't take it anymore, I really can't.. I just can't."

"event","<font face=verdana color=black><b> Tonight I realized something that made me feel really down. Its just that suddenly I'm not the one thats hurting anymore. I mean my issues are far from being over, but I am somehow over them or have moved on as much as I think I can right now. Yet, while I'm feeling all of this, too many of my friends seem to be going through hell right now and It seems that I've lived my life so concentrated on how to get over my own problems that I have no clue what to do when it comes to helping others get over theres. I used to think I was a pro at this stuff, I mean I've lived three-quarters of what most people talk to me about anyways, yet its just not the same. I feel so terrible and honestly I feel selfish. Its so hard to want to be there for everyone but not knowing how. All of this some how coincides with the fact that I can't seem to trust anyone, so why should people trust me? Its just that I simply cant help the way I am. I've tried to open up and I've tried to talk about things as much as possible, but I just can't help the fact that im scared shitless to do it. Whats even worse is that most people don't know why they act this way, while I know exactly why i am. You see I used to think it was just because I was sensitive. You know, I'd cry all the time. But I didnt even realize I had reason every single time I shed a tear. It seems a little part of me knew that my father wasnt sleeping on the couch for the hell of it. It seems a little part of me knew that they didnt just split up because things simply werent working out. It seems a little part of me knew my dad had invited a new person in our family without us even knowing yet. Maybe a little part of me also knew that I'd end up with the stepmom from hell as well. I probably already knew I took things for granted before I found out we were moving out of my hometown and away from all my friends, my home, my... safety, because from that moment in my life I've been trying to replace that safety. The difference is instead of a warm protective hug, I have a state of the art security system installed lol. So my analysis ends with a simple word of advice. There are things in your life that will change and form you, but don't even think of trying to do that yourself. It wont even work cuz you see i've tried and tried and tried and the only thing that I learned from it was that I should just fuck it."

"event","<font face=verdana color=black><b>I dunno how much more of this I can take... my mother is being a total crackhead. Last night I asked her if I could go see Christian considering we are moving and I won't see him in a while and she was all freaked about me going out too late and that I'd get myself raped or something! wtf! Since when has my mother been worried about me at all? Today I asked her if I could go see Brittany and she said she was sick of me leaving all the time. Man oh man, I dunno but shes sooo stressed out and its making me soo stressed out as well. She thinks shes got the weight of the world on her fuckin shoulders when I'm the one thats been going through hell for the past 4 years. Oh so shes moving in with her boyfriend of 6 months in the middle of fucking nowhere and I'm supposed to be cool and have no life just because she now does. I've always gone with the plan and never got a say in anything thats happened. I'm graduating, moving away from my friends *once again*, going off to college which scares the shit outta me, and trying to deal with the fact that my mother is moving me in with some guy we barely know and his two kids which we barely know. SORRY for wanting to have my friends around for a time like this. Its so typical of my parents not to understand what the hell I've been going through considering their parents have both been together for like 60 fucking years. I just wish I could be 6 years old again... playing in the dirt with little boys who have cooties"

"event","<font face=verdana color=black><b>Man you gotta love dashboard.. they are so my life right now lol. I just love them hehe. Tonight I got to go visit my slut, Christian, which I missed a hell of a lot lately! He's been all busy with his band and stuff which is great. I'm really glad that he's got something going for him. He's like a big brother haha. Now that I'm moving and he's moving I'm probably not gunna get to see him very much so he might stop by tomorrow night and hang out. He's getting his own appartment downtown which is gunna be totally cool cuz he can take me drinking and then I have somewhere to crash woohoo. haha. Well on a different note, I'm getting a little worried about the move honestly. I dunno if I'm gunna like it there, I mean its so far from everyone. I know I have great friends who are gunna come see me anyways but I mean it just complicates everything and now I'm gunna be living with people I hardly know, which is a little hard. I'm definately one to take things as they come though so I guess we'll just have to see. I got a text message from mr.matt tonight which was goodstuff considering I didn't think that would ever happen lol. Jamie's gunna love hearing about that haha. I'm just so -pleased- with the people in my life. Couldn't ask for better friends and thats the truth."

I NEVER know what the hell to get my dad and all we do is go visit my grandmother and play cards with her or something lol. Gotta love grandma, but I'd rather be doing other things. I guess what really gets to me is that today reminds me of my grandpa who died two years ago and it just gets kinda hard to see my dad missing his dad.. I was the biggest baby at the funeral, thats what I remember most. Yeah, I had to be a tough girl and agree to read a poem at the ceremony, which didnt go down too well.. I just really miss him a lot and I wish I could tell him how much he is missed. It sucks... god I can't wait till this day is over. Besides that umm I'm never going back to Jackeez cuz all I do is meet huuge players there and like I really need any more of those. Ricki umm is another story, my god i am not even gunna go there. cough* knee pads *cough cough*. haha I guess the thought of thursday night cheers me up a bit but yah its still a crappy day..."

"event","<font face=verdana color=black><b>so for some reason I hear a lot of gossip and I wasn't too pleased to hear something this morning. A certain friend of mine cheated on his girlfriend and obviously she has no clue cuz he's too much of a little pussy to say it. So right now, I'm feeling really bad for her cuz shes going to find out after everyone else, which is really hurtful, i know. Secondly, this guy is my friend and I really thought he was better than that. Yeah, this doesnt involve me at all, but he's still such a fuckin idiot. It makes me wanna run up and tell her, lol cuz i guess thats what i wished had happened for me. Its so gay when they get away with it too. My god, lol... anyways so thats fucking stupid and he needs to be kicked in the balls lol. All guys who cheat for that matter."

Considering this is more a random blog of thoughts, I figured maybe this time I could write a little more often. Please notice the mouse which I use to indicate my mood lol. He is soo cute. Im kinda assuming its a he, i dunno. Anyways.. today I had two french exams which were incredibly easy. They are just so pointless and I'm getting reeeally fed up. I just wanna graduate! Prom is going to be soo kick ass. We are gunna be lookin so hot lol and whore face might not go so thats a plus for everyone. You know, I was the first to realize how big of a bitch she was and get sick and tired of the way she was treating me and now I got to watch her loose each and every one of her friends one at a time. Its been great and although I kinda feel bad for her, I try not to think about it because I know she doesnt deserve that. You can't expect to treat your friends that way and never have it come back to slap you in the face. For all the unnecessary drama that we've gone through cuz of her, I can't help but to love what shes going through right now. Besides that, we are getting ready to move and I'm not sure how I'm feeling about it yet... hopefully thats a good thing, cuz i would know if i felt sad about it i guess. I'm pretty sure I'll find out when the time comes. p.s. you guys can comment on this crap by clicking below haha please dont hesistate"

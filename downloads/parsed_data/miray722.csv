Uhm.&nbsp; Semester ended okay.&nbsp; Did pretty well in all my classes, and even passed P Chem!&nbsp; (With a whopping D, but you know what?&nbsp; I FUCKING PASSED P CHEM, which is more than some people can say.)

Summer's been going well.&nbsp; Visited Washington with Aaron, which was fun.&nbsp; Washington is beautiful - but too cold.

As of right now, I've been living in Blacksburg for the summer.&nbsp; Pissing a lot of friends off back home, and family, buuuut I'm happier down here and thats what counts.&nbsp; Aaron and I moved in together and so far it's been wonderful ^^&nbsp; He's a little messy, and it's lonely while he's at work, but other than that it's all good :D

I am happy right now.&nbsp; Haven't been this happy in a long time.

I will try to do better about updating, perhaps..."

Kim, Phillip, and I then went out to Bush Hill Elementary to attempt to play softball (we were rather bad at it, but it was very funny, and we actually did manage to hit a few balls), and then came back to my house to play Sorry on the porch because it was so nice out. We then got milkshakes, and played Uno, and then while Kim and Timmy were being outside being dramatic, Phillip and I played Go Fish. Yeah. Go Fish. I'm not joking. The four of us then played another game of Sorry while waiting for Victor, and then when he said he was too tired to come over, we showed Kim Repo! The Genetic Opera, and she was somewhat hooked. So all in all, that was a good day. 

I very much want to go to a theme park. I'm in the mood for rollar coasters. Today is perfect. It's not too hot, but nice and windy. A bit on the cool side, but when you're walking around in the sun, chilly is good. It means you're not willing to wait for an hour just to get on a water ride.

Matt(1:18:39 AM): yesh?
Caida722 (1:18:45 AM): whyd you break up with me?

Matt(1:23:49 AM): yeah


That pissed me off a bit last night. He never gives me straight answers. Even when I ask direct questions, he either dances around a real answer, or does that and avoids answering completely. It's very annoying. I went along with it, but I was kind of annoyed for the rest of the night. The most I remember of why he broke up with me was that 'he was sometimes unhappy, and didn't feel that I respected him.' I kinda feel that needs clarification. I don't know, maybe I'm alone in thinking that.

Whatever. I'ts a gorgeous day, so I'm going to take another bath :) and get ready to be out in it."

Mind you, I didn't choose these guys, we were assigned. They both e-mailed and said 'yeah, sure, we can meet after class.' Guess what? Neither of them showed up. And then on&nbsp;Saturday, we did the homework, finally, and they both revealed they never go to class. Some surprise that. We finish the homework. On Monday, the homework is turned in.<br /><br />Except on&nbsp;Wednesday, my group member comes in and says 'the homework was due today, wasn't it?' No, fucktard. the homework was fucking due <em>Monday. </em>So, our professor said he'd give us 50%. The answers were right.&nbsp; We could've had 100%. But no, we go a 50% because the fucking group member that said he would turn it in didn't show up to class.<br /><br />And this is partly my fault, because I should have known better than to trust an almost stranger with my grade. I should've had my own copy and turned it in just be sure. But I'm kind of dumb like that.<br /><br />And then lab ran over an hour, because our dumb professor gave us a lab that was too damn long to actually due in the alotted six hours we have for the day days of lab. Instead, very few people finished, and I only finished because I stayed an extra hour to do it, because I had nothing else to do.<br /><br />Nothing else to do except for the English midterm. That was long, tedious,and &nbsp;mindnumbingly boring. And I stayed up until 4 am to do it - although admitted, part of that <em>was</em> my fault, but I wasn't really complaining much about how late I stayed up. I then got up this morning at 8:30 because I tried to get the bathroom before&nbsp;Lisa, because we both use&nbsp;it at more or elss the same time on Thursdays.&nbsp; Therefore, I got to campus a good 45 mintues early, which was cool because it allowed me to find a&nbsp;parking spot much easier&nbsp;than I normally can. Except then I had to wat around for a good 40 minutes for class to start. Whatever, no biggie. Until some stranger&nbsp;comes in, asks: &quot;Is this Bob&nbsp;Canter's class?&quot; and when we say 'yes'&nbsp;he says 'it was cancelled.'<br /><br />Cancelled!&nbsp;I go up at fuckign&nbsp;8:30 am, stayed up until 4 fucking up, for no fucking reason other than to show up to a class for it to be fucking&nbsp;<em>cancelled</em> with no notice. People are like 'at least it was cancelled!' I don't care! if I'm going to go through all that effort of dragging myself out of bed, shower, and getting on campus early, then &nbsp;I damn well better have what I got up for! Even if it <em>is</em> an extraordinarily dull class.<br /><br />...Needless to say, I kinda hate anything school related at the moment, and have reassured myself that you <em>really</em> can't rely on anyone but yourself.<br /><br />On the bright hand, I played Left 4 Dead to calm myself down. And there is something very therapeutic about playing a zombie, tackling someone, and just sitting there ripping them to shreds while his teammates leave them there to die :D&nbsp; I think my laughter was actually rather maniacal. Oh well.<br /><br />Now, I could be a good girl, and do homework in the rest of this free day. Will I? Nah."

"event","<p><br />OMG, two posts in one day.<br /><br />I heard something today that made me laugh a little. I was half-napping in my Critical Reading class (after two A's back on quizzes...haven't seen grades that high all year) - when the girl behind me was talking about how much work she had to. I found out the girl she was talking <em>to </em>was a double major, and the conversation went something like this:<br /><br />Girl 1: I can't wait to get out of this class. I have one more class today and then I get to start my four day weekend.<br />Girl 2: Oh, man, lucky. I'd like one of those.<br />Girl 1: Yeah, but I do have a <em>lot</em> of work to do. So if that makes you feel any better...<br />Girl 2: Yeah, a little bit. I have some work to do, but don't want to stay up too late because I have to get up at 8 am for my two morning Comm classes.<br />Girl 1: Oh, that sucks. What are you majoring in?<br />Girl 2: English and Communications.<br />Girl 1: Oh, wow, you're a double major. Good luck with that. (I feel the need to mention that the Comm and English majors overlap a lot in their credits so it's extremely easy to get them both done in a decent aount of time.) I'm just an&nbsp;English major, I don't even have a minor. ~laughs~<br /><br />And then she went on to talk about how everyone says English is an easy major when it's not, and compared it to engineers. And I just wanted to laugh. I like English (clearly, since I'm double majoring in it). I have respect for English majors. But I will never be convinced that&nbsp;English is anymore than a mediumly difficult major, at most. The liberal arts are different from the sciences because if you <em>like</em> something in the liberal arts, it's easy enough to do well (except maybe Art. I love art, but I know I'm not particularly good at it). The sciences - well, even if you like it, you're lucky to be seeing B's. <br /><br />I feel like this makes me sound a little condensending towards English majors. And I can't lie, I think I am a little bit. If that's what you like, go for it, but I just can't believe it's particularly difficult. Might be a lot of work (Lord knows I'm not looking forward to any of the 10 page papers I'm going to have to write), but <em>hard? </em>No. Particularly not if it's by itself.<br /><br />Who knows, maybe I'll change my mind when I fail some English class in the future :D</p>"

"event","<br />So, I woke up with a slight hangover and to listening to people have sex. Admitted, they were being quiet and so I'm not very annoyed with <em>them, </em>but I think it's fair to say it's an irritating situation and did not lead to a good start of Valentine's Day. After finally managing to drag myself out of bed, Matt asks me to lunch. I, of course, get my hopes up (thankfully not as much as I may have once had - I didn't even cry today! I guess I'm learning). In the process of getting ready to go meet him, I developed a sore throat. That quickly progressed from an ache to OMGKNIFEDEATHOW. Yeah, it sucked. And then lunch with him was fun&nbsp;- sans sore throat - and he was really sweet. For instance, he said he wasn't really hungry but he just wanted to spend some time with me. How do you stay mad and distant from someone like that? &gt;.&lt;<br /><br />Anyway, the rest of the day was kind of blah. My throat got worse and I didn't really do much.<br /><br />Oh, and Audrey and Cat showed me Repo man: The Genetic Opera last night, and now I'm vaguely obsessed with about half the soundtrack. Some pretty awesome music there, and one of the first reasons to respect Paris Hilton (she does a great job in that movie). Only disappointment was the song with Shilo and her dad fighting about allowing Mag to stay wasn't on the song - which I find odd, because it was one of the better ones and a decent length. Ah well.<br /><br />Anyhoo. A big THANK YOU to Kristen, Phillip, and Ben (even though only Kristen reads this...lol) for making my Valentine's Day not a completely disaster. It could very well have been plain boring without you.<br /><br />Despite their help, I felt a bit lonely for a decent bit of it. I feel like I'm losing two of my best friends, and all we're doing is pretending that things are fine. I'm not sure how to stop it. v.v<br /><br />PS: I got a 53% on my first Organic exam, but the class average was a 64%, so I don't <em>really</em> feel horrible about this Still, kinda sucky start of the semester's grades."

So gross, but what can you do?<br /><br />But, I'm procrastinating because I feel like it, and decided to talk in here for a little while. First off classes started today, though I only had one today. My full schedule is looking crazy and like this:<br /><br />Monday:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00-8:50 am: Foundations of Physics I<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:05-9:55 am: Principles of Organic Chemistry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:05-11:00 am: Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:20-1:10 pm: Foundations of Physics I Recitation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1:25-2:15 pm: Introduction to English Studies (pending)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2:30-5:30 pm: Organic Syn-Tech Lab<br /><br />Tuesday:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00 am-9:50 pm: Foundations of Physics I Lab<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:00-12:15 pm: Introduction to Critical Reading<br /><br />Wednesday:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00-8:50 am: Foundations of Physics I<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:05-9:55 am: Principles of Organic Chemistry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:05-11:00 am: Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2:30-5:30 pm: Organic Syn-Tech Lab<br /><br />Thursday:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:00-1:15 pm: Introduction to Critical Reading<br /><br />Friday:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:00-8:50 am: Foundations of Physics I<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:05-9:55 am: Principles of Organic Chemistry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:05-11:00 am: Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />So, on the bright side, my week gets less and less busy as it goes on. On the not bright side, Mondays are <em>murder</em>. And I have to get from Shanks to ChemP in 15 min, which - while not impossible - is going to royally. Suck. Big time. Particularly when carrying books for three classes.<br /><br />My mood lately has been whack. I've ranged from okay to downright depressed, hysterical, and hopeless. Sadly, I haven't hit happy at any point, but what can you do. I'm using mom's car because mine didn't get out of the shop in time, but the drive down here wasn't bad, even with an unhappy kitty meowing the whole way. Yes, I brought Estella down finally. She seems perfectly fine here, happy even. She was kind of confused at first, but it seems I didn't need to worry quite as much about her as I used to.<br /><br />I'm slipping back in to 'missing Matt mode' (unintentional alliteration), and trying hard to not flip out at him. Valentine's Day is going to suck. I'm sort of trying to cover up the hurt and bitterness with full-blown irritating instead. On the bright side, it's on a Saturday, so I can get wasted to my hearts content.<br /><br />I think i'm done rambling now. I really should get to bed at a decent hour, because I'm going to hate myself when my alarm goes off tomorrow morning."

Yeah, and my insurance just went up about a month or two ago from the accident I got in to last year (that one <em>was</em> my fault, unlike this one). So...needless to say, dad isn't too happy with me at the moment.<br /><br />Anyhoo, Exam 4 in&nbsp;Analytical was also pretty bad. It was very heavy on High Performance Liquid Chromatography, which we never even talked about in class. The quiz and practice exam he gave us was not helpful at all, and we never even had homework on HPLC. Needless to say, I was pretty pissed when I took it, and so is everyone else. Here's to hoping he decided to curve.<br /><br />On the brighter side, I think my O Chem quiz went rather well (relatively speaking, since my grades in that class are on the verge of failure) so here's to hoping I pull at least a C on the final exam and therefore the class. I don't know what I'll do if I don't pull a C in the class. Who knew I'd be so awful at O Chem when I loved it in high school?<br /><br />Anyhoo, Left 4 Dead and Dead Space are both amazing games. I've been playing them with Victor (or watching, in Dead Space's case) and have been enjoying them immensely. And kind of got addicted to Left 4 Dead. Ah well. Matt came over last night for a little a bit, and just chilled, and all in all last night made up for the awful week I had.<br /><br />I cleaned my room today (finally, it was looking like a tornado had hit it) and organized all my notebooks so when I go to study I can find things easier. Final exams coming up. Eeep. But really, I was decently productive today. ^^"

I felt completely unwanted - as if nothing I did was right, there was no future for me, and the world would be better off without me in it. I was literally drowning in unhappiness and uncertainty, and didn't feel like I could stand another day.<br /><br />I look back at that time now, and I'm grateful Mom came in and found me that night. I don't know if my overdose would have worked - but I think it would have. I'd never felt quite that way before, as thought my heart had stopped. I don't really remember what the doctors said, but it doesn't really matter, I guess.<br /><br />I still often feel unwanted and unhappy. I still feel now the way I did then. But the difference is, I don't want to end my life over it. I don't know when that changed or why. I still backslide sometimes. I've cut - recently - and tried to drown myself in alcohol or pills. But never once did I want to try and take my life again. The thought has crossed my mind, I suppose, but then I realize only a moment later that it's <em>not</em> what I want. I want to hang in there and keep trying. Even after Matt pretty much ripped my heart out, I wanted to keep hanging in there.</p><p>I, uhm....don't know where I was going with this entry.

I guess I just realized there are people who would miss me - and opportunities I could have that I'd miss out on. I suppose curiosity for the future overrode the terror and certainty that I'll have a horrible future.<br /><br />I'm shushing now, because I don't think this entry made much sense.

Too many vivid dreams, a lot of them decently upsetting so that I wake up. Sadly enough, they're about Matt not wanting me or failing my lab reports or classes.<br /><br />Which is, not surprisingly, exactly whats been plaguing my mind for ages. I got a 56% on my O Chem exam, knocking me down to a second class with a D as my grade. I even tried. I really tried. I just couldn't get it all straight.<br /><br />Now I'm doing a lab report on Biochem. Biochem. I'm not a fucking Biochem major. I don't know what the hell a Michaelis Constant is or turnover number. I've been trying to understand it since Friday, but this is apparently something I can't teach myself. I went to my TA and she didn't do a very good job at explaining it either - and I don't blame her. She hasn't done Biochem in years, she said, and we're not doing this in class. We're doing chromatography in class. Dr. Morris is out of town, so it's not like I can go ask my real professor who assigned us the god damn lab, and our TA cancelled recitation today, so there's another potential source that went out the window. I'm completely lost, and this is a formal report, meaning it's worth double the amount of all our other labs. And i have no idea what it's on! I can manipulate the numbers and get answers, but I don't know what that <em>means</em> in terms of significance.<br /><br />And then, of course, there's Matt. Who I am <em>so</em>&nbsp;fucking tired of missing him. I'm tired of hurting and I want to <em>stop</em>. But you can't just turn emotions on and off. I'm trying. I've been trying. There's like an ache in my chest that just won't go away. And he doesn't want me. I know he doesn't want me. You'd think I'd be able to come to terms with that and get over it. Ten months of pure utter bliss - out the drain! Bye bye! Doesn't seem to matter. He, apparently, can just stop loving someone when he wants to. Makes me feel like maybe he never loved me at all.</p><p>And it sucks, because when I'm <em>with </em>him, it doesn't matter all that much. I'm not really all that upset. I could be flipping out all day and then if I see him, it's not so bad. I feel a little bit better. Ironic, really, since generally he's what made me upset in the first place. Maybe classes.</p>I'm just so tired of trying, and then fall flat on my face anyway. I keep on trying anyway, hoping one day I'll get it right, but I just keep hurting in the meantime...</lj-cut><p><br />On a more amusing note, if not happier, do you think it would be detrimental to my grade sending Dr. Morris a big 'FUCK YOU' for assigning us this lab report?<br />&nbsp;</p>"

Furthermore, they messed up the process of the payment for my battery/power cord order (Have I mentioned this is about the tenth power cord I've had to order in two years? Dell's adapters ALSO suck ass), and to top it all off, I can't find the order for my battery itself at all. Then they say the delivary date is going to be a month now. I'm sorry, how fucking long doe it take to ship a battery and power cord?)</p><p>I was in a good mood. WAS.

I am on the verge of failing math. Again. Why do I fail everything I try? It's like my specialty or something.

I have a D in math (barely a D), a C in O Chem, and I'm hanging on to a B in Analytical by teeth and nails (I'm probably going to lose it by the end of this exam). I really wanted a 3.0 GPA this semester, but alas, I think it's going to go down to a&nbsp;2.5 or something...&nbsp;"

It was crowded and noisy &ndash; obvious people were doing their last-minute shopping before the holidays.&nbsp;Kids ran around in excitement, screaming about god-knew-what with their mothers chasing after them frantically, trying to get them in order. Couples wandered around holding hands and giggling to each other, and the entire place was cheerful despite the chaos.</font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew Johnson was not immune to the happiness, but he really did want to get out and get back to his apartment. He still had a lot of work to do tonight, and hadn&rsquo;t eaten for most of the day, so he would like to get some food in him soon. All the same, he stood patiently in front of the display of flowers, trying to pick out which he thought his girlfriend Anne would like best and ignoring his basket that was beginning to get a little heavy. </font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thought of Anne and her curly blond hair and infectious laugh brought a smile to his face. They&rsquo;d been dating for two years, as of tomorrow; to celebrate their two-year anniversary, he was out buying a bouquet of flowers and planned to take her out to a fancy restaurant&nbsp;that everyone had been raving about and she&rsquo;d been dying to try. He was hoping they could go back to his place afterwards and spend some alone time, so he&rsquo;d kindly asked his roommate to find somewhere else to be tomorrow night. His roommate had laughed and agreed, telling Andrew to have a great time. </font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed everything was falling in place and despite his hurry to get home, he couldn&rsquo;t wipe the grin off his face. Anne made him incredibly happy and he loved every opportunity he had to let her know how he felt. In return, she made all sorts of arrangements with her crazy schedule to make time to see him as often as she could. She was sweet and thoughtful, with a thousand jokes and a smile she reserved just for him.&nbsp;He honestly thought he could spend the rest of his life with her, but&hellip;well&hellip;two years seemed a little soon to be considering marriage when they were only twenty-four. He&rsquo;d give it more time before thinking further on that train of thought.</font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tearing his mind away from his girl &ndash; sort of, anyway &ndash; he went back to studying the flowers. He remembered her saying she loved roses, so he picked a healthy bouquet of striped roses that were a deep red. He smelled them once and smiled a bit, liking the strong scent they were giving off. He hoped she would like them.</font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walking away from the display and towards the registers, he reached in his pocket for his wallet. The lines were still ridiculously long, even the express ones, so he picked a random one closest to the display and began to wait. He absently looked at the cheap magazine covers, headlining everything from political debates to rumors on bad plastic surgery, and of course the gossip on the celebrities. He never took these seriously, but they were at least amusing to look at while he was waiting. And judging by the woman in front of him who had a <i>ridiculous </i>amount of things on the conveyor, he felt this could take a while. Did she really need to buy that much, honestly?</font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His thoughts wandered for about ten minutes while he waited, and finally the woman was halfway checked out when his phone in his pocket buzzed. Juggling his basket of groceries and the roses, he picked up and smiled at the name. Anne.</font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey, babe.&rdquo;</font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hi, Andrew.&rdquo;</font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing.

I met a guy at work, Jake, and I really like him. He asked me out yesterday, and I want to go.

The person behind him must have caught something of the conversation, because they sent him a vaguely sympathetic look and then looked away as if they were crossing a line. </font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew realized he was in public. He set his basket down out of the way and put his phone away, slowly as if he were in a trance &ndash; everything seemed dreamlike, but &lsquo;dream&rsquo; implied something positive, or at least not horrific. This was beyond a nightmare, one that he wished he&rsquo;d wake up from, screaming and sweating perhaps, but knowing it wasn&rsquo;t real. But it was.</font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at the red roses in his hand, realizing suddenly that he no longer needed them. Tears threatened to fall as it slowly began to sink in, and he felt that an icy hand was gripping his lungs and he wasn&rsquo;t able to breathe; it caused a physical pain that spread through his chest, and up his throat. He suddenly felt a desperate need to get out, get to at least his car, because there were too many people here &ndash; he couldn&rsquo;t break down yet. He didn&rsquo;t want to go back to the flower display, so he hastily shoved the flowers in the magazine rack and rushed out. He didn&rsquo;t feel himself moving, but knew he must have, because he soon found himself in his car, tires screeching as he sped his way out of the parking lot, narrowly missing a few pedestrians and other cars.</font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mind wasn&rsquo;t coming to grips with it. He hadn&rsquo;t awoken this morning expecting his life to come crashing down like this. He hadn&rsquo;t seen any signs &ndash; maybe they&rsquo;d seen each other a little less, but that was to be expected with their busy schedules. He didn&rsquo;t understand why it had to happen like this. How could a three-minute conversation cause this much pain?</font></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tried calling her back when he reached his apartment.

I know very few honestly 'colorblind' people. And it's worse, because this country encourages racism, however roundabout a way it might be. Towards white people, where I come, from but I'm not stupid enough to say that racism towards all other races have vanished. It hasn't. I happened to grow up in an area where it was prejudeced against <em>me</em>, because I'm white. Thank God I'm female, or I really would have been screwed. But I know people who grew up in places where it sucked because they <em>weren't </em>white. How is that fair? (This rant spurred mostly because my roommate said Obama won't win because he's black and this country is racist. I just walked away, because I DIDN'T want to talk about it.)</p>Another reason I hate politics is because people are so close-minded. You can't change their opinion. On anyway. Half the time they vote for the party instead of the candidate, even if half the party's policies are against something they believe in.<br /><br />Alright, I'm just getting myself pissed off. You see why I don't follow politics? I'm telling you, bloody homicide.<br /><br />This entry makes me sounds like I'm in an awful mood.

I managed to finish my lab report and prelab early (for once, and all thanks to Amy who wanted to work at 1:30 today, when I normally would have been nursing a cup of coffee). It's pretty refreshing, even though I know I should be working on the shitton of Calc and Anal Chem homework I have. I don't wanna think about it, though.<br /><br />I've just been really tired the past couple days. I've been sleeping enough, but I've still been downright exhausted. Calc today was a nice change because I actually understood the hell he was doing. Unfortunately, I'm crap at visualizing the graphs (which, actually, is my same problem in Organic Chem. Who woulda thought someone who's relatively artistically inclined could be crap at visualizing things?) which makes the whole thing a bit more difficult when doing it on my own.<br /><br />Today Amy and I had a lengthy discussion about how neither of us really know why we're doing Chem majors. I don't really like it all that much, but I like everything else even less. So I kinda just crunch numbers, work my ass off, and try to make myself fully interested when I'm only partway interested. Lovely, no?<br /><br /><u>Random Note of the Day:</u><em> </em>Did you know that a dragon and a unicorn are the resonance contributors of a rhinoceros?

There are a lot of tall, modern buildings, roads that are actually intact, and somewhat pretty vegetation throughout that make the place fairly decent. And despite the slightly harsh winters, the summers are incredible weather, with pretty much no humidity to speak of.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just that unfortunately in my job, you don&rsquo;t always remember these charming details of Vito. Working at night and making a living through murder begins to force you into your own personal hell, and the outside world of pleasant Vito is just a teenage memory. You could probably blame that on me, I suppose. I don&rsquo;t make much of an effort to remind myself of Vito&rsquo;s nicer side, and none of my colleagues really do either. It&rsquo;s a personal preference, I guess, to stay in our own world.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I work in the Night Watch. Twelfth squad, to be specific, and I vary between second and third in command. My squad is technically one of the two &lsquo;special operations&rsquo; squad, but really we&rsquo;re mostly just like the other ten squads. We deal with the supernatural of the city &ndash; vampires, werewolves, umbri, invisi, and the like. They attack someone, and we answer the call and do damage control. Or sometimes cause the damage at time, though we really try not to. We also go after clans and raid their territory to try and clean out as many as possible. In our free time, we work diligently on developing cures, or at least suppressants, for the genes that turn humans into these creatures. We haven&rsquo;t been successful, yet, but some of the discoveries we&rsquo;ve made have been immensely helpful in battle. For instance, who knew it&rsquo;s not just werewolves that are allergic to silver?</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mostly my team is called in for battle, though. We&rsquo;re smart enough to work in the labs, but given my team&rsquo;s skill, we&rsquo;re generally thrown out in the streets instead. Generally we find the most dangerous mission of the night. Yeah, it sounds like a bit of a killjoy, but I kind of like it that way. I enjoy living on the edge. It makes every day mean something extra, every friend I make &ndash; however few and far between they are &ndash; a little more special. I guess you could say it&rsquo;s given me a slightly different outlook on life, though that certainly wasn&rsquo;t my intention when joining. Funny how life works out that way; it&rsquo;s always full of surprises.</span></p></lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Sad Ramblings""><br />I asked mom to get me an appointment with my psychologist when I go home this weekend.<br /><br />And now I possibly feel like the silliest person alive. Except not. Everyone makes fun of the people who can't get over their ex, who want to talk to professionals about it, until they're in that position. I couldn't understand Kim when Jeremy broke up with her and she tried to kill herself. I tried to support her, be there for her in whatever way I could, but I didn't <em>understand.</em> It didn't make sense to me how someone felt their life was over just because their significant other broke up with them.<br /><br />Well now I'm in that position. Perhaps not so dramatic. I don't necessarily feel like my life is over. I even know that - one day - I'll probably be happy again. But right now? It's really <em>really</em> hard to believe that. My friends tell me I need to 'just get over it.' I'm trying, I REALLY am trying. But it's not so easy. I would if I could, because that would make my life SO much easier. I'd like my heart and brain to stop arguing. To stop warring between pessimism and optimism. Why don't emotions listen to you?<br /><br />Kristen pegged it today. I think it hurts more because Matt seems to be doing so much better with it all, which makes me sometimes feel like he doesn't love me, and maybe didn't love me. Not as much as I did him anyway. And she said it. 'He had a choice.' He chose to break it, and so hes doing better. I guess I'm a little self-absorbed. I don't think how it might hurt him; maybe I just don't know because he doesn't show me. Or maybe he really is okay. I'm not sure.<br /><br />But, yeah. I partially feel kind of silly wanting to see my psychologist about this, and partially think maybe I'm actually being responsible to try and get real help to get over it. I don't really know, but I'm gonna go ahead and do it anyway.<br /><br />Now I just need to think what to tell her.</lj-cut><br />By the way, What Hurts the Most by Rascal Flatts is an AWFUL song to listen to when you're dealing with a breakup. Sad, since it's so damn pretty.<br /><br />To quote Xander, from Buffy: &quot;I'll go home, and listen to country - the music of pain.&quot;"

"event","So, Thursday afternoon I started crying merely because Matt didn't want to have dinner with me. This sounds pretty pathetic - is pretty pathetic - but it does kind of hurt knowing he'd rather eat dinner with someone he lives with than me, when he only sees me maybe three times a week. Then I think, well of course he probably doesn't want to see me, because I am his crazy ex-girlfriend that is prone to bursting into tears and asking him why the hell he thought it was necessary to break up with me.

I wonder if this would hurt less if he would stop telling me he still loves me. Because when he says he loves me, I still have hope. And having hope crushed continuously&nbsp;is actually more hurtful than having your heart broken and then given time to move on with life. Instead, I'm left wondering 'he says he loves me, so maybe one day...' and I keep hoping for that 'one day' but I know it will never come.

And then he says something stupid like 'Never say never' and then I want to hope again. So then I wonder if I should tell him to stop telling me that, except that because of that stupid thing called 'hope,' I never get the balls to tell him.

Its been two months and four days since I rejoined the single community of the world, and the pain hasn't dulled a bit. I would have thought it had, but I still can't get over him. It sucks.

I don't know who I'd like to lash out at. I'd like to alsh out at him, but I don't think it's his fault. I don't really know if I what I did justifies this pain I'm in, though. I know I fucked up - repeatedly - but this seems a bit harsh.

And then I take my happy pills. Despite the utterly godawful fucking migraine it's giving my (my seratonin is like 'WTF? Why are we getting bumpd around so much?!) I do feel better. Or at least more numb. Kinda sucks I have to take this little pink pill just to make myself feel not so crushingly hopeless and just more 'meh.'"

"event","Listen to the tales of the ""peaceful"" protesters, who the police beat with no reason, except for disrupting traffic, destruction of private property, destruction of public property, distributing the peace, resisting arrest and assaulting police officers.

If i hear of motherfuckers doing shit like the here, i'll have to grab the HCYM get some brass, and baseball bats and beat the shit out of you rioting motherfuckers. When you protesters use violence as a means of ""stopping"" or trying to stop I should say you use the very thing you say is wrong. If you can use violence for you cause who are you to say the government can't do the same, especially if the government is representing ""the people"" if they involve violence. Do you really need someone to point out the difference? Resisting arrest neither falls in peaceful protesting or violent. It's self defense, something which everyone is entitled to. I am not obligated to allow them to detain me. I never signed a waiver or a contract saying I would. My individual rights which i wrote up for me say that I can resist any fucker trying to restrain me. I did not elect them. I did not propose the laws they try to enforce. I did not pass those laws. I have nothing to do with them yet I somehow obligated to follow them by my own will? NO! Argue it was democracy that did this shit. Go ahead. It falls upon deaf ears.
I am not  part of this de-mockercy as much as you aren't. Don't jade yourself. You're not even shit in this system.
There is a difference in violence. The first is the motive. Is the violence being inflicted being used to oppress and force people to submit, or is it in the form of resistance objecting to something viewed as unjust? Forefathers of this country have even spoken about revolution, even violent uprisings if the people feel the government has gone a stray from the intended set-up it was meant for. Maybe you're comfortable giving up the little liberties and freedoms you are allowed as is but I and millions of others are not! We are entitled to oppose and tyranny with ANY means necessary. Whether it be education, peaceful, direct, or just all out civil war. Your argument is lost because you cannot tell the difference between actions. Your childish mind cannot tell apart, so you just see it as ambiguous violence. Maybe it's what we have all along suspected. You're a fucking moron. I'll fight you and your gimps in the streets anytime. Don't demean our direct tactics when you make claims to bring violence against us. At least our has further meaning than ""ME NO LIKE THIS, ME CRUSH!"""

"event","I suppose I compensate for hardly ever posting here by posting long messages. *Laughs* That reminds me of when I was assigned Moby Dick in my senior year of high school. My teacher, the illustrious Mr. Peery, told us to take a copy of the novel from a great stack that he piled in a corner of his room. To our surprise, the book looked quite small, no larger than any modern pleasure-reading novel. When I commented as to the fact, he said, ""Yes, they printed it with very small font. But don't worry: he compensates by using very large words.""

Anyway, on to my ""journal."" School goes well, I suppose. Not a 4.0 excellence that I expected, but well enough. My philosophy class, (Ethics & Education), is superb. I have learned a great deal from it in a semester I expected to learn very little. My understanding of CS Lewis, Aristotle, Plato, Kant and Bentham is much improved. Due to it being an ethics class, I suppose, I have been spending an inordinant amount of time on such concepts as ""ordo amoris"" or ""proper love.""

We, as human beings, are only healthy when we feel appropriately to situations. Not that one emotion is the only appropriate for any given situation, but many are, and many are not. As I look back upon the strong emotions of my life, I think perhaps that I did not feel ordo amoris as I should have. Some people have deserved better from me, and some things as well.

I posted a brief note in Angelica's journal today, the value of which I am not sure. Perhaps I will only cause her more pain, knowing that I read her journal. I do not wish to deprive her of that outlet, and if she tells me not to read it, I will not. My ethics on this, at least, are firm.

*Sighs* I wish life was less complicated at times, but then I remember how much I love the complexity, the ordered chaos of a world populated with beings that are both ""animal and rational,"" prey to their natural urges and the demands of a society so many thousands of years in the making. Life is a wondrous thing, in all its dramatic sorrow and triumph.

The little things catch my attention these days. Small things, like the cursor on a monitor, or a bird on the stone wall that winds through Butte college. I wonder if I'm not getting enough sleep? I have trouble finding words sometimes, not often, but enough to frustrate me. I wonder if I'm not reading enough? My eyes wander, and so do my thoughts, drifting to all sorts of unrelated things. Hell, I wonder if I'm not living enough?

Bryan came to my house the other day, looking for Betsy. She was at work, at Country Crest, but luckily I was on the phone with her during her break. I gave the phone to him, and the use of my porch. (My brother was on the 'net in the main room, else I would have invited him in.) I left him to his privacy, but I could still hear his pain, through the intervening wall. He and Betsy talked, of what I know only a little, and shall not say, for around 15 minutes. I am certain they would have talked longer, but she was on a ten, and had already taken 25 or so. Neither Bryan or I wished her trouble at work.

I hope that he heals. Many who read my journal probably already know his current grief, but for those that do not know that he is in sorrow and pain, and would likely still appreciate your undifferentiated support, nonetheless. I have heard many opinions on his situation, and will not voice any of my own to add to the multitudinous cry. I hope that he heals. I hope that we all heal, that catharsis exists for all men who feel pain. (I use ""men"" in the true neutral.)"

"event","It's been a long time since my last post. I've internally debated a few times the usefulness or emotionally helpfulness of livejournal, but I'll give it another, (probably shortlived), shot.

As some of you know, I'm going to Butte Community College this semester, planning to transfer to a four-year eventually. (Perhaps Davis, perhaps not.) I'm only taking 12 units this semester, (I wanted to leave time for work), but it's not much of a concern. Even before enrolling this semester, my first true college classes, I had 27 units on the books. 24 of them are from various AP exams and classes, to my great joy and relief. The other three came when I submitted my photography portfolio to one of the fine arts instructors on campus before the summer started. He reviewed and graded it over the summer, and gave me three units of ""B"". (3.0 GPA and I'd never been to a day of class. *Laughs*)

I mentioned work in the prior paragraph. I'm working out at Butte now, as well. I'm a ""computer tutor"". I describe the job as being a nurse for computer labs on campus. Basically, I stay in a campus lab, (One of three: Main Drop-in Lab, Language Lab, or Basic Skills Lab), for several hours, fixing problems, helping people, and just monitoring so nobody visits porn sites or chatrooms or prints more than ten pages at a go. *Laughs* It's pretty boring, but its easy and it lends free time on a fast network connection. Pays minimum, but its supposed to go up in a month. Who knows how much, I'm not exactly union.

On a seperate note, my classes are awfully odd for both myself and my major. I'm a Physics major, and I'm taking no sciences this semester, and a basic unrequired math. (Statistics) I'm trying to keep my skills up, reading Physics dissertations and books and practicing basic calculus in my stat class. (Try integrating the normal curve sometime. Ugh.) I'm reading a book right now called ""The Elegant Universe."" It is actually putting up a fight to ""A Brief History of Time"" as my favorite Physics book. And that was Hawking! I reccomend both if you haven't read either. In case you are worried, although they are rewarding for those with some mathmatical training, they are easily conceptually understood by lay-men, and are a rousing read. ""The Elegant Universe"" helped me to finally visualize the contradiction between Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation and Einstein's Special theory of Relativity, (Not the E=m(c*c) one that's so famous.), that led to his famous General theory. The book's supposed to lead into string theory and M-theory, which is why I checked it out, but the journey there is certainly improving my grasp of Einsteinian Physics.

My schedule has been pretty hard on me, going to the campus five days a week, two of which I have to wake up by 5:30 for. Not a pleasant experience, and I wouldn't reccommend it. I'm going to try not to take any 8:00 classes next semester, though I probably won't be so lucky.

I'm actually writing this in one of the labs where I'm working. It is taking me a while, because I can only type for a minute or two at a time, then I have to go help someone or just ""make my rounds."" I really wish it was 18:00 already, and I was at home. For such a seemingly easy job, dealing with this many frustrated people and this many obstinate networked, buggy computers is pretty tiring. I haven't even got my first paycheck yet, because they pay monthly! *Sighs* Well, I'll write again soon. I always appreciate comments or emails from my friends. I wish I was on messenger more often, but it's not allowed in the computer labs, and the person running the lab should be setting a good example."

"event","Yeah, so it's been a while since I've actually written in this thing. A lot has happened, but I suppose I'll only talk about a bit of it here. I know a lot of people reveal their deep and dark souls here, but I've always been something of a private person. (Or so I'm told.) So I'll just chat about the usual stuff.

Actually, I just got done writing a graduation speech. My school wanted me to write one, it's a quarter of a symposium speech I'm doing with a couple of classmates. (I'll post it as a comment if anyone would like to read it.) I graduate the sixth, for those of you who don't know. 

I'm looking forward to college, if not to getting a job. I'll like having an income, I suppose, but I know a lot of it won't actually be spendable, and I detest manual labor. (Considering the only thing on my resume will be a high school diploma and a little bit of tutoring for the school district, that's about what I'm limited to.)

School's been pretty hectic, and between classes, projects, Judo, and Magic, my life has been nonexistant. I had a Judo tournament last Monday, (Not yesterday), and I think my leg might have a fracture in it now. (I have an appointment to check it out in a few days.) It's not that bad actually, unless the specific spot hits something, or I put pressure on it in just a certain way. Then, it feels like its going to explode. Most of the time, I can avoid it. Magic, (The card game), is starting to become a mild obsession. I go the tournaments every Saturday, and have a lot of fun. I've always loved strategy, and its an incredibly complex game. Eh. Just one more aspect to my all-encompassing geekiness, I suppose. ""If I'm going to be a nun, I'm going to be the god damn head nun!!!""

Some of my friends have been going through a lot of drama, but I guess I'm not so much entertainment for the journal-cruising type. Since my rather ugly break-up with Angelica, I've played it fairly mellow. I guess I'm just tired, tired to the core from this all-too draining year.

Life continues. So does everything else.

"event","I'm sure than anyone and everyone who actually reads my very infrequent posts knows that I broke up with Angelica. Perhaps some of you hate me, perhaps some of you believe that what I did was rash, uncaring, or just stupid. I'm sorry.

I broke up with Angelica because I could no longer be someone who I am not. Angelica and I have always been very different people. If you don't believe me, you haven't met us. For months, I have altered who I am to make things work. I am a romantic. But in my mind, true romance isn't blind love. Romance is seeing the beauty in things, and enjoying what you see, both physically and metaphysically.

I can no longer bury myself beneath the weight of depression and despair. Although I am incredibly saddened by all of the pain my actions have caused already, I will not take them back. I have made a decision, a decision that was not sudden or hasty, but was the eventual creation of months of slow hammer-taps, and a week of deep introspection.

Angelica may hate my actions if not me, but I belive that she will recover. If the relationship caused me so much pain and self-hatred, then I cannot believe that it could be truly healthy for her either. With time, she will heal and so will I.

I am somewhat offended by her accusation or implication of my infidelity. Anyone who knows me knows my ethical code. Hell, I violated personal policy by breaking up with her on the phone simply because I couldn't handle the ethical consequences of not telling her the moment I decided. If I had waited, for compassion or convinience, I would have been lying by omission. I may have been a bastard, but better to be a bastard because of honesty then be a liar because of guilt.

I am sorry to anyone who hates me or condemns me for what I did. You have the right to, I won't deny you that. Angelica can hate me too, I can't stop her. Maybe hating me will force her to reevaluate our relationship like I did. Maybe it will help her heal too.

"event","I sacrificed my lunch and beginning of fifth period today to attend a perfomence in the gym. A Malcom X impersonator from LA had been paid to come up here and give his show: A condensed, fast-paced one-man act of the life of the controversial civil rights leader. The perfomence was astounding. I doubt I've ever seen quite so emphatic and powerful a speaker. He had no problems, no spills, and no lapse at all in a script that was 200 pages long and took him nine months to memorize.

I learned several things, though I already knew a fair bit about Malcom X. Many people attended, though not nearly as many as my Sensai, Garibaldi, hoped for. (He was the coordinator of the event, as he is both the advisor for Link Crew and the BSU. He's also my Bojuka-ryu sensai.) Unfortunately, not enough people in this area have had much exposure to history outside of a textbook. It was amazing.

***

Speaking of my Sensai, my testing for my green belt in Bojuka-ryu is tomorrow. (For those who don't know, Bojuka-Ryu is a martial art discipline that mixes the styles of Judo, Karate and Western Kickboxing.) I'm worried- I don't think I'm prepared. Even if I pass, and I hope to, I am nearly certain that there will be those of us who are tested and fail. I always feel terrible when I succeed and others do not.

***

On another note, Angelica finally made it to school today, after missing six and a half school days IN A ROW. She had a nice eight day weekend. *Laughs* She's ridiculously behind, but at least she can begin to catch up now that she's actually HERE. I was getting very, very worried about her. She gets into periods of depression on occasion, and there is very little anyone can do, even myself, to drag her out of them.

I tried a new method of ""dragging"" last night, and it seems to have worked. Pretty much, I screamed at her. I hated it, and I really felt like I was crossing the line, but I can't stand to see her hurt herself, and maybe sometimes a person has to do whatever it takes to help someone else. *Sighs* At least she seems happy today.

This is getting very multi-sectional. Our Mock Trial final was Wednesday evening. We lost the trial by a narrow margin, but the team to go to state was decided by the overall score of all trials. We came out ahead because we won the first two preliminary competitions. So, if funding is adequete, we're going to State again!

This year it's in Riverside, (California), and it's one very long drive from here in Norcal. It should be fun though, if it's anything like last year's San Jose. I'm going to miss Mock Trial in college. They do have a similar program, but considering that I'm not going into Law, or even a law-related field, I'm not much of a candidate.

"event","Well, today is Friday. Wednesday was our first two Mock Trial competitions, preliminaries for the county finals to see which team, (Pleasant Valley High or Las Plumas High), chooses the teams to compete in the final. (Highschools provide both a Prosecution AND a Defense team, but the final is a one-trial event, so only one team from each school will compete in it.)

We won, by a good margin, but have yet to receive the individual score sheets that will tell all of us exactly how we did, as singular members. I'm dearly hoping I scored well, and maintained my reputation from last year's perfect scores.

Today is also Valentine's Day, of course. Cooincidentally, my eight-month with Angelica is today as well. (My friend Shawn thought me lucky: I got to completely cut out one romantic holiday.) I gave her an ""Italian Charm Bracelet."" It's tiles have raised hearts on them, unlike the usual glossy-flat surface. In addition, I got two charms for it to start a possible collection: A heart with an arrow through it, to symbolize both our love and the receiving of it on Valentine's Day, and one that has a few piano keys on it, because she loves music, and piano especially, so much. She was ecstatic, and I'm very glad I chose to get it. It was a little expensive, but I thought she would like it. (Talk about worry, though-> She'd never actually mentioned she wanted one, so I was going on my knowledge of her and her characteristic likes.)

She gave me one of those huge Hershey Kisses. Chocolate is always a safe buy for me, and I didn't expect anything at all from her. I thought her broke, and although I lament the expense, it was nice to get something. (I rarely get a Valentine's day present, and I'm one of the most diehard romantics I know who has the Y chromosome.) She's been very affectionate all day, and I'm very glad she's in a good mood. (She was late to school today, so I was nervous.)

On a different but still romantic note, Angela came to pick up LeAnn at break today. They are spending the weekend together. LeAnn was all dressed up, wore make-up, had her hair done. It was easy to tell she'd be seeing Angela later. *Laughs* I know how she feels. She was cheerful to the point of bubbly in first period, and glanced at the clock every 30 seconds. Despite their often time, LeAnn's happiness has a direct relationship to the time she spends with her girlfriend. It always makes me happy when they can be together.

Sadly, not all romance is flourishing. My dear friend Lace was somewhat rebuffed this morning. Her love interest, Nathan, fairly ignored her and seemed, (To my eyes), to pay more attention to his ex-girlfriend Shyla. Perhaps he still hasn't gotten over her, but even with her, during their relationship, he wasn't especially open. His shell just hasn't been cracked by much of anyone yet. I retain hope for them.

Despite the fact that she is almost undoubtably one of those girls they show in ""Girls Gone Wild"" early in the morning, she is still quite the bitch. A 27 day-long period.

Unfortunately, this year, I did not get overall high score. Missed it by a point. I know that doesn't sound very contextual to most of you, so let me put it into perspective. I had 7635 total points! If I would have answered any single question right that I answered wrong, rehearsed my speech one more time, maybe winked again at the old lady who heard my interview, I would have won! If I'd have known that a <i>matate</i> was a Native American food, rather than some sort of longhouse, I'd have won. *Sighs* Ok, so our school needed another 2800 points. But personally, I'd have felt a ton better simply winning personally.

Enough with ranting. Mock Trial's gone into harcore mode. My life is officially devoted to it for the next week. I'd apologize to Angelica, but so is hers. I have a tremendous amount of work, as I am both prosecution attorney and defense pretrial attorney. (Translation: I have to know 12 legal cases better than I know my mother, and argue them like I'm Hitler or Hilary, depending on the need, in addition to knowing the complete persona and character of three different fictional people better than the people who play them know them. And one of those people is played by a different person in every school.)

Classes are easy, thank the gods. (Sheesh, listen to me, the agnostic.) Yesterday I got three tests back for three different classes. All top scores. *Smiles* I'm not arrogant simply because it's fun, though it is often that. (Often, pronounced ""offen"". *Laughs* Mock Trial joke, cause LP is full of hicks.)

I'm missing Angelica today. We had a lunch free of club meetings today, and she wasn't here. I was planning on calling her during fifth period, but we have a sub. No go. I hope she's allright.

I've been reading a lot of other people's journals recently. Carrie sure seems to be having a hard time. She deserves much better, but as Eastwood put it, ""Deserve's got nothing to do with it.""  I'm certain that many men ""want"" her, she just isn't aware. (Hell, I considered a relationship with her a few months before Angelica and I started dating. No offense, Carrie, but I think Angelica was just a tad, *Winks*, better for me.)

Bryan and Tanner seem good. I was worried about their relationship, with the shift to college and longdistance, but they hold up well. Tanner seems happy, anyways.

Our Academic Decathalon competition is this Saturday. We've a good group this year, and competing with nine rather than last year's eight. For some reason though, I find this time around to be much less fun, less of an enjoyable time. Maybe it's the higher expectation of victory, where last year there was none. Or maybe it's the rampant crudity of some of this year's members as compared to Bryan's wit, Betsy's literature brilliance, Brad's mathmatical genius, me the Junior Prodigy, or any of the others. Maybe I'm just being the quintessential stodgy veteran.

In any case, I'm a bit nervous. With less than four days to go, some of the team is still far from prepared by my standards. I think they'll be crushed when they are faced with the enormity of the challenge. Will all the other schools have prepared so little?

***

Mock Trial also approaches, and with it the true proving of my new double role. I am defense pretrial attorney as I was last year, but in addition I am a supporting prosecution attorney this year as well. A traitor, I call myself, despite our shared team of prosecution and defense. *Winks*

I'm much less worried about our success in Mock Trial. We have, as always, many capable and intelligent members, and the pressure feeds us. Or it doees me, in any case.

The formal last Saturday was a great deal of fun, though it did bankrupt me entirely. I don't usually enjoy dances, but I do enjoy wearing my suit. Angelica and my friends roped me into having fun, I suppose. We took two group pictures, as well as the couple shot of Angelica and I. One group had 14 members, and the other 17. Quite a bit larger than the picture I adore from my sophomore prom.

It's been a while since I've written in my livejournal, and I've barely used it at all. For a long time I desired one, and I was overjoyed when I recieved my invitational password. I think that perhaps I am too private a person internally.

I'm very public, externally. I have no problem talking to anyone, even comeplete strangers. I'm honest, and open-minded. (Or so I think.) And yet, many of my most internal aspects remain hidden from even my close friends. It's mostly my own insecurity, I'm afraid. It rarely seems as though anyone understands the way I think and live, and when someone does make a brief connective glimpse, I share more, and they lose understanding, and I retreat mentally.

It hurts more, that so few ever even notice the fact of my mental privacy. Those I do end up sharing with to a greater extent always are driven into depression when I am cheerful. It is almost as though my sharing of comprehension off-syncs anyone else, if that makes any sense.

Surprisingly, I have no homework over the weekend, which gives me far too much superfluous brain focus to waste.

A friend of mine, who shall remain nameless, decided to make of me less a friend recently. It hurt, a bit, but I resolved to change not a whit my friendship, and if they wished to change their's, it was their choice, but would have no impact on my regard of compassion to them. Still, it had me thinking for quite some time as to the true nature of my friendships. A friend should be someone who makes life easier for you, makes it more fufilling or generally more fun. Do I do that for all of my friends? Or can a friend be someone who suffers through the bad times with you, regardless of mutual happiness, just because they are loyal and devoted. That I know I am, and so I must let my fears go, and live my life as I see it. Sometimes it isn't all fun, but it's all worth it.

It's always somewhat depressing to know that all of your friends are out and about when you are at home, wishing you were. On the same topic, I wish I could go to the bowling alley more often to play DDR, but neither my finances nor my schedule allows me.

Speaking of schedules, mine's terribly busy. One of the many redeeming factors to being as horrendously busy as I am, I suppose, is that so many of my activities are shared with my friends, such as Shawn and Angelica. It isn't truly quality time, though. Sometimes ""association"" doesn't replace simply hanging out.

Today was Palermo Field Day, an annual festival for the hamlet I happen to inhabit. I slept in, joyfully, then went there a little before to meet up with Angelica and Carrie. I was unaware that they were to be onduty as key club members for the entire duration of their stay, selling tickets for ""Pig Potty Bingo."" (Don't ask.) I tagged along with them for a bit, cruised the stalls for a bit, and ended up buying a paperback to peruse while I waited till five, when we were to leave.

Angelica's mother gave Carrie a ride and we, (Angelica and I), went to her house and hung out until just about forty five minutes ago. Among other things, we watched Silence of the Lambs. Suprisingly, she'd never seen it. *Shakes his head* One of my favorite movies, for some unknown, but visceral, reason.

I had a good evening, (Pizza and romance always make for good times), but as always, I wish it could have lasted longer. There are simply not enough hours in the day, and too many restrictions upon, well, everything! *Sighs, and laughs*

In any case, I am tired, and my fingers ache. I'll sign off, and with luck, I actually will be able to write more frequent entries.

"event","I've had livejournal for about a week now, but this has been the first time I've been online since then, due to the business of school's first days.

This just passed night I got to see Vanities, the play put on by the local young adults' theatre group, including my love Angelica, and friends Haley and Carrie. It was very, very funny, especially the play of sarcasm and naive innocence between the ""over-sexed"" Carrie, and the ""juvenile"" Haley. A few lines were missed or flopped, but overall I enjoyed it greatly. (Then again, I've never attended a three-act play I didn't enjoy.)

Both casts and several of the friends, including myself, went out to Cornicopia after the perfomence, and we ordered assorted foods, deserts, and etc. while chatting about far too much sex and linked topics. *Laughs* Ah well, I'm sure we shocked Haley's father, who was also there.

Angelica was having a good time too, or so it seemed, but quite suddenly she grew depressed, and though I tried to discover the cause, I do not think she knew either. Perhaps merely a moodswing, but I think it is more deeply rooted. In any case, when she returned she faced yet more frustrations and stresses, which I'll leave her journal to describe.

My morning is going well, though I listen to over a hundred voice soundbytes from Alpha Centauri in the somewhat futile attempt to look for the word ""Revolution."" (Don't aask.) I have the extremely strong urge to dance, whether it be in the middle of my living room or on DDR, but that would require not being online. *Laughs* Yeah, right. This is the first time I've been online since Monday night.

I've been doing quite a bit of DDR recently, whether at home, or draining cash at the bowling alley. I've begun to devolop a style, (freestyling), and so I need LOTS of practice. But, slowly, I'm getting better. It's amazing how fun the game is, and how difficult it is to tire of it, thought it tires you.

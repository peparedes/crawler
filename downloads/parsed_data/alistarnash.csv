I've learned to accept all of the bullshit that comes with an everyday existence. I skim over the years I've spent on this god forsaken hell hole...and I have a smile on my face???? What the fuck....am I nuts...am I a fruit loop short of a bowl of cereal? What turns a perpetual grimace into a smile? I think it may have to do with family and friends.

"event","I have devised a fiendishly clever way of renting movies for free. It is not actually free per-se, but it is the next best thing.A movie chain near my house sells previous viewed movies for $5 a movie. This includes some of the newest releases. I buy four of these movies, watch them at my leisure without worrying about late fines. I then take these movies to Blockbuster(very close to my house also)where they give you $5 or more for each movie.I then choose to rent another movie from Blockbuster or keep the money.Is this not fiendishly clever? Another example, You know how people keep movies they rent for the maximum days allotted to them. There is an incentive to returning movies early, 1. You avoid late charges if some crazy occurrence fucks up your routine 2. You get a dollar in credit to rent another movie. A dollar might not seem like much and it really isn't, but if you're a movie buff like me, they add up quick. My intellect is wasted on the stupidest shit isn't it..heh. 

Use my jedi insanity well my patawans, it's always good to save yourself some green. Plus, renting movies for free utilizes the dork side of the force."

You risk your own safety to plow the roads for commuters and you should be thanked properly. I raise my sock hat and gloves in salute to to your excellent service.Without the services of these men and women, a lot of people would be six feet deep or...hospitalized in form fitting paper ma che.We all see cars in ditches on the way to work and school...Right? So imagine those same drivers on the road without it being plowed...*I shudder to think about it*. Well thats enough of that rambling...lol.

I woke up this morning, threw back my comforter, swung out of bed and tripped over my cross trainers hit my head against my desk. There was a loud meaty smack, I stumbled like a drunk and crumpled to the floor.I lay motionless on my bedroom floor, groaning and holding the gash in my forehead. It felt like an elephant sat on my face and 'passed gas*' (*humiliation factor). I recovered seconds later and disinfected the cut.I was pissed at my utter carelessness and for being a clumsy oaf.I look at the shoes with a steely glare and I grumble under my breath. Damn exercise shoes almost took me out....damn them....and their fancy gel insoles. I left the shoes by the bed, because I  planned on taking my dogs for a walk. 

I got bundled up like a Siberian Cossack, which greatly reduces ones agility, and leashed up the pups. I wanted to exercise the dogs and a walk seemed to be what I needed to cool off. I headed out the door into the cold. The walk was as dandy as English aristocracy. My dog's sniffed a few butts and trees, urinated on a tree or four...you know all the normal dog stuff. Everything changed when I arrived at the park. It seems that the recent snowfall covered a 4 inch hole in the ground. Needless to say, I tripped and skated across the ground like a human bobsled.Luckily, I was unhurt and managed to round up the pups before their curiosity got the better of them.Yup,I'm a moron...heh..heh.I walked back to the house without incident thank Jesus(Hey-Zeus). This is UN-FUCKING BELIEVABLE, I'm a danger to myself and others today....stay far far away."

I had to hit the sheets early Friday, because I had to work at 4:00am Saturday morning. I usually don't hit the sheets too early and when I do, a fucking blizzard ravages my community. I haven't been watching the news lately, so I was unaware of the shitstorm blowing through.See, my dumb ass needs to pay more attention to current events..heh..heh..oh..crimeny...jimeny. 

I had a pretty good day yesterday. I bought a shit load of video games from Blockbuster. They were having a buy two get one free sale,so I bought like fifteen games. What can I say....my willpower sucks when it comes to reduced price nerdage. The game I'm loving currently, is Resident Evil Outbreak. That game is soo pimp, there is nothing more rewarding than blowing up a city of zombies. I also, borrowed Silent Hill 3 from a buddy of mine(damn Blockbuster didn't have it). I love the Silent Hill games, They rock my socks in ball form. I'm still working on Silent Hill 2, but I'm at the end. 

I also rented Anchor Man, I fucking love Will Ferrell. I laughed as hard as a stoned Hyena, especially when Jack Black gets hit with a burrito. The fight scene between Ron and Veronica was awesome too. 

P.S. I haven't updated in awhile and I apologize. I've been busy with work and writing...well thats all for now. I hope everyone has a good weekend :)."

Now onto my nonsensical entry.... I woke up one morning and walked into my main washroom...I looked around and was dissatisfied with the surroundings.The walls were painted blue, the toilet was white, the fixtures were gold...it needed a change.Refinishing my washroom took  a lot less time than I though it would.I attacked the project with a frenzied passion...with blood sweat and beers, not to mention cigarettes. I installed a new toilet, fixtures, shower curtain,floor tile and painted the washroom. I woke up this morning and seemed to have quite a lot of energy, so I tackled the task.I painted the walls a silky beige and put in hardwood floor tile; Next, I installed the beige toilet,sink and tub.I looked over my work after I was finished...I was speechless...it was beautiful.I guess spending a few months with my uncle the carpenter in Georgia paid off. 

Remodeling my washroom was not an inconvenience because I have three washrooms and two showers in the house. I frequented these other less satisfying facilities, while my main washroom was under construction. I need to start working on the other washrooms...arggg.

I was impressed with her action skills. Wesley Snipes was of course awesome in the role of Blade. I liked all of the previous Blade movies and have them on DVD(If you couldn't tell I'm a real Marvel Comic's nerd)The only thing about Blade that was irritating was Dracula. I mean, why does an ancient vampire have a gold chain that would put Mr.T's to shame. He even had the damn chain on when he changed forms. I was like,""no way is that chain going to metamorph with him is it"" and it did alright. 

I seen Troy as well(what can i say it was a rainy day..heh..heh). The movie rocked the foundations of the universe. I was sooo impressed with this movie. I am definitely going to buy it. It will be placed in the same row of movies as the Punisher, Last samurai, Clerks, Crouching Tiger, Iron Monkey, Dark City,Bill & Ted,Buffy the vampire Slayer and Kurosawa's Ran. I wasn't expecting the movie to rule as much as it did...go and rent this movie now. That is the only command I'll give today..lol J/K. 

I also gave my two dog's a much needed bath. With all the rain we're getting they're filthy with mud every day. I have to clean them constantly because they love playing in the rain...silly pup's.They alway's love thrashing around, while I'm trying to bathe them. Especially my Black Lab/German Shepard, she loves making me furious then licking my face and giving me that vacant expression of her's.

My bed was doing the disco slide so I decided to get up and move around a bit. I found that to be the worst idea of them all. I won't get all detailly, but IT WAS A REALLY BAD IDEA. My equilibrium is at odd's with me at present and there's a microscopic guy with a jackhammer inside my head. (right about now you think I drank like a fish huh?) Nope! I'm buzzing off paint fumes(well and some beer's as well,but I don't drink a lot). That's right I took avantage of our Indian Summer and painted my house.

The interior of my house needed a good coat of paint. I went to the store and picked up some white latex paint.White is probably my favorite color for an interior of a house.Indoors,the color white bring's a luster to the decor of the house. It reflect's light through the entire house brightening up dark corners. I'm really happy with the results. The house has a briliant radiance from the little work applied. Like every painter worth their weight,I got more paint on me than on the walls.

I open up the front door and I'm frozen like frosty..(damn..I'm thinking this is a bad idea). Well...I brave the cold and go out to warm up my car,I leave it run for five minutes and have some coffee. 

I go outside and enter the blistfull warmth that is my car(I love my car). So I'm in a good mood and am in good spirits. I get to the mall, park my car and traverse the many shop's. I came out of there with nothin' that's right no ideas...no merchandise...nada. I forgot my wallet at home*I curse my memory and lack of one...* and head back home. I grab the wallet and head back.

Now the mall is packed...it's jumping like Jordan on crack. I drive around for awhile and see a spot*rub my eyes* That's right ROCK STAR parking, right in front of the mall. I'm elated that i won't be freezing my ass off walking to the mall. I notice the guy ringing the bell outside and I feel bad for him,it's like FUCKING ASS COLD outside and he's ringing a bell out there. I deposit two dollars into the bin and make a beeline to Gloria Jeans(coffee) I buy a large coffee and bring it out to the guy, I wish him a merry Christmas and commence my shopping.

Some of the soccer mom's were giving me the 'evil eye' for blocking the isles while reading the signs....(What's up with that). I apologized for being in THEIR way and they were less than appreciative (I got a EXCUSE MEEEE or a Outa the WAyyy)I was like ok...sorry for existing. 

I gathered all of the products I was looking for and headed to the register to pay. while on my way to the front....I heard a wail like a thunderclap..I whipped my head around and looked to see if a wounded mule had somehow stumbled into the store. Nope, it was a little kid whining about something. This kid had the pipes of an opera singer, I mean damn. I was looking at the frail little soccer mom and see seemed perplexed as what to do. To make things worse this kid grabbed onto my cart as I try to pass him. (ok let me tell you something I don't dislike children, but this kid was pissing me off). I tell the mom to please do something about her child, he was on a verge of throwing a shitstorm of a tantrum.  Well she tried to talk to the little hellspawn, but to no avail. So I took charge of the situation, I looked at the kid with my mean face and the little dude started laughing...LAUGHING....Ok..well at least I got him to calm down. 

I really wish parents knew how to control their children. A little discipline would go along way with these children.More parents have to take childcare more seriously, the child is pure innocence as he enters the world and is shaped by his surroundings. I was raised with very strict discipline (my father being in the military) and i think i turned out a... little... normal.

"event","I woke up at 7:00am on the 8th of december to make it down to the courthouse at 9:00am. I showered, shaved and did the rest of my morning routine. I threw on some jeans and a T-shirt and headed out the door. Being tired and cold, I went to Starbucks for a pick me up. I chatted with the cashier who has a crush on me and got my venti coffee for free(gotta love it). I drove from Romeoville to Downtown Joliet, without spilling a drop of the coffee.

I arrived in Town at 7:45am.While in joliet, I drove all over looking for a parking spot that was not a million miles away from the court house(I was unsuccessfull).Wow...after about half and hour I find a spot,I parked by one of the hourly meters and watched the meter maid give someone a ticket. *chuckling evilly* I deposited .50 in the meter, which gives me two hours. I had to walk about two miles to the court house and it was freezing outside.My coffee was ice cold by the time I reached my destination. I ended up tossing half the cup in a trash receptacle. I enter the building freezing my ass off and am harassed by the guard's there about my studded leather belt(bastards). I told them I'd take it off, but they gave me attitude anyhow.

The line into the courtroom was half a mile long. It was long past nine o the clock when we were seated and checked in (our vigilant legal system running like a well oiled machine). When they actually called my name, I was told to come back on the 13th of January...WTF. I was pissed...I waited all this fucking time to get this shit over with, only to have to come back again in January. I FUCKING HATE OUR LEGAL SYSTEM AND ALL IT""S BULLSHIT!!!"

"event","I woke up this morning and started my usual exercise routine, Sit ups, push ups, weight training and treadmill. I love the feeling you get after a good work out. I took a shower then had a Blueberry scone to replace some of the energy I spent. While having breakfast I decided to break out my camera and take holiday Photo's of my Black LAb/German Shepard.

I got out the Santa hat and attempted to put it on my dog. This was an exercise in futility, my dog Nikki went ape shit and tore the shit out my living room. My lamp was knocked over by my flailing Shepard's ""Tail O DOOM"", the candy dish went sailing across the living room like a rocket and smashed against the bay window. I was like, ""WHAT THE FUCK""! Skittles were scattered to the four corners of the earth, I hunted for them like I was looking for Saddam. 

I finally calmed Nikki down by giving her a treat. She get's so excited when you try to take her picture,(Doggie Diva) I guess she doesn't like the flash, I dunno. Argggg..... I love my dog's, but they make me soooo mad sometimes.

My day started off in Tenor, then crashed into barritone. Ah... I still had fun and got the picture too. I'll try to post it sometime before Christmas. Peace."

So, without further ado, Chronicles of Riddick blew me away. The plot was cool, Riddick is an awsome character, it had a fucking legion of nercromunga's(see it you'll see) + it had Gwen from Angel(Yummy Sweeeetness personified). If you rent or buy this movie, get the special edition it is so worth it.

I'm listening to pretty hate machine""grooving"" when ""smash""! some jack off in a pick up hits me in the rear. I get out of my nissan altima to inspect the damage(which is not even a year old)I restain myself from ripping the fuckers head off,I tell him to pull into the nearest gas station. He tell's me that some truck driver gave him the finger,so he was not paying attention to the road. I tell him to give me his insurance info and I get the police to come to the scene.

  I wait for abot twenty minutes for the cop to show up and when he does, the bastard makes me wait for another forty. While he sit's comfortly in his air conditioned car doing paper work. The cop doesn't even look at the damage on the car,then writes on the police report that it was less than $500( I got multiple estimates that indicate the damage being more than a thousand dollar's).

  Now after all the fun, I'm playing phone tag with the claim's adjuster from ""pick up's"" insurance company."

"event","So the second day didn't go so well. The class was absolutely packed, which was a bit unnerving but otherwise all right, and the teacher was really nice. I made it just over half way through the class and then I got super dizzy. I tried sitting a couple poses out and then joining in, but it was even worse. I finally had to leave the room. I felt fine other than being dizzy...I mean, I was sore and tired, but in a good way. I've had this kind of thing happen before...If I'm in the shower for too long, or if I go in before I have breakfast, I get dizzy to the point where I feel like I'm going to pass out. I don't know how to get rid of it...It's frustrating, though. Anyway...I think I'm going to try a Yin class tomorrow, just to give myself a break. Apparently it can take a long time to get used to the hot classes, so maybe it will get better...We'll see."

"event","YYoga in Vancouver is doing a 30 day challenge, where participants aim to do 30 yoga classes in 30 days. I am adding to this by doing 30 days of a vegan diet.

Yesterday was the first day...I started the day with some yummy oatmeal and banana, with a half scoop of vegan protein powder. I had some barley toast with hummus for lunch, and a side of Terra vegetable chips. I discovered afterwards that these chips have whey in the flavouring, and are therefore not vegan. Sigh. Who would think that Mediterranean flavoured vegetable chips wouldn't be vegan? Obviously not me.

I spent the day reading book four of the Percy Jackson series, mostly in my pyjamas. At around 16h30 I caught the skytrain downtown to meet my mum for our first class. YYoga has a few different locations, three of which my mum and I will be trying; the one we went to last night was their Flow location. It is pretty intimidating...Beautiful, but intimidating.

We scanned our cards at the front to sign into the class, and then got our mats and towels (we signed up for the plus option, which means no mat cleaning or lugging gear...Definitely worth the 20$, in my opinion). Around the corner from the front desk is a shoe room full of cubbies. We took our shoes off and moved on to the change room. I wouldn't have been able to find it on my own, but my mum has been there before. Nearly everything is made of frosted glass, with simple, subtle signage. Too subtle for me. Also, the frosted glass washroom stalls are a bit disconcerting. The lockers in the change room are all wood with push-button combination locks. Everything has been designed to feel elegant without being over the top. 

Our class was held in the Fire room. I assume that all of the hot classes are held in this room. Walking in was like walking into a sauna, only with much better lighting and no creepy fat men leering at me. We found spots on the far side of the room, and lay out our mats and towels.

We sat in the heat for a few minutes before the teacher came in, and I have to admit that it was pretty relaxing -- so relaxing that I was ready to go to sleep. That changed once class started. Our teacher explained that she didn't want us to drink water until a certain point in the class, because the point of the hot class was to sweat out as many impurities as possible.

As we went through the poses, most of which I wasn't familiar with, I sweat more than I have ever sweated in my life. It was running off me, dripping into my eyes...But everyone around me was glistening and wiping themselves with their towels, so I didn't feel too uncomfortable about it. 

The class brought out a bunch of emotions for me...At one point I was feeling dizzy (as I often do when I get overheated) and went to drink water; the teacher told me not to drink any yet, encouraged me to get back into the pose. I couldn't do the pose (Camel, which apparently causes a lot of people to become dizzy), so I sat on my mat and waited. But I felt like I was going to burst into tears...It wasn't that big of a deal, but the combination of the heat and the poses brought a lot of emotion to the surface.

I felt okay afterwards...Good physically, not so great emotionally. It was hard staring at myself in a mirror for a full hour, and hard feeling the limits of my body. I mean, I know we all have limits, but I feel like mine are closing in on me. My hips, my shoulders, my back...Everything hurts. 

My hip was killing me when I woke up this morning, as usual, and my back hurts. The back pain is a good one, though, because it feels like I've been using my muscles. 

I'm trying another hot class tonight...And I've done a better job of sticking to my vegan diet today. I started out with the oatmeal/protein powder/banana combo, then had a super-healthy smoothie: the other half of the banana, strawberries, peanut butter, flax oil, greens+ and some more protein powder. I was pretty hesitant about drinking it, but it was surprisingly good. I think I might cut the peanut butter out, because it adds a lot of fat and calories. I'm going to have some barley toast and hummus for lunch, and some tofu and salad for supper. And I think I'll have some almonds before yoga, to try to prevent dizziness."

"event","I don't know what I have to say I just need to write and it's faster for me to type than it is to write with a pen and the way my thoughts are moving I need to be fast to catch as many as I can and try to pin them down so that I can figure out what I want from him from life from myself and try to figure out how I feel about him leaving. I feel sad that I've lost the person who seemed to understand me care about me no matter how crazy I was. But maybe I am just afraid that no one else will ever be able to see past the real me. Maybe I don't actually need him. Except I think I do. Everyone tells me I don't need him, I don't need to depend on him. Well, Nekita tells me this anyway. And I don't need him to live, I am strong and I can carry on without him in my life.

But I want him. I want to feel his arms around my waist again, and I want him to kiss me, and I want to hear him breathing and grinding his teeth when he sleeps and I want to wake up to his grouchiness and I want to be a part of his life again. But I'm not right now and I'm pretty sure that he's happy with that and I don't want to rain on his parade I don't want to make him unhappy with my presence but I want him to be happy with me around. But he's not. So I need to get over that get over myself and move on. But I don't want to move on because I always felt that since he loved me (or I thought he did) and he wanted to be with me even after seeing me at my worst, I always thought this meant that there was a chance for me to be with someone, to be happy with someone, for someone to truly love me. And now he doesn't love me and doesn't want to be with me so what does that mean? am I lost and no one will ever love me? And everyone will tell me that's silly and I am loveable and don't worry it will all work out and I'll find the person who's right for me someday but I really wanted him to be the right person and I thought that maybe he could be and I'm stupid and naive and I wish sometimes that I had just walked away instead of leaping into something with such high stakes. But I don't wish away the time we spent together, so I don't wish I had walked away. I just wish that things could continue and I didn't feel like I was losing one of the most important people in my life.

and I know all the logic, and I know that maybe this isn't the end, and I don't know what will happen because I can't see the future.

But I feel like this is ending, and I feel like my heart is shattering, and I don't know what to do because I can't convince him anymore and I can't pretend that he wants to be with me so I guess I should just accept that he doesn't want to be with me and doesn't love me and I should just walk away. 

why can I never walk away?"

"event","Someone in my class recently said that he wished he could have his heart broken, to inspire his art. 

My heart is breaking into a million pieces every day. And there is nothing I can do to fix things, because I don't even know what the problem is.

This isn't inspiring. I want to curl up in my bed and cry and never come out.

He won't talk to me. I know that I should let him have his space, let him breathe and think. But I don't know what's going on. All I know is that he is shutting me out of his life, he is ignoring me, and I have heard nothing positive from him in two weeks.

I should probably give up.

But I love him. I really, truly love him. And I hurt right now...More than I have hurt in a long time. I'm having trouble breathing, and I physically hurt. And I can tell myself that it's better this way, that if he doesn't appreciate what we have then it's not worth sticking around for.

But I love him.

And I didn't think this could happen with him. I didn't think I could lose him like this. I thought he would always be in my life. Why am I so foolish again and again? Why don't I learn?

I should probably give up.

But what does that say about me, if I am willing to walk away when it gets tough?

Although, that's exactly what he seems to be doing.

I just want him to love me. Does that make me pathetic?"

"event","For that one brief moment she was on solid ground. For that one brief moment they communicated. There was no drama, no angst, for that one brief moment.

<i>Am I not pretty enough? / Is my heart too broken? / Do I cry too much? / Am I too outspoken? / Don't I make you laugh? / Should I try it harder? / Why do you see right through me?</i>

But she is never enough, and she is always there. In the wings, waiting. Patiently. For all the other girls to come and go, for everything else in life to get sorted out.

She is never a priority, because she is always there.

<i>I'm going to turn and walk away / you wait till I am far along / then run and come and catch my arm / and say you'd die if I were gone...</i>

She longs for someone to tell her what she already knows, that she is worth it. She longs for someone who will fight for her, chase after her, someone who will not let her walk away.

For that one brief moment she was confident that things were different. But there is always someone better. And angst-filled words are the only way to express her frustration and her hurt. Because there are no words to describe what she does not know.

Just when she thinks she's falling in love, it all seems to fall apart.

The other girls walks back into his life, and suddenly he is gone. In so many ways.

<i>It's really good to hear your voice say my name / it sounds so sweet / coming from the lips of an angel / hearing those words / it makes me weak</i>"

"event","When you said that you were disappointed that I didn't open up more to you while you were visiting I heard more. I heard all the disappointment that I had felt from you for so many years, all that unspoken failure. 

You walked away from me, without cutting the strings attached to my heart. You led me on. I got up the courage to leave, but I needed to put a country between us. I left to escape you. Even then it was difficult. I was hurting and angry and waiting for you to tell me that you still cared.

For so many years all I wanted was to feel wanted. For so many years I felt guilty for the hell I had been through.

When you voiced your disappointment more resentment than I knew I had bubbled to the surface and spilled over. A slap in the face couldn't have hurt more. But I finally realized that I couldn't keep fighting for someone who didn't want to fight for me. I need more than that, and I deserve better than that.

I am mostly done waiting to feel wanted by you, and I am mostly done feeling guilty. You've moved on, I know that, and down a different path than I have. And that's OK.

I miss what we had, though. The friendship aspect. I think a small part of me will always wonder if, somehow, things could have been different. No surprises there...You were important in my life, how could I not wonder?

I know this is almost a year late, I know you have moved on, and I know that this is unnecessary. Except I didn't get to say good-bye. So here it is.

Good-bye."

the beads I wore for so many years
when they broke I felt like I could let go
and the candy phone
with your nice words
but after so many words
I have finally given up on you
because words only mean so much
and only get you so far
and the things I have clung to
have used to keep that connection
don't mean anything
because I can see now
that I deserve more than words
that I deserve a friend who is
present in my life
and I am not angry
I am just

This weather is brutal!

I'm super excited about going camping next weekend...It's been so long! And I get to see my family, none of whom I have seen for 2 years.

It's been around 30 degrees the last couple of days, and there might be a thunderstorm...I hope there is, as we haven't even had one yet this year!

I'm really tired, and could easily go to sleep right now. But I won't.

I had a really good run this morning...It set me off for a good day.

This entry is all over the place, but whatever. So is my hair."

I spent 150$ at MEC today. Ouch. But I got a couple new t-shirts, a sweatshirt, running capris, a waist pack, water bottle, plus some chocolate =) And most of the clothing is made from organic cotton, so that makes it worth it to me. I'd really like to recreate my entire wardrobe with clothing made from either organic or more sustainable materials, or both. Unfortunately, I am finding it difficult to find clothing that suits my style and/or budget. I'm sure there are good stores here, I just need to find them.

Not much else going on here...I should run to the papeterie and the health food store. I've been trying out different whole grains lately. I was on a tabouli kick for a couple of weeks (tabouli is made with bulgar wheat), and the last couple of days I was back onto a quinoa and chickpeas kick (oh my goodness, so delicious). I also tried millet, but wasn't terribly impressed with it. My cupboards are bare now, and I think I'm going to try kamut and kasha. I've also got some black beans soaking in the fridge, but they take awhile to cook, so I don't think I'll do those tonight. Or maybe I'll cook them tonight and save them for tomorrow.

"event","I was putting the kids to bed last night when my five year old brought out the tough questions. He started out with ""Was God alive? I mean, a really long time ago, before the dinosaurs, was he alive?"", and moved on to questions like ""Who made the earth?"". He told me that at school they give thanks to God before they eat, and some of the books they have include stories about God, but I guess since he doesn't go to church he's never really learned about the concept of God, or religion. And who am I to teach him? I am very cynical towards organized religion, but I want him to figure out what he thinks about religion, on his own.

I settled for explaining a little bit about the Bible, going over the basics of evolution (we've talked about it before, but it's a hard concept to explain to a 5 year old...Their concept of time is very limited, and the idea of billions of years is hard to illustrate), and also mentioning the idea of different gods and religions. I told him that lots of people believe in God, but nobody really knows if He is real or not. He thought about it, and then said to me ""I don't think he's real, because there are no fossils of him...""

When we were talking about the Bible, he asked who wrote it. I told him that God told people what He wanted written, which prompted him to ask <i>how</i> He told them. Not being too familiar with the Bible, I guessed that they just heard a voice. He asked me if we ever heard His voice, so I turned it around and asked him if he ever did. ""Yes...The wind.""

We moved onto vegetarianism after that...He told me he thinks eating meat is wrong, because animals were alive too and they shouldn't be killed. Unfortunately, he likes bacon a lot; he decided that it would be ok if he just ate bacon, because <i>he's</i> not actually killing any animals.

I love kids..."

Unfortunately, my roommate's brother brought it back from Denmark or someplace, and I'm not sure if it's available here =( I might try Green & Black's Mayan Gold, as it looks somewhat similar, and they are organic whereas Lindt is not.

I am still a little sick, but not nearly as bad as I was, and I get to go back to work today! Yay!

It is sooo nice today. There has been a change in the air, and all of a sudden it feels like summer is just around the corner. It's supposed to get up to the 20s in the next couple of days. Strange to think that it was snowing on Tuesday.

I'm very happy to be finished school for the term. Even though I literally did NO work this term, it has had a constant presence, lingering in the back of my mind, causing me a lot of stress. This was definately not my best term academically, but I'm trying not to be too hard on myself. I think that, given the circumstances, one term of poor performance and absolute apathy regarding school is understandable and acceptable.

Plans are coming along for the summer...I'm looking forward to travelling and being busy. The change in the weather is making a significant difference in my attitude, and I'm quite glad for it. I think the time just before summer and just after summer are my favourite times of the year. And I don't mean spring and fall, I mean the changing times...When you can smell summer on the air, but the oppressive heat hasn't started yet. When the leaves start to change colour, but the evenings are still warm enough to enjoy a cold beer on the balconey. Those times when you have the best of both seasons."

It is a political/enviromental documentary showing sharks in a completely different light than mainstream media does. I learned so much, and was amazed by the courage and passion that director Rob Stewart showed, as well as the beauty of the undersea world. I have to say that I've never given much thought to sharks, but this film changed that.

It opens on March 23rd, and I recommend that you all go to see it. It is quite an incredible film. Plus (if you need further incentive) Rob is really cute.

After the film we had a couple drinks at the Cock 'n Bull, where some of the guys joined us. It was really nice to see them again, and I found out that they will be a part of the Sketch Fest this year, and will have a show while Steph is visiting. Lucky Steph will get to see the Cock Bros!

I have discovered a really yummy chocolate...It is 60% cocao, organic, fair trade, and made with quinoa, which gives it a bit of a crunch. Very yummy, and a couple squares of that is a nice alternative to preservative laden desserts.

Things are going really well for me...I got a new computer, a new (digital) camera, I received a VERY nice job offer, I've been spending weekends in the country...And, the two midterms that I had? The ones for the classes that I stopped going to at the beginning of the term, and didn't do the reading for? 90% on one, 89% on the other. 

Despite all these nice things, I have been feeling a bit down of late...I think it's due in part to the weather. It's sunny most days, but it's been sitting around -30 with windchill, and that makes it a lot harder to go out for walks, so I've been severely lacking in fresh air and excercise. I just got back from a nice long walk, and I couldn't feel my legs when I got home. 45 minutes later and I'm still chilled. But it did feel good to get out.

I've got to get my stats stuff together and get to work now...I'm really frustrated with stats this term. It's not that it's difficult, but we are being made to do everything by hand...With 100 scores to deal with, finding the sum of x, plus the sum of x squared, that makes for a lot of writing...And it's basic addition, so it's really not teaching us anything. Unnecessary, but I suppose a lot of assignments are."

"event","It seems that winter is finally here. Snowfall warning, and crazy blowing snow...And it's supposed to go down to -24 (before windchill) on Wednesday! Hopefully I'll be able to go skating soon!
My poor bike is sitting outside, without a seat, rusted chains, frozen lock...
I have to pick up a package, but it's way out in the middle of nowhere, and it's cold and windy and gross out, so I think I'll do that tomorrow.
My wireless router crapped out last night, and I'm really not sure why. It just...turned off. And Dave (my engineer roomie) is gone for a couple of days, so I'm stuck in the living room with a very short leash on my computer. Which isn't too bad, but I wish I could figure out what happened to my router.

I'm really cold, and tired. Today was good though...Saw my five year old's Christmas show, which was quite cute. And tomorrow the other two have their show.

I'm leaving soon, and I'm starting to panic a bit. I need to bake, and I need to get presents, and I feel so unprepared. And I'm in a Christmas mood when I'm not thinking, but as soon as I start thinking it leaves.'

This Christmas will be strange. I don't want to think about it, but I need to so that I can actually deal with it. I have no idea how to go about dealing with it though. I'm no good at pretending things are ok when they're not...But I have a feeling I'll need to do a lot of that this year.

I have so many questions about the logistics, but I know that there aren't really any answers right now. I hate not having answers. And I hate not being able to fix things, not being able to make lists and organize things until they look better.

Anyways. I think I'm going to go to bed early tonight."

I am so fucking pissed off with fucking beurocracies!

I got yet ANOTHER letter today about my residency. Because I subletted my current apartment for the month of June neither of my landlord letters cover that period, so they can't approve me for residency until they get for THAT FUCKING MONTH. Because I might have left the province for the one month or something. Today is the deadline for having stuff in if I want to get my money back for this term's tuition. And I don't even know how I'm supposed to get a letter, because I didn't have a lease for that time. I asked my aunt and uncle to do it for up to June 31st, but they thought it would be better not to, for some reason (which made sense at the time...although I can't remember the reason now).

And the birthday card I sent my dad was apparently slightly oversized so it was three cents short on postage and got returned to me.

And I'm just so tired. So so tired. And I want to walk until I stop feeling so hurt, but there's a freezing rain warning right now, and I don't want to go outside. 

And I was looking forward to go home to relax, but now it won't be relaxing. And I don't want to be around people right now, I don't want to see anybody or talk to anybody, because I hurt. And everybody keeps telling me it's going to be ok, and maybe it will, but right now it feels like my whole fucking life is falling apart.

They were supposed to be the fix'd foot on my compass. They were my stability. Home for the past 15 years doesn't exist anymore. How can I go home when it doesn't exist?

I don't know how I'm going to finish my paper and write my final when all I want to do is curl up and cry.

And nobody understands...I don't understand...



<b>EDIT</b>: Apparently when it's a little bit bigger they charge an extra 54 cents...not three cents. Oops."

But I'd be happy with the <a href=""http://www.pentax.ca/digital/digital_slr/k100d/index.php"">K100D</a>. Unfortunately I do not have 800-1200$ to spend on a camera right now.

I also learned, while browsing the pentax website, that the model that I had (the Pentax ME Super) was first made in December, 1979, and stopped being made in 1984. And considering that I got it used, it's not all too surprising that it doesn't work anymore.

So I'm saving up...Tuition, laptop, camera, travelling. I'd better win the lottery soon!

"event","Today is the first time I feel like my voice can be heard. I sent an email yesterday to the mayor of NDG/CDN asking that he vote against the proposal to change the name of Avenue du Parc to Avenue Robert Bourassa. Today I recieved an email from him, sent to a bunch of NDG/CDN residents stating that his job is to listen to the people he represents, and because of that he would be voting against the name change. I know it's not <i>because</i> of me, but I feel like somehow I was a part of that. Now hopefully the other Mayors will vote against it as well.

I'm so tired today...Work was pretty good, but then I got home and have barely been able to move since. I have to go out, and I should have gone to school to deal with bureaucratic shit, but instead I'm lying around drinking tea and eating organic dark chocolate with ginger pieces. Yummy.

"event","I am probably going to spam people with this later, but I will do it here as well.

About a month ago Montreal's Mayor Tremblay announced a decision that Avenue du Parc would have it's name changed to Robert Bourassa. He did this without a vote or any type of public consultation. Parc runs for 7km and many businesses will be affected because of this name change, and the residents of the area are not happy either.

Not only did Tremblay not hold a vote on this matter, but renaming the street after Robert Bourassa is very <a href=""http://www.mcgilldaily.com/view.php?aid=5508"">contreversial</a>. Plus, we already have a Henri Bourassa, and Robert has a library named after him. Isn't that enough? A lot of people say that if they <i>are</i> going to rename a street after him, why not choose a smaller street. Unfortunately, a lot of the suggestions for alternate streets are Saint streets, and that just won't fly here.

Changing the name of Avenue du Parc to Avenue Robert Bourassa does not make sense, and the way that the municipal government has gone about this change is irresponsible. If anyone feels the same way about this change, please sign <a href=""http://www.causes.ca/duparc"">this petition</a>. And if you don't have an opinion, sign it for me."

I guess it's sort of my fault though...The seat was loose, which is why I haven't been riding, and I kept meaning to fix it, but needed to borrow Dave's tools, and whenever he was around I would forget to ask, etc. So it was probably pretty easy to steal. But still! I'm trying to look on the bright side...It's going to start snowing soon and I probably won't be riding anyways, and my seat wasn't very comfortable, so now I can get a more comfortable one. But just the fact that somebody stole my bike seat upsets me.

And then yesterday evening I was pulling my jeans on and the button caught on my anklet and broke it. Steph gave me that anklet, and I've worn it for over 4 years without taking it off. It's been through a lot, and it finally broke when I was putting on my pants. And my ankle feels bare...=("

Got up at 7h30 when the 4 year old got me up, put on CBC kids, put out a bowl of Fruit Loops, got back into bed. Got up 10 minutes later to get the two year old up, changed his diaper, sent him downstairs to watch cartoons. Tried to go back to sleep, finally got up about 15 minutes later when the 5 year old got up. Got breakfast for everyone (fruit loops toast waffles peaches milk), made myself tea. Got dressed, got the kids teeth brushed, faces washed, dealt with fits when I turned the tv off, got jackets mitts toques boots for everyone, went to the park, played tag, brought everyone home. Hot dogs carrots and dip for lunch, more fits, finally nap time. Cleaned the kitchen, half an hour on the treadmill, stretched and weights, tea and tv, then everyone up again. Drew pictures, made snowflakes, potatoes in the oven, made filling for potatoes, back in the oven, got everyone at the table. Ate dinner, made sure kids were eating dinner, and made cookies simultaneously. Got kids in pjs, rooms cleaned, clothes out for tomorrow, handed out cookies, dealt with another fit when 2 year old didn't get one because he refused to eat dinner. Watched Backyardigans, put two year old to bed, more Backyardigans, bedtime story, charts, more fits, bedtime. Cleared dishes, put away leftovers, swept snowflake clippings and dinner off the floor, scrubbed table counters bench, picked up toys and crayons and pictures. TV. Treadmill again. I have a few more years until I'm ready to be a mother I think.
Three days down, two to go. Hopefully no one will wake up tonight and I will get a full night's sleep."

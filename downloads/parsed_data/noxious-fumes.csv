I'd ask her to show me her relevance to this but she absolutely refuses.

This girl she is stupid stupid, but she likes to play big girl games.

This girl likes to slip her fingers into peoples heads and twine them in deep and then, when she is quite bored, she will remove them -

now there are holes.

problem is, mature neuron cells are not mitotic. 

that's it.

What is love? Oh hi, cliche philosophical question.

But really.

Is it just looking at someone and knowing they've been down the same road you have? They've felt the deepest crevices of those dark nights where there never seems to be a dawn. The space between 1am and 6am seems everlasting. Those places where you wonder if your insides can possibly collapse on themselves or can you cause yourself an aneurysm simply by very...bad...thoughts.

Maybe its just chemical. Physical. Pheromones. You just really want that person because you're biology tells you so.

Maybe you're all fucked up and you want something bad for you. Maybe you're not taking anything seriously and you don't care as long as theres a warm body next to you regardless if their heart is cold.

I'm tired of thinking of this already because there's no absolute answer for me.

I can only conclude that I don't understand a thing called love. I don't understand it one bit and I possibly don't have a clue what it is.

It could be I'm only playing house in my head and you just fit very very nicely into my version of Ken.

My heart is erratic and it pulls in so many directions. Leave. Stay. Yearn. Withdraw. Love. Hate. Disgust. Love. Love. Love. Numb.

Risky passion or an eternal best friend?

It's all so confusing.

I just know that it's so hard to love properly when you're so involved in the selfish process of developing yourself and your future."

it makes me feel like my insides are crumbling.
it feels like my brain is electric and short fusing.

i feel like i'm caged.
these invisible bars you can't see but oh i feel them.
cold like metal.
stronger than anything tangible

things like these are all in my head
i want to make them all in the past

"event","I'm lazy. It'll take a bit to complete my friends list.

Anyways, I've changed a lot since I first created <lj-user=""violate"">. Specifically in the past few months. Being away from homw has changed me, I think for the better. I'm more responsible in a lot of ways and more confident. 3 years ago I had very little self-esteem and I had no confidence in myself and no high school diploma. Now I'm nearly half way done my bachelors and pulling good grades. Most of you have met me irl at some point. Most of you knew the former me, quiet and really disjointed. 

I look forward to introducing my new perspective. I look forward to seeing the world through a new vision. I look forward to the rest of my life.

Nice to meet you, again.

/end dramatic opening."

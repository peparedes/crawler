Ickiest.  Homecoming.  Ever.
I don't see how I used to enjoy Homecoming in the past years.
I did get Daniel out of his anti-social hole, only to find out later he was kicked out of the dance.  Oops.
I don't think I actually danced with my bf at all that night....I mean, we raved with each other out of fun & excitement or something, but not actually danced...*sigh*  To see a pair of my friends who were dating each other & being all romantic & dancing to a slow song brought a pang to my heart.
Too much shit was going on, I wasn't even supposed to BE at Homecoming, I spent $15 & argued endlessly for this?  To see a crowd of people dancing to a song that has a music video showing a girl getting raped?  To hear endless stream of crap rap music?  So not worth it.
After a few minutes of a natural high from a line of techno songs, my body just crashed.  I was thinking too much, & I just stressed myself out.  I couldn't get back into the euphoric, I-could-care-less state I was just in.  
It went from bad to worse.
It's like being at a party with drunk people.  If you're not drunk, you're definitely not having as much fun as all the other people who are drunk.  I just wanted to leave by then, but then I'd have to explain that to my rents.  So I ended up staying, figuring I only had about forty-five minutes left to endure.
People noticed my mental breakdown, which just made it worse.  I couldn't hold it in any longer & I had to embarrass myself in front of them.  My bf noticed shortly after, & by then, I felt like I ruined everyone's night.

It just really sucked.

"event","I know there's a lot of people who wear wristbands to hide their scars from cutting.  I wear it as a constant reminder about who I was & who I am trying to get away from.  It's there to remind me to stop cutting, although it doesn't work all the time.  >.>;;  Well, at any rate, I've been trying to stop.  ^_^  Yay for change, I guess.

Hershey Park yesterday was loads of fun.  Hanging out with a bunch of friends & just letting loose at a day in the park should be done more often.

Anyways...on to my self-improvementness!  I need to seriously work on a lot of things to become a better person.  >.>;;;

I found ""Genshiken 2"" today!  FINALLY the second season came out.  *My Otakuness will never die!*

I'm so ADD today...

Oh well!  I'm going to Hershey Park tomorrow.  That'll be fun.

Anyways, I hope LiveJournal is more popular than I think, but oh well.

"event","Happy new year to all those i haven't bothered to say it to (everyone).

As some of you may have noticed my site is down now and will likely be staying that way. So for the timebeing my domain is going to be redirected and myspace will become my One Stop Jade Shop. I will probably move all my blogging activity to myspace too (so for those reading this on LJ thats www.myspace.com/jadedred, i just dont have time for two anymore). Hence i have started my pretty new myspace layout, funky huh. I'm going to keep adjusting it til it covers all my needs but let me know if you have any reccomendations. Oh and add me to that friend watching thingey, i'm dead interesting me.

Now for the actual life of Jade stuff.
New years was rather manic, never having actually been out on New years (friends and family homes excepted) i decided to venture into the city to Kings College SU where Toby was DJing. The trains we're fine but the roads were blocked off so had a little trouble getting in without at ticket (i was on the guestlist). Decided to avoid a 'Do you know who i am!' tantrum a la the hoff and see if they we're more lax at the other end of the road. They were. Much drinking ensued. New years came with a view of fireworks over the Thames. New years went just as quickly. Much drinking ensued.

By 4am my feet were unbearably painful thanks to my brand new stilleto boots, so i hobbled along embankment with Toby, half the time bare foot on the damp, freezing, dirty pavement. It was almost completely abandoned, a strange sight in London.

Eventually, even with my snail's pace, we got to Fenchurch Street (where Ally, Emily and Amy had already beaten us to). The station didn't open til 6 and the first train wasn't until 6:40 so we waited outside with the rest of the drunks and partygoers, curling up on window sills or napping in doorways.

Got back at 8 and after picking hte glass out of my feet have been pretty much sleeping ever since :D"

Andrew and Toby both popped round for visits which cheered me up from quite a crappy mood. Must remember to take medication.

I meant to get my hair cut and dyed for new years but didn't feel up to it so it will have to wait til the new year. Might spend the day preening and buying new clothes tomorrow to cheer myself up instead.

New myspace ever so slightly nearer completion.

And now a relaxing bath and some diary planning and book reading.

Night night everyone."

Managed to wake up at 2pm today, that has to be a record for this week, stoopid fucked up body clock. Plans to lay in bed unwashed and in pyjamas for rest of day we're ruined by my dad coming round to drop of my Xmas presents. Got an Ipod dock which is lush. Talked my dad in to taking my no longer working Ipod back to the shop to replace it (conveniently neglected to mention my washing it in with the darks). They took it back no problem but only had white in stock so made my dad do a run around til we got a nice shiny black one. Threw in a slick leather case as well, sweet.

Went back with him to my nans where he's staying, had usual family talkies, slagged off my stepmother, got moaned at for smoking nan's cigarettes.

Have decided to take a new attitude to the housework, which even though i have been doing it continously for weeks now does not seem to be making the house any cleaner. If i do one room, one load of washing and one bowl of washing up a day i'm bound to stay on top of it, right? Here's hoping.

Am working on the new myspace page to replace the site, any requests?

I have decided that from now on the website is unlikely to recieve any more updates and once the hosting runs out i will take it down all together, i just dont have the time to pay it the attention it deserves anymore. Instead i will probably replace it with my myspace and use my live journal to keep you all up to date.

Speaking of up to date here are some photos from the weekend....

"event","Been all around the town centre today trying to find someone to give me a student bank account and have been turned down by almost every single bank for various reasons from credit score to not having suitable ID (no i dont have a full driving licence, i dont want a full driving licence and i'm not going to get one just so i can open a bloody bank account). Even the places that have already given me a bank account wont give me one, some even tell me i'm eligible for a credit card but not a student acount *rolls eyes*. So i tried online to see if i could get one in the virtual world, computers are smarter than people.

For everyones information i'm thinking of taking down the site around the end of the year, although i'm still modelling i dont have the time to keep it up to date anymore. I'm considering keeping the domain name and just pointing it here or to my myspace or something like that. Would have to find somewhere to put my non work safe pics though as myspace sure as hell wont host them.

On the modelling front i've just completed another great shoot with Hywel and Chanta Rose for www.restrainedelegance.com. So if you want to see me bound and bitchslapped by Chanta check the Restrained Elegance site for updates (they're not there yet....). I love my job :D

I'm not online much at all anymore so anyone who hasn't recieved answers to emails please be patient with me, i will get round to it.

In fact i'm off to do some more uni work now so heres a picture from one of my restrained elegance sets to whet your appetites.

I'm so tired, 6 o clock in the morning is when you should be going to bed, not getting up!

It was quite cool, a bit boring as its all inductions for the first week but i've met some people and found the student bar :D Still haven't worked out how to enrol yet though :/

I totally intended to drag myself to London today and do my college homework but i just couldn't be bothered after that breakfast. Plus i have like no money, oops.

So what has happened since i last posted? Erm, last weekend i went to Daryl's work charity open day thing and saw cars, ate hamburgers, the usual. When i got back the council had changed my locks! Turns out the fire alarm had been going off so they broke in yanked it out and changed the locks. Pain in my arse.

Posed for my first life class on Tuesday. Fun but very painful.

Spoke to Sean about doing some fetishy shoots, got a few ideas but if anyone else has any they'd like to see me in leave a message ;)

Aside from that my mum went on holiday and my sister gave me a steak.

But it has yet to erupt in to a full blown tonsilitis case so i'm just trying to wait for it to pass. Every time it gets a little better i end up going out, drinking too much and smoking too much and making it worse again. I am such a moron. I'm lonely too, i need someone to play nursemaid, lol.
Must stop treating body like a trash can.

Had a shoot with Chris (misterdigital) up in Worksop again which was fun. Realised i STILL haven't put up the pictures from our first shoot last year so those are coming next, keep a look out. Met some guys on the way back from the shoot and went clubbing in London. Ended up sleeping on someone's landing in Soho. Random.

Life has been an odd mix of lazy and hectic. I went down to Cambridge last week to visit Will, supposedly to shoot with his new lights and to work on onemetal, but the weather was good so most of the time was spent laying outside drinking. It was fun, so much fun in fact i didn't go to work on Saturday, when i rang my boss she just swore down the phone at me and hung up so i guess i'm handing my notice in. Its a massive relief though, that plays was getting me really down and i've been there two years now which is a personal record for holding down a job. Aside from working with Will i haven't modelled in ages, things are slooooow.

Managed to drag Toby to the supermarket afterwards to get some shopping so i can eat real food this week, yay! Had another TV night, in the end i was so tired i just went to sleep and let him watch cricket.

Had to get out of the house today so Luke and I went down to Grays Riverside Park to sit in the sun and play crazy golf. Grays' crazy golf is particularly crazy as the green stuff is all lumpy, there are leaves and stuff everywhere, some of the tees have come away from the floor and some of the contraptions are broken inside so you lose your ball if you hit it in. Turns out its free though so cant complain.

On the other hand i think a jug is just so much more convenient for someone as clumsy as me, i can hold the handle with one hand and use the other for necessary spoon work, a jug the safe way to eat cereal in bed.

I've been working so much lately i haven't had the time to shop so cereal is all i'm managing at the moment. On the way home from the supermarket i heard someone shout 'Stop, Police', so i turned round thinking 'what's going on now' just to see some guy speeding past me being chased by police and half the Morrison's supermarket staff. God bless grays, where daylight shopping becomes dangerous.

Man i'm so tired but i have a shoot tomorrow and stuff to sort out.

I ended up ill again over the weekend, the usual abdominal pain. Spent 4 goddamn hours in A&E (mostly waiting) but i have to go back for an ultrasound (which was closed for easter apparently). Every time i go back they tell me yet another thing i dont have, of course they have no idea what i do have, damnit.

Many things have occured since i last spoke to you from my the online pages of my journal. Most of them the usual day to day stuff with a few quirks in between.

Toby managed to get some tickets to see Razorlight in Exeter so we drove aaalll the way up there but we only hung around for about an hour. I thought they we're okay but Toby wasn't that impressed so we left before we even got to use our aftershow passes. The van broke down 3 times on the way back so we got in at six am, it was knackering! Apparently Toby was hallucinating from the tiredness.

Had a couple of shoots but nothing really worth writing about, just tuition nights and such.

For everyone who is interested my test shoot photos are up on RestrainedElegance.com now so get on there and vote for me!

Have decided i am definately going back to uni, unfortunately i found out they no longer run my course so i'm going to be doing a full time foundation degree in Textiles with Fashion. Really nervous, its going to be a lot of hard work and we all now how bad i am with hard work, organisation, all that important stuff. I'm going to be a UEL student, wooh, i should have my interview soon although apparently thats just a formality since they already know me.

Done a few shoots with some great pictures to come. Also did a mega fun bondage shoot for <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.restrainedelegance.com"">RestrainedElegance.com</a> for their Bondage X Factor, a great site definately worth checking out. Here are some sneak previews :

Sooo, i've not really been doing much, working, spending time with the family, thinking about how much i need to get laid, watching 'Two Pints of Lager', working on photo sets. Got another set to go up soon, nudey, oily fun with chains.

Nah thats all i can manage, go here instead...

"event","Afternoon everyone :)

Have a shoot later tonight with Sean Buckley which i should be getting ready for but i'm so cold i just want to curl up on the bed next to the heater for a while. I attempted to get up at a reasonable hour this morning by taking a sleeping pill to get me off to sleep last night, the last thing i remember is thinking i'm on not tired and the next thing i know its 8 in the morning. Unfortunately one look out the window showed plenty of snowy whiteness, so i jumped in bed for another couple of hours warmness :)

I updated the site the other day with some new shots so if you haven't already check them out under the folder marked Bezza...

Aside from that its been all pretty humdrum round here, need to get used to working again, i keep forgetting to eat around my schedule then end up eating junk when i get to work.

Bye Bye"

I promise to keep this up to date as much as possible. Even if most of it is drivel.

For those who knew i was ill over the christmas period i am feeling much better now and am back on top form, actually im feeling better than before.

And i finally, finally got a new washing machine, looking back through my old journal i realise i wrote a post about it breaking down over a year ago! No more long trips to the laundrette, no more dragging bags and baskets to my mums/dads/nans/whoever will let me abuse their washing facilities, wahey. So sorry Dan, the naturism option is now out.

On the downside i walked in halfway through the first use and realised i had a two for one deal, buy a washing machine get a kitchen based swimming pool, doh! Turns out the pipe that my dad said would hold till tomorrow, wouldn't. But whats another load of towels now, eh.

I'm back to work now and back to modelling this week, have used the time to sort out muchos gallery updates so look out for them (check out <a href=http://www.jadedred.com/forum target=""_blank"">My Forum</a> for more info and preview pics).

Thats it for now guys, be good."

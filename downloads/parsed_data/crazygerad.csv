"event","Yesterday was the change of digital signal. In the United States it was like, we already had both signals going for a while. We don't really give a shit. But noooooooooooooo, we are Puerto Ricans. Some channels left it to the last minute and on top of it all did parties for it.

In one channel it felt like new years. In another they showed a history of the channel which was cool since I remembered some of the stuff. And one of the oldest reporters went and pushed a button on a computer and cried. In another they had to change a really huge elbow shaped switch from one position to another. Which scared me because it should be a computer like the other channel.

I love Puerto Rico but it is just a really tech change, from one format to another. NOTHING to do such an spectacle about. 

If it were like this everytime I deployed an application I would be pretty popular, jajajajajajaja."

"event","Well just last week my xbox arrived. It is working fine but thanks to the stupid UPS and they issues with addresses was that it didn't arrive sooner. Also I bought a PS3 with 80 gigs that has backward compatibility that will now become scarce as Sony announced in some way or the other that it will be discontinued.

Still I am pissed off at the decision of the PS3 to only allocate one 10GB partition to the one of the OSs, it is stupid, why not make it a slider that moved from 10 GB to 10GB. I was going to give it 20 Gigs and nothing more. Still I dunno how much will be my media usage. The other thing I was thinking of is using a HD that I have in an enclosure and install Yellow Dog There. Lets see how the much GB space I will get left once it installs. I hope there is a way to control it remotedly so I can use my main comp mouse and keyboard. I will tell you how it goes.

As for work, having issues trying to predict the future and do miracles for things to work but that is same old same old.

I haven't seen the Batman movie but everyone is giving me a fever to do so. Also next weekend I will go to the DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. My coworkers say I will not have fun since I don't drink alcohol. But I hope to spend most of the time doing something :) so I come home beat. I am going to see about the XBox live to play some Halo or something."

"event","It's very good and I loved it. It moves a lot on the cute side of things but it has a hidden message that jumps out at our current culture and where are we going to. Don't expect as much action as there was in Rattatoie because here there are different themes explored. When it comes out, it is a must buy.

Well as for me, my semi-loaned x-box got the three rings of death. I sent it to the repair center but it seems the status actualization is not too good. Been playing PS2 and PSP games I got to finish. I finally figured the answer to a puzzle in WA5 that had me stuck at one of the towers.

Also I have been looking for a PS3 60 gigs or higher because I want backward compatibility but they are nowhere to be found. I looked in ebay and Amazon but 300+ for a machine that may not have any type of guarantee. Not forgetting the shipping may take the same amount as if it arrived in August where supposedly the new 80 Gig units will come.

I finished Crisis Core after 35 hours, because I did some of the side quests. The game is fun and a very good improvement over Dirge of Cerberus. Personally, I would have loved that the side quests would have led to meeting more obscures characters of FF7 like Helena and whoever we don't get to see often. Still the game's ending leaves some loosened plot points so it seems that a FF7 remake is quite possible. It is sure I would buy it."

I was given the problems and a I saw them. Had no idea and the pain got bigger. I had to leave to go to the bathroom and once that was solved. I saw one of the papers and thought, ""hmm, I think I can solve this with a circular algorithm"". I started to work on it with two hours left. Changed midway to recursion instead of iterations since I couldn't think of a way to go about it. 

When I finished and ran it. Boom, had to save the text file as "".in"". Then none of the boards it could find a solution for. I checked and rechecked, the code was fine. It is what I think it should do.  I had to hand it in like that since I didn't had any time left to debug it but I am still curious as to where I went wrong.

Still considering the many setbacks, including that I have not solved things like this in years. I am quite pleased with second place. It could have been worse and I did my best.

<lj-cut text=""The name of the Rose"">
The first is a murder mystery in a convent its sort of like a Franciscan Sherlock Holmes. You never know whats going on and the whole existentialist questions make it fun.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Flatliners"">
Flatliners is about a group of doctors who medically kill themselves and revive for them to experience death but when they come back they bring something with them.
</lj-cut>

And also I learned that I made a mistake in buying Days of Defeat Source. Since it is a multiplayer game and I wanted to play alone in order to practice for when I had an FPS battle with my coworkers. It was at 27 USD at the store and on the net using the lame Steam prog (which is a pain to install) it was at 10 USD. I wish the error message was ""I couldn't connect to server"" not ""I cant load steam.dll"". After two hours of installing and downloading some jerks tell me to F10. That is the new Alt-F4 for this type of game. Oh well one learns from everything I suppose. At least people in Gunbound were jerks for free.

I was told of a few games Battlefield 1942 or I could try the previous call of duty. Its not like I am a good fps gamer something cheap and friendly will do. I am trying not to succumb to buying a 360 and the Wii is harder to find than good jokes to make in here. Super Mario Galaxy looks cool. Resist the urge. Stupid dark side."

Today my boss asked me in a reunion with everybody if I was dealing with this woman from this floor. I looked amazed at him: ""What?"" I though he want I was romantically dealing with her or whatever. He then told me: ""Yes or no"". I was thinking that I didn't directly work with her for long. After a while of dodging the question he finally told me that she was an acidic and difficult person when it came to us bothering her system and that she spoke well of me in dealing with this new system. I was relieved while everybody else laughed.

Thankfully today was slow since the boss is implementing a new development system and he has us with reunions everyday and supervising too much.

So today I went to house expo where sellers from construction to mortgage loans showed up their stuff. The models or women at many booths where good looking althought since I have no house of my own nor desire to fix or improve my mother's house. I have no value as a customer. Still one both was giving a free tarot reading to a reknown witch. Don't know if she is a real witch. We signed up and did some things while we waited. List was pretty long. 

After all the waiting it was my mother's turn. She told her that everything was fine and dandy that I would be successful, prosperous (thumbs up) and generous. When it was my turn I was told I am a very intelligent, seldom understood, a loner that chooses the few friends he has. All things that I know and I accept about myself. Then she told me I would be naive with women. *checks definition for naive* Well I do believe its possible for the world societies to improve and all that. Well it may be true. I doubt it will happen but its possible. And last she told me I would marry in 10 years when I am 35 which is wrong since I am currently 24 but whatever. That part I didn't like much. Considering the void in my living room where girlfriends throphies are supposed to be, I don't doubt this could happen. I wonder if there is a dating-for-inept-idiots-that-couldn't-get-a-date-even-if -threatened book. I hope there is at least some try-out relationships before then if not I am really screwed and will have a ""40-old Year Virgin"" movie modeled after me. Well nobody said I had to be perfect.

Continued my issue with the finances and then they come to my mother. ""Maybe they are current or ex-alumni?"". I take a few steps back. ""WTF?"" They hug my mother and next I know they are coming to me all I can hear ""don't worry he is my son you can hug him too"". Confused I hugged them, I wasn't going to refuse these good-decent looking women. One of them says-""love and peace"". ""Lots of love"" I replied  still out of it. This swarm of women leave me walking away. ""He is single and has a good job"". I look at my mother distraught: ""I don't know what just happened but even guys like me can have their lucky day"". Sadly there no photos were taken as proof of this unlikely to happen again event.

We had met a young guy earlier saying: ""I am a young person the lives life with excellence"". He was very nervous and did it badly. I can identify with him, if I was made to do that I would do the same or worse. Seems there is this church called ""Peace for ..."" that goes to the mall hugging people and wishing peace and happiness to everybody. Most probably the guy got hooked in by the bountiful gals only to find out this is some promo to work promoting peace and love with no more women religious love.

I am very cool with the idea, because you cheer up other people. Sadly in this materialistic and superficial world I wouldn't have been as happy if they were old ugly women or if it was my yet to exist daughter and I can imagine their jealous boyfriends. But hey, at least it made my day."

Also I am coding in Perl which I dislike because you can do one thing in a thousand different ways and I just got to test around from time to time which way gives me the result I want. It has been a cool enlightening experience for me though. After i finish this I am supposed to work with PHP so if anybody has any tips I should look out for like avoid SQL Injection attack (In a query or insert an attacker maliciously adds his own query to execute).

In terms of my life I have met a couple of chicks but no luck with them. I'll keep trying. Last August was the anniversary from starting at my current job.

In terms of gaming and movies:
<lj-cut text=""Wild Arms 5 review"">
I bought Wild Arms 5 sadly it didn't came with the booklet and the extras since I pre-ordered it. Seems PR or that store wasn't didn't get it. Taking that aside the game is very cool but I am biased since I am a fan of the series. 

The story so far its usual fare, you got an hyperactive main character, a hot female friend and a hot female friend that came from the sky and has amnesia. If I had gotten a thousand dollars every time the amnesia angle was used I would be rich. Hopefully there will be plot points and so forth. 

As for game play the world map feels more realistic, taking out the overhead view now Filgaia is divided in four bigger sections. Everything looks scaled to size and now towns and dungeons can be seen without searching them. Sadly the search system still exists to get items. There is an annoyance with this, every time you search Dean(the main characters) yells something and if you are combing the place its annoying. Thankfully there is an option called voices you set to custom and shut Dean the hell up until you finish searching. 

Battles are like the fourth game with the hex grid, magic is still done with equipped mediums that give you certain abilities depending on the level you are on and points you want to temporally spend. This time around everybody got an ARM and you have limited shots until you need to guard and reload. Even if your weapon is not some kind of projectile or a sword. Beats me as to the reason. This system gives more of a tactical approach since you got to think where to move your characters and how to avoid they getting hammered by the nearby enemies. The vitality gauge is thankfully gone and now you just replenish hp after each battle. This doesn't take away difficulty because the enemies can wipe you out in fewer shots. Random battles can be switched off if you defeat the Sol Nigger like in the fourth game.

For tools it was simplified to just Dean on showing and his gun switching to different kind of bullets that do different things. So far I just got the standard bullet.

Overall I am very much liking the game and hooked to playing it. Still that doesn't help the games I got unfinished.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Bridge to Terabithia"">
As for movies I saw Bridge to Terabithia. The trailers do trick you into thinking the movie is sort of like Narnia but that is not true. In short it is a drama of growing up and the tragedies that come with it. The main characters life really sucks in our time that kind of thing would be reason for a kid doing a mass massacre at their school or suiciding. They just escape to an imaginary world they made for themselves. Its a cute story with a couple of tears but I didn't feel that thrilled to having watched it.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Norbit"">
I saw Norbit it was cool being the best part when the fat woman got on the slide but I didn't laugh as much as I did with ""The Nutty Professor"". Maybe because my weight is in the middle range I didn't identify as much or something. I say this because I got a coworker that is fat and she enjoyed it a lot. Its watchable though.

So its already August and I haven't managed to do a lot of things from this year's to-do list. I have a few ideas for stories but not enough creativity to make them decent. Programming turn thoughts into functions. And that many PS2 games I am interested are now in 20 USD or less is hardly helping. Got about 10 games in backlog. I really doubt I would be buying any of the next gen consoles in a couple of years at this rate.

Yesterday I came to work and as usual this coworker was early and already working. He was preparing to go to a presentation for one of our projects. He even brought his lunch food, took the in-focus and whatever he needed. I saw him go and sat to work. 

At 1pm the client calls us saying the guy is a no show. We try to call him but the phone isn't answered. We think the guy was kidnapped, in a crash or something. We even call the nearest hospital and his mother. Nobody knows to which pit of hell he disappeared to. So we keep calling and we text the guy: ""Dude, we are worried about you. Call us."" We receive a reply: ""Don't worry about me"". We thought it was another person that stole his cellphone and keep trying to get out more info. He says he is in his home. We call again and his mother says he isn't so we keep trying and trying until he tells us that he quits.

All of us looked around to each other. A responsible person like him, quitting like this is not possible. The guy was a sort of programming supervisor, never had any problems with any of us and he never seemed bothered. It can't be true. So we check the conference room and there it was everything he took in the morning and all his keycards and so forth. Yes, it is true. He seems to have returned about 11am, when we heard the door but didn't pay too much attention to it since it is a little far and out of view.

The guy left those clients hanging making the company look bad. He had projects only he understood. He just left like that. We kept on trying to find out more and his reason for quitting was that he didn't want to be a supervisor nor take on the responsibilities of another coworker who quit last week. That he almost ended at the client but decided to come back leave everything and just quit.

All of us were left speechless not being able to understand how someone like him could do something like this. He was responsible, dependable, a good coworker that knew about a lot of things. Of the software developers he had the best salary even from the start. We all got along peachy and if you needed to tell something you can be as honest as you want to our bosses. If you felt pressured and couldn't do something you could talk it out.

Today, we talk to the guy and he says we overreacted. He didn't thought anything like this would happen. All of us are really pissed off, no goodbye, no letter of resignation, just a coward running with his tail between his legs for some stupid presentation. I talked to him on messenger and told him to go to a psychiatrist. The guy still doesn't realize the screwup he just did. I am not going to waste more energy since clearly its not worth it.

If you are going to quit a job, it is customary to hand in a resignation letter and give some time for your employers to find a replacement. The more specialized a position is, the more time you got to give. Just to do it as an act of good faith and you never know when you might meet one of your coworkers at another job, and its their decision to hire you.

"event","I was watching a CNN article on why gasoline is so high prices and the alternatives. In one part they talk about how in Brazil they have a very low to non-existent dependency of foreign oil because they have been using ethanol for 20+ years. They have cars called ""FLEX"" that means they can run on gasoline as well on ethanol. Can't find a station, don't worry any gas one will do. This technology has been used for 8 years. Considering it has been in play from such a long time, all the kinks must have been worked out and it is practically a standard.

I ask an Internet Brazilian friend about it and what he tells me is this. It is true it has been 20+ years and the cars have almost been standardized to being flex. The cost at the pump is about half and it has 80% efficiency of gasoline. Cars are a little overpriced than their gas-only counterparts. The cheapest models are now flex so it is possible to buy one more than a Prius. Model that doesn't go down from 25k and the battery may bust after eight years. There are also models coming with fart-power(methane)included.

He tells me that it is produced from sugar cane and you can have both sugar and this oil. It is easier to make than corn. So my questions are this: Why is the US  so fixated on corn? Why not learn from the experts instead of reinventing the wheel? Most probably it is to keep getting the Arabs and homegrown oil producers rich. Also considering that corn is so inefficient at producing ethanol it will patch the gas price problem long enough for people to think its pure crap and submitting to their addicted gas fate.

Until either politicians seek the experts or the people make them seek professional help: ""Silly North Americans, cheap power is not for you""

I will try to seek more info on this issue and tell you if I find anything else.

---------------------------------
On other news I saw the movie ""Mr.Brooks"". It is about this upscale boring, loving family guy that has the addiction to murder. There is a detective on the lookout for him that has her own problems to deal with and third parties that convolute each of their lives. 

What I liked about it is that it takes this type of story to the level of drama. Each character has their internal and external issues and their story is believable. This isn't an  unrealistic psycho that toys with his victims in the most horrible of ways. You are not subject to watching a sadomasochist wet dream like in Hostel, Saw, Hannibal and so many more. Sadly, this has a downside. It made the movie somewhat slow, long and a bit predictable at times.

If you like thrillers, watch this move it is really good and you won't regret the money spent."

In terms of content it was a lot of action figures, some manga pocket novels and a lot of anime movies. I bought a live action devil man movie that had some cool CGI scenes. Also there are some pretty hot women in the geek sector, too bad most of them were under 18.

I really hope that if I ever get to one the *cons you talk about it is much better than this one. Suffocating to death in a basketball court and feeling cramped isn't my thing.

"event","My long quest to install a DVR for the cameras is coming to an end. First I searched high and low,  without installing DVRs go from 600 to 1500. Some with only one camera some others with four. The company that we pay for our security surveillance told us an industry grade system with four cameras is 1700 USD. And lets not forget the stupid Sales tax. 

So I kept searching and found one in Sam's club at 307 USD without sales tax. ""Woo hoo"", I said to myself. It is half price or more compared to the others but I still not had the money to buy it.  There was another issue, BNC female plugs behind the DVR. I already own two cheap 40 USD each video cameras that output to RCA. Another quest to find a RCA to BNC connector.

After my long search I found that I was doing it all wrong. Because first I thought BNC was antenna but no, it is not. Also I though the RCA was supposed to be male but no it is female. So what I was really looking for, after I gave some thought, is a RCA female to BNC male connector. I  look in Puerto Rico and stores don't know what I am talking about. I look the majestic internet and there they are, 2 USD each plus 1.50 USD for shipping and handling each. I bought four just in case but they still will take some time to arrive. 

So today I wandered into a Radio Shack and strongly asked for the connector and the guy had it. Cool, now I can test if it really works or not. If I am wasting my money on the whole thing? At home I connected everything and I committed an error. The out to the TV or whatever is a BNC plug too. Damn it! I thought: ""Well, I only need to see if it works for out and if it does then it will work in"". So I used the plug I bought and connected it to the TV. Eureka! It works. Then I configured what I needed from the DVR setup and it is a pain doing so at its side with the buttons. No control whatsoever. After that I turned it off and changed the connector and plugged  one of the cameras. Pressed record and the lights magically light up much to my happiness. Still it will end when I receive the other connectors. 

My only complaint is that, it is in my room(can't move it as it is now). The hard drive and the fan are a little noisy. The magical lights could bother me when I am sleeping. And it weights some pounds so I will have to move it somewhere else in my room.

Still for those of you that want to install a security system. There are a lot of equipment on the internet, inform yourself to what there is on the market and how does it match to your needs. For example, the two cameras that I got now, 40 USD each, only see around 20 feet and in darkness around 10. There are others that can see farther, can survive the elements and so forth but they cost more. 

For the wireless ones I looked and I looked but found very few models. Problem with them is the electricity. If you want a battery powered one, it only lasts for seven hours. I couldn't find one that is wireless but the cameras plug to whatever power supply can be provided. 

You can find about the DVR on www.cloverusa.com. Mine has four channels, can hold up to an IDE HD of 400Gigs, can connect to the internet and it has motion capture, alarm sensor. It is at an excellent price and does everything."

In this movie the king croaks and Shrek is to be king. Shrek obviously is not amused by the idea so he goes on a quest to get the other one, Arthur, who could inherit the throne. Prince Charming has other plans of course.

In short this movie seems to have been made as some sort of collage project. The story seemed to be a remake of the first movie containing the same motto of ""What is inside is what counts"". Only scratched the surface of the issues presented and never had any memorable moment. For example in the first movie the whole idea of the ogre and everything was fresh. In the second movie there were cool scenes like the factory and the American Idol spoof. And the third only had sexual innuendo about being a father.

On the last comment I really wonder what they were thinking. Shrek is a series that I think is aimed towards kids and the adults who know what the referenced stories are about. In this one only the adults laughed at the jokes and there were a lot of dialogs that hinted toward sexual things. For example the bit about bees and the swear words hidden by a horn. The high school/university part is something that kids will surely not understand. 

To not bore you anymore the movie can be watched but I wouldn't bring the kids.
</lj-cut>

On other notes, I wish to ask, why is there so much hatred toward the anime Tsukihime? I watched all the episodes and I like the story. Its like a darker ""Oh! My Goddess"". I managed to understand most of the plot even the unexplained issues. It moves a little slow sometimes and the balance between dark and light is out of proportion because there is action at the start and at the end but in the middle its mostly drama. 

Also I fail to see why it is associated with goths and emos. It has a sort of depressing thing  but there is hope at the end of the tunnel and people can get over their trials.

At least for me, it goes into the keep for a long time section :)."

"event","Happy Birthday to me! :)

First, I will try to participate in a story contest but I will need to do some research first as it is a one page gig at double space which gives little space to do anything too deep.

Before yesterday, I was working talking with the coworker about the project and I hear: ""George, .... your sister"". I turn around and I look at a fat man with a red and white checkered box. I ask myself, ""Why? What? Is that a cake? Who sent it to me?"" The guy feeling out of place and realizing I was very lost called my sister and put her on his phone for me to speak to her. ""Brother, Happy Birthday!"" I muttered: ""Eh, Thank you"" I looked at the guy's shirt that read the name of my sister's company and I understood. Cake is for me because of my Birthday. Fat man delivered it because my sister sent him to do it. 

Then everyone went to the office kitchen to eat the cake and I told the guy if he wanted to eat some too and he said: ""No, I am watching the waist line"". I dismissed the comment as no and continued on my way completely ignoring him. Later on, he complained to my sister about that.,

Yesterday, I was given spa treatment since I asked for a massage for my aching back. It was a pedicure, manicure, facial and massage. I felt really awkward in the whole process but it was cool. My feet are now smooth since they sort of wax them, and it tickles too. Also I had a white stain on my nails and it was gone. The manicure was more boring. Later I was given the massage, he was using the Swedish system. Its interesting because your limbs, back and torso are massaged . The guy was very respectful and it felt good. I still have back pain but it is a less intense.  What my sister said is true, they do leave you in underwear for it with a towel on. 

Next was the facial, I was wearing a spa robe from earlier.  I asked if I should change to the woman but she said to stay like I was. She was strangely happy about it though. She made me lie down on a bed and there asked me to close my eyes. There she puts a lot of strange stuff on my face. And left me for some time. By this time I was getting hungry and impatient. I felt I was being forgotten. After a while she came back, put some more on my face and told me it was clean and looked good. I was happy no woman has said that to me before. Recommended me a soap for some ingrown beard hair that she says its not acne.

It was a cool experience. Still very expensive if i had paid for that myself. Considering it is a four hour and a half process I consider it is reasonable."

Also I have been buying some games I really don't have the time to play. I just finished Atelier Iris 2 which is a pretty good game if you want to kill some time and not have to deal with a complex plot. It is more of the same, you have a few laughs here and there but nothing too surprising. Still compared with the first it is a lot easier to play and you don't have to collect as many items or harvest mana elements to make stuff.

A coworker has viced me with Rise of The Nations Gold edition which I bought because it was only 15 bucks in Amazon. The game is the same standard fare of gather resources build troops and attack the enemy. Still it is difficult because you got to upgrade a lot of things and if you don't the enemy can overrun you by your lack of resources. Also if you set the difficulty to moderate you will spend a while trying to win a battle considering the continuous squads of enemies that force you to defend. Overall it is entertaining and it has more features I haven't discussed here but for 15 bucks it was a good buy.

On other news, Youtube is a great thing, I could find a video on ICO's gameplay and the ending video. Also there are movies of the original Front Mission game and FM5 that sadly didn't come to the states. 

Well until next time, and I am sorry my writing hasn't improved."

I was making fun of him since his name is his father's spelled backwards and he didn't want to come out of the womb. The doctor was pretty rushed to finish his deliveries before his X-mas vacation so he motivated the kid to come out with some ointments and medicines. The kid stayed firm saying: ""Hell no, I will not come out this pool is nice and cozy"". The doctor watching the watch said: ""You don't want to come out? YOU DON'T WANT TO COME OUT? Fine, I WILL get you out"". So he just cut the place and took the baby out. Obviously this is not how it happened :P.

"event","These last two days I have been playing Family Guy. Its a fun easy game not something for hardcore gamers but if you feel like having fun and not have to exert too much brain mass this game is for you. I say this because mostly it's pretty easy and there is an auto save feature that when you lose just sends you there not having to redo the whole level again. Only Brian's scenario seems to be the hardest but with Trial and Error you will eventually get it.
 
Game play comes in three flavors, you got Stewie that is more action/platformer oriented, Brian is sort of like a dumbed down Metal Gear with no fight and all Stealth and Peter is a beat them up. Levels are just repetitions one being more difficult than the last. In the case of Stewie you have to pick power-ups for your weapon rendering it a weapon worthy for Bush to strike Down. Brian can get disguises that help him and you got to avoid ""distractions"" like peeing a tree, drinking a martini or doing the nasty with some dancing models. Still I cant relate how picking a bunch of stuff actually helped his quest at the end. As for Peter you get to use some moves and pick some special moves that are needed since he is a fat-ass that crawls instead of running. Dodging is pretty much nonexistant so just get rid of the bad guys.

My sadness with the game is that it has no replay value, considering there is no alternative difficulty settings nor a score to brag or something. It clocks at 10 hours or less so consider  renting it."

So today I was going to check out <a href=""http://furyouhin.blogspot.com/"">Gods & Ghosts</a> and I find out that its no more. This saddens me since she did a superb job writing and one could understand the pain homeless people go through. In general I would rather help homeless people get a job and reintegrate into society but sadly some are beyond help and once they are criminals I really dont give a shit anymore.

<lj-cut text=""Breast Cancer day its weird that it's on Halloween"">
My mother was talking to me about how she has to buy a pink shirt for the 31th since it is Breast Cancer day. I was telling her that I would be more supportive for prostate cancer day. Still, what color would it be? Anyways, she tells me that in the movie ""Why I wore Lipstick..."" the protagonist goes to a breast-naked bar and she asks one of the dancers if the guys are always hypnotized by their breasts. The dancer agrees and then she feels depressed since she will be left with only one breast and her husband won't love her and so forth. I can imagine the pain she goes through, I suppose its the same when men have one testicle cut off. Still for men its less visible mishap. 

Now women of the world breast cancer is a pain and it hurts and everything but have faith. You may lose a breast but you if you survive you will be able to eat chocolate again and do a lot of things for a while longer. You may feel a void in your chest but your heart still remains so just use it for happiness and if your man bothers too much just kick him in the nuts. Don't worry and be happy.

I am sorry its been a while since I wrote. I need all the practice I can get :p.

So the tittie bar conversation got me thinking about that kind of place. I would find it interesting to visit them at least once in my life to see what the buzz is all about. I know its about naked breasts you crazy people. Still I want to know how I would feel at the whole experience. I would most probably be embarrassed but it would be a fun experience. I have read <lj user=""boobiesbar""> and another about a porno video store employee and the whole curiousity to go is about gone. I am not like any of those evil customers but that is the kind of place I wouldn't go to be judged. Imagine sitting there and in a zombie like state saying ""boobies"" and then thinking: ""Am I too fat? I am such a loser going to a place like this. What will the dancer think of me?"" It's like going to a service desk and have a rude clerk or something. I know the dancers are human beings too and everything but it's not the like of place I would want to be judged. I think a courtroom or a church is a better place for that.

In the end I think too much.

<lj-cut text=""Hermes Trimegistro"">
------

((Really need to organize my thoughts.))

Also I have been reading lately, ""Hermes Trimegistro"" I am still in the first book ""Poimandres"" or divine intelligence. So far its a mixture between some egyptian beliefs with gnostical christianity and Plato duality philosophy. In short the body is two things the soul and the body. The soul is perfect and all intelligent and the body is dumb and lured too much with the passions of mortality. I agree on that part what I dont agree in is that he is very fanatical about God. ""God is perfect, he/she is the only true goodness"" and so forth. I find this contradictory since he is saying God embodies everything then what about the devil, wouldn't God be both things as he is all powerful and so forth. If I find an answer I will post it here. 

Then after some pages I found the paragraph I have liked the most so far. It says that to understand God one must be like God since ""similars understand each other"". In order to understand others I have to imagine their situation and the background to get what this other person is going through. How would one be able to do such a thing for God? What he says is that our soul is the intelligence and is a divine thing part of God, its the part of us that is immortal. So if we said to our soul to go somewhere far away it could do so since God is everywhere and can do it. In order for us to understand God we would have to go be everywhere at once and all the things can do not in body but in our minds. I suppose the way to achieve this is through meditation.

Well that is it for now.

"event","Lately I have been playing Xenosaga 3, thank the heavens I finished it today. It is quite a cool game and it surpassed my expectations but the ending has something I wished trilogies ended. When you play it you will understand what I mean. I hear there was some censoring as it always happens with ported games but it didn't hurt it much. Still it would have been nice to see the White Shirt for Shion up close on the Data option.

I have been working for one to two months now, I lost count since time is going through so fast now. Sadly, my work being near my home will end soon as we will move to another classier place to show off. Seems we are one of the few bussineses actually doing well and the president wants to expand. At least there may be women in the new place considering its a pretty big building so at least that is something good. A forty minute or more commute is what I hate.

So in my work there have been some new employees. One of them wants to get a Million bucks so he can do anything he wants. So there is an inwork proposal to do a video game on the side. Still they got amped out about it but I tried to get them back on the ground since they talked about some really nasty schedules and I told them to think it through well since this type of venture can be quite nasty if taken at the wrong time doing the wrong things. So at least for now it seems things are going easier. I am reading books on the subject but there is a lot to learn. I can make blue screens for now.

Still that got me thinking. What do I want a million for? In the past I said it was to get a lot of cool stuff and all that. Still now I really don't see that making me any happier. Making a million for the sake of making a one is just asking to be a greedy power hungry person in the future. Sure it would be very nice but its not a valid reason. My coworked said he wanted one to live a carefree life and dedicate to his hobbies. My dream is to become a respected writer especially in the areas of creative essays and short stories. Novels have proven bad for my attention span. A million would certainly enable me to achieve that dream. Also making rpgs would be a fun occupation.

Remind me to practice my organized writing, coding and lack of practice is screwing my literal arts. Still I hope you are doing well and have a nice life."

"event","So my new computer is back and alive but one of the stupid HDs died on me. I will send it back for the warranty it looks pretty fine to have recieved any damage. My ram also died on me so if I can buy a better ram this machine will improve on its speed. Although as it is right now it is pretty good.

SO in my work things are all cool and good. Only complaint is that a coworker insists I drink alcohol for which I refuse. I am crazy naturally and I simply dont need alcohol to live my life. Besides its more fun to watch a drunk than be the drunk. The drunk could refute this but most probably he/she wont remember what they did. Also they want to form a group to make a video game. I said I want in but the people organizing the whole thing haven't read much about the subject and thus think it is an overnight thing. I have read the bad side of the whole thing so I told them its better to take it easy and take our time while we learn or relearn (depending on the case) how to do this since its pretty complicated programming. Still I would like to play a passive role considering how nasty this type of project can end in.

Soooooooooo have a good night and I will think of something more ""gnosis"" to write later on."

"event","Its sad really, I think Stewie was the one that shot him down. Still I am glad nobody was on that building. It could have been worse.

So the good news is that my new computer is already here and now working since I had some mishaps. Still reinstalling everything back and all that is quite a chore. Still I am glad to have a tower precious again. I hope this one endures me for long long years :)."

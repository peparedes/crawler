"event","I've found out recently that my desire to write increases when I disregard the idea of posting the results anywhere online. The act of considering which website, blog or feed to post to is uninspiring. If I just take pen to paper, or simply open up notepad I can express myself freely, without hindrance. The result is more authentic, more pure. I'd say that I'd share the results when I'm done, but even that thought takes away from any current appeal. Right now, I'm writing for me."

Nikki and I finally went on our honeymoon. We went camping at Lake Powell, on the Utah-Arizona border. Rather than posting the typical vacation photos, I had something else in mind, and I hope you enjoy it.

"event","I'm not sure why I'm compelled to post this, but I am. I'm coming to terms with some long-standing and  unpleasant personality traits of mine. In this process I've been reminded of my days as the nice guy, as in the ones that finish last, AKA doormats. I've come to realize that the nice guys aren't really nice at all, they are assholes. When I was one of them, I had convinced myself that I deserved to be with particular girls, and that listening to their feelings was enough to convince myself that I really cared about what they wanted. That's not any more a sign of respect than ignoring their feelings altogether. That's pretty misogynistic, frankly, but it's easily excused because it's coming from a ""nice guy"" and often these expectations or feelings are not expressed unless things get ugly. This is the ugly side of the nice guy. If you've been reading this and you've had a particular person in mind and just rejected this explanation outright and haven't given it a second thought, that person is probably in fact a nice person, but not the stereotypical ""nice guy."" If however, you've read this and find yourself recalling examples and thinking of specific cases to prove me wrong about a person, then they are in fact a ""nice guy."" The other unfortunate truth about existing as a ""nice guy"" is the lack of assertiveness. This is the much more obvious fault of this character, and the point that makes a ""nice guy"" worthy of the title ""Doormat"". This is where, almost contradictorily, a ""nice guy"" convinces himself that he doesn't deserve the girl. It's OK to express yourself and say what it is that you want. It's OK to be assertive. It's also likely that you won't get what you want right away, or maybe ever. By the time you really learn to be assertive, what you want may change.

This lack of assertiveness is a part of being the perpetual little sister as well. I can't speak of any other flaws of that role, as I've never been one, but if you are the perpetual little sister, suck it up and go for what you want. If you fail, suck it up again. Chances are good that no one is going to drop into your lap and really see you for you until you actually start to show your true self to the world. At least, that just this asshole's opinion."

Not the occasionally-make-a-sexist-joke-and-be-done kind of bigot, but one that is firmly entrenched in their bigotry, and has no problem blaming all of the world's problems and controversies on women. I was not the person being address in the conversation that was taking place right next to me this morning, but I could not help but overhear such comments as ""Women should have just stayed in the kitchen and let men do all the work"", ""They can't do everything we men can"", ""this civil rights crap is why all these men are gay and queers"" and further clubs in which to assault the mind and spirit.

I was enraged. I could not tolerate to hear any more of this assault on rational thought and equality that I just walked away. I was not apart of the conversation, and joining at this point would have been a mistake that could have resulted in, at the very least, a lost job. It was not for me to hear. Even if it was... if the devil himself had doused himself in gasoline and handed me a match, I would not strike it. That is not how these battles are won.

As ugly as his words are to me, and probably any woman and hopefully most if not all men, it would not be right of me to force my beliefs on him, no matter how justified I'd feel in doing so. He has a right to his beliefs, however ugly they may be to me. I am thankful that he is not in a position of power, and that he has no one that works under him. I have not seen him act on any of his beliefs, and again, for which I am thankful, and he should be as well..."

"event","I woke up this morning to a stray and her 5 kittens walking across my front yard. The cats themselves were quiet. My redundant, four-legged alarm system was not. We tried to catch them by offering a can of tuna, but the kittens were too young to eat solid food, and the mother has been a stray for years and is not about to change her ways. We were able to catch 4 of the kittens before the mother ran off with the other, and we put them in a box with an old towel for comfort and some water. We looked up how to turn them in, but their was some conflicting info online, but eventually we ended up calling animal control. There wasn't anyone on duty in Urbana today, so they took my phone number and said someone will call with info on dropping them off somewhere. Meanwhile, Nikki is getting ready for a business trip that departs at 6PM, and there are a few last minute things we needed to do; go to the store, pick up the company vehicle by 1. Noon, we are in the store picking up some food and milk substitute for kittens so we can feed the cats in Animal control takes too long to get to us and just as we ring up the items, they call. ""We can send someone to your house right now."" Great. We head back home, get the kittens ready and wait around for a little bit... no one shows. 12:30 and we still don't have the company vehicle, but we do have a box of kittens. Fortunately, we have some very helpful neighbors who were willing to keep an eye on the kittens and wait for Animal control. Ok. My car is out of gas, so we had to fill up, and we were out of gas, so we had to get some lunch, after rushing over to pick up the car with 5 minutes to spare. We head back home, and find the neighbors still have our kittens, and haven't seen anyone drive down our street at all. At this point we call the Humane Society, who were more than happy to take them in, and shortly after we drop them off. Nikki is still not packed, laundry is still drying, and we have a meeting with our wedding planner at 3. I get a couple words in near the beginning, and my moment of glory when discussing the photographer, but after that I was content with occupying the planner's two children. They were curious, and energetic, but very quiet and quite sociable. (Meanwhile, as I'm writing this post, the stray mother from this morning just crossed our yard and once again set off the alarm(Our puggles)).

In any case, I spent a good portion of today cuddling quite a bit of small, wiggling beings, and am ending the day with one less cuddly being who will not return for another four days.

One of my coworkers is Cambodian. He was born there, lived in Viet Nam for some time before moving here. He really enjoys spicy food at a level that I also enjoy and we have other common interests as well. So I tend to share with him the experiences that I get that are Asian in nature because I consider him a friend and because I think he'd appreciate it. Today I told him, ""I went to Taiji last night.""

""What did you get?""

I'm puzzled at this point, to say the least. ""What do you mean?""

""What did you get? Did it taste good?""

I hold back a smile as I clarify for him that I went to a martial arts class, and it registers with him what Taiji is. He thought I was talking about a restaurant, which is a common thing for me to bring up, but still didn't quite excuse forgetting what Taiji was. We had quite a few laughs after that, joking about Karate and Kung Fu and which is spicier. So if you are considering going to any martial arts classes in the future, ponder this:

Let me just say that announcing ahead of time the amount of time that a strike is going to last is pretty pointless, especially when that length of time is measured only in days. That's like announcing, ""I'm so upset by this, I'm going to pout for exactly this amount of time and see if I get me way."" I'm sorry, but the point of a strike is not to glorify a tantrum, it is attrition. Cut off their support with no end in sight so greatly that they have no choice but to yield.

"event","Hey guys, let me run an idea past you. I'm starting up a technology blog for those who need a personal guide and an atlas to navigate their way through anything tech. It's a blog for the people who have a hard time setting the clock on their microwaves, programming their universal remotes, using their new iPod, the people in over their heads shopping for entertainment center, or the people who just wish their existing tech could do more for them. What do you think?

I've been reading blogs like engadget and gizmodo lately, but realizing that those sites are great for the geeks who like hearing about new and upcoming products, but not great for actually using any existing stuff. I thought it would be great if there was a tech blog focused on the practical, everyday uses of technology that we've got in our homes. What do you guys think? What suggestions do you have for putting on the blog?

Some of the ideas I had were for info on the analog/digital tv switch coming up next year, instructions on setting up a basic file server at home and why it's a good idea, and maybe even some quizzes guiding people certain products when they aren't sure what they're looking for.

In any case, I've set up accounts at a few different blog sites so far, and have an easy way of sending the same posts to each site(which unfortunately means having ads on the livejournal version). So far, I've got an lj and blogger account set up for this, and a wordpress account that I'm thinking of dropping because I really don't like the features or lack thereof. Any suggestions on other blogging services? I would either need one that could post rss feeds to the main blog(not on the side like some insist on doing), or that allows for email/mobile posting. I don't want to go overboard with accounts, I just want to focus on a few popular ones, or at least those with easy to remember domain names."

Nikki and I had guests this Saturday, and as of Thursday, there was plenty to be done to get the house in order for company. Fortunately, I had this past Friday off from work so I was able to help out. We had most of our shopping done already, and finished most of the cleaning by dinner time Friday, so we decided to take a break, start boiling some eggs for the deviled eggs, and sat down to watch an episode of House. Near the end of the episode we remembered the eggs, but not before they had all broken open. There goes 1 dozen eggs. Ok, no biggie, I'll just run to Aldi in the morning and get some more and still have plenty of time left to make them before people arrive. Next morning, that's exactly what I did. Zoom! I'm back with the eggs. ""I've been trying to call you nonstop! We need brown sugar."" Okie doke, Zoom! I'm back with brown sugar. Things go smooth for a while, and Nikki and I start to wonder if her sister is bringing her dog along or not. A few minutes later, we find out that she did. +1 Chaos. Pups running around everywhere like mad. Anyways, the eggs are safely boiled and ready to be deviled, so Allison gets started on that(That'd be Nikki's sister). Mixing goes ok, and adding the mix back to the whites go great, too. Nikki's mom and step-dad show up, and once again dogs are excited. Within 5 minutes the recently completed deviled eggs are on the floor, and within seconds in the stomachs of the dogs. 5 or 6 were salvaged, and for some reason put in the freezer to be forgotten... 2 dozen eggs in less than 24 hours. Tip: don't freeze deviled eggs.

The rest of the meal preparation and consumption went just fine. We had:
Apricot Glazed Ham
Assorted Mini-Quiches
Steamed Green Beans
Hash-brown Casserole
Assorted Fruits(Grapes, Strawberries, Papaya, Mango, Mini-Bananas, Honeydew)
Croissants
Rice Pudding for dessert

My dad showed up shortly before the meal was ready, and everyone got along quite well, and due to my dad pretending to forget my name, I was called Bob for the remainder of the day. Everyone enjoyed the meal and company, and clean-up was easy and equally sociable. Just as people were migrating away from the table, Nikki's parents go out to there car to finally give us their Christmas present that's been delayed for various reasons and in the process let Audry out front, sans leash. No big deal, she's never run far, and just calling her back in usually works. They open the door to call her back and let Max out, sans leash, to go chasing after Audry, across the street, through the cul-de-sac and through some backyards and out of sight. Ugh. Bye Dad! See you later, got to catch some dogs. Nikki takes off on foot with the leashes, I in my car, and her parents in their car. I start driving towards where I saw them running last, and up the next street. No luck. I drive the next block over and head back. There they are, together, sniffing someone's bushes. I tell Nikki on the phone where I see them and give her an address and hang up so I can call them in without yelling into the phone, apparently just as she was telling me to stay on the line. Oops. Anyways, I call the dogs from where I am and they recognize me and my car, but go back to sniffing. I drive up a little closer and open the car door and call again. Audry comes running and hops right in. Max lingers around for a little longer but eventually runs up and into the car safely. Doors closed, I try to call Nikki back to give her the good news but it doesn't go through(probably because she was trying to call me at the same time). I head back and spot her parents and give them the thumbs up and the number 2, and they follow me home. Once there I finally get a hold of Nikki and fill her in, and stay in the car with the dogs until she arrives with the leashes in her sister's car. Phew. The rest of the evening was much more relaxed and unexciting(thankfully!), and people head home shortly.

Sunday was pretty relaxed for the most part, but right when the Simpsons was starting, the dogs decided they had to go out, and in the process, a stray dog shows up. Naturally, Audry responded by freaking out and yelping maniacally, but in the most calm way, I assure you. I take Audry back inside, and come back out with food to convince the dog to stick around long enough for us to call the police(Nikki's idea). The person on the other end of that phone call was trying to pass the buck and said that Animal Services was off and they could only pick up the dog if it was contained and to call back then. ""Stay on the line, that should only take a minute."" Before he was done taking my information, we had led it into the back yard with the gate closed behind it. We hang out outside with the dog while waiting for the police and the whole time the dog was very calm, and a little friendly. It had a collar, but no tags, and really wasn't interested in the food we had to offer, so we were pretty sure it wasn't a stray. The cops were amused at how good natured it was, and even more amused when the dog tried to jump into the front seat of the squad car. For those of you keeping count, that's 2 dozen wasted eggs, 2 lost dogs, and 3 found.


Anyways, just another quick reminder that I'm going to be at Warsaw Inn around 1PM on the first Saturday of April, and planning on going to Mitsuwa that evening for random shopping and possibly dinner. It's vaguely near Woodfield mall, if I recall. They have a website if you're interested in checking out a Japanese Mini-mall, or just getting a chance to hang out a little longer. Also, at this point I'm curious to know about how many people are planning on going(but not necessarily who). I'd like to hear from the locals who's planning on going, and I'd like to be surprised by any out-of-area guests, if any.

P.S. For those in the know, I still have the bucket from a previous time, though unfortunately, most of the poetry has been removed/made illegible."

After that went slowly, I started buying goofballs from the shady looking guy on the wrong side of the tracks. This only works if you've got a lot of loot to spend, and it sped things up a lot, but cost me over 4Mil to do. I was able to drop 12 levels in a day this way.</lj-cut>"

"event","I just have to  vent a bit about something I've come across somewhat often lately.

When I am considering purchasing something that's not a necessity, or simply going to require some budgeting to acquire, I tend to do a fair amount of research into the product online. I'll read critics' reviews and reviews from users as well. What I have to complain about is the users who will review a product and make it abundantly clear that they had no idea what to expect from the product, or had simply an entirely unrealistic expectation about the product.

For example: a user review of a recent Ani DiFranco album complained about her singing and said that she had nowhere near the talent of Avril Lavigne or Cristina Aguilera, and would never make any charts... aside from pointing out that the latter point is just flat out wrong, regardless of opinion, I'm just going to move on.

Example two: a user review complaining about the picture quality on a new product and going on about how it doesn't display in HD. NEWSFLASH: It never said it supported HD! You may as well complain to your cable provider that you want to cancel your service because the remote doesn't open your garage door or make toast. Ugh. Don't give a product a 2 out of 10 because you didn't know what you were buying, especially when the company has been explicit about the capabilities and limitations of its product.

Ok, I'm done."

Anyways, some good news. Nikki bought Adobe CS3 Web Premium for me through work for only $270, that's less than half the price of Photoshop alone! I'm hoping to teach myself flash, but not expecting anything to happen overnight. I'll probably start by picking apart some Strong Bad emails to understand some of the concepts going on. Anyways, it's nice to have software that isn't going to self-destruct because you inadvertently bought it from a pirate.

That was the first purchase that's being paid for by my business. I haven't got the check from SDI yet, but it should be in my mailbox today. I may even try to drive out to my mailbox for it today(Business mailbox, on the other side of town, unfortunately). I have another relatively small purchase that I plan on making from that money, and the rest is going to pay bills.

I started a new blog, under a name that I've never used before, to make various bits of technology easier to understand. It's brand new, so there's not anything up yet, and there are a few things that I want to set up before I ""announce"" what it is. Strangely enough, I need some help. I signed up at three different blog sites under the same name, and I want to be able to post to all of them at once, and get emailed comments, and be able to reply to comments by email. Does anyone know how to set up any or every part of that? The three sites are livejournal, blogspot, and wordpress. My hopes are that if I'm able to successfully demystify various bits of tech to the public, that I might be able to attract some sponsors in the process. It's an idea, at least."

"event","Listen up folks, because this is valuable information: some of you may know that all television is making a switch over from analog (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC"">NTSC</a>) to digital (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATSC_Standards"">ATSC</a>) in a little over a year from now. This will affect you if:
<ul><li>You don't currently subscribe to Digital Cable/Satellite</li><li>You <b>do</b> currently subscribe to Digital Cable/Satellite and subscribe to local channels, or have a local channel package.</li></ul>The good news is that the Gov' is issuing out <a href=""http://www.ntia.doc.gov/dtvcoupon/index.html"">coupons</a> of $40 each, up to two per family(household) to help pay for the new equipment. You will need either a converter box(similar to a cable box) or a TV set that has a digital (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATSC_Standards"">ATSC</a>) tuner built in. If you already pay for digital service, you have one already and you're all set.

Some potentially bad news is that some of your local channels will be lost for good after the conversion. It's unclear as to how much the broadcasting equipment is going to cost, so some of the small broadcasters may go to the wayside. This is only speculation, but the possibility is there, and it's not the cable companies' fault if these broadcasts disappear, so please don't yell at them if this does happen.

Here's where things get more complicated - <lj-cut text=""Translation: Only read the rest of this if you are a gadget geek."">

If you are planning on purchasing a non-subscription based DVR, be sure that it supports the new <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATSC_Standards"">ATSC</a> standard, otherwise you will have to have additional equipment to decode the new signal. If you're like me, you want very few things cluttering up the entertainment center, so having to buy and set up two piece of equipment to do the job of one is very undesirable. I got started looking into this after looking into the <a href=""http://www.archos.com/products/gen_5/archos_tv/index.html?country=global&amp;lang=en"">Archos TV+</a>, a new DVR with a slew of features(WiFi access to the web and shared folders on the network for streaming vids or music, on-screen channel guide for easy recording, expandable memory with USB port, and more) and no where in the technical specifications did it mention anything about Digital TV signal, whether it supported it or not. After doing some digging I learned that the new digital standard is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATSC_Standards"">ATSC</a> and noticed that the technical specifications only supported <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC"">NTSC</a>, the current analog standard. I like new toys and all, but I want to know that if I spend a couple hundred dollars on them that they will at least be useful beyond a year. Granted, the other features of this particular DVR will still be useful beyond the conversion, but its primary function would be obsolete. Not cool.</lj-cut>

Anyways, take this as a bit of a precaution when purchasing your next piece to go into the entertainment center, and consider yourself better informed."

I know, I probably shouldn't be posting non-committal dates like this. But I'm tempted to come up both weekends, once on my own, and the other with Nikki, not sure if that'll pan out, either, but it's a thought.

I was toying with the idea of taking a vacation day to give me a three day weekend and more time to spend up north for my B-day, but doing so would mean that Nikki wouldn't come up so she could keep an eye on the dogs. If we just come up for a meal then turn around and go back, she's OK with the dogs staying at home."

"event","Sorry this post isn't going to be more specific, what it involves is still in the early ""planning"" stages.

Either the last weekend of March, or the first weekend of April, I will be up in the Round Lake Area. Which ever weekend I decide, on Saturday I will be going to Warsaw Inn for a meal, Lunch at the earliest, or Dinner. For those who aren't familiar with this restaurant, it is a Polish American Buffet. About half of the menu is Polish, and excellent, and the other half is whatever they feel like putting out that day, but it tends to have ""safe bet"" foods like fried chicken, a salad bar or spagetti, all of which is pretty good. Pretty much anyone is welcome. All I ask is that you bring a good attitude. This will be my birthday meal, I'd like for everyone to have a good time. Gifts are not required or encouraged, just showing up would be great.

So here's the other thing: if you don't live in that area, I would rather be in the dark as to if you are showing up or planning to show up. I know it can be kind of a big deal to make a trip that way if you don't live in the area, so I will try and post some concrete details ASAP. Unfortunately, I probably won't be able to commit to anything other than a meal up there, as I will be traveling with Nikki and two dogs(who like chewing on various things when left alone, so they need special arrangements whenever we travel, and one of which currently has special medical needs). If anyone wants to travel out that way during that time and wants more to do in the area than spending one meal with me, talk to someone in the area and see if you can make further plans, as I probably can't be a part of it anyways.

Was that too confusing? I hope not. I'll try to have a specific date and time posted later this week."

Yeah, ok. That was a little dramatic, but in some ways, that's how it felt. Finances were difficult, but just barely manageable. In other ways, this year was fantastic, namely meeting Nikki and everything that has resulted from that. We are still going strong, but not without our difficulties. We always  manage to work things out for the best and each of us grows in the process. It's very cool.

Anyways, I'm very near completion of the project for SDI, should be done this week. The extra money from that will come in good time. I've got a lot on my plate these days, and I'll go into more detail later, but for now, I have work to look forward to tomorrow.

"event","So, it feels like a lot's been happening, but I'm not sure what's news at this point.
I've had my first paying customer for my own business, which in itself makes this more successful than my last business venture. I also have another customer lined up that will be a different line of work than I'm going for, but still falls under my business category, which is computer service. It's a 100-hour project for Steel Dynamics converting a manual to digital format so that it can be easily updated. I'm just doing the transcription, and formatting, they'll do the rest(updating it with current information). I'm charging less than my normal fee, mostly because I have no professional experience with this, and there's not a whole lot of skill involved in this task. Still, it will be a nice check.

Other than my own business, I'm getting to the point where Solo Cup wants to hire me... Let me rephrase that: they want to hire me. It's very close to the point that they can do that without penalty fees to pay to the temp agency, and I'm going to talk it over with the HR rep sometime next week to work out the details. They are planning on tailoring a position to suit my skills, starting from a previous position that hasn't been filled as a point of reference. In the mean time, though, I'm kind of in a limbo position there doing some tasks that no one else wants to do. For the past week and the next week I will be cleaning up the industrial equivalent of a junk drawer(only it's as long as a football field and 1/3 as wide). It's been a little odd though, and in a way it has given me a (temporary) position of authority. I have an assistant who drives a forklift, which wouldn't be necessary except that as long as I'm a temp, I'm not allowed to drive one. It's a new experience to me to be delegating work to someone that I'd normally be doing myself, and given me a small taste of management. I'm fortunate that my assistant has been very cooperative and understanding when my duties require me to walk away from the physical labor and sit at a desk while he works. It's rather humbling, to be honest.

Anyways, on to news that's not directly about me: Nikki bought a new dog. She adopted a puggle from the Humane Society, and we have named her Audry. I haven't taken many pictures of her yet, but I will. She's got a couple of fairly minor medical issues to take care of for now, including worms(not the heart variety), an ear infection and something that's new to me, ""cherry eye."" For those who don't know and can't be bothered to google, Cherry Eye is the condition of having the pink, fleshy part of your eye(the part in the corner) swell up so that it sticks out a little. It's not a ""problem"", really, it won't put her at risk of anything, and they usually fix it when they do another procedure to a dog. Medical concerns aside, she's generally very cheery, and she's a good companion to Max(Nikki's current puggle). Anyways, gotta stop this here as things are needing my attention."

I told him id be there in bout 5 minutes, i pull up looking like a fuckin bum, shorts, shirt and sandals,i left my shyt in the car and went to were the boyz were. We call them out,they back down like little pussies because their gfs were telling them not to fight, one of them said something bout killing and that got my blood boiling. i was like ""yall wanna see a REAL murder weapon?"" fucking pulled out my switchblade. i asked dude ""u kno what this is??""  he replies with ""yeh i kno what that is"" so i said ""what is it then?"" he goes ""a fuckin switchblade"" im like ""wrong, itz ur fucking death. i'll kill ur fuck ass right here in feed u to ur mother, fuck with me"" im suprised he didnt cry after they pussied out,went back to jonathan's house and beat his ass in WWE and in Def Jam:Fight for NY. Then went home. Today, spent about 2 hours fixing up this god damn computer. That's like the 8th time. But i think this is gonna be the last time. Something happened to my dad that now he wants to buy a house in North Carolina,his mother's dying in Massachusetts so he no longer has a reason to go up there after that so it might be North Carolina we move to. I'm all for it, it'd be great to get the fuck outta here,and i wouldnt miss too many ppl either.....

"event","My friends, i still got it. My ex gf, after her pussy ass bf said she was no longer to have any contact with me,called me for a ride last night. So me being nice i picked her up and i ask her for gas money, she says no. So itz fyne, she's already in my car, im not gonna drop her off for not having gas money. She gets on my ass because i supposedly cheated on her. It was a story i made up cuz she said she no longer cared about what i did and shyt, i knew she did. Anywayz,she's calling me and asshole and whatnot after i pick her up to do HER a favor. The whole way home she's calling me an asshole, and saying im heartless and what not, and well frankly, she didnt make it home, cuz i drove about half a mile away into a community under construction, and she starts crying. I park and jus stay there all while she's crying. She calls her mother and then lookit this, she calls her bf and starts talking shyt about me to him in MY car. So whatever her mom came and got her, gave me a 10 minute lecture on putting ppl's lives in jeapordy and that words will be words. So basically, her mom was saying that it was ok for her to call me and asshole even after i was doing her a favor,and that i had all that fault. Itz ok tho,i loved every minute of it."

"event","Today, woke up at 11:30. Kristen picked me up around 12:15. We went to wal-mart so she could do her shopping cuz she was missing alotta shyt at her apartment. After that we went up to Jason's Deli and ate, and that shyt was funny cuz i saw atleast 4 ppl i knew and they kept interuppting us and she was getting mad. Then after that we went to the movies, but the movie started at 4:45. We went to go bother Eddie at k-mart, couldnt find him, so we left. Went to go pay my phone bill and then came back to the movies. We were like the only ones there for like 15 minutes so we jus fucked around. Then ppl started coming in, and i swear it was like the circus was in town. Had a guy that was breathing soo heavy he was literally roaring. Had 2 little kids who snuck into the movie being loud and Kristen was like ""im going to tattle on them"" and they were quite. Then these 2 ppl that worked at the movies came in and watched the movie from the ramp that u walk into the theater,I took my gum outta my mouth and hit one on the head,and then i showed kristen my phone acting like i was showing her a text message and we burst out laughing so they wouldnt kno. One of the kids slipped and fell. We saw the Transporter 2. Fucking awesome movie. After that i went back to her house for a bit and then i came home. It was a pretty good day. It was FUN.

In other news: me? having fun?? cant be. according to my ex gf im angry at life. Why am i angry at her u ask? well, i shall tell u. After we broke up she got over me really quick and started going out with some kid Jacob. She claimed she loved me, yet she did some ""unpleasant"" stuff with him. Which was fucked up, but i let it go. After that, my friend Kristen knows who this Jacob is. She tells me HOW he is, me, TRYING to be a good ex-bf called her up and told her about Jacob. What'd she do? No, not a thank you, nothing even close, she called me jealous and i was threatned by the punk ass kid to have my jumped by his boyz. Not to mention he wont fight me one on one cuz i'll rock his little cunt. I let all that go too. Every once in a while she'd throw shyt in my face. Shyt about me and her not being together and what not. You can only piss someone off so many times before they retaliate. My retaliation? I choose to not have anything to do with her,im done with all of it. Y? because without her i am a completely free man. I no longer have an overly-jealous gf bothering me about when or why i called or texted a gurl. No longer have to put up with someone talking to me like shyt, but if i even get close to doing it, i get hung up on or ignored. It'z all over with. The funny thing about all this is that now,she supposedly has realized that im not the one for her because im angry at the world and im supposedly dating ppl. Am i actually dating someone if i jus meet them for the 1st time? That's like MySpace but in person. So cuz i met someone we're automattically dating. Awesome. Hehe. This makes me giggle. Jus Thursday she told me she didnt want me or need me, and guess which one of us had the change of heart? So Gwen, good luck with Jacob. Really. Make sure u tell him what u did while he was away on vacation. And if u dont, dont piss me off so I wont tell him. Make sure you dont call me or text me anymore. Especially texts asking me if i wanna hook up for the night. I'm through. I'll be waiting for your reply.

We decided to wait up at K-mart and me and Kati, we play around alot. So she something like ""why dont u go eat shyt?"" and i replied with like ""why dont u go fuck urself?"" so she got all upset about it. Like why the fuck is it kool for her to say that shyt to me, but as soon as i reply with something im the bad guy? So Kristen had to take her home, cuz she was about to cry and shyt. I took Eddie home. We waited around, Shawn said we'd go at 9:15 and then me and Kristen went up there as well. We saw Deuce Bigalow: European Gigalow. That shyt was funny as hell. After that, we all went to McDonald's and since me and Shawn used to work there, we walked up in that bitch like we owned it and made ourself shyt to eat. We waited around about an hour and a half, i went home, and then i talked to Gwen till about 3, she gots a new bf now, and i think itd be best it he kept his hands to himself, he wouldnt wanna end up losing them. 15 minutes after that, my friend from Orlando, Marissa called me. Which was good, because my sister's 15th birthday is coming up. And for Spansih culture that's equal to a sweet 16. So my mom told me to find a ""date"" jus someone i could be paired up with, and Marissa said that her mom might let her come down from Orlando for that weekend so she can be my ""date"". Only thing that's gonna be a problem is that iuno where she's gonna stay after itz over. She might stay at her cuzin's house who lives down here or me and my dad might take her back that night. We dunno if she's even gonna be allowed to come down yet tho."

Got fired from my job at Save-a-lot, apparently i didn't have enuff ethusiasm to work there. But see when i go into my JOB, i go in to WORK, not to entertain. I asked him if he would've wanted me to come in dressed as a clown standing on my head blowing bubbles out of my ass, but that didn't go too well with him. Then on top of that he makes it seem like we were breaking up, he said we had to go our ""seperate ways"". Now tell me if that's not what every asshole bf says to their gf when they like another gurl, huh? He was a funny guy, i left, cuz i mean, he needs the job more than me. I don't look like a cross between Pee-wee Herman and Harry Potter with a mustache so he can keep his god damn job. And u kno what i dont get is....as i grow older, ppl decide to treat me like im some kind of punk bitch. U kno, i might not be the most muscular, biggest, or even the toughest motha fucka out there, but damn gimme a lil respect. Seems like ima lil punk to everyone these days and they all wanna step up, until of course i give them their 2 choices which are, either u quit fucking wit me, or u die. Cuz as of lately i've been quick to pull my blade out and unless u want a 6 inch deep gash inside of u, ud calm ur happy ass down. I remember that some kids decided to step up to me at the movies 1 day, they got too close to my car and i pulled the knife on 1 kid and i was like ""ay motherfucker, u wanna die?"" after that, they all switched their game up and left. I think it'll only be a matter of time till i lose control and jus filet a mofucka. Not to mention that im trying to get this Beretta sooo bad, then.....any mofucka decide to step up, ima go trigger happy on their ass. Ahhh my bright future going downhill as we speak,bwahaha.

"event","That's what i was thinkin to myself last night. As many of u read in one of the previous posts, if not THE previous post, some dude was threatening me of some shyt, that he was gonna kill me or something. Shyt doesn't phase me at all, cuz i had a blade ready for his ass. So all that shyt was dropped till yesterday. I went and hung out with this gurl Grace, her ex bf is the one who was threatening me and he called her like 15 times as private number. She didn't answer. He called her mom and when her mom told him she was with me, he called her saying ""what the fuck u doin wit manny?"" so whatever, he ruined the time that we hung out for. So she tells me to call her later on to do something again at night. So when i call her, she tells me she left the house cuz her mom and her had an arguement and she jus ended up leaving. So she tells me she needs a ride to downtown, but that she don't want me to drive because she got ""ppl"" with her. She called a cab and after she gets to Centenial Park she still needs a ride for HER to get to her aunt's house down at the beach. Me and my friend Eselina had made plans to go out, and outta the kindness of my heart and Eselina's heart, we go and get Grace from downtown, but before we get there, she text's me saying this: ""Manny, don't be mad, but im with Ron"". So let's clear this up: the kid Ron threatened me, had a bad break up wit Grace, she hated him, (or so i thought) and fucking now she's with him so i gotta give both of them a ride. So we finally find them, itz fucking Grace, Ron, and some other kid. Goes from 1 person, to 2 ppl, and then 3. They say they're gonna pay, which i said from the start they would have to or no fucking ride. So alright, we take them to the beach, and my anger started to wear off a bit cuz Grace was safe now, u kno? Downtown's dangerous at night and shyt and she's a gurl. So i was gonna look back at her and smile and then text her that i was sorry, but when i look back, the motherfucker Ron has his arm around her, so instantly i was pissed off again.So when we drop them off, the dude Ron gets outta the car, he drops a tiny lil knife on the floor, he bends over to pick it up and i thought about jus stabbin his ass there, but no, i remained calm, didn't do anything, i asked for the money and instead of paying the 10 they owed, they payed 7. And after i get home, Grace calls me saying that Ron thinks he left his phone in the car and shyt. When i told him he didn't leave it there he fuckin starts to whine ""that man has my shyt, i kno it."" im like ""he still talkin shyt? i shoulda jus murdered his ass when i had the chance"" since Grace has never really heard me when im mad she was freaked out and was like ""WHAT?!"" i was like ""fuck both of ya'll."" and i hung up. So all in all, this is what happened, my plans got ruined wit Eselina to go bail Grace outta trouble along wit someone i hate, and we get repayed with not even a fuckin THANX and 7 dollars in gas. So now....i've gotten to my point. And i kno so many of ya'll are gonna comment on how i shouldn't say some of this shyt or i shouldn't think in some of the ways i do, but, im done being a fuckin nice guy. This is what's gonna happen for future reference, if any time in the future she needs a god damn ride and that bitch is with her, ima agree to giving them the ride,but ima make sure i go up there with atleast 10 ppl, gonna do his ass in with everything we got. Beat his ass, a couple of bullet wounds, maybe a few gashes from my blade, and then ima tie his fuck ass up and stuff him in my trunk and start driving to wherever they needa go, if he jus so happens to die in my trunk, then i'll drive my car into a canal or something. Something's gonna happen tho and this motherfucker's gonna pay.

If lj drama so gay, why start it? Why go into MY fuckin journal, and read MY god damn entry about a simple statement i made. Oh shyt,my bad, i forgot, God's last name isnt ""damn"". Now ur religious? When's the last time u went to church? And i mean really go to church, to praise God and not stare at some 21 year old's package or something? The not only that, ur lil homeboy wants to step up to the plate ""u don't fucking kno me"" actually bitch, i do. I choked u out back in 10 grade right in front of ur gf, ashley gaston, u remember that? As soon as i reply to his comment,  he wants to step back down, saying he don't wanna start shyt, i think itz too late for that, when u leaving me a threatning comment (as lil of a threatning comment that was, cuz i've heard tuffer shyt from  my sister) i decide to strike back. Like i said before, ima be sitting behind both of ya'll 2-marrow at lunch, jus tap me on the shoulder and tell me to quit bothering u 2. That's all. Ima nice guy, jus ask all my friends =) on that note... 2 days away from Thanksgiving,i'll start my thanksgiving prayer now... ""God Damn (dammit,i keep forgetting itz not his last name) I mean, God, i give u thanks for everything,bitch who make more than me and get Thanksgiving bonuses along with a 25 cent raise but yet still cant pay me, i give thanks for their male friends, who decide to act hard, but in reality, ur as soft as marshmallows (which by the way i WILL add to my sweet potatoes this thrusday) and i also give thanks to stoopid bitches who say LJ drama is gay but yet are reading this very line right now, and will leave me a fucking comment, thank u God, Amen""

The secretary says, ""ok, nevermind he jus got here"". My mom was on the other fucking line, calling to see if i went to skool. So now...im looking for a place to stay.

Went up to the movies and saw my homegurlz: Heather? =D  that was pretty bad ass, hadn't seen her in a while and she gave me a hug ::blushes::. Went and saw ""Without a paddle"" it was pretty str8,not too funny, maybe it was cuz i wasn't paying attention since i told ppl that i was INSIDE the movies and they were still callin me like fucking crazy. Got home at like 12. Mom was pissed cuz i didn't call her......dont care, she got the number,lol. Prolly in trouble when my dad gets home from outta town. Peace.

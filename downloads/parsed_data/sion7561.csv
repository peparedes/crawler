"event","Well guys I know we don't normally post to these anymore. It's become a thing of the past but it's surprising to every once in a great while see something posted on here. Figured I'd give it a go and try to fill up space....

School: Friday was my final day at MSU and the long walk back to my car made me sentimental about the times I spent there. Granted I'm happy to be out but ironically I do have a lot of memories from that university and a lot of friends I'm going to miss. A few friends like Nikki and Pete I'm going to miss a lot, even old classmates that shared the same major with me I'll miss their company as well. I think the biggest thing I'll miss out of school was a sense of purpose and security. Going into my first and second year I remember being told often how important our class was, or our generation being silently assured a greater chance at success. This last year at school was one of my worst because those prenotations of growth and placement turn into fears of financial discomfort and potential job offers. Fact of the matter is MSU weaned me into their dream of academic success as well as job success, however it isn't as they preach. Regardless I'll miss it a lot, I meet some of the most amazing people there.

Senate: I said my final goodbyes to the Senator and his staff on Friday. That was a tough day for me and it just recently started hitting me. I've been in their office for a year now and in that amount of time I've done a lot to help individuals overcome challenging obsticles and have invested time into a complex and rewarding society of politicans. Helena and Marie became close friends of mine and I always knew I can ask for their help if needed. From their office I learned a lot of secrets and skills I could never get anywhere else. Outside my occassional complaininga about deadlines, I will without a doubt never forget my time there and I hope I can see them all once again.

Work: JCPenney decided to recognize me and my MANY accomplishments there by making me Sales Associate of the month and giving me regional recognition as one of their most valuable Loss Prevention Officers. Unoffically my assistant store manager has given me the role of LP Supervisor and asked me to start conducting those responsibilities. I've been very pleased to know that I'm one of the best in the state even only being there a short while but after all of these awards, I'm going to be placing my two weeks. Granted the praise is nice but the money isn't there and I need a semi-decent paying job now that I'm no longer at MSU. To fill that gap Kohl's seen my resume and success and decided to hire me into their store as ether a real suprervisor or a full time officer with an opening in 2 months for a supervisor. They want me to stay in their company and are paying me the right kind of money to keep me interested. It's ironic that this weekend I had the most catches out of any one officer in the Great Lakes Region..... ALL 5 STATES. So...... I'm going to give JCPenney's a chance to counter Kohl's offer but I think I'm leaving. See people, you may think I'm lazy, but in fact I work my ass off there.

Future: I'm leaving Thursday for the Dallas Police Department Academy testing. It involves a combination of Physical testing, written examinations, polygraph examination, and a oral board interrogation to determine my character and professional demeanor. If I pass all 4 I'll be invited back to the Deapartment for a background investiagation, medical evalutation, and psycological evaluation. On the completion of those then I'm hired in as a Police Recruit and enrolled into their Academy. Granted it's a lot of work to get in but I'm learning for more complicated jobs it takes this much to get in. The screening process is designed to weed out those they don't want. Many past drug addicts, felons, out of shape individuals, and lastly people who cannot maintain a professional character at all times. I'm told I have a 80% chance at passing and becoming a DPO with my background, education, and criminal history. The 20% is what I'm worried about, that's the chance my trip down there was for nothing and I don't wish to have that happen.

Health: In response to my up coming DPD evalutaion I decided to get in shape. Thus to date I've lost 43 lbs and have improved my physical apptitude in various areas of my body. I can run faster, further, lift more, and endure tension longer. I've never had a real reason to be in top shape but this has given me that excuse and in response I've made some serious sacrifices. I did all this to ensure I would pass without problem the PT of the DPD examination. In fact the only thing I'm worrying about now is that stupid Oral Board. I'm feeling like I can conquer the world right now.

Anna: She is amazing and has given me so much these past few months. For my birthday she decided to give me a GPS, a cake, make me dinner... a special dinner, and then top it off with loads of attention and praise. She's been taking it tough that I may be leaving and has decided to work hard at maintaining a long distance relationship in the event it happens. I'm happy to have her in my life and love spending time with her. Granted I know a lot of guys hate the fact that I spend so much time with her but she's trying to hoard me as much as possible until our seperation. I think Anna will be around for a very long time... that is, if she can appreciate 311 and the song Amber.

Closing Thoughts: A lot has changed this month and has been overwhelming but I think all for the better. I've been taking it well and trying my best to meet the challenges as oppose to running away from them. I hope all of your lives are doing well and wanted to thank you for the birthday wishes. Now... you must write a post like this and detail your life in chronological form! Oh and go to the SCIV tournament at Game Hits on the 23rd so I can rape some of you with Ivy."

"event","So I was looking over my billing for this semester and it's extremly high compared to others. I did the credit by credit check and I noticed that in the 4 years I've been in college, credits have increased by 69.6%! Essentially in 2005 it would have cost about $35,000 to get a bachlors degree. Right now at current credit costs it's going to cost more around $59,000! I'm just compeltely shocked at how terrible college costs are becoming, really disappointing."

BBW wants to get fucked.

I suppose it's more of a ""needs to get fucked"".

That says it all really.



I enjoy rough sex, anal, and getting taken from behind while I'm on my hands and knees begging for your cock. Think you can get me to cum nice and hard? Ever fisted a girl? Want to? It's the most intense thing I've ever experienced and the trust and vulnerability of it all turns me on.



I'm looking for a fun ""relationship"" that will be more than a one night stand but none of that boyfriend nonsense. Get me to cum, to scream out your name, to make a mess of your face with my juices, and we'll be best friends ;-)



Any of this interest you? Are you a cute MSU student perhaps? A well endowed young professional guy? Have a guy friend/ frat brother that would want to play with us too? I'm open to 3some talk, but only if it's mmf. It's always been a fantasy to get pounded while i have a dick in my mouth.



I want to find someone who can make me laugh as hard as he can make me cum. I get weak for kisses on my collarbone and guys in glasses. I promise to be open, up front, and honest with you and I expect the same.

"event","Well so far the new year hasn't brought me to much excitement but I'm hoping I can change all that with something different. 

I've been learning about various positions and processes of all levels of government. My major is exactly that, politics. So today while I was learning more and more about the political process and anaylizing the economy on a political level I had an apiffany. I've always wanted to try something different and unique, something I havn't done before that would force me to learn a new process at a whole different level of expertise.

Well that was competely realised today when I made the decision to run for one of the various positions of local government for Delhi Township. Granted I understand I'm not overtly qualified but I want to experience the degree and complexity of a local campaign race. I personally feel I'm more qualified then a vast majority of people in the world. Budgets and politics are my personal nitch, and because of this I would absolutly love a chance to be on one of the various electable boards in Delhi TWP.

I've already drawn up the paper work and will begin collecting signatures soon. My ultimate goal is to write a research paper on the experience and form a general opinion on how to run for local offices when I'm more qualified in the future. In the mean time I think this will keep my mind occupid and allow me to meet some of the local officals who run Ingham county. I'm realistic, and I know I won't be elected (even though it would be ironic if I did.) Still as someone asked me, why? Simply because I can and I want to see why people in these positions strive to be reelected. If the Senator can do it, why can't I.

I appealed to my local party and inacted some of my party rights. So I want to know if I can gain a party nomination as well, if not it's not to hard to run as an independent for one of the positions. Although I'd rather just have the Democratic partys nomination. So wish me luck"

"event","Well my time in the Senate is coming to a close, but I thought I'd share a couple things you'd find interesting. I'm going back in May despite the below but it is a learning experience...

The Myths:

Most people believe that the average State Employee is lazy, overpaid, and unsuited for the job.:
 
Lets face it, it takes weeks to get the Michigan machine going with any suitable outcome. People constantly complain how we need to lay off employees and cut salaries. I'm sure many of you agree with the above. Realities are, most State employees are overworked, underpaid, and very well suited for the job. Time lags exist because of overworked employees and huge caseloads. The average DHS employee alone handles hundreds of cases by their lonesome.

Government is out to help the people and protect their interest.:

Well even though we would love to see our State represent and give us what we want I found it deeply disturbing that Michigan policies treat the Government as a seperate entity with the people in mind. Currently money talks on Capital hill and you see many different business entities taking presedence over the peoples wants. Looking at current legislation it comes to no surprise that many of the human services, health, and various reform bills directed at Michigan residents still have not had their days in the House or Senate. Many of the bills you see deal with business reforms and tax issues.

Politicans are there to help the people and are not corrupt.:

This is a big yes and no myth. Michigan politicans vary and rank between them. The average new comer has good intentions and morals. However the elder statesman will most likly have close ties with the various lobbying firms in the area and doesn't concern themselves with Michigan criteria. It's something more or less like a club of people. Newcomers are not looked at kindly and take some getting used to. Their vote still matters but in the thick of things they are still only comprised of one. They want to get into the big committees and rallies. So those new guys join ranks with the big guys and get their support and vote in their favor for favors returned. This gives those sleezy politicans a leg up on the new guy and makes the entire legislature look bad. Unfortunatly their pull directly hinders the State and hurts the peoples images of the government, how many of you actually like our government anyway?

I can do it better if I were in that office.:

We all think this way including myself, truth of the matter is the system itself is in shambles and not the bodies who sit in the seats. It's tough to see the various cogs of the system turn around and realize that given the circumstances could you do anything better? People are still human and although the people frown on their decisions they come to these conclusions through various arguments and consultants. It's the people who lobby the biggest firms and make the most compelling arguments that win the minds of the legislature. The average legislature rarly comes to his conclusion on his own.

The Truths:

Government revolves around a select few individuals:

Truth be told our Government revolves around the idea that Senators, House Reps, the Governor, Judges, etc. are elevated people above the public. Let me explain in better details, they are given special treatment above all others in the Government. They are helded in high esteems, given lavous dinners, impressive invitations, and most of all egos. As a people we want to elect those that are like use, deal with our problems and experience our own pains in hopes they can relate and help change the problem. The average politican revolves around the idea of ""me."" ME ME ME ME ME ME, or better yet, my. The luncheons I attend with the Senator and the meet and greet with other Senators you see a similar behavior, it's all about my bill, and my chunk. Selfishness runs rampent in the Legislature and its fueled with those that serve fueling that intensity.

Politicans are relativly unworked... whatsoever.:

When you call a Senators office you will first talk to an intern, and then a Legislative Aide, and then Cheif of Staff, and then if you're lucky.... maybe..... better have money...... the Senator himself. The Senator delegates 95% of his tasks to his staff and spends his days mostly at home or seldom apperences. You can find him often in luncheons or dinners, or other such events that treat him with high esteem and shower him with attention. Actually field work or direct contact with his voters is rare. This past budget crisis demanded a lot from them and they fitted the bill but rest assured it was their staffs that paid the price. Sleep was lost on their part, not his.

Ass kissing is the best way to get anywhere within the Government.:

You wanna grab a seat somewhere within the Government, how about the direct Legislature. Best grab a bib and start licking ass checks, because that's how you're going to get anywhere. Use formal titles for everyone, if you don't it's offensive and more likly to lose credit if not permanate disapproval. Not all of them are this way, but a lot of them see themselves as better then you, if not see themselves as a supperior person who's interests should go ahead of your own. So don't question them and certainly don't mock them. Example: Our Aides WILL NOT edit or correct errors for the Senator when he's made his final draft, it offends him.

There are plenty more but my fingers are tired. Enjoy your Government and remember when you're voting for new people look for the ones that are outspoken and loud. They scare the old guys a little."

"event","I know it's been awhile since I've posted on this thing so I'm going to make a long boring uneventful entry like always...

Things have been very busy. I've begun since my last post originally as a Legislative Intern through Senator Switalskis office and I've since been given the formal title as Legislative Aide and told I can stay there as long as I want with some added extras. I have to say I've learned a lot through this experience and I've meet a lot of really interesting people. This has been both rewarding and encouraging, my own personal niche so to say.

I've accomplished in the short time I've been there great things and I can see why some of these people just don't leave. I've helped stop a fraudulent dentist, resolved a couple contract disputes, taken part in an ongoing investigation into faulty building practices and from the looks of it we are winning that case, investigated car dealerships for fraud, conducted several research assignments mainly for the budget... and the list goes on. I love this job, and I have no intention of leaving.

My latest assignment was tackling a sex offender who drove up to Michigan to have sex with a child in Detroit, and instead of having sex he was arrested and charged with Criminal Sexual Conduct III. To everyones surprise he found a legal loophole that allowed him to have HIS RECORD EXPUNGED and he was removed from the Sex Offenders List. On top of that he's currently in the process of having an order of protection removed that prevents him from molesting his two grandchildren. Low and behold they have given me this task. I know they think very highly of me for closing all of my cases with promising results but this is a case I don't want because of what's on the table. Money is one thing but the safety of children is another. So I've been in contact with the District Attorneys office, State Police, and I'm probably even going to go as far as contact the South Carolina Department of Corrections and see what I can do. Granted I can't do anything to get him back on the sex offenders list, but I can provide the proper documentation to close that loophole and possibly find a way to prevent him from doing anything else. This is preasure... and hell the OTHER interns get to just sort mail and do reports on education reform, BUT NOOOO I get the sex offender. I guess this comes with the new position, should be interesting. Wish me luck guys.

From the offices standpoint our Cheif of Staff Helena keeps telling me how great of a worker I am and that I'm one of the best interns they've had in years. Part of the reason I was given such difficult tasks. I blame our construction case in which I just walked in on the dillemma and then gave them information that allowed them to blow the lid off of the case and really do soemthing. Since then I've been hailed and revered. 

Anna and I have been doing great! We are going on our 9 month anniversary and we are both still madly in love! We've been designating set times to spend away from eachother so we can do other things like school and friends. We've learned that if we stay with eachother over night on a school night we run an almost definite chance of NOT going to class the next morning because we are both just WAYYYYY to comfortable. So we've learned to methods to make things coincide with our lives.

<img src=""http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/2956/61e2b0c894c9if6.jpg"">

One thing though and I need like a signed petition or something. Anna won't go to Haunted Houses with me!!!! She doesn't like them and this makes me a sad Panda! HELP!

Family life is TERRIBLE!!!!!!! I mean absolutly terrible. I've never seen my family so disfunctional and on edge. I feel this is the final point in which my family stays together and cooperates. 

What happened was my younger brother was caught with a large quantity of Marijuana and expelled from school. He's also facing some serious charges from the Prosecuting Attorneys office... hell this would actually be held at the District Court level so the DA will be prosecuting him because of the severity of the crime. He's also pending a previous charge for a BE he committed last summer and has a hearing on that later this week. Needless to say you can already imagine how my parents are feeling, heartbroken and distraught.

My mother has been on the fringe of throwing him out of the house and sending him to live with his father. My father has spend thousands on an attorney to keep my brother out of jail... which is looking less and less likly every single day. Both of them are jeopradizing their marriages and have been devesatated. The sheer thought of their son going to jail disturbs them and it shows. My brother all the while has just now seen the implications of his actions and is heart broken he's not allowed on school grounds anymore, but that's the only remorse he has.

All in all the way I'm seeing it is my parents are fighting because they feel they have failed as parents. They feel they have a specific obligation and wish that as long as they do this for him he will turn a new leaf and become a good person. He hasn't done this the past 5 times and I don't think he will in the future. I love my brother and I will be sad to see him go, but I also love reason and fairness and both the system and school district were more then fair to him all the prior times he screwed up. I have no problems with people who make mistakes as long as they can stand 2 inches taller afterwards. Yet my brother just feels he's invincible and has no remorse for his victims or his actions. I feel he needs to be sent away for the safety of others and most of all his own parents.

This has caused me to evaluate my own being and person and to look at things through a different set of eyes. Is it right to wish such punishments on family? Is it unreasonable to think about fairness and what is right or am I suppose to have a pre-set bias always in favor for the well being of family dispite their actions. I can tell my parents have had a lot of distain towards me over these past few weeks since this incident with my brother. He's always been the closest one to them because of all his interactions with the police and he reminds them of themselves as kids. Me on the other hand have followed a pretty straight path keeping in boundaries with what's right and what need to be done. I think my mother especially has been holding resentment towards me because of it. They always tell me how proud of me they are but I take it with a grain of salt now. I tell you, my family is in shambles.

Thankfully Anna's family has filled that gap where mine has failed and I'm grateful of it. I love her parents to death and I miss them often. They've always given me respect and made me feel welcome into their household. I love Anna a great deal, but her family definitly gives her the edge over when it comes to wanting to be with her for a very long time.

Lets see here... not to much more to talk about that's interesting. Resident Evil Extinction was a terrible movie, 3:10 to Yuma was phenominal, and War was excellent. I've developed a personal hatred towards local opinion columns and can now say with absolute certainty don't take what they say seriously, they are not educated in their opinions...

I had a great time Saturday night at Jasmines and I can't wait to have that happen again.

That's about it, later!"

"event","It's been awhile since I've given an update about my own life, so I figured why not...

Things lately have been going smoothly, and now everyday is just waiting on the next day to come to pass. School is coming to an end and now I've been looking into my future, heavily. Come 9 months I'll have my first bachlors degree from Michigan State and come December of next year my second. Now I've been forced to look at the big option of, where do I go from there?

I've been looking at the local economy and I can tell without question Michigan is a dying state, not worth staying in. I've come to love this area, some of my most precious memories are from Lansing, and all of my family is here... but without doubt I will not be applying for law school in Michigan. Since then I've been looking at two states, one more then the other, but two regardless, California or New York. My father has always told me go where the money is and beyond a doubt these two states have what I need.

I'm patiently awaiting my fall internship through the State Senate Committee. It should be an experience unrivaled. The thought of finally being where I've always wanted to be is so fulfilling and now I can say without hesitation what I do. Quitting Game Hits was probably one of the best decisions I made (although premature) but now I feel I have a meaningful job which is important to me.

Money will soon not be a problem, and in two weeks I'll be 10 thousand dollars richer... sort of. I've just decided to take a second loan out against my name and pay off all of my remaining debts and consolidate my debt into one single source. I'm hoping it works out because in the long run I'll save money on interest and it will reflect my future income which even without law school will be substantially high.

So where to from here? What's next? That's the million dollar qustion. It all seems pretty set in stone, all of my plans in the future are laid out years in advance. Where's the excitment, the random surprises? 

That's where Anna has come in. Over these past 7 months Anna and I have grown very close, and anyone who sees us together can tell without a doubt how happy we make one another. Things seem like they fell into place with the two of us, that this was destined to be. I always questioned why things happened the way they did over a year ago... which is still hard to fathom it happened over a year ago. I didn't even have an apittamy until Janurary when I meet Anna that all that had happened, all that pain and suffering was all... for a purpose. I was suppose to go through that to learn and understand what happiness was to me and what it was like to be alone. From that learning experience I learned what happiness was to me and I didn't stray when I found Anna, she was EXACTLY what I was looking for in a girl, and has turned into someone I can trust.

The two of us have now come to question our own futures together, and as of right now the light is green. We are both happy to be with one another, still driving back and forth to see the other and in a couple weeks she'll finally be living back in East Lansing and we can go right back to how things were earlier this year. We've had a couple bumps up and down the road but in the end of the night we are still happy to be with the other. We still seem pretty determined to live with eachother come next year when Wendy and I's lease expires, and I think she's going to be traveling abroad to Australia... which is something I myself have thought of doing, I would love to Study in London... and as long as I can countinue to take out extra student loans I think I'm going to... maybe, as long as it doesn't effect my ability to graduate on time.

Right now Anna and I are 100 miles apart and we havn't seen one another in 3 days. As lame as this is going to sound it feels like a 1000 miles apart and 3 weeks have gone by. Things just seem black and white when she's not around, and when she's here everything is in a bright color. Almost as if all of lifes problems (especially MTH 103) come together in some detailed phenominon. I'm truly blessed to have her in my life, and all the BS I have to go to just be with her is completely worth the effort, and I think she knows that. 

My 22nd birthday is coming up shortly, and just so you know it's not a big deal. It's more like a reminder that I finally hit the age in which I am no longer entitled to have celebrations on my birthday. I planned on spending it sleeping in, going to the DMV and renewing my plates, then probably coming home and playing some sort of video game. If Jim and Ed are up for it I'll probably just go over to Ed's place and LAN with those two and play some Supreme Commander or Dawn of War. Now THATS a birthday worth remembering. It's not even worth celebrating knowing the one person who wants it to be the happiest isn't even going to be in the lower half of Michigan... so, it's just another day, maybe I'll even have to work, who knows. Speaking of birthday presents though, this is going to be a hard one to top, Anna bought me a Ipod Nano, after claiming forcfully that I am possibly the only person on the planet (excluding Africans) that doesn't have one. I feel cool.

Life is great bottomline, and I couldn't be happier.

Now back to Anna! It's almost 6 months now and I think to myself DAMN, how in the hell did it go by that fast? It feels just like yesterday I meet her for the first time. Truth of the matter is our first date was a whole lot like this....

Jake: TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK
Anna: Stares:: Looks at food:: Makes remark about parents then quotes a movie.
Jake: TALK TALK TALK ARE YOU OK???? TALK TALK TALK
Anna: ........................... I think she talked here.....

Our first date was so funny and unoriginal. Out of all the first dates I have been on Anna was by far the quietest girl I had ever gone out with. She was shy, had NO idea what to do, say, anything. You could tell she was new at the whole dating thing. Now normally on first dates I would take a girl out to dinner then from there go and do something unique and exciting, something that would at least make her remember me. This girl I could tell probably didn't care what we did and I was dying to see the movie ""Children of Men"" for a third time and I figured hey, what the hell. It's bloody, violent, completely UN-romantic... it's perfect, Matt and I loved it. 

Originally Anna to me was just another number, a girl to pass the time while I waited for my ex to finally give in to what I wanted. So after the movie (you could tell she wasn't expecting that) Anna and I get in my car and I'm trying hard for her to lighten up talk a bit more, basically become more comfortable around me, but it was getting late for her so I decided to take her home. Upon dropping her off we are caught in the strange ""what to do"" situation. Typically when you are walking someone up to their room you give them a hug and if it went REALLY well a kiss... cars though, they are tricky. You can lean over and give them a hug, but the more common thing to do is lean over and give them a kiss... why, it's easier to kiss in a car then hug. So coming up to her dorm room, dead of winter she tells me how wonderful of a time she had and hopes we can do it again and reaches over to say goodnight in a ""hug"" fashion... or at least I thought. Out of nowhere she assaults me in my car and starts making out with me... hot asian style and then pulls away with this curious shy girl look on her face.... and here I was thinking to myself, was I just raped?

Strange thing was... that's exactly what I was going to do! I just wasn't expecting her to pull the first move on me. Truth be known I had never really kissed a real asian girl before (half asians don't count) and I was dying to see what it was like. So all night this shy cute girl who was nervous and probably uncomfortable for hours on end out of nowhere attacks me in my car and makes out with me... not very shy like. So I ask her a simple question of... ""do you want to go back to my place, the night isn't over just yet!?"" She stumbles a little and then inevitable says yes and I quickly turn around and head back to my new place, that dreaded coop in East Lansing. It was just right around the corner so it was a short drive.

There we watched V for Vendetta and she finally starts opening up and talking to me underneth a blanket on my bed and I think that's when we had our first real conversation, it was nice. The night goes on and I think around 4am I take her home and call it a night. The very next day I get a message on facebook and it's from her telling me again how great of a night she had and thanking me for not being a ""Dayne"" AKA ""Guy trying to get laid."" That made me feel really good, I learned that lesson a long time ago and how horrible I felt afterwards and it was nice to know she appreciated it. So when was date two going to be? Well... she didn't wait very long, it was the next night and we decided to go see another movie, one that completely slips my mind, but that was probably the best date I had been on.

She was like two different people, and the second time around she was open, smiling and being herself. It was releaving to actually have a real date with her and afterwards we ended up back at my place again watching movies and screwing around on the internet talking about life. Shortly afterwards we stopped seeing eachother for various reasons and about a week later I got a call from her asking me to buy her beer, because Anna was still only 19 at the time, tisk tisk. So being a nice guy (I almost didn't pick up the phone, but today I'm glad I did) I buy her some beer for her and her friends and she meets me at my coop and picks it up and we part our ways again.

Originally after our seperation I just decided to keep her as a friend much like another girl I used to date Nicole. We didn't work out dating but I think Nicole and I are really great friends and I could see that with Anna easily. Odd thing was seeing Anna again made me realize... I really missed her. The next day I get another message on facebook from her and turns out the feeling was mutual and that night we made plans again for dinner and afterwards whatever. It was after that night things between the two of us started to get really serious. 
We'd spend every night together, what was 4 or 5 dates quickly turned into dozens and soon afterwards we become what we are today.

Nether of us realized how much we loved the other until Spring Break when we couldn't stand to be away from eachother and I decided to drive to see her and meet her parents for the first time in Grand Haven (A drive I've become accustomed to... like twice a week.) Yet, in one week I did that 5 times, back and forth over and over again. I'd leave right after work then get back into Lansing early the next morning to do it again. It was apparant after that week we knew this was going to last a very long time.

So it leads me to today, where it's been nearly 6 months and we are both still missing the other desperatly. Summer has been hard on both of us but I think it's made us both appreciate the time we have together. We see eachother 3 days out of the week, sometimes 4 depending on our schedules but both of us can agree, we want to live together now, not later. I'd say you'll see that happen when Wendy and I end our lease. We crave the others presence and I couldn't be happier with who I'm with. To put it simplier, this isn't a girl I started to immediatly have seconds thoughts about 2 months into the relationship and that tells me something, especially now that it's 6 months into it. I love her, plain and simple."

"event","Ok so I'm bored at work today and typically I'll watch movies or play some shitty ass game to pass the time. Today instead I decided to start browsing peoples myspaces to just see how they're doing and if anything new has come up in their lives.

So I was browsing Rei's myspace and I was reading some of her comments and this one just jumped out on the page. I started reading it and my initial reactions were ""I must post this so people like Carl and Jasmine can read it."" Basically below is the comment posted by her friend James. He's one of those guys that is attached to her... possibly physically and I believe he's gay and quite emo. I never liked being around him and usually just tollerate him when I'm around friends, so I don't see any reason why I can't humiliate him and make fun of him. I'll just pass on to him some of what he originally gave me by touching me at Dennys and signing into my ear.

---------------------------------------------

Hello, I miss your ready contact.

Oh god Rei, I don't want to be here. Anywhere. I dont know what to do. I dont want to care and yet it hurts when I dont.

I cant talk to anyone.

God I am starting to cry.

I miss Marie. I miss being happy, I really thought I was, but I ... I just get involved and excited. Happiness eludes me. 

I wish people would just think a little... I cant handle being left hanging. I cant do it cause I'll get fucked over last minute waiting for them to come through so I dont feel bad that I didnt wait.... And they never, ever, ever do.

FUCKING RETARDS. Do they do it on purpose. Jesus I know I am annoying but I dont intentionally try to make people want to hurt me.

and yet it seems they do...

I want to just hit people,It would be so much easier.

I dont want to cry. I want to feel... not like no one cares. That if i just stopped helping people, didnt call anyone, that mor people than the ones that cry on my shoulder would call. 

Someone, Anyone would call just because, to see how I am doing, and not bitch because I dont every time they see me. I HATE EVERYONE

I cant stop fucking crying now...

I HAT E PPL THey are horrible 

I amk trying so hard. I dont think I'm going to that prom... I'll just cry. I didnt work hard enough and it degenerated to a full blown Gay Prom drag show and all.

I hate it.

I havnt even a date if I wanted one, and I cant ask her, I dont even know if I can.

fucking crying.

Jen called, might go. And there is the one I can rely on to actually call me.

For nothing Id just do some of that shit I always stay clear from... Anything.

fucking headache and too close to time to get up to start drinking...

havnt done that in a while.

Out of sight, out of mind= me 
-------------------------------------------------------

Last night a friend was telling me how I'm a jerk and when I make fun of someone I can hurt their feelings. Well... honestly I'm an asshole and I'll probably be an asshole for the rest of my life. It's just in my nature to point out peoples shortcomings and then turn them into a joke to humor the world. I've always came to the conclusion if you can't laugh at your yourself you have a problem. Remember I used to have a fucking unibrow and a giant set of mantitties. I can give a flying fuck less if you make fun of me for it, I think it's funny as hell. I'm secure enough with myself to know that it's funny and I won't let it get to me. 

Some of you obviously don't have that same sense of security. I think many of you just havn't realized that when a person pokes fun at you looking for a laugh it's actually because they like you and are intentionally trying to get you to laugh. Nothings easier then what's in front of you. So I'm asking people to rip me a new hole in the comments of this journal entry. Get on photoshop make degrading Adam Nevins style pictures of me, please I ask of you. I need to prove a point and I'm going to use myself to prove it. 

Basically ridicule me for all I'm worth... while laughing at that emo assclown James for being such pussy. Please James if you're reading this take this advice and take it to hurt... stop being a pushover, grow some balls, and take life as a man. Whinning about shit doesn't mean it's going to change the world especially you stupid ass drag prom show thing.

So there guys, do it, I command of you.

Jake Walls has finally put in his notice to quit at Game Hits Gamestore. After six long years I have finally decided to hang up my coat and quit the store and move onto bigger and better things. This decision comes from the sheer fact that I absolutly hate retail and I want to solely focus on school and nothing but school (Also some financial reasons.) I'll still have a job come August working through the Senate committee on Capital Hill, but Game Hits will be without Jake come August.

So... Shawn has asked me to help find a replacement even though he stresses I'm invaluable and can't be replaced. Alas though I still need to help a little to find someone of equal quality and caliber. The hours are part time, you won't make a whole lot but most of the work is easy. If you intend to take up my work load... then expect to be a slave. I'm trying to convince Shawn to hire two employees as opposed to one that way it can be more logical on balancing the work load here at the store.

I have to say, I'll miss the place, and I can sure as hell tell Shawn is taken off guard by it. Poor guy was expecting me to stick around for another year, but I don't think I can go for another year here... I've already lost it.

So to fuel my finances I've just decided to begin the trend of taking out private loans for college. Starting I'm going to take about $20,000 for my last year of school and pay off all my expenses including my car, credit cards, etc. From there just live life like normal and focus on school and nothing but! So the only expenses I'd have to cover are food and leisure activities... which I don't spend a whole bunch on. This way I can focus on school and not worry at all about who I'm going to pay this and what I have to save now for that and etc. Should make my last year of school fun, exciting, and exhilierating!

In other news Anna and I are going on our 5 month anniversary tommorow! That girl is amazing, I think we make an amazing team together. We are like Shake is to Bake, what Cheese is to Jim, what Russ is to Lazy, or what stench is to Taiyon. It's just a relationship that I spend ever waking moment loving to be in. She writes me letters, poems, tells me I'm not fat as opposed to some of you assholes!!!! She even buys me Ice Cream, do you HEAR THAT ICE CREAM! That's love! See, we make a good couple....

<img src=""http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/8272/3341e828f2b5ud6.jpg"">

Also Wendy and I are getting along really well! Even though our internet still blows ass, we havn't killed or teabagged the other... which is weird because I don't think it's possible for her to do such a thing. We typically take care of the place and havn't had any incidents where I've buttered the floor so she'll slip and fall and she hasn't summoned a plane to fall our of the sky and kill me. Also I hate Little people Big World... it sucks.

Shows that don't suck... Yes! Hells Kitchen is single handedly the greatest show on television right now. It's like amazing to watch people getting insulted and wasting food.

I don't know what else to write about. Except that Carl is a flaming faggot and I hate it when I wake up at night and find him looking over me touching himself. Also I havn't been able to find any pairs of boxers inside my room... Carl?"

"event","Spotlight 10, Boredom at work edition...
Wow, what a month, I'm actually really enjoying 2007 so far. I remember about a year ago how much I hated life, and now... it's a complete 180! Lets see how May treated me....

1) LIVING SITUATION
Wakes/Jendy's apartment: So Wendy and I are offically roommates, and so far so good. Today marks our tenth day living together, and I'm really enjoying her as a roommate. She's neat, quiet, doesn't drink or eat babies, she's just an all around nice person! I think it's going to work out nicly, but we still need to fill out some of the spaces... well.... all of the spaces. Outside of our rooms the rest of the apartment is pretty bare, I'm sure Wendy can agree with this. We'll figure it out though, but so far I think we'll end up being great roommates. Oh and just so you know, Wendy I'm sorry!!!!! For like... everything!!!!!


2) ANNA
We are PHENOMINAL! I've never been happier with someone before! The first night living in my new apartment Anna drove all the way from Grand Haven and spent the night with me for a couple days. My only regret was she couldn't stay with me longer. I don't think I would have wanted the first night there to be spent with anyone else except her. I'm happy and content in knowing I have her in my life and can't wait for more and more time to pass. She's amazing, plain and simple. We have a system worked out right now in which she comes down every end of the week and typically stays with me until Wednesday or Thursday morning and then leaves until Sunday or Monday. Sometime inbetween there I'll drive down and see her to share the burden. It's nice when she's with me, we can sleep in all day and laugh and just have fun together. It makes me wish we lived together already. 

3) SCHOOL
I actually have a month to myself! Classes for me resume in July so in the mean time I have some time to spend to myself and enjoy just freeloading around at work or even better, in front of a computer screen. However this last semester made my GPA jump up .14 so that was nice. Soon Summer semester will start and from there I should be able to get another GPA jump, summer classes for me are all so easy. Just one more year left at MSU, senior year I think will be the best year of my life.

4) FITNESS/EATING
Jim once called me fat, I'm fat. I crave Ice Cream like I crave Diet Pepsi. I don't know why I ever ask for a Diet Pepsi when I order triple fried french fries or eat a bag of Dorritos. My daily work out is stuffing my face with filling cookies or enchilladas. God they sound so good right now!!!!!

5) WORK
Game Hits has hit its slow season of the year, May has always been horrible for sales. It's hot outside and no one wants to buy video games... I don't blame them. Typically June and July are similar months but a little better. So it's nice to have things slow down at the store... it sure as hell beats Fall when I was pushing 50 hour weeks plus school! Granted the money was great that month, but damn.... I swear the hours worked made me so exhausted. I remember one week I had to move, study for and take my final exams, and work everyday for the Christmas holiday. God that was ungodly fun, and I know it will happen again this year.... I'm not looking forward to it. Yet even though it's slow in May I've been working a lot of hours, I've been averaging about 45 hours a week at the store right now... typcally only getting a day off a week. It's nice, but part of me keeps thinking this is suppose to be my summer vacation! June I'm suppose to have my normal hours back, and I hope I do for a short while before school starts up, that would be enjoyable.

6) GAMES
I quit EVE awhile back and used that money to pay off all my living expenses for a couple months and now I sit with no games to play. I'm probably going to take home a Xbox 360 sometime soon and catch up on some games, maybe even grab a PS2 and play this famed God of War 2 I hear so much about. I kind of want to dumb myself down sometime soon and space out in front of a television screen, it would be super enjoyable. Any recommendations?

7) Cedar Point
Jim was a super wonderful awesome sexy beautiful god-like friend this weekend and treated a bunch of us to Cedar Point. I will keep my promise on this one when I say I'm going to get him back sometime soon, and someone is getting an awesome Christmas present. Thanks buddy, both Anna and I had a great time and we owe it all to you! You're a great friend!!!!!!

Outside of the fact that I got burned on my scalp of all places I had a blast. Here it is Thursday, two days after the trip and I'm still exhausted. I think I'm going to need a weekend of relaxation to catch up. 

The lines were incredibly short and at night there literally were no lines. I think Jim picked the best time to go to Cedar Point, and I hope we can do it again next year... when we all have money and can at least treat him to the same hospitality he treated us this year. I want to clarify I'm not a pussy because I didn't ride the Powertower!!!! It's just too high up and unappealing... I don't want to just drop freely. At least I was a real man and went on the Top Thrill Dragster, no one else could HANDLE THE SPEED! I'm a real man.

8) Sexual References
I am going on the record to say this right now: I cannot fucking stand penis anymore. I love cock, but I absolutely fucking hate penis at the moment. Everything is the same old contrived shit that we have been seeing for months on end. Good, talented cocks are fed to glorified body builders who don't have an ounce of talent in their bodies. And of course, story lines that are so goddamn stupid that they insult the intelligence of penis fans everywhere, and THAT'S certainly saying something. But the company still makes tons of money from the kids covered head to toe in ass merchandise, that's there's no point in longtime fans such as myself complaining since they're not going to listen anyway and just say ""WE'RE NOT HERE TO IMPRESS THE INTERNET!"". I wish small penis was a better option but even though it's marginally better, it still suffers from more dumb story lines and the feeling that they're trying to cram way too much into the 1 hour time slot. The only thing that I have going for me is moderate sized penis's, which is practically impossible to catch up on a regular basis. Russ, Jim, and myself went to a moderate sized penis show in Detroit at the end of March and it was fucking awesome. Solid cocks, entertaining matches and characters, a personable feeling between the crowd and performers in the bed, and simple yet believeable storylines. Another show is coming to Detroit in September and we're trying to get as many people to head with us again since (as of this posting) 2nd row tickets are still available. We should probably get our money together soon and gets these tickets while they're up for grabs. They're $35, so if you're interested, drop me a line and we'll get it set up ASAP. (LOLZ)

9) SPIDER-MAN 3/LOST/PIRATES 3/LITTLE PEOPLE BIG WORLD
Ok... it's simple. See this movie one time and you'll be disgusted, see it twice you're a fucking idiot, see it three times and you're probably working in a home for the disabled. I mean come on people, how bad does a movie have to be for you to NOT see it? This is the single biggest disappointment in my life.

Lost ended on a great note, but it didn't leave me absolutly DYING for the fourth season like Battlestar Galactica did. I feel moderatly ok with not seeing the series anymore. It was a great ending to a lame season. Season 3 had it's shinning episodes, but for the most part it was a horrible season, and a majority of America agrees with me. I'll give it a viewing come January but come the inbetween months, unlike Matt, I can definitly not lose sleep over it.

Pirates 3 was a great movie, it was entertaining, had action, had a lot of story that was semi-believable and it didn't make me go ""WTF"".... well...... it did when Elizabeth goes on this whole ""You can do it pirates"" speech on the boat that had me wanting to hang myself. Outside of that Pirates 3 is a great movie and was definitly a worthey candidate for taking the top spot.

WHY WENDY WHY DO YOU WATCH IT!!!!! STOP IT!

10) FUTURE
Anna and I have a wedding to attend in July for her brother and then later on it's back to class for me. It's my last year at Michigan State and I cannot wait to get my degree. I've been debating if I want to go directly to grad school or actually take a couple years, get my finances in order and make it so I can live on my own without having a job while in grad school. I was debating whether or not to get a job at the state and then buy a new car and pay it off then, it would make better sense and make it so I don't need to worry about money while in school. It makes more sense, but it will delay my entrance into what I really want to do. We'll see as time goes by, until next time!"

So I had one of those days today, where I nearly snapped on customers, my boss, my family, and almost ran someone off the road for being a dumb ass. It's one of those days where all you want to do is severly hurt someone or god forbid those closest to you. What can I say, I havn't slept well ever since I moved back home and it's not only aggrivating but also down right painful, I've had this constant headache for a week straight. However, because I don't deal with guilt all that well, I just wanted to say sorry to all of those who's night I contributed in some way in ill effect. Trust me when I say tonight wasn't a night you wanted to be around me. Oh and just so you know Rei, I did drive out to Meijer later on and check for your Ipod, I didn't find it, so I'm hoping someone came and beat me to it.

In other more bright and shinny news, Anna and I celebrated our 4 month anniversary today! I love her so much, I don't recall ever being this madly in love with a girl before. I've spent hundreds... maybe even close to a thousand dollars on gas driving to see her. I've put thousands of miles on my car and typically run an oil change every month now! I've NEVER felt this compelled to see someone before! As if Anna is made out of cocaine and is this walking asian cocaine monster giving me my hits everyother day. She's wonderful, and I deeply love her. I don't even remember the last time I was this happy in my life!

I hate home, I want to kill people here, I just want my apartment. Thank god for Grand Haven, I'm starting to think I need to just move there... hell I spend half the week there... even on the days when I have to work early the next morning. It's my home away from home and I absolutly love Annas family, they not only make me feel welcome but I feel more apart of their family at times then with my own.

I was reading today that nudest colonies are looking for younger college graduates to join their ranks. Turns out most of their membership, some 90% are people 35 and older. I can see why they want younger hotties coming into the organizations, no one wants to stare at 50 year old boobies.

I just ate a big bowl of cerel and got off the phone with Jasmine, she made me feel better about the day, thanks!!!!!!

I don't know what else to write about... I'm going to go to bed then wake up again in the morning and leave again for Grand Haven."

I didn't go to that class for a month straight and didn't turn in multiple assignments! WTF! I failed 3 quiz's and I still got a 4.0? I must have made one amazing final paper! It goes on to a 3.5 in my CJ class, and that class at one point I was failing.... 3.0 in my NSC 454 class.... and that I failed the first exam, then finally 2.5 in the Supreme Court. Over all I almost made the Deans List! I fell short though :( So no amazing Deans list for me. It raised my GPA .14 to an astonishing!!!!! 2.84 which is still NOT 3.0. At least though it's going back up, and that means my Senior year at this rate I should be able to get above a 3.0 which would be nice."

"event","Well, I finally got my internet back and can make a formal post, oh and for those who talk to me on AIM, those times when I disconnect without saying goodbye... it's my internet! FORGIVE ME!

I have to live at home until May 21st, and it's quite different. I'm sharing a bedroom with my older brother who just moved back home as well. I can't say ""moved"" back home, but he just got out of jail and didn't have much of a choice. Ironically it's nice to see him, we've been spending a lot of time catching up and well.... ironically drinking a lot. I havn't really had a real conversation with my older brother since he moved out, and that was about 4 years ago! A lot has changed for the both of us and it's nice to see he finally knows what he wants in life and is going for it... I'm proud to say he's my brother for once!

The other brother is where the trouble is at. I swear, less then ONE HOUR of living at home I already started having problems with him, and for better or worst the cops showed up to question him on an ""earlier"" incident involving a big fight at someones house. Luckily for him the women who owned the property decided to drop charges on him, but many of his friends are in jail at the moment. So needless to say I havn't been around here that much, and I'm starting to run out of things to do. I'm going stir crazy trying to figure out what to do while I'm at home. No school, not much work, it's just me finding things to occupy my time, it kind of sucks! With my younger brother here... it makes it all the worse.

Still though it's odd being back in my old place. I set up my room like it used to be when I lived here and it's... full of memories. Some for better and some for worst, but I normally stay up at night staring at things remembering old times. I never would have thought that I would have missed this place as much as I did, there is a certain safeness here. I even went through some of my old boxes from my first apartment and found a bunch of pictures that survived the mass burning back in September. I will say one thing I regret whole heartedly is burning all those pictures, looking back on it, it's one of those things I wish I could take back, it never helped the pain, it just caused me to regret more in the end.

Yet looking at the future I'll be getting a new apartment May 21st and it's going to be GREAT! Wendy and I are thrilled we'll be able to have a place that's not home. I just hope she doesn't pick me up and throw me against the wall and choke me to death... 

I spent all day Monday and Tuesday morning in Grand Haven. It's a beautiful place and Anna lives there! So that makes it all the more better! It's paradise this time of year, and makes me wish I lived there personally, but maybe one day I'll have that chance. In the meantime Anna and I are doing great! The distance is killing us but we're at least coping with messages and phone calls. I will say she's a great girl, definitly more then my equal. Originally she cost me $150 in gas during Spring Break, lets see how much she costs me in gas for summer... I'm sure it will be a lot. She's worth it!

Well it's late and I wouldn't mind getting some sleep. Life is slowly moving forward, and I hope it's for the best! I hope everyone is well, oh and Carl, my mom says Hi!"

"event","A quick update...

May's looking more or less like a big pain in the ass now...

May 7th is the very last day I'm allowed to live on my house's premises. I have every intention of moving out the 6th but the date is so close to finals that I'm only going to have a couple days to prepare for the move. As I'm seeing it I'll have Saturday night to pack up and leave the next morning...

I'll be living back home with Mom for exactly 15 days, and offically as of May 3rd my older brother will just be getting out of jail having spent the last 7 months behind bars. Granted I love my older brother, but I'll have no choice but to be living downstairs in our basement with him... and that's just not sitting ok with me. I havn't lived with my siblings in years, and now having to live with both with no private spaces to myself... it's going to be hell. If any of you have heard the stories I've told about my siblings, you know exactly why I don't want to be there. My dad was nice enough to tell me I can come and stay with him if I needed to, but then again I look at the cons of that... no internet... and that's hell. So... mom it is, and I'll be dealing with the drugs, stealing, and yelling, headphones are going to make a come back!

May 21st is the day Wendy and I are suppose to be getting our dig. That day is going to be quite possibly the happiest day of my life. Leaving hell (Avalon) moving to another hell (home) and then my own apartment!!! I cannot possibly wait! Wendy looks to be a great roommate and no guys, I'm not going to throw her cellphone out the window! If anything I think we are going to get along quite well, and that makes me very happy!

My beautiful Anna is leaving May 4th and I won't see her living in this area again until August. It's going to be the hardest three months in our relationship. We are so used to seeing eachother every single day and not seeing eachother for weeks on end is not only going to be a struggle, but a test on how well our relationship can handle distance. There's no question I love her, I just hate not having my best friend around when I'll need her the most. She has been my rock for these past couple months, and without her I would have been a mess much like I was all of last year. We've been together for almost 3 months now, and that's an accomplishment in itself.

I think it's time to see if I can peg off some cash from my parents, both of them have given my siblings lots of money, hundreds of dollars and Jake has gotten a big fat $0. I think I'll see about getting all the repairs on my car paid for by my dad and then bug my mom to pay off some of my credit cards and reduce my interest payments. I am after all the good kid! I go to college live on my own and I dont get arrested!!!!! I'm sure if I asked my dad would even be willing to help me with a months rent just for being his son, he did last year and that was awesome, it gave me a bunch of extra spending cash and that's FUCKING OFF THE CHAIN! Hell maybe for those two weeks I can just do some repairs on my car like I've wanted to, ironically I enjoy wrenching, I just enjoy knowing how to not to fuck up my car. Give it the attention it deserves, the tune-ups and the new tires, get it ready for my MANY trips to Grand Haven.

I finally got rid of some dead-weight friends. I told Amanda finally to fuck off and decided that a couple other friends just aren't worth keeping around. I barely talk to any of the girls I used to date, the only one I think is worth keeping around is Nicole and we've become very good friends. The Amandas, Mary, Stephany, and a couple other ones I just don't care to talk to anymore. I even told Dayne's ex-girlfriend to fuck off and stop calling me. It's sad when your supposive best friend tells you EVERY SINGLE time you talk that you're a ""horrible friend and not deserving of her friendship."" It was like talking to my ex-girlfriend, everytime I was around her I felt less about myself, as if I could never please her, so she's gone. I havn't talked to her in oh say 3 weeks and Im happy about it. What I've done is I've tried keeping the friends I want closer I.E. Carl, Matt, Jim, Ed, and many many more. You're the friends I see having for a very long time and you always make me laugh and feel good about myself, even if you do call me fattie. You are all true friends and I thank you for that, you mean a lot to me.

Speaking of the ex, this is just starting to get creepy. So I never thought much about it until the other night when I was looking out my window and noticed her car. What are the odds of this... her new boyfriends name is Jake, he lives less then 200 feet away from me, and I can LITERALLY see her car and their bedroom window at night from my own window. That's fucked up. I was fucking here first and then she invades the neighborhood. Granted I know it's coincidence (maybe) but damn, it's hard enough hearing about her let alone seeing her car all the time! It reminds me of exactly what she made abundantly clear to me the last time we spoke, and that she's happier where she is and I'm nowhere near as good as the current Jake. Thank god I'm moving soon. It feels like god is trying his very best to interfer with my happiness... asshole.

Final exams are coming up, all three of mine are next week and one happens to be on the same day as the Ok Go Concert! So I'm hoping I can pull off some Flash powers and get that shit done ASAP. My final term paper is proving to be more difficult then I originally thought, I'm going to have to spend all tommorow night/Thursday morning on it to finish it. I can tell that I don't have enough material to cover the amount of words required, so... back to google and wikipedia. Thankfully I can research all day at work tommorow then write the rest of it afterwards, Im praying for 8 hours of sleep that night at least!

Well it's late and my head has been killing me all day from this headache that has yet to go away. Oh and if you havn't seen Hot Fuzz yet you must, it's the best movie EVER... THIS SHIT JUST GOT REAL!!!!!"

"event","Ok, so..... I finally went and seen it, Grindhouse. The movie that was sworn up and down to be better then 300, sex, and Ice cream combined. Does it live up the expectation?

HELL NO!

I went into Grindhouse critical, critical that I was going to get 3 hours of crap thrown at me. While in fact I was competely wrong! Let us split this movie up into the 2 movies it originally came to be...

Planet Terror: This movie was amazing, and I mean ""fuck ya"" amazing. Not only did I never look at my watch a single time I was literally all up in my chair saying ""oh no you didnt."" RR did a great job and I will say this is worth my money. The movie didn't even get bad until.... Quintin made an apperance. With his subpar acting and lame one liners, I was shocked RR had the balls to put him into this movie. At first I was excited to see him, I figured it would be interesting to see Quintin just die or something, but... no... he had lines, and they were horrible.

""I NEVER SEEN ME A ONE LEGGED STRIPPER BEFORE!!!! HARHARHARHAR"" WTF!?!?! seriously, I really hope this shitty ass character wasn't your doing Robert. I pray Quintin talked you into allowing him to make a quest star in the only movie that was actually good in Grindhouse.

Deathproof: This is the single worst movie I've ever fucking seen. It's stench was so fucking bad that it even required me to lower my IQ to comprehende why in the flying fuck a bad ass fucking stuntman with this awesome fucking car was taken off the road by fucking girls with a fucking attitude. Hell as the nigga carries a gun and shit no nigga is crazy enough to fucking fuck around with them. That shit is fucking wrong. Does that sound familiar? EVERY FUCKING FUCK FUCK FUCKING WORD IN THE MOVIE IS FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Or coming in one hell of a close second was NIGGA, Nigga please bust a cap in this ass and make it shut THE FUCK UP!

Why does everyone like this movie so much? Why? WHY!? Is it cool? Is it just Quintins lame excuse to mix both Bulletproof and She's the Man? Come the fuck on people, this movie was lame, hell people got up and left! THEY LEFT! Don't even get me started on the simple truth that I feel asleep during it. It's to long, to boring, no plot, nothing. Why does Mike like killing girls? We don't know, why is he the lamest character in the movie? We don't know! Oh wait... I do, because IT FUCKING BLEW ASS!!!

It's a good thing they didn't put this in the begining of Grindhouse or else a sad truth would have been one very low rating from the WORLD. 

People, this was a great concept, but 300 is so much better, SO MUCH BETTER then this. Save your cash, go watch The Reaping, and I'm sure you'll have a much better time. Cheers"

Through all your years you have provided me with fun, excitment, urine smelling hobos, loud frats beating eachother up, and of course the occassional parking ticket. Yet today I feel I did something truly wrong to have earned your hate. Please I beg of you make my water clear again and not smell like shit! All I wanted to do was get up, get a shower, and then go to work. Is that to much to ask for? I do pay your requested taxes, the penalties on parking, and put up with those hobos going through my garbage, so why do you deprive me of my water? Make it clear again and not spatter yellow and brown goo at me that smells like it's from a septic tank. This would be greatly appreciated! Go Spartans!

"event","This past week I've felt pretty shitty about myself, not in terms of ""oh my god I'm fat and ugly"" but rather in regards to how I've acted in the past.

Ever since Monday I've had a constant state of regret and disappointment in myself. I've always seen myself as a person who above all else sought reason and purpose in his actions but my meeting with my ex-girlfriend has left me wondering if I'm actually really a nice guy.

The things she told me I did, made me feel awful because they were exactly the same things she did to me, and I never wished those same feelings onto her. I regreted how things ended between us mostly because they ended on a note that nether of us wanted. It was a compelling stance of stubborness and hostility, most of the time that was pointless and artifical. I remember when both of us would fool the other and pretend they were happy when in all truthfulness we wern't. Even this past Monday I questioned as to whether what we told eachother was in fact the truth or what we thought the other wanted to hear... maybe even worse, we don't know what the truth is and we are trying to make it into a path divergent of the other just to get attention.

Regardless with all speculation aside I still feel horrible for putting someone through the same tourture I myself went through for months on end. I know for a fact that apoligies can only go so far and that blame should be equally shared, yet I still feel that I should take more of it then normal. 

I was dabbling with the thought of consequence, is it a consequence of her actions that lead this to happen to her? She did after all strike first blood. Yet if I think that way I'm not reasonable and I know reasonably one has to stop the repeat of revenge and draw a line and stand down, which was exactly what I did. I stood down and tried to leave even though at the time I felt in my heart I owed her every bit of revenge I could possibly give. Yet, over time it was a sort of karma. I felt that I unintentionally did onto her what she did onto me. I never planned it, I never wanted to go out of my way and attack her on all fronts and make her life hard and painful, I was still a victim of confussion and untrusting thoughts.

Honestly, can someone trust a person again once they broke that trust? What about truth and honesty? Can I honestly blame myself for causing someone pain when in fact I wasn't told about it until after it happened? Would she have cared differently knowing that I would have gone out of my way to help her in her times of need? Or is this her way of justifying her own guilty concious by making me look like a bad person... to of all people myself? I don't know, and it's confussing and painful to think of. I wonder if she knew that if I would have known her feelings I would have reacted much differently and that in fact how she held off telling me her true feelings provided me with the reenforcement needed to realize she didn't care and I needed to move on. Tears speak much louder to me then any word ever can.

Yet, there also comes the reality of the what was ""us"" or what now is. Today when I see her I feel almost everysingle emotion imaginable. I feel a sense of happiness and excitment, my hairs will literally stand on end, yet at that exact same time I'm disgusted and scared. When I'm around her she makes me feel worthless and unwanted, that nomatter what I do I can't do anything better. I'm just as likly to jump the table and kiss her as I am to hit her as hard as I possibly can and nether would make me feel better... I just can't get over that. It feels like I'm trapped, that no matter what I do I will never leave this state of mind. Granted I would never hit her lol, but it's a sense of frustration that I just can't get through her head and the only option I have left is to give up.

It feels when I'm around her she goes out of her way (sometimes she doesn't even need to say words) to show me how much better she is without me and that I will never match anything she will do in her life, that I'm this horrible person. Hell when we were together it felt that nomatter what I said no matter how hard I tried she would always get mad at me and make me feel so worthless that I just wasn't worth anything, that I had something to prove to her all the time. 

A harsh truth I never told her was once she left me and I started dating other people I was for once appreciated in means beyond what she ever did, and to go back to a girl who made you feel pain and trapped you in ""I feels"" was hard, hell it was impossible. I just flat out didn't like myself around her, and I'm only defensive around her, with no one else in this world do I feel this way around. It's only her that I feel hostile and that I'm going to be told that I'm wrong and that I did something wrong. 

To this day she never even apoligized for hurting me all those months ago, she would always tell me it was something she had to do. That she was compelled to leave me all alone like a mother abandoning her child and expecting it to be all better when she got back. With all her qualities as a person, she has one huge fault, pride. She was so proud to be who she was, she was a working girl, supperior in some sense to everyone else because she had to earn it herself. She of course will never admit it, but anyone who knows her knows there's something about her that can make you feel less around her, and that's it. She's prideful, and because she's prideful I will never expect an apoligy, or at least a clear one. Maybe I'm being unfair and she has tried in some sense without taking all the blame to apoligize, but I know in my memory she has never come straight out and told me she was wrong and she was sorry. Sometimes being right (even to me) costs us more in the end because you're sacrificing the only thing you have left, feeling.

What am I getting at in all of this? Should I take blame and apoligize for the things that happened to my ex-girlfriend long after she left me? Granted yes she tried to make amends, but to me she didn't try hard enough and prove to me she loved me, I just felt that I was there and I was the last hope. Being with so many guys and then months later come back at the very moment I had finally moved on? Maybe of all people in the world she should turn inward and blame herself for what happened. I am only human, I still have feelings and they were no doubt exploited.

Many of you out there told me long ago that any guilt I felt should be laughed at because she had this coming. That in fact I'm not a horrible person, that I was a very good person to her and tried one of the hardest things a person can do, go back to the person who betrayed them and start anew. I never asked for any of this to happen, it was ironically forced on me very unwillingly. Yet the same people who tell me that also look to me to forgive, which I do more then willingly. I don't like holding grudges, they are unhealthy and careless. What I do like though is making a person happy and at that making that same person happy to be around me. This I think I do very well.

Anna told me many times Monday night that I wasn't a bad person, that in fact I was the exact opposite and I was a victim of remorse. A bad person wouldn't have cared what happened to her, but in fact I was severly concerned about her well-being. 

Maybe it shows the signs of a good-man when he can cry at his shame or regret and try to make it better, to which I did plenty of that Monday night. Is this a sign of a good person?

Regardless I know for once I've been appreciated beyond ends I can remember and Anna makes me happy. I can't sit here in my little chair typing about how much I miss someone when in fact I know I have a great girl with me right now who will literally go out of her way to make me happy. I love that, and I love her. I don't miss my ex as much as I regret how it ended. All I can do now is try and build a relationship with Anna in the imagine I've always tried, and I think with Anna's character she would never do the same things to me. Of all the people in the world I know Anna is selfless and gives far more then she receives. Most of all she makes me feel like I actually mean something in her life and if I left it would devestate her, and that sense of need matters greatly to me.

There, my thoughts are on paper, and I feel much better about it. I've always believed you are what other people think you are, and that identity is classified and given by others, not by yourself. I would hate to be remembered as a bad person, I've tried so hard to be there for friends and family in need. Although I was hurt by my ex, I would still to this day help even her in her times of need if the calling ever came. Revenge to me I come to question sometimes if it's in my nature, I've always been so forgiving."

Ok now onto life.... 

Anna and I are of course great, we still to this very day havn't had a single fight, not even a disagreement. We always seem to get along and want eachothers company. I can already tell that summer is going to be extremly hard on both of us being 2 hours apart for almost three months. Granted we both have cars, but work and school never lets up its relentless assaults. Regardless we are happy together and I couldn't be happier myself. I'm glad I held out such hope for 2007, so far it's proving to be a far better year then last...

I love video games, especially when they have Grace Park in them... because I love Grace Park.

<img src=""http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A9gnMiQsRQ9Gcq8AYTmjzbkF;_ylu=X3oDMTA4NDgyNWN0BHNlYwNwcm9m/SIG=12hrul962/EXP=1175492268/**http%3A//img400.imageshack.us/img400/9959/grace61024x7689ue.jpg"">

See how hot she is? Isn't it a reason to buy Command and Conquer 3? I thought so and it turns out that on top of having Grace Park in it, it is also quite possibly the best RTS I've ever played! That's saying something seeing that all I do is buy PC games and play them in my limited off time. EVE is getting so fucking boring, I think it's about time to finally sell off another character, and then venture forth and find yet another game. I just can't get my spaceship cravings with anyother game whether it be Sword of the Stars, Birth of the Federation, or Battlefront 2! I just want a game as close to Battlestar Galactica as I can possibly find and EVE is the only game in existence that has so far given me that. I just hate how political it is sometimes! I just want to fucking kill stuff!!!!!

So, speaking of Battlestar Galactica... it has finally ended... and it has left me on the biggest cliffhanger of all time and it's driving me nuts. The show won't be due back on air until 2008 which means when it comes again I'll be on the verge of graduating college! WTF!? The only hope I had was from Nate telling me that this fall they are supposivly releasing a movie and if that's the case GODS REJOICE because I need something more! DAMN YOU RON MOORE! GIVE ME MORE!

Oh speaking of which, if any of you out there love me buy me this....

In other news Wendy has offically become Jakes new roommate! We go tommorow to submit our applications for our future love nest. I'm sure you're all wondering out there... can Wendy resist how amazingly hot and attractive Jake is? The answer is yes... but only at first. I'm sure we'll make great roommates, after all she ""is"" Carl's girlfriend which means I hopfully will see more of Carl! That can of course be a bad thing thinking about it, I'm trying to give up my lustful fantasies of meat cramming Carl... Yeah for us Wendy!

Have I told you how much I absolutly fucking hate the Avalon Cooperative? I can only hope and pray these fucktards all get some form of downsyndrome one day and then proceed to sell themselves into experimental drug use programs resulting in hidious decaying scabbs and rotting flesh....

Well that's about it, but before I go, I have to leave you all with this little tigbit of video footage...

Well things in life have been going better then normal... if not the best. School is always difficult but still effective and work is always busy. Lets run it down... and yes Heath, it's the same shit different month, so go ahead and skip the rest :-p

First things first, I've meet someone incredibly amazing. Her name is Anna, she has taken me completely off guard and we are very happy together. I wasn't expecting to fall this hard in love but I can honestly say this relationship will last. We've been together almost a month now and have dated for nearly 2. I know she is reading this and I want to tell you how happy you make me. My only problem is she doesn't have any livejournal friends! Guys I beg of you all, add her to your friends list so she isn't so lonelly!

<img src=""http://img168.imageshack.us/img168/5683/n2344558366107415138va3.jpg"">

School is getting really hard... and it's driving me nuts. Granted I can take it but my only quarll right now is with a professor who is writing bad exams and still holding the class accountable for the results. I've taken it upon myself to petition his exam policy to the head of the department and asking for a complete review of his last exam based on the fact for the first 20 minutes of reading through the exam we found several errors, roughly resulting in possibly 15-25% of the exam as faulty or questionable questions. That percentage would raise over all grades and reduce the amount of failures in the class. The Professor had already told us he'd only give us 4 additional points to the exam only for those present at the class. Well that's not fair, he needs to go through and fix his errors and make it so no one is penalized for his mistakes. This should be fun, I can't wait to be the one to stand up to him out of a class of 137 students.

My home life is still miserable. I'm glad that there's only one more month I have to pay for and then I'm out of there. I was recently fined massive amounts of money inside our house for uncompleted jobs and I of course am fighting it. So I reviewed our contract policy and discovered... hey, the only way to appeal these things is to have house meetings... we don't have those anymore. The last meeting we had was in Janurary, and here it is March. We are suppose to have them every 2 weeks.... well.... thats not cool. So I then decided, I'm not paying money for things I did, and now Im going to attack them using their own system. So I wrote a letter to their over seers and begining next week our houses officiers should be in the shit outta luck stage of their tennencys. Basically the officers who fine me or manage the house get stripped of their power and are replaced by executive people from other houses! Sound fun? Yep, it is. I did it all anoynomously so I can't be caught and scrutinized... just yet. If I need to I will in due time, but for the mean time I hate it, they will pay, and now that they caught on to my MAC blocking methods. I had to start using something new and more interesting... did you know in LINKSYS routers you can block MAC address's at different times of the day? Oh god, it's awesome lol. I'll program the router to kick people off using that program and I don't think anyone would have the balls to touch it... it's too complicated.

LOL, I did it again in EVE, I stole their hangers. I'm an asshole, they hate me right now and I even decided to leave the corp. So they are going to hate me more when they realize the corp that's taking me now is in Goonswarm! Finally back on the front line with a good corporation, this should be fun!

Alright guys that's about it for now, More later to come I'm sure of it! See ya!"

"event","When I was growing up I always strived to be better than my siblings. Call it a sibling rivalry just to see who could be more successful then the other and so on. Well it's safe to say that I easily won that fued between all but one of my siblings.

I have two sides to my family, my mother and my father. On my fathers side there is myself, my brother and my step-sister who might as well be my sister. My sister has done well for herself and is in her second year at Central Michigan University and I couldn't be more proud of her. While on the other hand there's my mothers side with my older step brother who is now serving a year sentance for attempted murder at the Ingham County Jail.

You can obviously see a large difference between the two sides seeing that one is in jail and the other one isn't.

Yet they are all irrelivent when it comes to my younger biological brother who has shown his quality as not only a criminal, but a very irresponsible and unreasonable person. He's committed numerous crimes and serious offenses, he even spent Christmas EVE inside a prison cell. Out of all he's done... I'm quite easily shocked at his latest offense, running away to Flordia. My brother has offically failed the 10th grade and is so involved and addicted to drugs that's he has resorted to sell them to get his fix. He's been thrown out of my fathers house and looks to be being thrown out of my mothers when he returns to Lansing... all by the age of 16.

My parents after spending thousands of dollars on legal fees fighting and defending his last two breaking and enterings have finally given up and will be having him placed under arrest when he gets back home and thrown into a Juvinelle detention center later this week and he doesn't know it yet. I guess to my surprise this isn't the first time he's ran away from home, and the recent news that he's not going to be able to complete high school at his current pace wasn't very sounding ether.

Bottomline in all of this, out of all the male siblings in my family, I'm now the only one who has never been convicted of a felony and will now be the only one to complete a high school degree. What's more is out of all my siblings in my family, I'm the only one who hasn't been arrested and fined... scary...

I half wonder why I'm pursuing Criminal Law in the first place... I might feel used come 10 years from now. I hate being the only responsible member of my immediate family.

My parents yesterday gave me in writing the position of executor of their estates when they pass away. They even went as far as to give me controlling share over what is to be given to my other brothers and how assets will be distributed. They have basically given me... everything. They see it that I as being the only fair and reasonable child will divide up their assets at the best of my own discretion and help my brothers when that responsibility is passed on to me. I couldn't say no, it was already in writing but I don't know if I personally want that responsibility to determine who gets what in my family and if I want to be placed in a position of sole ownership of everything. Thankfully my father gave me sister 33% of their estate leaving me with the remaining 66% but even still I'm the person who determines what is to be given in regards to that 33%.

I find it amazing that in the end my family has placed great trust and faith in my unwavering pursuit of a graduate degree in Law. My father told me today that out of the entire family I'm the only one who has gone to such extensive lengths to better my situation in life and get a higher education. That out of all my cousins and relatives I'm still the only child to pursue a profession. This scares me again, I don't want to be the only person in my family who attempts to obtain a degree of higher education! I always imagined giving my children a good family setting with my relatives and siblings enjoying the comforts that I would enjoy. Yet I can see why it's called the American ""dream.""

So... how do my brothers view this? I'm afraid to find out, I was just given their inheritance and now it's up to me to decide what I want them to have. I wouldn't be happy if I were them, ether of them. Far as I'm concerned, I just got all of the assets my parents worked so hard for, and I don't share with people undeserving of such things.

My younger brother has offically messed up his life, and has effectivly been disowned by my parents. I can only hope a couple months behind bars will eliviate his position in life and make him realize what life truly gives to those who don't abid by its rules. If not, as many people in my past have learned, I am not a forgiving person when it comes to breaking my trust."

"event","I've been at this college thing for damn near 4 years now and I still have nothing to show for it.... until now. Recently I made an appointment through an advisor at LCC to get an idea about what kind of Associates Degree I can get with my combined credits from LCC and MSU, and it turns out I'm entitled to get three associates degrees!

Associates in Liberal Arts, General Associates, and Associates in Political Science.

So come Spring of next year looks like I'll have three degrees that actually show I did something in college, and that makes Jake a happy panda!

On top of that! I got a call this morning from the Ingham County Prosecutors Officer setting up a formal interview for my internship for Spring semester!!!!!!! You have no fucking idea how amazing that was to actually get a call from the Prosecutors office as an intern! So I have that going on as well! Field experience! FIELD EXPERIENCE!

Yet it doesn't end there.... I will also be going for a second bachlors degree through MSU only needing 30 more credits to get a degree in Criminal Justice. So fun fun. Im just flat out happy today knowing that Im gaining ground with my education!

Now...... how can I balance 25 credits for next semester? That will be a challenge."

"event","Wow, what a shitty past August, and September isn't looking to much better, but, I'm trying to adapt to change.

So lately as a large amount of you know my life has been really shitty lately. I've been going through a lot of emotional tramma and now I will be seeing a therapist, which helps out a lot. I've talked to him over the phone and he told me a couple things I need to do to get my life back on track, and all of which Im very happy for.

First things first, Sam, gotta go. He explained to me that I derived a great deal of my happiness from her, and I need to let her go, so I'm no longer allowed any kind of contact with her. He explained that the only way I will ever heal is if I rid my life of Sam altogether and only then will I be able to begin the healing process. So I decided to block/stealth all her names, blocked all e-mail and I'm on the fence about blocking her number, but that might be a little to extreme.

Second off, now I need to begin focusing on me. Dating was fun, but at the same time it was really bad. He explained that the more I see other women the worse off I will be. I'm just not ready, and because of that I need to stay out of a relationship and focus on my own happiness. Which I thought to myself, how can I do that? I can write, I can play games, watch movies. Just do anything that will allow me to keep myself occupied and interested. So I finally did what I've wanted to do for so long, I enrolled myself back into Karate, and I start this Friday and should be going 3 times a week. I'm very excited, now I can get back into shape and rebuild my self confidence.

Third, no more suicide thoughts. Any idea or attempts just set off what he described as an ""emotional bomb."" In which the person I want to hurt the most isn't just hurt, but everyone is. He also explained to me how it appears Sam is heartless and wouldn't even be effected by anything of this sort. So I need to forget about getting revenge through death, because even with revenge, assurance is through knowing what happens afterwards, and if I'm dead, I won't know the effect. So, suicide isn't even logical.

Forth, and most important, DRINK IN MODERATION. My first step to this was giving up all my alochol. It was a sad day to see my merlot leave my refridgerator, but I need it to. He told me the occassional drink is ok, but drinking to get drunk is just unacceptable. So, no more drinking to get drunk, moderation is now the key.

Fifth, I need to understand that life will go on. He put so much stress on the fact that although right now my life feels bad, I am going to get better and that in a year from now I will look back on this and learn from my mistakes. He told me how I will be sad, how I will lose sleep, that it's all part of the natural grieving process, and that it will take almost a year to fully function again with happiness. So, I have to focus on the future, and not dwell on the past. To do this he recommended sleeping pills for the nighttime, he said keep them temporarily and take them for the nights I can't sleep and then I won't dwell on my times past. So far it's working, I get sad towards the end of the night, but.... I can at least sleep.

Finally, spend as much time with family and friends as I can. So I've been getting in touch with all my old friends and so far that's doing well. My family and I have been getting really close to, and Im glad they are becoming supportive. Although my father doesn't want me to seek therapy, my mother is overwhelmingly pushing for it.

Outside of that, my life in school is going smoothly, I'm happy about it. I just wish it wasn't 11 hours long.

Ill have a spotlight ten update soon, but writing about everything I was told to me helps me remember just why I need to do this, and maybe I can finally move on with my life."

"event","Ok new and interesting things are happening in my life.... so far August has been the most changing month in my life.....

Job:

Well lately I've been receiving shit hours from Game Hits... about 2 days a week. Now to most that's just bad... but for me I'm actually enjoying it! I have a lot more time on my hands and for this summer I've actually had constant days off and been able to sleep in! Of course this changes next week and from the sounds of it I'll be getting my Best Buy job back. I know a lot of you miss my discount but never fear, I should hopfully have it back within a couple weeks. There was only one problem with getting it back, and that's I don't have a required day in the week available. It looks like I'm suppose to have Wednesday as a required available day to work there but I don't because of Game Hits. So because of that they have to take an exception to my employment.... but then again I have weekends off and that was very appealing to managment. Oh well, if I don't get it I won't be heart broken, I have student loans taking care of bills for the most part and what I make at the job is what I use as spending money. As for the Game Hits, if I want to I can get more hours again... but that's if I want to. Who knows, I just might.

Music:

Music wise I've been listening to a lot of Snow Patrol and misc bands through a website called .977alt.com. Actually have some good music, it's normally on my PC at least 12 hours a day, and that's because I like to party. CD wise I've picked up A Panic at the Disco's new one and Snow Patrol's new one, however, Panic's blows major ass, Snow's is really good if you like sad depressing rock. Still though nothing beats Incubus, they are still the best music to go fast to.

Parties:

Well it feels like everynight is now a party. Every night I keep getting phone calls from Jen and Dayne to go out and play pool and do some much ""needed"" drinking. Of course, after my 21st I've barely been able to drink anything except wine, and I drink wine only because I admire the taste. Party wise though I'm becoming better and better at pool and I think I can now contend with the likes of Dayne and Clint. I'll probably go to Rei's party this weekend to just hang out and enjoy the company of those there. Outside of that it's welcome week in East Lansing, so you know I'll be out there!

Home Life:

I hate living alone, I really do. I forgot how lonelly it was to basically come home to just a fish tank and no one else to share your bed with. However it does have its perks. I can keep it somewhat clean and not have to worry about someone elses crap. Secondly I enjoy the fact that I have my own bathroom and can finally stretch out in my bed. Ed is a great landlord, he has been a great guy to rent from, and I hope we can keep this up. Also, I love the fact that I have what I eat in my refridgerator! 2 liters of pop, wine, frozen pizzas, and a lot of Ramen noodles. The basics of life.

Wisdom:

A couple weeks ago I thought my life was over, that the loss of Sam had just completely devastated my life and I had nothing to live for. Today I feel much different about it. Classes start in a week and now I'm meeting new and interesting people, so I understand now that losing those you love is apart of life and a lesson you can one day teach to your children.

Money:

Well I've finally gotten back into Counsel games. I've picked up FFVII Dirge of Cerberus and Dead Rising. I love them both but I need to stop spending money on games like that. Not to mention I finally had to buy a new cell phone, and that cost a couple hundred, so my free spending money is really limited right now. However, with student loans now in my bank account, I'm not to worried, I'm going to be able to afford everything much much easier.

Video Games:

I don't have to much time on my hands, however I still take the occassional moment to fall into the love of a video game. I really want to play FFVII Dirge more, but just havn't found the time. I'll probably start to get into it come this weekend, I'll have a couple days off in a row. Until then it's Cell Phone tetris.

Friends:

I need to apoligize to a couple people first off. Jim, I need to say I'm sorry, I havn't seen you a lot lately and I'm not sure if that's making you angry or apathetic. Don't think I've forgotten about you, I've just been very busy, you can probably ask Ed and see that I'm never home. Next off I need to apoligize to Dayne and Amanda, both of them are driving me nuts. Since their seperation it's basically forcing me to choose between the both of them and they both equally want my time as much as the other... which leads me to Matt. Hey buddy, sorry again, I know we havn't had the chance to hang out nearly as much as we used to. You just need to stop working so much! Outside of that I've made a couple new ones. Dave and Clint (both from pockets) come out with us a lot now, and they are both really cool people to hang out with. I'm loving Trippers, I can't beat the prices or the pool, probably one of my favorite places to spend my time now. Not to mention I've become such a familiar face the waitresses are now remembering me as ""that hilarious drunk guy!"" So gotta love getting a reputation!

Romance:

So the era of Sam and I has come to an end, maybe in the far distant future we will both grow up and be able to overcome our drastic differences, however until then it's quite apparant that we have grown to become two completetly different people, and because of that what we both fell in love with 4 years ago is just not there anymore. We've diverged on two different paths, and because of that we just don't mend together anymore... even though I will always love her and she will always have a large claim in my heart, any logical person will understand that compatibility and love are in no way alike, but are both needed in a relationship. So in the mean time Jake's been playing the ""game."" I've met a lot of interesting women, some psycho, some beautiful, some just flat our anoying. Of course though there are the ones that you just can't get and makes you want them more. So over this past month I've been on several dates, some of which you guys don't know of, and others you all know to much of. So in the mean time I'm still single, I've started talking to this one girl on a daily basis and I think we are starting to really hit it off, however nothing offical. You of course, my fans and over all frinds will know about it when it becomes something more.

Future:

Right now I'm in the hunt to finish off school and at the same time find someone who wants to spend the rest of her life with me. I'm hoping I find that person sooner rather then later, I hate being alone in life. I hope I'm a good guy, that people actually want to spend time with me, so I'm pulling on the notion that I am worth something to someone. In the mean time I guess I'll have to take life one day at a time, but until then I'm hoping I can at least find happiness in something else."

"event","I miss my old website ""Tales of a Lackey"" with all my old customer complaints. Well, I have another one to add to that one...

So a couple of people walk in with a couple wrapped DVD's, Jason X and Nightmare on Elm Street. I tell them I can't take wrapped DVD's, for obvious reasons (possible stolen.) So they humbley say ""alright I understand"" and I look through the ones that wern't wrapped, and it basically came down to about a $1 a piece (real shitty ones.) Of course like any logical person they say no and walk out and that seems to be the end of that.

About an hour goes by and a new woman walks in with the same exact 2 DVD's and wants to sell them to me (except unwrapped so it's all good,) so I look them up and as I'm looking them up those same two people walk in shortly after and I quote the woman about $1 a piece, I mean seriously, I don't want these DVD's. The woman again takes them back and leaves again with those same two people, no problem.

Another hour goes by and the same couple yet AGAIN walk into the store and show me new DVDs with the same exact two DVD titles. I quote them again, except this time the fat woman of the bunch explodes ""I'M NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN! THAT IS AN OUTRAGE! I CAN'T BELEIVE YOU! I CAN GET MORE IN EAST LANSING!"" So I try to maintain the moment (other customers were in the store.. yes, some were laughing) and she storms out in a fit.

ANOTHER HOUR goes by and then the boyfriend walks in with just those two DVD's, nothing else this time. He will humbley accept $2 for both of them, well me being the vindictive son of a bitch I am say nah, I don't want them anymore, so he walks out... slightly depressed.

I swear, these people walk in every hour and this time, just that woman walks in. She throws the DVD's on the counter and says I want to sell these. Of course I say no, don't want them anymore. She then starts to get angry ""Why not!? I wasted gas to get here expected $2 so I want $2."" I start to laugh, and I can tell she doesn't like that. Now keep in mind, there are no customers in the store this time, so it's open season....

(to the best of my memory)

Jake: ""Wait wait, I thought you could get more in East Lansing?""
Woman: No Response""
Jake: ""Knowing you can get more for those DVD's I can't POSSIBLY take those off your hands""
Woman: ""You told me $1 a piece, so I expect $1 a piece.""
Jake: ""Nah, I'm good, I don't want them, I can choose who I do business with, and besides, it's ONLY $2, that's like 200 horse rides at Meijer.""
Woman: ""Do you want to keep your job!? You will pay me what I want for these right now, keep your smart ass tongue in your mouth!""

LOL, now it was funny, she was getting pretty pissed off at this moment, all evil eyed and red faced, like a Giant angry Cool Aid man, except larger and wider.

Jake: ""Nope, I'm still good, go back to East Lansing, I hear they are craving Jason X right now, must be a hot seller.""
Woman: ""If you don't buy these DVD's from me I'll tell all my friends that this place is a bad place to do business with and go out of my way to get you fired.""
Jake: LAUGHING

She begins to storm out again

Jake: ""You have a good day!""
Woman: ""IM NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN! NEVER!""
Jake: ""Oh god your a blast, come back again!""

Moral of the story: Never be mean to someone you need something form later, they probably wont help you with it."

"event","Well it's about time for an update, some big things have happened...

First things first I now have my own place to live. Even though as I write this my apartment is ready to be slept in, a very large part of me wants to go back to my old apartment, which is now Sams apartment, and sleep there, putting off the whole ""change"" issue. It's going to feel odd sleeping in bed by myself again, I'm so used to sleeping in bed with Sam I almost forgot how to sleep in bed by myself. I'm sure I'll quickly remember... I'll have more then a foot of bed from now on.

My apartment, which was once full of empty space is now filled corner to corner with things I didn't even remember having. All of which is making it more difficult to get a fish tank stand, but regardless I will be getting one, I desperatly need one. I think things are going to go along very nicely here. Ed, my landlord, friend, and kind of roommate (he lives in the other side of the duplex) I hope will get along nicely. I don't know how to interact with him now... guess I'll just treat the situation as if he's not there.

This break up has gotten very hard for me. Losing someone you deeply love isn't like walking through the park. I don't know how to really act around her when we see one another. We still are friends, and I know she loves me greatly like I do her, but still, how do you act to someone who broke your heart? I guess I just need some time, a little bit of room and now I have plenty of it. I just don't want to make that big mistake of losing her if I take my time. I know that in life there is always someone better out there, and I think I found one of my better matches, but still I don't know if that can be said for her, if I am one of those better matches. She goes out a lot, which makes her odds of finding someone new incredibly high. So what can I do myself? It's a dilemma I don't know how to confront, and it hurts, because for once in my life I'm faced with a problem that I can't find a solution to.

So now I've basically quit all MMORPG's including EVE. Thankfully with EVE, I can sell my characters via ebay and right now my main character is setting at about $100 with another 5 days to go. Jim, Dayne, and Ed are quitting with me, so it will feel good knowing that we can make some money, especially Jim, who is in line to make about $1500 for both of his characters, if not more. I should make about $500 when all mine sell, and that will spell new PC for me.

Well I guess I should go and finish unpacking my shit, almost done, and I want to get it done tonight if possible so I can prepare for my exam tommorow. I just hope that I can be happy here, a life without Sam is a painful one, but I'm putting some hope on alcohol being that cure. Cheers."

"event","I'm not going to go through and make a spotlight ten, mostly because I can't think of 10 subjects that can individually interest people. Most of my happenings involved blured lines, and it's never a clear cut board of understanding ether.

For starters, yes, I'm out at the end of July.... right around 2 weeks. I've decided that I don't want to wait for my lease to expire for Sam and I to break up and go our seperate ways, so instead I'm going to be moving out in the end of July and give Sam the apartment for a month and then she herself will be moving out.

Things at home have been doing well. Sam and I havn't been fighting even though we will be seperating soon. I'm very happy that we are able to handle this situation as adults rather then children. The only thing I'm not looking forward to is moving out.... that's going to blow major ass.... I have a lot of shit to move out... and I mean a lot.

School is going very well, I can't complain in the least bit. I so far have been holding a good solid 4.0 in both my summer classes which is good because they are god awful hard. I did the math and if I can get 4.0's in both classes plus during fall get a couple 4.0's I should be able to raise my GPA well up and over 3.5 which would allow me to apply for a Governor internship, or even possible a senate internship. Right now I need to focus on writing my paper which I'm having a hard to getting myself motivated for. Writing on Justice Scalia using a professionals analytical argument is hard for any student... not to mention using legal citing. If it wasn't for work I'd say I'd have it done by now, but as of right now I will have worked 37 hours this week plus school, and I still have Saturday to go... man do I want a day off.

I started shopping for a new car and I discovered something about the car market... Honda Civics are damn near impossible to get. I want one of those for their look and their estimated EPA Millage, and what the guy told me at the dealership was this..... it's about a month for a new one..... and as for used ones... good luck. It hurts to say it but I'm actually stuck with my current car, I couldn't sell it even if I wanted to. I checked out the independent market and discovered that most American automobiles are flooding the market and an increase in foreign demand has skyrocketed. That doesn't shock me, most foreign cars are the better picks, and not to mention nearly double the amount of miles per gallon then American cars. So I have to start paying some major money on my car to trade it in at demand value right now, which is around $4000. It hurts to say it but I really want a new car.

So Dayne has finally quit World of Warcraft, and to make sure he didn't go back he deleted both of his characters. I have to say I'm quite proud of him for doing it, I'm sure that took a lot of effort to quit. It's like a drug, you get hooked and it's hard to stop... the good thing on this addiction is that it gets boring after a couple years. Regardless it still costs a lot of money to do though. So now Dayne has more cash... and time.

I really don't know what else to say... I'm just going to go and read a book and tell the rest of you guys to do the same... it's worth it."

"event","As I see it, if the White man can steal the Indians land, Carl can steal Russ's monthly update idea, then gosh darn it I can to, and I'm going to improve on it by making a 11th instalation!!!!!!!!!!!!! So in yo face Russ and Carl....

1. Job: It is sad but true, I am now going on my fifth year of employment at Game Hits. Whether that be a bad thing or a good thing is questionable. I've held a steady job for a long time, I've made decent money and I do get paid to play video games all day, not to mention Shawn is a pretty easy guy to work for. My main problem is motivation. It's hard to go to work now realizing that I really want a more meaningful job in life, or at least one that has a lot more responsibility. Game Hits is a responsibility, but it's not a major one. I look at Sam and I often get envious of her, seeing that she has a position of influence and importance, all while making more money then me. Granted she works her ass off, but she still has a job with purpose, I on the other hand listen to people asking me how much we give for Madden 2004 everyday.... gets kind of repeatitive.

2. EVE: So I finally defeated my rival corp for the third time in a row. We stole their starbase in what could be classified as one of the greatest thefts of all time. We forced their corp to disband in what was one of the greatest achievments of the game for me. The Tetra Gammatron now is hated by A LOT of corporations, and I mean A LOT. So much so that Jim and I are going to be forced to form an alternate corporation in order to recruit. In the mean time I've purchased another account and moved my spy into a new corporation all while staying in close contact with the Crimson Knights (Rival Corp we defeated.) By mid July, late June I should be able to get my hands on yet another POS and snatch that one up and yet again get another working POS. I'm hoping things go well like they did before, but I don't know 100% because it's always a gamble with EVE, everything takes forever.

3. Sam: For those of you who don't know Sam and I were able to work things out. We were on the rocks for about a week and although she doesn't see it I feel we seperated for a good week. I came to my senses and realized, we both realized, that we didn't want to seperate. It tour both of us up pretty badly, me especially. In the end though it helped out our relationship a lot, and I could see it being a good thing in the future if we ever need to do it again. It really makes us appreciate one another that much more. She's a great ""gal"" so to say but I really hate it when she takes my side of the bed including her own, and she knows EXACTLY what I'm talking about.

4. Apartment: So I'm starting to wonder where to move out to. We have less then 2 months left on our lease and I really want to move to a better area of town, one with less.... how can I put this....... lower class people? People around here are ether illegal aliens like my next door neighbors, German, ghetto, or my favorite white trash. I just can't stand the people living in this building! It makes me want to burn the place down each time I step into its repulsive framework. You're suppose to enjoy where you live at, yet here I'm finding myself wanting to shoot everyone who walks in, especially my downstairs neighbors who obviously didn't beleive in birth control.

5. Wisdom: I've been spending less time inside and more time outside with friends. It's a good thing, but damn is it expensive.

6. Hobbies: So I've really gotten into Pool a lot lately. I'm finding myself down at pockets everyother night at least with Dayne. I'm greatly improving my game but still I'm nowhere near as good as Dayne when it comes to skill. I played in my first tournment tonight and lost as expected, but almost eliminated Dayne off one of my most impressive shots ever taken. I know when Dayne seen me sink my last ball in and have a clear shot on the 8 he was sweating bullets. Fortuantly for Dayne the cut I needed to win the game I missed and ended up scratching thus giving him the victory. Regardless my next tournment is Thursday and I'm looking forward to it.

7. Movies: So X-men 3 wasn't as good as I was expecting, but still surprisingly entertaining. I enjoyed what I seen, and even so enjoyed it a lot more when the humor as played into it. Regardless the movies coming out are so so exciting. The only real movie I'm counting down to is Nacho Libre, which I feel will finally give me the material needed to make most of my jokes more funny and humerous. Back on subject though I need to see another good movie, because Cars just isn't going to cut it... never.

8. Friends: I've been spending a lot of time with friends lately. Dayne and I have been seeing one another on an almost daily basis and Jim and I talk at least once a day. I see a lot of Carl and I have to say it's so much better then playing WoW. I forgot how much fun it was to get together with friends and just shoot the breeze. Even the occassional text message from Matt is nice. Thanks guys for being my friend, I know it's hard, but you know it pays off in the end.

9. School: School is going great this year. Granted I havnt taken my first exam yet, but the reading I've been requested to do is very interesting stuff. Learning about the constitution and our forfathers is the most entertaining theme I've ever read. I just wish the book didn't require me to keep up with the class or else I'd probably read these books on my own on my free time. I'm looking to get a 4.0 in my history class this year, I don't see why I cant do it. I need one badly, I havn't have a single 4.0 at MSU yet, and that's kind of scary.

10. Future: Well things are going to be looking up and down at the same time as I progress through the summer months. My financial situation is going to be getting grimmer and grimmer as I approach August. I unfortuantly have some big bills I'm going to have to deal with soon and I'm not working nearly as much because of summer classes as I normally would. Still student loans will keep it so I can make my bills, just not make them and still have a thousand left over in my bank account. Other then that summer is here, and it means the time to lay back and have fun.

11. Birthday: I've been racking my brain on to what I want to do for my 21st birthday. I've been told I'll be going to gay bars, and strip clubs. Still my birthday falls on a Thursday and it just so happens it falls on my finals week to. So I won't be able to party on my 21st, instead I'll be forced to enjoy the joyfullness of mass study and text analization.

"event","Hey guys, I just wanted to say thank you all who have been there for me these past couple days. Dayne, Shawn, Jim, Heath, Amanda, Carl... somewhat, and most of all you Keasto, you have been a great friend these past couple days.

An update in regards to Sam and I. There's no question we are going to seperate. She will be moving out in the next couple weeks or later who knows(I told her move out when she wanted, she can stay as long as she wants and she knows that.) We both are going to stay together as a couple BUT keep the option to see other people open. We feel seperating will encourage us to see others, even though we really like the idea of being together but living apart. That might work out, who knows :).

Both Sam and I are best friends. We still sleep in the same bed, she's still regulating my Friday and Saturday nights, we are just as we always were. We both don't want to seperate but we understand it's needed.

Things might get strange later on when we do start seeing other people but nether of us are interested in making our love life a drama film. We're trying to be adults about it, and most of all trying to make something more of our lives. If things work out in favor of us being together, then it shall be so. If Sam sees another guy and I kill them both in their sleep and blame it on Russ, oh well. If I meet up with a Carls hot sister and screw her in the ass, that's life. We don't know what's going to happen, but we know we won't have sex with Carl.

Again guys thank you all for your help and support. You guys are helping both of us through a trying time that I feel we have come to a mutual understanding over. Chin up guys, things will get better."

"event","Well gang very difficult and trying times are ahead for me and Sam. To those of you who have not heard (which I imagine isn't a lot) Sam and I will be going thorugh a trial seperation in a few months and will not be moving back in together. We both are in aggreance that we both need to see other people (More so me) before we make the big decision if we truly want to spend the rest of our lives together. 

Don't get me wrong, we are great together. We truly love one another but we need to test other waters before we take another step. We will forever remain friends if we decide to stay single or find someone else. She has been my closest and most trusted friend these past few years and I will cheerish the memories I've had with her, they are some of my happiest.

Seeing that I'm leaving the comfort of my living situation I've taken a big step and decided to move out on my own and get a place for myself instead of having a roommate. I know most of you are sighing in your chairs reading that (Especially you Matt, sorry buddy) but I don't think I want another roommate unless it's Sam. We got along excellent together, never had problems with apartment living or bill paying, yet still, I want my own place. A place where I can come home to and not worrying about free balling it around the apartment (which I plan to do.)

Tonight I went over to Ed's place (Friend of Jim) and we LANed some Warhammer together (awesome game BTW) and Ed started talking about his back apartment he wanted to rent out. I of course got curious and he showed me around. For lack of a better word it was perfect. The place was in rough shape right now (It's being remodeled) but the asking price on rent was just unbeatable, plus it's basically a bachlor pad. My only neighbor is Ed (Who is a really cool guy, we get along great) and the houses next door. I get my own deck, literally a deck and basement. I've decided that's where I'm going to set up shop at and I'm going to pay him quite a few months in advance to insure the place is mine. 

The location is splendid to, it's located near downtown Lansing, more so by Game Hits so it's less then a mile from work. Plus it's off I-496 which is right down the road from campus. So it's a ideal place for me to move into.

Best part is it wont be ready until July, early August, right around the time my lease expires on my apartment!

Here's another good thing. If Sam and I decide to get back together there's no contract and it's a great place for the two of us to move into. Smaller then our current apartment but rent would basically be 40% less then what we pay total everything. So I'd think she'd be willing to sacrifice that for some of the gains.

I'm excited. Granted I'm going to miss the place I live at right now. It was a great place to live at, but I need to think about what's going to happen after the fact.

My summer classes begin this coming Monday with three very un-fun classes. All three total 10 credits which makes it a full time term over the course of 3 months. I have class pretty much everyday. Not fun. Still I need these to graduate on time and stay ahead of the curve.

Game Hits is doing good despite it being our slowest season. I've taken some drastic cuts in pay because of my commision based employment (which is ok, student loans cover the rest.) but it does hit a sore spot sometimes. I've been trying to keep my savings above $2000 but I don't htink I can, looks like it's going to dip down in the $1000 range this coming month, which blows.

Today marked the offical day that all my childhood dogs have died. My last two dogs from my fathers family have died making it a total of 4 dogs in 1 year. Odd in a way, but it is life, one must die to complete the cycle. I'll miss them dearly, but I understand it's all apart of life.

There's not much more I can think of right now that deserves attention. I'll have another update like normal one month from now. Good luck with all of you and may your lives be full of good things, if not, well, HA."

"event","Here are my 6 random/odd things about me.

- I feel very depressed and uncomfortable when my car is messy, or worse dirty inside. I guess you can say that it niches over the edge that last bit of neat-freakness.

- I truly do see myself wasting my life playing video games such as World of Warcraft and EVE. I look forward to the day I quit both games yet at th same time I look forward to playing them everynight, what a dilema...

- College is really kicking my ass. For th first time in my life my GPA has fallen under a 3.0 and that isn't sitting to hot with me. I'm starting to get aggrivated that I couldn't transfer my GPA from LCC into MSU, which was a 3.5. Still, nothing 16 hours of extra studying can't fix. So far it's looking like I'll close out this sememester with two 3.0's and a 3.5. That should raise my over all GPA to about 3.1 seeing that I don't have a lot of credits at MSU already. I only hope my summer study will give me a chance to get it back up to 3.5 by the end of this year or else Im going to severly hurt myself, because I cannot afford a low GPA for what I want to do.

- People don't realize but my biggest turn on when it comes to women is actually red hair. Why? I HAVE NO IDEA! I wish I did, but, I don't. It just is.

- The place I work at in the past three months has had an armed robbery, a Mission Impossible style break in, and recently a Cop shooting himself in the back ally. I'm starting to wonder what this month will bring.... Im guessing probably a car will blow up in the parking lot or something...

- I have this tendency to swing a pencil or pen in my hand when in deep thought. I don't know why but I notice if I can swing a pencil/pen in my hand it typically lets me concentrate better and helps me focus. I have this pencil at my computer desk I've had since I was 15 and it's normally the one I use to concentrate. Now that's odd isn't it?"

One movie though touched me more then anyother movie out there, and I thought to myself, wow, this movie is the gayest movie of nerds this side of Carl Schafer. So I give to you, the story of Otaku.... <br /><br />-Movie: Otaku Unite <br />-Purpose: To show us how utterly gay people of anime love can be. <br />-Rating: O for Otaku <br />-Things I did why watching Otaku: Made fun of a man named Thag in it, because he was a giant penis.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000DZ7XXE.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg""><img style=""WIDTH: 169px; HEIGHT: 190px"" height=""1"" alt="""" width=""56"" src=""http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000DZ7XXE.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg"" /></a><br /><br />Yes, I know what you're saying, OH MY FUCKING GOD what the hell was he thinking. Well it's a long story, see Matt and I had plans to see the magical movie of Medeas Family Reunion but by some act of god,&nbsp; forced Matt to run late so we canceled on that idea. So we went to our friendly near by Best Buy where I bought many a fine films from Saving Private Ryan to Contact. Yet browsing the wonderful anime section we stumbled upon a oddity of some sort, a film called ""Otaku Unite"" a documentary about cosplay. We were like ""SNAPS!"" and of course purchased this fine film for $14.99.<br /><br />Now do you know the difference between watching Otaku Unite and Bloodrayne, arguably the worst movie of all time????<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Guys dressed up in womens clothing AND a guy named Jonathan Cook, AKA ""Jonny Otaku""<br /><br />When I first seen this man I realized that if there was one person in the WORLD that was not destined for sex, here he is. The single best example of genetic failure this side of Adam Nevins.<br /><br />Provided is a link of <a href=""http://www.otakuunite.com/otakulture.html"">Jonathan Cook</a>, or from now on&nbsp;better known on this LJ post as &nbsp;""The Unmentionable""<br /><br />Many a years I have prided myself on ripping peoples self esteems apart. Taking on one giant dildo at a&nbsp;time&nbsp;and showing him that he will forever remain a giant dildo but what is the difference between a giant dildo and The Unmentionable? It all comes down to this movie in which he prouding proclaims his love for all things anime.<br /><br />In this movie The Unmentionable shows us why he masterbaits at home everynight to images of his high school love, and this is no lie, Sailor Jupitor. Or Unmentionable also goes on to show us his cosplay stripper show, in which Unmentionable is desireably dressed as Innuasha, GG.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now we must understand that Unmentionable is a self proclaimed radio host hosting a radio program on a Chatanogga Community college station called ""The Sushi Bar"" playing your favorite hits from DBZ, Tenchi Muyo, and Sailor Moon! He hopes to one day become a voice actor and ruin our childrens minds with more nonsense or as Russ would rightfully call it ""Bannanas.""<br /><br />What can you do to save this world from Unmentionable?<br /><br />Please write to his email address which is gladly posted below and tell him this message, kill yourself. If our world is going to possibly live on in peace and Taiyon free, this man, the UNMENTIONABLE must die in a gory death of gaysauce and mellow yellow. THE MAN STRIPPED OUT OF A INNUASHA COSTUME FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!! FUCK! This guy needs a serious ass kicking, if not that one hell of a sex change, because Unmentionable is no doubt the equivalant of a male Carl Schafer.&nbsp;<br /><br />Send Mail Here : <a href=""mailto:askjonnyotaku@otakuunite.com"">askjonnyotaku@otakuunite.com</a><br /><br />Remember, tell him Jake sent you, because I'm not gay.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","<P>You would think that Mondays would be reserved for productive work days such as paper work and bad customer service. You would think that people would stop and ask themselves, why Monday? Now you're asking yourselves what the hell is Jake talking about? IT HAPPENED A FUCKING-GAIN! GG my do people pick Monday, of ALLLLL days to commit robberies? Why!? What's worse it's on my day off, and OH yes, it's more artistic this day around..... let me tell you how Game Hits Robbery Number 2 was commited.</P>
<P>This happened in the early morning hours of Monday, Feburary 6th of 2006. (This is from possible suspects on the list, so I'm just going on possibilities) Two white males in their mid 40's had attempted a breaking and entering on EVERY business in the mall. They pried the back lock off of Super Tans and broke the door but were unable to get in. They had no luck with the coin shop, and anyother business. They then proceeded to go to the front of the mall and smashed in door of a vacant spot (Where Game Hits used to be located) and proceeded to break through floor of the African Braiding Salon.</P>
<P>Once they had no luck there they used their imaginations and found out the back of the African Braiding Salon wasn't even locked so they just nicely.... kicked that in. From there they made a hole on the side of the Tanning salon but couldn't get through, so then they made a attempted to go through the ceiling on our side but couldn't get through that way. Then they attempted at making a hole towards the front of the store but didn't succeed but didn't stop there. They then went into their bathroom and quickly discovered... hey, they dont have anykind of reenforced board here, just drywall, fun time! aned literally broke the wall COMPLETELY down smashing through the bathroom wall like the Incredible Hulk.</P>
<P>Their journey wasn't over yet, OH NO. They had successfully penetrated the store, but now they had to be invisible to our security system. Performing some impressive Mission Impossible stunts they managed to avoid our motion detectors and get behind our counter, rip our locks off, cause a shit load of noise, and then get away with $2000. </P>
<P>This is the most impressive robbery I've ever seen commited that wasn't in a movie. Here are the pictures of the scene, you might find them funny and tasteful.</P>
<P><A href=""http://www.gmhits.com/forum/Forum7/HTML/001364.html"">Click here and go to the sixth entry</A>
<P>All I can say is to whoever you are that did this, kudos, you really wanted that cash. But as an update to the situation, We have possible suspects that were seen at the mall by myself in a old shitty van that were also involved in another robbery in the area and have been suspected of casing the joint for a good 4 weeks now. We do have their license plate number and we have discriptions, so hopefully something turns out on that. Most importantly, they took a $2 bill that was a bait bill that can be used to track them, so hopefully we can get that on them to if the time comes.</P>
<P>Alright, nothing about me personally, except eating re-heated Shrimp makes for a painful bathroom break.... and yes Carl, I know my voice mail sucks now, Ill have to find something new for it, something creative.</P>"

<P><STRONG>The motherboard in this is bad the green light comes on but the blue will not. It would never read any disks the ribbon cable was not even connected to the laser. I want my money back and you can have the ps2 back. The other one is fine. But it took work to get it to read the disks. The pot setting were cranked all the way up. You're running a fucking scam show down there, these things are shitty, not even broken properly. Thanks Brian</STRONG></P>

<P><BR><STRONG>Type of Claim:</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The claim states the item received was significantly not as<BR>described. The buyer presented the following reason(s) for the claim:</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The buyer did not specify why the item was significantly not as described.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The buyer has provided additional information about why this claim is being<BR>filed:</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Seller says in auctions ps2 has disk read error. The 1 ps2 is okay. The<BR>other one the motherboard is bad and the blue light won't come on to open<BR>the cd/dvd/drive tray. Then the ribbon cable was not even connected to the<BR>laser. So there is no way the ps2 even worked as described in what he put<BR>on the description in his auction. The item was misrepresented and I would<BR>of never purchased the ps2. And he can pay me to send it back.</STRONG></P>
<P>Jake wrote...</P>
<P><STRONG>LOL dude, it's broken, are you fucking serious?</STRONG></P>
<P>Brian wrote...</P>
<P><STRONG>PayPal will take care of it. They are use to people who misrepresent their items just to sell it. They will make the decision. You sure talk alot of shit. You should be mad at yourself. I did not screw you You screwed me. I just want you to know I will get my money back, you will not get away with this. So leave it at that.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>PS You're going to rot in hell for this bullshit.</STRONG></P>
<P>Jake wrote to paypal...</P>
<P><STRONG>Hello,</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I reviewed the information and also all the buyers e-mails that he has sent</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>to me and I'm going to have to deny the request based on the following <BR>information, which I will provide proof as well. The auction was for a <BR>already broken Sony Playstation 2 unit that had a known defect called a<BR>""Disk Read Error"" which means it won't read games. I auction these things<BR>off to a number of different buyers, most of which come back to buy again<BR>and again in their attempts to fix them. Seeing that they attempt to fix<BR>them themselves I make each sale final because they open them up and then<BR>tamper with the insides of these machines. The buyer provided me with a<BR>e-mail informing me that he had already opened the system up and attempted<BR>to fix it. Which is displayed below for your viewing. The buyer had also<BR>told me that the ribbon wire was removed from the inside which could very<BR>well likely be because that wire is attached to the top of the case and<BR>only<BR>gives off about an inch of extra slack and normally will remove itself from</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>the casing if that taken off improperly. Outside of that the buyer has <BR>already taken the system apart and has also cited me for a refund on both<BR>systems which he has already stated that the other was fine (I'm guessing<BR>he<BR>was able to fix it.) I'll leave this up to you, normally I don't have<BR>problems with people who want their money back on non-recievement or they<BR>just didn't like the item and don't care if they have to pay me back on<BR>shipping. However, I can't accept a return on a already broken system and a</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>system that has been opened by the buyer which leads me to suspect probably</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>caused the problems he described to me. If you have anymore questions<BR>please<BR>feel free to e-mail me back but I feel paypal can handle this claim<BR>appropriatly.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Sincerly Jacob Walls</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Buyers E-mail.... Caution, this was in ebay mail, so I did the best cut and</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>paste job I did, forgive me....</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>The motherboard in this is bad the green light comes on but the blue will<BR>not. It would never read any disks the ribbon cable was not even connected<BR>to the laser. So why are you putting on your auction it has a Disk Read<BR>Error. I want my money back and you can have the ps2 back. The other one is</STRONG></P>

<TD>Seymour - the weird haircut was my first clue. He had all the earmarks of one crazy bastard, and it turned out I was right. An intelligent man, Seymour hides his evil tendencies behind a false devotion to Yevon. The master of his facade (or maester, if you will), not even those closest to him ever knew he had such an evil streak - that is until it fell apart. Never being a spiritual man, Seymour lacked patience. When that wore thin his true nature spilled out bringing his entire house of cards down - and nearly taking Yevon with him. As for you, I'd avoid developing the green eyes of jealousy, and I'd get a haircut, hippie! Anyway, if you're anything like Seymour, you've probably got the whole neighborhood fooled. I'd be careful, though. Seymour fell apart faster than it takes a balloon to pop, so I'd make sure you keep that house of cards guarded very well. Other similar characters include Khaos(ff1), Rufus(ff7) and Norg(ff8) Your Polar opposite is Dagger. You'll probably get along with Sephiroth, and you could tolerate Vincent or Bahamut. </TD></TR>

You guys like posting emo stuff, so be it.

BAURGH! Then I shall follow suit and make my OWN emo post and make it better then ALL OF YOURS!

For starters I finally shaved off absolutly nothing, its been a defining change in my life, this lack of shaved off nothing hasn't helped that I'm in love with a giant carrot named Ted.

Yet in all seriousness I have almost nothing bad to post about. I have money, work is good, Sam and I are doing well, and World of Warcraft has come back into my life. What more do I have to ask for?

I cleaned my car today, it was dirty, like Carls mom, but I cleaned it, like Russ did his pipes like that one night Jim ""Mysteriously"" seen through a window, which I do confess! That takes talent Jimmie boy, looking at the size of that window and the angle of the bed I'd say you had to get on your knees to see into the portal of DARKNESS!!!!!!!!!!!

So Sam finally let me go all over her face finally. I thought I share that with the world. I know her friends and family will be reading this which I find amusing. So ya, victory for Jake and the forces of sexor! Pearl Necklaces are for winners!

I avenged Jim and beat up some homeless people. I figured if Jim couldn't do it, then I would. So I put on my Captain America outfit and kicked some major homeless ass. I just want you to know Jim, that those men were armed with beer bottles, one even called himself the ""Assualter of Beer Bottle Man"" which I thought was Portegese for ""I like cheese omlets.""

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TURK! I miss you man. I know I missed your party December 26th, I was held up at gun point, so promise it wasn't intentional. Tell me when your next party is or the next big hang out over there, Jake will be crashing it, and yes, when I do, I will be wearing pants.

Heath, I absolutly feel you out on the whole holiday thing. I always hate January, it is the single most depressing month of the year. My credit card bills come in, work slows down a little, no holidays are coming up, and of course distant relatives keep urging me to come up and visit, which I probably never will but I always say ""ya when I get some time I will!"" It will never happen... never.

You know what's emo, I'm watching To Wan Foo right now, and I must say you know Wesly Snipes had Blade Trinity coming after this......

Melissa Melissa Melissa, emo time for YOU! It's ok, I know what it's like to teach children, I once held a seminar at the Kellogg Center about the potental profits of bacon grease, and you know what, I slapped me up some hommies. Yet I must say, you do have a hard job, I always thought my job was hard, but no, I do admire your job and what you do with your life. If I could I would probably get a job with more meaning in life then work at a video game story making phat cash and playing World of Warcraft. Yet thinking about it, nah....

RUSS! I have absolutly no idea what the hell you say half the time. I think it's probably a inside joke then I was watching the news today and I noticed Osama Bin Laden released another message then it hit me like a ton of bricks, you are his inside contact. You secretly poss as Jack Black and get past security blocks the government as set up. FALSENESS! TERRORIST!

Hey Jim............. bums lol

Ummmm.... who else reads this....

LEE! Stop making posts that dont interest me, talk about me! THEY ARE BETTER WHEN THEY MENTION ME!

Hey... ummm David, ya you. Seriously buddy, I beg of you, know I COMMAND YOU to stop making me think of the emo song whenever I read your posts. Post something funny like ""LOL today I came home and cut myself because cutting myself allows me to releave gayness! LOL!"" See, now that's a post, DO IT!

Rei........... bums lol

MATT! I want to let you know, I watched Roll Bounce and it was everything I remembered it to be.

NATE! I love .................... bums lol

Sam, I know you always complain about me not posting enough about you, so I'll give it a shot. I first want to say that I love you, and I dispise the hair you leave in the shower when you get out. It builds up on the drain part and makes the water fill the tub. So when I get fed up with it I finally move it with my foot and it sticks to my foot like a predator. Please, in the future feed your hair so it doesn't eat my foot.

I think I covered all the basses here, if I missed one of you, TO BAD! Oh and Deana, ya I remembered you, I have a personal question... do you think the Arby's 5 for 5 deal is worth it? I'm kind of hungry right now. PEACE!

SHIT! Carl... ya, forgot about you. I'm going to change my voice mail but I'm debating between family guy or the Tunak song, what do you think?

SHIT AGAIN! Jesse! I just wanted to say that it is possible to get home eat and back on campus in 1 hour, you just have to be Jesus-Gonzales, you know the Mexican fence jumper with heavenly powers to defy and MSU boarder patrol man....

OK, I forgot two more people but screw it, I love bed more then typing..."

"event","So yes... I can finally say I've experienced the harsher end of armed robbery. To most of you who read this you've already heard the story, you've already seen it on the news, and I'm sure you've seen the battle scars Shawn wears around proudly right now. Alas though to those of you who havn't, I think I'll fill you in on probably one of the most exciting and stunning moments in my known existence....

-----

Here I was with Shawn at Game Hits the day after Christmas and it had been one hell of a busy day, as it normally is. It was business as usual, nothing special and I decided I wanted to duck out early to get somethings done, especially my laundry. Earlier Dayne, as he normally does called me up and wanted me to return the call, so hell I did and I stuck around for a little while longer. I sat down on a chair and just begin talking oblivious to my surroundings. Suddenly I look up and there are two masked black males, about 6ft tall each (nether could have been over 18, both kids) pointing a gun at both myself and Shawn and demanded all the money in the store. I look at Shawn and Shawn looks at me and we say at the same time ""are you serious?"" Both of us thought it was a friend of the store, same build, same height, hell it wasn't outside of him to try and fool us. To that question he shoots the gun at the ground and repeats the demand again. So, he's for real.

During this time Dayne is hearing everything in the background and hangs up the phone and dials 911 at the same time the gunman orders me off of the phone. Shawn then begins to walk towards the cash register and opens it up. In his own words he looks down and says in his head damn that's way to much money. Then it clicks in Shawns head, it was a CAP GUN! They were using a fake weapon and scaring us, so Shawn yells out ""It's a Fucking cap gun call the police!"" The two masked men begin to scramble for the door, but OH no, Shawn decides to Hulk up in this moment. During this same time the two try to escape but instead of pulling on our door they push on it shattering the glass and causing a pile up of criminal in the corner. Shawn and myself jump the counter towards them, Shawn actually TACKLES the two of them at the same time and begins yelling dial 911. I grab the phone and dial those lovelly three numbers and get ahold of a operater and the police are already on their way. At the same time the two criminals and Shawn fight it out and Shawn manages to get BOTH of them into head locks! (Never fuck with Shawn, seriously.) The gunman pistol wipes Shawn 5 times in the back of the head and then twice in the face to free themselves. Shawn lets go and both scramble for the door and take off running.

I rush out after them to see the direction but dont catch it (luckly three witnesses do and with descriptions of the clothing.) Police cars suddenly descend on the area in no less then a minute after they ran out, literally covering the parking lot and the surrounding streets. Meanwhile inside Shawn is bleeding pretty heavily from the head and blood is pouring onto his shirt. The police arrive on the scene with an ambulance and begin a walking search for the criminals seeing that they fled on foot. Eventually K9 units were brought to the scene to track their scent. 

It turns out the two had a parked car behind the store waiting for their escape. No one seen them get into the car or even seen the car so they unfortunatly escaped arrest and are still at large. Shawn suffered lasherations to the back of the head and to the face, nothing permant, but took a lot of stiches to fix up. We had out window replaced today and can thankfully say they got exactly $0 and ZERO games. They actually dropped a backpack at the scene so hopefully they can get some evidence off of that, but don't hold your breath on it. 

We made every news station that night and had a crap load of concerned phone calls this morning when we opened. Turned out the city heard about it so thank you all for your support and concerns. I have to send a big thanks to Jim and Matt who helped me clean up the mess and a huge thanks to Ed who helped board up the window for the night. It's an unfortunate event, and I never thought I'd experience it in reality, but it's true, it all goes so fast that you can think of a million other decisions I wish I would have done that I didn't, like take ths scissors and stab the guy closest to me.

This was a tramatic experience for both Shawn and I, and we can agree, we don't like being left alone in the store now. Odds are we will work double shifts for the next couple weeks together until it wears off. The police told Shawn and I that they could come back and try to show us up the next time and maybe bring a real gun. Scary to think about, but we are not going to change locations or business hours. Security cameras will be installed very shortly, that is a plus to this event. It just sucks though that for once in my life I'm somewhat scared to go to work, not knowing what kind of shit will happen again. Yet in the long run I can say this, I was held at gun point, how many of you can say that? Didn't think so...."

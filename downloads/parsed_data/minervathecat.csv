Well, I'm still a house cat.&nbsp; I live in the basement where Dad's stuff is so the other cats don't bother me.&nbsp; I still have to use the litter box, which I am not thrilled about, but I get a lot of attention from Dad. I help him play World of Warcraft, you know.&nbsp; Yes, I&nbsp;am his good luck charm.&nbsp; Plus petting me gives him something to do.&nbsp; What did he ever do before I moved back inside? Ha ha ha.

So yeah, the leg is still a bum leg, but I get around.&nbsp; Anyone who goes into the basement obviously must pet me.

I&nbsp;hear Mama and Dad talk about moving Maurice inside to live down here with me, provided he won't harass the bunny. Who would want to bother a boring old bunny anyway?&nbsp; Apparently he misses me (who can blame him?).&nbsp; I know he'd like to be inside with Mama and other women anyway.&nbsp; Maurice has a strange thing for female humans, especially if he can play with their hair.&nbsp; 

I know, cat females are way more awesome, but there's no accounting for taste.&nbsp;"

"event","I know, I know, long time no bloggy, but for the longest time nothing of note has happened with me.&nbsp; I eat,&nbsp;I poop, I roll in the dirt, I nap.&nbsp; 

Well, last week, something terrible happened.&nbsp; I was out in the main part of the yard, enjoying some fresh grass, when suddenly that big bad dog, Sasha attacked me!&nbsp; She seemed to think I was a rabbit or something from the way she grabbed and shook me.&nbsp; Dad stopped her, but then rushed me to this big horrible smelling place where they took pictures of me.&nbsp; Well, for now my left leg doesn't work.&nbsp; The mean human says I may need surgery.

Mama said she was worried that surgery would be too hard on a cat as old as me. Old!? I'm only 15, the nerve!&nbsp; Mama is twice my age!

But, the mean guy says he doesn't want me trying to jump so now I live inside again.&nbsp; I have to use a litter box which sucks, but what can you do?&nbsp; It's hard for me to get around without my leg working right, but my people sisters took very good care of me while Mama was gone.&nbsp; I'm not in pain, but definitely not used to my limited mobility.

I'm getting lots of cuddles though.&nbsp; We're still in the &quot;wait and see&quot; process. Mama's going to consult more mean people and I suppose this means Mama and Dad will drag me off to one of those stinky places.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; Being me is a lot of work.

Mama is very angry with Sasha (and I am too!).&nbsp; How dare she!&nbsp; She's never attacked any of us cats before.&nbsp; 

Hopefully we can get me back to 100% so I can go back to living in my room like I&nbsp;like.&nbsp;"

"event","Well, it's understandable.&nbsp; Things stay pretty much constant for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall be 15 in September and I still look darn good (yeah, try not to hate).&nbsp; Still live in my kitty abode with Maurice (formerly known as Electra).&nbsp; Eating, sleeping, pooping, all that.&nbsp; The people need to take me on more car rides, but they've been crazy busy as of late - they are both gone all day and take all the little people with them.&nbsp; 

Maurice had a brief stint as an indoor cat again, but of course he blew it by spraying.&nbsp; When will he learn that the humans don't like that in the house. &nbsp;Mama liked him living indoors, but I like having a warm body to cuddle with, ya know?

Mama is concerned because I am getting close to the age that my older sister, Cassy was when she got renal failure which eventually cost her her life.&nbsp; I&nbsp;feel young and spry though.

Glad the weather is slowly warming. As much as I love my heat lamp, it's just not the same as being able to sun myself."

Yup, Mama came and got him when she got home today and moved him back into the big house with the other cats and the dogs.  Why he would want to be in there with all that ruckus is beyond me.  He actually likes other cats and having humans (espescially the female ones) pet him and hold him.  I like being petted and all, but other animals just drive me crazy.  

Needless to say, I'm one content cat right now."

"event","Ground Rules: The first player of this ""game"" starts with the topic ""5 weird habits of yourself"" and people who get tagged need to write a lj entry about their 5 quirky habits as well as state this rule clearly. In the end, you need to choose the next 5 people to be tagged and list their names.

1.  I absolutely do not use cat litter.  I would rather soil my sleeping area and sit in it than touch that stuff.

2.  I need my own space! I do not like other cats or dogs.  In fact, I have my own room complete with a bed, heat lamp, and enclosed courtyard in the back of Mama's garage.  Electra lives out there with me, but Mama plans to move him back into the house eventually.

3.  I LOVE to go on car rides!  

4.  I picked out my Mama rather than vice versa.  She had no idea we needed each other until I decided this was so. :-)  She wandered around looking at all the kitties and I meowed at her and rubbed myself against the bars so she would pet me and then made a point of ignoring all other humans who came near me.  I just knew we were right for each other.

5.  I have no claws on any of my feet.  When Mama got me, I already didn't have them, so I have to have others scratch me to be scratched really well.  

All my friends who haven't done this meme yet should do it.  There are only 10 of you total and I think 5 of you have either done it or been tagged.  So if you haven't yet, TAG!"

I don't mind it too terribly as I do have my own room with it's heat lamp and soft fluffy bed.  Plus I've got this nice thick fur coat grown in.  I do really need my own space.  I'm glad Mama finally figured this out - if you want to have a cat that is as awesome as me, you need to provide her with her own bedroom, and own private courtyard.  What can I say?  I deserve it. :-)

I'd take some rugs, but I'd probably get lazy and poop on them and then they'd be ruined.  I did this with the rug I used to have.  And Electra's bed.  

I should get Mama to bring me out some warm food.  Warm fish or turkey would be really good in my tummy right now."

"event","Here's a rundown of some of the key players in the life of yours truly:

Mama - This is my favorite human that I own.  She pets and loves me and takes me for car rides.  She is the one I chose from the Animal Rescue League.  She also does my typing since it would take me a long time to do it myself (as I don't have very long toes or an opposable thumb). 

Dad - My next favorite human.  He pretends I annoy him, but I know he loves me.  He feeds me and for some reason keeps taking all the poop I make when I do it in my room.  Humans are so strange sometimes.  

The big small human - Dad already had this human when Mama got me.  She's pretty wild, but since she goes to a place called school for the bulk of the day, it means more car rides for me when Mama has to go get her.

The little humans - There are two.  Mama had them at the same time.  I didn't know humans could have litters like we do.  Go figure.  These little humans LOVE me (but then again, who doesn't?).  I like 'em too.  Mama is helping them to learn how to pet me nicely.

Electra - my male roomate.  We don't always get along and I know he'd rather live in the house, but Mama says he pees everywhere so he has to live out with me (thanks Mama!). We are getting along pretty well for the most part and it's nice to have another warm body to share my bed with when it's cold.  

Dante - Inside cat.  He and I always got along fine.  He's siamese and is a half-brother to Electra.

Yoshi - Calico inside cat.  She's shy and is afraid of everything so she was good about staying out of my way.

Persephone - Little tabby inside cat.  She's cute, but always did whatever Electra wanted and that included pestering me.  

Lysander - Pudgy orange inside cat.  Kinda wound up.  He and I don't know each other so well

The Mutts - These are Dad's dogs. Mama calls them both mutt.  They're typical dogs - they jump and bark and slobber.  It would be nice if they never came out at all to bug me when I'm out on my patio or on my leash.  It's so annoying to have to wash slimy dog drool off one's sleek coat.

Well, that's the family I live with.  Better get back in my kennel now, it's raining."

"event","I didn't live with Mama until I was 3 1/2.  Prior to then, I lived with some humans I'd like to forget who gave me a really dopey name (Cosmo).  So I found myself brought to what they called an ""Animal Rescue League"" that actually turned out to be a bunch of cages with many noisy smelly roomates.  Humans of varying sizes came an poked at yours truly.  It was such an undignified place to be.  Then I saw the human I knew I wanted to be mine.  She quietly approached the cage I was living in.  I meowed my sweetest meow and rubbed myself against the bars so she could appreciate the softness of my fur.  She petted me and cooed. She moved on to look at some of my fellow captives, but kept coming back.  Could she possibly want me to live with her?  I paid no attention to any other humans and I saw her take note of this. 

She arranged to meet me in one of the rooms at the Rescue League.  It was love at first sight.  She filled out the paper work and we were together then and have been henceforth.  On my first car ride with my new Mama and Dad, Mama held me in her arms and gave me my new beautiful name.  Minerva."

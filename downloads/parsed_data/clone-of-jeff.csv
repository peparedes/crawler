They hate being called the first ""c-word"" and they all like doing the second one.

No dude likes to color.

Whats in that extra x chromosome that makes this something you like to do?


Like I heard a comedian say one day.... ""women are from Venus... men are from earth."""

After much hilarity and running around the parking lot I was able to snag the bag off its head.

Here is ""Cheeto"" in all his glory.

"event","wow...

i was reading my entries from my old livejournal account   <lj user=""mr_labeck"">  I stopped using it because of a lost password and old email addy so i couldnt keep posting on it.

I cant believe i actually wrote some of the flighty things i did on there.  I must have been half asleep most of the time.

I am much more reserved these days with public postings.


I once got angry at <lj user=""the_anti_hero""> for posting a youtube video with clone of jeff in the title.  I dont like the idea of people that might know me from other social circles reading my LJ.  

I dont need people from work reading it.  Or my parents... guh."

"event","What was wrong with Scarlet Johansson's nose that she had to have plastic surgery a couple years ago?

Shes a looker.. no doubt.

Reminds me of when Big Mike told  me and DBO that he didnt find Cameron Diaz attractive.   Maybe shes not your ""type"" but she is an attractive girl.

The inner male of me enjoys the fact that women have this self doubt that enables us white males to have control over em.  The fact is though.. they are the B.O.M.B. but most of em dont believe it 100 percent.  I was having a discussion with Courtney tonight and it still surprises me how women today dont see the good in them that others see.

anyhoo...."

"event","It seems to me that the future of music is singles.  Only ever hearing one or two songs off each ablum.....

NEWSFLASH!!!!

everyone knows this.  nothing new here.


But something strange has happened to me lately.  I have been err... umm... downloading.. perhaps legally.... perhaps not... torrent files instead of crap of bearshare and such.  As a result it is much more difficult to find single songs... but much easier to get whole albums.. even whole catalogs of an artist in one download.
So now I find myself listening to entire albums again in their entirety... from beginning to end... something I dont do unless its a Tori or Radiohead or other such album the last few years.
So many cool songs I would have otherwise missed.... plus it reminds me of a simpler time.... when I was a kid... I listened to tapes as a whole.. couldnt just go track to track like you could with a CD.
Dave Nobles.... fraternity brother of mine.... he used to load up a few cds at parties and just let em run... I still remember 2/5th of the music every night being Eagles tunes... and not just all the radio stuff.

So... nothing else here... go home.... listen to some albums in their entirety... the way they were meant to be.. maybe find some gold in those CDs...

Ive been a fan of the Dead for years.... but until a couple months ago... I never heard American Beauty from front to back.... now thats some good shit....

Ciao."

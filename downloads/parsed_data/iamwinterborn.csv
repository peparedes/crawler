I dont blame anyone for not..So you might have already heard, but I bought myself a car!!! it's a 2002 white dodge neon.  It has 40k miles, and i bought it for 5,000 dollars.  It was a great deal and i love it.

Speaking of Brandon.. he sent me my xmas gift a week or so ago hehe.. yes i know it's late.. but that was my fault.  he wasnt going to send it til i sent him something first.. and since i suck at sending things.. it took me years lol...   he got me the nip and tuck season 1 box set, a card with some really sweet words in them, a stalking with chocolate, an ornament, and the best mix cd ever! 

grrr alright i dont really feel like updating anymore.. so thats all.. haha"

"event","I'm so sorry guys.. I have  been slacking really bad with this journal.  Life has been great.. Meeting lots of people due to my new job, also the girl that was hired when I was hired has not showed up in a few days so i'm gonna start picking up hours which is a plus for me because I LOVE working.  My Boss is great, the co-workers are fun,  the shoes are all sexy and yeah.. it's just really good.

The weather have been horrible here.  It took me a full hour to drive home from work today.  There was about 6 inches of snow on the roads and they weren't plowed yet.. so I had to basically drive without having a set road.  Good thing I know the roads well enough.  we're suppose to get another 6 inches by tomorrow.. gah I hate snow!

Well i'm really tired and so I am going to cut this short.. but I promise to update more!"

"event","gah, so i went out with the girls tonight.. I knew i was in for a crazy time because they are such crazy people. 

we met up at a sports bar which was pirates night.. Did you know that it was national pirates day yesterday?? ARRRRRRRRRRGH i'm a pirate.

we then went to tilly's.. another bar.. and i swear the craziest guys hit on me. This guy with a red shirt came up to me and commented on my white stiletto boots (unpractical but very sexy) The guy didnt give a very good impression and i wanted him to leave me alone.. so i went and sat by my friends.. he comes over with fucking mittens on.. like what the fuck??? why?? LOL 

he then takes off his mittens and wanted me to shake his hand but you could see they were all sweaty and shit so i was like fuck no.. and told him to leave me alone lol.. 

we quickly left and went to a dance club.. we danced and got drunk for free.. ahhh it's nice to tell boys to buy you things and they do lol. We kept going up to guys asking them to show us their undies and they would.. everytime we guessed it right we would take a shot..

Then the girls kept bugging me to get up on the bar and dance.. i was like ugh no thank you.. they kept pushing me until i finally did.. i made 25 dollars in like 3 mins which isnt all that bad.. 

the night went really quick.. before i knew it the night was over and we left.. one of my friends drove me to my car and she left.. i went to start my car and ugh!!! it didnt start!!! I tried to call all my friends in town but no one was answering their phone.. who would? it was quarter to 3! lol 

I ended up having to go to the bar that my car was at and walked in and asked if he could call me a cab or something so i could go to my friends house since i knew where the key was.. he called and it would of took an hour for the taxi to get there.. what the hell! LOL .. so yeah.. he offered to drive me to my friends house.. and i accepted..

that was pretty much my night.. nothing too exciting i suppose

"event","Ahhh what a boring week so far! lol.  I have been doing nothing all week since I only worked 4 hours on monday and then I have been doing nothing for the past two days.  It gets really really boring.  I wish I could go to work right now so I have something to do.  oh well I do get to work tomorrow which is good.

So yeah, I had a really shitty new years which I think I brought up the other day.   But if I didnt, just know I came home at 10pm and fell asleep before midnight.  I was really upset with my friends.  One of them called me yesterday and asked me how I was and stuff and I told her.  She asked me if I was still mad at Tabitha. I had to laugh and say ""I was actually mad at both of you, not just Tab""  She didnt know I was mad at her.  Well now she knows. 

Ohh, guess who might be getting Playoff Tickets to go to see the Pack!  Dana might.  Woot.  I have tickets lined up if I want them..  But I dont know if I want to go because everytime I go to a game they lose.. Blah!  I went to the playoff game a few years ago when we hosted the falcons and well we know the outcome.  The packers lost :(  So yeah, i'm a bit scared to go.  We'll see what happens.. I'll make sure to let ya know!"

"event","Well havent I been a slacker lately?  When was the last time I updated?  It has to been almost a week.. Gah!  SORRY!!  Lots have been going on.. Work is doing great, It does suck now that I have money and walk aimlessly around the stores wanting to buy stuff and I can't seem to find a damn thing that is interesting.  When I didnt have money I could always find something i enjoyed.  Oh well.. I just decided to go clothes shopping and that was fun.  I found tons of great deals.  Let's see..  I got tons of sweaters, my NFC NORTH CHAMP shirt.. GO PACK!!  I also bought my really sexy white leather boots!!  They are so sexy but one problem they have NOO gripping.. Sooo of course living in Wisconsin it had to have frozen rain all day today and I wore my boots to my grandma.. I could not walk at all on them.. I guess it doesnt help that the heal is so narrow and big haha.. but yeah.. I had to have my dad carry me to the car and then to the house.. I bet he enjoyed that LOL.. other than that.. I also bought a poncho, some jeans, and a blazer jacket.

How was everyone's new years??  Mine was shitty as fuck.  I got really pissed off at my friends.  They were being bitches and now I have no need to talk to them.  I will not talk to them either until they call me.  Screw them for being rude.  I ended up coming home from the bar early and watched packer DVDs and played video games.  I have been trying to beat Zelda: Wind Waker for the past few days.. and I suck balls..  I enjoy link to the past much better.  I cant even get past the firsst dungeon thing LOL..  I have even tried to get the runthroughs on GAME FAQs  but to no avail, it doesnt help.  

I cant believe tomorrow is the last regular season football game of the season.. It makes me really REALLY depressed.  I have to go too long without football pretty soon.. at least the packers are in the playoffs and I get to watch my team for a few more weeks!!  Speaking of playoffs.. If I am correct.. The saints will play the packers if they win tomorrows game.  My friend Joe's favorite team is the saints.  He said he has tickets for us if the saints win tomorrow.. He even said he'd take off his shirt at the game! lol.  So yeah, I hope the saints win so we can play them and I can go to the game.. 

I played trivia pursuit yet again today.  Of course I won.. I fucking rock at that game.  The questions in the trivia pursuit 90s edition are really easy..  I need something with more of a challenge.. I hope we play tomorrow and play the 6th edition.. That one is a bit harder which is always good.  I dont understand how I can do so good in that game.  Apparently I have a head full of random knowledge.  Don't under estimate me!!  I might surprise ya.. I know i surprised my family with the things i know.. yay!"

"event","Merry Christmas Everyone.. How is everyone doing today??  I hope everyone got what they asked for and had a great day with their family.  I enjoyed my day very much.  I ended up going over to my Grandma's house really early.. we ate this really good yummy egg caserole and hanky panky(a orginal thing we do as a tradition.. it's a great food!!)  so yeah, after that we went to the bigger family room and started exchanging gifts.. I got a few gift cards and some money.. and bath and body works shit and other smelling stuff.. apparently people thought I stunk LOL

After we did the gift exchange, My 2 aunts and my Grandma started our traditional trivia pursuit marathon.. today's game lasted us about 8 hours..  we took breaks, cooked dinner inbetween, ate dinner, mingled and what not so it wasnt an actual continued game from start to end...  At one point I was losing.. I had none of my pie pieces and everyone else had at least 5 (there is 6 pie pieces to get)  So yeah, I started answering all my questions right and ended up passing them up and winning the game..  I win more than anyone else because I fucking rock :)  quick, worship me.. lol

Did anyone watch the football game christmas eve??  Packers vs Vikings?? GOO PACK GOO!!  They won the game.. 2nd defeat over the vikings this year.. and ironically it was the same score both times and ended with the same sort of thing.. Ryan Longwell kicking the winning field goal.. GO RYAN!  So let me just say I was the happiest girl you could ever imagine yesterday..  The Pack just clinched their division with that game! 3 years in a row I think that makes it!

So yeah, I bet you are DYING to know what I recieved for christmas..  Well here I go.. I already told you about the money, and all that stuff..  but I never did tell you what I got yesterday from my mom's side and also my parents.  After 3 years of not getting me anything I got a videogame console thing from my parents.  It has all the old skool games like dignug, pacman, qbert, donkeykong, burgertime, galaxy, duck hunt, tetris, etc..  It's pretty damn cool, I must admit.  Good job parents.  You finally did something right!

My aunt bought me a deep fryer..  because my mom broke my other one.  Yesterday my mom said she bought it for me.. but I found out today she didnt.. oh well.. I now get fatty food that is quick and easy to make.. SCORE!!"

"event","Well, you remember how my car didnt have heat.. and my dad told me to buy that stupid thermastat and such.. Well I went and did that, and then he went to go put it in.. well he never did.. He said the car didnt need it because the car just needed anti freeze..  Ohh.. great.. thanks!  ya know??  I was happy it was fixed but he was a dickhead that didnt go check the car before I went and bought the piece.

Sooo that isnt the whole story.. I start driving to work yesterday.  It was around negative 5 degrees.. I realize right away I still don't have heat..  It was too late to turn around and tell him about it.. so I drove with no heat to work.. I ended up staying over at my friends because I wasnt going to drive home in the weather we had last night.  It was negative 32 or something.. Without windchill mind you..  I hate cold weather..

I bet you are dying to know what I did last night huh??  Well Tab called me and told me she was having a small get together at her house for drinks and such.  I head over there after work, Met a few friends of her from her work, talked about random shit.. It was nice.. Jenn, Brenda and Bill showed up at Tabs and we decided to drive over to Weston Lanes and see how the band was over there.  Joe called and said he'd meet us over there but he never showed up.. stupid fuck LOL.. I saw Gary at the Lanes.. He was leaving when we got their because he has to open up one of his cellcom stores tomorrow for an employee of his.  That sucks he has to do it on Christmas Eve.. Oh well I suppose..

But yeah, after Weston Lanes we headed over to the Luah and wanted to see if the club was open or just the bar, it was just the bar so we headed over to Perkins..  That is all we did.. pretty boring night really.. good company nonetheless.  I ended up staying at Jenn and Bills house last night.. we watched a show about porn stars LOL..  it was eventful..

Oh, i'm ""curious"" today..  LOL  I'm wearing britney spears perfume curious.. Jenn decided on ""shy""  how studly.. lol"

"event","I finished my christmas shopping today.  One thing I hate is buying for other people..  It's horrible.. Who said giving is better than receiving.. call me a greedy bitch but I much rather receive than give.. Oh and i'm talking about presents.  Not sexual occurances because I don't mind giving in that situation lol

I bet you all want to know what I bought today.  I bought molly a scrap book kit, it has soo much shit it's insane.  I then bought Nikki two DVDs.. Mr Deeds and 50 First dates.. she likes adam sandler.  I then purchased Tony Hawk Underground for Brett.. He shoud enjoy that..  I then bought Hannah some little toys.. I already gave them to her since I know after christmas she is going to have SOOO many toys she wont know what to do with any of them.

Gah, the weather is soo horrible.  It's insanely cold.  The high today was 3 degrees.. tomorrow the high is negative 5.  I hate wisconsin.  Michigan is suppose to get 8 inches tonight.  Better them than me.. I fucking hate snow but I already said that before though..

I went to my grandma's today, sang some karoake, and I then was cleaning the backroom and I found old home movies from the 80s lol.   I watched my birthday party when I turned 5.  Awww how cute was I.  I got playdoh.. SCORE!!!  I want more playdoh hah.  My cousins Tyler and Ryan  from Chicago are up for the Holidays.  They are going to come visit me tomorrow at work before they go christmas shopping.  I will probably go out to lunch with them or something.  It shall be fun."

"event","My Father is a fucking prick.  Let me give you a bit of info on him before I start ranting about him.  Firstly, he is that type of guy that if he is upset or miserable he wants everyone else he encounters to feel the same way.  Secondly, he is a alcoholic drunk who has no consideration for anyone but him and his next miller high life.  So the other day my mom and I were talking about how the heater is going out of the car, She said it stopped working properly AFTER my dad used the car to drive to Ohio.  Well tonight on my way home from work, the heater decided not to work at all (mind you it was negative 3 out)  So I get home, take a shower, hear him come home.. I run downstairs to explain what the problem was.. and he goes ""go to a garage and get it fixed""  Well why is it my place to fix it??

Let me give you a little outline why it isnt my play to fix it!
1. it's not my car.
2. I've only started driving it 2 weeks ago
3. He broke the heater
4. He has no job, he can fix a fucking heater in a car.

So yeah, He basically said ""you have a job now, pay for it yourself""  well fuck you father.  I will just purchase my own car so i dont have to put up with your fucking bullshit.  He thinks he is this great guy.. little does he know i hate him and everything about him.  He always says things like ""you dont love me dana""  well i want to say ""fuck yeah i dont.  i hate your fucking guts, go die"" LOL  but i dont.

Enough of that, Work was nice.  I hate the girl i work with on tuesdays and thursdays.. Her name is Rachelle.. and she is just dumber than a box of rocks..  She hates working there too so she always makes the time miserable.  Stop complaining and do your job bitch is what i want to tell her lol.. I mean seriously.  It's an easy job.  You help people buy shoes, you check them out.  You process shoes and put them out to sell.  That is the basic things there is to do.  Not much else required for the job.  Half the time at night it gets real slow so you just get to sit there and do nothing.  The store is, however, open til 10 this week due to christmas.  Who in their right mind would go shopping at 10pm?? I just dont understand lol  oh well.  i dont have to stay that late.. i'm happy!

leave me comments.. it'll make me feel happy and special ;)"

"event","Gah.. The weather is HORRIBLE here.  It has snowed all fucking day, at least 6 inches of snow.  I just finished watching a weather update as well and by tomorrow morning we should have another 6 inches.  For all the people who were wishing for a white christmas..  Stay far away from me.  I might just have to hurt you.  I despise snow.  I should boycott it for now on.  Who needs snow anyways??  Seriously, what does it do that helps the environment??  NOTHING.  So there for we should have no snow ever. 

Alright, I dont pray, and if you don't pray.. do it tonight.  Fergy of the Green Bay Packers is in the hospital with a sprained neck.  He does have feeling in his legs now but he didnt on the way to the hospital.  From what i've heard, his arms are weak, and is still in the hospital for at least one more night.  I am really feeling for him and his family.  I wish him a full recovery!

I am sooo fucking glad I have myself a job now.  I spent the entire day downstairs watching cable.  It was more than boring.  It was just torture.  I wanted to go to work just to make my day more eventful.  I like going to work and talking to the customers and selling shoes is soo great.  I love it lol..  I work tomorrow which is grand.  I just hope the roads are good.  I dont wanna drive 40 mins in shitty weather..  Wish me luck on that.

"event","Work wasnt all that bad today.  I was allowed to watch the game as I worked out on the floor which was definately good.  Gah, but the packers lost.  They did, however, clinch a playoff spot.. whether it be a playoff card or whatnot.. they still will be in the post season.  I can't believe the lions fucked up and lost too!..  Gah, they should of had that PAT and the game should have been tied..  Talk about luck.  Vikings won on luck there!!  Next week should be interesting.  Vikings vs Packers.. and who ever wins will probably win the division.. GO PACK GO!  

So besides listening to the packer game at work, I did NOTHING!!  the mall was completely dead, I think we made our last sale at 7pm and the store closed at 9:30 today.. Normally the mall closes at 6 on sundays.. but since it's the last weekend of the holiday season, they had the mall stay open longer..  so Jenni and I sat and talked on the cushioned seats in the middle of the store and talked about random things.

We were talking about the super natural occurances, and things being haunted and such. Apparently the mall is haunted and their is this lady that comes out at night and roams the mall.  There has been a few people who has seen them, and from what she said sometimes the ghost makes her self known.  Like Jenni said once she was in the back of the store and pairs of shoes would fall off the shelve and no one would be around.

Oh, I saw my friend Kendra today at the mall, she came in with her mother to buy some boots.  She just got back from NYC.  She is living my dream life.  I envy her lol.  I tell her that everytime I see her too.  She is attending the music institute in NYC.  She says it's going very well and that I should come visit her out there sometimes. Little does she know i'll probably hold her to her word. 

I am going to go to bed.  I'm soo tired, and my mom wants me to go christmas shopping tomorrow with her.  I honestly think she is insane.  It was sooo busy this morning at work, but died down when the packer game started (obviously though.. we DO live in wisconsin LOL)  but yeah, I cant imagine how many people are going to shop tomorrow.. I'll let ya know!"

I shared some onion rings with my mother because I didnt want french fries, but I wanted something else to munch on while I was waiting for the sandwhich.

I wasted a few dollars because of my addiction to poker machines lol.  I put 3 dollars in, and lost it all *sniffles* what a piece of shit lol.  I did win a few games of darts, and I kicked some ass.  I'm great at darts.. but i'm done bragging about it lol

My life has been way to hectic to actually work on my webpage and make it successful.  Instead of wasting my time with that, I figured why not make it easier on myself!

As of lately i've become such a party animal.  The past week, I went out a total of 4 times and i'll probably be going out again tonight.  Why you ask?  Well in all honesty, I don't even have a real reason.  It just is better than sitting my ass at home and wasting my life ya know??

Ahh, it's such a nice feeling knowing everything seems to be going in the right direction.  I just landed myself the best job i've ever had.  I sell shoes!!  Yep, a female version of Al Bundy.. Go me!  But really, it's great selling shoes and did I mention I get myself DISCOUNTS!!!  I receive 30 percent off of all my purchases and also get 50% off on one pair of shoes a month.  That is a great amount of benefits.  It's gonna be nice.

Let's talk about DVDS now!  I just purchased 5 dvds for 12 dollars, My stupid self decided to join a dvd club.  Not that I didnt complain enough when I joined a CD club. But hey, All I have to do now is buy 5 dvds in the next 2 years.  I should be able to manage. 

Blah, i'm gonna end this one for now.  But i'll definately update frequently!!"

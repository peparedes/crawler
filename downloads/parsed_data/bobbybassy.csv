one i should post entries since i have one of these and i check posts everyday. but bleh.


two someone really needs to sit natalie and sean down and fucking bitch slap them.
sean needs to learn to sit and deal with his problems and not get lost in pot every fucking day.

and natalie....i dont know what to say about her anymore.
i remember she said she was going to be the best friend of mine for the rest of high school. but after the coccaine thing, i dont think i have respect for her. i think her and sean have been pretty much on the down hill since they got back together after the jimmy thing.

alll of first semster there was some probelm they had. then the coke thing, then just idk. all they do is fuck, sit around, and smoke up. i lost some close friends.
the only thign i can do is try and keep on speaking terms wth them since i never can let go of people for some reason. even if i dont hang out with someone, i cant let go. i should work on that. 
but its hard to even not snap at them since they ask me things like ""what would you do if matches put an ice cube up ur vag?"" you'd think they notice the tone in my voice i didnt like the question, but clearly not.

idk.

but cindy fi you want a better purse i can maybe make it if you find fabrics you want. i'm way better than before. i'll amdit the purse i made for me and you is shitty.

or i can take you to fabric places. idc. my car works finally."

"event","so anyways, thursday night/friday morning i was up till like 6 am. see i was going to go to bed at like 1ish or something, but then when i went downstairs to get Roxi and Ruby, i got into a stupid argument with Erik. It started off fun but then i got pissed off so i went downstairs(idky) and then kicked the wall. There's a hole now. SO then i went upstairs and found my stash of pixi sticks..there were 50. i downed 20 of them and then ate a muffin. Then i watched TV and was like COLORS TEEHEHE! and then i walked around the house with my eyes closed to see what it's like to be blinded. i ran into many a walls and stubbed my toes. owie. at this point i ate 10 more pixi sticks and 2 muffins. so now it's about 3:30ish. I went into the laundry room...in our laundry room we have this huge basket of socks that have no match and i made Sockville. Bundles of Socks were house and single socks were sock people. So there was Fred who was my favorite. Fred's wife Mrs. Fred was cheating on him with the Mayor, so he left her, causing Fred Jr. to be sad. Fred Jr. went out on a walk at night to find his dad's new house, and a hobo found him instead and then took him as is own son and they got on the SockExpress and left Sockville (which basically means you get thrown into the laundry chute cuz well that's what happens if you leave) So then Fred's at a bar, and his wife is diguised and sends him drinks, get's him drunk, and takes him home with her and has sex with him. He wakes up and says ""Leave me alone you goverment screwing whore"" but then falls over because he tripped over his foot and he has a massive hangover too. So this reoccurs every week, but not on the same day so Fred can't like keep track. Then finally he has his house packed up to move, but then comes home from work one day and his house isn't up for sale anymore. Because Mrs. Fred bought the house for them to live in. Fred goes to the train station and a giant comet hits the town and they all die. After sock ville i ate the rest of the pixi sticks and another muffin. i commented the longest and most random comment on Cierra's xanga and then walked around the house over and over and over again. around 5:45 i was in my room listening to Epoxies then at 6 i believe i was out. So anyways i'm also covered in bug bites from the bonfire at Bestys. they itch so. Hung out with Devin CIndy and Tom yesterday. We went to Record Breakers (bought another Bad Religion CD) and then the hot dog place. we were there for a while. we walked back to Devin's and were watching some TV. Cindy and Tom started complaining about being bored and they wanted to go on a walk and me and devo kept saying we don't want to go outside cuz it's too hot and i don't do well in the heat. so they left and me and devin ate apples and were chatting and twas funny. But then my mom had to pick me up early idky so i left earlyish like. I came home and the bites drove me nuts but then my mom got me anti-itch and twa its heaven! i also cleaned out my earrings and one of my cartaliges got like this bubble of blood or something on it and i tried like squeezing it out but it wasnt really working so i took that earring out so it can heal for a little bit. it happened again on my lobe on the other ear but i cleaned that out. So i started watching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but i was way to tried so i couldnt focus on it. but i'm gonna watch it tonight. i have bass lessons in a half an hour and then i think at 1:30 band practice. i'm going to try and learn devotchkas today. That list with the bands i like in ABC order isnt done yet but god there's more than 116 bands. gesse i listen to a lot. oh well.

"event","heyo peeps. update time yes??? so yesterday we went to my aunts boyfriends work place. he works in a charity thing building place of. it was cool in there. i talked to so many social workers so now i'm thinking about being one more. then we went to a bar cuz his friend's band was playing. I forgot her name, but she is the rencarnation of Janis Joplen. She sounds like her, looks like her, does the dance, but plays guitar too. So not only did i get into a bar (which was called the Saloon) i didnt get carded or nothing. It was fun. Then this old guy had brownies, and he offered them to us. He was friends with my aunt and her bf. So he's like ""Just so you know...these are magic brownies..."" and my aunts like meh and eats half of the piece she got and W.B. (bf) ate the rest. SO my aunt has become awesome because she's eating magic brownies in front of me and doesnt care but then later she's like ""Your mom's never going to let you come back here!!!"" IT WAS FUNNY. We went to China town and that was cool. Then we went to a hippie town. It was called the Haight, and i found the San Francisco version of Record Breakers. I bought Devochtkas, Bad Religion, and Iggy Pop. And some guy, who passed me on the street was talking to his friend, and when he passed me was like ""Punks dead sweetheart""....wtf. wtf? some guy, whos african american wearing a business suit basically, with dreadlocks and is holding drumsticks feels i need to know this. WHY DO I CARE?? twaaaaaa??? but anyways, i had taco bell by the beach and it was delicious. We went to Golden Gate Park and it was so beautiful in there, i rode on the giant merry-go-round. I made my aunt come w/ me. Then we walked through the gay neighbor hood and it was so cool. There was paintings everywhere and i was like AH! A guy came up to me and was like you have an awesome shirt!! And i gave him a peace sign, it was a natural reaction for some reason. he was cool and me made up for Mr. Punks Dead. So then we went back to the car and drove home. I think i feel asleep around 3? i also called Nat and we kept talking about how i'd beat her ass since i'm a pirate and she;s a ninja. She kept thinking she's win but she's a ninja so she's stupid. hahaha. Me and my aunt went Garage sale shopping this morning, Nothing really good, but when we went to some store i bought Devos present. I'm gonna get the other stuff later today, its only 12 here. OMG i forgot i had the most fucking awesome pizza yesterday! it was better than that place by Billys. hmmhmm. So i'm totally in love with Cali and i wanna come here for Collage now. So the following people r getting presents from me: Nat, CIndy, Jean, Heather, HEidi cuz she asked, Sean, Jeff and Cierra cuz i saw something yesterday that was Cierra like from our commnents on Xanga and myspace. teehehehehe. And only those people get gifts, well ym mom too. BUt i've been buuying a lot of food no duh, and so i need to limit spending...well we're off now. bu bye, going back home tomorrow morning sadly.

"event","omg Robert Plant was awesome last night.
i thought it was funny th-...well ok. Bonnie's favorite band is Led Zeppelin, her childhood/teenage life favorite  band, and by the time she sees the singer in concert she's wth her teenage daughter. she admitted it was a sad story. He did a lot of his solo stuff, but of course when a Zeppelin song came on i was singing along with it. I kept singing in Heathers ear. He played ""Black Dog"" which is one of my top 3 favs so i was like EIIII!!!!!!! but i was very tired too so when we got home Heather was watching anime and i fell asleep really quickly. So now i have to go mow the lawn, go to CVS for that rave hairspray Devo says i should get and then find my Distillers shirt and get dressed then do the liberty spikes. then Subhumans! there will be pics i can bet u. oh Heather's a doll cuz i bought some 10 gagues yesterday but i couldnt get the thing open enough to pop the ball back in, so i told her and she got me some new ones. and i love them so! so anyways off now. bu bye.

"event","*~*~{Dedicated to Devin and Cindy}~*~* so as most everyone who has some form of contact with me knows that the Epoxies show was last night....and it was fucking awesome. just wow. WEEEEEEEE!!!!! so first, it was fun when we were waiting outside for the doors to open cuz Nat had to pee but she wouldn't go in the bathroom across the street in the hotdog place cuz it was ""gross"" so we kept saying she should go in the dumpster. and then we get in at like 6:07 or something, and the show was suposed to start at 6:30 but it didn't till 7. The Phenominauts or something (YES GUYS I KNOW I SPELLED THE NAME WRONG) started, and they were awesome. The bassit was cool cuz he didn't use a usual electric bass. it was a string stand up bass. and he kept jumping around with it and i was like ""ah!"". So then we headed to the mosh pit, and Nat and Devo got seperated from us, but i had to keep holding onto Cindy cuz she's tiny so she woulda been killed ya know? I fell at one point and someone stepped on my stomach. ow. So then they stopped and we had a coke, and i mean we cuz we all drank from the same sup. Nat got Cindy a cigg from this cool guy who was really nice. THen we headed back into the pit, and Roxi of the Epoxie's came onstage to switch her microphone and Devin yelled I LUV U! and waved and Roxi said hi back. Devo was in bliss. So then they started playing and omg i love them so much now cuz it was veyr happy la-la swaying/skanking/jumping dancing. Some guys started dancing with Devin and then he danced with me, but Devin was still in the middle. They kept dancing everynow and then through the set.  I love Roxi, she's like Adam Ant, but female. And she's got the most awesome dance i've ever seen. ^_^. Then we were dead. Ok, Cindy Devin and Nat were dead. I had some energy left for the Aqua Bats. They live up to their rep. They suck at music but have the best show!!!!! Devo went with me in the pit for a bit but she was dead, and some guy grabbed the back of my Ramones shirt and all the safety pins came undone. So then we left and went back to the speakers with Nat and Cindy. I then spent like 15 mins repinning everything. the Aqua Bats were so funny. they did a cover of ""Don't Stop Believeing"" and that is the only time in my life i will ever like that song, but it was funny cuz a clip of bigfoot was on this screen that was playing random shit. The show ended around 10:30ish, and who was outside selling and signing Cd's? ROXI!!!! So i bought the CD and she signed it! and then i told her my dog was named Roxi too, and she's like ""awesome, my name's not really."" and i'm like ""it is in my heart"". And then then she signed Devo's arm. She's so awesome i love Roxi. It's cool cuz now that the Distillers broke up this weekend and Brody's turned herself into such an object, i have a new love/idol: Roxi of course. Me and Devo have agreed that i'm going to spike my liberty spikes for the Subhumans concert sunday. Which is cool cuz 1) we can be spike buddies again, and 2) i havent put those up in so long. i'm so burised, but they don't show up which kinda sucks. oh well. it was awesome. So today the whores are coming over to watch ""Garage Days"". lol that movie's funny. especially the acid parts. so that was my awesome night. latas!!!!

"event","1. Pick a band and answer only using the band's song titles: SR-71
2. Are you male or female: ""She was Dead""
3. Describe how you feel about yourself: ""Broken Handed""
4. Your best piece of advice: ""The Best has Yet to Come""
5. Describe your last relationship: ""Goodbye""
6. Describe your current crush: ""Another Night alone""
7. Say something to someone you have a crush on: ""In My Mind"" 
8. Say something to an ex: ""Truth""
9. Say something to someone who you hurt severely: ""Alive""
10. How do you feel right now: ""Lucky""
Now answer the same questions using only lines from the songs you selected above for the same question...

2. Are you male or female? From the minute that I met here she was different than the rest, But I didn't hear her talking I was staring at her chest, And I wish I would have listened 'cause I think I might have seen the signs. Now it's been a couple months and I can't take another word, She's been pushing every button she's been working every nerve.

3.Describe how you feel about yourself:I'm a Broken Handed Superman. You're a Krypto-Nightingale Snow White. Now I understand. It's something I understand, Some things I understand

4. Your best piece of advice: If you could lock the past away, Step back through the doorway, This ride has just begun. If I could change your point of view...Is there someway I can show you? The best is yet to come

5. Describe your last relationship:Don't you hear me when i say, Goodbye...so long...nice try...I'm gone. You don't like being second, I don't like being wrong
I won't forget the way you made me feel, I won't regret running away from here. You think you see the world well you see nothing. Time is only gonna make it worse in the end...So I'll say goodbye again

6. Describe your current crush: Alone again tonight, In this empty time, The sound in my head, The sight leaves me blind

7. Say something to someone you have a crush on: Can you see me trying to wave you down tonight? 'Cause I need to see you one more time. You'll always be there in my mind, In my dreams you can hide, And every night I'm gonna bring you back to life

8. Say something to an ex: Blood and dust have changed all the colors in my mind, Black has made me see but the truth has made me blind, To the fears, To the lies...They were here All the time

9. Say something to someone who you hurt severely: All she's asking is for a little more time, To walk away from his anger and leave the bruises far behind
She won't talk about it...she's made up her mind
 
10. How do you feel right now? i know it's not considered right, The way I live my days and nights, I always thought I'd rather be considered lucky than good, And I know it's not considered right and everyday's another fight, I'd rather be lucky than good.
tahaha

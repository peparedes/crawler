That i have no respect for her, that i'm just saying these things to be a horrible little ass hole. He wants me to look myself in the mirror and see what a dick i am. But earlier when i was sobbing and trying to explain to him how i felt and why i was upset over the things he had said, he didn't give a shit. Then actually got angry at me for raising my voice alittle. He is so fucking negative and uncaring during arguments, and totally contradicts himself. It's a fucking power struggle for him. I'm so tired of it."

"event","Throughout the years of my falling tears
i never thought it would change
the falling leaves, the new borne grass
the seasons changing, forget the past.

I was nieve, i still am. 
i want to change 
what i couldn't see.

I want to start over
try again
reconcile my demons
reaquaint with the angels.
The angels alive
the angels dead
the angels protecting 
some passed over with not a second thought.

why do we insult without really knowing? 
without thinking of how it effects others...and more profoundly...us. i thought i was a good person, that i cared, that i truely loved. but no. once in a while, i'm not, and i feel like shit when i see how it effects...me. fucking karma. not it's not really though, because these aren't physical ramafications (spelling?) these just render mental torture....questioning what really happened? how she saw me...what kind of person i was to her. did i have anything to do with her death? does it matter? i can't help me feelings, i can't stop this...horrible cycle of questions, wondering, these feelings of betrayal. ""she killed herself"" she said. ""what? whatever dude."" ""no i'm not kidding...why would i joke about shit like that?"" ""...because you're laughing...and smiling...are you serious?"" *me thinking to myself, and KNOWING that laughing is a ""natural"" defence mechanism to divert feelings, and more accurately:cover them up* ""yeh i'm not kidding."" ""when did she do it?"" ""April 27th..."" ""why? i mean...how?"" ""i don't know...overdose probably..."" *me thinking that her, being her BEST fucking FRIEND would know how she died.* 

This hurts. i feel like a bitch. i feel like an ass, and i hate it. 

she wasn't that close to me, but...did i treat her okay? that whole relationship was just....crap. it was unhealthy, and they were not MENTALLY healthy. oh god...this is so vauge. i have this...demon now...i don't know the word. damn. somthing that i'll have a problem with for a long time, trying to understand and get over.

on a lighter note... i really really like summer, and i'm so psyched that it's all sunny out. its great. no school soon...YES! and with sun, inevitably (spelling?) comes with SERATONINS BEING RELEASED!!! yay!! increased thought process and reasoning, understanding. its a beautiful thing. i actually feel smart. my immense vocabulary, with horrible spelling is coming back, but with minor hiccups of absent-mindedness. i can figure things out a hell of a lot quicker. no getting depressed allowed. maybe if i keep my brain functions up for a long long time, it'll become permanent. and i do mean forever, not just random relapses. so. that's life. and stupid emo poems...then my really vauge explanation of my little chat with jennifer yesterday. i guess i should explain alittle. Jennifer= ex-girlfriend...who was...well she had issues. when i ""Went out with her"" she was getting over...wow i don't even know how to explain it. she has some fuck'd mental issues, so does her b.f. megan. jennifer and megan could never be seen seperate. they fucking did everything together, and to an extent that bugged me, cause i wanted to be alone with jen. but we only...whaatever we did for a week or so. megan was cool...but she was weird. i got weird vibes from her. and jennifer. so yeh. i was nice to megan, but, i don't know. when someone dies you always do this. i've seen jennifer at a few shows the past like, 2 weeks, and megan was never with her...i wondered but i never asked....then i did. it started by ""hey wheres...dammit...whats her face, the one with the curly hair...tool hoody (she ALWAYS wore that)?"" i honestly didnt remember her name. yeh. so that kinda bummed me out, but i still had fun.
also i feel like a dick cause vanessas friend, sarah, who i'm pretty damn sure likes me...well i flirt alot cause im an ass and anyways i hung out with sarah alittle and not like we're going out or ANYTHING i felt bad for talking to other chicks. but i met this girl Dani, who iono, she's kewl, but, this is shallow, has lots of shit in her life and i honestly dont wanna get involved, i want a HEALTHY relationship. keyword RElATIONSHIP. but yeh me and Dani were holding hands, go outside Bitoz and Sarah sees us, and leaves our little circle or talkingness. i dont know if it's related at all...but whatev."

"event","so it's pretty late, but today *looks at clock*...errrr...yesterday i slept waaaay too much. and i should be reading, but i'm not. i did clean my room a tiny bit, which felt good. but then i slept some more. i'm slightely depressed. Prom was really fun, but...iono. i just wish vanessa went. makes me kinda sad. see she was gonna go, we had it all planned out. i was gonna pick her up at 4:00 ish, meet katie, jeff and max at outback, then after me and v. stopping by my bro's b-day party at jewel lake park, and katie, m. and j. stopped at the museum to help with decorations, we would go to katies, get dreessed then go to prom. sounds complicated, but really it should have worked. 

so go early, stop at the store, get my tux, then go to vanessa's. she says we have to wait for Miles to get back before she can leave. so we wait...and wait...and then i remember she needs i.d. to get into the dance. one problem. it's locked in her mom's room and she's at work. so somthing happens with her having to wait for her mom, and all her friends being over at her house, getting into trouble she can't leave. so after a bit of convincing she tells me to go ahead and pick me up after. i tell her i'll bring her food. so on my way to outback, jeff calls and says he's running late, so we all go to katies house for a while to wait for him, then max who is ALWAYS late. oh well...no biggie right? we get to the restaurant, it's all dandy, but i'm a little sad. i cheer up after a while, order my food, end up having to just box it up and take it with me cause i have to actually get to my bro's party before it ends. that was fine though, we had appitzers so i was kewl*. i drive all the way across town, stop by the party for prolly a total of 2 minutes, give ben my food from outback...he makes fun of me for giving it to him at a bbq. oh well. all his friends look at me funny when i walk up and give him a hug. they all know he has a little sister, but don't know what ""she"" looks like. kinda surprising when this big, hot jock who's all popular has a fucking bulldyke sister eh? so i take off and head to vanessa's again. i try calling her, someone picks up, but the reception is horrible and they can't hear me. i head over there anyways.

she isn't there. i drive to her g'mas to see if she's chillin outside, but don't see her...so i swing by her house again. no luck. i descide to go to the store and buy a new lighter cause i left mine at home, go back to her house, and smoke on her porch. still not home. i fucking go BACK to her g'mas... ask if she's there. nope. drive back to her house. nope. (her grandma lives only a few blocks down and you have to drive past v's house to get out to a main road.) i go to katies house. they ask where she is, i say ""good question"" and start to cry. i get dressed, feeling pretty hot, bot my hair all kewl, gave jeff a fohawk which was cute, then i try vanessa before we head out. she's home. imagine that. i don't say anything cause i hate being mean to friends. she says she has to wait for her mom to get home...and that she can't find her i.d. anywhere (her mom's bf came home with the key). i drive over there...at this point it's about 8:30, the time we were planning to show up at prom. i watch wild wild west with them, and stay there till about 9:15, when after i give her her food...she calls her mom. mom says she can't go and that she's out in birchwood getting drunk. great. so i go to prom. alone. but it was still fun and i had a great time. 

i have descided that i can't deal with competing with her boyfriend, all the drama with her friends, they're constant lyeing, stealing, drugs, alcohal...it's bad. i can tell vanessa doesnt want to be involved with all that stuff..but she's in too deep now. all they do is sit on they're asses all day, smoke and take any pills they can find. it's pretty crappy and i know i would deffinetly get involved with that stuff if i gave myself half a chance. i just want a healthy RElATIONSHIP. no friends with benefits, so bi girls who will drop any girl for a guy, no drugs, no girls with boyfriends. i want to meet her, be her friend, then go out with her. actual dates. and i can be patient i know that. i think i can even tell girls who are interested in me, or i am interested in what iwant now. but i think...that when i talk to vanessa again, iono. i'm prolly just gonna mess around with her still. if i knew how to put this behind a cut, i would cuase this post is really fucking big. life is still good though, this hasnt gotten me down too much, and i'm more than muddling through, i'm not even swimming upstream. i'm floating downstream...awwwwwwwwwwwwwwrriiiight.  

*note: for some reason i've barely been eating lately, just not hungry and nothing sounds good...so i'm getting all skinny, which is a good thing"

"event","sooo...i realized that i complain alot in livejournal, and i'm sure in real life too...so i'm going to work on being more optamistic. Katie has a bf. jeff. he's kickass, kinda arrogant a bit, dorky, it's silly cause he tries to be all smart and look like he knows everything 'specially around katies dad...and her dad ALwAYS makes him look dumb. its funny...but not too, cause i feel bad for jeff...he's gonna take me on his motorcycle when he gets it WOOT!! okay so another thing to be happy about...is prom. it should be fun, i get to go with vanessa. and i signed up fuckin 4 other people. i can't wait. i'm gonna look like such a dork/dyke in my tux. ya know what? i'm lucky that i'm well liked at steller cause at a traditional school, my ass would be dead dude, i shit you not. speaking of getting beat up and shot...i have to go to texas this summer to see relatives. shit. i'm so scared, i'm desperately thinking of ways to avoid it. if my relatives don't kill me first, i know the general population will. *sigh* i'm gonna buy a taszer (spelling?) before i go down. SHIT i'm being positive!!! arghh. oH my cat is being really nice and cuddly lately it's so nice, he doesnt bite me and he lets me cuddle with him. i can actually move him now with out him running off and he sometimes stays. 
*sigh* for some reason i keep trying to refer to vanessa...as jennifer...and that's really bad. i totally dont like jennifer anymore, but she fucked me up, and i'm still getting over that. i know that vanessa is good for me though. she's a really chill person. happy time."

"event","Me. first of all... i don't understand me. it's so complicated, i wish it could be simple. second...WHY THE FUcK DO I FREAK OUT ABOUT STUPID SHIT!?!?!?! okay...now let me give you some background to this second comment.

So last entry which was a looong time ago, i wrote about how Patti gave me Vanessa's number. she called, we hooked up...she has a boyfriend. sorta. His name is Miles, and he fucking LIVES with her. she said she doesn't like to be bound down, that she is very open, that she loves her freedom. He thinks/wants it to be serious. they've only been going out for a month. from what she's said about him, i know that she's getting annoyed with him cause he's so clingy. and she sees him everyday so she's tired of him. So... me and vanessa have hung out a few times, Bitoz, and once at her house for a few hours...that was really fun. until Miles came in from skating. then we went to carrs and it was fun again. i don't know...it's really frustrating because when he's around, he gets priority, seeing as he's the boyfriend, and i'm the...what? what am i to her? toy? friend...with benefits? she wrote me this not that was all cute saying she really liked me and wants to take it further and that miles doesnt need to know...oh thats good...i'm supporting her CHEATING on her fucking boyfriend. DAMMIT!! am i a bad person? I really like her she makes me feel sooo incredibly loved, wanted and cared for...she's gorgeous, has an awesome voice. man. but the thing is... it's so retarded, but when she doesnt call me when she says she will or whatever i freak out. cause from my experienced...and what i did to ashley, you stop talking to the person if you wanna break it off. it's what always happens and i hate it. i hate it sooo much. it makes me feel like complete shit. i don't know why...it really shouldn't and really, in this case, it's probably nothing. i really wanna hang out with her at least once more before prom, but she is busy. she's going around applying for all these jobs. When we're together, everything is fine. man if we didn't even mess around at all and i could just be her friend, that would be fine cause, iono, we just have awesome conversations, they flow, they aren't fake, its like i've known her for a while. don't get me wrong, i'm not in love with her or anything, she's just a really kewl person. 
so moral of this story IIIISSS: wait for her to call you, don't call her everyday, if she doesnt call you before friday...maybe even saturday, then call her. I JUST WANNA SPEND TIME WITH HER ALONE!! NO MILES, NO OTHER FRIENDS. grrr."

"event","OMG. i'm fucking tired of all their bullshit!!! every single goddamned time i talk they tell me i'm being rude, a snot, a brat, to get that tone out of my voice...FUCK!!!! does it not occur to them that THEY may be the grumpy sensitive ones? it pisses me off sooo much. i start out not grumpy at all, but maybe fuckin grunt an answer instead of saying ""yes ma'am"" or whatever and they yell at me...so OBVIOUSLY i'm gonna get annoying when you wrongfully accuse me. YEH FUCK YOU MOM. god. okay so my dad is like ""sarah turn down your music!!! this is the third time in a ROW i've heard this song!!!!"" i said ""what? no it's not....today?"" ""yeh today. right NOW"" ""umm....no it's not...it's on a continuos run, not repeat. and it's all different songs"" ""no it's not sarah! don't call me a liar, i'm the one hearing it! look on your computer at your playlist just look how many times it's played!!!!"" *i look* ""no dad, it hasnt played it more than once, i've been here the whole time."" ""FINE then it's the same band playing the same scenes. but don't lie to me!!!!"" ""DAD it's not even that big of a deal! why does it matter so much??"" ""yes it IS a big deal, because you tell me the truth."" WHAT THE HELL?!?!??!!? JESUS CHRIST it's fucking MUSIC, it's not even that loud, not worth getting an anuerism over shit. they get so pissed at me all the time, it makes me feel like shit. they stomp all over me, i try to redeem myself and they practically crucify me. such shit. Lara said i could stay at her house for a while though, which is good. i really really need it. i get more and more depressed every time i talk to them. i want to pop pills again, and cut myself and drive my car into a lightpole. but i won't i just have to wait until i can move out. 

my manager, rolando, the new, incompetant one is such....*sigh*. it's horrible. he's writing me up because i supposedly ""am not there whenever we need you"" he wanted me to work SMOOTHIE till 10:30...which would prolly be more like 11:00...when i was working as hostess. first of all...smoothie is not my job, he should have ASKED someone else, like a cashier or expo first. second, i WAS FUCKING DONE WITH HOSTESSING AND ABOUT TO CLOCK OUT...i went in to ask him if i could go cause the servers said it was slow enough for me to go. he goes ""sure you can go...oh but sarah, you have to work smoothie till 1030."" he said i HAD to, that there was no one else to do it (cause he's a fucking dumb ass and sent people home early). i was PISSED. it really doesnt sound like that big of a deal, but i was ready to go. and it's not even my JOB!!! so i cooled off for 5 minutes then asked to talk to him again, and camly explained that i didn't think it was my responsibility to work it, and that i didn't appreciate how he gave me no choice. then he said ""well i'm gonna have to write you up, this just shows that you aren't there for us when we need you."" okay...that pissed  me off like no other. but i stayed calm (on the outside) and said that i didn't think that was fair considering i'm one of the hardest workers and that this was the first time it has happened. so anyways, i'm haveing a meeting with him and another manager on friday. i punched my locker really hard when i was getting ready to go home (i told him i wasn't gonna work...politely though, not that blunt) then i punched the door to go outside. it really hurt, but it felt better.

anyways i called my mom and told her i was really pissed and i needed to go to Bitoz to hang out with friends to cool off...which she was really pissed about but i told her that i was going even if she didnt want me to. i knew that if i went home i would either pop pills, sneak out and go to one of the 3 parties i got invited to, get drunk and drive home. but bitoz turned out really really good. at first it kinda sucked cause not many people were there that i knew, shawn, chris, kayla...cailey...yeh thats it. oh and dan. so shawn comes up to me and says ""hey sarah you have to talk to this chick for me."" so i did. he pointed her out... i walked up to her, asked her name, introduced myself..then said ""my friend thinks...quoting him....you're really fucking hot."" ""oh really?"" ""yeh are you available or anything?"" ""yeh i am...who is he"" i pointed him out...""are you interested?"" ""yeh i think so"" i asked if i should bring him over or what and she said that he should just say ""hi"" to her somtime that night....THEN she said...""yeeeh my sister thinks you're the hottest thing in the world, she's all hanging off my arm telling me all night... she thinks you're gorgeous."" ""huh...really? that's kewl."" ""yeh she wants to go out with you"" ""i'm looking for a girlfriend so that works out. is she here?"" ""no"" then we talked for a bit and i gave her my # to give to her sister: venessa. she described her, and thinking about it when i got home, i realized venessa was this girl that i had thought was really cute and i caught looking at me prolly 5 times in one night... we checked each other out sooo much, it was awesome!!! but of course i'm shy and i can't talk to girls. damn me. so hopefully she'll call me really soon, that would be kickass...and it gave my ego a boost which is really really nice. brings it up from the shit i feel like cause of my parents. SO that's me lately."

"event","i'm kinda sad today but i don't know why. work was good, school was really fun. i got to help the cooking intensive...cook. duh. germaine looked like she really needed a hand so i pitched in. it was awesome. i like alot of the kids in the class, they are all cheer and shit. work was kewl cause igot off early...which on the way home i realized i didn't really want to do. i don't understand my reasoning sometimes. all of us at work had a good time messing around and shit. shawn keeps taking my keys from my pocket (they're on one of those long things..don't know what they're called, but it hangs out of my pocket) and somtimes i dont even notice. grr. it makes life interesting. so supposedly i'm a snowman now, according to cody. what a weird fuck. cody was really really bummed and lethargic at the beginning of the workday though, becaues he was really good friends with the three brothers that got murdered by their fucking mother. damn. i thought MY mom was fuck'd. but he cheered up luckily. no one will understand this but ""what sea creature am i?"" cody asks, (we're just trying to have fun at work...he's being a dumbass) *cody makes some weird motion that slightely resembles a jellyfish. ""jelly fish"" i said non-chalantly(spelling?) *cody is really surprised and looks like a 5 year old...and sounds like one too*  ""WOW!!! how'd you guess that so fast??"" it was fuckin halarious. i started crying i laughed so hard. he looked like a little kid when they get really excited. o.m.g. 
but yeh. i'm sad now. i think it's mostely cause i really really want there to be a (dance) club for gay teens. *sigh* i want to sneak into mad myrnas. i wanna see a drag show. i want to meet some more gay kids who aren't immature and all into fuckin anime and make kitty noises. the whole gothy thing too. it's getting really annoying. WHY CAN'T SOMEONE HIT ON MEEEEE????? arrrgh.
whatev. k i just typed this big long rant, but descided against showing it. meh. i'm tired of bitching. i'm tired of being depressed. i'm scared cause i'm getting depressed again and i'm drinking too much, and i can't stop smoking, i'm tired of being tired. i'm sick of having bad self-esteem. i fucking HATE, despise, the fact that there aren't more fucking butch girls here. i hate homophobes. i hate that i'm still scared to go out into parking lots alone, even when it's light out. i hate being scared of every fucking silver truck that pulls next to me. i'm tired of getting glares, of people telling me that i'm in the wrong bathroom. i'm hate that i'm not proud. i hate that i can't cry anymore and i keep it inside. i hate being called miss, lady, girl, ma'am. i hate that i don't know what i am. why couldn't it have been easy? no confusion, no questions, no endless nights not being able to sleep because i'm trying to fucking figure my god DAMNED self out. why can't i hit on girls without feeling guilty? why can't i have a happy, functioning family? why do i feel like shit and am scared to ask for my parents to buy me somthing stupid, like juice. why does my mom yell at me for asking for somthing as simple as juice, just cause it has too much sugar in it? i hate drama. i hate that i have to buy my own fucking food. i want to leave my house, but i dont want to have ALL my money go to rent and car insurance. i hate that i hate myself. i hate that i am self-loathing. i hate that i hear songs in my head and i hear every single part, every note, but it haunts me because it won't go away. i hate that i ONLY remember music and i can't remember anything else. i hate that there is ALWAYS a song in my head and the only way to shut it up is to blare music, or the tv or somthing, but that only lasts for a while. then i just hear both songs. at the same time. the beats don't match though. i need a fucking break, but i jsut had one. in fact i'm having one now, thanks to intensives. i should save up lots of money and leave state for a while. yeh right. 

well...looks like i ended up ranting again, about somthing else. or many things as the case may be. meh."

today i had a craving for cinnomon rolls, so i went to freddy's and bought some, as well as a load of bread for my parents, a SoBe Courage, some of that scrumptious King's Hawaiian sweet bread, a little packet of gummy vitamins (just wanted to try em.)...and i think that was it. i went to u-scan and only had $1's from tips, so it took a long time to pay. luckily only one got rejected. it was $11.47 so i put 12 in. duh. but yeh it really was annoying. i wanna go shopping, but i have no money yet. pay-day on the 3rd  WOOT!"

"event","i don't really know what i'm writing about. this post has no purpose...or at least direction at this point, so i think i'll just start rambling and hopefully my mind will construct some order around my random thoughts. *pauses*
so....how about them yankees? no. okay so work is going well. i'm lovin my internship. meeting some really awesome people. and i start REALLY cooking on...tomorrow. 2-5. it'll be on the grill side, and according to the b-e-a-Utiful jamie i'll prolly be a ""fry bitch."" yeeehpp. makin *thinks* shit i dont even know what they fry besides the little tortilla shells for salads. whatev. I WANT A GUITAR!
OMG okay so i went to sierra's mom's house so me and sarah g. could go climbing. at 1, she said we'd go around 2, so at 2 i left, thinking that i could stop at fred meyers and by the time i got done there, they'd have called me, saying they were heading to the rock gym. but they didn't. so i called her, she said to just come over...so obviously i did. got there and sierra sez ""sarah's in the shower""..which was random. then i walked in (never been to her house) and she's like ""this is sam (who's a girl) sarage (spelling?) my mom...mom you remember dylan?"" i say hi or somthing, then she turns around and says ""dylan, shane, shane, dylan...sarah"" he reaches out to shake my hand and says ""hey girlie, nice to meet you"" okay i must say he has a really soft touch and kind eyes and beautiful smile. probably one of the nicest first impressions i'd had. then he says""dylan, sarah? those are really different names"" and i mutter somthing about likeing dylan better, and how people at school call me that and he asks which one i am now, and i say dylan. sooo anyways, i run upstairs to find sierra who has left me, in a roomful of people i don't know (ahhh! social anxiety!!!) and i was like...okay so who are those people?...apparently her mom and sam had just met shane (who was COOKING) just this past weekend and he is now dating sam's best friend, jo..or joe, not sure. yeeeh. odd. and they'renow like best of friends, in the family already haha. he's really smart, funny, flirty, i think i love him! haha, he's so sweet. 
later, we were all upstairs talking (sarah was  out of the shower at this point), and it was like we were all a family or somthing, i mean we all got along, cared for each other. it made me sad alittle, because i so rarely witness functioning ""families"" or variations there-of and it was just a really awesome experience. i dont know why it moved me so much but it did. anyways. we ended up talking till like 4, when we finally did go climbing, which was awesome and i'm really sore from. man i can't really describe the whole thing, so someone should ask me about it, so i can spread the love hehe."

"event","drag dance was a highely anticipated night. wrongfully anticipated really. toooo much drama going on there. actually not really there. so there was a whole deal with.... a few people who must remain nameless, which involve being piss-drunk, bats, anger, jealousy, cheating, revenge and...oh my it was just horrible. but my ex jennifer went with her best friend megan and THAT was just crappy. fuckin, she and megan just talked the whole time, barely danced, ignored me when i tried to talk to them, *sigh*. it was not fun. Then they just fuckin left and didnt even say bye. assholes. yeh so i'm done with jennifer. she treats me like shit. 
BUT that was just the bad parts of the dance. really, the dance was KICK-ASS!!! waaaaay too many hot people in drag. haha. Josh- may i say you are a fine ass motha fucker! you should be a chick more often. ;) katie and milo came over to get dressed which was fun. katie looked pretty cute. and of course milo looked good in this dragon shirt i love. lol anyways, sarah g. damn yeh she looked good in her guy pants cause i've never seen her in guys pants. tana was HOTT tho. wife beater, baggy pants, boxers. DAMN. geneva had the samn look goin on and was too hot to be straight. NOT FAIR!!! so there was lots of eye candy, not too much rap, but shitloads of really really good muzik. *sigh* i guess it turned out good.

theres a whole shitload of new people people at work, which is okay, but sad cause i miss some of the old people. BUT! josh is gonna start there tomorrow!!! ROCKK ON!!! yeh bitch. and i start my internship in the bear tooth theater/pub kitchen tomorrow too. i'm nevervous, but i think i'll do okay. theres this one chick though, melissa who i guess worked there before and everyone thought was a bitch who took my fuckin thursday hostessing shift. fuckin bitch. i worked so hard to get that and they didnt even talk to me about it. i feel like i got slapped in the face. fucking seniority. but the thing is, without connecting the two, on friday i went to Bitoz with chandra and met her friend MELISSA-who i was told was starting work there again. then we went to chandras boyfriends house, bullshitted, had good times, drank a coupla beers...and when driving home... i made the fuckin connection. melissa, took my shifts, seems like a kewl kid, was told she's a bitch, want my shifts BACK, but now dont want to complain. argh. 

meh. life is good right now...sorta. i'm doing okay if i keep busy, but i think i need a break from my house again. SomEOne PleASe hiT oN mE!!!!!"

"event","so yesterday i woke up at 9, jumped in the shower, then headed to brunch at village inn which i got to at 10:15ish (started at 10) and amazingly i wasnt stressed for being late. so as i was walking towards the door, i couldnt really see in cause there was a glare, but as i got closer i saw alex. I opened the door and saw alex, then jennifer, then alex again, then megan, then lana...and i was like WhOA. lotsa people. and it was strange...seeing jennifer. and it wasnt weird which was kick ass. but yeh we had to wait a while for them to have enough room to seat us, which was fine cause we all got to talk lots. aaand i think me and jennifer were flirting throughout brunch. so i'm prolly gonna call her tonight and see if she wants to hang out somtime. anyways, skipping way ahead, when we were leaving (i was giving 3 people rides over to uaa to the conference thingy) alex comes over and is like hey gareth wants to know if at this party tonight he can do body shots off you. i was like uhhh...sure. and he hands me the phone on which gareth is on the other end. obviously. gareth babbles somthing about wanting to do body shots and how since all the other girls are taken, a lesbian is better than no one..and i was just like okay, whatever. *sigh* good times. so then i meet everyone over at uaa and theres this career fair going on. i descide to wander a bit since the class didnt start for another 10 minutes. 
so wander i do. and i see this really really cute girl in a tank top and kinda short hair, like ear length. she does a double take when she sees me and grins. so i go grab lana to tell her. it was funny, i was all happy and jumping up and down and so me and lana wander more to look for her again. after a few minutes i was like ""damn i dont see her"" ""OH SHIT look there she is."" and as we walked by her, our eyes met and held for like 5 seconds and right when she passed us she check me out!!! i was sooo happy!!! so i descided i was gonna give her my number, and wrote it down and found her, but then i got scared. fuck me. i hate being shy. but yeh. i flirted with lana some which was fun. i was in a flirty mood i guess. 
i'm interested in lana, i think she's cute and has a cool personality, but she is a bit shy somtimes, but that's not necessarily a turn-off, just means we need to get to know each otehr more. but see the thing is, i kinda wanna get back with jennifer...and lana and jennifer ""dated"" sorta. and ellen likes lana. so its all complicated and fuck'd. but yeh, on thursday there's the drag dance and both of them are going, plus many others from the gsa's. i'm really pumped and have a feeling i'm going to be really really flirty and really really horny by the end of the night. it'll be fun. but i don't want to upset anyone with my undecisivness. i think i mostely wanna see if jennifer is still interested in me. she's adorable and is a really really good kisser. 
but okay, so after the conference thing i went to work which was fun and had some awesome conversations with the new girl mary(who i'm attracted to), bill, and trey. it started out when i went out to smoke. they were already out there around the table in the smoke shack, and the flood like all of a sudden turned off, so we were thrown into complete darkness... (hehe reminds me of i believe in a thing called love, by the darkness...anywhoo) and i was like oh shit. i can't see in the dark very well. so i was like ""damn i cant see"" mary says ""just feel your way"" and grins, looking into my eyes (i could see her eyes hehe-DUH) and this happened to be right when i was squezzing in between her and the table...i laughed and trey was like ""oh, too bad the lights not on, i wanna see this"" it was halarious, but then mary asked somthing about gay marriage, and trey asked her if she was lesbian or anything. she said no... but later, i actually worked up the courage enough to ask her if she was bi. she said somthing along the lines of ""i don't know, i've never dated a girl, but have experimented, i still dont know though"" but i do know she wants to be single, so i'm not gonna try to come on to her at all. i don't really mind, but it's frustrating. i wish there were real gaydars, so i wouldnt be so shy flirting with people i dont really know. 
anyways, after work, when alex, gareth, chuck and this other dude got out of catillion we went out to the party in girdwood. it was good times, cept the host was throwing up when we got there, and the two couples, which were the only other people, went to bed/went to have sex kinda early. but yeh alex got really really stoned and it was funny. but i got to try absynthe (the non-hallucinagenc form). its awesome. it's 150 proof, bright green, and tastes like black liqourish. i think its my new favorite. we did some tequila shots and at 1:30ish i went home. i was prolly too drunk to drive, but by the time i got home, i was only a little dizzy. i need to cut back cause i've been drinking way too much. like 3 weekends in a row, and like 5th time already this month. well maybe 5th time in 3-4 weeks. whatever. NEW STATIONS AT KCC TOMORROW!! NO MORE ASSHOLE DAVIS!! suck it bitch."

"event","tooooday...i went to my culinary arts class at KCC which was kewl. chef Numi is nice. i got a locker and a chef hat and coat and all that good stuff so me and chris and iris can all pimp it together. woot! I DONT KNOW HOW TO WORK COMBINATION LOCKS!!! damn steller for it's alternativness...grrr. stupid lockers. i felt like a retard. anyways. then i went back to school, to Plato, worked on that for a bit, got bored and slacked, went to my civil war class which was pretty fun and relaxing. cept the teacher dude was getting annoyed with us cause we got off track alot. then i got another massage which was veeery nice. 
almost too nice. i feel so relaxed and calm after, but i'm sticky from the oil/gel stuff she uses and the back of my hair is all messed up. o well tho. yeh i can't afford anymore though, so i'm just gonna have to suck it up. then i came home, took a quick bath, was ready to eat dinner, but it wasnt ready yet, went to work, almost fainted...which i came really REALLY close to doing during KCC for some reason...and a few other times today. its very odd, and slightely scary. but work was fun, we all had fun kicking each other and throwing random items at each other. it helps lighten the mood when there's a crap load of people there. BUT FUCKIN KYLE WONT STOP DOING MY JOB!!! argh!!! you're a fuckin expo so do your goddamed job! he's a little over-achiever. grrr. it really frustrates me. okay so expos are usually supposed to help the servers when theres NO hostess, as soon as one is there, they stop and focus on their job. yeh so i really dont have to do too much while hostessing, it's just that alot of it is running bus tubs back and forth and stocking andn that takes time. (okay just so you know, he's not ""helping"" cause i suck at my job, because they all tell me that i'm the best hostess they have-it's seniority for the job, but i got the job over a 20 year old, 22 and 23 year old so BUH-YA) he just hangs around the server station, gets in the way and makes feeble attempts to help. but say i'm bussing a table, i get back and the bus tub that was only 1/2 full...is gone. dumbass doesnt even do the job right. it gets on my nerves SO much that it makes me not want to do my job at all. i'm just like ""well he's doing it, why should i too?"" but that's immmature. arrrghghghhgh!!! it's like the one thing that really really pisses me off. that and slackers. so over-achievers who suck at over-achieving, and slackers are the two things that just.....*sigh* o well. 
so then i came home, and ben was here eating dinner with the 'rents and...yeh me and him had a little talk...about me...and it, well, it didn't turn out as well as i'd hoped it would, but there is potential. maybe. wow. that was vauge. but it's gonna stay like that so HA! aaaand!!!! he sold me lots of shirts for 20 bucks, which are mine, and the use of anything else in his closet as long as its returned washed, and if necessary, ironed. yup. OOOHHH!! and i stretched my ears like an hour before i went to work and it hurt like a BITCH! dear lord! yeh i didn't have a 12 gauge, so i jumped from 14, to 10. ouch. i had to just push it through, but it doesnt hurt now. i still have to do the other side though. damn."

soooo i gotta tell you this funny (sorta) story. okay so this guy i work with, cody comes up to me and goes ""hey my friend soandso wants to meet you"" i was like *blink blink* ""wait what?"" and he's like ""yeh dude she saw you when she came here to see me the either day and she's like 'hey you scoping out any chicks for me' and i was like 'well there's a few...try to guess which ones' so she pointed to you and said you're cute and that she wants me to introduce her"" i was like SCORE!!! it made me happy and made me feel wanted. WOOT!! yeh the weird thing about cody though is that he's my ex's cousin...which i didn't know until after we were broken up or whatever. a group of us at work were talking about past relationships and i was like my last one was with ----- and cody's like omg..wait thats my cousin. i was like SHIT. he goes ""oh so she's bi?"" and i was like...ummm yeh...sorta...only more. and he was like ""are you sure, she's dated guys"" and i was like... ""yeeeeh she's pretty sure."" but then i felt really really fuckin retarded and felt like an ass hole cause i OUTED HER!!! ahhhhh!!!! so i made cody promise that he wouldnt say anything...and i think i can trust him. hopefully. 

aight...that was my sorta not quite rant for the day. peace. i'm out."

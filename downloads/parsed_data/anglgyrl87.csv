"event","Ok well I talked to Hannah a little today about all this with Fuzz.  She says that its not cool that Im all into Fuzz, cause when I was into Josh she didnt flirt with him when he flirted with her casue she knew that I liked him and she thinks its kinda wrong that I flirt with Fuzz when I know she likes him.  Or at least that is what I got from what she was saying.  But I cant help it.  I flirt with everyone.  Im just a big flirt. And Im such a flirt around Luke's friends.  Like all of them.  I know sometimes it can be wrong but I cant help it.  And I am kinda into Fuzz. I got to talk to him today on the phone :) Its was nice....he can be so sweet.  Like he is really nice to talk to and he nice to me hes not an ass.  I dont know, like I said I dont think I would be all serious with him or anything.  But I dont know.  I think I said this before.....but Im just gonna go with the flow what happens happens and that is that.  So yea but anyways with everything else....not to much is going on with me.  Im kinda lonely right now.  I dont have that many people to talk to.  Like I have Hannah and I love her....but sometimes its nice to have more then one person to talk to.  And sure I have my friends in school...but it seems that they really dont care about some of the stiff I have to say.  Like Kristina and Kirstine care but like when I talk to Amber and Nikki its weird.  I cant explain it. Now Im not talking shit or anything.....its jsut kinda weird talkin to them but whatever I like talking to them.  And I will always be here for them if they need me :)  But yea the weather sucks ass.  Like I cant stand any more rain.  It has been raining all week.  I just want a warm sunny day for once.  PLEASE!!!!!  Is that to much to ask for.  But yea that is about all that is going on with me.

"event","Ok well.....I was just texting Fuzz for like 3 hours (again).  But like we were just talking about nothing really...then like I asked him what he was doing and he said that he was sitting at Luke's being cold.  He said that he was curled up in a ball by Luke's little heater.  I said o Im sorry....then he says well its ok cause I get to talk to you.  Awwww....how sweet  then I asked him when he was going to move in with Luke.  He said June sometime.  Then he asked me if I was gonna come see him...I said well I asked Luke if I could come stay with him for a little this summer and he said he didnt know.  Then he was all well I dont think he will mind.  I said well then yep Im gonna come see ya.  OMG.....I really dont know what is going on.  Like Hannah is into Fuzz alot.....and I dont want to be a bitch and be like well now Im into him and shit.  Cause Hannah is like my sis and I dont want to hurt her.  But like I dont know I think that I'm kinda getting into him.  But like there is the whole thing of him being like 26.  WOW that is kinda old.  But like I dont even know........Who knows I think Im just gonna go with the flow ya know but yea that is about all that is new.  But other then that the weather sucks ass.  Its all rainy and icky......everything is glommy.  Its making every one sad...and thats not cool.  But I'm gonna go now cause I have some homework to do.

"event","Well my weekend was more eventfull then any weekend that I have had in a while but it was a good eventfull.  Well Thursday night I went to Kristina's house with Kirstine and Shawn was there and then at like 6:00 we went bowling.  We saw Amber there and Ashley and Autum.  It was fun.....I was texting Fuzz for a while so that was FUN.  Then we went back to Kristina's house and went to bed.  Kristina and Shawn fell asleep and Kristine and I talked for like and hour or two.  Then we went to go to bed....but I didnt sleep for like 3 or 4 hours casue Kristina's lil brother kept trying to talk to me but I would not answer him.  Like he was really freeking me out.  It was kinda scary.  Then my mom came to get me at like 3:00 and she took me to Hannah's house.  When I got there Hannah, Me and her Mom went into town.  When we got back her mom asked her steepdad if he wanted to go to Banaza?  He said yea so I went to Banaza with them.  That was fun.  Then we went to go some movies.  So we got back to her house and we watched ""Thirteen"" and ""Jeepers Creepers 2"".  ""Thirteen"" was a really good movie.  Then we went to bed and when we woke up we ate and watched a little bit of ""Up Town Girls"" then she got in the shower and I got in the shower and we went to Luke's house.  When we got there Luke was not there.  Fuzz and his son were.  Man I have no freeking clue what is going on with Fuzz.   Like I have been texting him a lot.......and like all day yesterday just little things that were happening...I dont know.  Like the way we would look at each other and little things he would say to me.  I dont know its kinda crazy.  Like I would never go out with him or anything but I would mess around with him.  But yea....and with Josh I dont really even want to call him anymore.  Cause like why would I want to call someone who hung up on me what is the point of that.  Ya know what I mean.  But I dont know....then Saturday night Hannah and I went to her house to eat and then we went back to Luke's.  When we got there Fuzz was still there.  Like after 5 mins I took him and his son home.  I GOT TO DRIVE :)  But then I went back to Lukes and stayed there with Hannah.  Then we watched ""School of Rock"".  It was pretty good.  Then we wnent to sleep.  Today Luke went to Jasons grave cause it is his birthday today.  He went with Ben and Cnady.  Then after that he came up to Granny's and we ate up there.  Then Mom Gabby me and Curt came home.  I went to bed till like 8:30 and now I am on here.  But yea that was my weekend. Not very exciting but hey."

Mom is still talking to Brian and shit and she told me the other day that she was gonna start to look at jobs out there.  So that is a good sign :)  But like I have a pretty good day I found out that my grades are getting a little better.  So that is kinda cool.  But other then that not much happened today."

(if ya dont know me then you would have no clue what im talkin about) But he said that I have to get them off cause they could have cancer.  And like he is gonna cut my skin and then fold the skin over and stitch it (I'm guessing).  And he is doing all of this while I'm AWAKE!!!!!!!!! What the hell is up with that.  I really think that he needs to put me to sleep.  I have no clue when all this is gonna happen but I'm so scared :'( Like when he told me that he wasnt gonna but me to sleep I started crying.  Im so scared its not even funny.  But yea I have no clue what is going on with cali.  Like Luke wants to go back and I want to go back more then anything in the world, but Gabby doesnt really want to go and I think mom wants to go.  And my grades here sucks ass and when I was out there they were fine.  And Im not doing anything different then I was out there so I dont understand.  But whatever......I get to talk to Josh tonight.  Well if he's home. Last time I talked to him he said that he might be going to DC for Spring Break and I wanna find out if he is so that I why Im calling him.  Well and just the fact that I want to talk to him.  OMG it makes me so happy that I'm gonna get to talk to him :) But yea that is about all that is new with me.  This weekend kinda sucked ass.  I sat on my ass the whole weekend.  Like I had fun at Lukes and everything it was just a lil boring.  But yea that is about it.

And I really dont have that here.  Yea I have friends here but like I cant hang out with them cause I have no way to get anywhere. And I cant go do anything cause I have no money.  Everyone just goes to partys around here.  Sure people out there go to partys but since I dont drink or anything we would always find something that we all had fun doing.  Even if we went out walking, not really knowing where we were going.  Here I cant do that.  All anyone ever does here is go to partys :( so that leaves me here by myself.

I was so happy....so I went back to bed.  It took me a while to get back to sleep but I did.  I didnt want to even come to school today so it jsut made it better that we had a delay.  OMG this weekend is gonna be so boring...I want to go to Luke's house but I really dont think that is goona happen cause he has to DJ (I think).  And there is no where for me to sleep..yet.  I wanna go so bad though cause I really dont want to just sit at my house.  There is not gonna be a damn thing for me to do at my house. Everyone wants to go to cali with me this summer. Its crazy.....but it would be so much fun if I went with alot of people.  Like I know Ashley wants to go and Nikki just told me today that she wants to go, and Hannah wants to go.  But like that is not gonna work casue Ashley and Nikki dont really get alone. But hey if they both still wanna come its cool with me.  I think we should just get like 2 cars and drive out there.  We would have to get money though. I dont think that would be to hard but hey.  I have to start saving my money.  I want to get enough to go to Redondo's prom next year.  So I have to save enough to get the plane ticket and a dress and to get my nails done and my hair.  That alot of money, but I think I can do it.  Like I really want to go and I would get to go to prom with Tara and Jakcie and everyone.....so hey.  i dont even know if I want to go to prom here.  Like I wanna go really bad. But I want a date and like I have no idea who I could go with.  Hummmmmmmm....there is always Ben.  But Im not gonna ask him....I dont ask guys to dances.  And its prom the guy has to ask the girl.  Thats the way it work.  So I guess we will see.  I will end up going even if I dont have a date watch.  But Im not gonna go if none of my firends go.  But Im sure they will.  Cause it would be fun.  I just want to go cause I wanna get a pretty dress and get my nails done and girl stuff. God I hate study halls they are so boring.  Like I never have anything to do.  If some of my firends were in here it would be different.  But no they all have some class.  But Im gonna go cause class is almost over.

But yea other then that nothing really happened today.  I was gonna go to my chior concert but that didnt happen cause the roads were to bad.  My moms car is from cali and it sucks driving in the snow so she did not want to drive anywhere.  So I didnt get to go to that.  And I didnt get to talk to Tara to see if Josh has said anything back about the letter that I wrote him.  God it is driving me crazy.  I wanna know what he is gonna say.  Even if it is bad I still wanna know like really really bad.  I really should stop liking him.  It kinda bugs me that I still love him.  But hey I will just have to live with it, till I find someone new to love.  That really does not seem to be happening though. I even tried to like other people and they just decided to be assholes.  God.....Im tellin ya.  I have such bad luck when it comes to guys.  I cant seem to make it work.  I hate it but whatever.

I think Im kinda leaning towards cali right now cause no one here is giving me any reason to stay.  Like sure I have friends here but I dont know it is just not the same as it was.  the people here do not understand what is going on with me at all.  Well Ashley understands but no one else really does.  And I cant do anything here cause I live in the middle of nowhere and no one likes to drive out there and my mom doesnt like to drive anywhere.  Its really gay.....I hate living out there.  I cant even walk anywhere.  Well I could walk but I would not get anywhere.  I miss the city so much.  Well not really the city just being able to walk out the front door and go somewhere. I just wish that things could go right for once in my life.  Like I want the life back that I had in cali.  Where I saw my boyfriend everyday (out of school) and I had friends at my house all the time.  And if we were not at my house we were somewhere else.  But I was always with someone.  I was not alone all the time.  Now Im always alone......I dont get to see my boyfriend and I dont get to chill with my firends.  God I hate it.  Now sure you might read this and say o she needs to stop pitying her self(like my friend hannah).  Well if you want to look at it that way then dont read it.  And if I happen to be talking to you and all this starts to come out dont listen.  Cause Im not trying to sound like Im pitying myself Im just trying to get all this shit out.  So its not all bottled up inside anymore.  I can remember when Hannah said that to me...I kinda hurt me cause that is what a friend is for to listen when you need to talk or vent, and that is all that im doing.  But yea that is about all that I'm thinking about right now so....."

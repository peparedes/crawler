I had it on friday but the my boss forgot to sign the bottom of it so i couldn't cash it. went back today he was there so got it signed and went an cashed it. Spent most of the day with my mom only cus she wouldnt let me stay home Damn parents. After all of that we went shopping for some school stuff, pens and notebooks stuff like that.
After that i came home went on the computer for a lil and my dad came home so we went to my cousins new house. This house is cool,i should say the backyard is cool.

It has cable, power, and phone line in it u could live in there. theres also a little chipping green in the back for golf. good thing i didnt have any money to bet cause i would of lost it against my cousin. stayed there for a couple of hours then went home and thats where im at now. see everybody tomorrow

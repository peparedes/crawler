"event","damn!!! funkin chaois if you ask me! the WHOLE LOT OF IT! well hmm... alright i will tell this story one more time but after this i am done! i have told at least 100 people minimum. but yea....

sunday night around 4ish my mom met my aunt to pick me up to come home and on the way of course me and my mom were arguing. she was mad because i gave my aunt a hug and kiss goodbye and told her i loved her and then i turned around and told my mom that i hate her. so yea then things started getting ugly. she told me to pull over and i was doing about 65-70 down the road (cops dont know that though) but yea she started going physco.. she opened her door threatening to jump out, turned on an off the windsheild wipers, tried putting the car in park, tried putting her foot on the break peddle then she starting turning the wheel back and forth. we almost it a fuckin car! it was crazy. but yea i finally pulled the car over and called devin cuz i was crying hard. she called me back when i got home and told me i needed to call the cops so i did. i told ginger that they should be on there way and when they came i explained to them what had happend and that my mom was at bingo. ginger added to my story everything else thats been going on including the nasty house and how the dogs arn't registered and dont have shots. mmhmm so yea then they arressted my mom that night and i had to stay at kts house with maggie and her family. it was so awkward cuz me and kt were fighting at the time. but yea the next day i find out that the goes to court the 26th and that i have a ppo agaisnt her. well then yesterday the child pertective services came and talked to me and said the ppo and charges have been released because theres not enough proof. so yea then today i came home and it was really weird. so thats what happend with all the shit. i still have to talk to my mom tonight. but yea back to my chaotic school life/randy life lol.

i guess i have a D in engligh and an A- in history. it sucks but i dont really care at this point. at tba i met a really hott kid. hes in the classroom next to me and when i was walking with kt and erica he started talking to them then he said that he tries waving to my through the door in classes but i never seen him before. hes a BABE! I TELL YOU WHAT! LOL his name is funny though.. its art. (hello my names art) lol i just cant get enough but yea its fuckin smokin hott! i shouldnt be saying that cuz of randy but omg he said the cutest thing to me the other day. actually last night. we were on the phone and he was saying how much he loved snowboarding and he was like ya.. hopefully as time goes on i'll feel the same about about u.. so what do you think? and i was like ""its happening quickly"" or somthin like that i forgot but yea and hes like "" yea i know. i love that i already feel this way about you and its just the beginining of our relationship."" and omg it was soo cute. he calls me beautiful and hun and babe. i wanna call him thinkg back but im still a lil shy and stuff. AND OMG I JUST FOUND OUT THAT COURTNEY CHAPMAN AND TREVOR HUDSON ARE DATING! HOW FUCKIN WEIRD IS THAT?!?!?! i dunno lol its insane. but yea thats pretty much the low down on my life at this point. i left out a couple things but i cant think at the moment. randy just called me back and now im waiting patiently for him to get outta the shower i can see him. i havnt been able to see him for the past couple days cuz im been having to stay at maggies. the other night i went for a ""walk"" and called him and seen him for like 15 min. we just made out in the back of damians car the whole time... it was nice. but yea then last night kt got pissed at me ONCE AGAIN over stupid shit. she thinks all i care about is myself and i dont think about anyones feelings and i scew everthing up but yea thats besides the point. yea she was yelilng for me to get off the phone with my crackhead boyfriend. that pissed me off so bad. but yea then i started crying and called my mom. i got off the phone with ginger and cried for like a half hour longer. then kt went downstairs. when she got back she handed me a ciggarette. we smoked and then we talked a lil bit after we calmed down. it was funny cuz shes like ""when i smoke a ciggarette i have to poop cuz it relaxes me"" lol i dunno i busted out laughing. then we went downstairs and i guzzled a couple cap fulls of nyquil. then we took a coupld swigs of alcohol in the pantry. when we went back upstairs i split all my pills i had on me with her... including my diet pills lol. we each had 4 of those. i dunno we were pretty fucked up then passed out."

today i woke up at noon at randys and he took me home. thats where i took a shower, got dressed, and then went tanning. when i got home i talked on the phone for a while and went to the market to get food for school lunches. then i came home and fell asleep and had crazy dreamds. randy picked me up soon after that.. aroudn 8ish. then i smoke a duby with him nick and damo. i havnt been stoned in a while. but oh yeah! and the cold sore from hell, ever since ive been kissing randy i havt a whole bunch of cold sores starting on my lip. if they get bad enough theres no way in hell im going to school or to randys! its weird though because I HAVE NEVER HAD A COLD SORE IN MY LIFE!!!! NO FUCKIN JOK! its crazy... its its worth it. ever since weve been dating weve been so close.. always cudding and holding hands and kisssing. today we made out in front of nick and last night we did shit when damo was passesd out on the footon. i guess he pissed it again lol. that kid always pisses when he gets drunk.tba is goin pretty good. i already took my first test on ch3.. i got 3 wrong outta 25. it was 88% which isnt bad... i like that class. but yea i think im gonna crash or read a book or something. i'll update soon. chow!"

"event","dude so much to write about.. wow i can even think about this without being overwelmed. first of all on sept. 2nd i got drunk with jenny hartley, billy, and an arab lookin kid named nick. that night was CRAZY! i got shit faced, went to a bar, danced, made out with jenny, went to deans for a min. made out with nick. then passed out. that pretty much sums up the night! but thats not the importan issue right now. the important issue is that


  RANDY ASK ME OUT!!!

yesterday... well actually it started at like 2 in the morning on the 5th and 
he said: hey just wanted to say sweet dreams and goonight
i said:  k u too. so what do you think about us?
he said: i think i like you a lot. how bout u?
i said:  i agree
he said: so the next ? is do u want be with me
i said: do you want me to

  then he fell asleep and texted me the next morning while i was tanning ""yea for a while now"" i didnt know what he was talking about but yea then after tanning i hung out with him all day. then when damian went into the store he just started talking about it then we pretty much agreed that we wanted to try it out. so yea ive been dating this kid for a whole day so far. his sister jenny invited me for a car ride so she could explain a few things bout randy and how i should keep an eye on nicole and shit like that. it pisses me off. if she goes near him you dont understand how mad i would get. i fuckin love that kid to death and she just wants to be a fuckin slut and thats not right!

 well today was the first day of school... i thought i would just be seeing who was in my classes and stuff but we went to tba instead. im in accounting/office technology. someone told me it was the hardest class at tba which really sucks. i got my picture taken there today. i havnt seen it yet. hopefully i dont have a dorky smile or something. but yea mr. buron doest teach that class cuz he got a promotion or something which sucks cuz i liked that teacher a lot. he came in and visited for a while though. i only had to do half the work cuz when i visited last year i did some of the stuff they did today. my average wpm was 96 so i was pretty happy. i cant believe courtney chapman is in my class. it fuckin sucks but oh well... nothin i can do bout it. god! i cant stop thinkin bout him..."

  well me and kt were bein bored waiting for jrod cuz he said he was going to bring us a bag.. well he didnt and we couldnt get ahold of him so we were pissed... later on jenny hartley calls me! it was crazy cuz i havnt talked to her in a while.. her and billy are dating now. thats crazy too. i havnt seen that guy in forever. well they pick us up to drive out to billy so he can grab his workshirt or something then we picked up some kid named nick.. he looked mexican or something. but anyways we went out onto a 2 track and smoke a joint and me, kt, and jenny downed 2 40's in like a 1/2 hour. it was nuts! i was fucked up! no joke! but yea then the took us home. i had to walk kt home and when we got about half way kt called jason and he picked us up and took us home. then after that i guess chris(jennys x) called jone saying that we were drinking and stuff.. (i still dont know what happend with that) so yea.. then            i  really wanted to see dan goin so i was waiting to go to the party. well jason picks me up while im still drunk and takes me to curts!! well at that point i sobered up quick cuz jaline and randi were there. i just sat there for about an hour and said nothing to no one. i felt so unwelcome especially when jason had to go to glens and i couldnt go!! but yea then we went to the bonfire and and dan couldnt even go. i found out jaline kinda likes him!! which PISSES ME OFF MAJORLY! but then i just had them take me home. 

  today i went to t.c with my grandma to go school clothes shopping. she spent around 300 and last time around 200 so i spent about 500 on school clothes this year.. i still gotta get underwear and bras and sandals but yea i had fun today. now im debating on whether to go to jennys again or hang out with randy. i doubt randy wont even call me back anyways so i will prolly go with jenny..."

"event","dude last night was pretty rockin!! well okay kt and i wanted to do something fun since it was supose to be her last night where she could do something so we figured out that we wanted to by a bag of weed. the problem was that i didnt know who to call. i called jrod.. no answer... alyse... no answer. i was so desperate i called steven kendal! OMG BIG MISTAKE. he answered and was like ""what do you want"" he told me he didnt have any weed but i know he was lieing. anyways, after that i called matt n to see if he knew dave e.'s number cuz i knew he would have some. i got ahold of him and he said to wait til 10:00 so matt came over and waited with me and kt... finallly he got home and he said he couldnt get any. he was as pissed as me. well there was a party at musser rd goin on that matt invited me and kt to but we didnt want to go cuz we thought we were going to get the shit beat outta us. so we just went back to my house. then i got a call from randy saying he wanted to hang out.. well when i called him back he said lets just hang out tomorrow. so me and kt were extremly bored!! jrod called me really late and was like well theres a party on musser rd.. do you wanna go? i can prolly get weed he says. well i wanted to go just so he could get weed so me and kt got ready and met him and dewey at hot tips. OMG WHEN I SEEN JROD(CUZ I NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE) MY JAW DROPPED! HE WAS SO FUCKIN UGLY! LOL YUCKY...but yea we got in the car and i called jason for directions and told him he HAD to go down there cuz i was afraid someone was going to beat my ass. it turned out jaline and randi never came (thank god) but star and her sister were there. they were cool though.. very nice. other people that were there were dave p, dave e. dan g (hotty), ryan l, jason m, justin p, chris d, horhay, jrod, dewey, brandon b, brandon n, matt n, and curt and some other people but while we were there jason got a wine cooler from dan for me. then i was talking to dan thanking him for it and he was like ""yea no problem but im saving my alcohol for tomorrow"" then he INVITED ME TO HIS PARTY! IM SO EXITED! but yea he talked to me about it a couple times that night making sure i had a ride and stuff. i use to like that kid so much. but yea then jason drove us to k-town so kt could get cigarettes then he took us home. 

today i got into a huge fight with my mom about letting me move to mount pleasant with kt. she said no and stuff and my grandma came over and made me clean my room before we talked.. well i guess im gonna go to scohol in mancy for a while to see if i like tba and if not then im enrolling in p-town. i already talked to some of my friends there and they cant wait for me to come. so yea now im trying to decide on whether i should hang out with randy tonight or go to dans. randy textmessaged me and told me he wanted to see me today but he hasnt called telling me when. so i think im just gonna go to the party. jason told me that dan asked jaline out.. thats crazy. he asks out fat chicks, makes out with brook m (when drunk) and yet doesnt even notice me. hes like 21 though but still...HOTTIE HOT!"

"event","well 2 days ago i had a lot of fun. i wrote it all down once but lost it so its prolly not as good as before but i'll try.

 last sunday i was hanging out with kt and we had to go get her phone at a friends house. we were walking home past nick youngs house at he was outside so we stopped and talked to him for while. after that we walked home the normal way and nick and randy were driving by.. they stopped and asked if we wanted to get drunk! nick gave kt a cigarette too. but yea then we went up to get changed and stuff. we went up there around 10ish and started drinking. it was damian, nick, randy, kt, jenny, josh, and lil josh. i was so shitface. i only had 2 drinks but they were mixed 75% alcohol and 25% pop. damian was cracking us up while we were sitting in the garage. well evetually someone suggested that we had a bon fire so we got in the truck and josh got in the tractor thingy and he built a pit in the middle of the dirtbike trail. i dont remember the first time but randy held me and kissed me the whole night. i was on cloud 9!!! i was so happy but drunk at the same time. but yea we had a fire and i admited to them that i smoke cigarettes. no one could beleive it lol. then randy gave me a back masage and shit. later on damian was giving me shit about looking like a monkey and that randy looked like one too. i started pinching him and eventually i burnt off his eyebrow lol because the whole night i was infactuated with my ""flick your bic"" lighter. anyways after we were sick of bein aroudn the fire we went inside where randy and damian and nick decided to make breakfast. i helped a little but burnt my hand turning the bacon with my fingers. after that randy had to take a shower and jenny and josh went to bedso it was just me kt and damian. well me and damian were being mean to eachother all night and he was goin on about how he was going to drown himself and he got in randys parents bathtub so i turned on the water. IT WAS SO FUNNY! but yea then randy got out and i layed with him and we kissed. we havnt made out yet. its weird but yea that was that night. we woke up early cuz he had to go to work at 7 so then damian took us home and we went to the new coffee place and ate breakfast at the hole in the wall. we never went back to sleep..

  then last night me and kt hung out with randy for only 2 hours. it was pretty boring because it was randy, nick, sam, jenny, josh, and whitney. some of them were drinking beer.. randy and sam were higher than a mothafucka so they were hilarous i wasnt having much fun cuz i was sober then the most funnyest thing happend. jenny and whitney were talking about how nick looked like a bobble head because of all the crack he does and that his nose weighs him down and omg im cracking up as we speak when i think about it. but yea then we had to go hoem early cuz they had to work. on the way to the truck randy put his arm around me and gave me a kiss goodbye. it was a quick wimpy kiss. i was sorta mad but yea... he said he would call me tomorrow but he never did

so yea that brings me to today. i didnt absoultly nothing. i took a shower, cleaned my room. then went to the basketball game. it was so weird beign there cuz no one talked to me and bacon was giving me dirty looks. i think its because she seen me sleeping with randy the other night but yea. then kt came over to get her stuff and left when my mom came home. its 10:35 and still no call from randy. i wanna call him but i know im not. i tried calling jason cuz he was at the game but he didnt answer. so yea now im just listening to music. bored to death and depressed cuz im on my period and everything is life reckoning. (wow i wrote a lot tonight)

well the whole school thing and my mom thing is complicated. i dont have any friends here and it sucks. i kinda wanna go to petoskey but i dont know. and im soo sick of my mom. shes not even a parent. she goes to work everyday and expects me to clean the downstair (which isnt even my mess) then she gets home and gets all mad at me. she cant even afford to get to work so my cell phone is shut off and im so sick of not being able to get things when i need them. im turning white cuz i havnt tanned in weeks and tammy doesnt answer the phone when i call. i think its because of my mom or something. but yea..."

(it was pointless that she came over lol) just shows how stuid we are. anyways, we stopped at the gas station on the way to get something to drink. nick walked in (randys friend) and started talking to me asking what i was doing today and shit.. well i said nothing and kt got mad so i walked her most of the way home and then walked home myself. i was so exited but i found out my mom didnt pay my cell phone bill that day so nick just said he would be at my house in an hour give or take. so i went to my house.. shaved my legs got ready.. and waited FOREVER! while i was waiting i got online and talked to jason for a little bit. (im for real SO over him) yuck! haha but yea finally nick arrived when my mom pulled in and he met my mom and stuff.. then when we were on our way to randys v.c pulled us over... NICK DIDNT HAVE HIS HEAD LIGHTS ON! WHAT A MORON. well we were both freaking out because he had an O. of snow and an O. of green. so we were both pretty worried. he didnt even have his registration for his truck. well luckily v.c let him go and we safly got to randys house. we we arrived gerald(havnt seen that kid in FOREVER) chris d, pat, and sam were there. it didnt seem like randy really wanted me there but yea.. all we did til 7 in the morning was smoke some chochane.. randy tried to get me to snort a line but i was to scared...i was really fucked up. well around 7 i was getting pretty tired so i told randy we shoudl go lay down. he got in the shower and i fell asleep for like an hour. when i woke up he came in and fell asleep and i fell back asleep. then the most amazing thing happend.. he attempted to make a move! he put his arm around me and started rubbing my back. I WAS SOO HAPPY! but then he just stopped and rolled over and that was it. i was so confused. well when we woke up we found out that bacon and courtney came there to wake him up and barely shit there pants when they seen me sleeping next to him LOL but im glad there pissed off. i think randy and bacon have a thing or somethign cuz he metioned later that morning ""well nicole just fucked brandon last week"" and jenny butted in and was saying shes always bringing younger guys home from outta state or something.. but i dunno i just found it a little weird. god i like this kid soo much! but yea he's sister dropped me off at home today.. hes supose to call me when he wakes up to hang out again but i doubt it.. so now i just got outta the shower and i think im gonna paint my nails or something.."

 today we woke up to the smell of pancakes that my grandma prepaired for us. after we gobbled them up we went to petoskey and went to dunhams to get a volleyball for when we went to the beach again. so while we were there we got that and then i gor an awesome pair of ti-dye shorts. i love them haha. then we went to fashon bug ( didnt see anything there) so then we went to gliks and i got the coolest purse ever!! i would show it to you but i dont feel like looking for batteries for my camera. sorry but yea.. then we went to walloon for a little bit then i came home and did some laudry and now im talking to people on the internet and eating this beeferoni type stuff... not that good but hey, its food so i'll eat it. 

 tomorrow i guess im taking my brother home with my grandma and katie and then im going school clothes shopping. i dont know how its gonna go but i will see tomorrow i guess...

  i almost forgot to mention that chelsey buckweat sent me and email today saying sorry and that she doesnt have a problem with me it was really weird. i think the only explanation is that her and courtney are no longer friends or something but i dunno. it was crazy. jason told me that nick has a new girlfriend so i dunno whats up with that but i want to find out. he came to my house yesterday my mom said but i was at my grandmas. oh yea.. i really need a shower"

"event","Sorry i didnt write yesterday. i totally forgot and lost track of time. well about an hour after i got home yesterday i was already bored out of my mind and i was really hot and cranky. then of course i argued with my mom for ever... 

last night i had really bad growing pains at about 2 in the morning and i went downstairs and cried to my mom. we fought some more but then she got over it and felt sorry for me and rubbed my leg and we had a really intense talk. it was weird. i was really emotional last night. i dont know why though. probably because i havnt cried in a long time and i was tired and all that other good stuff. 

omg i had the weirdest dream last night. it was crazy. well okay.. it started when i was at pauls house with randy and his friends i think and it was in mancelona.... we were all hanging out but i wanted to go home because there were these people that are dressed in black uniforms who go around the town and when they find people.. they kill them. ( dont ask me why) lol so i was really scared and wanted to go home but randy said we would be fine and that they have been doing that for about a month and non of them never came to pauls house. so then we were sitting in a car parked outside of the house. it was me, randy, and 2 of randys friends. and all of a sudden the people in black uniforms showed up. randy explained to me that it was to late to hide or duck in the back seat because they have a device that will tell how many people are in the car. ( isnt this dream crazy so far? i swear im not making it up) so they see us and take us inside and just hold us captive for a while or something like that.. then i remember there was a basketball court inside and everyone wanted to play or something but anyways me and randy waited there for a while. then we started holding hands and kissed for a lil bit. then eventually we escaped and ran as fast as we coudld to this one house... i think it was the hed cheaf of those one weird black suited people. randy told me not to worry.. that we were just going to peak inside. but then the black suited guy seen us and grabbed randy so i ran away. i ran sooo fast it was so scary. i really didnt want to die. i figured i had to try to get to my house some how but it was weird because i was thinking about my old house in boyne. so i started running and then i seen my mom walking on one side of a fense on the road and i see caleb on the other side. i walked under the bleachers next to the gate where caleb was because  seen those bad guys driving on the road. so i yelled at caleb to take me home. he said his car was at eh beach. i dont even wanna try to explain where it was. so we finally got there and i was hiding behing a phone booth. then caleb totally igorned me and i seen travis p and asked him for a ride. he was hanging out with some girls so of course he said no. so i sneeked over to calebs car thinking i would just hide in there til hes ready to go but the black suited guys seen me go in so i instantly junped back out and started running. i got to a cliff and there was a lake at the bottom. it was a really long way down but i jumped and started swimming downwards. the bad guys followed me but the weird thing was, is that they couldnt go down as far as me and they couldnt hold there breath for as long. then i remembered that someone gave me this thing where i can breath underwater so i started swimming. then i met this girl who gave me this remote.. i dunno the rest doesnt really make sense but i will say it anyways. i guess now i could jump to any picture.. like a painting on the wall and then the cops would never find me so thats what i did. i remember i was in a picture where i was a little girl in a pink dress eating an icecream cone. then i was in a picture of an office and the person that gave me the remote was there and i asked her if that remeote could be a phone if i plugged it into an outlet or something in the offfice. so we did and i called randy... dont ask me how. i talked to him for a little bit but i dont remember what about. i guess eventually i got into a painting in my dads tool van and was safe. when we arrived home it was weird because it was where my old house was but it was a grey 2 story house and then we decided we wanted to go camping in the back yard. 
 
that i think was the crazyest dream i ever had. i swear im not making it up! i think its because i was so depressed last night. ohh and i think it was mainly about randy because we made plans the night before and he never called me back."

"event","overall, today was pretty fun. i slept in til late and then when lisa and my dad arrived home we went out to dinner at red hot and blue. my dad wore coyboy boots. it was the funniest thing i ever seen. i could never picture my dad in coyboy boots like. it was a riot! i wanted to point it out to him so bad but i didnt feel like being a mean person so i kept it to myself. so after that we drove around a little bit and then stopped and got icecream. i havnt had superman icecream in as long as i can remember. when i got back lisa painted my nails. i got a french manicure. they turned out really pretty. i checked my voicmails today and randy left me another message! hes famous saying is ""hey beautiful"" lol i love it when he says that. but yea i was happy. i dont know if im going to call him when i get back or go to boyne. i guess it depends on what jen has to do. if she has to go downstate or not. i think im going to stay up for a while because im not tired at all and its going to be a long ride tomorrow. i have to leave by 9 to meet my mom at 11. i havnt even packed yet."

"event","today was probably the funnest day since ive been downstate. lisa finally took us to the oaklin water park. i pretty much just layed in the sun. i cant even descibe how nice it felt. i havnt been laying out in the real sun for as long as i can remember. it was nice. it wasnt a very big waterpark. it consists of a wave pool, 3 water slides, a lazy river, and a lil kids place. my favorite was one of the water slides. the purple one. it went so fast. i love it. we mostly were in the wave pool though or laying out. this place was nice because they let people bring a cooler so you dont have to buy all that expensive junk. i ended up getting dipping dots there. i havnt had that in so long. it was yummy! lol then after being at the water park for about 6 hours we went to a chinese food place and ate and on the way out a guy polled aside lisa and said "" you better keep a shotgun to keep the guys away from your daughter"" it was weird because my face was really red and burnt and my eyes were bloodshot and i had beachbum hair. but it was still a really nice comment. i am so tired and my face really hurts. i havnt been sun burned in a long long time. well except for sometimes when i go tanning in a bed but the redness goes down in just a couple hours. tonight lisa is going to paint my nails! well yup thats pretty much my day. i was supose to go home today but we were at the waterpark for too long and my mom works til 9 every night so i dont know what im going to do or how im getting home. all i know is that i wanna leave soon. im starting to miss everyone. i especially want to get back so i can go to boyne"

"event","well today was pretty ordinary.. calm nothing exiting or anything. well when we went to the market 2 boys yeld out that they want my number but i was to imbarressed because lisa was with me that i didnt look. but i was happy because i looked like shit. i didnt have any makeup on and my hair was pulled back and my bra straps were showing. i looked horrid. 
  
lol but anyways jason is talking to me like nothing ever happend. its weird because i never even told him that i was done being mad at him but whatever. i guess its better to have a couple friends in mancy then none. 
  
i forgot to tell you about when i talked to kelly austin on the internet. he told me that he seen me on the forth and to get ahold of him when i come to boyne again. i was pretty happy. i remember in 3rd grade me and him use to be the biggest class clowns. we would always cheat on tests and help eachother out. i remember in kinigarden i had a crush on him lol its crazy.
  
but yea i talked to nick today too alot on the internet. i think he wants to try to hook up but i dont know. 
  
i wish me and randy could try to be an item and see how it goes. thats pretty much up to date. 
  
i guess lisa is taking us to the water park tomorrow so it should be a fun day. 
  
when i get home im seriously going on a diet. im always thinking about my weight now. its weird."

You really don't like the taste of alcohol - just its effect on you.
So, you're proud to get drunk on fruity, girly drinks.

School got out not to long ago so i will update you on my summer. It pretty much sucks so far. Well hmm where do i begin? I started of to like a boy named jason and eventually dated him for about a week. But durring that time period i cheated on him few times with a guy named chris c. There was a bon fire at dales house and it was just dale, chris, alyse, and i. Alyse and dale had sex and me and chris did everything but sex. He promised me that no one would know because we did stuff like that all the time when he was dating someone but anyways i guess the word got out that we had ""sex"" (which wasnt true) (i think alyse told people).. of course i lied to jason saying it wasnt true because i couldnt go through all the hardache of all his friends and him hating me. so i never told him. and while i was dating him i hung out with steven k for a while but all of a sudden he stopped talking to me. i dont know if its because he thinks im dating jason and just found out or what but ive been calling him for like a week. anyways, i broke up with jason because he started acting really weird and physco. ever since then i have just been chillin at home and hanging out with some friends. but i think the last three days were the best days of my summer. I hung out with randy v and on june 30th we rolled all night. then on the first of july i went all the way downstate with him and his friends nick and billy and i tried crack for the first time. it was the awesomest feeling ever. i dont regret it at all. it was a fun night. anyways, thats pretty much all i remember of this summer so far. tomorrow well actually today is the 4th of july and i have no clue what im going to do. i think alyse is going to come over and we are going to boyne to watch fireworks but im not for sure yet. ohh and i forgot to mention that i hung out with jason and his friends tonight. we played basketball at like 11 p.m tonight. it was fun but im for sure over that weirdo... lol. well i tihnk thats all im going to write tonight because im beat and about to go to bed."

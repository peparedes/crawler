"event","So last night in bed I was thinking about how excited I was to go rafting today.. and I was like wait there's going to be rapids.. yeah dumb aimee moment.. Anyway so I'm like freaking out cus I havent been rafting in forever and I was so scared and terrified.. and then Nick goes oh theres fish in this river.. as if that helped.... apart from the fact that my whole raft wanted to throw me into the water it was a great day! I had alot of fun!! THe first part of the trip I was terrified.. then we went over one rapid and I love it! Actually half the time I was like oh we went over a rapid? Nick and I are so dumb sometimes.. we'd all be talking adn then a rapid would come up and one of us (honestly seriously) would be like oh I forgot about the rapids..  but it was SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO much fun! I can't wait till next year. ALthough I found out that you can get burned even when its not sunny! We went to these natural water slides and we had to walk on the sand to get there.. I didnt know that so I didnt wear my shoes.. and Kevins' like oh you know that someone has gotten 2nd degree burns on their feet from walking on this sand with out shoes.. yeah that helped alot lol...  but it was so much fun I was terrified at first but then loved it. (that was my story for the day.. freaking out at first then loving it!) Oh man pretty much the funniest thing ever.. Nick and Miranda and Anna convinced me to go down some of these rapids called the Elevators with out our raft.. like we jump in the water and WHOOSH your going donw the rapids.. so we were all holding hands and I was doing great and the big rapids come and I'm freaking out and was like ""I hate you guys"" and Miranda thought I was saying I'm drowning let go of my hand... and that freaked me out even more.. but I mean how can you get those two mixed up? Even the way home was fun.. I talked with my friend Anna the whole time.. tis funny cus she's only going into 8th grade but I have so much fun with her and like we were trying to 'glare' and I couldnt glare with out laughing and so Anna's like think of blue carpet... which was suppose to help but just made me laugh harder.. now I can't glare w/o thinking of blue carpets and anna and laughing. 
All in all to day was SOO much fun! Oh man I can't wait till this weekend when we go camping.. I'm excited cus I organized.. well am trying to anyway, it so that all the high school and junior high students (I luv Anna so I included junior high) are going to (hopefully) get together one or both of the nights and have a prayer and worship time! Praying and worshipng are my two favorite things !  Besides fellowshiping! :) I DONT WANT SUMMER TO END! NOOO God's doing so much I dont want that to end either!!! :) :)"

"event","What if the armies of the Lord
Picked up and dusted off their swords
Vowed to set the captives free
And not let satan have one more

What if the church, for heaven's sake
Finally stepped up to the plate
Took a stand upon God's promise
And stormed hell's rusty gates

Chorus:
What if His people prayed
And all who bare His name
Would humbly seek His face
And Turn from their own way

And what would happen if we prayed
For those raised up to lead the way
Then maybe kids in school could pray
And unborn children see light of day

What if the life that we pursue
Came from a hunger for the truth
What if the family turned to Jesus
Stopped asking Oprah what to do

He said that they would hear
His promise has been made
He'll answer loud and clear
If only we would pray

If My people called by My name
If they'll humble themselves and pray
If My people called by My name
If they'll humble themselves and pray

P.S. think about the line in the song (also by Casting Crowns) If We are the Body... ""Jesus paid much to high a price for us to pick and choose who should come"" ~Something to think about."

"event","*If it's so easy for us to change, or rather want to change others why can't why so hard to change ourselves? What have we got to lose? If God is on our side.. who should we fear? If this is true than why are we (myself included) all still afraid to share the Gospel.... Which is what we were called to do see Matthew 28:19? 

Today in Big Church  Nick (the high school leader) preached. It was a really good serman.  He talked about rewards in heaven. And one thing he said really hit me..  he was talking about the parable in Matthew 25 (vs.14-30) about the master  who gives each of his servants coins... you can read it for your self. He talked about how being faithful to God ment making desciples, (relating it back to the master who gave a tendant five coins, and when he came back the tendant had ten coins, and the coins representing people the gospel's been shared to)  and I was thinking about how we tend to be  ( I know I am) like the tendant that when the master gives him his one coin to look after until he's back, the tendant burrys it so 'it will stay safe'. I think that's what most of us do, we take the gospel and good news of Jesus that we have heard, and treasure  it in our hearts keep it there but dont go out and share it, or show that we have it. Why are we so afraid to show Jesus in our lives? When the rewards are so great, and He is so great?  When nothing here can compare to anything we'll get in heaven?? 
Its something to think about."

It made me feel all good cus that's how I felt about her, and I was like really going to cry cus I felt bad for not getting to know any of them and then she said that about me. :( I will miss her alot! And David too! It was so much fun having an older brother. Last night we went ice skating... lets' just say that David and Ruthie and peter all did better than me and it was all of their first time lol! Well I'm going to go cry now...

This morning at church I was with the little kids all service.. I was going to go sit with the rest of our youth group after I led worship but I got sucked in cus I luv em'. (Sarah and Erin your sisters are adorable and I want them can I have them? :) ) THen after church Emily came over and we went to the park (our spot) and talked a bit.. then came home and had the most stressful hour of our lives trying to plan going to the movie w/ NIck and Andrew. Never try to get four poeple to agree on a movie... doesn't work lol. But we ended up seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.. I thought it was going to be really bad but it was AWESOME it was pretty much exactly like the book ( i only pointed out 2 things that were differetn twhich is  really amazing for me). It was alot of fun. We ended up sitting with teh Eldreges and Seth Miller cus they were there.. it was really random but fun.. Moo is so awesome I <3 her alot! And Amelia is ADORABLE! 
Then Andrew and Emily and I walked around the grave yard on 82nd (cus we were at Century 16)and it made me think...  I really like grave yards now for some reason.. I use to be scared to death (no punn intended) of them... 
After that Emily and I went to her house and watched one of my favorite movies that makes me think of my old girls from elmentry school (Tori, Care, Jenna and Sara and Nicole S and Carin) - Now and Then- ..it's such a cute movie! Anyway then I came home and talked to Em on the phone for about two hours... 
I do not want to go to math 2morrow.
But I'm looking forward to hanging w/ maddie if she still wants to that is.

It was pretty awesome. He didn't do his best , but I thought he did good. It was hard watching all the running events cus I wanted to be out there running. Funny... I use to hate running, now I can't stop thinking about it. Today was fun. My math class is actually not that bad. I don't talk in it at all believe it or not. I just dont find a point to talking. Anyway after math I was going to practice but ended up going to see Bewitched with Emiy. (now have theme song  stuck in head.) it was so cute. I liked it alot better than I thought I would. Then we went to the mall. It's kind of funny cus when we go to the mall we end up just walking around... and like not really shopping all that much. It's been pretty neat watching how God has been changing me and others that I've talked to from our Missions trip. Being able to apply things that I learned here has been really hard for me, but I've grown and changed alot from this trip. I am still proscessing through it all, there's just so much that happend for me that I don't really know where to begin so its hard to process it all. I know I've got along way to go, but so far I have come along way and I think the same goes for our entire youth group, I just really pray we don't lose it all over the summer.

I had math class, then went to flute lesson, then went on a walk with cory, then went to church for our Mexico Celebration. It was so weird seeing everyone so clean! :) Then we left early to pick up our exchange student from the airport! His name is David, he's 19 and just finished his first year in college. He's studying to be a plastic surgen. He's kind of shy and doesn't talk that much, but he's still alot of fun. 
Thursday after math class I stayed home and practiced and ran for the first time i na LONG time. then I went to the Watts for the Welcome Party. It was so much fun. I hung out with Kylie and Kristen mostly. But we had some fun joaking about the PDA night with Matt, Annissa, and Nick. 
Today was tons of fun. After class I got home and was home for about an hour then went to the mall with Emily. We were too flusterd to really shop that much so we walked around and talked... (Lots of interesting things going on at church right now.) then we met Kristen at Starbucks and talked for about an hour. That was lots of fun. :)

We blew up a cell phone... well kind of... (Sarah... it was Andrew Emmarson's idea that should tell you enough.) Lots of interesting things have been going on. After the picnic Emily and I hung out and we had a burning paper party after we drank our slurples. Then we went to see the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants because we had to see it together. (i'll still go with you natalie i owe you a movie anyway.) Today has been a hard day but my friends at church and Emmy have really helped me more than they will ever know.

Tommorow morning at 6:30 am our youth group will be leaving for LA and Tijuana Mexico for our Missions trip. I'm excited but not really I don't really know how to describe how I feel. think I know what you mean about not really being excited though Sarah. I have just needed to get away from here for the past two or three months well since Disneyland. Just everything at home and school has caused me alot of stress. ITs been a nice thing to learn to give that all to God (mostly because StressGiven headaches are not fun.) If anyone bothers to care  the thing that I have been NEEDING the most is somoene to hold me accountable/ desciple me and I really really am getting this feeling I've found the person, but it's all up to God right now and so if anyone would please PLEASe pray for that... I don't really want to say much about it now but just pray God will know. I am hoping that this trip will make me like our youth group better. The prep for the trip has, and I'm really excited for the relationships (hopefully really good ones) that will be built.  It's going to be so much fun since were camping... The shower situation though is kidna freakin me... but I get to be in a tent with the nurse , Katie, and I'm sOoo excited to get to know her! Well I'm going to go do some last minute things. I'm not going to write much about my trip when I get back (unless for some reason God wants me to) so I guess if you want to know how everything goes you'll have to talk to me. ANd if you don't want to talk to me then too bad it's your loss. We are getting back on July 3rd. 
If you think of us please send up a prayer or two , or three.... 
Have a good summer  guys! (and gals!)

ESPECIALLY when you are trying so hard not to do that thing then people notice the one time you slip, or say you've done it when you really haven't and it makes me so upset. It's brought me to tears so many times in my life!  ANd it happens EVERYWHERE. It's like when you try to go with out drinking pop becasue its bad for you, and you go practically 6 months which is a really long time for someone who drinks one to two cans a day, and your so proud of yourself! But then you make one little mistake and everyone laughs at you and brings it all up in your face and makes such a big deal about how you can't keep a goal... its frusterating!  OR like wehn you try and try and try and you think you've done such a great job at something.. and really you have, you've made it so sparkly and clean (this is just metaphorically) that you think there's no way anyone can find somethign wrong this time! But sure enough someone points out one little tinny tiny speck, the smallest spec in the world, and nags you about it. 
Why do we notice all the bad things people do? Why can't we all just compliment eachother? You know I look forward to year book signing because its the one time people say something nice about me. No one teases or nags you or talks about stuff you've done wrong. They say all the things they appreciate about you. I wish we as humans did that more often, said nice things about eachother that is."

"event","Wow this weekend has kept me on my toes so far! Its nice its like I'm being kept busy, but at the same time its not like a super stressed schedual (well tommorow kind a is). Anyway. Yesterday was a really fun day! The actual school day was even fun! Kelsi and I went to starbucks for lunch and I got something (with no coffee in it) that made me totally hyper. IT was bad. THe history test went really well I thought it was easy but we'll see when the scores come back.  After school Blake, Colleen, Kayshia, Amanda and I stayed after to help Wilson for a bit.  I saw Jake after school again. IT's weird cus like I'll think I'll see him somewhere, and then he won't be there, but when I don't expect to see him, I do. IT makes me sad at the same time it makes me happy. It's kind of weird. 
After school Kayshia and I went to Amanda's house. It was fun. We had fun making quesdillas and playing with my cell phone and Amanda's instruments! :) I guess we're just having to much fun girls huh? :) THen it was off to the concert and alnighter! I thought the concert was alright. Long but alright. The slide show at the end was so good! I was really glad Wilson did it. I thought it was cute he included some of the 8th graders. Well at least Scott, Cory's brother was in it like 3 times. OH guess what?! I won a game of bump at the alnighter! (For those who ahve been in PE with me you know that's impressive!) OH I was so happY!  It was so much fun hanging out with Amie, Brittany, (I wish Jade had been there :() , Teresa, Kristina, and getting to meet ALina. She's really nice and so cute! I'm excited for her to be in band next year. AND JENNA AND LINDSAY CAME YEEAAAHHHH!!!! 
ALl in all it was a good night, even though there were a bunch of people getting on my nerves. I think aside from bump and kerioki with Kristina probably hanging out with Cory, ANdy and ALi was really fun! Ali is so awesome! (ANdy's girlfriend) I'm glad I've gotten to know her as Ali and not the girl who calls Cory the chicken man. ANd We had fun trying to ""escape"" from Wilson. ANd talking about band lol. I am so tired. Today was my audition. I had gotten four hours of sleep. But concidering, it actually went really well and I am pleased with myself. WHen I got home my mom made me clean most of the house because my Godparents Aunt Cathy and Uncle David (Who aren't actually my Aunt and Uncle but we call them that anyway.) are comming tommorow!! I'm so excited! I Havent seen them in four years and I absolutly adore them! :) They live in Indiana. ANyway well I'm going to go see Mr. and Mrs. Smith with Cory so I will talk to everyone later. 
Hasta."

"event","Well if you don't want to read this because its about me then you probably shouldn't be reading my live journal. Okay that was random and I dont know why I said that but ya. 
So basically my last week life was consumed with my LA exhibition. I've had pretty much an awesome week. No bad days, no arguments, just a good week. Well exceot for Friday which was sad. I miss you so much Jake!
 But anyway. So last sunday was our all day mexico training day.I was so not looking forward to it, and thought it would take for ever but it was so much fun. I am starting to like my youth group alot more than I did. Andrew gave me a bruise and I kissed a salamander that Nick said was poisioness... that was the highlits of my day. 
Monday we had our flyer hand outs which was alot of fun too. I got to hang out with Greg, and I really enjoyed that. I think I'm going to miss him as a youth leader alot more than I realized but I'm glad Nicks the one who's replacing him. After the flyer day I went to Ryan's house to work on our video. I was there from like 4 - 8:30. It was so much fun. I absolutly loved working with my la  group. I'm sad we won't be hanging out nemore. WEll maybe I'll hang out w/ Chris Parr sometime.. seeing as how he still owes me a lunch and a phone call lol. Our video turned out really really nicely. I was really proud of it. 

Finals week this week yuck! 

Yesterday was fun. Well the mornign wasnt cus I took the Sats. A bunch of people from our school were there also.

Last night I went to Teresa's church and we had a party. It was so much fun. I was the only junior there, and the only one besides Carrie Anne that wasn't a freshman, but I really love those girls and it was tons of fun. KGBis the best game! Besides Fugitive and Mafia.. Lol isn't funny that all the fun games are like spy type games? see the connections? lol. 
Today has been kind of dull .  I was suppose to go see Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants with two different groups of people, but ended up not going at all..
WEll That's about all. I'm gonna go play my saxophone.

"event","So this weekend has been so much fun! To anyone else it may seem boring which is how I was thinking it would be going into it but it's been such an awesome weekend! So friday after school I started cleaning around 4:30 pm and didn't stop until 8 when my dad's cousins got here. They have spent the weekend with us because of my grandparen'ts anniversary. They have a 4 year old (Cameron) and a 5 month old (Ruthie.) SO that was friday.
Saturday was long and tons of fun. I helped set up until like 12 ish then talked to Cory on the phone for almost an hour, then when I came down stairs my uncle from California was here.. I was excited. My uncle and  I went and got all the fruite and pies and such. And then people started comming at 3. And it was so much fun! there were 50 people here. I was so excited cus I didnt know my 2nd cousins Chrissy and Rachel were comming and they are my age and the only girls besides me in the family. (as in young girls). It was so fun I havent seen them in forever. And my cousin Carson is my age also so I got to hang out with them. But my cousin chrissy and I were talking.. and it got out that I have a boy friend and so the whole family had to know everything.. ya that was fun.  
   My aunt meg made a slide show for my grandparents, and I just started bawling during it. It was funny cus usually I don't cry at things like that. Like I usually (sadly enough) only cry when I don't get my way..(well I use to not as much now). 
After the slideshow and desert the friends of the family left and it was just the family but like all the family so there were still about 35 of us and we all gathered in the living room and were sitting around (the little uns were out side though) and my (2nd??)Aunt Hallie and Aunt Mairi and Aunt Florieanne started singing songs (cus theyre like REALLY REALLY Good.. like thats where the musical side of me comes from..) and we sang a bunch of hymns, and musical songs, and just songs that everyone knew.. and it was so much fun we did it for like an hour -2 hours.. and it was so neat just all sitting there as a family singing songs. 
People left around 10 and then we had to go up to Papa and Grandmas church to get set up for today, and we were there until like 11 ish. 
This morning we had to go to Papa and Grandmas church. I love their church though it brings back so many child hood memories. After service they have a ""coffee hour"" and it was dedicated to Papa and Grandma, and we had cake and left over fruite and all that fun stuff... 
Then i had my mexico meeting.. 
So its been a busy weekend
and tommorow we are going to seattle (on the train cus my grand parents are like obsessed with trains) with my aunt and her family and my uncle and my grandparents. 
I'm sad cus all the out -of-town  realitves are gone now :( 
But my aunt and uncles are still here so I'd better go and join the party! 
Ill see you all tuesday. 
Call me on my cell.. I'll probably be bored lol.
P.S. HAPPY 16th BIRTYDAY SARAH (for tommorow anyway)"

"event","Okay so I'm cleaning the house for a bunch of people comming over tommorow to celebrate my Grandparent's 50th wedding anniversary (which is today), and I was on the stairs, looking over the ledge to see if my parents had left yet. And I put my foot off of it onto the ground (now I've done this a thousand times  be fore , and nothings happend and a normal person would be just fine) and I trip or something and the next thing I know I've bonked my head on the corner of the wal, and went klump kump ker-plunk all the way (rolling) down the stairs. I tried to stop myself but ended up just hurting my elbow. So now I'm bruised everywhere (it feels like anyay) on the right side of my body.
So if you didn't believe I was a klutz before you should now. 
So I'm begining to wonder why I have never broken a bone or gotten stitches or anything.. (well I had open heat surgery when I wa 3 and 1/2 but that doesn't count.) lol.

Tommorow is my Uncle Paul's birthday, he died when he was thirty five, of cancer. I was only seven when he died.
 This has been a bad week. I wish it were over, or I could re-start it. But oh well wishing is useless. I even prayed and TRIED really hard to have a good day. 

Pretty much the only thing good about my day was when Micah and I got to talk while Kayshia and Thea were doing something else at lunch. I love Micah, and I haven't been able to talk to her in a while.. so it was good. 

Im not at youth group becasue I am working on my homework.. I've been working since 5:30ish so I'm taking a short break. My cousins (ages 4 and 9) were here after school.. and I feel bad cus I couldn't play with them (even though they wanted me to) since I had/have so much homework to do. Its horrible and never ever ends. 

Those of you that know Ms. Stone (the orchestra teacher), please pray for her and her mother and keep them in your thoughts. When I was talking to her today after school about something, she got a call that said her mother had had another stroke. I don't know how bad it is or anything, she didn't even know, but it is a possibility that she may have to leave (tonight) to Alaska (I think..) to be with her mom. She said her mom wasn't taking very good care of herself after her last stroke and now she's hoping this one was enough that she will take better care of her self, but not bad enough for anything to happen if you know what I mean... I love Ms. Stone alot, and I know how much this is probably hurting her so if you could keep her in your prayers that'd be greatly appreciated.


OH and My grandfather is doing alot better! He has to take physical therapy but he's good for now, and at home.. and a week from this saturday (saturday the 14th) is his and my grandma's 50th wedding anniversary! :) 


Thats all for now I better get back to my homework (bleach)

I miss natalie. This has already and is going to be a long week. But it's state week and I like choir so thats a good thing... I nearly wore my voice out at lessons today though... anyway. my day was pretty crappy. it was boring and i found out our test in history is wednesday. and im not ready and didnt study tonight... but i will during 6th tommorow.. i didnt do any homework.. i worked out in stead and sang which I haven't really practiced singing at home in a long time and it felt good belting out loud with my voice. whcih is what i needed to day to get my mind off of things *people* that have been driving me crazy lately.So since I was singing Musical songs I was in the mood and watched like 2 scenes from like 3 different musicals.. and it made me feel better a little.
 I hate getting into fights with friends over stupid things and it's been hapening alot, and I always feel like i have to be on the deffensive (or is it offensive). If any of you care... today I read a really cool chapter of Isaiah (which is the book Im reading) its chapter 8 and I really liked it, and thought it was pretty powerful. 
So yesterday I did 200 sit ups and 10 push ups and I felt really good and wanted to do it again today but know better than to do sit ups every day (do them every other day) so I  did like 15 pushups when I got home from school, then about 30 minutes ago I decided I really didn't feel good or in shape and the treadmill was just calling my name so I ran for 20 minutes on a really high speed and burned like 130 callories..a nd  ran like 1.5 miles up/down cycles and I felt really good.. then I did 35 more pushups and I felt excelent..so in all I did 50 push ups today.. (of course they were all in incriments of 5 at a time lol I have really weak arms). ANd now Im going to go to bed cus Im exhausted and ache in my bones (in a good way) and am sweaty gross... lol I probably just bored you all but oh well you didn't have to read it so its your own fault.

April was a good month over all... a very interesting one to say the least.
This has been an awesome weekend. Friday night I went with Nicole to see Fever Pitch.. it actually was not that good. I don't like Drew Barrymore.. and sports annoy me after a while.. so ya it was a long movie... 
Anyway. Saturday morning I had to wake up for MYS and I was running late which sucked and I hadn't been there in so long I  forgot how to get to where flute choir is.. it was bad. but rehersal was good for both fc and for concert band. After MYS I cleaned the bathroom and my room (TONS OF FUn  lol) 
and 
then went to cory's house.  I was there until about 9:30 ish... Cory's brother reminds me alot of /like Chris Parr its really funny! We walked to fred myers to get his mom a paper and it was really funny cus his dad was there getting the paper only cory's mom didn't know that.. .oh well I guess you would have had to be there but it was funny.
 This morning church was really fun.. Emily like bomboarded me when I got there cus I hadn't seen/talked ot her in a while.. during service, Emily, Emily, (yes two emilys) , me, kevin brendon and daylon sat in the balcony. It was fun.. although I don't think  i Should sit next to Emily taht often when I'm in the service cus I didn't pay as much attention as I should have (although I did pay attention) 
after church we went to the Darlands house for lunch.. (maleah is in the sunday school class that I teach, and she has an older brother Gabe who is in 3rd grade and a younger sister Hillary who is 3 and absolutly ADORABLE) it was for this thing for my parents fellowship group... anyway then we came home and I practiced.. and I'm finally getting use (kind of) to my new flute embachure that Marcy is teaching me.. I did all my homework and ran.. so Now I'm done with everything I have to do for the day. It's a nice feeling.:)
I wish someone would please tell me where Josh hid my note book I really need it tommorow... I have no where else for all my new history papers to go :'( I know its in a band locker please tell me which one."

OH okay so yesterday I went to the doctor, and we were trying to figure out what's wrong w/me and she said the reason I've been thrwoing up is because my body's really sensitive to like all the snot and stuff since my nose is conjested and icky and its making me thrwo up.. that and also since ive been caughinga lot she said that tends to cause it also... well i just thought id inform you so if anyone is as bored as i am they can read this.. lol..  hmm .. now im thinkinga bout next year..

Today I was thinking about all my friends... how cool they all are and how blessed I am to have them as friends.. and I was thinking about like WiBC and everythinga nd choir and band and wow.. choir and band are so big in my life i sometimes wonder what it'd be like if had quit band after 8th grade like i wanted to.. hmm where would I be? interesting thought.. maybe ill go contemplate that... im so bored."

SO im sitting here writing my book report on Night, and I am thinking about food since I am hungry.. well this thought occured to me.. we have take out pizza but why not take out fast food? Would that not be so cool? SO your hugnry as your writing your book report, like me with no car.. and you can just call and w/in twenty minutes/thirty minutes have a meal arrive at your house.. and all you had to do was call?! that would be nice..
And the tuba is hard.
That was my ""rofound""thinking of the day."

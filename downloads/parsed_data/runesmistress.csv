"event","Egypt and Romania were very exciting and I had a wonderful time. I really wish I could come up with more to say about the trip. I am very impressed with the students, you all behaved yourselves very well, and showed tremendous class and maturity when you were expected. I hope you all enjoyed yourselves, and perhaps you should speak to Professor Lupin about doing this again next year. It's a big world out there, and you all should get the opportunity to see it.

George, next time you're up here at the castle, come see me. I have something for you that I picked up at a market in Egypt. I thought of you the moment I saw it.

Well, I'm off to grade some of the essays that you kids wrote on the trip <s>and fight of a headache I seem to be getting</s>. Expect them back sometime next week. So far, they look very promising.

"event","OK... how to describe myself right now... cold... I'm <s>fucking</s> cold. I'm beginning to regret ever coming on this insane trip. Remus, you're on my list now. Charlie... you're going on it as well because you like this place. This is why I left Scandinavia... too <s>fucking</s> cold! <s>I'm beginning to understand why people drink vodka around these parts all of the time</s>

Anyway, the kids seem to be enjoying themselves and are just in awe of the dragons. Charlie is in his element because he gets to see the dragons, and he gets to show them to the kids. Then there's me; standing off to the side with my parka pulled up as high as it goes. I'm decked out in fur lining from my neck to my toes. If one more kid throws a snowball at the back of my head... it's detentions for a <i>month</i>!

I'm off to the sauna... because it's the one place around here (besides my hotel room) that I know will be warm. <s>Perhaps I will thank Remus his suggestion of this wonderful trip later by throwing him out into the snow</s>

"event","I am so glad that Remus convinced me to go to Egypt all those months ago. It is so beautiful here. You would think that with my extensive studies and research in Runes that my travels would have brought me here. We've only been here for a day but... already I've seen so much. I throughally enjoyed taking the students into the pyramids of Giza today. The dark and quiet solitude of these mysterious works of architecture simply amaze me. We aren't going to be here for nearly enough days for me to see everything. I will most definitely be coming back again.

I have to slip away for a couple of hours. I've told Remus and asked him to keep an eye on my students for a short time. I have to track down the eldest Weasley child and give him those translations I promised him. I wasn't sure if I was going to get a chance to get away from the group for awhile, and I told him I would owl him my findings, but it'll be nice to go over the work with him in person. Plus, if I'm lucky, I might just get to see the original artifacts he found. I'm so glad he owled me with his questions. It may sound conceited, but it feels good to know that I am a renowned expert in my field and my opinion is sought out by others. I'm glad that I get the chance to converse with Bill in person.

I'm headed into Cairo for the afternoon to take care of this business. Hopefully the students under my supervision will respect their Defense Professor whilst I am absent for a few hours.

"event","OK, don't laugh at me, but I seem to have lost a pair of shoes. They're the kind of shoes I would wear to walk around the pyramids in. I can't even begin to imagine what I would have done with them. I mean, it's possible that I could have left them back home in Italy the last time I visited my mum... but she says that she hasn't seen them... blast, and they're her favorite shoes of mine. She probably has them stashed somewhere. <s>Charlie, if you have my shoes and this is some kind of revenge for the whole enforcing Dumbledore's enforcement of the formal dress code at the dance... hand over the bloody shoes!</s> I'm trying to pack for the DADA trip, and without my shoes... oh and they're nice shoes too; Italian leather and brown suede slip ones. Perfect for walking and still looking good... <s>dammit!</s>

<lj-cut text= ""Private""><i>OK, so... now that the kids think my only problems lie with my shoes, I can type up some more stuff... just to get it out there, somewhere.
Severus has created a cure for lycanthropy... I'm still in shock over that fact alone. I went down there last week because I'd heard him fighting with Remus. Turns out that they were arguing because the potion that Severus concocted had enough silver in it to kill Remus several times over. Oh I was so scared... so, naturally I dragged myself up to see Remus and completely broke down. I was so upset, and I told him so... probably shouldn't have, but what's done is done. He was insistent on taking it... and I should have never questioned it. I can't imagine the pain and suffering he goes through once a month and he deserves to live a normal life... so I left. And he took it... and I haven't seen him since. I know he's still alive... but that doesn't mean it worked! I should go find him.
As if that wasn't enough to know about... on Thursday I went down to ask Severus how everyting went with the potion, since I couldn't find Remus, and... I still can't believe what I saw. I know that when Remus used to transform, he was a grey wolf... that's <b>not</b> what I saw that night. What I saw in the potions classroom was a huge black, almost panther-like wolf. He was just sitting there, staring at a wall... as if brooding. I couldn't move... I looked around the room for a moment and didn't see Severus, so I went to his office... where there was a large smoking goblet. I know what it was, but I don't want to admit that's who it was for... what the hell happened between Remus and Severus? And if Remus (or another werewolf) bit Severus and now he's cursed... why didn't he take the curing potion as well. I should go talk to Severus... but how to confront that man? I have no reason to go down there... well I do... but it's not a good one. And it's not likely that he would even talk to me.
So, now that I have that out of my system... can I grin like a fool?! OK, I'm telling my head to stop acting like some love-sick fool... love-sick! Oh my god!!!!! I can't even put down into words what I'm feeling right now. I went to visit George to tell him everything that was going on with Fred and Charlie. He was really upset.. wanted to set Charlie on fire.. oh I'm sorry, I meant Charlie's stuff. My bad... whatever.. anyway! We talked for awhile and the weather got really bad... and you know me and snow... they don't mix. George insisted that I stay, so I did and we talked till like three in the morning. I don't really remember what happened to make him end up on the cold floor, but he was curled up down there and I was curled up on the couch... and I heard him say it... I know I did, I wasn't imagining it, or dreaming or <b>anything</b>... I wonder if he heard me say it too... because I did, and I meant it... I love him... I do... I <b>love</b> him!
I should probably stop, I've taken up about four pages in this journal and my hands are starting to hurt from all this typing.</lj-cut></i>

OK, the dance is only days away and I need to find a dress... I should have Mum send me my pink dress. I don't feel like wearing those stuffy formal robes.
I'm off to the owlry to send my mum a note. Have a good week everyone.

"event","For all of my students who are attending the field trip: please check your common rooms for a list of addition items you should bring on the trip. You won't need your text books, but you will need several of the handouts that I've passed out during the term. These papers are vital for the essays I will be assigning, especially in Egypt. I will be posting essay questions in your common rooms sometime within the next week.
<lj-cut text= ""Private""><i>I've reached a point in my life where I question everything. My mother tells me that when I was a child I used to be carefree and did anything and everything I could. I was a daredevil from the get-go and never looked back. When did that all change? Was it when my father died so suddenly when I was ten? Was it when I fell down a twenty foot shaft and would have died had a mediwitch not been on hand to heal the internal wounds? Was it when I found out my husband was cheating on me with a friend of our families? Or was it when I accepted this job, and realized that I held the lives of several hundred children in my hands?
I need to go see George... I <b>really</b> need to go talk to George and I don't know what's holding me back. Am I so afraid of Fred that I'm willing to jeopardize my relationship with George because of that fear? All these thoughts are running through my head right now! And Charlie... damn him! Why does he have to do this to me! Why can't he be happy for us... It's not fair! Oh, well now I sound like a two-year-old. Wonderful.
Wanna jumble up my head a little more? Well, there's Remus taking a life threatening potion this evening. Sure, it will more than likely cure him of his lycanthropy... but there's still a chance that something could go wrong, and it could kill him. So, we'll just add that onto my pile of worries... and my mother wonders why I ended up in a coma earlier this year. Actually, out of everything going on in my life right now, work is actually going very well. I'm looking forward to getting into some warmer climates with the field trip and giving the kids some hands on experience. It should be a good time... plus I get to do some shopping; something I haven't done in awhile.</lj-cut></i>

Charlie, you're a sap when it comes to those animals... and I love ya for it... but a note saying where you were going to be would hace been nice, you lazy sod. You had me worried sick for weeks, until I got over you and moved on to greener pastures... namely I got back to work and forgot you were gone. We have a lot to talk about... so you should come up as soon as you get a couple of free hours. I've got a new box of chocolates that I got from my mum, and I think I have a present lying around somewhere for you that's from Christmas... see, I'm not below bribary either luv. See you soon hon.

Seventh years... pay attention. The field trip is fast approaching and I do have lesson plans for you. I am meeting with Professors Lupin and Weasley later in the week to go over the final touches (as in to make sure that I haven't missed anything vital to your learning experience). Please be alert for updates. I don't want any of you to be losing points because you didn't prepare for the work properly.

Also, seventh and fifth years: with exams fast approaching, we will be having review sessions the week of Valentine's Day. I know many of you are preparing for the Ball, so I will go a little easy of you all and we will have review sessions for that week. This also includes my third, fourth, and sixth years who will have mini-end of the year reviews. Please come prepared, and that should be a light work week.

"event","<lj-cut text= ""Private"">My head is spinning... I can't think straight... I cannot believe this happened... I can't believe Fred did this... he actually impersonated his brother and... I'm still in such a state of shock that I can barely write. I thought that ""George"" was acting strangely... like he had forgotten conversations that we had had... but of course, it wasn't George, it was really Fred! I was shocked.. I mean, I literally had a panic attack. And Fred hates me... of course, he says that he doesn't hate me, per say, he just doesn't want me anywhere near George. Damn him! I tried everything to get him to tell me why he feels this way, and all I got out of him was that he thinks I'm trouble... why!? What did I ever do to him?

So, five... perhaps six hours ago he knocked me out. I don't know what spell he used, but it was powerful. Thank god I missed a staff meeting or Remus might have never come looking for me. I know that the spell probably would have worn off in a few more hours... but still... I feel edgy and paranoid. All my doors are locked with extra wards. My head hurts and I should floo down to see Poppy, but I'm too tired... I don't even remember how I got to, or when I went to my rooms. This isn't good.

I need to see George. The problem is that, when I do go to see him, how will I know that it's really him? How do I know it's not Fred? I'm so scared... but I have no choice. I care too much about George to just walk away. So... as soon as I get a spare moment, I'm headed into town... I just need to think of a way to make sure I'm talking to George and not Fred."

I didn't want to come to terms with getting older... but then George put things into perspective and I got over myself. So, why do we make a big deal out of the new year? It's just another day and we're just starting the calendar over again. I guess it's just one of my things... weird things anyway.

I usually do have at least one resolution though. I don't know what to resolve to do this year. I guess I should resolve to not work so hard this year so as to avoid landing myself in a coma again... that would be a good thing. I know there are other things to resolve... but those are best left unsaid for the time being.

Oh and Remus... if you're reading this... when are we going on that trip? I am dying to buy something from a foreign country that I will never use in this lifetime... preferably something gaudy and sparklie... my favorite things. Anyway... my point is, when are we going?

I'm off to finish some lesson plans. Before I know it, the new term will be starting... and I won't be ready for it. OK, so I will be ready, who am I kidding here?

I searched all over my apartment and office in the castle for it, had my mum looking for it out on the vineyard... finally George found it at his place. I don't know how it got there. I must have left my bag the last time I was over there. Anyway, here it is... and now I can update.

Problem is, there is nothing to update on. I lead a terribly, dreadfully boring life most of the time... only time something interesting happens is when I overwork myself and I end up doing something stupid. Classes have been going very well. My students are looking forward to going home for the holidays, but they seem to still be grounded and paying attention. A lot of my older girls have been off on cloud nine these last few days... apparently young Mr. Krum has come to Hogwarts and turned the female population upside down. Congratulation on that feat, Mr. Krum.

I'm looking forward to the field trip that is coming up. I will have itineraries to hand out to my students sometime in the coming week. Most of your work will be done in the Pyramids and includes work with translating and understanding the Hyroglyphics. There will probably be little work for my class in Romania (don't start cheering now). 

I must go work on these plans for the trip now. I want to compare my notes with Remus before the week is over. I also need to hunt down Charlie and have a chat with him about Dragons and... well other stuff including his brother. Enough on that... I'm off to work... what else is new!?

Do the words, I-know-you're-lying-through-your-teeth mean anything to you, Remus!? There is no way that anyone in London would even <i>have</i> these let alone be willing to sell them to you! I know when I'm being led astray... and now I'm determined to find out why... and for what reason.</i></lj-cut>

I got an owl from my mum. My grandmum is sick. I might have to make another trip to Italy soon. Yeah, the woman is a nag and she thinks that cooking with a lot of rum makes everything taste really good... but she's my grandmum... I can't imagine my life without her. I need to talk to Albus about getting some time off, just in case.

I'm off to teach my fourth years. I should probably check up on that stubborn-Charlie again, make sure he's not buried under his stupid lesson plans. Then, I guess I should go see Remus... he's had a tough week, I'm sure. Perhaps I will go see Aiofe this weekend too... and Fleur... haven't really ventured out lately to see other professors. Oh and I found the most interesting thing yesterday that I must give to Sibyll. I think she will appreciate it <s>I just hope she comes down here and I don't have to crawl into that hole in the ceiling</s>"

"event","So, I'm thinking about writing a journal article for <i>Decifrare</i>, an Italian Runes journal. It's near impossible because... well to tell you the truth, I can't speak Italian. I know I know... it's a sin... I lived in Italy for a few years, have an Italian speaking mother and grandmother and can do no more than say a few foul words in the language. So, not only am I researching for the article, I'm researching for the language. I need Remus... he knows spells to translate this language stuff.

<lj-cut text= ""Private""><i>I'm worried about George. I shouldn't be because it makes me overbearing and a nag... but I am. He seems so alone and lost and I feel helpless. I tried to talk to him, but in the end he just paced around my office... I tried to comfort the young man but.. he didn't want it. I know something is wrong with Fred, but George won't talk about it so I don't know the whole story. I wish he would find someone to confide in. He needs a friend to talk to... even just someone to listen to him. I fear that I may not be good enough... <s>and that kind of hurts</s></i></lj-cut>

I'm headed to Charlie's office. That man has buried himself under my lesson plans for two weeks. I can't believe he's this stubborn and won't ask for help! He needs to be hit over the head with a blunt object and then reasoned with. Perhaps I will tempt him out of his office with some of those chocolates my mother insists on sending me all the time.

Ciao"

"event","I really wish I had one of those chairs that swivels around and around... I'm sure I could transfigure myself one... but no, I never think of it. I just feel that if I swiveled around a little, my life would be less stressful... I don't know why I think that.

<lj-cut text= ""Private""><i>I've been debating on whether or not to look into this, but Sibyll made mention of a gambling ring among the students. Then, the student newspaper reports the same thing on Friday afternoon. Something is going on... that paper is very... what's the word I'm looking for? I made a joke to Charlie last week about the students making bets on a relationship between him and me... two days later, Sibyll mentions it back to me and on Friday it shows up in <u>The Scribbler</u> that the students have a gambling ring going on. Something doesn't... no, everything adds up, I just can't figure out to what. I need to talk to Charlie... I think we should set these kids up... get the editor's of this newspaper caught...</i></lj-cut>

I think I'm going to take a walk down the hall to meet our new Muggle Studies professor. I can't remember her name... isn't that awful! Not even thirty and I'm losing my mind... Poppy won't be very happy. I guess I should stop by Charlie's office this evening or tomorrow as well. I can't believe he's locked himself in his office all week.. he's going to end up in Poppy's care if he doesn't quit it... and I know he'll hate that more than I did!

"event","I couldn't believe my ears when one of my students started going on about death threats in the Ravenclaw common room. Where was their Head of House when all of this was happening? Enough of our professors are off on business... the ones that are still here need to be here for these students. I may be the new teacher on the block, but I won't tolerate this behavior among students. Mr. Boot, Ms. Fawcett, if I do hear about another ""brawl"" in your common room or anywhere in the castle, I will report you to your Head of House and then you'll serve detentions with me.

In other thoughts... the castle has been pretty quiet this week <s>aside from brawls in the common rooms</s>. My students have been working very hard and not giving me any grief... I'm beginning to wonder what's going on with them. Even my fourth years have... well I guess it feels like they've finally settled into the routine of their classes <s>and perhaps they've settled into their hormones as well.. no, you never grow into those!</s>.

I'm still trying to plan for the trip, but am coming up empty handed. I need Charlie's help, but he seems to have gone missing or something! I haven't seen him wandering around with Fang, but his students say he hasn't missed a class yet. He hasn't returned my owl or showed up for dinner in almost a week. I hope everything's OK <s>and if you are OK, Charlie... you're getting an ass kicking for scaring me!</s> with him and the family. I know the twins and his sister are away...

There are my fifth years. They're already panicking about the O.W.L.s and it's only the end of October. What are they going to be like in January? Back to work. Ciao"

SetMeFree826 (10:38:29 PM): when i was here for the israel day parade i got a very bad case of strep and sinus infection and my glands were very swollen. we went to see an infectious diseases doc up here and she wanted me to see an oncological surgeon.... we got stuck in nj because i couldnt fly home. i had surgery to remove a lymph node from my neck that was swollen - thank god it came back ok... but they still dont know why i was so sick for so long.SetMeFree826 (10:39:06 PM): bottom line is i have episodes where i get really sick and cant get out of bed on top of the normal every day infections that people come down with. and because i dont have a spleen, i get those normal every day infections more often than everyone else."

fuck you for having your health and destroying it. i hate you. i fucking hate you for ruining you life but some of us have lives that are ruin which we didnt chose. stop doing drugs and give me your body! it will work a hell of a lot better than  the one i am in right now.

"event","Do I dare do this?

I'm not so big about airing my dirty laundry... I'm not so big about writing down all those little thoughts in my head that I really like to keep to myself. I enjoy being more cryptic. But I dont know how to do that.

You know those things you cannot quite wrap your head around? Those life altering situations that you either say a. I am NOT going to deal with this (and you play the whole denial game with yourself) or b. you play a game with youself trying not to make those situations out to be as bad as they might.

I'm doing both with myself right now at this moment in time while I am sitting here, at my Aunt's kitchen in Edison, NJ not knowing when I am going home... If there were a beginning to start at then I would start there. As long as I can remember I have never been a healthy person. I was NEVER able to do the normal things other kids were doing growing up. As an adolescent I missed out on most of my life and now as a young adult the pattern is repeating itself. How boring.

I am trying to listen to myself and all I hear is my heart beating. That's how simple this has become. Living day to day became too hard and to strenuous in my given circumstances that I have come to live my life moment by moment. This, is not so boring. You'd be amazed at all the little things that people miss in their lives daily because they are too caught up in the day to day stuff. I guess I should be thankful that I am in a situation where I have this luxery. I'm getting there.

I wish something as trivial as breaking a nail or my cell phone drowning... or honestly, as my computer crashing were the day to day activies that I was experiencing. Looking back over the past few years, I'd give anything to be living in an apartment where people hate me, getting kicked out of said apartment, being trashed by said people, and ending up living alone rather than all of this. 

Being a ""sick"" person has become to boring. It's the same old. Wake up. Feel like crap. Go to doctor. Feel like crap. Have blood taken. Go home. Take a nap. Wake up feeling like crap. Somewhere in there their is some food involved. Go to bed. Wake up the next day. Get resulted from blood Test. Normal. Still feeling like crap... blah blah blah, every day is the same story. Maybe I should rob a bank. That would make my life a lot more interesting.

There is a difference between this time and last time though. I am a fully conscious adult this time around. I am aware of everything that is happening to me. I am aware of who cant deal with the fact that I am sick (again), I am aware of who calls me every day, I am aware and fully understand in medical terms everything the doctors tell me.. and I dont feel so numb about it all this time around. I think thats a HUGE difference.

Moment to moment, right? There is something else happening this time around that honestly, I NEVER thought would happen to me. I am praying. OK fine, given my history, I'm entitled to a bit of a tiff with the almighty but this time around, I dont have any angst. Seriously. There is nothing hidden in me that is angry one bit. On a moment to moment basis that changes... but at this moment, no anger. I didnt say what or who I was praying to or whether or not I believed in ""it."" I am starting to very strongly believe in the power of prayer. I dont care what it does for me or what it does for other people... but as someone who has nothing, it's giving me something.

lets see you try and decode this one.

1. while i was walking the other day i came to this scary realization.. but i couldnt find the words to really say how i was feeling. then i saw a commercial for ""the starter wife"" and the words came to me. ""You had your chance"" keeps echoing through my head. not just in terms of someone else but also in terms of my self. there were chances that i had, that i took. they made me really happy and there were others that i took that made me upset.

2. im spending my time trying to figure out what to do... i do my best thinking in the mall.. sad, isnt it. i sit, i watch people, and i think. when it hits me that i've been thinking too much, i will stop and at the moment i will be ready to act.

3. the words ""how are you feeling?"" are the most annoying words ever! i know people have the best intent and if they didnt ask, i'd probably get upset but comon... leave me alone for a little bit, ya know... its a double edged sword.

4. i'm ready to take that flying leap into something-ness. i did so well from sept-dec with life being up in the air and not knowing what was gonna happen and being 100% ok with it. i failed that game from jan-mid april... i'm doing a lot better at it now."

Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you babe
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong

Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around 
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find...

Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed 
You said that you were moving on now
And maybe I should do the same
Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, babe
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong

Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it

Let me paint this picture for you, baby

You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doing to you 
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes

You cheated girl
My heart bleeds girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right

But girl I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy
You'll see

(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Because

"event","im feeling broken.
im in some sort of routine that i really dont like.
i sorta just want to sit home and drown in my own self pitty but i have this awesome job that i wake up at 8am for every day and i also love doing that. who would have thought. so what am i supposed to do? maybe im supposed to just sit home and find a way to get through this instead of just staying busy. i'm down here and things are working out (aside from this body) and im so sad. i shouldnt be sad. I should be excited but i'm not.

i feel so broken.
i'm trying to lose weight. honestly, all i eat is peanut butter. healthy, huh?

this is the first day that i woke up and actually felt alone. this whole drama has been going on since the beginning of the summer and i guess there was a part of me that thought this was one huge nightmare and it would just go away. well, it is a nightmare and its not going away. i love how people care if i am dying or not but they dont care about how their actions are affecting. and it all comes around. months from now i'll get a phone call, and will i care?

this was all supposed to turn out so differently. if you lose your soul-mate do you go find another one? how can you have two? how can you then say this person wasnt the real one? how do you get to that point when you can look back and say, thank god that time is over. this summer was awful. so now the summer is over.

i have this awful twitch in my eye that i cant get rid of. sometimes my lip starts to quiver. i love the part when i leave the office to use the bathroom and come back with tears in my eyes. god almighty, this is just so rediculous. 

i dont think im a drama queens. i think i can usually pinpoint the way i feel when most people cant. i use words or the arts to portray how i am feeling.

normal has been taken out of my vocabulary. i do better when its not used."

"event","heres the way i think of it. this journal exsists for me to vent about the stuff that bothers me. i dont usually use this space to talk about all the happy things that are happening because those are the precious moments that i either keep to myself or share, person to person, with my friends and family. therefore, if what i wrote on here upsets anyone, i suggest you dont read it. i'm not going to bs on here. i am going to say what i am thinking at the moment i am writing. AUTOSAVED DRAFT AT 11:37PM. that's the point. get it all out on paper instead of letting it fester. apparently, it upsets people that i do not filter my own journal. uh, hello?? what i write in here is what i am feeling at the moment that i sign into my account. sometimes its a flood of emotion and other times its a word or to just to say what i mean and mean what i say. mostly, it's cryptic... afterall, who would write names on an online journal. that will just get you into trouble. when i have trouble finding a way to make it suitiable cryptic for my own tastes... i dont write. which is why an outlash of emotional usually comes pouring out at a time like this. 

who knew that coming back here would end up being exactly what i needed at the write time. my boss (at the job that I LOVE but dont talk about in here), keeps telling me that sometimes you have to be at the right place at the right time ""and you dont seem like someone who has the tendancy to be at the right place at the right time."" it's always about the timing. these are the words that are written in big letters above my desk (in a job I FREAKIN LOVE). 

my point is, for me, i just use this online journal to spew my feelings about the moment. i am not doing this as a update on the things that are going on in my life. i do not use it to stay in contact with people i might have lost. if you use this as the only tool to track my life, youre mistaking my identity and the things i value and you dont know me at all. so please, dont get the wrong idea about the vices you read in here. theyre not directed towards you or should be used to reflect myself as a whole. 

i'm excited for thursday. i just wish you'd leave me alone."

maybe i am making all the wrong choices but this just doesnt make any sense to me. i'm not denying the reality of the situation but now after all of this, how can i go back on what i've believed in?

At work, when we interview new clients, they come in with their resumes. you'd be surprised how many people have been in ""fiddler on the roof."" my claim to fame is always that i was tevye. i guess the lines ""how can i go back on my faith? on my people? if i try to bend to hard, i might break."" 

I'm tired of pretending i am something that i am not. why should have i have to change myself for people? i have never done that in my life and its gotten me into some trouble over the years. why should i start now? people come and they go back the problems always remain the same. 

contracts? contracts? maybe one day we will just get up and move to georgia. i wouldnt be surprised at this point if that happened.

Arms up in the air.

Soaking in the reality of what has just taken place.

She looks out into the ocean and wants to swin away. Her brain tells her she cant. Her heart is broken so it feels nothing. Shock overcomes. 

She looks out into the water so lost. Giving up. The waves come up and touch her feet. Why cant the water just take over? Why cant someone just give me answers? She says to herself.

Some situations warrent this kind of reaction.

3. the only people that might possibly understand anything about me being sick and i mean really understand, are being that have had tragedy and illness in their lives or were friends with me when i was sick.

4. years of seperation from the people you were once close to doesnt change the fact that in that period of time you've learned things about the person that would make you go back and not be friends with them in the first place.

[Hook:]
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Chorus:]
She go be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Getting the house off coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'bach or the Rolls
If I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if let you go

[Verse 1:]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know,
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
You can't stay, you gotta go.
Ain't no other chicks Spending your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her
Is what I hate most?
I don't want you but I want it
And I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
He's so arrogant and bold
She gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma 'cause

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go/
All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?"

"event","<FONT color=#cc33cc>i needed somewhere to write these thoughts- but i obviously cant have them in my regular online journal- seeing as these are significantly more personal. i think i like chirs, and im pretty sure that he likes me. but i worry bout jessy- cus i know that shes my friend- but still- shes a rather aggressive girl- like i know shes more forward than i am, and i think ab things like what if shes still persuing him? i know shes supposed 2 b my friend and all- but i dunno. and i miss chris- and its weird for me- cus i think this is the first time ive genuinely missed a guy-like ive SAID that i missed ppl- but really i could care less- and he hasnt been online today, and my cell phone is supposedly still taken away from me- cus i got it back this after noon- and he sent me the cutest text- it was ""Hows school? You didnt call me back yesterday i was sad. give me a call today if u can 704 507 4214"" i think that mayb part of the reason im telling ppl my cell phone is stil MIA is bc i dont want to call him- but its wierd cus we had a good conversation on the phone yesterday- like i really enjoyed talking to him- which was different bc usually talking on the ohone w anyone u like is weird cus ur like- uh crap- waht do i say next? and thers like an akward scilence or whatever- but like it wasnt that way. i dunno what my problem is- i want to talk to chris but i also dont wanna call him. im sitting here wondering like- what if hes out w someone else- cus its not like we're dating or anything- and then im back to worry ab jessy and if shes doing anything.&nbsp; i might just b worrying unnecesairily- but i really like it. like im usually not myself at all w bfs- like i get all nice and not myself- as strange as that sounds- hes the frirst guy i like who im actually myself around. and the way hes just so open- i believe everything he says bc i think hes really being honest. and my friends (catherine &amp; ryan- ryan esspecially)think that he may jsut b like using me-but i dont thnk so- at least i REALLY hope not. i feel so weird talking ab this stuff tho- it makes me feel so vulnerable that i can like someone and they can say they like me but then theres always a chance that they dont and they're just playin me- i hope hes not- i think i like him- im just glad i have this journal to write in. ~*~</FONT>"

"event","Oh, everyone love the baby. Oh cuddle the baby Abbott! What about me? Me, Spee! Why must momma call him Muffin Face Snuffle Butt? What is a Muffin Face Snuffle Butt?!?! He's a stupid piggie boy. 

Oh, why must I be stuck with these peons of guinea pig men?! Why, why must a I pine for my true love? *piggie tears* Gimli, why must you be so far away? How I missed you after I left the pet store! Then, two years later, who do I see? My one true love. He wheeked for me. Wheeked for me! How can they keep us apart? Oh, whoa is Spee. 

I think I'll drown my sorrows in my water bottle. *sigh* So is life, so is love. Damn, that's what Ollie says. 

Love
Spee"

"event","Will Ollie leave me alone? *sigh* I guess it is the life I must lead being one cute piggie. Gramma left my blanket for him to sniff and now he took it into his cage. My pretty blanket! He's kissing it and doing other things...other things I don't want to see. That's why I'm in my house typing on my lap top. Oh, if only Gramma knew I took her credit card to buy this...but I'm cute so she will forgive me! 

Love
Spee"

"event","Hmm, another tiring day for a piggie girl like me. I was very bored today so I sweetly asked Tommie if he would drive me to the mall. I love the mall. I like to buy things there--pretty things just for me. We had the opportunity today as all the humans were out of the house. So, we took the car and drove it to the mall. As I walked the mall people kept staring at me. I smiled and knew it was because I'm so cute with my little pink purse; however, Tommie felt differently. He said it is not normal for guinea pigs to go to the mall. 

Anyway, I bought a Cosmopolitan and I read it, making sure Ollie sees it from the top of his pigloo. Whenever a human enters, I quickly stash it away in my pretty pink pigloo. 

Oh, the food was less than stellar today. Mama didn't feed me, so it was Gramma. Gramma doesn't give me the big carrots...I don't like Gramma. I hope Mama feeds me tomorrow. I was so happy when she scratched me behind my ears. 

Oh, human coming for food. 

Love 
Spee"

"event","Carrots. I am hungry for carrots. Possibly a grape. The next person to enter the kitchen will hear my wheek. 

I need to make an icon. I think I might take my mama's icon of me. Except, I'm wearing a sombrero. I'd prefer one of me without a hat. Maybe a tiara instead. 

Love

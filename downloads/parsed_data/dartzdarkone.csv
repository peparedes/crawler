He feels that certain events will happen when it's deemed to be the right time. He chooses to get involved when it's necessary, and tends to stay back when he views the situation can work itself out. He normally carries himself with a regal presence, and allows others to do the work for him. When it comes to family, he's fierce to defend, much like Kaiba and Zigfried. He will fight to the death to defend what he feels is right in extreme situations. <br /><b> <br /><b>Favorites</b>: <br /><b>Make-up:</b> </b>Natural beauty over make-up. <b><br /><b>Food:</b> </b>Anything organically grown and naturally processed. <br /><b><b>Flower: </b></b>Pink roses. <b><br /><b>Colors:</b>&nbsp; </b>Light colors, blues of all shades, light grays and whites. <b><br /><b>Fabric:</b> </b>Linens, light fabrics that flow, velvets and leather. <b><br /><b>Drinks:</b> </b>Anything made from blueberries and raspberries. <b><br /><b>Holidays:</b>&nbsp; </b>Unknown<b> </b><b><br /><b>Sports:</b> </b>Fencing, martial arts, boxing, wrestling, gladiator games, war reenactments. <b><br /><b>Animals:</b> </b>Snow owls, falcons, birds of prey, whales. <b><br /><b>Other:</b> </b>Prefers to use magic than modern modes of transportation. He has no use for modern things, he's learned to adapt without them. He loves the arcane arts and is often seen reading a book of dead languages than reading a book with modern words. He has a high sense of self and prefers the company of those with a like mind than ones that he has to explain everything to, which limits his friends to less than a few if any at all. He's a loner by choice. Making friends to him means heartbreak in the future. Those that he does choose to get to know, become his friend until they die. (Being immortal isn't what it's cracked up to be.) <b><br /><br /><b>Dislikes:</b> <br /><b>Make-up:</b> </b>Women or men that wear make-up for other reasons than warpaint. <b><br /><b>Food:</b>&nbsp; </b>Anything artificially colored, flavored, imitation cheese and processed foods. <b><br /><b>Flower:</b> </b>Venus fly traps. <b><br /><b>Colors:&nbsp; </b></b>Black. <b><br /><b>Fabric:&nbsp; </b></b>Scratchy wools and sackcloth. <b><br /><b>Drinks:</b></b> Mead. <b><br /><b>Holiday:</b> </b>Unknown.<b><br /><b>Sports:</b> </b>Anything that isn't full contact or has anything to do with fighting. <b><br /><b>Animals:</b>&nbsp; </b>Any flightless bird and crabs. <b><br /><b>Other:</b> </b>Traffic jams, the smell of car exhaust, and the sound of a motor revving. <b><br /><br /><b>Special Ability: </b></b>Being that he's been told that he can no longer interfere with human development, he takes the back seat and observes people. He is immortal, with the power to manipulate time/space, telepathically communicate with anyone that he deems to be able to hold a decent conversation, and can teleport to anywhere he chooses. He prefers to use mirrors because they offer a better gateway to where he needs to go and just about every place has at least one. He also uses them to communicate with his friends, or allies as he calls them. He can not be killed by normal methods of attack, and since his soul is merged with Pele's, his new wife and a goddess herself, the only way he can die is if she dies and vice versa. <br /><br /><b><b>Medical Conditions: </b></b>Sometimes goes insane from his extended time on Earth. He often projects these fears through images in another's mind that he unintentionally invades from time to time. He has a deep fear of being the last person alive, but chooses to keep that fear to himself. He has a phobia of being alone. <b><br /><br /><b>Personal quote:</b> </b>Dear child, do you realize that you have sealed your fate by talking to me? Now you are cursed as well.</div>"

"event","I have felt the land being cleansed as Zigfried and the others took control over the demon and destroyed it. I felt the evil disappear and I am grateful that Mahado can now rest in peace. I have felt him leave Zigfried's body and the weight on his ghostly shoulders disappear. I have seen the change that this milestone has created. Zigfried is now the true king of his lands and his birthright is restored. My only hope is that this will last longer than just one lifetime. The love he has for his lands and his people is something to marvel. I have been told not to get involved in human relations ever again, unless there is a chance that someone will die. In this case, I had a feeling that everyone was going to be safe even though I wanted to help. It's no longer may place anymore.&nbsp;"

Trees moved in time with each breath. With this peace, there is a stirring underneath that most will miss completely. I shan't get involved this time. I can't. I have received a message from the God's that I can't get directly involved anymore. I have yet to know why. <br /><br />I sense a stirring of demons and angels. I have heard the cries of the spirits calling for help, and I ache because I can't do a thing to help. Is this my new fate? To watch helplessly as people die? I have done this before but that was before my soul was released from it's prison of darkness and misguided ideals. It takes a fraction of a second for a bullet to break the skin and claim a life and yet, I can only observe and watch the outcome from afar. The ones that I have allied with, friends, I suppose, will have to fight this battle without me. This is a crucial juncture with me. I have never felt so torn since the Oricalcos claimed my soul for the first time, guiding me to destroy humanity. <br /><br />I have seen the future that awaits and I dare not repeat what I have seen. I hope that I am wrong. I bow my head, not out of shame, but out of pain. I sense that the troubles that lie ahead are just a starting point for something far more sinister that lies in the wings."

I believe that we are in Zigfried's castle, and to top it off, Atem seems pretty much at home here. He's comfortable and relaxed, but the fact that the priest is here, I may have to wipe his mind of this event to assure that history isn't disrupted. I have a lot to do once Griffin is defeated. Now it seems that we have another force to deal with. Am I understanding this correctly? There are aliens now? Weird."

I have used this tactic before to gain great success, but there was a price to be paid. The ghost carries the pain with them to the afterlife. I have seen it first hand now, and it's even harder now than ever to make amends. <br /><br />The ghosts in Bosnia are no different than any others that are around. I sense a massive distortion of reality unfolding around us and I have no idea how to stop it. I have discovered that Griffin isn't a person, nor a group, but rather a name that the spirits gave in order to identify a disturbance. These spirits are reliving their deaths over and over again, and it's not just in Bosnia. It seems to be happening in places where there were a large amount of deaths in a short period of time, that haven't had the chance to pass peacefully. In other words, these people have died through a mass action that has caused their deaths. For instance, 9-11, Bosnia, the suicide bombings, the war in Iraq, and other menacing threats throughout the world have caused such negative energies, that it's hard to see the positive. <br /><br />Fear is feeding this vortex of negativity. I'm afraid that this is only going to get worse before it gets any better."

Not from what I saw, but rather, what poor Miruko saw. It's a good thing that Atem was quick to react and covered the lad's eyes. Luck has been kind enough that we didn't see much.

I did panic a little when a ten year old boy threw an ice cream cone at me and Pele stood up with a menacing glint in her eyes. I thought for certain that she was going to loose her control. I simply looked at her, took her hand and smiled. I told her that it was only ice cream and I seem to be wearing it well as I smiled. It calmed her down, which I sighed with relief internally. <br /><br />The wonderful thing about this experience with Pele is that she's doing a fantastic job understanding that people are accepting her, rather than fearing her. We rode on a few rides and the nice thing about being immortals, is we don't get ill at equilibrium imbalance. I look forward to seeing what the next day has in store for us. It's a nice prize for the both of us to enjoy."

Even though my status as an immortal has granted me stronger abilities, unfortunately, it doesn't&nbsp; grant me omnipotence. Seto has asked me to bring back Miruko. I tried. . . and I failed.

"event","I have felt the shift of balance. Namaka is angered and I can feel it. Pele and I have destroyed the stone, and it took all that I had to survive. To sum it up, Pele gave me some of her life force and now we are one. What ever pain she feels, I feel and the same goes for her feeling my pain as well. Since Pele and Namaka are connected, I too feel her pain. 

I can't let this happen. I can't allow the earth's pain destroy the lives of these two goddesses. I have been given a gift and oddly I feel overwhelmed. 

I thought I felt powerful enough, but I had to die first to receive Pele's gift. Perhaps it's my calling to remain here with Pele. Yes. I would say it is. The Game still has power over the two and Namaka grows angrier by the day. I fear something is about to happen to the coastal towns of Japan that are causing some of the pain. 

I give a warning to the people that are harming the ocean's. Be aware that Namaka is going to take action. If you value your lives, change your ways. Her patience wears thin."

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Enter the room to listen, don&#39;t eavesdrop. . . "">Yes, it's true that I have been seeing Pele. Yes it's true that we are lovers. What I'm about to say is going to take everyone by surprise and this includes those that have known about Pele and myself. <br /><br />Malik should not be blamed for keeping the secret of Pele and myself from the rest of you. I asked him to, for the simple reason that no one was truly ready to hear what I had to say without becoming judgmental and closed minded. <br /><br />When I revived Pele from her prison in the Abyss, I was told that the task that awaited me by the Great Overseer wasn't going to be an easy one. What I didn't know was that his plan was vague and it meant that I was the one that he chose to set Pele free from her revenge. I thought this task that was laid out for me to revive her was to rebuild humanity again, just like the stone once manipulated me into thinking all those millennia ago. I was wrong. <br /><br />When Pele came into my life, she nearly destroyed me. I felt her pain and her anguish towards her sister. Namaka was the object of Pele's wrath, her vengeance and her pain. It took me several months to figure out that Pele just wanted happiness. The Overseer knew this, and most gods are vague, he was no better. Pele took all those lives because of her jealousy for her sister's happiness. Namaka has a family, whereas Pele was alone. <br /><br />At first I thought that killing her would be enough, but now I see that this path would only lead to more pain. Namaka's tears would wash away the earth as she would grieve for her sister, and if I had killed Namaka, the world would be thrown into chaos and misery, cast into the fires as Pele's hate went unchecked. I couldn't allow this to happen. <br /><br />I had to come up with something and fast. At first I thought that manipulating Pele into thinking that I was going to be her loyal servant would be the answer. I was wrong on that assumption. The more I have seen her softer side, the more I began to realize that she needed to feel what Namaka feels. She only wanted to be happy. Pele's previous lovers never lasted because she never held their happiness while they were with her. No one wanted to be around her. No one loved her. No one. . . . but me. I have known loneliness. I have felt the pain of loss. . . .&nbsp; and I understood her. <br /><br />I thought that if I had told her what she wanted to hear, then it would buy everyone time to do what they needed to do. True, it would have worked, but then I would have been no different then the men that had betrayed her in the past. I couldn't do that. . . not to her when she needs me the most. <br /><br />I then made a decision that would change the way I would have been viewed, not only by all of you, but by Pele as well. Either way, I had to do what I did for many reasons. <br /><br />1. The Ultimate Game needs to be dealt with and the only way I can make sure that I get it out of Pele's hands is to distract her. The only problem with this plan is that when Pele finds out that I took the game, she may more than likely kill me for betraying her. <br /><br />2. The Oricalcos Stone is very much alive still. The stones that were destroyed were the ones that were on the surface, but not the meteor in which the stones broke away from. I can still feel it's power surging through the Earth. Strife is continuing and it seems that Namaka and Pele are sensitive to it since they are elemental goddesses that are sensitive their mother. The good news is that the power of the stone is waning. The bad news, it may come to collect my soul to sustain itself. Pele said that she would help me destroy the stone, but the other issue is that I may die along with it. Perhaps the stone has something to do with why the gods are behaving this way. . . . I hope to find out soon. <br /><br />Either way, death will greet me, either by stone of by the hands of Pele herself. <br /><br />Pele knows that Namaka now has a son. I don't know who he is, and neither does Pele. <br /><br />Pele is under the impression that I am supposed to bring all of you to her fortress. At first, I was going to do just that, but then something miraculous happened. Pele confided in me that doesn't want to fight any longer. She wants to forgive Namaka and move on with her life. The trouble is, can Pele truly know how to forgive? I think she can. She shed tears, and I was there to kiss them away. She showed me compassion and I was there to hold her hand. <br /><br />Yes, she's capable of forgiveness. Yes, she's capable of love and yes she's capable to trust me. Otherwise, she would not allow me to go free. Therefore, like Raphael has mentioned to me once before, in order for me to show her that I truly love her and trust her in return, she will have to be the one to destroy the stone, no matter the cost. <br /><br />I will do just that. <br /><br />Amelda, if I were to die tomorrow, I want you to know that no matter how poorly you have treated me these past few days, I will always believe that you will do the right thing. Trust Kaiba and he will return your trust ten fold. Open your heart and he will see just how truly special you really are. That also means telling him about the parts of your past that hurts you the most. He needs to know that you trust him completely. <br /><br />Raphael, love will come to you in the most unexpected way. Be mindful of it's presence, for the one that is destined for you is mindful as well. You have all the tools you need to survive, but you don't have the love of another to fill the void that rests within. <br /><br />Kaiba, your love for Amelda has taken a serious turn.

Your bravery that day with the doctor showed more heart than anyone I have ever seen. <br /><br />Pegasus, your cunning in the verbal sense is grows more interesting by the day. Your open mindedness is most enlightening. I enjoy our conversations and your uplifting laughter. Although I am still a bot confused as to why a grown man would like kid shows. <br /><br />Malik, your devotion to your family has taught me a valuable lesson. Never turn away those that need you the most. It's through you that I have learned to love again, even if it's the love of an enemy. It's your ability to see the good in everything that has taught me that even the most hardened of people need a subtle touch to get them on the right path towards salvation. Thank you. <br /><br />Thank you all for everything. For your friendship and your trust. I will carry this memory with me for eternity. <br /><br /></div>"

"">Training the Pharaoh is a bit like training someone with one hand to clap. Granted that he knows magic and the concepts of it, his abilities lies with the Gods, not with the earth itself. Some would say that magic is magic, but certain magics require more skill to manipulate than just simple conjuration. There is hope, however, in teaching him. He does have a strong sense in the balance of nature. I can use this to help him understand and control the forces better. The trouble is, since he's a part of another, meaning that he shares energies with another, this can prove most difficult indeed. <br /> <br /> His understanding in the uses of natural energies through means of crystals have proven beneficial, his troubles lie in his shared mind. This other soul within has become a block. I know what this means. Teaching him and his other self isn't a simple task. I have little time to show both of them. I feel something is about to happen and I can't waste time finding a solution. I can at least teach him the meaning of the stones, but nothing more I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> The test I gave him was a simple one. He was to show me the life force within the flower I presented him. Since the flower was still in the pot, it's life force was still in it's pure state since it was still rooted within the element of earth. What happened instead was puzzling and disturbing. Instead of showing me the life force within, he drew the energy out, absorbing it, therefore killing the flower. Advanced users of crystals and stones can't do that without some sort of external force. Hmmm, perhaps this test has shown me more than what I had expected. If he can draw energies out, perhaps whenever Pele possesses another body, he can use this to extract Pele and leave her in her raw state, allowing Namaka to do what is necessary. <br /> <br /> There is a problem with this. He hasn't learned control. He has a strong mind, true, but he lacks the discipline necessary in order for this action to succeed. I shall investigate further just to make sure that he has all the tools needed to accomplish the goal. <br /><br />I received word that Zigfried has nearly lost his humanity when he was stabbed with a scalpel thrown at him by a possessed doctor. I had to intervene. Once I had finished my teaching for the day, a visit to the hospital was in order. I wasn't pleased. Pele possessed a man of healing and tried to cause harm. This is getting serious. Once Zigfried was strapped down, I sensed he was fighting with all that he had to keep Pele from trying to get out and manipulate him. I was very surprised that his will was able to fend her off for as long as he has. It also helped that he wore a blue lace agate on his ring and around his neck which protected him from evil and helped in his confidence which was surrounded by diamonds which are used for friendship and luck. He was very wise, even though he thought that they were just simply pretty and not knowing the full uses of the stones, nor their meaning. *sideways glance* <br /><br />I gave Pegasus before his surgery, a turquoise which would protect him from harmful vibrations and possession. I hear he is recovering well. I am glad to hear it. I'll pay him a visit soon. <br /><br />I do believe that with these stones, we may be able to fight her off easier, but it's convincing the masses that these stones work, is going to be the trouble. Perhaps Seto's power of persuasion may help in our cause and rid of this rampaging goddess from these halls of healing, or better yet, placing these stones while casting the chant may ward her off. I wished I had thought of it sooner than now. *sighs* <br /> <br /> </div>"

"event","We have arrived at the nearest hospital in Tahiti. Kaiba made his explanation, then left again without having his own injuries treated. His main objective is to find his brother and his lover. He enlisted my help and I felt obligated because I knew their last known location. I looked on as Malik was taken into the emergency room first. I would have healed him myself, but my powers were extremely limited because of Pele's hold that she had on me drained me when she left me for dead. I had very little left to give. 

Once Kaiba went into the helicopter, I noticed that he has grown pale. He looked terrible, but his focus in finding his loved ones had driven him to a new level. He was determined to find them and he needed my help. I doubt that he trusts me after all that I have done to hurt him. I do believe that he's relying on the old proverb, ""Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer."" I am no longer an enemy. 

I lead him to a very secluded area but the place that was once serene is now riddled with debris and the ground looked terrible from the earthquake. My heart sank when I saw it. I hope that the two of them survived. 

Kaiba lands the helicopter in a clearing not far from where I had left the two. We travel through the woods to their last known location. There is no sign of Makuba or Alister. I hope they are all right."

Since Pele is distracted by Namaka, and the others, I have used this as an opportunity to take advantage of the situation and let them go. I inform them that there is a chance that the battle has begun, and this time, in Tahiti. <br /><br />Alister looked at me as if I had lost my mind, but when I informed him that she left me for dead and her hold on me no longer stands, I was very serious. Alister didn't hesitate as he struck me. I fell to the ground feeling pain and knowing I deserved it. I didn't fight back. Instead, I stood up and said that he shouldn't waste his time on me and to get Mokuba out of this place. I explained to him as we were leaving, that Pele has found herself a new pet and her attention is no longer on me. <br /><br />Alister took a look at me and knew something was wrong. I went to a scrying pool to show him what I was talking about. The waters in the pool showed the Kaiba Corp helicopter and the others fighting off Malik. Kaiba was burned badly on his arm, as so was Zigfried? We saw the whole event unfold. <br /><br />To start with, this is the event so far as we watched in horror. <br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""look into the srying pool. . . "">Apparently, there was an argument between the pink-haired one and Malik that started this whole thing. I was feeling the grip of Pele loosen at this time. Pegasus tried to negotiate the strife and failed. Kaiba mentioned that he was leaving in five minutes and if they wanted to leave with him, they had five minutes to get there, otherwise, he would leave without them. Malik followed as he called for his helicopter. <br /><br />Malik became upset when Pegasus and Zigfried arrived. I couldn't hear the exact words because of the winds and the sound of the rotors, but what I could gather was that Malik told Kaiba that they should leave those two behind and not look back. Kaiba refused. He seemed upset that something like that would be asked of him. Kaiba then looked over his shoulder to see that Malik had Pegasus by the collar and he was smashing the pink-haired one's fingers with his foot. Kaiba tried to subdue Malik/Pele, which at this point was very late. He tried to wrap what looks like a cargo net around Malik/Pele, but by then, he daftly moved away still having a tight hold on Pegasus, and burned Kaiba's hand. <br /><br />When the pink-haired one tried to fight back, Malik stomped harder on his hand, and what appears, broke two of his fingers. Pegasus fought back as he kneed Malik/Pele in the groin and punched him in the face, sending the possessed on off of the pink-haired one off balance. Pegasus then took this opportunity to get the others out of the helicopter and to safer ground. Malik/Pele threatened to send the helicopter in flames, but Kaiba informed the possessed one that it wouldn't work because of the compound that is used for the fuel. <br /><br />Once the others were out, Malik/Pele seemed caught off guard. That's when I made a rash decision, mainly due to Alister's and Mokuba's desire to help out Kaiba. There is something else that is in the works. <br /><br />Apparently there is another force that will be working here soon. A force of greater proportions of the supernatural. It seems that Marik, Bakura and Ryou are working together to defeat Pele without the aid of using physical means. I hope for the sake of Malik, that their plan will work. <br /><br />Namaka is gathering her forces to stand up against her sister Pele, and it seems that the tables are turning in our favor, we hope. At any rate, the Pharaoh has offered himself to Namaka so she can bestow her power to him. She has chosen another, I'm certain, which is most beneficial to the water goddess. I have a strong feeling that I know who she's chosen. The Pharaoh isn't capable of handling her powers and he would be foolish to volunteer so readily to a goddess that he is unfamiliar with. <br /><br />I had decided to teleport us all there to the scene but it came with a price. Since I was already weakened by the death that she had tried to send me, I would be drained further by this action. The further that we can manage to keep her from her point of power, the easier it would be to weaken her for our chance at victory. I have managed to keep Alister and Mokuba safe until they are strong enough to help in the battle. <br /><br />All of this happened because of my own foolish pride. I'm sorry. I did all I can to stop her once and I was foolish enough to think that I could do it alone. I was wrong. I have brought this about and I will want to see it end. I may not be able to defeat her myself, but with the help of everyone, we can over come her and send her back from whence she came. <br /></div>"

I watched all of you drabble on about your meaningless lives, and quite frankly, it bores me. Afterall, I have developed patiance, which is a learned trait from being alive for ten millinia. 

I did, however, read something rather amusing. It was once said that Altlantians were considered aliens. How dreadful. I was amused as I read the article in the magazine of Scientific Amercia, that I laughed so hard. How these scientists think is something of a wonder. It seems that no one would be interested, so I'm not going to post the article. It would more than likely be a waste of time, and most of you seem to lack the comprehension skills to understand to begin with.

I have thought about the extensive ideas that I have come up with. Those of you that are reading this, here is my plan. Since reviving the Leviathan was a failure, due to the pharaohs interference, I have to think of a new plan. I was brought back by the Gods to finish what I started. They grow bored of the existance of humanity here. 

Lies and corruption is at an all time high. It's sickening to think that people live on with their meaningless lives as the politicians and corporations continue to milk societies of all of Earth's precious resources. Quite frankly, it's disturbing. Gasoline prices are at an all time high, because of the greed? Not really. My theory? The Earth is being tapped dry. Without oil, there will be sinkholes which can cause severe environmental damage. Not to mention the wildlife are being driven out of their homes. Why? Deforestation. This world needs a population thining. Too many people are taking the natural resources for granted. 

Conservation methods that are in place are not being heeded. It angers me. Earth needs a saviour and I am he! 

How Mokuba fits into this equation. Simple. I need an extra pair of eyes to see. Through him, I can see to it that there is no one abusing the Earth ever again. I have no interest in Kaiba Corp, in all honesty. The company can rot as far as I'm concerned. Even though it's assests are useful, but what I'm after is something far greater than mere money. I want this world purged from the abusers of natural resources and if I have to destroy all humanity to achieve my goal, then so be it!"

"event","Why that little imp!! He's not only pulled my hair three times, he's kicked me in the shins twice, poured honey in my hair, and pured salt in my coffee!! He's a menace!! 

As soon as I recieve my answer from Alister, the sooner I can start his training. *sinster laughter* 

I can't handle his tomfoolery for much longer!! Taking his young soul would only pose more trouble than I care to have at the moment, but if he keeps this up, I will have to do something with him!!!"

"event","I seem to miss something. Since when did Alister take care of Mokuba? Kaiba seems to be missing and Alister is taking care of him. Poor lad. Well, if Kaiba is missing and Alister is watching over the young one, then nothing is stopping me from taking his company once more. How I'm going to do it, is none of anyone's concern. I don't need advice. Just a little time is all I need. *laughs*&nbsp;

I seem to have come across something that seems out of place. I have never met the spirits of the Millenium items, but they do intrigue me. Hmm, I think it's time I paid them a visit."

"event","Yes, my dear child. If you have come here, then either you grow tired of your existance in this world and would want to change it for the better, or you're nothing more than another one of those internet lackies that have nothing better to do. Either way, you will succumb to my power and follow me into the depths of oblivion as I plunder this world into chaos until it is no more than a wasteland. 

Yes, I think you know what I speak of and you know it is the truth. 

Oh it seems that I have lost track of time. I must find my wayward swordsman so I can start relieving this world from corruption and lies."

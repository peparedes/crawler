"event","Just have a little patience
 I'm still hurting from a love I lost
 I'm feeling your frustration
 Any minute all the pain will stop.
 
 Just hold me close inside your arms tonight
 Don't be too hard on my emotions.

 'Cause I
 Need time
 My heart is numb, has no feeling
 So while I'm still healing
 Just try and have a little patience."

<lj-cut text=""Tough getting older""> 
Seems like nothing is black and white anymore <br /> Shades of grey and I feel a weight over my shoulder <br /> It's tough getting older <br /> I always thought that I knew where I'd want to go <br /> Now I'm here and I find that I'm still getting colder <br /> It's kinda tough getting older <br /> <br /> Here before my eyes, many roads ahead <br /> Time for me to choose one way now <br /> If I take a chance <br /> What lies down the road <br /> Feeling so confused, turned round <br /> On and on, on and on <br /> yeah yeah.....

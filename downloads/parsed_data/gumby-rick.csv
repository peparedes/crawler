"event","Had a long talk with Dina today about going back into the Reserve. It's on both our minds that we're at war and they have been calling up a lot of Reserve and National Guard, but I don't want that to stop me. I just keep thinking that I'm running away from my duty and that bothers me. I'm going to check with the Retention people and see if I can get back into the 481st. If I can't, then I'll stay local and transfer to them when I can. It's freaky to think about going back after 2 years, but I really think it's the right thing to do. Now I just need to focus on getting into shape and losing some weight.

Finally talked to the girls last night after almost two weeks. Couldn't hear a thing since Trish had a bunch of her friends over and didn't bother taking the girls somewhere quiet. I know damn well The Ogre isn't around much and I hate that my little girls are being raised by a 16 year old felon. I'm dreading going back to court because I know it's not going to go well."

"event","And Here We Have Another National&nbsp; Writing Novel Month Writing Journal. Pleased To Meet You! Here's a little on the owner (and writer) of this journal. ((this quiz was taken from the questionnaire posted over at <lj comm=""kingdomwrimo"">, so I don't take any credit for writing it.))<br /><br /><b>Name/Nickname:</b> Joanna, Jojobeans, Jojo (most commonly used) and Soanna.<br /><b>Name on the NaNo site:</b> thefinalsky (how lame am I?)<br /><b>Age: </b>16 (D: so young...not)<br /><b>Location:</b> Southern California. The Inland Empire, if you must know.<br /><b>How many years involved in NaNoWriMo:</b> None, before this. This is my first year writing for NaNoWriMo, but I've written things like this before. Only 20,000 words less. :O<br /><b>How many won:</b> None! But I plan on trying really hard to finish. I like the idea.<br /><b>This year's genre:</b> fantasy, more than likely.<br /><b>This year's story idea, if you have one:</b> not entirely sure. There are a few floating around in my head though.<br /><b>Word wars?: </b>Sure! Makes things go faster, if you ask me. XD<br /><b>Favorite character in KH:</b> Believe it or not, Kairi. She's such a great character, I think. Never gets enough love, and is always considered the separation between Riku and Sora's <s>smex</s> love. I love Riku and Sora too though. And Roxas. And Olette. And Axel. -shot-<br /><b>Any other fandoms that you love?: </b>The Final Fantasies, most notably FFVII, because I love Zack and Cloud. Ouran High School Host Club. Harry Potter. Twilight.<br /><b>About you in general:</b> just go read my <a href=""http://jojobeans-kh01.livejournal.com/profile"">profile</a>. But hmmm...I want to be a psychology major when I get to college? Heh. But I'm rather mature, i guess...no matter how much what I do contradicts that statement. And I love green. XD<br /><b>Anything else?:</b> BRING ON THE CHALLENGE! :D"

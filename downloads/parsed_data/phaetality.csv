"event","Prt 1:Yesterday, Jan 26 was Australia Day which turned out to be an awesome day. Not to leave things to the last minute, Andy and I picked up some supplies Weds night about 830pm, hooray for late night shopping. Next morning, Andy rocked up at my place at about 845, Dad dropped us into perth foreshore by 915, so we unloaded Everything out of the car and as the car drove away we realised that we had ALOT of stuff to carry for two people. We had 2x24 pakcs of soft drink, a big rug, and esky, a bag of ice, and 2x unfoldable chairs and our back packs. So that is 9 things between 2 people :S anyway we managed to lug it all down there with burning shoulders. We wandered across the oval and picked a nice spot beneath a tree with shade and a parke bench, which turned out to be the best part of the spot, the extra seating. We played a bit of footy for a while until the guys behind us rocked up. They had a little trouble following instructions and failed in attempts to put their tent up, so we gav them a hand. this turned into us playing cricket with Chad, jason, Germany and a few others for a while and having a good time with them throughout the day.
Prt 2:We pretty much sat there chattin for a few hours until I went and met up with Sarah and jamie over at the ferry spot. Walked back to where we were based and no one was there so we went to meet other people. Quickly realising that today would be one huge day of walking and catching up with people :S. Luke, Hodgey and Brad turned up not long after that so we met up with them and played some more cricket and threw the gridieon (very australian sport) aswell as some AFL, everyone else showed up after that and i walked around a bit catching up with people. Got tired about 6pm and decided no more walking so i stayed underneath the tree for the rest of the night. The sky show rocked, bext part being when the let off everything at once, so loud and exciting. doesn't take much to entertain me.
Well i started this post this morning before work and now i am finishing it. Had a late night last night and got up at 6 this morning to go to work. Spent the day building a standee so now my fingers are hurting and bleeding. Now is the time for fish and chips at Freo then some Lounge till the wee hours and hopefully some sleep before i go to Pt Walter tomorrow. whew so busy. im off  </tr></td></html></post></logout></wave>"

 Arrived there about 1130 last tues night after work. got up around 9 and went for a surf for a few hours. came home, had lunch, did nothing until dinner. went out at night to the beach. cam home and slept. Now that is about the sum up for every day for the past week. Cool heh.
 the best parts of mandurah is doing nothing, and having no pressure to do anything, just lounging around.
 The highlights of this year would be laying on the beach until about 10, even though we ony did it a couple of times. Playing shoe-cricket in mandurah (best version of cricket: playing with a tennis ball and my shoe). having a Yummy Noodle Box ( you know the typical chinese food out of a box take-away. i thought it was only a myth, but NO it exists!), surfing EVERY morning for a week. and definitley the beach cricket. (edit: Oh and the endless amounts of table tennis played)
 So now i'm hoping im not working for the next few nights so that i can go to the Planet Shakers night rallies which will be awesome no doubt.
 Now to go and give Mokimo a run in the Park.
RB out."

Went to his house and i played WoW on his comp from when we got home until 3.30 in the morning, got up at 7 to have breakfast... baked beans on toast best breakfast ever invented. Played some more wow before trekking to garden city to buy my dad a fathers day present. just a photo of Alix and me and some socks... because lets face it, everyone needs socks. appart from snakes and severel species of mole rats. Met with tom and played 5 hours of more gaming at lounge till 5 ish. Warcraft is greatest strategy game ever. Was going to the movies with andrew,kt,tom but andy cancelled and it all fell in a heap. so we played HALO on toms new Xbox for 5 hrs more... an XBOX!!!!
So the past day and a half has been approx. 20 hrs gaming, 3.5 hrs sleeping and 3 hrs eating and that is what the ratio of life should be. I have found my old love of GranTurismo and shall be off to play that now... an XBOX! :O"

Went to SL yesterday night and had a blast playing games until 10. I renewed my love of Warcraft with a few rounds of Enfo, To sucked the first few times but i forgive him, it's only natural.
On another note, I have a new sworn enemy... that DAMN paperclip 'Helper' guy in Microsoft Office. If you have had the privilege of never meeting him, cease to read, if not, read on. No matter what you do or say, he does not go away. I mean You go to close the bugger and a help window pops up. so then 20 mins later when the window is accessable you close that and he asks YOU questions such as "" Do You Have Any Questions"".... doi. If i had a question i would rather call microsoft office in USA than deal with YOU. Even more so is there is no close button. just a hide button, which means he is still there watching your everymove... waiting for you to slip up and BAM another question, undermining your intelligence. I wish digital animation was really alive so i could kill him, then revive him then kill him again before he asks me any more so called 'helpful and userfriendly' questions.

Had a great morning drinking coffee eating donuts with mates. didn't care much for the photos. english wasn't that hard, the class watched the news while i read Akira(awesome manga comic, about 6 in the series). Then i received my intro calc test, i got 21 out of 48 which i was dissapointed in. not the mark but myself, yet exactly what i deserved. i always 'expect' to fail yet never do. This made me feel somewhat humbled. It was actually a nice feeling to fail. to feel like I'm part of the 'game'. i have not failed alot of tests ever. this would maybe be less than my tenth. I think it was a good thing, I'm not upset at all at the mark, it's a good feeling. Yay im one of them :).

After lounge, around 5, Me and Tom walked to Garbo with Josh and got lost in booragoon somewhere, finally got there and missed closing time so i didn't get food :(
Me and Tom played TimeCrisis3 for 45 mins or so and managed to waste 20 on that damn game, meh we weren't bored. Katie Showed up around 6ish and we went to see SinCity.
It is truly an awesome movie. Very well done. very arthouse. I can't say how good it is..   :) doesn't even come close. Full of blood and violence, but in an artistic way. I recommend it.

Went to the Snooker Lounge today with Tom and Josh initially and decided on the way there that it would be good to have enj come along with us, the more the merrier. We walked down there from garbo, got there at about 12-1230 and they had all this stuff in boxes, turns out they were updating their computers, but their old ones weren't disconected yet so we could still play. So  we played until 2-30 when enj showed up, by this time we were hungry and thought when enj showed up we would get some food, but decided to sacrifice food for gaming time. As we played they were setting up the new comps and they looked so cool, with neon lights inside them and the top of the range gear inside they would have cost around 3-4 grand each (10 of them)and damn are the awesome. They will be set up by Monday and so next Fri-Sat we will be down there testing them out. Anyway had a good day gaming with friends. Got home Talked to andrew for a bit and had some dinner and now I'm here.

Sorry that my entries are so light hearted and some-what boring, and yours are so d&m.. i promise i'll have a moment of thought sometime in my life...but not now...

Thats another day gone, On to play some Condition Zero and maybe some character shading for HD.

Mr Wetmore, coming from South Africa a fairly poor and dis-advantaged country, couldnt understand why people would do things such as violence and so forth in a country that is so rich and prosperous. He has seen a country and termoil and people do not know better or have nothing else to do but vandelise and damage their streets, but with an educated country as we are we really have no reason to result to that kind of things, he said if we pay for him he would take us around, and show us the condition of where he used to live, and then we would really appreciate what we have..
I tend to agree with his views, it made me realise how good we/I really have it. I get upset about little things, about not getting a game, new computer.. etc... but people over there dont have anything... and we really lucky.. Anyway it just opened my eyes to appreciate what I have... but of course that  doesnt mean i dont want more :P I think thats bred into us that we want more, think we need more, and not having anything will help us to rely God more often, i think that more people would be christian and go to heaven in poorer country than richer countries becaus ethey have nothing else to rely on, no toys, games, or even family sometimes so they fully rely on God, no material possessions to get in the way of loving God, meh im babbling and repeating myself, meh im babbling and repeating myself.

Laste few days ive been sleeping in, as already mentioned, and playing playstation while it rains, i love those days where you're not expected to do anything and therefore don't...
Hung out with Ali for a bit last night and talked about alot, was good fun but garden city is too small to wander around, you end up circling the same spot within 5 mins.
Another thing, I'm going to go to East coast of America because i MUST go to some comic book conventions, they sound like alot of fun. And now is about the time i really want money seems as thos EB and HarveyNorman are having massive software sales where you can buy games for around 50-80 percent off.. *drool*. What tonite has in store.. watching TV eatin chips and coke.. nice lazy night for a person with a lack of life...

Well thats just about enough babble for now...

Went to Quidam last night, and it was truely awesome, the things some people can do is amazing, i admire them s much, would love to meet some of them, sat there half the night with my mouth open in awe, and the rest of the night laughing my head off at the funniest things i have ever seen. and thats it.

"event","Had a good day today apart from the three tests i had today, which all went well. Got some birthday presents including $50, jack johnson cd and a yoyo(awesome)and of course.. the most best jacket ever, thanks so much guys for getting me that, some of you may not have seen it but ill be wearing it constantly. 
   The fun started when i got home, went to kt's and got my new mobile phone and mini-bike(both edible) then once i got home i decide to get my jacket straight away. So the next bus to freo was at 3.42 and spose to get there at 4.17(remember those numbers. well set off at 3.35 so i wouldn't miss is, 3.40 3.45 3.50 and still no bus, i got bored, 15 minutes sitting at a bus stop is not my idea of fun, close though. well it finaly arrived at 3.53(i wasnt counting..), FULL of emmanuel students! i hate being on a bus full of foreign scool people, anyway this really annoyed me because someone got off at every stop, every 10m. anyway we got about 15 minutes into the trip and the bus over-heated.. can u believe it, a double-bus full of people breaking down on the side of the road, so we had to wait for 5 mins for it to cool down, 10 minutes past and still no go. so then she(driver) checked it again and apparently the fan-belt broke.. like you wouldn't notice the first time you look! , so about 70-80 people standing on the side of the road waiting for another bus to come, again.. not my idea of fun. so 30 mins later a bus come and we are on the way again, got 10 mins up the road and because we were so damn slow the next schedualed bus actually caught up to us, so they decided to transfer 50 students + me, to the bus behind us. finally we are going again and eventually end up at fremantle... at 5.30!!!(dont add up all the times, im sure they dont add up, but i looked at my watch)anyway 1 hr 15 late... so finally 1 and a half hours later than i imagined i got my jacket! it woz worth it, i found myself a yoyo aswell, a 1337 competition yoyo, dont know how to work it yet but hey, ill learn..so i walked out, back to the busport to go home, and these Iona chicks came up to me and i got some chips off them.. they were using me for my jacket, but yer they were so posh, too delicate, anyway got the bus home, not too many dramas.
    Got home then went out to tea to the Mussel Bar in Freo, best restaurant ever! then after i got a banana split thing from baskin robins which was soo nice, needed to throw up afterwards though.. now im here practicing yoyo and only 2.5 fingers have falling off due to lack of blood.
    In short had a fun bday and thabks again for the jacket, u spent way too much money on me... cause now i gotta spend that much on you.. :P

  right.. im going cya round like fat penguin"

I was completly numb for the whole day, because of my head cold i had lost part of my hearing so the world was muffled and for some reason i couldn't really feel wind on my face or anything and i woz numb.. weird feeling

   Havent posted in a while while so quick summary... first day of skool was crap broke my bag and my watch at exactly the same time while riding to skool, by the second day i thought its was the weekend already.. not a good feeling.. friday i went to GNR8 and led wit enj, was a bit of fun, i scored tea at his house b4 we went :), then had pizza there which of course me and enj had to eat all of because our guys ordered a pizza none of them liked.. Duh. and made an awesome team hat. That was all good, played Mu most of saturday then got a massive cold sat night, got kicked out of mums house sun arvo, didnt sleep at all sunday night, not like 'i woke up alot and i had no sleep' literally 0 hrs,<---because of the cold, stayed home monday and slept and ended up watching Monsters Inc funiest movie, specially the last bits with the bird and the car... and then today.. nuthing deep and meaningful just a story

"event","Had an awesome nite last night.. decided that with limited holidays left that sleeping was infact a waste of precious holiday time. Firstly i decided to download a 80mg computer game.. and with limited broadband speed of 2.5 kb/sec to download a 81400 kilobyte game you can go figure how long that would take (9.04 hrs incase you couldn't be bothered working it ou ) So i got myself a coffee and settled into my computer chair for the night. At first i was just reading through CAD comics and began to talk in computer langauge to myself.. u know like 1337 n00b pwnage j00.. all that. this brang me up until about 12am-11pm, not really sure, didnt pay atention to time. Talked to ali and enj until 1:07 when she deserted us and so i spent a few hours talking to enj and doing first sketches of my new comic i am making... btw if you guys have any ideas/hint/all of the above it would be much appreciated.. mm so that kept me occupied for a few hours and i decided to deal out some pwnage in cs and then some majow pwnage in commanche completeing close to 8 mission in 2 hours(btw thats good!) so after all that it brang me up to about 4am and i decided to catch a few hrs of sleep while my download finished.. approx. 645am so i got up at 6.45 and downloaded the patch for it which would also take 3 hrs. had some more sleep and got up, drew some more, talked to enj and played some more cs.. now im here.. oh wot an awesome nite.. maybe not for some but i had fun.. and only 3 days left.. but if i dont sleep its closer to 5 so off to reading more comics and drawing more characters and playing more cs..

"event","Well I've been kinda down today not feeling all that great and i couldn't think of a reason why, so I thought about it.
I went to bed last night fairly content and happy and thinking ' Why should people be depressed.. there is no point and mostly its for attention, i mean everyone has problems and you can shoose to accept them and move on or dwell on them and get depressed'
So what i rekon is that God has made me depressed today for no reason in order to put me in their shoes, to experience what they go through, but to a milder extent, and i realised that it isnt as easy as 'Just be Happy, dont be depressed' because its alot harder to come out of it than that. So yeh ive tried to just not dwell on it and move on and it kinda worked but what i realised is that its harder to do it than people think... Now i mite be waayyy off here and yeh i dont think it would hurt me even if i was but yeh i kinda realised something today.. wierd"

Feel kinda weird today.. kinda sad kinda bored all for no reason, buth hey theres no point in being depressed in our life on earth, too little time, why not be happy and have fun. So ill do something to keep my mind of things and be happy. Maybe play some games or something

 Had an awesome day today.. went to freo and had coffee mmm. with ali and just hung around there all day doing random stuff.. buying random clothes.. for her not me, and went to places in freo i never knew existed.. anyhoo had a great time doing nuthing in another place apart from home..

 And about what i said before.. i mean that its alrite to have attention and sympathy coz that makes us feel good and whats wrong with that! so do whatever you want not that anyone actually read that and took it to heart but yeh feeling good is good..

Best go and read Lord Of The Flies.. boring but have to do it and play some comp games ecause i havent done that in a while..

  All two years worth! wo so no life.. hmm the only problem is that i have forgoten the first half of them.. so the only resolution is to read them all again :). This is goin in my memories as the only time that i have sat down and completed something in my whole life.

On another note i have decided that i am trying not putting depressing problems in my journal because all the promote is attention and sympathy which is not a good reaoson for writing your feelings... besides life is alot more happy-like if you concentrate on good stuff. that doesnt mean im not gunna write them. just is going to be the rite motive for writing.. 

ohk well onto another comic. hmm vgcats is an awesome comic also.. only 150 in archive tho.. ah well be dun in a day.. or two.."

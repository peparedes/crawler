These are just a few. I have loads. TONS! I went nuts....from the time I pulled out of my driveway until I pulled back into it. ;-) I had a BLAST! (even getting lost isn't so bad now lol)

I didn't get the best of shots, but I had fun. These really were MUCH better in person. Honest. ;-) I just had to share a few of my first firework photos ever. I found some words to go with them as well.....

I hope everyone had a wonderful Independence Day!

"event","I found this lovely meadow. It went on for some length. I had to find a poem fitting before I could post it. It's just so beautiful. My photo really does it no justice at all. I just wanted to share.

To Meadows
By Robert Herrick
1591-1674 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


YE have been fresh and green, 
         Ye have been fill'd with flowers, 
And ye the walks have been 
         Where maids have spent their hours. 

You have beheld how they 
         With wicker arks did come 
To kiss and bear away 
         The richer cowslips home. 

You've heard them sweetly sing, 
         And seen them in a round: 
Each virgin like a spring, 
         With honeysuckles crown'd. 

But now we see none here 
         Whose silv'ry feet did tread 
And with dishevell'd hair 
         Adorn'd this smoother mead. 

Like unthrifts, having spent 
         Your stock and needy grown, 
You're left here to lament 
         Your poor estates, alone.

"event","Well, I got my new graphic program installed. Yippee!! It's going to be fun trying to teach myself TWO new programs at once. LoL! I'm going to though, or this idea won't go very far. (About as far as that book idea from about 5 years ago, heh =p)

I may get the hang of this 3d thing yet. *grin*
Each page is linked but it's better to use the back button since there is no link back here. Sorry!"

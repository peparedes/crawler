Things are good on my end, working was one of the most fulfilling things I've done since asking Amy to marry me. I was so happy to be there, and actually a little surprised by my own reaction to it. I didn't expect to feel so at peace, so at home when I got in to that ring, and I think all it did was prove my passion for what I do, which will always be wrestling, I think.

Wow, that was a rambling paragraph, wasn't it?

And Amy is distracting me, as she does alot these days. *grins* So I'll leave this here, and with a promise to update again sooner than it took this time.

I miss you guys, on a parting note."

She was so cut up about that, I was kinda cut up myself. Death, man. Who the hell ever thought it would be a learning experience to have to go through death as much as we do?

I love Amy. I'm so in love with Amy, every time I breathe, I breathe her. Every time I open my eyes, it's Amy I see. So I did what I should have done a long time ago, and asked her to marry me. And I fully intend on a wedding, whatever Amy wants, before this year is out.

So yeah, that's what Trish was talking about. Me asking Amy to marry me. I know we've been engaged before, but this time, I think things could be different. It's for real, marriage is on the cards. You know?

To say the criticisms thrown my way over my wrestling career as of late haven't gotten to me a little would be a lie. Yes I'm a little weird, a lot unique, but I have feelings too. Just because I've realised I have a life outside of wrestling doesn't mean I've given up on it or that I'm burnt out.

The book appears to be doing well. Matt and I have had a lot of fun promoting it on the signings. Speaking of, its good to see you back bro, you have been missed.

Ames is the stable force in my life at the moment. I really don't know where she finds the time or energy to keep up with all the things she has going right now.

"event","She's right, I'm just too disorganized to remember most days.  Or I write things down somewhere else and don't bother to put anything up here.

I'll get better Dumas, I promise. *g*

Having house shows off has been nice, since I've gotten to spend more time with Amy than I usually would. It feels a little odd not being there, but you won't catch me turning down a break either. Especially since I got to spend most of it with Amy. 

Even if she does spend most of her time insulting those of us who love her. I swear, Francine is just as abused as I am.  We're going to have our revenge though.  Just as soon as we figure out how to turn the oven on....

I'm thinking maybe we should have challenged her in some area other than the kitchen.  We may be screwed."

"event","Hell, if I were me I'd do the same thing.  Remind me that staying with someone who's cheerful at indecent hours of the morning is a bad idea.

Amy ended up coming back home with me since we hadn't really hung out in a while, and by the time we got to my house she was in no condition to drive.  Not that she agreed with me, of course.  Arguing with that girl is like talking to a brick wall...once she's made up her mind, you're screwed.  I think the only reason I convinced her was cause she was exhausted.  

Anyway, I ended up tagging along to her therapy session yesterday. I know everyone in our business is used to working through injruies, or working to heal them, but still, I don't think I've ever seen anyone push themselves like she does.  I mean, if they expect her to get to point A, she's got it in her head that it won't be good enough until she's past point C.  Sometimes her determination blows me away.

Which reminds me that I have to stop trying to do everything for her, before she snaps and murders me.  *laughs*  Note to self - you are not her mom or her babysitter."

"event","Just thought I'd get over the awkward first entry.  It's cool to see evreyone getting these, especially people I don't get to talk to as much as I'd like.  Hopefully I'll be good about updating, but I'm sure if I'm not that Amy will come after me. *waves*  Computers are not something I spend a lot of time with, but she assures me that the net is full of porn and dancing hamsters, and what more can a guy ask for in life?

Like everyone else, life is really busy for me lately.  I spent most of Thanksgiving thinking about what I had to do after it was over, which isn't how I want to live my life.  But right now it's how I need to live it, and I'm not complaining - I wouldn't give up any of it if I could.  Unlike some of the rumor sites might have you think, I still have a huge amount of passion for what I do, and I think I always will.  I'd like to have more time for music, friends, just doing things around the house, but that's life.  It's a pretty decent one.  

Of course, just because it's fine with me doesn't mean everyone in my life is real thrilled about it.  I don't get to see my brother or Amy half as much as I'd like to.  And after a lot of talking it over, Beth and I decided that whatever we had just wasn't going to work out.  I'm too selfish about doing what I want with my life and she needs someone she can see more than once a week if she's lucky.  

So that's me right now.  Amy and I are going to get together on Monday and since she has no excuse to back out on me, hopefully we'll have a good time. We always do . I don't think I'd realized how much I missed her until we talked last night. 

I'd better wrap this up, before I'm later than I already am - hope everyone had a good weekend."

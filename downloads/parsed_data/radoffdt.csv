"event","So if I wanted to protect the amino groups in my lysines from reacting during my reductive amination, do I go with benzylamine or triphenylmethylamine or something else?

I was looking on this page: http://www.organic-chemistry.org/protectivegroups/amino.shtm and they say that these are both stable enough in water at pH 6-8ish, and that both are stable under reducing conditions--so the reductive amination (w/ NaCNBH3) can happen.  And, it looks like I can use some sort of oxidant (any suggestions?) to remove'em once I'm done.  

Thoughts on which is the best to use?

Here's my schema so far:

(1) protect my protein
(1a) purify protein away from excess protecting group
(2) add the maleimide fluorophore to the thiol on my protein
(3) add the aldehyde on my protein to the amino-support
[maybe I can do both 2 and 3 at the same time]
(4) deprotect my protein (mild oxidizer, maybe?)
(5) purify it away from contaminants."

"event","Hey organic nerds out there,

I've got a doozy of a problem for you.  I have a protein which has an aldehyde, a thiol, and a few amino groups on it.  They're all independent of each other, and don't come in contact w/ one another (meaning they can all be used independently).

I want to use the thiol to label for a fluorescent tag (yes, I know I can get fluorophores that react w/ aldehydes, but for reasons that aren't important, I want to do it where I'm using a thiol-reactive fluorophore).

Also, I want to use the aldehyde group to tether the protein to a support.  

What kind of chemical groups should I be looking for in this support?  Here's my list of qualities I want:
(1) reacts with aldehydes, but not with thiols or amines
(2) is a relatively tight binder, so I'm not worried of the protein coming off the support
(3) is stable in water, so I can actually do my experiment
(4) has a relatively normal pH range stability (preferably between 6 and 8 would be nice)
(5) won't totally fuck up biological compounds, etc.

Any ideas, y'all?  

I was told that maybe I could react it with an amine to make a hydrazine, but I'm scared it's gunna reverse.

There's a paper I'm looking at which says they reacted an aldehyde with biotin hydrazide but I'm not sure which functional group in the whole thing the aldehyde binds to.

I'd appreciate any help you can give.  Thanks!

Edit:  I've looked into this more, and... do any of you know anything about an aldehyde +amine in the presence of NaCNBH3 (sodium cyanoborohydride)? Apparently, after nucleophilic attack by the amine, the carbonyl carbon is reduced to CH2.  Or what about aldehyde + hydrazide to make something I don't know how to name but which has a C=N-N linkage?"

"event","Hey, so here's a question I've got for my research:

Can you think of a chemical/class of chemicals which have the following properties?

(1) Two different forms of linkage to the chemical (For example, two different types of functional groups, or, as in the case of DNA, one functional group and then the other ""form"" is just zippering of the DNA)

(2) Resistant to bending (like a carbon nanotube, if I understand correctly)

(3) Able to be different lengths (or at least have the ""functional groups"" [for lack of a better term] at different distances apart)

Bascially, I need to attach 2 different things to one ""support"" and I don't want the support to bend while I'm doing it.  

Right now, I'm thinking of using a GC rich sequence of DNA which, I hope, won't bend too much... but if I could use a nanotube or something like that, it'd be even better.  They're a lot less flexible.

Any thoughts?"

"event","So, since I last posted, I met w/ my chair again.&nbsp; He told me basically what I already knew: that I had to start emailing labs.&nbsp; 

So I did that.&nbsp; I'm looking mostly in the biology department downtown because (1) chemistry is not my strong suit any more (it's sad to say), (2) chemistry doesn't have people doing biophysics so much, (3) biochemistry uptown only has 2 or 3 professors who interest me.&nbsp; 

Not that most of you know who these people are, but for the few of you who do, I'm looking at either Hunt, Yang, Tong, Sheetz, or Dr. X (a professor whose name I don't know, but apparently he works on the 6th floor of Fairchild and is brand new and works on Chromatin).&nbsp; Do y'all have any suggestions/know anyone who is in these labs whom I can chat with? I'm also looking in biochem at Palmer and maybe Shapiro--and MAYBE in chemistry at Gonzalez (but that's doubtful).&nbsp; 

Also, I'll be downtown tomorrow around lunch time (11am apt w/ Yang; 1:30 w/ Tong--if anyone wants to grab lunch....)

So, that's going as can be hoped, I guess.

In other news, I went to El Mundo (this ghetto-looking clothing store on 134th street &amp; broadway) b/c I heard they had some good deals on clothing.&nbsp; And they do.&nbsp; I got some quality shirts--like Kenneth Cole and BCBG--for $15 each.&nbsp; I got a Diesel Tshirt for $6 which I'm giving away as a present--I couldn't fit into it if I tried...stupid boyfriend being the best cook ever....&nbsp; 

BF and I also made brunch for my friend Nancy and her daughter on Sunday after going out on Saturday night to Red Bamboo (fantastic vegetarian restaurant on W4th and 6th) and then to the Boiler room (crappy gay bar--w/ realllly cheap drinks--$3 wells)&nbsp; 

A friend of the BFs came back from Israel yesterday--and her flight to TX got cancelled b/c of the snow, so she crashed here and made TONS of noise and was a generally rude houseguest.&nbsp; Such is life, I guess.&nbsp; Luckily, she was gone by 7am.&nbsp; 

BF's now at work--he officially got offered the job--so that's great news--and yet he still has no leads on an apartment.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; 

Anyway--today is laundry and cleaning until 5pm when I meet w/ Dr. Hunt downtown.&nbsp; Oh, and reading this awesomely cool NMR book I have."

"event","So I ironed some more yesterday (so far I've done ~64 shirts, and quite a few pairs of pants).

Then, I met a friend for lunch--who works in the lab I used to work in--and I told her all the shit that went down (she was out of the country at the time).&nbsp; 

THEN, I went shopping.&nbsp; First to BB&amp;B, then to B&amp;N.&nbsp; I got TONS of stuff (some things I shouldn't have--but whatever) including a new clock, a new lamp, the complete West Wing series and the complete Homicide: Life on the Streets series...[Hey, it was buy one, get one free, so I figured go for the gold and get two series that are both insanely expensive...for half the price I would've paid]

Dropped the stuff off in my place, rushed down to Times Square to meet the BF for dinner (at the most over-priced Dairy Kosher restaurant in the city), followed by a jaunt in Virgin Megastore.&nbsp; I got a bunch more stuff there including some really GAAAAY movies (Hedwig, Fame, Rent, Y tu mama, et al.) and got the bf some cds he wanted.

Then, Les Mis. The performance wasn't as good as the one I remember seeing on Bway when I was a kid--and it's certainly not as good as the concert cast I have or any of my CDs.&nbsp; That said, some of the performances were amazing--Eponine, Marius, and Javert were all crazy good.&nbsp; However, whoever thought that Daphne Rubin-Vega (Mimi from Rent) as&nbsp; Fantine would be a good idea was smoking CRACK.&nbsp; Fantine has to have this pure, pristine, clear voice.&nbsp; D R-V has a raspy, low, crazy voice.&nbsp; She was great as Mimi; not so as Fantine.

We then trekked up to my place, fell asleep, and got up and showered.

Today, I'm going to Target, meeting the BF for lunch, and then doing some more cleaning, etc.&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; What a fun day I'm going to have."

"event","that this is perhaps a stupid post--especially since I haven't actually posted about my life in MONTHS, but nonetheless, I wanted to comment on something I've noticed lately.<br /><br />When I was younger, I can't recall ever noticing any gays on TV shows I used to watch.&nbsp; Now, granted, I was watching mainly cartoons and sitcoms, I think the first gay character I remember watching on TV was Leon on Roseanne.&nbsp; Home Improvement, Full House, The Cosby Show, Sisters, Picket Fences, (and all the other shows I used to watch as a child) NEVER (as far as I recall) had a gay character. Even The Golden Girls, a fave of every homosexual I know, only mentioned homosexuality in passing--family members/friends were gay, but they appeared only tangentially.&nbsp; <br /><br />Will and Grace, of course, had homosexuals in it--and while I stopped watching it somewhere in the middle, the first few seasons had the homos not having actual relationships/not kissing/holding hands/showing any sort of affection.&nbsp; Queer as Folk was the first introduction I had (on TV, at least) to homosexuality with any sort of realistic perspective (despite the fact that QaF is not at all realistic for me).&nbsp; But, QaF was on Showtime, and I could only watch it by downloading episodes from Limewire (eventually, I did end up buying the first three seasons--and I'll probably get the last two at some point).&nbsp; <br /><br />Bravo did a lot for the gays--Queer Eye, Boy Meets Boy, and a few others kinda-sorta brought gays out of the television closet, but the former makes gays into asexual helpful nancies, but not real people.&nbsp; The latter lasted only a season, and was horrible in that it made the main character try to find the gays among a group of straights.&nbsp; Pleased with the progress Bravo had made, I still longed for gays to be portrayed just as straights were on normal tv shows.<br /><br />I, of course, loved Andrew's coming out on Desperate Housewives (btw, he looks really hot this season)--and I'm IN LOVE with the character of the nephew on Ugly Betty.&nbsp; He's SO adorable.&nbsp; But, it wasn't until last night's Brothers and Sisters that I actually saw something I'd been waiting for...for years.&nbsp; <br /><br />The nerdy/awkward gay lawyer son (who's TOTALLY adorable, btw) and the witness/object of his interest had this really ""normal"" moment--something normally restricted to straight characters on dramas...but it was between two men.&nbsp; And I got all mushy and happy.&nbsp; <br /><br />It signals to me that gays finally are getting some sort of respect/normalcy in the minds of TV producers.<br /><br />Anyway--I really thought I should post on that, as it's something really great I've noticed going on in this world...and it warmed my heart.&nbsp; <br /><br /><b>Edit:</b> Apparently I was <a href=""http://www.afterelton.com/TV/2006/10/gaytv.html"">wrong</a><br /><br />And as for the rest of my life...maybe I'll find time to post on it soon.&nbsp; I dunno."

3 Arrested in Attack on Singer on East Side

By KAREEM FAHIM
Published: June 11, 2006
A Manhattan singer was taunted and beaten early yesterday by a group of young men who shouted anti-gay slurs and then broke his jaw as he walked in the East Village, the police and the singer's publicist said. During the attack, the singer said, no bystanders came to his aid.

The singer, Kevin Aviance, 38, who has recorded a number of popular dance songs, underwent surgery for a broken jaw at Beth Israel Medical Center last night, said his publicist, Len Evans, who said he talked with Mr. Aviance after the beating.

Two 20-year-old men and a 16-year-old boy were arrested in connection with the beating last night. The men, Akino George of Townsend Avenue in the Bronx and Sears Jarell of Newark, and the 16-year-old, who lives within blocks of where the police said the attack took place, were charged with first degree assault as a hate crime, the police said.

According to Mr. Aviance, Mr. Evans said, he was heading to his Chelsea home about 1 a.m. yesterday after leaving Phoenix, a bar on East 13th Street, where he had been relaxing with friends. As he walked on East 14th Street near First Avenue, Mr. Evans said, Mr. Aviance was approached by six or seven young men who shouted anti-gay slurs and threw objects at him, including a spray can that one of them had fished out of a trash bin.

One of the young men punched Mr. Aviance, and the others attacked him.

""They dragged him to the curb,"" said Mr. Evans, adding that Mr. Aviance said that the men threatened to kill him. ""There were pedestrians everywhere. No one helped him.""

The young men stole Mr. Aviance's cellphone, Mr. Evans said. After the singer passed out, some bystanders apparently came to help him, Mr. Evans said.

Mr. Aviance performs in drag but was ""dressed like a boy,"" before the attack, according to Mr. Evans. ""They kept using these words. They said, 'You're not diesel.' He didn't know what that meant.""

Mr. Evans said that the singer had planned to take part in next week's annual Gay Pride parade and festivities. ""He won't be able to perform now that his jaw is wired shut,"" Mr. Evans said.

""Din Da Da,"" Mr. Aviance's infectious remake of a 1980's song, reached the top of the Billboard dance chart in August 1997, and another song, ""Alive,"" was No. 1 on the chart in 2002."

"event","So, I have a friend from college who is now in graduate school.

And she has a friend whom she thinks is gay, and for whom she feels bad because she thinks he's choosing not to come out b/c of conservative parents/Catholic values/whatever...

She asked me what I would do in the situation--and I told her there are two possibilities--(1) be a good friend and let him come to her when he's ready (which, frankly for some of us is very torturous...) or (2) confront him about it and either (a) have him deny it or (b) have him admit it...and I gave her my opinion on what she should do...but she wants more opinions before she does anything, so...

She asked me to ask my gay friends (but you straighties, you can answer too) to think back to before, when they were closeted... (or if you still are, think about now)... what would you have done/what would you do if someone came up to you and asked if you were gay?  Would you deny it? Would you run away? Would you say yes?

I'm being really serious about this...I'm trying to help out my friend so she can figure out the best thing to do for her friend...

So--thoughts? Plz

I am not, however, a professional poker player, nor did the TX House of Reps extend any sort of sympathy to my family when my grandfather died.

I didn't go to Akiba Academy, nor have I run any Triathlons in Germany.

"event","So, I have a new computer--a laptop--MacBook Pro--

and I LOVEs it.  It can do some way cool things--and I'm enjoying finding out all the new stuffs.  

Hillel and I are back together--I think--and although not everything's the same now, we're still very close.  I'm taking more time for myself--and not spending every waking hour with him--in an attempt to (1) give us some space, (2) not build up resentment for not having time to do things that I want to do, and (3) help us appreciate each other more.  

I'm going to my friend Geraldine's play tonight...and he's staying at home to play Apples to Apples w/ a few of his housemates.  While I'd like to be there too, I've decided that it's more important to be with my friend and support her.  And he understands that.  

Lab's going surprisingly well--my boss has been supremely nice to me lately--and things are working.  But, the lab is continually shrinking.  The tech left a few weeks ago; a rotation student a few days later.  The other rotation student's leaving soon, as is a post doc.  One of the other post docs is leaving to go home for a month soon thereafter.  

That will leave the other grad student--and me.  With the boss.  As the only people in the lab.  It's SO lonely!  Sometimes I wish I'd joined a bigger lab just so I'd have someone to talk to...  

Meh.  

In good news, I've discovered a good restaurant up here that has $5 lunch specials--a nice-sized portion of meat, rice, beans, and a salad!  It's expensive in every other respect (a small glass of OJ is $3 and desserts are $6), but the lunch specials are a huge draw...cuz the food's good.  So that's nice."

"event","How do I reconcile my fundamental belief system (that is--what I think is right, not just for me, but for everyone) with my tenets of liberalism (which include: do whatever you want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone)?

I'm going schizophrenic trying to figure out how to marry the two, and I fear I'm leaving Hillel confused, angry, and disappointed.  

I know it sounds cliche, but I grew up thinking one way--and with no one ever to challenge me, I've become extremely set in my ways--Yes, sex is only for a relationship; drugs and smoking are no-nos; drinking should be a rarity; be polite and gracious even when you hate the person you're talking to; make sure others have before you take seconds; etc.  

Should I change those? Should I have to? Is there not someone else out there who believes the same way? Is it worth it to wait it out w/ Hillel and see if I change? I know he's not going to--he made that very clear to me last night.  Am I willing to accept what he says as Truth?  I fully agree that I should have no say over anyone else's body--in principle.  But I'm opposed to drugs--and think that people shouldn't use them.  Isn't there an inherent contradiction there? 

I'm so confused, and I don't know how to fix it.  Maybe it's a sign of growing up that I'll learn to see even more shades of gray than I already do.  I know great people--friends of mine--who've done and who may occasionally *do* drugs.  It doesn't make them bad people...yet I can't help thinking that they're bad.  How do I fix that?

But how can I trust someone who's told me he's quit smoking--and then lights up once I'm not around out of revenge? Can I trust that he'll never do it again? Is it okay with me if he does? Should it be? It *is* his body, and as long as I'm not around, how will I Know? And yet, somehow, no.

I feel so alone on these issues, but I can't shake them.  I fear it's costing me a relationship with a great guy who loves me.  

I've spent the past two days miserable--upset at what he did, and also upset at how I handle my response to him."

"event","but I couldn't just go home with someone I just met.  Why is it so common in the gay world to do just that?

How can I not judge someone who does it? I grew up with Jews (including my parents) echoing the Southern Baptist sentiment that sex isn't something you just throw about willy-nilly.  I have internalized that--and it's hard to get rid of...

So how can I not hold someone who does just that in disdain? I understand others have different points of view--others, including my boyfriend.  I would love to be so open minded--but whenever I hear about someone who just went home with some random guy, I can't help but think: ""whore!""  

How do I reconcile it all...and still stay true to myself? Do I? Should I?"

"event","hillel's in texas until tomorrow--so here's what I've done in his absence:

Lab.  I spent 14 hours on Wednesday, 15.5 hours on Thursday, 8 hours on Friday, and so far 7 hours today in lab.  I'm flailing, however, as my microscopy skills lack severely, and no one's here to help me on the only days I get to be on the microscope--b/c no one comes in on Sundays.  Luckily, I'm on the scope again tomorrow, so I can flail in front of someone next time to show people how shitty it all is.  

Parties.  I went to one on Friday night (at Veronika's apartment--where I had my bday party)...After Shabbat dinner at Hillel's place (which was waffles! yum!) I rode the columbia shuttle uptown, walked to the party, and had fun there.  I made it to bed by 3.  I went to another on Saturday night (at Omar's apartment, in honor of Caitlyn's leaving my lab--to go to graduate school next year) and that was also fun, though I ended up soaked, and I had to spend the entire party in Omar's pajama pants.  At least they matched.

Cleaning.  I am working on cleaning up my disaster of a bedroom--and it's getting there, but it's nowhere near done.  I have so much shit to do.  

Computer.  My computer, which has been dead for a few months, is finally on my priority list.  I've had my old one to get by with, so I haven't *had* to fix it--but, I called my brother, a computer expert, and after trying many different things, and getting various error messages, he told me the only thing to do was wipe the entire thing and start over.  So, I'm transferring all my important files to my old machine and I'm going to be wiping my HD, probably tonight.  Alas poor iMac.

Talking.  I spent a bit of time on the phone--w/ Hillel, of course, but also with Rich, who wants to come for Shabbat dinner on Friday--with one of his exes...which'll be awkward for everyone involved...but whatever.  

Visiting.  I went to Mike's on Tues night after lab to keep him company, watch a movie, and chat.  It's good to see him--and we got to see Camp, which is an excellent film--if you like really kitschy, broadway-influenced teen-themed movies.  It's got good music too.

Sleeping.  Not enough."

"event","last night was drama.  I was not pleased, but as it turns out, a significant portion of it was my fault.  

Sigh...when will I learn to keep my mouth shut?  I didn't even intend to offend; rather, I was making an off the cuff remark.  I said a ""joke,"" if you will, which turned out to be really offensive.  But I didn't notice it, neither was it pointed out to me until today.  

Instead, I left where we were last night because I was being ignored.  And I hate being ignored.  A lot.  It's among my top 10 things I hate (also included are laundry, peppers, mushrooms, and slow people on the subway stairs).  I especially hate being ignored at a place where I don't want to be whatsoever.  And especially where I know no one except for those doing the ignoring.  

But, alas.  The ignoring was occuring because of what I said.  So, I've decided to work on my comments and make sure they're not offensive.  Sometimes, though, it's hard because when it comes to one specific issue, I've got one outlook on life while nearly every other person I've met in the city (except for...um...2 or 3 people I know) has a completely opposite view.  I'm talking 100% opposite view.  And if I may be so bold, I'm including nearly all of you on this LJ.  It's hard for me not to judge, make fun of, chastize, deride, etc. because of my 'moral standpoint.'  I know it's wrong to do those things.

I really try to be open-minded about everything.  For some reason, though, I just CAN'T about this one instance!  Grr.  And it gets me into a lot of trouble...especially with my friends, because they think I'm insulting them personally when I say things like what I said.  And doubly-especially with my boyfriend.  He shares the opposite viewpoint, and when I say things like I said last night, I really offend wonderful people like him.  (*I almost said ""otherwise wonderful people like him.""  I can't get this ""moral voice"" out of my head! HELP!)  

And I'm really starting to piss him off because of it.  And I unwittingly embarrased myself in front of the people we were out with.  And I don't know what else to say.  I'm an asshole when it comes to this issue.  

Is it okay to be an asshole? Can't I just be granted this one little thing to be asshole-ish about?  I suppose not, (especially since I have plenty of other things I'm asshole-ish about too) but I'm having many difficulties working through this particular one.  

Sigh.  Maybe he can forgive me."

"event","there was a girl at the party--she couldn't have been more than 19--freshman in college.  

She got SO wasted off of 6 drinks--fell over twice, couldn't stand up straight, etc.  

Her two friends and I tried to get her to go home, but she wasn't having that b/c she said her roommate would be mad at her...

IT would have been fine had there not been Mr. Sleeze.  

Mr. Sleeze is an Israeli...ex-soldier...rather attractive, in his mid-to-late 20s, and totally hitting on this girl.  Again...were she sober, I'd've stayed out of it, as would her friends have.  As the case was, however, she was too drunk to make any sort of consentual decision--so I made the decision for her--(was that right to do?) that she was not going to go home with this guy.  I totally cock-blocked him the entire night, and even when his hand was on her thigh, I was right next to her, making sure nothing happened.  She didn't want to go home w/ him (I asked her when he got up for a while) and I made sure that that didn't happen.  

Her friends were with her the entire night, and I walked them home (accompanied by H--who was rather drunk himself) and made sure no one got to her between the party and the dorm.  

So--yay--I'm the good samaritan--sure--but what about me? Why is this girl my problem? Why wasn't I off having fun with my boyfriend at a party? 

Sometimes it sucks being the responsible one."

"event","I just got back from an informal discussion held at the Hillel based on the idea of ""revelation"" and what does it mean for Judaism/Jews that the Torah was ""revealed"" to us by G-d.

Had I never met Hillel, I'd've never heard about this thing--but had I heard about it, I never would have gone.  Why not? Because I'm so ignorant/disbelieving when it comes to certain aspects of religion.  I recognize my opinions on religion are not well founded in scholarship, and as such, I really have nothing to contribute in such a discussion--but also--

Well, it just seems to me like it's all a bunch of hooey!  I mean--G-d actually GAVE to us the words of Torah? Written on a lambskin? What? NO!  It's so...Illogical!  G-d to me is not a 'being' who is capable of physically ""handing"" something to people.  Is it just ""divine inspiration?"" Maybe...And yet, I also don't believe that the rabbis who wrote the *rest* of the holy texts (mishnah, gemorrah, etc) were divinely inspired.  I don't think there's a way that ""G-d"" can guide someone's thoughts/ideas so that they can interpret things properly.

Someone brought up how artists often feel divine inspiration when they're composing/painting/etc.  It all seems like such a load of shit to me!  And I feel really bad that I feel that way...I'm too damn cynical for all this religion...No G-D ever guided me when I was pipetting or running a gel...no G-d helped when I was running a PCR or trying to focus the microscope...How can G-d have helped DaVinci paint the Mona Lisa? How can G-d have helped Dvorak write the New World Symophony?  It's so...out of my realm of belief.

And yet, the traditions are great--I love the community feeling and the tunes we sing at prayer--and the time around the Shabbos table when we're all gathered, discussing our weeks, etc.  That is so special to me.  Is that G-d? Sharing a meal with other people? Community?

Sigh.  It's all so awkward for me--I'm the dumb kid at the table--everyone's speaking Hebrew--and I can talk Science.  They're discussing redemption and revelation while I can discuss transcription and translation.  Maybe were I more knowledgeable about all of this religion stuff, I'd believe it more...or maybe if I wanted to believe it more, I'd be more knowlegeable about it."

I feel like I'm constantly disappointing my boss--my experiments don't always work to his standards; I'm not working as hard as he'd like me to; I take time to have a life, and I don't stay so late.  

I am, however, working 5.5 days a week, trying to finish as much of my stuff as possible, while still trying to do my classwork.  I'm so friggin tired most of the time from lab--and then I go home and H and I and a bunch of his housemates have taken to watching the SATC set that I got H for Hanukkah...

The problem is that I fall asleep mid-episode b/c I'm so exhausted...and then I feel bad/embarassed b/c I'm sleeping in front of everyone--and so then I excuse myself to go to bed--but then I feel bad b/c I'm not being included.  

I don't know how to fix it--I'm so tired--yet I want to be friendly with people--

Sigh.

There are times I wish I didn't have such high expectations placed on me so that I could be like a normal person...go to work 9-5, not worry about anything about work after that (or at least not much else)...get paid enough to live on--and have my evenings free to go do fun stuff--like see a movie or go shopping--

I miss having my Sundays free!  I really really miss that.  Once the rotons are out of lab and once summer starts, Shabbat'll be later, and I'll be able to stay in lab on Fridays and I won't have to come in on Sunday to do microscope stuff...I'll really enjoy having the spare time to just chill.  Hillel makes big breakfasts on Sundays for the entire house usually and I miss all of 'em.  People sit around and play games/watch tv/etc.  And instead, I'm in lab.  By myself.  With only the internets and my LJ to talk to.  It's a lonely life and I wish sometimes that I didn't have to be so different...

Alas.  I'll get over it quickly enough, I'm sure..."

"event","Yeah, it's been a while...

What's been up in my life? Hmm... 

H and I are still doing well.  We spend a significant amount of time w/ his (and now my) friend Isaac--who happens to be GORGEOUS (check my facebook friends if you don't believe me) and Isaac's boyfriend Dovid (the Ashkenaz pronunciation of David).  We were there for Shabbat this past weekend--and while it was fun, parts of it were...not.

There were about 12 Jew-mos there...and I'm really getting rather sick and tired of gay boys' over-dramatization of life.  It's too damn much.  Just have a regular meal and relish the opportunity to spend it with nice people.  Stop talking about how ""fabulous"" shit is and PLEASE, please, PLEASE, at the Shabbos table, do NOT discuss your sex life!  I understand that as gays, we all have in common the whole...""sex"" thing, but I mean, shit!  Stop!  I don't want to know what was going on before you got to the dinner.  I don't want to know when you lost your virginity, and I don't care how many people you've been with!  These are PRIVATE things!  I don't go sharing them with the world as if they were fair game!  

But, what I hate most about the gays...(and may I preface this first with: I don't know of the straights--so don't lambaste me for thinking it's only among homos)...

I hate how some gays just assume that relationships don't mean anything and that boyfriends are not really ""boyfriends"" and that monogamy is a farce.  You would not believe how many times H's been hit on...and after he's replied that he has a bf, the guy'll say: so?  Why doesn't this MEAN something to people?  

Friday night, there was a guy...whom I've known for over a year off and on...who put his hand on H's thigh, who massaged his neck, and who asked H not to tell me that he was hitting on H.  I mean, come on!  He fully admits to hitting on my boyfriend...TO my boyfriend...and asks him not to tell me about it.  Needless to say, I shan't be talking to this mofo again.  Grrrr!  My boyfriend is off limits!

[and on a side note, why doesn't it ever happen to me? Why don't guys hit on me like they hit on him? Is it b/c I'm uglier? Is it b/c they know I'd never say okay? Is it b/c I'm too intimidating?... :-p]

I'm in lab...on a Sunday morning...quite early...for a reason.

Tonight, I've got an appointment with two girls to look at a room in their apartment...outside of Columbia housing...$900 or something like that a month ... which is highway robbery, but not TOO much by New York standards...for a 10th floor apartment on 96th and Columbus.  The building has a doorman and an elevator and laundry in the basement and from what I can gather, is probably quite nice. 

So I'll see.

And for those of you who have my IM name--you wanted me to be on IM more so that you could talk to me more...you were upset with me because I'm ""never on IM anymore.""  Well, now I'm on...but I'm still not around.  I don't spend time in front of my computer like I used to.  I'm sorry for that, but I have a life.  I do shit.  I go places.  And I don't live it in front of my computer any more.  If you want to talk to me, call me.  OR email me.  I'm busy, and I don't have time to just dick around on IM.  

I miss all of you though.  I will make time in my schedule to hang out with you if you want.  Each and every one of you is invited to Shabbat Dinner w/ me and Hillel.  You don't even have to bring anything!  A free meal!  with GREAT company!  (not just the two of us--there's tons of ppl who live in his building...and we all eat together)...  Just comment, and I'll give you details!

Less-than-three."

"event","last night H and I went out w/ a few ppl to a comedy-club in the area and then a few of us remained to go to the nearby gay bar for more drinks thereafter.

I remain plagued by a few things of the previos evening--

(1) I got called numerous things (comedians make fun of ppl in the front row--which we were)....which wasn't so bad--but the transsexual host of the evening at the gay bar pointed me out to the whole bar--and said I looked like Bill Gates.  Now, the four of us at the bar were sitting in the WAAAAAY back....and frankly, I didn't think I was too conspicuous.  I don't take that as a compliment either.  I know I shouldn't let what a transsexual says bother me--but it was really not so nice--I thought I kinda looked good last night (I had on a FAB cobalt blue DKNY cashmere sweater on....and all she could say was that I looked like Bill Gates?)

(2) People who keep kosher...don't.  Of the people I was out with at the comedy club last night, all were Jews, but only four of the 8 of us ""keep kosher.""  (Myself not included--I'm perfectly willing to eat cheese/meat/whatever out...just not certain forbidden forms of meat, etc.)  Last night, at the comedy club--I observed three of the four eating Nachos.  At the clearly non-kosher club.  Wtf?  I realize this shouldn't bother me--and that I should be pleased cuz that means there's a chance that maybe I can get these people to go out to a ""NORMAL"" restaurant...and eat with the rest of the world...  But, I mean, come on!  Why say one thing and then not hold to it?

(3) One of the comedians claimed to be Jewish...but then he proceeded to make some of the most offensive Jewish jokes, play on some of the most offensive Jewish stereotypes, and really just annoy the crap out of us (the 8 jews sitting in the front)...  That bothered me a lot--and I felt like I should have booed or something; I just... didn't.

Other than that, not much is going on.  Lab, of course...and classes...and just general turmoil.

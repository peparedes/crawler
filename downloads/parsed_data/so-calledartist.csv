"event","I shaved the skin off my back with a two-edged sword
Your integrity is intact along with your feelings of lonliness
But I promise you it won't hurt a bit, I swear

This story unfolds with a feeling of relief
And yet this morning you awoke with the sweats
The bullets bead off your forehead
And the breaths you take are never caught
The stillness of your room is spinning
And you can't shake the memories
of your innocent remarks still barking
You thought you were so clever

The veil is torn
The echo bounces

""Its not mine"" you shout
""I never thought this through""
Your self-important defiance
You realize what is the truth"

Mostly forgotten parables would fit
Its commonplace to be exacting
Beware of the lacerations opening
Contrary to popular belief
I haven't gone to the great unknown
I just left to find a better footing
And to cast the first stone
Its everywhere this new invention
to capitalize on your feeding frenzy
I made the great mistake of loosening
the binds of greater things to come

Its only for a moment
It'll pass, it'll pass, it'll pass, it'll pass

who made the great mistake of treason

my apathy stretched its greatest
I held out my hand
just to kick you while you're down

Yeah fragile minds would be receptive

This is transcendence

"event","This foreground moves at x times faster than previously recorded.
Studies find that the next evolutionary mark is rapidly cornering us.
In fact we're the next extinct. In fact we're the next sacrifice.
For this aperture disguised as progress I doubt you'll find it soothing.

And the blips move closer

I suggest we retrograde in keeping with the test subject's dilatory pace.
I suggest we contemplate the act of evacuation and leave the wounded
I suggest we apprise all of those who can comprehend auch tung
I suggest a feigned sense of steadiness in a turbulent state.

And it marches closer
As it snarls in rage
And still I wonder
Whose name is to blame?

I am the bane inside your cluttered mind
And I will devour your instinct
To find any reason to hide
You'll run but you won't find solace
Perhaps you'd be better off falling
This curiousity will bend towards deference
And you will become the undoing as well

"event","Something has gone awry in this mediocre something or other
Definite space imbalance to the left side of my equilibrium
Never found the sense that made the brighter bright and the louder loud
Eventually this makes for amusing anecdotes and stifling comebacks
Nevertheless its gone awry

I tripped on the chord
I made my escape somehow
I leveled the field
and I don't know the cost
Of what's left of it
And what matters now
But my phones are all tapped
For the reasons unknown

So I came to the conclusion that its done it to itself somehow
A crazed addiction that spilled the insides of a foul rotting corpse
Whose choice was it that willed over my will to win through a botched game
Even though the keys to greater balances belonged to us as a whole

"event","I have grown ever so relaxed with my life as of late. I want to further my education yet after my brief encounter with a lumbar strain and almost a month's worth of no work AND no school I've grown to really like sitting around doing nothing, sleeping in until I choose to wake, driving around town, doing absolutely nothing.
""What would I do if I had a million dollars? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I would sit around on my couch, watch TV and do nothing."" That's what the guy from Office Space says when asked what he would do with a million dollars. Quite frankly, I agree. I mean of course i would invest it into something. But then I would just live off the interest. I don't need a fancy car or a big house or anything to show off my wealth. I'd probably buy some musical equipment and one of those beds that conform to the shape of your body. You know those beds that are made up of that material developed by NASA. But thats about it.
So back to my topic. ""Why?"" Why do we put ourselves through so much grief and stress over things that in the end we can't take with us? Why all that when all most of us really want to do is to do just enjoy life. Breathe a new day and just be thankful to be alive. Why does fame and fortune matter to some people? To give ourselves purpose? Meaning? Great, you can tell your maker when you're dead ""I was somebody down there. And they'd say ""great, but you're here now. Why should I care?""
I guess it all comes down to this. We're all in this together. My life and me being alive matters. Me doing things to make this world better matters. Me doing things to make this world better affects someone else in a distant land indirectly. And vice-a-versa. And that matters.
So, I guess, I shouldn't feel so content in just sitting around doing nothing. But dammit, I did enjoy it while it lasted."

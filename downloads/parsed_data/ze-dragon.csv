(very strict rules which led to her iphone being confiscated by the staff) But we're sending her a <a href=""http://bit.ly/YRpP"">Peek</a> so hopefully she'll be back to blogging and twittering (via email) with us all soon while she gets better.

The other side of all this is that she's in financial straits and hospitals aren't exactly cheap and neither is rent in Boston, so <span  lj:user='cluegirl' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://cluegirl.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[info - personal] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://cluegirl.dreamwidth.org/'><b>cluegirl</b></a></span> is doing a little fundraiser for her over <a href=""http://cluegirl.livejournal.com/1094622.html"">here</a>.  One question, one tarot card and an explaination for one dollar (or as much as you're willing).  I think I got that right...

And of course all this is going down right when I have plane tickets to leave tomorrow to visit my sister and my niece in Florida for two weeks which is what I've been prepping for after getting back from Azkatraz in San Fran last week.  (Well, there might have been some sleeping and lying on my back in order to kick the cold I came back with and to try and get my back back in alignment. Stil hermiated, still hurts, but I'm loads more functional now then I was.)  So I'm abandoning my roommate to an apartment with four cats (two who desperately miss their mommy; one who is throwing a fit that his mommy is vacationing; and one who will be throwing a fit when his mommy becomes the center of at least three cats attention) and no car since she can't drive mine as it's a stick.

I couldn't fall asleep last night since there was not a single position in the universe that was comfortable.  Not my stomach or my back or one either side even with the whole pillow between the knees thing.  Eventually exhaustion kicked in and I passed out.  Of course this morning I had an appointment with the chiropractor again, but I almost missed it since I hit snooze on my alarm clock one too many times and overslept. :(  Of course I decided afterward since I could actually lay down and sleep, I'd do just that for a couple of hours before I had to get up and do things like eat and go to another appointment which I just got back from.  It was not a fun sort of appointment.

Anyway, I've been meaning to post photographs that I've taken since that's one of my new hobbies that I'm enjoying a lot.  My therapist is pleased with this progress and today suggested that I look into photography classes which I already was, but it's nice to have a bit of confirmation...

Anyway, I have been feeling exhausted and strung out lately and I'm hoping that feeling which is so close to feeling like a panic attack goes away so I can start writing.  On the upside when it comes to writing I think I've made a little headway since I was doing some very entertaining research for my <span  lj:user='snarry_games' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://snarry-games.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/community.png' alt='[info] - community' width='16' height='16' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://snarry-games.dreamwidth.org/'><b>snarry_games</b></a></span> fic by means of watching an amusing half documentary and half reality tv show.

We'll see how it goes. :D  I'm pretty enthralled with this new service and it makes cross-posting so much easier and because I'm lazy (and on a mac, so no semagic for me) the need to crosspost just makes everything harder when it comes to writing posts in the first place. :P

Anyway, I hurt my back again this winter probably when I slipped on the ice and fell on the steps, so I've been going to a chiropractor after it got just that bad.  It's interesting since the last time I had back problems I went the Ortho/Sports med route with lots of PT that I hated. This is easier and is working faster.  He's a nice Russian dude who has a talent to find a topic of conversation that both of us can enjoy during the whole adjustment which is nice because I feel relaxed and comfortable while I'm there and since I hate doctors of all sorts this is a good thing.  Still a little stiff, but it's getting better. :D

Fandom wise, I need to get back into a writing mood.  I don't think it's going to be hard, but at the same time I need to be able to focus in order to write and I've been having massive focus issues for over a year now.  Lots of watching new shows and stuff and the bunnies should be coming, but they aren't.  Part of this not being able to write is why I've gone to knitting and photography as a creative outlet.

I should probably be studying for my exams, but part of me doesn't actually want to.  I'm not too worried about them since neither of these particular teachers are the kind to fail anyone.  So by tomorrow night I have to learn all about tires and shoes and bite marks and how they leave impressions.  I'm even less worried about Anatomy since I've already taken Anatomy two/three times. :D"

Which was the ruling which led to the Daubert standard on how scientific evidence (in federal cases) should be treated during a trial.  On a state level, the courts can use this, and quite a few if not most, do, but a lot also incorporate the old Frye standard into it.  It's to keep the psuedoscience away from court cases... of course this leads to things like fingerprints (which are well established and should usually be allowed in as evidence) <a href=""http://anonym.to/?http://wjz.com/topstories/shooting.evidence.judge.2.431460.html"">being thrown out by a judge</a> since the judge becomes the ""gatekeeper"" of scientific evidence.

I haven't posted here in a long time.  Not really since I came back from FL and then just to post that I was back.

<lj-cut text=""In the time since..."">In the time since I have applied and got a position as a TA in my graduate program, attended an awesome class that Dexter would have apprediated (and probably could have taught), went to Chicago and saw the internet and mets lots of awesome new people, some of whom even friended me (Hi!  Hi there!), packed up all my worldly possession except for a handful of things travelling by car) and watched it all get loaded by the stupidest movers ever into a truck (for a single example of said stupid go <a href=""http://femmequixotic.livejournal.com/396494.html"">here</a> to read about where my soon to be roomie had a run in with them <b>before</b> 8 in the morning.  O.o), had a handful of panic attacks, was accepted into the National Scholars Honor Society (actually this happened a while ago and I never posted about it, but still, it's news, right?), and had an argument with my computer (the harddrive crashed and everything went away (thank god for googledocs).  I think the computer won).

Oh and dealt with the sulkiest cat EVER.  For serious.  <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ze_dragon/pic/0001b0b9/"">See.</a>  He's so very unhappy about all the packing that has been happening lately.  And now he Does. Not. Approve. of everything being taken away.

It's been a busy month apparently.</lj-cut>

Right.  So... What else?  I should say something for all the new people on my flist.  I'm a twenty something that will be living on the Green Line in Boston (starting next week) while studying for my Master's Degree in Biomedical Forensics (Yeah, that's like that CSI show except totally not...).  I used to write a whole lot, now I write a little, but not anything since last year really due to circumstances beyond my control, but I've been working on some stories which I didn't lose in the harddrive crash of doom last week, thank god.

One last thing.  I've probably posted to my forensics filter more than any other filter since that's where a lot of my focus tends to be.  I've also had a handful of people friend me since I've created it (wow, it's going to be a year soon).  So anyone who wants on, let me know and I'll add you.  Warning, though, it can get a bit gruesome.  Also let me know if you want off."

School (aren't you surprised?) which was my witness advocacy class or ""how to be an expert witness 101"" which was interesting, and I think I did all right in besides totally getting more nervous than ever before when taking the stand for my final.

Then we've had days where it's so hot and humid I have to remind myself that I don't live in Florida anymore because if I did, it'd be like ALL THE TIME OMG!  And then I am happy that I am in Boston and not FL.  Though I am expecting an excursion to Orlando before the end of the month, so that is all kinds of happy.  Seriously, never thought I'd be saying that I'm excited to be going to FL, but dude, Disney World, but more importantly my SISSY who I am missing something fierce lately.  I've not seen here when there hasn't been a funeral involved in just shy of a YEAR.  So Sissy and Tea totally make up for humid disgusting weather.  As does the PotC ride, and a whole load of other stuff that I've not done in a couple of years.

Fandom and writing wise... well, I've some stuff on the table.  I'm still plugging away on my sweet_charity fic, and I've got another fic that I'm trying to work on, and another one that if I can just squeeze out 2k more words I'll totally be finished maybe... those are all HP.

It's just a general malaise that's been bothering me for months.

Overall, I'm tired and ready for the semester to end.  I finally caught up with my school assignments that I missed.  (mostly it was just one class, but it was enough to drive me crazy for a couple of weeks during that whole batshit insane family issue).

Wolfram looks over Yuuri's shoulder as he opens the door.  ""You must be joking.""  His voice is light, but incredulous at the same time and Yuuri is about to say something, something blistering and perfect in retaliation, but it's not necessary because Wolfram moves forward into the apartment past him and trips over the genkan, barely catching himself in time.

""Be careful!  Geeze Wolfram.  It's like my mother's; you have to take off your shoes before you enter.""  Yuuri manages to toe off his shoes and climb over Wolfram who is still sprawled on the floor to make it inside of the apartment.

Wolfram pushes himself up into a sitting position on the edge of the genkan and takes off his shoes.  ""This is nothing like your mother's house, Yuuri.""

Shrugging, Yuuri watches as Wolfram pulls off his jacket, hanging it on the rack near the door.  He rolls the sleeves of his crisp white shirt up to his elbows.

""The whole place is the size of your bedroom at your mother's.""

""It's not that small.  The bedrooms are behind that wall."" Yuuri says, waving toward the traditional screen doors to his left.

Wolfram almost looks disappointed, Yuuri thinks when his fiance walks up to him.  ""It is too that small.""

""I think it's sort of neat.""  Yuuri crosses his arms and sticks his bottom lip out.  ""I mean, I've heard about traditional houses, but spending so much time in America when Shori and I were little made my mother fall in love with Western style houses.  I've never lived in a traditional Japanese style house."" 

He's not looking at Yuuri as he inspects the apartment, sliding open the door to one bedroom and sticking his head inside the room.  ""It's empty.  This is what your 'salary' as Maou goes toward?""

Giving up, Yuuri kneels by the wall.  If he goes to sit under the kotatsu he'll never want to move again.  ""The Great Sage's as well, and it's only part of it.  Besides, it's not a salary so much as an export business.  We bring over unique goods from Shin Makoku for the Earth Mazoku and the Earth Maou buys them off of us.  We use that money to keep up this apartment.  Murata also uses some more of it to pay for university, and I...""

Wolfram looks suspicious.  ""You what?  You aren't buying gifts for women here, are you?!""

Laughing, Yuuri leans forward to grab Wolfram's wrist.  ""No.  Mostly I just buy manga and baseball cards.  Come here.""

Yuuri does not think that it's cute when Wolfram pouts.  ""There's no where to sit, Yuuri.""  Except it sort of is.

He tugs on Wolfram's wrist again until the blond gives in and kneels in front of him.  Wolfram's pulse jumps under Yuuri's fingers, a staccato beat that's now familiar and warm to him.  ""It's not that bad sitting on the floor.""

""It's bizarre,"" Wolfram says, and Yuuri can feel each word as he leans forward to press their lips together.  The kiss is smooth and comfortable and their lips slide against each other.  It's like curling up in the library with Wolfram pressed into his side as they read or soaking in the tub until their fingers wrinkle and the water turns cold.  It's like all those things, but not, because the kiss has an edge of desperation at its corners clawing to come forward and consume them.

Fingers dig into Yuuri's shoulders, too hard to be a caress and Yuuri knows that he'll have bruises when he tries to look at them tomorrow, but he doesn't care.  He lets Wolfram push him back until his head cracks against the wall.  The sound distracts Wolfram enough that Yuuri can push him back in turn and Wolfram is so surprised that he ends up sprawled out across the tatami mats, blinking up at Yuuri in confusion.

""I've missed you, Wolfram,"" Yuuri whispers as he leans down over Wolfram.  ""Your brother makes me work too much.""

Wolfram's lips turn up in a smile and he reaches out to pull Yuuri back against him.  ""Is this why you brought me to this closet?""  He's close enough that the words brush the the hair near Yuuri's ears, and Yuuri shivers.  Instead of answering, he leans down and presses open-mouth kisses against the pulse in Wolfram's neck, sucking and licking until Wolfram is squirming under him and biting down on his bottom lip to keep from moaning.

Hands grab the edge of his shirt and yank it up and Yuuri finds himself tangled in the stretchy material.  He has to stop what he's doing to pull the shirt the rest of the way off and throw it across the room.  When he looks down, Wolfram's eyes are mostly closed and only a sliver of green is visible beneath dark blond lashes.  Wolfram's tongue darts out, drawing Yuuri's attention to his kiss bruised and swollen lips.

""Here,"" Wolfram breathes.  He reaches his fingers up and runs them along the edge of Yuuri's jaw until he can slide them through Yuuri's hair and force him down for another comfortable messy kiss. 

""Fuck!"" Yuuri gasps as Wolfram drags his teeth along Yuuri's bottom lip, and jerking, he grinds his hips down. Wolfram is hard and Yuuri wants, oh how he wants, to feel the slide of Wolfram's cock in his hand.  Wolfram's fingers aren't stopping though.  They move down his neck and over his ribs until they slip past the edge of Yuuri's jeans and slide all the way to the front.  Yuuri can feel the goosebumps rise along the path that Wolfram's fingers take, and when whey actually brush against his cock, Yuuri sighs.

""God, you're hard,"" Wolfram says, but the words are lost somewhere in the space between them because Yuuri can only hear the blood rushing past his ears.  His jeans are being pushed down around his hips, and Wolfram slides feet up until he can push the denim material down around Yuuri's ankles.  They've learned economy in their movements, quickly undressing when they've snatched moments.

It's an urgency, a sense of <i>now</i> that's taken over.  Now now now now. Desperate to come, to be consumed, and used, harshly or delicately, it doesn't matter.  Yuuri's fingers move to the top button of Wolfram's trousers.  They're both gasping for each breath, and their messy kiss has deteriorated into barely shared breathing.  Wolfram's fingers come up and slide past Yuuri's slick lips and Yuuri tries to focus on sucking on them, sliding his tongue across and between the digits as they press against the back of his throat.  It's almost like sucking Wolfram off, but it's not and Yuuri wishes that his lips were stretched around the head of Wolfram's cock instead.

He moans, his hips jerking forward again when Wolfram pushes him off, struggling out of the pants that Yuuri finally managed to get loose.  Pulling his fingers out of Yuuri's mouth, Wolfram presses them to Yuuri's entrance, pushing his middle finger in up to the second knuckle.  A grunt and sharp exhalation of breath follows as Wolfram's finger then fingers move slowly in and then out over and over. 

Yuuri winces, the spit already drying and he grabs Wolfram's other hand and sucks on those fingers giving Wolfram the chance to switch hands.  ""You've got to do better than that,"" Wolfram grunts, and Yuuri reaches out with one arm out to try and grab the small squeeze bottle of baby oil on the kotatsu trying to not think of <i>why</i> Murata had left it there.  He's stretching as far as he can and when his fingers graze the oil, Wolfram twists the fingers in his ass.  ""Fuck, Wolfram!""  His voice breaks and he clutches the bottle in his hand.

The gasping break in his voice betrays the calm that Wolfram is trying to show.  ""That's what we're trying for, wimp.""  He grins, lopsided and beautiful, and Yuuri brushes damp locks of hair out of Wolfram's eyes before he overturns the bottle squeezing at least half the contents over Wolfram's fingers.

It's always beautiful watching Wolfram slide his fingers over his length, the fingers dragging his foreskin down over his head exposing the glistening tip so different from Yuuri's cock.  His fingers fist in the shirt that they never managed to get Wolfram out of, wrinkling the fabric.  Wolfram's hand is on Yuuri's hip, guiding him and Yuuri sinks down, stretching around Wolfram as he enters him.  It's just past the edge of painful; he's grinding his teeth, pleading with his eyes for Wolfram to do something.

""Yuuri,"" Wolfram's voice cracks.  ""Yuuri,"" he says again, and he lifts his hips up off the tatami mat pushing in, slowly, and his gaze locks with Yuuri's.

He wants to say something.  To curse or gasp, but his tongue sits heavy in his mouth and all Yuuri can do is lift himself up off Wolfram's cock before Wolfram is pushing up and using his hand on Yuuri's hip to guide him back down, hard.  His breath rushes out and he's cursing, as they slide into a practiced rhythm, Yuuri rocking and Wolfram thrusting up.  Wolfram's fingers dig into the skin of his hip, pressing hard against the bone.

Yuuri's hand reaches for his cock and strokes down his shaft and he looks down at Wolfram.  His shirt has twisted most of the way up his chest, one dusky nipple visible surrounded by pale, white skin.  He bites down on the guttural scream that wants to escape from his throat and the bitter tang of blood bursts across his tongue.  Their movements are harsher and louder and slicker and <i>oh fuck</i>, ""Wolfram!""

He comes sticky and wet over his chest and Wolfram smiles slamming up into him faster and harder, and Yuuri swears that Wolfram's nails are going to leave deep red scratches across his hips and back, and Wolfram comes, Yuuri's name falling from his lips over and over in a mantra as he drags in huge breaths as if he hadn't been able to breathe since they got to the apartment.

Yuuri thinks that maybe neither of them had."

"event","So my LJ extra icon feature went away and I promised myself that I wouldn't buy extra icon space.  *sigh*  I had to get rid of half my icons.  It was very very sad.  :(

Thankfully I have all the icons I really love already uploaded over here.  I didn't think that it would be as bad as it was or that I actively used as many icons as do.  Actively being a relative term because I'm not that active when it comes to journaling.  *sheepish grin*

So lately I've been having thoughts about the writing process and my writing process specifically and what makes me want to write and when I hit a point when writing a fic that I just give up.  I spent a good portion of dinner tonight talking with <lj user=""femmequixotic""> about it, and I sort of want to write a post about it and how googledocs has saved me when I didn't think that I'd ever actually like googledocs.

Suffice it to say that I've been writing <i>a lot</i> lately.  My <lj comm=""snarry_games""> fic is progressing nicely in that I'm working on structuring it just right for the type of fic it is.  I have another Snarry percolating in the background for <lj user=""accioslash""> who won me in the sweet charity auction.  And a couple kyou kara maou fics that I've been working on off and on.  I totally had ulterior motives for pulling <lj user=""femmequixotic""> into the fandom.  I'm so glad my plotting worked!

Also, <lj comm=""snarry_games""> wise, I've completely recovered from the confusion of being a dragon on team phoenix.  Team Phoenix FTW!"

There's not much time left for bidding on sweet charity and I thought that I'd pimp it out before it ended.  It's for a good cause helping those affected by the writer's strike.  So click on the link.  If you were wondering what exactly I'm offering, it's this:

So everyone on my flist should know already that while on occasion I do write short, it's not something that is readily suspected of me, so I am offering one medium to long (8000 to 20000 most likely) Harry Potter fic.  
I'm only offering to write Harry/Snape, Harry/Draco, or Ron/Draco, however.  You can check out the rest of my offer and other offers <a href=""http://www.sweet-charity.net/index.php?set=for_sale"">here</a>.

"event","So, I've been watching insane amounts of anime lately.  This happens every so often and once in a while I will write fic that then hides away on my harddrive for ages and usually never sees the light of day.

So today, I was in a writing mood and decided to open up a fic that I haven't worked on in forever that is actually rather close to being finished.  Unfortunately it is not an HP fic.  Nor is it a bandom fic.  It's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyo_Kara_Maoh"">Kyo Kara Maoh!</a> fic.  This is actually an anime that I love for it's source material.  It is pure CRACK!  Wonderful, interesting crack.  It doesn't pretend to be serious or anything like that.  It's just fun.  And it has awesome main characters that basically slash themselves.  And did i mention that there is built in kidfic?  I have a soft spot for kidfic...

So, yeah, I've been trying to finish up a fic that I started forever ago and having quite a bit of fun doing it.  :D

(And if there is anyone on my flist that might know where I can find some awesome Yuuri/Wolfram fic I wouldn't mind a link or ten :P )

In other fannish news, I tossed my hat into the <lj comm=""snarry_games""> lottery.  *crosses fingers*.

Title: It's all about the BS
Pairing: Brian Schechter/Steven Smith
Rating: PG, maybe PG-13
Disclaimer:  Yeah, this never happened... and probably won't happen since it takes place in the not so distant future...
Summary:  Nanny or manny... kidfic
Notes:  I hope that you like it, miss p!  Happy Birthday!

<lj-cut text=""Steven, for his part, tries to keep from laughing, but he fails.  Miserably."">

""What?"" Brian asks when Steven walks into the room and stops dead in his tracks.  ""It comes with the job.""

Steven, for his part, tries to keep from laughing, but he fails.  Miserably.  Clutching the edge of the closest chair, he bends over and laughs as hard as he can until he's gasping for breath and coughing.  He turns back to Brian.  ""Don't tell me that they can't afford babysitters because I won't believe you.  If I had a kid, I could afford a babysitter, but I don't.  Should I invest in one?""

Brian glares and wipes Christmas Star Way's mouth with a damp cloth for the millionth time.  ""You.""  He points his finger at Christmas and she reaches out to try and grab it.  ""Don't take after either your father or your uncle.  You can, however, take after your mother.  She I can handle.""  He bends down and glances at Steven over Chrissy's head before looking at her again.  ""And whatever you do, don't take after Steven.  One loud mouth VJ is all I can handle.""

""And you handle him very well.""  Steven laughs again.  ""For serious, you're telling me that you get to play nanny in the green room to a runt while the boys get to be interviewed by none other than the awesome and amazing yours truly.  That's bad luck, man.  This is why I don't manage a band.""

""The actual nanny is sick.""  Brian stands up and cracks his back.  He's getting too old for this.  ""You would have given your left nut to manage My Chem.  Admit it.""

Rubbing his chin, Steven makes his way over to the playpen someone had set up.  ""My left?  I was thinking my right.  Or maybe neither.  My eyes.  I would have given my <i>eyes</i>.""

""Yeah, well, you can't have them.""  Brain ruffles the littlest Way's hair.  She's calmed down since Steven came in the room.  She must be a fan.  In a few years she'll be chasing after him.  If he doesn't manage to blow up the Fuse studios first.  There had been some odd rumors about Christmas tree lights and pyrotechnics back in July.  Oh, and one couldn't forget the canceled Untitled episode called <i>Steven's Bodacious Christmas in July Spectacular!</i>  Brian doesn't ask; he figures it's for the best.

""Well, we can hop in a train and head down to good old Massachusetts and get hitched.  Then what's yours is mine, but not necessarily the other way around.""

""Yeah, sure.""  Brian looks at the door.  ""So if you're here that must mean the boys are finished and I am free from babysitting the sprog.""

""They're doing the autograph thing.  Been awhile since My Chemical Romance has been to the Fuse.  Lots of new people.""

Brian sighs.

""Though I think Gerard ducked out to go find the nearest Starbucks.""

""Do you want to go and find Uncle Jiggy, Chrissy?""  Brian's voice is pitched higher than usual, but the only witness is Steven and if he has a problem with it, Steven can blow him.  Bending over for what he hopes is the last time that day, Brian picks her up and settles her on his hip.  Pulling her fingers out of her mouth with a sticky, wet pop, she reaches out and presses them against the Riot Squad tattoo on Brian's neck.  Brian groans.  Squeezing his eyes shut, he tries not to think about baby slobber caking on his neck.

""That looks nasty, dude.  How old is she?""  Steven grabs the tiny hat and coat from the table and puts them on her while Brian holds her still. 

Or as still as he was able to hold a squirming Way child.  Brian would have hated to see Gerard at this age.

""Almost six months, I think.  Not nearly old enough.""

""Fudgecicle.  I sense touring issues.""

Brain nodded and headed toward the door.  ""Lead the way to coffee, man.  Maybe the smell will make the child sleep.  God knows how much her father and uncle drink.""

<center>***</center>

Gerard is standing outside of the Starbucks with a latte in one hand and a cigarette in the other. 

Snatching the cigarette, Brian hands over the kid.  ""Your niece.  Have fun.""  He takes a long drag and savors the taste of the nicotine.  It does his addicted soul good.  ""Fuck, in the future we're hiring a babysitter when the nanny is sick and Alicia is doing Alicia things.""

""You owe the swear jar a nickel, Bri.""  Gerard is smiling though as he pushes his nose against Chrissy's.  ""How's my fairy princess?  We need to get you a tiara and a magic wand.""

""No wand.  The kid will hit everyone with it.""  Brian rummages through his pockets.  Reciepts, lighter, a scrap of paper with a phone number he's supposed to call on it, a flash drive and gloves, but no cash.   There is no way he's putting a cup of joe on his debit card.  That's just pushing it.  He glances over at Steven.  Who has vanished.  Asshole.  ""Goddamnit!""

""Can you say that Uncle Bri Bri needs to put a dime in the swear jar, Chrissy?""

""You keep up with the Uncle Bri Bri shit, Gee, and I'll stuff you in the swear jar.  You abandoned me with a kid!""

""Chrissy says that you need to put twenty cents in the jar.""  Gee grins.  ""Besides, she's not my kid to abandon with you.  She's my fairy princess niece.""

""At least she'll have Bob as a masculine influence.""  Steven reappears next to him and smirks, pushing a cup of coffee into Brian's hand.  Brian knew there was a reason that Steven was his favorite VJ in existence.

""Fuck you,"" Gerard says, but he's laughing.

""That's a nickel for the swear jar, Uncle Jiggy.""  Brian laughs too (it's contagious after all) and sips his coffee.

<center>***</center>

""Every time I see you there is a tiny Way nearby.  Why is that?""

Steven sits down on the floor next to Brian.  They're in the green room at Fuse studios again.  This time the boys are going to be performing on the new live show that Brian can't remember the name of.  Shows are short lived at the Fuse.  Sort of like a teenagers attention span.  The only one that lasts is Steven's Untitled.  Well, that and Pants Off, Dance Off, but anything that's basically a striptease doesn't count.  It's just there to stimulate the baser natures.  Not that Brian has ever watched it.

""Well, this time it's because Alicia is helping to tech and the nanny was fired.  They're big boys.  They don't need me watching their every move.""

""I wouldn't be so sure about that.""  Steven grins.  It probably means trouble.  ""So far Frank has knocked over a amp while practicing, and then he kicked it.""  Steven pauses.  ""I'm not really sure why.  He was laughing at the time, but yeah, he kicked it and now he's limping around and trying to trip Ray or Gerard.  Spread the pain around I suppose.  He keeps muttering about adversity under his breath.""

""Fuck it.""  Brian stands up with Chrissy tucked under one arm giggling.

""One,"" Steven chuckles, ""I don't think that's a condoned way for carrying a kid, and two, isn't it a better idea to go with Fudgcicle in front of the kidlet?  Less money in the swear jar means more money left to me in your Will.""

Brian rolls his eyes and hands Chrissy over to Steven.  ""Fine.  You can demonstrate proper child handling techniques for all while I go and kill my rhythm guitarist.  And the only thing you're getting in my Will is my Wii.""

""Sweet! Don't forget to tell Gee you owe him a nickel for the swear jar!""

Brian flicks him off.  Gee and his fucking swear jar.  Steven and his fucking smile.

<center>***</center>

""All children should be named after holidays.""  Steven hands Brian a cup of non-alcoholic nog.  ""I just spent the better part of an hour extolling the virtues of naming the first Iero-Nester sprog Easter Egg to Jamia.""

""If you tell me that Frank thinks that's a good idea, I'm going to kick your ass.""

""I think he's leaning toward April Shaolin or something.  Which is equally as brilliant.""

Brian chokes.  ""I'm going to kick everyone's asses.  Stop giving them bad ideas.""

""Bad ideas equal good TV.""  Steven smiles.  ""Not that I worry about good TV.  All I need are good bands.  The sweet sounds of music stir my soul.""

Brian rolls his eyes.  ""The nauseating sound of your voice turns my stomach.""

""You don't mind it when the littlest Way is lurking in your vicinity.""

Brian shrugs and shifts and ends up closer to Steven then he means to.  ""Chrissy likes the sound of your voice.  I think Mikey watches the Untitled with her.  He likes your interviews.""

""And don't forget Rock History 101.  The most brilliant segment of the show.  I had Mikey in once for that segment.  We expanded it to half a show on the Smiths and Morrissey.  That kid knows his shit.""

Brian nods.

""Hey, I'm sure you're not, but I was wondering.""  Steven shifts from one foot to the other.

""About?""

""There's this new group and they're stuck in a basement but the music is sweet.""

""And you're friends with one of the band and thought that maybe I could check 'em out?""

""Well, no.  I don't know any of them, actually, but yeah, I thought that maybe we could go and check 'em out.  Not as a label man, dude.  As just dudes.""

There's a cough behind them and Brian and Steven turn as one to see Mikey, Alicia, and Christmas.  ""I think,"" Mikey starts, ""that Steven just asked you out on a date, Bri.""  He laughs.  ""Oh my God, I need to go tell Gee right now!  He's gonna be jealous.""

""I want to see the look of his face.""  Alicia holds out Chrissy.  ""Can you please take her for a minute, Brian.  If I don't hurry, I'll miss it!""

Without thinking, Brian takes Chrissy.  He's always taking Chrissy.  Well, at least her parents don't forget her.  It's an improvement to the absent-minded Way family.

""You, uh, didn't answer.""

""What?""  Brian looks from Chrissy's fingers (firmly placed in her mouth and accompanied by loud sucking noises) to Steven.  ""About?""

""The show.""  He coughs.

Brian thinks that he prefers the always joking and never nervous Steven.  This one is a little too, well, not Steven Smith.

""Depends.  Is it actually a date?""

Steven opens his mouth to answer, but Brian cuts him off.  ""Actually.  Yeah, I'll go.  But you've got to promise to be on your worst behavior.""

Steven laughs.  Chrissy pops the fingers out of her mouth so she can laugh too.  Of course this means that her fingers go straight to the riot squad tattoo again.  Chrissy, Brian already knows, is gross.

<center>***</center>

""Well?""

Brain has tried all night to shut off the manager portion of his brain and just enjoy the music.  That's not to say that he isn't enjoying the music, it's just that he can feel that those boys on stage have potential.  He wouldn't give his left (or right for that matter) nut to manage them but he could help them make something of their music and with the right manager they could fly.

His fingers are tapping on the side of his plastic cup, the beat heavy and pulsing.  The riff is incredible, and again, Brian catches himself wondering what would happen if he gave that guitarist over to someone like Ray.

""Hey, you there, man?""  Steven's fingers brush the back of Brian's neck and he starts.

""Wha?  Oh, yeah.  Right here.  I haven't gone anywhere.""

""See, I told you they were that good.""  Steven tugs on his ear.  ""I've got my ear to ground, dawg.""

Brian can't help it, he laughs.  He always laughs when Steven tell his horrible jokes or acts like a buffoon.  He knows it's all an act, but it is a genuinely good intentioned act.  Steven is a goofball of the best variety.

""If I could offer you even half the salary that you make at Fuse, I'd try to lure you away to be an A&R guy for my label.""

The sound Steven makes can only be called a snort.  ""If less then half of my salary at Fuse is all you could squeeze out of your company, then I think I should offer to be a talent scout for free because that's just weak, man.""

""Hey, it's Indie and it's doing all right for a company that's still in training pants.""  Brain glares.  His finger doesn't stop tapping out the beat though.

""Back to kiddies are you?  There are kid references even in your metaphors.""

""Fuck off.""

""That'll be a nickel-""

Brian leans up and kisses Steven.  He figures it's the only sure fire way to shut him up.  What Brian doesn't expect is for Steven to kiss him back."

My father passed away early Wednesday morning.  I'm at that point where I don't even know.  I think the hardest part is being so far away from everything it seems like i'm removed from it all.

I'm over at <lj user=""femmequixotic"">'s who has been so wonderful about being there for me and keeping me from falling apart.  It is such a relief to have a shoulder to cry on, for realz.  And <lj user=""luciamad""> is over for Supernatural night and has been for a while because there is SO MUCH SNOW and we have been telling funny stories.  They are so AWESOME and have been keeping me from being super sad.

So, besides school I've been writing on my <lj comm=""merry_smutmas""> fic whenever I get a chance.  I'm pretty sure that I'm about halfway done and the next few scenes are percolating in my head.  I like it.  It's different.  I haven't written anything like it before.  And that's all that anyone is going to find out about it except for my beta.  *evil laugh*

Of course that only means something to the people that remember I used to write fanfiction a long time ago.  *sighs*  I have not been a writerly person in a long time.  I've missed it, but other things totally took priority.

I'm enjoying Boston and don't know how I tolerated living in Florida as long as I did.  The place was killing me in a way that's just hard to explain.  I'm just happy that I'm not there anymore even if it did mean leaving my family behind."

So, keeping to the subject, I promised <lj user=""aubrem""> that when classes started I would post about them, however, I think I'm going to post about them to a filter only since a lot of these classes talk about real cases and can get pretty gruesome.  I'm a biomedical forensics major after all.  And since I haven't gotten a paid/perm account over at IJ, the poll will be hosted at LJ... you don't have to be on my LJ flist to vote on it since I know that I picked up new people over at IJ...

Anyway, be aware that I might not add you to the filter right away.  I really want to have a sense of the people that I'm posting about this stuff to.

WARNING:  Because, yes, this topic does need a warning.  I might be posting about some gruesome stuff, and if that's not your cuppa, then please bypass this filter.  Also the words ""But that's not how they do it on CSI"" are banned from any of those filter posts because really RL vs. Drama TV, people.  (Doesn't mean I'm not up to the occasional discussion of differences, but seriously...)

Ok, so if you haven't been turned off by all of that, tell me if you're interested.

Getting into a new fandom is always super scary, I think...

So if you suddenly see me on your f-of list, that's probably why.

As for my thoughts on LJ versus IJ...

This journal is probably going to be more bandslash orientated.  I'll still be cross posting my other stuff for the HP people that are staying (for the time being), and there will still be a tiny bit of RL stuff on here and stuff about being in grad school, but I think I'll only be posting bandom stuff here.

Overall though, I don't post much and I don't know if that's going to be changing now that I've changed my environs.  *shrugs*

-look for and find an apartment
-sign up for smutmas
-get roped into moderating some new communities...
-move my stuff into storage
-destroy my car (and get it put in the shop for the next week and a half)
-pester femme
-write a few thousand words of fic

Not necessarily in that order.  All in all I think I've been more productive than normal.  :P"

And the amount of electronics I use in my day to day life is a little scary, I decided.  Between the three of us (me, sissy, and Tea) we've taken up every available outlet in the room and then some.

it looks like IJ is the way to go, so I'm on both.  I haven't done anything with either of those yet though... because see first sentence.  moving has been my life for the last month or so.

Yeah... the next time I'll sign in I'll probably be approx 1500 miles from where I am right now.  :P"

More of a reflection.  I've just spent the day working through stuff that I've accumulated through 26 years.  There were awards from elementary school that I had in my closet...

I'm a little depressed actually.

Kinda weird that in a couple of weeks I'm going to be getting in a truck with all my worldly possessions and leaving Florida behind.  Kinda weird and kinda sad.  Even though I totally know that this is the right thing for me to do."

Boston last week for <lj user=""femmequixotic""> was AWESOME.  I have some pictures... like 3, but they are all on the camera and not my computer because I am of the lazy.

I've been writing on my super overdue snarry games fic, and I have just finished the last scene, so tomorrow I will be reading it over and sending it off to beta.  All almost 20,000 words of it.  That was... painful in lots of ways to write.

I was really pumped to start writing it, but so much shit happened literally the day I started writing it that... it was a painful journey in many ways.  The story is painful and my life while I was writing it was painful...

Anyway, a lot of things are going on in my life.  Some bad and horrible and scary and some awesome and good.  I'm in a weird scary place to be in right now, but if I can make it through the next approximately 100 days, I will be in a much much better place all around.  Physically, mentally, in every way imaginable.

I know this post probably isn't making much sense, but I needed to get this all out.  So I am."

My Chemical Romance has a very pretty lead singer.

<lj-cut text=""Picspam that is all all all Femme's fault, damnit.  The bitch."">

His name is Gerard.

Gerard says hi.

He's in a band with some other very pretty boys.

They are (clockwise) Mikey, Ray, Bob, Frank, and Gerard.  That is what they look like now.

This is what they looked like a few months ago.  Time is told by Gerard's hair.

This was at the very beginning of MCR.  See the hair?

He let it grow out.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v57/DragonLight/gerard%20picspam/my-chemical-romance-13.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket"">
For YEARS.

He cut it for the Ghost of You Video and kept it at a nice messy shaggy shortish kinda length for a while.

Then he chopped most of that off and bleached it for The Black Parade.

But that wasn't really him, so he dyed it back to black.

Gerard doesn't really like people talking about his hair, so we'll leave it at that.

There are so many other interesting things about Gerard...

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v57/DragonLight/gerard%20picspam/GerardandTongue.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket"">
His tongue, for example.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v57/DragonLight/gerard%20picspam/normal_GerardWay14.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket"">
His vampiric tendencies.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v57/DragonLight/gerard%20picspam/faggotgm8.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket"">
The things that he writes on himself.

How delicious he looks after a performance.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v57/DragonLight/gerard%20picspam/normal_05_7E34.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket"">
The make-up.

Though I think some of you may prefer to hear about the undying love Frank has for him and his brother Mikey.  Yeah, his brother is in the band too.

On a real level though, Life has decided to beat me back down.  I hadn't actually thought that things were going to get better, but I was finally starting to think that maybe things just couldn't get worse, you know?  I don't want to complain, but I think that I've been through a lot the last few years... apparently things can get worse and worse and worse.

Any energy I had is now gone, sucked out of me.  Things keep going wrong and I don't know why.  I guess it's just the way things are.

i don't want to go into details.  I don't want to talk about it anymore.  I just... I don't know.

To everyone who gave me condolences for my cat, Thank you.  I just haven't been up to answering comments at all lately, sorry.  *hugs the flist*"

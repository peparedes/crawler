"event","Ha! You all thought i forgot about htis thing the next day didn't you? I tricked you! Haha! Today there wasn't really anything to do but sit at Amanda's and talk about how much we wanted to get stoned. Then i went home and decided that i got to stoned... I smoked with my sister andshe's got the biggest fucking bowl i have ever laid my eyes on, It was but a beautiful blessing to be able to smoke out of something that beautiful. But i feel bad because Amanda didn't get to smoke most likely.... We were trying to scrape our bowls to get a big ball of resin but our pipes were all.... Not resinated and stuff.... It was not most triumphant like most of me and Mandy Candy's days... Today was more desperate then any other day that we've needed to smoke... And because i am stoned i am going on and on about it aren't i? I told myself i wasn't going to but it turns out that i don't believe me or something like that. Now i am being amazed at the fact that i can type without looking while i'm stoned and i feel accomplished, HA HA HA! Wow, I need to learn how to shut the fuck up sometimes because i just keep fucking going huh? It's like the fucking energizer bunny... In other news i haven't talked to Dennis in 2 days because his stupid phones not working so i couldn't shut up about that today either and it drives me nuts when i'm out with my friends and i can't stop talking about my boyfriend... I miss him... Ilove im so much.... Why are we not together right now and stoned?! I miss him so much and i'm fo high... I wan't to steal my sister's car in the dead of night and go see him but i'd have to go in the middle of the night... lIke at 12 or something and he'd have to buzz me in and that'd be bad to do at 12:30 in the mroning... His mom don't like me too much anyway.... Why must he be so amazing and gorgeous? Blah... This is depressing me and i thought i'd be in a good mood when i did this... Blah.... I think i'm done here."

"event","Heyeveryone! I am back from outter space and i am better then ever... Or i might be lying ds o it doesn't really matter. What matters is that i forget about this journal thing like it's nobody's business... Okay, so... Apart from my drug infested weekend and fucked up heating and all that jazz, i think i'm recovering quite nicely for all of those who give a damn.I't time for you all to indulge in my amazing I.CP Lyrics as i describe my mood and my favorite fuck song!
:
""This is a Channel 7 news breif because the news is happening now.""
""Hello, Morque Perkins reporting. Our top story tonight, police and
investigators are still trying to figure out how and why somebody
stole 4 dead bodies from the Wayne County morgue late Monday night.
Police say, the apparent body theif entered through the basement
window, but how he alluded the security and alarm system is still a
mystery. But what we at Channel 7 are wondering, what kind of sick
fuck would steal 4 dead bodies anyway? Details at 11.""

[Violent J]
Dead bodies, dead bodies all over the street
Fifty-five, sixty-five bodies at least
I hang with the stiffs till the break of dawn
I'm always finding bodies when I'm mowing the lawn
Drag em in the house, throw em in the oven
Wicked clown lovin that dead body gloven
Tastes like chicken finger lickin deep fried
I ate a dead body, but don't tell, I lied
I just ate my first dead body last week
Still gots the finger nail caught in my teeth
Before you start yelling and cursing my name
Remember something's wrong with my brain, insane
Second I was born, doctor threw me 'gainst the wall
Kicked open the door and he whipped me down the hall
I'm sliding and I'm bouncing off shit like a hockey puck
And my mother's like ""What the fuck?!""
He said I was born of an alien race
Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face
But I'm not a martian, you wouldn't understand
I'm just the dead body man

""We got bodies, dead bodies
We got fat ones, skinny ones
Males, females, hermaphrodites
We got somebodies, we got nobodies
Bodies, bodies, bodies, woo!""

[Violent J]
Dead bodies, dead bodies in the back of my van
All the little kiddies love the dead body man
I drive through my neighborhood ringing my bell
Some people run cuz they don't like the smell
Others line up just as quick as they can
To try and catch a glimpse of the dead body man
It's all good, if you can stand the funk, but ah
Just don't look in the trunk
I drive down Central kickin the bass
Chillin with my freaks and I'm picked her face
Maggots and bugs like to crawl on her head
Cuz my bitch is dead, I'd rather that instead
Than a ho you can't trust, always diggin a nut
A dead body bitch learns to keep her mouth shut
Riding in the back is my dead body crew
Only they can never think of nothing to do
If you think I'm sick take a look at yourself
You got dead deer heads up on your shelf
On your key chain is a little baby rabbit's hand
I'm just the dead body man

""We also collect dead bodies
So, if you know any dead people
Or you yourself are planning on dying soon
We'll be happy to come to your house
And pay cash for it
We appreciate good healthy stiff
For our dinner
Woohoo!""

[Chorus (1x)]
Call me the dead body man (some one give em to me)
Call me the dead body man (just sell em to me)
Call me the dead body man (you can mail em to me)
Call me the dead body man (br-bring em to me)
Call me the dead body man (won't ya give em to me)
Call me the dead body man (just sell em to me)
Call me the dead body man (just mail em to me)
Call me the dead body man (br-bring em to me)
Call me the dead body man (you can give em to me)
Call me the dead body man (you can sell em to me)
Call me the dead body man (won't ya mail em to me)
Call me the dead body man (you can bring em to me)
Call me the dead body man, call me the dead body man
Do you not see why i am in love with them? Who the fuck could sing a song like that and get away with it that wasn't on Psychopathic records? I'll tell you who, No one!

Hey, what's up, I'm new in town
I work for the circus, Shaggy the Clown
Anyway, ole girl, I seen you around
I guess I'm trying to say that I wanna be down, hey
We had ice cream, sat in the park
I walked her all the way home when it got dark
She took me inside and when the door shut
Next thing ya know I had my nuts in her butt, hey


I wanna bitch whose down to fuck right away
And even does my homies if it's okay
A little bitch that's down for a quicky
I love chicky chicky, I ain't being picky though
So you might be a little bit fat
You might even stink a bit, I don't mind that
Even if you don't fuck on the first date
Just put my nuts in your mouth and I'll stay


I need a girl who just don't give a fuck
So, I'm caught strokin' her mom, I mean, so what
A little skins here and there, ain't nothing
I just need a bitch whose down with a lil somthin somthin


Hey baby, I heard you like to freak
Then come out to play with me


My name's Violent J, so I can't fuck around
Who's the dirtiest bitch in the whole town
There she go, she workin' at Dairy Queen
Bitch couldn't be a day over fifteen
So I do her in the butt like that
I hit it so quick, I made her butt-cheeks clap, haha
Why wait around till she gets married
Cuz I'm ready as long as the neden's hairy


Tootsie-tootsie pumpkin pie
Looks like ya got nut in your eye
My fault, I didn't notice, you was still there
Now go and wash that shit out your hair, bitch
I need a girl not afraid to bone
Even if her mommas and pops is still home
And if her daddy suddenly walks in
He just might see me my nuts on his daughter's chin


Everybody in the hood says that you're easy
You look a little cracked out, a little sleasy
You're a basehead, baby, you ain't shit
I'm still down if you down for a lil somthin somthin
A lil somthin somthin




Bitch let me hit, I won't be long
As soon as I nut, I'm gone"

"event","Did y'all miss me? Well, the past couple of days have been really messed up. My dad started to pick me up on Fridays.... So Saturday i didn't do anything and Dennis came over. I love him soooooooo much! Sunday we went to Church with Coreen cuz it was easter. Dennis came to my dad's at 9:30 on Sunday morning and woke me up and he gave me a kiss and he was like"" I love you, I got you something"" and he gave me flowers and it was so cute! Sunday coreen decided to be a bitch and tell my dad the she fucking hated his family (Me and my cousins) and ""screw you're family""... She's so dumb... Monday i don't remember what i did, Tuesday my Mandy Candy came over, and yeterday i helped my sister move her stuff.... Marcie decided she was gonna have sex with Dave and get him arrested... It's in Tuesday's edition of The Patriot Ledger. 22-year-old Rockland man alledgidly had sex with a 14-year-old girl. For those of you who have heard of the case, She set the whole thing up and she was gonna do it to my boyfriend. Like Dennis would ever in his life touch that creepy thing. I flipped out on her and told her i wished she got pregnant cuz now Dave could be facing years while she's just grounded. That's a story that goes into detail for those who know me, though. MANDY CANDY I'LL SAVE YOU! Don't worry, You'll see R.J this weekend. Much love to y'all and to Marcie, You're lucky Dave asked me not to touch til court's over."

"event","You're running through the woods while someone is calling your name. You run and you run and you never find them. They keep calling you and eventually you have been runnning for hours. You keep hearing the voice and eventually you give up and run out of the woods. Then it hits you. You haven't even been runnning, In fact you haven't even left the spot. You get so confused and you give up and go home. While you're walking home there's a glove. Just an ordinary glove so you decide it's a good idea to step on it. It grabs your shoe and won't let go. You scream and try to kick it off of you. You can't get it off. Once someone says they don't know what you're talking about, The glove goes back o it's original place as if it hadn't moved at all. What the fuck?! You're in the library listening ot headphones and you hear someone call you again. You start to walk through the isles of the shelves looking for them. You continuasly hear, "" Down here, no over here, down further,"" so you continue to go. Finally you hear, ""Look to the left, stupid!"" No one's there. Who's fucking with you? Your mind. This would be a typical day in the life of me and yesterday was the most stressed out day of my life. Also the funnest... I've never wanted to be in the woods so much when i was under the influence. I love it. So, Me and Amanda went to Victoria's yesterday and it was really good. I thought i was gonna be late for work and it turns out i didn't even have to go. So left with out reason to Amanda's came home and slept. I think i slept... I couldn't tell... It was all weird and stuff like half asleep and half awake with drugs still in my system. I don't know what went on for the rest of the day but i remember talking to Laura. I don't know where else to go with this so.... peace...."

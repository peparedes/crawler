"event","I'm playing FFXII right now and addicted about 18 hours in I think...

I was playing Okami and got about halfway through and then Bully came out and I've barely scratched the surface on that one.  Those 2 games are just going to have to wait until Christmas when my PS2 and I will be going to Montana.  Oh yea did I mention Gears of War is dropping in a couple of days.  So many games what's a girl to do?!  I should also be borrowing a copy of Viva Pinata which comes out the same day as Gears.  Look for me on Xbox Live when Gears is out I'll have activated my gold account, my name is Nanohana now since I couldn't get AtariGirl back.  

I'm still working a lot as we try to get our game ready for release next year.  I'm riding the bus 3 hours a day still with my PSP and DS.  Maybe I'll have a car soon, riding the bus 3 hours a day to work was probably not a wise decision, since I barely have any time leftover outside of work, the bus, and sleeping.  

Also I'm going to see Kool Keith as Dr. Octagon on Thursday.  After buying the tickets I heard from a co-worker that has seen him twice that he raps directly over his studio tracks which is apparently worse than lip synching.  I hope this isn't true, but what else to expect from a producer!  After hearing that I wish I would have thought about this more and was going to see Del tha Funkee Homosapien on Wednesday night instead :(.  I clearly wasn't thinking except that the Kool Keith concert was cheaper and at a more convenient location."

My game addiction has been pretty crazy lately. 

I played through We <3 Katamari a few weeks ago and beat Shadow of the Colossus last weekend.  Currently though I'm addicted to Dragon Quest 8 and I love it.  I think I've spent about 20 hours on it since I got it about a week and a half ago.  Old school RPG loving.  Playing it at times reminds me of my childhood where I spent every weekend alone with my best friend Super Nintendo.  Also I'm nearly done with Psychonauts which I've already spent about 12 hours on :O (I heard that game was supposed to be short), I started that a couple months ago though.  Psychonauts has such an awesome story line and art style. 

Yargh I also started Fable: The Lost Chapters, which I think would be more exciting and enjoyable if I didn't already know what was going to happen (I played Fable all the way through.)  

I've also been playing my DS on the bus again.  I got pretty hooked on Mario Kart DS, but after putting in all the effort to get one star or higher in all the missions and then having nothing happen (get unlocked) I'm not playing as much.  Although I still have to beat 150cc and so on.  I'm still playing Trauma Center and Lost in Blue a bit too and I think I may want to return to Advance Wars: DS at some point.  

I still have a lot of other games I need to play.  I haven't even broken in my Neogeo Pocket Color yet.  I'll find the time at some point.  But Animal Crossing DS is coming out pretty soon.  Also as usual I have Ninja Gaiden Black wanting to be played as well as a few other games.  

Really I don't think my game addiction is so bad. I purchase on average 2 games a month.  (I did purchase 12 games last month but 10 of them were very cheap and for the NGPC) I mostly just play on the bus or on the weekends.  I do feel like at least 75% of what I talk about now is game related.  But I think it's acceptable because I make games for a living."

I have wanted one for about 6 years now and I finally got one now that I have money and was persuaded by my internet buddy Esco!!!  The box was unopened and had an EBGames price tag of $74.99 fixed to it.    

I also attended the Video Games Live concert on Saturday which was excellent.  The Orchestra and Choir that performed were the group that did all the recordings for the HALO games.  Some of my favorite songs that they played in addition to HALO were the Metal Gear Solid theme music and the Super Mario Brothers Medley.  The retro game medley was great I felt emotional seeing games like Donkey Kong and Gauntlet up on the giant screen that was above the orchestra while also hearing the music.

"event","I'm away from the internet so much for work and life that I can barely keep up with my LJ friend's list.  I'm trying though. 

Being an adult is still new to me.  Two weeks completed of work so far where I work full time and I'm paid for all the time I spent working and treated with respect.  It's crazy and weekends and free time mean a lot more to me now.  Overall I'm enjoying this.  I don't think I've been happier.  But still this growing up thing is crazy.  Last week I was dreading Monday, but then Monday came around and I was at work and really enjoying myself.  Work has been really challenging and frustrating on some days but this is definitely the best job I've had.  So we all have to grow up and act responsibly at some point right?  

Anyway I just wish I had more time to play video games.  I don't need more games although there are too many I want, I just need more time.  Luckily I'm close to beating We <3 Katamari and Psychonauts.  I started Lost in Blue, Ninja Gaiden Black, and Trauma Center this week.  I play DS on my long bus rides to and from work, I also read.  I finished the book Wicked by Gregory Maguire 2 weeks ago and last week I started Neuromancer by William Gibson, which I most likely will finish reading this week.  Neuromancer is awesome.  

Also this weekend I went to some Nintendogs thing at the mall where I ran into some friends and went to dinner with them.  We got free Nintendogs shirts that have a pink paw print and say Puppy love, (what's this a free geek shirt that isn't too big?) somehow it fits me as it's a fitted shirt for females.  Square Enix had a booth with kids pink shirts with a blue slime on it but they ran out before I filled out some stupid card that had nothing to do with Square enix to get one.  Grr it wouldn't have fit but those little kids don't know what a slime is, I was playing Dragon Warrior before they were even born!  Anyway they had tiny plush blue and silver slimes that have a screen cleaner on their bottom surface so I strapped one on to my DS carrying case.  My friend was there and he was angry about not getting a shirt so he took about 10+ of them.  I picked up 4 lol, the kid working the booth was a tool anyway."

"event","I was in Target the other day and they sell Jones Soda in cans (Jones in a can is exclusive to Target.)  Last year Jones had a seasonal Turkey and Gravy soda for Thanksgiving.  Well this year they came up with some Limited Edition Halloween Sodas.  4 packs of 8 oz. cans for $1.49 so I got 2 of the weird flavors.  Candy Corn and Caramel Apple Soda!  Uggh, sounded horrible but I was curious.  I also checked the sugar content and each 8 ounce can has about the same amount of sugar as a regular 12 ounce can of soda.  I also saw 2 normal sounding flavors:  Scare'berry and Lime and some kind of lemonade I believe.    

Candy Corn Soda - it tasted like a mixture of those cheap banana popsicles and cream soda together.  Not as disgusting as I would have thought, but still not as good as regular soda and far too sweet.

Caramel Apple Soda - I was really hoping this would be good.  Overall it tastes like caramel and apple cider.  The caramel flavor is just too sweet though it also has a really really horrible after taste.  Uggh.


I forgot to look for BooBerry cereal when I was at Target.  I think I'm slowly losing my sweet tooth though.  Off Topic:  I start work tomorrow yay!"

Sadly University just started in Montana so the only friend that I got to hang out with was SUPER who I only saw 2 times ;_;.  I will return soon hopefully!  

I ate too much food in Montana because my family is obsessed with food.  I also turned 23 while I was there, on September 4th which was also Misfit's and boxer Balrog from Street Fighter's birthday.  I got an Electric Blue DS to replace the one I had to return to an old roommate of mine.  I also received Advance Wars DS which is totally hot and ate up 25 hours of time I should have been hanging out with friends and family or enjoying the outdoors.  Oh and Splits got me Psychonauts for my birthday!

"event","Summary of my PAX 2005:
-Went to PAX on saturday

-Felt angry and let down - Got upset that Bang the Machine was replaced by a different movie called ""The Gamers"" which is apparently about some people playing a game of Dungeons and Dragons >:(

-Felt even more angry - Got disgusted at the sight of other nerds, especially a guy wearing a Naruto headband over one eye like Kakashi, he wasn't even cosplaying just trying to look cool.  HAHAHA if I remember correctly this guy wasn't even covering the correct eye.  

-Felt regret - found out a lot of my old schoolmates are working at an awesome video game company on a really sweet game

-Excitement - the Nintendo booth was incredible with playable Zelda: Twilight Princess, Batallion Wars (GC Advance Wars game), Fire Emblem, and Mario Baseball and Soccer (So cute yargh! and I don't even really like baseball.)  Playable DS games: Mario Kart DS, Viewtiful Joe, some awesome Sonic the hedgehog game, Castlevania, there were more but I was most excited about seeing these ones.  

-Interesting - tried linking up my Japanese Nintendogs with a US copy, it doesn't work.  I said I was sad because I wanted to link up with other DS's and this random guy spider told me not to say that too loudly because tons of depraved nerds would get the wrong idea.  This guy also threw up the devil horns hand signal when I mentioned playing old Sonic the Hedgehog on the gamegear back in the day.  

-Fun - Played Diceland in the tabletop gaming room knowing that it was a rare chance to play Table top nerd games without being judged.  Haha also played the demo version of the Penny Arcade Card game uggh, but once again you can play these games at PAX without getting judged for it.    

-Boring and cool at the same - went to a breaking into the industry panel but I'd been to so many I had heard all the info before so I pictochatted on the DS the entire time and ended up running into someone I know that way so we hung out for a couple hours

-Whoops - the 9.5 hours I spent at PAX I only consumed 2 bottles of Bawls drink and 2 samples of SnoBawls (totally awesome  it's like a Bawls slurpee) But when I'm surrounded by games I don't care about food.  Strange considering my large appetite.  (Not a hambeast lol)  

-Excitement and regret - saw a radio show doing a video game jeopardy thing, they were looking for a girl who knows a lot about video games to participate but I didn't volunteer fast enough so they got another guy.  ;_; I was so sad because I knew the answer to the majority of the questions.  And the 3 participants got Alien Hominid games and figures, logitech keyboards and mices, and art books and other games.  I did answer one question on the air though that none of the contestants knew the answer to so I got a prize token and the host hit me in the glasses with it so he exclaimed ""Oh my god I almost broke a girl!""  One of the cameramen for the PAX DVD gave me his prize token too, probably just because I'm a girl.  But hey that sure was nice of him.  But I missed out on showing those guys what was up (with general game trivia) and it would have been so much fun plus more prizes to take home would have been hot.  I am somewhat getting over it now because I already have a comfortable PC laser mouse, a keyboard that works, already have a copy of Alien Hominid and got one of the art books the contestants won anyway.  I ended up getting an Onimusha 3 strategy guide and Art book combo and one of those stupid console skins for my XBox which I put on my XBox already it's maroonish/greyish and covered in spiders LOL.  I should have asked the guy (he was just randomly picking out the prizes for people) for one of his copies of burnout 3 but hey that's like the 4th time that day when I should have spoken up but didn't.  I'm waaaayyyy to quiet and shy which makes me sad.  

-FREE STUFF GET = SUPER EXCITEMENT!!! (well worth the $20 I spent on admission)
+Nintendo Baseball cap (I don't usually wear hats and looks frumpy on my head but I don't care because I'm a fangirl) 
+Blue Nintendo LED Flashlight (like the bat signal but the Nintendo Logo) 
+Nvidia shirt that's ugly and too big (had to fill out a survey about my video card for it)
+Hideous bright green Nvidia bracelet 
+Pirates of the burning sea T-Shirt that says ""Support Piracy"" (the other choice was a shirt that said getting booty since 1720 or some date like that)  Had to beat a mission in the game demo which took about 20 minutes to get the shirt
+Plastic Pirate flag from the same place =D
+2 gamecloud shirts that were being thrown in the air at the Jeopardy thing.  They threw so many shirts that even I caught one, another was given to me by a friend who caught 4 shirts.  These shirts are size L and made of a really soft material and a nice green color.  AND IT ALMOST FITS ME sort of.  WOW.  Unlike the Nvidia and Pirates shirts which like most free game shirts are Fatty sized and would never fit me (maybe as a hideous dress.)          
+Random game demos and City of Heroes and Sly Cooper comic books

I watched some Comic book trivia as well but it was hard to hear the questions and it would have been a curse to win any of the prizes.  Lineage II, City of Heroes, City of Villians.  I don't need to pick up an MMORPG addiction plus I hate monthly fees.  I only knew the answer to one question anyway which was name 2 relatives of Sandman.  

All in all I had another positive PAX experience but I spent most of it alone.  I could only attend for a limited amount of time because of other commitments that weekend.  Which means I couldn't go to the 2 concerts.  I guess I feel like I didn't geek out/hang out with people enough.  And I didn't have time for any of the tournaments which are free with admission.  But I feel better about the weekend now that I've typed this up.  Again I learned the lesson that I need to speak up more.  


<lj-cut text=""Started writing this originally but it turned into a rant so i made the other list"">
This year I decided to attend PAX again.  The event was Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (only 2 days last year) but I decided only to attend on Saturday as I didn't have time and money to attend more than one day.  I didn't see the appeal of paying for more than one day anyway since I wasn't doing any of the tournaments, one day is enough for the exhibition room, and as fun as it would be to hang out with strangers and play tons of games I didn't want to pay for that.    

I got into PAX at about 11:30 am after riding the bus for 80 minutes and paid the $20 to get in on Saturday as I didn't preregister.  I headed down to the theater and exhibition room area.  They really expanded the convention space since last year and had about twice as many people attend.  First I looked at the theater schedule to find out that Bang The Machine had been replaced by another movie called The Gamers.  That was pretty upsetting as I've been really curious about BTM since it was first announced back in what 2001?  I forget, and I have no idea why BTM was replaced. 

So I head to the exhibition room which was quite incredible this year.  Nintendo had a decent sized area it was awesome.  After getting excited about their playable versions of Mario Kart DS, Viewtiful Joe DS, and Castlevania DS I planned on coming back to that booth in a bit.  I decided to check out the whole room initially so I would know where to spend my limited time.  

As I was wandering around I was of course looking at the other people that were in attendance.  Last year it felt like half of the people there were wearing various Mario Mushrooms shirts and there was about 1 girl for every 100 guys there.  I felt like the ratio of girls this year was higher, higher than 1% anyway.  I made it a point not to a wear an obvious nerd shirt this year.  I thought wearing my Hadouken shirt might have been cool but it was not clean.  I felt disgusted by various nerd archetypes that I saw in attendance.  Especially female ones, for some reason I felt disgusted and angry at the thought/sight of nerds (and I definitely can't deny that I'm super nerdy.)  I think what really sparked my anger was the fact that there was a 100+ person line just to BUY Penny Arcade merchandise.  Haha one shirt that really angered me  was a think geek one a girl was wearing that said ""Roses are (it had the HTML code for a shade of red), Violets are (once again HTML code)..."" I looked away then but I just now found out the rest of that shirt reads ""all my base are belong to you.""  I don't have anything against nerdy shirts because I obviously own some myself.  At least everyone learned and I didn't see 1500 Mario mushroom shirts being worn in the same day.  

Other clothing items that were making me hate nerds that day were the girls decked out in hot topic goth style.  I don't directly have anything against goths...but hot topic goth yargh.  I don't even like labeling people.  But these people were making me angry, but what can you expect from a geek con.  The worst was hot topic cookie cutter goths wearing Naruto Headbands.  The guy that made me the most angry was a guy wearing a Naruto headband covering one of his eyes like Kakashi.  He wasn't cosplaying he was just wearing it to look cool.  I'm assuming this guy had 2 perfectly good eyes, and here he is at a gaming convention in the video game exhibition room covering up one of his eyes just so he can look cool.  What a waste, I wanted to punch him in the face.

After all these years it still sounds like I'm a Nintendo Fangirl although I don't think that's the case.  I love all the current consoles (maybe not equally.)  

I have:
21 Gamecube games
20 PS2 games
and 4 Xbox games

But considering how much more time I've spent on the Gamecube and all my fond memories of weekends spent with the SNES and Maniac Mansion and Dragon Warrior on the NES and how much I love Nintendo DS I clearly love Nintendo more.  Then again I have some fond memories from a year ago of testing Xbox games at Volt, but that doesn't really stand up to a lifetime of memories built around Nintendo.   
  

Anyhow...I beat Resident Evil 4 this morning with way too many saves and continues, it took me 20 hours this go around but now that I can do another round in the game I think I may have to play through again.  It'll go a lot faster with my knowledge of the game and more powerful weapons and more health."

Then I put it next to the salad on a plate and ate my sald with Ginger Soy dressing that I purchased on my previous visit to Costco a month before.  It was great and the food was an awesome deal.

"event","Short version:  It was awesome overall.  Can't wait for next year.  Owned hard in Diceland then got 8th in Halo with 21 kills.I got out halfway through the Omegathon.  Starred out of 4th place in Mario Kart by 5th place two kart lengths from the finish line.  Talked to tons of people.  Wish I would have gotten more free stuff.  

<lj-cut>
PAX Day 1:

I got my sister to drop me off, it was amazing driving up.  Amazing how many geeks were out there with geek shirts, amazing how many females weren't outside.  I bet there was 100 males for every female out there that day.  I hung out near the entrance knowing I wouldn't make it in by the time the first event of the Omegathon was supposed to start.  So I hung out around at the front, next thing I know some guys are talking to me and I hear this line ""So are you going to say you came with us then?""  I tell them that I'm in the Omegathon actually and they tell me they let Omeganauts in like 30 minutes ago.  I dash inside to escape those nerds.  

I immediately start talking to the 2 other girls in the Omegathon and they were awesome.  All the Omeganauts head down to the tabletop gaming room.  A lot of them had never played Diceland before,   luckily I had read the strategies for every Army and Dice in the Deep White Sea version of the game.  I also played the game twice before.  We get a quick lesson and I participate in the practice game, I get my favorite army JAX/Maroon.  I own hard in the practice game.  We go to our randomly selected groups I draw the Jax/Maroon army again!  I own hard again.  

After awhile I head over to the Soul Calibur 2 tourney.  All the tourney's are running late and are overrun with contestants after hearing 30 pools with 12 people or so in each I finally get called in Pool 31.  I go over there and we have to share our game with TV 1 :( So we sit around waiting.  My first competitor doesn't show up so I play my 2nd competitor.  It's Nightmare vs. Nightmare and I know my Nightmare skills only play him at 25% of his potential.  I beat my opponent twice he plays Nightmare both times.  He gets pissed and walks out of the tournament cursing and angry.  Victory!  I then get cheaped out by a guy who says he's a n00b and sucks at the game.  He picked Raphael and beat 3 of us in a row that way :(.  I wait around to see him get owned hard by Assassin, I feel satisfied.  

I go to Subway to get food and then return to the console room in time for Omegathon Rounds  2 and 3.  First HALO I sit in between Tony who says he's played HALO once in the past year and Skully who tells me he hates xbox.  I play as my old HALO name Big Pimpin.  The 16 person match is played on Hang 'Em High slayer pro to 50 kills.  I get 8th place with 21 kills and 17 deaths.        
I just happen to be sitting by Tony so instead of doing random pairings for Mario Kart you get stuck with whoever you were sitting next to.  He tells me he's never touched a gamecube in his life!  So I try to teach him the controls for backseat driving in Mario Kart Double Dash, he asks some of the other guys sitting next to us also.       

Tycho calls for a practice round of Mario Kart because he yells ""Some people have never played what could easily be the best game EVER!""  It's on Daisy Cruiser or whatever the level is.  My team gets 1st due to someone throwing a bomb right in front of the finish line blowing everyone up then we drive into victory.  We cheer and high five but it's only the practice round sadly.    
I yell WHAT! when I see that it's Daisy Cruiser again!  Anyway... Tycho's account of what happened is different than mine... and he posted it on the front page of Penny Arcade as his favorite Omegathon  memory before the final round.  I believe my team was in 3rd the first 2 laps, then at the beginning of the third lap 4th place knocks us into the water.  We make it out and still manage to be in 4th place.  THEN!!!!!  2 karts away from the finish line, I almost think we're about to make it across.  5th place gets the star and stars my team out :(  STARRED OUT right in front of the finish line.  We still cross the line and then I pat my teammate on the shoulder and I say ""Well it's ok I think we still did pretty good.""  Mario Kart and DOOM were the games I was going to feel the least bad about getting out in, although I don't think I'm too bad at Mario Kart.  Oh yea someone kept getting lightning also during the race...that was annoying as hell.  I think at least I don't have to worry about Day 2 of the Omegathon now.  

I hang out with another one of the Omeganauts we go to Lanwerx and play DDR and Guilty Gear Isuka.  We get challenged in Isuka by a couple of guys who start going crazy on the arcade cab that's linked to ours.  It's hard to see what's going on because I'm red Jam and my teammate is Red I-no and he's in a fight right in front of mine with someone else.  Also I suck with a joystick.  Anyway Isuka is going to be awesome once I play it more. 

Other people I hung out with on Day 1: Svetlana another one of the Omeganauts, she's awesome.  Played more Diceland with other Omeganauts Kevin and Tony and some guy named Scamp from Oregon.  Chatted with a husband/wife HALO team in line for a free useless Nvidia shirt.  Guys in my Soul  Calibur II pool.  Guys in the Soul Calibur group next to mine, here's where I first hear the infamous trying to keep a conversation going with a girl line ""So do you like Penny Arcade then?""  Various other people I don't quite remember.  

Day 2:

I first attend the breaking into the industry panel, it was hilarious.  Then I go to check out the DDR round of the Omegathon.  At this point it was down to 8 Omeganauts out of 20.  I thought a lot of Omeganauts said they were good at DDR.  Watching this round saddened me as I knew I could beat every one of them except one guy.  That's ok though, they also ran it completely wrong and instead of going by score on the same song for everyone just faced you against someone else who was standing next to you.  Again not randomly picked.

On the first day the theater was impossible to get into as it only had room for 500 and 3000 people were at PAX.  This was the second day and Omeganauts got front row seats to everything.  I head to Penny Arcade Q&A hilarious again!  I also meet Rick Powers from Planet Gamecube and an Associate Producer from Nintendo who invites me to the Nintendo Employee Store.    

I wander around for awhile and I start talking to this other Omeganaut Patrick, his friends show up later and start talking to.  His friend takes over the conversation and says this to me ""You seem pretty cool, so if you don't have any other plans want to hang out with us.""  I say Uhh I'll see you guys around I'm going to get some Bawls.  His friend follows me, we end up going into the exposition room and running into the other guys.  We play Conker Live and Reloaded.     
As soon as that was over I pretended I suddenly had other plans. LOL they also asked me if I liked Penny Arcade...  I then head towards the console room it's packed so I head away and I do a double take on a guy wearing a powerglove and a zapper.  I ask him if I can take his picture, I stay and discuss Virtual Boy with him and his friends for awhile.  They were all from Seattle and seemed pretty cool.  

I somehow missed the DOOM round of the Omegathon :(.  Anyway apparently the top 2 guys teamed up although it was free for all.  The girl that was remaining only got 1 kill in DOOM.  Also the game crashed with a tie between 2 of the guys and they had to do a 1 on 1 deathmatch.  

I go to Pitch Your Game Idea, it was the funniest thing ever.  Then I start hanging out with more Omeganauts.  The final secret game round is about to start...they announce technical difficulties over the loudspeaker.  I joke ""What is the Atari not working?""  Omeganauts head into the theater for our front row seats.  

A couch is set up in front of a table and projection screen, the console is covered with a cloth.  Final Countdown starts playing and we all scream and clap, it was so awesome.  Then Gabe and Tycho come out.  Then Eye of the Tiger from Rocky starts playing... then the final two Omeganauts come out.  Once again awesome.  They unveil the special Pong Atari...  We all start screaming again.  

It was best 2 out of 3.  Omeganaut Sean won both of them.  During the matches I heard some of the geekiest jokes ever and people were laughing at them.  ""This map sucks!"" Someone shouted the Konami code and someone yelled ""BUT there's only left and right!"" Since Atari paddles were being used.  2nd place still got a $500 gift certificate to EBGames though.

After the Omegathon about half the omeganauts headed to Dairy Queen.  I did some more hanging out and ended up meeting more awesome people.  Can't wait for next year.  I feel like I should have gotten more free stuff though :(.

"event","Less than 12 hours away until Diceland.  I'm going to play a bit of HALO right now.  I wonder if I'll be able to fall asleep tonight.

I really am excited and scared, just going to try to have fun no matter what happens in the Omegathon.  My pacman shirt is waiting in the closet to be worn tomorrow.  I need to get my business cards out in case I meet any industry people.  I hope to meet Mule from polycount tomorrow, another 3D artist that's looking for a job in games, although we didn't designate a meeting place and only talked once in the past 2 weeks.

Yikes I also have the Soul Calibur 2 tournament tomorrow.  I suck at that game now.  

I wish myself luck I think."

"event","Hey PAX and the Omegathon are tomorrow.

I barely had any time to practice this week.  I did hang out with a friend from High School, get paid to play XBox, and now I'm finishing this 3D Model for Flight Sim.  I'll probably lose to a cocky 17 year old who plays 16 hours of games a day.  That's ok $25,000 in games would cause me to faint and then get nothing done EVER.  I hope PAX is all I imagine it to be.  

I'm still anxious about the Omegathon but whatever happens is fine.  I still intend on winning despite everything I've said."

"event","I suppose my journal deserved an obligatory post about this:

My last journal entry was about how I was attending the Penny Arcade Expo which is this weekend.  www.penny-arcade.com/pax  

I mentioned the huge game tournament the Omegathon, now with $25,000+ video games at stake.  Well for those that haven't heard yet, I won 1 of the 20 spots in the tourny.  

Blah I don't feel like explaining it anymore so here are the details:  http://www.penny-arcade.com/pax/rules.htm

I'm nervous, I'm excited.  Wish me luck.  Should be fun.  

I wish I had some HALO competition right at this second..."

"event","I am going to attend PAX! in the Seattle area August 28-29th.  It's in Bellevue, Washington at the Meydenbauer(sp?) Center.

You can check out the event here www.penny-arcade.com/pax 

Tomorrow is the last day to pre register for a chance at winning a spot to compete in the Omegathon tournament to win a $15,000 gaming collection.  Besides the 2 player team Mario Kart and DOOM segments I think I could fare well enough to progress to the second to last round if I were to win a spot in  the tournament.   

I have signed up for the Soul Calibur 2 tournament.  I suck at games because of lack of practice so I need to practice Soul Calibur 2 a lot, I am finally going to see what real competition is like.  There is also a GGXX tourny but I am just going to concentrate my time on one game instead.  I believe there will also be console and PC free play times in between tournys for fun also.

More things I'm looking forward to at PAX: Gaming industry panels on the state of the industry, how to break in to the industry, game development process, pitch your games ideas, online gaming, and Penny Arcade Q&A.  Musical performances, such as Final Fantasy Piano Performance and the Minibosses.  The Wizard and Red Vs. Blue on the big screen as well as the Red Vs. Blue guys at PAX.  Playable HALO 2 (I think) and Fable, as well as other game demos mostly Microsoft and Ubisoft. 

Here are the SC2 tournament rules.  I'm not used to these.
<small>
Soul Calibur 2 (XBox), 128 Person Limit: 

Double Elimination 
You can bring your own controller 
No entry fee! 
Standard VS mode 
Default Health 
Random Stage Select 
Timer = 50 Seconds, Neutral Guard left on 
Best 3 out of 5 rounds 
Best of 2 out of 3 games (3 out of 5 for semis and finals) 
Spawn and Necrid are not allowed 
Assassin, Berserker, and Lizardman are allowed, but Lizardman's command throw glitch is BANNED (the throw itself is still legal) 
Winner must keep character, loser can change character if they wish 
If you pause the game during a match FOR ANY REASON, you won't be disqualified, but you WILL lose the round. If that costs you the match, oh well. Same rule applies if you reset the game as well. </small>"

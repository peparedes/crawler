ok normally i would never do this, but i must dedicate my entry to jessica susan dirocco and the retardedness that bonds our girls together.  i just spent 17!!!!!!!! minutes on the phone with her for no reason...and the only thing that was arrived at is that we must reeducate people on the ways of living like a ghini gangsta. what is wrong with us? we're supposed to be the SMART ones.

am 
so
sick.

whats up everyone. 
the other night, tuesday to be specific, was probably one of the most fun nights i've had at college.

me, nizzly, and daire--tuesday night crew--were planning on keeping it low key and kind of easy, but oh no...

we decided to play kings with 40's of o.e
before too long, i was in an indian headdress, and we were completely smashed. then we decided it would be a good idea to wake people up with brooms and live turtles...needless to say it wasnt in retrospect.
then i thought it would be a good idea to get even more intoxicated and go see the gates in central park while the sun rose. we went up town at around 6 am, and passed out on a baseball bench in central park while we watched the sun rising and it was so much fun. then we got breakfast and passed out at 9 am.  i was out from the night before while i was supposed to be in an 8 am class..thats fucking crazy.

now i feel like shit.
im MO sick.
i might die.
peace."

this probably isnt a big deal to anyone our age. and i didnt know johnny carson, but he was a huge part of my childhood.  everynight when i lived in queens i would fight my mom for control of the remote to watch the tonight show.  its one of my fondest memories of childhood and helped to shape a lot of who i am today.  reading that he died made me sad for some reason, and i cant really explain it."

i watched mean streets the other day, and ive come to some conclusions...even when playing a pychopath robert deniro was HOT. like really hot.  i also decided that johnny boy, robert deniro's character, is one of my favorite movie characters ever.

also, i originally decided not to make any new years resolutions.  after careful consideration however, i've decided to make one.  my new year's resolution for 2005 is to have a sugar daddy at some point this year.  this is not a simple task.  im quickly coming up on the age where sugar daddies are no longer attainable.  i need to do this before im 20.  also, i must lose weight, get a hard bod, find a better fake id that will grant me access into sugar daddy hangouts aka swanky bars and lounges...cause lord only knows i will never find a sugar daddy hanging on the 12th floor or in the backroom of cosmic cantina...but i digress, i must also tan, make more money so as to buy new clothes that dont make me look like a bag lady, and all around become a classier broad.  this may seem daunting, but i vow to do it.  if you will it, it will be so.

the other night we went to the lemon bar.  thanks to my brother, i had stoli peach to pregame with and it was amazing! So me, rachel, violette, matt, bryan, and some other people i cant remember head to the lemon bar real early to get in free.

we go in, sit down, dance a little have a good time.  every night the same kid is promoting the clubs, so we talked to him and he told us to come to his table cause its his birthday.  we go to the back, and there is BOTTLE AFTER BOTTLE of GREY GOOSE!!! i felt like i was in an r.kelly video, i was living my wildest dreams....hhahaha.
i drank so much, i went a little too crazy and did a few regrettable things, like not know how i got home or what i did for about 2 hours.
so yeah...college is quite the experience.

anyways since then ive met a lot of chill people. some really hot gay guys, and a few kids at gallatin. so its been pretty good.

havent updated in a while
hmm lets see

i look kind of human, as i went to bermuda for a week with the fam (CARB CRUISE 2004...oh how i wish i was back on the ZENITH....) had fun, drank enough to slow me down for a while, drank with the ZENITH wait-staff, won the smallest prize for bingo, tanned!,had quality family bonding/gambeling/fighting/drinking time, didnt get hit on at all (except for one guy who was like 7 feet tall, but it was just a compliment) and suprisingly ate the least of all the other people on the cruise....it was a lot of fun.

i somehow gained 4 pounds since my last doctor visit, which means in the interim i lost 15 and gained back 19. way to go!!!! on a happier note, i did grow 1/4 of an inch in a year and a half...suck on that one.

errr.
this could be why i havent updated in a month."

the other day i bought 2 bathing suits. neither bathing suit fits. i spent a total of 86 dollars. i drove on the parkway and realized that merging is bad. i also realized that everything in my aim profile has to do with guns. this must be because i love guns, despite never having held one in my whole life.

its been a while.
crazy times.

some body modification, carl bought me a 40 oz!!!!, lots of hanging with leah and stinky, SO MANY BUG BITES!, finally getting paid--so nice to go out with money in my wallet for a change....and whatever else, a bunch of shit since my last update.

today i went to work at 10...hungover.... it must have been obvious because my uncle sent me around the corner to get him a bagel, and my self a cup of coffee.  i love my uncle dino, the job is awesome. i get paid well, i sit on aim, i go to ebaums world and watch obscene videos, and he pays me for it. what a guy.

after work i picked up m'lady and we went for lunch at stuff'n bagels. we then decided that it would be a good idea to waste our money on arts supplies. so we went home, made the best fucking mix ever and went to pearl paints. we got canvasses! and i bought letters to make some new shirts so get ready for what im bringing.

me and leah painted pictures for each other. i got one that looks like jungle fever alex, and leah got my attempt at being an artist/my tribute to big pun. they came out really nice.

after my grandpa called me snot nosed, and i walked my house in a towel, i proceeded to alison's where we then went to get 3 boxes of pizza rolls (which we ate) cigarettes and to stalk past some peoples houses. watched good old pulp fiction and loafed.
lovely rainy night.

im starting to resemble bhudda, so it is time i start going back to the gym. i have to stop drinking, and diet. im going to be one miserable motherfucker, but if i dont start im gonna start getting stopped for autographs by star wars nerds who think im fuckin jabba.
shiiit"

ok so i dont think ive updated in half a week! OH NO!

i probably have spent most of that time sleeping, drinking, or eating. not neccessarily simultaneously, but perhaps.

my life is so pathetic. i thought i would be really busy this summer, what with 2 jobs and all, but im just a poor, bored, pale little girl.

last night we went to bridgeview. the whole night cost me 5 dollars, and while i really didnt get shitty, it was ok.  i like going out with joie, jessie, cat, and stef(who actually wasnt there)...joie especially is helping to build my tolerance.  we danced a little bit, but for some reason only scary/smelly/creepy/ugly foreign guys want to dance with me. i was in an arabian sandwich at one point and they all thought it was too funny to save me. thats ok, ill have my revenge.......
saw dennes, who seems to be everywhere i go drunk as a skunk and trying to get me to grab his ass.  he was with finn *sigh* who i had the biggest crush on in 9th grade. it sucked to see him while i looked all gross, but he remembered me which was exciting. im such a fagggg. anyways, ash kim and corey were there too and it was nice to see them again.

went home early, cause the music sucked, but jessie stayed. went to GC's where everyone was passed out, so me spoon and cat watched adult swim. consumed massive cheese sandwiches to replace taco's and went home.

now im bored as hell. i was supposed to work today and im not...whatever. my food is here

ANCHORMAN TOMORROW NIGHT!!"

ok so yeah that last entry was uber bitter.  the end of the year was nice, and i enjoyed everything that went on, and im sure ill eventually post pictures. just not yet.

first i have to say i love dan tain.  he steals my surveys, yet credits me with having them first.  he then proceedes to fill them out much better that i ever could.
dan tain, i give you props.


so yesterday i woke up late and had to go to work.  it was ok, except my foot split open while i was at orientation and now i think its going to have to be amputated. yikes!!!! but i digress...so i had work and then i came home and had pizza e birra con la mia madre and il mio padre.  then my italian stallion, matthew bussa<3333, came over bearing gifts.  a bottle of grappa, a roma scarf, and an obscne keychain.  he showed us his pictures, and then we hung out for a while which consisted of us doing nothing but wrestling and arguing...whats new. 

then i went to andrew's.  erik was there too,but he left early.  i had a really nice time with andrew.  we wound up just laying on the couch listening to music and talking, it was a lot of fun...except i had to leave early because he had work the next day, but its ok.

stopped by brians bbq before i went home.
and that was my night.

oh yeah today is my graduation party, anybody up for frozen margharita's and beer...stop by."

ok so i dont fit into any of my clothes anymore.  i blew up like the fucking good year blimp and i didnt even get knocked up! hahaha.

so i feel like friday sucked.  i had work and then a graduation party that i drove to and didnt have very many friends at.  its ok tho, because i like sammy and there were a few people there for me to talk to, i just chose to be anti-social.
me and steve rosener smoked cigarettes outside and talked about the genius of ben stiller.
also, tommy and i drove around blasting big tymers and talking. so that was fun.

i went home really early, but before i went home i called dirocco to get dibs on her for saturday night.
oh what a saturday. we started off at adam miller's where i talked with my love LORNE and spoke with brian fox aka charlies angel about brad pitt and other men we find attractive.  then we left because the library was closing and it was TWENTY BUCKS ALL YOU CAN DRINK! i never knew how shitty the library really was, but it was so worth going to the class of 2002 reunion for OPEN BAR DUDE!!!!
lets just say dirocco got her money's worth. and i think i did too. took it kind of easy, would have liked to stay longer, but what are you gonna do? somehow i lost jessies there. wtf? my closet is bigger than that place.

i drank mostly kettle one and pineapple juice all night, which rocks, but i found an awesome drink--stoli peach and sprite!!!! i think i got more stoli on me then in me, so right before we leave i go to get another one, and im waiting at the bar, and the bartender just walks over to me without asking, pours a full shot of jack, pushes it in front of me and leaves.
it was ridic. i had fun and tucc was awesome for staying sober for the most part.

this morning jessie calls me to tell me shes still alive, and i hear all about her battle wounds.  because i am turning into paul yuskevich, my stomach demanded egg and cheese, and i picked up dirocco for a nice post drinking breakfast.  her mom put me on the spot, but it was funny cause she asked me if jessie was high on drugs. HAHHAHHAHAHAHA.

went to 2-4, chilled with jessie and my lady leah and enjoyed my DISCOUNTED egg and cheese!! :)))

its a good thing i dont know denis leary, because if i did he'd hate me more than he already hated me.
i did the stairmaster at the gym and i dont know if i could ever forgive myself.

also, i decided that i hate everyone. everyone in a very general and loose sense. and i dont really mean hate in the strict sense, but maybe in the loose sense too.  mainly i have problems with dealing with the fact that im *THE* *JERK* *OFF*. see i have a tendency to do things i know are stupid without really realizing, and then when its brought to my attention i feel stupid. id explain better, but it probably wouldnt make sense unless you were in my head. in which case you already know and theres no need for an explanation.
im just in a rut.

also, i have all these weird cuts on my hands and feet and i dont know where they came from"

so

HOT!
oh god, i feel like i was shoved up someones ass in a steam room. its disgusting. but i guess i shouldnt complain, it was cold for so long so its kind of nice.

my life is so pathetic. i need another job, or a boyrfiend, or to begin my plans for world domination.  anything other than freecell and the same 90 songs ive heard 8,000 times.

another pathetic part of my life is my insatiable love of a certain older man.  i think thats better than obsessing over someone my own age. its more fun anyways.

i had one class today. i went to school, hung out, tried to sell some t shirts, and terrorized the social studies resource center(what would i do if i didnt have that joy to fall back on, making other people doubt themselves that is). i then proceeded to bake my organs in the sun and listen to weezer and the stones.  
good times.
my brain is adrophying."

"event","ok.
its so funny how quickly shit changes.
one minute im so happy, the next minute im doubled over in pain, lying in bed, and going to the emergency room.

so after i wrote a really happy lj entry this morning, i go to gym and then to APES.  since i am a tub of lard and all i do is eat, i sat eating my breakfast in class. suddenly im not hungry. then im in total pain.
everyone thought it was funny. thanks for laughing at me!!
(in case that didnt register, i was not pleased)

so i go home and because i cant have a regular doctor i have to go to the emergency room.  by the time i get there im not in pain anymore, yet i have to waste my entire day there.  i had to get an IV in my hand a cat scan. woowooowoo.im wearing the hospital bracelet as proof that i wasnt cutting.

so a small cyst burst on my ovary in case anyone cares and im fine. but honestly, i dont think anyone does care.  and at risk at sounding like a bitchy little girl, no one calls me. and yeah i go out i guess, but i spend every weekedn playing the role of third wheel, which i still have to call to do, and no one really cares.  its probably my fault, but its really disheartening when everyone is out and no one freakin hits you up. one person knew i was in the emergency room, so there is no reason for this.

so suck a fucking egg."

--dance! dance! dance!

--leah gave my number to a really cute guy handing out flyers.  i gave him a hug. 
--the bouncing souls kicked ass
--smoothie king!

my life has become so fucking ridiculously random that i cant even express it fully to you in the here and now.

today i went to school early for no reason and walked around the SSRC and north hall with julz<333. made fun of some teachers and stalked manning, great way to start off the day.
went to a few classes, i think it was 3 today.  then i got to go to the gym!!!!! eat lunch, and nap all before 2 oclock.
fantastic.
woke up, showered, did some hw and met up with my lovers leah and paul.
knocked one back, watched gigi, took a walk, hung out.
then me leah paul and ed went to quizzno's.
need i say more.
family dinner at the goldstone residence and then i got dropped off, where upon entering the house my mom asked ""whats wrong with your eyes?""
wtf?"

im so tired.
today i was like this freakin close to running naked through the school doing backflips, and by this close i mean there isnt enough money, drugs, boose, or sexual propositions that could get me to do what i claim to want to do.  but i was really happy.
THE FINAL FOUR PAGES OF THE YEARBOOK HAVE BEEN SENT IN!!!!
this negga's out of chains....shiiiiiiit..

so i actually got to leave before 9th, and read and go to the gym all earlier than i usually do and it was sooooo nice!!!
then me paul and leah stopped by the baseball game.
gotta love those pants.

went for sushi with my parents and had sake with my dad, the consequence of which was letting my mom drive and by drive i mean nearly kill us multiple times as she tried to find the pet store, which was closed as it should be at 8 40 on a weeknight.

and thats my tale.  a fairly decent day, now i actually have time to myself, too bad its the last fucking week of april.
whatever."

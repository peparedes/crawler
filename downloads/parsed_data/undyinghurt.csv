I HATE HIM and i truly mean it. thats is the only time ive said that and meant it. How can he be cold hearted enough to give up rights to his kids. WAIT let me just say cold because he doesnt have a heart. He has the inability to love. How can he look at his kids and say he doesnt care about them and hes giving them up. I hate him so bad. IM not gonna put up with his crap. im not going to sit around and be his punching bag like my brother was. we are nothing to zack anymore anyways. . hes been to indiana the past three weekends and hasnt came to visit his mom or our side of the family because of dad. My dad needs mental help. really bad. Hes been mest up for so long.

OK so Jeremy was gone and kevin and richard came over to JC's to hang out with sam and she was sleeping so they all got on the couch and she layyed on richards arm and put her feet on kevin, and fell asleep, and later jeremy walked in and started freaking out on them all. I can see how he could maybe get alittle upset about the kevin thing, but he should have just talked to her and told her that it made him uncomfortable or whatever, and he had no reason to get mad over richard at all, but instead of just talking it out with sam he yelled at richard and kevin to the point where they were upset and crying, and they said they didnt think they should be around sam any more because of jeremy. Jeremy is ssuch a penis shribble any more. im tired of his crap and im tired of him treating my best friend this way....eerrr.....and then he starts talking crap about trust to sam....he has no say so about trust, hes the one who lied about hanging out with brianna that whole time untill she died and he finally told sam, and expected her to not get mad cause brianna died.

"event","hhmmm....life sucks, Sams mad at me because im a bitch and i always have to take things out on other people. I wish she would just call me. I MISS HER AND IM SORRy. Yesterday was juat a rally bad day. why??...because me and kevin are soposed to be friends or whatever no, so i decided to see if he has updated his journal recently, well yes he did, and he had to fucking tell the world that he used me that whole time we were going out for a rebound form crystal . i actually believe every one has been a rebound for him since him and sam broke up. SO what he pretty much was saying is tha hes a piece of shit liar that was waisting my time...OH>>>>WHY DO I NOT LISTEN>>???>....Sam i should have listend to you from the begin with. and jeremy, but this is a differetn situation, man you really always trust you friends words over a guys that you are going out with...SO i left a comment on his blurty, not very nice one, but go figure. I mean thats awesome that him and crystal might go out or whatever, but does he really have to tell her thet he never got over her and that he used me to go out with her. come on  now kids.!!!....I know he wasnt upset and thinking about crystal the whole time we were going out. that is bullshit. and he also said in his journal that as soon as he figure out that he was using me that he broke it off, if that is true then why did you try to go back out with me???  HUH???..dont leave me hangin'. eerrr i cant stand him. hes such a fuck up. Hes so fucking dependant, he always has to be with some one, or try to be with some one. Believe me i had to sit on the phone with him listening to how much he loves sam and listen to his lyrics for her for the longest time. before we went out. That was all he ever talked about almost. it was usually that or music. But he never really mentioned anything about his undying love for crystal...hmm....KEvin what is your problem.,???? OH he has undying love for crystal, sam, and when we broke up he wrote a poem and read it to jeremy about his undying love for me. What the fuck???!!!! Kevin really needs prfessional help. If it was all an act then why did he get ALL upset when i asked him if he really loved me>??>, and why did write all of that stuff on his journal about his lvoe for me. i hate you kevin. i would recieve no greater news than to find out you are rotting in hell, or that your life is missery...........l8ter"

I never realized how much I loved you till I lost you!
As much as it pains me to see you gone, as much as I'd like you back, all i truly wish is for you to be happy.
I dropped a tear in the ocean, the day i find it is the day i'll stop loving you*
I love walking in the rain....cause then no one knows im crying
So you love me...you just don't want me?
Wednesday May 26, 2004 9:46 AM ET 
No matter how hard you to hate him for what he did to you--you'll never stop lovin him.
Would you rather never see the person that you loved or never hear them say ""i love you""?
DoN't CrY bEcAuSe It'S oVeR...SmIlE bEcAuSe It HaPpEnEd...:)
How can you mean nothing, to someone who means everything to you?
Love is like Heaven...but it can hurt like HELL!
Its always easy to fall in love the hard part is....letting go
I'm trying really hard not to cry over you because every tear is just another reminder of how I don't know how to let you go...
I asked God for a flower, he gave me a bouquet. I asked God for a minute, he gave me a day. I asked God for true love, he gave me that too. I asked for an angel and he gave me you. But the bouguet is dying and the day gave is gone, the true love is fading, and my angel passed on.
You asked...if i could go back...do it all over again...have fun--be with him...and live life with no problems...but know my heart would be broken and i would be miserable...i would say yes...
Why do I let myself drown in the tears I've cried for you over and over again...when you won't rescue me???
No guy is worth crying over, and when you find the one that is, he won't make you cry
*Between h0lding hands and falling in l0ve..y0u begin t0 learn that: Kisses d0nt alwayz mean something Pr0mises can be br0ken..[just as quickly as they were made]..and s0metimes g00dbyes really are f0rever*
No guy is worth your tears & when you find one that is, he won't make you cry.
Sometimes I wish I was a little kid again....skinned knees are easier to fix than broken hearts!
A MiLLi0n WoRDs Would Not Bring You Back, I Kn0w, BecauseI've Tried. Neither Would A Million TeaRs. I Know, BeCause I've Cried
NoThiN iS mOrE pAiNfuL Then ReALiZiN He MenT eVeRyThiN 2 u,& u MenT nOtHiN 2 HiM
It's hard to tell your mind to stop lovin sumone when your heart still does...
*I'm not supposed to love you, I'm not supposed to care, I'm not supposed to live my life, wishing you were there. I'm not supposed to wonder where you are or what you do, I'm sorry I just can't help myself, I fell in love with you*
Who do you turn too when the only who who can dry your tears is the one who made you cry*
Why does a rose represent love, when a rose always dies?
****STICKS and STONES may HURT my BONES but WORDS will NEVER harm ME~ that AIN'T true- I would GIVE all MY bones TO never HAVE heard THE words THAT took YOU away FROM me****
Wanting him is hard to get. Loving him is hard to regret. Losing him is hard to accept. But with all the hurt I've felt, letting go is the most painful yet
Whoever said love lasts forever was drunk
U say u can't stand 2 c me get hurt,so do u close ur eyes when u hurt me?
WhY Iz iT tHaT eVeRyThInG U SaY MaKeS Me crY
*Not All Scars Show* *Not All Wounds Heal* *Sometimes You Can't Always See* *The Pain Someone Feels*
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm sufferingSo I wear my disguise 'til I go home at nightAnd turn down all the lights and then I break down and cry"

I cant stand her or my sister charli... She is beyond the worst person i know. i cant stand to be around her for more than a minute. shes so immature. Im at sams right now and my mom just called and said i had to come home right now.eerrrr i hope her car brakes down and she cant come to get me. Man im so bored...and me and sam were soposed to do somethin today . Im going to my dads when i get back to greenwood. i dont care what my mom sais . i cant just move back in with my dad. i was alot less stressed out. Man crystal you seriously haventchanged anything. You are still stuck up scotts butt. YOU ARE NOT A MARRIED ADULT . get that through your head. You are growing up way to fast. A normal fifteen year old that has a boyfriend dates him and hangs out with im sometimes....talks to him on the phone....bt doesnt call hima nd have him pick her up as soon as she wakes up in the morning to forfill all of their daily activities together. not unless they were married. oh wait . i forgot, your engaged, right??...that is rediculous too. Hes 18 and a high school drop out with no job, and you are a softmore in highschool. you should not be even thinking about beeing engaged. I really dont care at this point if you get pissed at me because im fed up with it. Every time i call you to try to hang out, i ask what you are doing and i always get the same reply. "" waiting for scott to pick me up. "" Now, crystal, what is a friend to you??....And i honestly think you have way to much freedom for a 15  yr old. Do you think my parents would ever let me go out of state and stay at a motel with my boyfriend??....you sshould even know that that isnt right. MY GOD. youve been with scott like every day this summer , right??...and im soposed to be like your best friend, and weve seen eachother 3 fucking times this whole smmer. and it isnt on me, i had time for you, you just werent there . well im gonna get off of here.

THey tell me the truth for real. TOday was my moms best friends wedding....luara....and she looked so beautiful....so did my mom....i was so happy for her. ... . befor ei went to that wedding....i thought marriage would be misserable....i ....i kinda figured that love was just a security blanket, a pigment of your immagination for self comfortazation. But now, since that was the first weding i have attended since i was a baby....i look at it completely different. Aaron was completely right. it would be awesome to connect with some one on that level. TO look at them and see your unborn children in their eyes. to live in that moment on the dance floor, after you were married. That would rock.  when laura and her husband were having their first dance....it was so worth looking forward too. didnt know why.....i know it sounds korny....maybe it was the song...hhmm....it was one of pearl jams songs....pearl jam was playing most of the night....i cant wait to love someone as i can tell as much as they love each other. they are high school sweethearts. that would be the perfect person to marry. some one you loved since highschool. Your first love. Well that possibilitie has already passed be.... no first love..being my last love....to have and to hold untill death do us part.  It was really cute when lauras husbands mom made a toast and told luara that she loves her very much and hhas been waiting for that moment for 9 years when luara and her son would get married. That was sweet. well im gonna go to see if i can get a ride to JC""S house so i can hang with my nigga Samantha..sanamanatha..hehe....later Dayz"

Im soo happy for sam that sam and jeremy are back gether, but only for sams sake. Atleast shes happy. i get to sit here and rot in my depression. I just want to do something fun to get my mind off things, but all of my friends seem to be too stuck up their boyfriends butt. Maybe ill call crystal and see if we can hang out, but i guess she cant just hang out with me for once with out scott. Yeah scott has a car and he is a cool cat to hang out with sometimes, but when he starts to throw a fit and act like a baby and crystal gives into his fits, i cant stand it. It can really put you in a bad mood. I miss jonny. He was aleays there to talk to when you needed to talk, then he got hotter when he got out of jail, and he got attention from every chic that came around, so he was too busy too hang with me and crystal most of the time. I miss adam too. He always knows how too make you laugh your ass off. In the end ill know who are my true friends. Jerry seems to be the only one there for me right now. But its cool. People shouldnt have to sit around my teary eyed self and ge tthem selves in a mad mood. im just soo fn bored i dont know what to do with myself. well im gonna gitz fer now. L8TER"

"event","Hi im brandi. hehehe. i just decided to make one of these cause blurty can get old. Whats new??...hmm...Kevin broke up with me about a week ago. He didnt really give me a reason. i cried for days and then he told sam, my best friend that he still has feelings for her. That is just the worst thing you can do to me. the day we broke up i got drunk with sam and he told me that he wanted to be friends and all and the next day he told me that he regreted breaking up with me. that makes alot of since, NOT !!! because later that night he messed around with Nikki. EERRR. The one person i was worried about him being around the whole time we were going out. Me and nikki were cool towards the end and all, and then she has to mess around with kevin. SICKENING. She is on my DIE BITCH list. SHe is a chic and she should put her self in my position. Whould she like her boyfriend screwing around with some chic the day after they broke up, and not be mad at that girl.  I should be just as mad at kevin. Maybe i dont want to be mad at kevin so i decided in my head to blame it all on Nikki. Hes the one who knew how i felt. After a few more fights between us, we decided to be friends for real now, and i told him not to lie to me , and i asked him if he messed around with nikki, and he said yes. He sais that he let depression take over him and that was the reason, that he knows i wont ever take him back, and that the real reason he broke up with me is that he cared about me so much that it scared him. right. that makes no since Son. EERR and then yester day i called him and he said hed call me back in ten minutes and he didnt call back that day at all. that made me sad and then i reminded myself that were just friends , but obviously not very good ones if he feels like hes not obligated to call me when he said he would. WTF.... If you dont want to fucking talk to me then tell me. Kevin i want to be your friend for real, but you  are so fucking confusing. What am i just some one to call when you have no one else to talk to?...i dont want to be your FUCKING last resort. that is not what a friend is. I want to hate you so bad and but i cant. no matter how hard you try to hate some one you love, you just cant!!! WTF happend to"" i hate when people throw those words around"" KEVIN>>???? . Isnt that what you did. You cant try to tell me you love me but in a different kind of way. It all comes down to this: You love some one or you dont. im done typing for now. L8ter 

 IM in a really bad mood so dont get all pissed at me for all i say on here."

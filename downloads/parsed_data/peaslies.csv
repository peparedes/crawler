Since she's my parents' gift, I accepted the name my Mom gave.  She baptized her ""Roxy"" even before I could object.  Oh well, she's cute anyway.  She sleeps on her back.  She bites everything she sees.  She runs like a mad dog.  She's like a rat.  And she's shorter than the smallest bottle of Del Monte ketchup.  Hahahaha.

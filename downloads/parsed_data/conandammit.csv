"event","The office is finished for now. There is some wall repair and paint touch up, but it can wait til after the movie. I have other parts of the house to worry about now. Yes, the movie is being shot mostly here, in the house I live in. Cool, huh?

Have not been keeping up with my daily journalling, but nothing is much different. You kind of get the idea. I spent several hours today looking at job postings, just getting more and more despondent. I finally threw in the towel. I was just so down. Everyone wants a fucking 4yr degree, and/or 3 or more years of experience. I don&#39;t have a degree, and anything except carpentry was so far in my past as to be hardly relevant anymore. (Oh, I did document management... 12 years ago.) Fuck me. Anyway. I was going to just go back to bed, and I got as far as disrobing when I thought, Fuck This. I put my clothes back on and started moving furniture upstairs to clear out the main floor for filming. I worked for a few hours, lathered up a good sweat and made an impact on the main level. I felt a bit better after that.

Later I was driving to the library and the blackness returned. Full force. It sucked. Sort of put a damper on an otherwise beautiful day, weatherwise. As soon as I got home I threw in a movie and detached from reality.

Tomorrow, I&#39;ll go put in an app at Home Depot. I don&#39;t know what else to do. I have skills, but they are all too old. Whatever. I fear I will be working at a gas station. Me, working for big oil. Kill me now."

I took most of the furniture and miscellaneous crap out of my &#39;office&#39; and pulled off all the ugly paneling. Tomorrow I spackle and kilz, Thursday I paint. Then I can put the room back together and make it look nice and functional. I really have to quit being so lazy. After I was done with that I watched the 2011 Conan The Barbarian film. It was better than I remember, but I still have a ton of gripes about it. But they are all just me getting stupid. After the movie I started to watch the BSG intro film/miniseries leading up to Season 1, but 45 min into it I got into txt argument with the wife, got pissed and went to bed. I am not sure where this is all going with her. Of course I only slept for 2 fucking hours. I got up and ate a few hot dogs while I surfed the web. Here I am.

"event","Friday I helped my friend Lisa by working on her car. I didn&#39;t really do much besides clean the cables and offer her some advice. After that I showered and headed out to my Aunt and Uncles for dinner. Had some nice ham and had a few beers. Conversation was good. After a couple hours I headed out from there to a hot tub party. Y&#39;all know about that, you were there. Or you should have been.

Saturday slept in late. There is some other crap in here but I forget what it was so it must not have been important. Later I went to Kevelyn&#39;s place for a couple beers and chit chat. She lent me a Dirty Harry box set, BSG season one and something else, which is in the other room but I&#39;m too lazy to go get. I came home and watched some Dirty Harry movies. I tried drinking more beer, but I just was not into it.

Sunday I got up early and then went back to bed, got up, went back to bed. got up and met with DMSKB2000 about her movie and then went home and went back to bed. Finally it was almost time to meet Mom for dinner and theatre. I showered and scooted out the door. Dinner at Champps was good. I had a double bacon cheeseburger that was so dense that I could not finish it. We headed out to the theatre, got there way early and decided to drive around for a while. Then we filed into the space where the play was going to be. It was my old Union Local hall, completely gutted to the bare bones. The play was good, I keep trying to get my friends to go and support this very good director but nobody seems to want to do it. It&#39;s like with all of this electronic entertainment, everyone has forgotten that the best entertainment is human to human. Anyway, it was very good and afterword Mom dropped me off at my truck (at Champps) and I went home. I looked at the beer in the fridge, and just didn&#39;t feel like it. I plopped down on the couch and watched a couple Dirty Harry movies and then went to bed.

Monday seems kind of like an extension of Sunday, as I never really slept for more than 2 hours. I&#39;d get up and do shit for a while, and then go to bed again. I met with bobo, mostly because I have hardly seen him in 6 months or better, and partly to see if he would work on DMSKB&#39;s movie. We had a nice conversation. Then I went home and... yes, watched Dirty Harry movies. After that I watched Gran Torino. Then I tried to go to bed. Slept for 2 hours, got up, fucked around on the interweb and went back to bed. Slept for an hour and a half and woke up. laid there for an hour tossing and turning and decided to get up. Here I am. When Pep Boys opens up, I am going to drive up there and return this fitting I bought for the brake job and I am going to take that $2 over to McDonalds and buy a breakfast sandwich. Then I&#39;ll probably come home and try to sleep again. I feel like a Zombie."

"event","Wednesday was a good day by almost any measure. Sherry and I were going to walk, but it was kinda chilly and the recent snow/thaw cycle had left things icy. We opted instead for some good old fashioned fucking. That was all fine, but I got one hell of a cramp in my leg right at the important part. Kinda funny actually. After that she left to get ready for work, and I headed to the thrift store to find a new pair of lounging on the couch getting fat pants. I browsed the whole thrift store before going to the mens pajama section. I don&#39;t know what I was looking for, nothing really, I just felt like giving the whole place a once over. I picked out a pair of pajama bottoms and headed out. On the way home I called my grandfolks to see if they wanted company. I forgot that Grampa was going to have a lump excised that day, I wished him good luck and went home. I was supposed to meet dmskb2000 at 5 to go over her latest script and draw up new storyboards. I was bored and it was either NAP or GO, so I grabbed the camera and my art bag and headed out. I took the river road to south Minneapolis, stopping only 2 times to take photo&#39;s (the light was horrible). I was still way too early so I stopped in at Cheapo records on Snelling and killed time there. I only had $4.00 on me, so buying anything was out of the question.&nbsp; I got frustrated with window shopping and headed to the Muddy Pig to stake out a table and wait for Dawn. She was also trying to kill time and showed up early, so it was serendipity that we got there within 3 minutes of each other. We made small talk, ordered food and drink. After we ate, we sat there for 2.5 more hours hammering out the films scenes and plot points. It was grueling but fun. I stopped off at home and got some more $ and headed to the beer store.
Later I settled in to watch some movies and drink some beer. The fucking new pajamas did not fit my fat ass. I mean, I could squeeze into them, but I was not going to do much relaxing in them. Crap. That felt nice. Anyway, I watched a few movies and then putzed on the computer until late late into the night, watching mostly you tube videos of people shooting guns at stuff.

Today I woke up late, my throat felt like I tried swallowing an angry cat in my sleep, a sure sign that I was snoring very loudly. I sent Sherry a txt asking if she wanted to go for a walk, she did, but not for a few hours, as she was at work. Later we walked around Columbia Park. I was astonished at my lack of stamina and lung power. Really, very disappointed that I have let myself fall so far. We made it around in 40 min, which is pretty good time, but it was more effort than I remember it ever being. On my way home I remembered it was my father&#39;s widow Marlene&#39;s day off, so I called her to see if there were any chores she needed doing. She always has something. I went over there and for the next hour and a half I fixed this and that. While I was there I also inspected, cleaned and lubricated her two handguns. A Ruger Super Blackhawk .44 and a Browning .22. They were both in good shape, I was a bit concerned because they have been sitting under the couch cushions for 5 years. I got her permission to borrow them whenever I want to take them to the range. I am hoping to inherit them, but I want it to be her idea. After that I stopped up to the beer store and picked up some provisions for tonight and tomorrow. While I was in the neighborhood I stopped in at the Blockbuster that is closing and bought Snakes On A Plane and Gran Torino for .99 each. Came home, showered, went and got a carry out pizza and settled in to watch movies. Snakes was funny and gory. About as silly and horrible as you might imagine. When it was over I was tired so I decided to call it a day. Of course... 2 hours later I was awake. I tried to get back to sleep to no avail. I got up and watched a movie called The Bluetooth Virgin. It was a movie about a oversensitive asshole screenwriter. It was kinda crappy. And now here I am."

"event","Monday I rousted out after a shitty night sleep right at 6am. I filed my unemployment, half expecting it to tell me to fuck off. It did not, and I went back to bed. I got up a few hours later and went out and pulled off the old brake line from the truck. It was more difficult than I wanted it to be because the rear fitting was corroded and a wrench would not turn it. I needed to get out the fucking vice grip pliers and whoop ass on that fucker. After I did that I rode the cycle up to PEP BOYS. They had 99% of what I needed. I stopped over to NAPA and picked up the rest. I got home and had a nice lunch of leftovers. After lunch I installed the tubing. Problem was I could not get the fucking rear brake bleeding valve to open. I drove to Ace Hardware in Robbinsdale and bought a can of Liquid Wrench. Sprayed that little fucker liberally right there in the parking lot. Got home and doused it again. Left it for an hour, and sprayed it again. waited another hour and tried it. NO GO. Well fuck. I undid the closest fitting and filled the resevior with fluid. I went inside and waited another hour. Then I went back and filled it again, then I started the engine and pumped the brake several times. Checked, fluid was running freely from the rear most fitting. I shut the truck off and reattached the rearmost fitting, bathing in a shower of brake fluid. It worked. Brakes are tighter than ever. I drove to the movie store, got a few movies, stopped at the beer store and got beer. Came home and watched movies and got drunk.

Today, woke up late. Did the dishes and then brought movies back to the library, picked up some new ones. Spent about 1 hour filling out an online job app for a job I really want. Took a nap and then cleaned up a bit. Sherry came by and we watched a movie and had dinner. I had beers. She left. I continued to watch movies and drink beer until the movies were over and the beer was gone. here I am about to go to bed. I would already be there, except for writing this dumb shit."

I no sooner got on the freeway when the bikes main tank ran out of gas. I had my fingers crossed the last couple miles, but I made it to Mom&#39;s. The Notbat family came over and eventually the grandfolks showed up. A good time was had by all. After dinner, dessert and a rousing game of &quot;What Time Is It Mr. Fox?&quot; I decided to head home. I got some financial help from my sister and grandfolks, so I was able to get gas upon leaving Moms place and I&#39;ll be able to fix the truck tomorrow. I stopped and picked up some movies on the way home, and spent the rest of the evening on the couch. I dicked around on the web and then went to bed. Slept right away... for an hour.

After I got home I checked in on the intarwebs again, just to make sure nothing cool had happened. Then I called in an order for a Domino&#39;s carry out pizza. I limped the truck down to pick up the pizza. (just cannot imagine getting a hot pizza if I pick it up with the motorcycle). Plopped down on the couch and ate pizza, drank beer and watched a James Bond film. After that, an hour of short films made by lesbians. Then bed.

"event","So, yesterday. Wednesday. Sherry brought me to the bank to get my cash in the morning before she started her first shift. Before that I got out and started working on the truck. It became apparent that the entire brakeline, from the front ABS manifold all the way to the rear needed to be replaced, and it also became clear that it was going to be difficult at best to get to many feet of the brake line because the gas tank was in the way. After Sherry dropped me off, I took the cycle up to the Brookdale library to return and get movies, I then stopped in at Target for cat food. After that I stopped at Pep Boys and determined that this repair was going to cost me $40. more than I had. I went home. I put $20. in an envelope marked BRAKES. I was frustrated but too awake to go back to bed. I grabbed a GNR DVD and fired it up and hopped on the exercycle for the best 22 minutes of fake bike riding I have done in some time. Man, I AM OUT OF SHAPE!! after that I did some minor housework. Dawn came by with beer and we talked about her film for about 30 min, after which we went to the Walker to see a film she had to see for her class. The film was good, it was called Morvern Callar. Dawn dropped me off and I plopped on the couch to watch a movie and drink beer. The movie was a remake of a successful film called The Badnews Bears. It was entertaining. More entertaining than I thought it would be and it made me want to see the original. When the film was over, the beer was gone. But I wanted more beer. I made a bad decision and hopped into the crippled pickup and went to the Eagles Nest in Robbinsdale and drank 3 beers I could not afford. Luckily I made it home okay. I am an idiot.

Today, Thursday. I woke up way late, but grateful to actually sleep for 7 hours in a row. I had a Canon D60 that Dawn had left me so I could start familiarizing myself with it. I put it on a tripod and monkeyed around with it for an hour or so. Then the battery died. I put in the second battery, but it was dead. I got one of the batteries on a charger and started picking up around the place. Dawn came over and picked up the camera, as it had to be back today. After she left, I hopped on the cycle and headed to Aldi. I shopped until I figured I had spent almost $30 (which is all I had). I crammed the $28 worth of groceries into the saddlebags and was about to hop on the bike when the phone rang.
It was Marlene, my father&#39;s widow. We had a dinner date set up for 7:30 and she was wondering if I wanted to meet earlier. I told her to pick me up in an hour. Dinner with Marlene was fun and entertaining. She is a unique and fun person. Genuinely nice. After dinner she asked me if I wanted $20 or a trip to the liquor store, I chose the beer.
After Marlene dropped me off I chilled at the house and watched a movie called Tsunami; The Aftermath. A fictional film based off of accounts of people who survived the Dec 2004 tsunami in the gulf of India. A true horror film. I followed that up with a crappy horror film called See No Evil. and now here I am."

"event","Slept like shit again. I cannot seem to get more than 2 or 3 hours in at a time, then I just wake up. Got up this morning and walked around the house, lost. Looked outside at the light frosting of snow and thought about working on the truck. Nah, wait til the days heatwave burns off the snow. After a very short time, I decided that there was fuckall I felt like doing, and the giant maw of apathy opened me up, swallowed me and I went back to bed. Several hours later I was awakened by the phone. Mom. We talked for a few minutes, what about I could not tell you and after the conversation I got up. There was still a frosting of snow on the ground. Fuck. I heated up the last of the ravioli leftovers from Sunday dinner and ate that. Damn, they really just kept getting better. I thought about posting on FB about how awesome they were, but didn&#39;t. I putzed on the interweb for a while. Then I got the notion to ride the exercycle, so, before apathy could say shit, I ran over and hopped on. On my way, I tossed a GNR dvd of a live performance in Japan in 92 into the DVD player and cranked the volume. I had a decent 20 minutes. The best exercycle experience yet. I&#39;ll have to dig out my other music dvd&#39;s for future sessions.
Following the workout I went out side and dragged the garbage dumpster up from the alley, hauled the recycle bins up and put them away. Then I went into the garage and got the bag of mechanic tools and brought them into the house and put them on a radiator to warm up. Figuring warm tools would be more of an incentive to get outside and work on the truck. Shaved, showered and lurked on the interweb some more. after a while I cooked up some spaghetti for dinner. would have been nice to have garlic toast, or any toast, but it is the day before payday, so no such luck. I was lucky to have the spaghetti and sauce.
By now it was dark so I could quit thinking about working on the truck. I plopped down on the couch and watched the film Sherlock Holmes. I might have gone to see it in the theatre had I ; a)realized Guy Ritchie directed or b) it had not come out the summer my life fell apart. Anyway, it was not Guy&#39;s best film, but it was entertainment. After that, a brief interweb checking and then off to bed. Two hours later I popped awake. When I laid down at 10 I told myself that if I woke up in the middle of the night I would have to sort through the tools in the bag, since last time I used it, it was very frustrating. Yes, in the bag were a multitude of double tools, like I really need to tote around (6) 5/16 wrenches. Turns out I have a full set of imperial wrenches (1/4 - 7/8) a full set of imperial sockets but only partials of the metric equivalents. Here I sit."

After 6 am I logged in to unemployment and filled out my weekly paperwork. Then a breakfast of eggs and toast. Putzed around on FB for a while until it was late enough to begin the dreaded calling. At 8 am I opened up my spreadsheet of all the General Construction contractors in the Metro and started calling and asking if they were hiring. MOST just flat out said no. A couple said no, but I can still fill out an app, and one, ONE said &quot;Um, maybe in a couple months&quot;. Then I opened up the spreadsheet of sub contractors that hire Union in the Twin Cities. Called 9. EVERY one said, NO. Got depressed and went back to bed.

Woke up a few hours later. Ate some ravioli, putzed on FB, and then decided to do something. I finished fixing a window frame in the house that had been damaged from many years of ice dam leakage. The trim had become warped, so last week I removed it, soaked it in water and then placed it in a vice and let it dry, straight. I put that back together, hung up the freshly washed blind and felt pretty good about a job done. Then I hopped on the bicycle for 20 min. Then I took a nap.

I was awakened by my phone. Grampa calling. I answered it, he had some news and rambled on forever. So, I got up. Contacted Sherry about our VDay date to confirm time and stuff. Shaved, took a shower and began cleaning. I got the garbage out, the dishes done and the dining room table cleared. Sherry called back, she really really wanted to go somewhere to eat and see a movie. I had a gift card at Ruby Tuesday, so we decided to go there. Halfway through dinner, she got tired, so we finished eating and called it a night. She brought me to get a movie and dropped me off. I watched Columbiana while I munched sunflower seeds. Now, here I am. Not tired."

We hung out at Papa&#39;s Deli and Pizza and noshed on some good food and did rough story boarding.
That started late, so it bled right into my evening plans, dinner at Mojocatt&#39;s. Mojocatt had whipped up a huge batch of ravioli, it was hella good. Had a few beers and some nice conversation with him and his family.
Got home, watched episode 2 of The Kingdom and went to bed. Slept 2.5 hours and here I am. Maybe I&#39;ll get on the exercycle."

Friday Feb 10, 2012. I woke up early, actually 10 minutes before the alarm, at 7:50 am. I had to piss so I decided to just get the fuck up. After pissing, I turned on the radio and cooked up a 3 egg breakfast. I regretted turning on the radio, since it is beggar week for the public radio. Fuck, I have no $ to give you bitches, leave me be. After breakfast I decided to tackle a job that has bothered me since I moved in a year ago. One of the dining room windows has trim that has warped from water leakeage. I decided to fix it. I removed the filthy horizontal blind and washed it in the shower. After that I pried out the bent piece of trim and soaked it in water. While it was soaking I cleaned out the other trim of debris and pounded it all back into place. (up to 1/4 inch gaps fixed). I then took the piece of trim and put it in vices to straighten it out.

Now I have to wait at least 24 hours.&nbsp; I got bored. I cleaned, picked up all the garbage. I discovered that I was out of kitchen garbage bags. It was too cold to go to the store. I went back to bed. I slept for many hours.

I awoke to the phone ringing, it was Sherry. Her brother owed her $20. did I want it, and a ride to run errands? Hell yeah! Al came and we went to the Dollar store where I got some sunflower seeds and black pepper. Then off to RC liquor where I got a 12 of Ranger. Al brought me home.
I spent the next several hours watching Danish movies. Then I got out some beers and started watching a Romanian film. In no short time I was craving a tit to fill my hand. After a few txt messages things got out of hand with Sherry. Here I am. What do I have to do to get my hands on some tits?

"event","At the house on Colfax we had a lot of company, Dad&#39;s friends, Dad&#39;s brothers, Dad&#39;s brothers friends or some combination all of the time, or so it seemed to me. After nightfall, I had to be home and this meant that I had to be furtive. I had to be like a fox. I could hang out where the adults were, as long as I kept my mouth shut and did anything they asked, which usually meant fetching a fresh Oly.
One day, and I remember it was daylight, so it was a weekend, I was playing in the living room and one of Dad&#39;s friends was sitting on the couch. At some point he called me over, handed me a something made of cardboard and said &quot;Hey Kid, gimme a light&quot;. I held the package and said, Don, I don&#39;t know how these work. I had seen matches in action every day since I remembered, but I never paid attention to how it worked, I just did not care. Don looked at me a bit funny, laughed and said &quot;Kid, I&#39;m gonna change your life&quot;. He proceeded to show me step by step how to light a match from a book of matches. After I had proved I could do it for over half a book, he had me light his joint. After exhaling, he looked at me, handed me a fresh book of matches and said, &quot;Danny, don&#39;t ever let yourself be without a book of matches, this will save&nbsp; your life someday&quot;. I took the matches and put them in my pocket. Soon enough he was high enough to forget me, and I resumed playing with whatever it was I was doing.
I put that book of matches in my pocket every morning, and took it out every night. I carried them with me for weeks and soon enough, a chance to show my older friend Jake my new power presented itself. Jake was a bit older than me, and was willing to play with me as long as he was the boss. I had never seen Jake light a match, or even talk about it... so I kept my power secret, knowing that if I told Jake at the wrong time, he would make life bad for me. One day we were playing in an alley behind the Skinner place. I don&#39;t remember the game, but Brian Skinner came out and chased us up the alley. I ducked out of the alley, and Brian caught Jake and roughed him up pretty bad. I did not see Jake for a few days. When I did, he was mad. He wanted revenge against Brian. This was gonna be tough, Brian was several years older than us, much stronger, and had a bunch of friends who had the same advantage. One day soon after that found Jake and I in the narrow space between Brians house and the neighbors house, the houses nearly touched. This crack in housing happened to be directly across the street from where I lived. Brian had just that afternoon chased us both 3 blocks. We were mad. We sat on an old mattress that was folded from the ground against Brians house and talked about what we could do. At some point I mentioned that I knew how to light matches, and to my surprise, Jake derided me and called me a lying baby. I insisted that I knew how to light matches, and after being bullied some more I let on that I had a book in my pocket.
Well, I had no choice but to show Jake how to light matches. We lit one after the other and finally ran out, just about time to head home. Jake went his way, I went mine. I got home, talked to my parents, brushed my teeth, went to bed. I went to sleep with no guilt on my head.
I don&#39;t know what time it was when I heard the sirens and the rusting in the house. I got up and ran out front. The house across the street was on fire. The Fire department was putting it out. The residents were out in thier underwear, so were half the block. I started screaming something about it not being my fault. My Dad, recognizing this as a bold admission of guilt scooped me up and ran me into the house. After the fire was put out (nobody hurt) and cause put on reckless teens letting a cig burn a mattress... I got the one and only real whuppin of my life. Brian&#39;s family moved away, so we never had to deal with him again. Jake and I however continued to cause trouble..."

It was worn pretty thin, the previous owner was a chronic curb rubber, and the sidewall was worn through pretty bad, and not surprisingly that is where it failed. So, I put the spare on. The spare is in FANTASTIC shape. Then after some shopping around I settled on a new tire. I got a decent price on a low end tire and I think I am going to try to replace all of the tires, I mean, They are all 5 years old at the minimum, and have spent the last 5 years just sitting and getting old.

I&#39;d feel better about buying new tires if I had actually paid for the last set of tires I got on my GMC. Come on caveman, let me sheetrock the ceiling of your LR/DR and do the crown molding in your den. I gotta pay you back somehow. And Money is not forthcoming."

"event","When I was 6 years old my family lived on a quiet block in north Minneapolis. It was your typical urban neighborhood made up of young and old, mixed racial types and a nice mix of single family and duplex rental type housing. My house was second from the corner, my best friend on the block, Jake, lived across the street and 3 houses down. I have many memories from living in this house, I learned to ride a bike here, and subsequently having my first nasty bike crash, I learned how to light matches, tasted my first cigarette, learned about cliques, and got my first stitches all on that block. Jake and I got into much hijinx as are wont when a 6 year old and an 8 year old are allowed too much freedom.

Jake lived upstairs in a white duplex, downstairs lived a family whose children were much older than us. They had a dog whose name was Rocky. Rocky was a black lab mix and got his name from his favorite activity which was fetching rocks. The white house had landscaping consisting of medium sized river rock, 2 - 3 inch, smooth rocks and if you threw one of these rocks, Rocky would bolt after it and no matter how far you threw it, or if you threw it into bushes Rocky would bring it back. Rocky&#39;s teeth were worn down to nubs from chewing rocks all day every day.

Jake, myself and the other kids from the block that were about our age would spend hours throwing rocks for Rocky. On this particular afternoon it was just Jake and myself playing with Rocky. It was the time of day between when I got home from school, and when my parents got home from work and I don&#39;t recall having supervision. Jake and I were throwing progressively larger rocks and had just about gotten to the point where the rocks we were throwing were as big as we could throw any distance when Denny, the youngest of Rocky&#39;s family came home. He watched us for a minute and then decided to show us what throwing a big rock was all about. He picked up a rock that seemed huge to us and threw it all the way across the street and into the bushes by the turquoise house. Jake and I were in awe. Throw another we both yelled, and the race was on to see who could find the biggest rock Denny could throw.

Jake found a whopper and Denny threw it across the street, it bounced off the sidewalk and went kittywampus into the Bebalds garden. Of course Rocky was loving it, his favorite person was throwing BIG rocks! No more pebbles from us little kids! We were finding rocks and Denny was throwing them in a frenzy, soon several other kids had joined it. I was in between the group and the street, rooting around in a different pile, hoping to find the biggest rock. I became absorbed in the quest, picking up rocks with both hands and discarding them as too small. I wanted to find the biggest one. Meanwhile the rock throwing frenzy continued, with Rocky running up and down the block and back and forth across the street, a gaggle of kids yelling for him and Denny.

Then I found it, this had to be the biggest, I had to dig around it with my fingers, and it was all I could do to pry it out of the ground. I hefted it with both hands, and for just a moment I thought maybe it was too big. Then, I suddenly turned and began to run to Denny, holding the big rock close to my chest. Just as I turned and took two steps I felt something hit me hard just above my left eye, I saw stars and fell down dropping the now forgotten rock as I went down. I had run right into the path of the rock Denny had just thrown. I lay there on the sidewalk screaming, holding my hands to my eye. I heard Denny, Jake and the other kids gather around, Denny trying to get me to move my hands. After a moment I pulled my hands away and when I did I saw they were covered in blood, my blood. I screamed and Denny ran into his house. I sat on the sidewalk bawling, surrounded by the kids from the block and Rocky sitting there chewing on a rock, waiting for the action to begin again.

Denny&#39;s Mom came out and when she saw me sitting there bleeding all over she ran over to me. She pulled my hands away and took a quick look. She yelled to Denny to get a towel, and picked me up and brought me to the car. She bundled me into the car, Denny came back with a towel and hopped into the back seat with me and held the towel to my head as his Mom drove us to the Hospital. By the time we got to the hospital I had calmed down somewhat. That would not last. I don&#39;t remember having to wait, it seemed that suddenly I was surrounded by strangers, shining lights in my eyes and making my owie hurt. I struggled, I did not like what they were doing. I did not understand that they were trying to clean the wound so they could stitch it. It just seemed like they were rubbing their fingers in it for no reason. Soon they had had enough of my squirming and crying.

Several nurses (they were called Orderlies back then) grabbed ahold of me and held me down to a table, where my legs and arms were strapped down. Then my chest and waist was strapped down. And finally my head was strapped in place. I was completely incapacitated. I was screaming. About this time I recall seeing my Mother. I screamed for her to get me out of there, to make them let me go. Then they put the surgical paper over my face and blotted out the lights and the strange faces. As the paper was put into place I could see that there was an opening in it which was placed over the wound. I continued screaming. I could no longer feel pain in my forehead, but I could feel them touching me, applying various kinds of pressure. I had no idea what was going on. I could not figure out why my Mom would let them strap me down like this. I did not know what I had done to deserve to be held down.

It seemed like hours later when they took the paper off my face. I was hoarse from screaming and my face was sticky with tears and puffy from the trauma. My Mom was there, talking to me in a soothing voice. They unstrapped my head, my chest, my waist, and finally my arms and legs. Mom scooped me up and hugged me and told me I&#39;d be alright. I stopped crying and my heart stopped pounding in my chest. Denny&#39;s Mom and Denny were there, Denny said he was sorry. Sorry for what? I wondered. We went home.

The next day the word was out. No more throwing rocks for Rocky. It seemed like a big chunk of our fun on the block had been taken away. The kids on the block looked at me like it was my fault that we could not throw rocks. Rocky looked depressed. He would go from kid to kid with a rock in his mouth, imploring us to throw it. Nobody would. For about a week."

"event","So life seems to be just an endless series of trying to do the right thing. Trying to fight the urge to do selfish things, and then of course plenty of time regretting the moments when you did do something(s) selfish. So. What then? You do the right thing over and over and over and then what? Nothing thats what. NOTHING. This is the basic problem with not believing in religion. There is no reward, there is no punishment. There is nothing. Not that religion is something, it is just a belief that there is something. I don&#39;t know. I did not sit down to write about religion. It just fell out of my head.

So about 15 years ago I decided to start just trying to do the right thing. Actually TRYING. So far, I think I&#39;ve done okay, since I have not killed or even maimed anyone. And during my times of need, things have happened, good things, which I largely attribute to the &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; theory. And I am thankful for that, and I try to be mindful of that whenever I am tempted to be selfish or inconsiderate or refuse an opportunity to help someone else, regardless of how much I just want to sit at home and drink and ignore the world.

But no matter how much I try to do the right thing, and no matter how much it gains reciprocations when I am down... I just seem to be sinking lower and lower. I just seem to be getting further from success, further from the possibility of success. Survival is starting to look kind of flaky. I keep trying to do the right thing. Yet here I am. Squatting, on the dole, loser. losing hope and losing interest in hoping. But I wont quit. I&#39;ll keep doing the right thing. Yup. Gonna keep doing the right thing."

She was at a bar and overheard some lame excuse for a male of the species say something like &quot;Ah, she&#39;s just afraid of the dick&quot;. Now it should be noted that my friend is a gay woman. Okay. So. Afraid of the human penis. Really? I am a man and I have one, one that according to everything I have read is somewhere in the average range size wise. Absolutely nothing to be afraid of. Now, a Stallion penis is pretty intimidating. And elephant penis is terrifying, and I have heard that Dolphin penii are something to strike fear into a human as well. But a HUMAN PENIS? Even a very large human penis is nothing to be afraid of, especially if you have a counterpart as elastic as a vagina. I mean, show me a penis bigger than a fist. I still wont be scared. I will be impressed. But not scared. So I am thinking that no, my friend is not afraid of your tiny little penis, or any other penis for that matter. Maybe she finds them a bit inadequate?

"event","I&#39;ve got a very mature silver maple in my back yard. I moved in in November last year, under stressful conditions so I did not notice the leaf color, or even what kind of tree it was. When I discovered it was a maple this spring, I had high hopes. Aside from those oaks whose leaves&nbsp; turn a deep reddish purple, Maples, with flaming reds and deep oranges are my favorites. So it was with anticipation that I watched this tree this fall, waiting for a change. It waited too. It did not start turning until two days ago.
Did my maple turn from a verdant green to a flaming phoenix in red? Or did it blaze orange to make every hunter within miles around turn envious? NO. The leaves wilted from deep green to a pale yellow. A dreadfully boring yellow that even the backlighting of&nbsp; the setting sun cannot make spectacular. I shook my head and pondered.
All those annoying helicopter seedlings in the spring. A home for every squirrel in the area. And no payback in the fall. Just late season raking. What a disappointment.

Tonight I sat and pondered this tree, so full of potential, so full of anticipated beauty. So full of disappointment. It really reminded me of myself. In the flower of my youth I showed potential. I could have blazed with the most dazzling red, so red as to make all other reds hide and turn cyan. I could have been a bright orange, perhaps mixed with a yellow of such boldness

Timer called 600 seconds.

that other oranges and yellows slunk off into the shadows and hung their heads, choosing instead to become tertiary colors than to be compared to mine.

But no. Instead I burned out to become a lump of unrecognizable grey. Looking at me now nobody would even think that I had ever had any color at all, much less believe that my colors could have eclipsed the rainbow.

I just saw things that logically happened in certain places happen there, with the benefits shipped world wide. Diamonds come from South Africa, so Globalization meant that those diamond workers would get good pay and health benefits. Iron ore was found at X place, so those folks would get good pay. Whatever was best produced or found, wherever it was best produced and found would be dealt with, and soon everyone on earth would be enjoying a fine living. because cost and price would be balanced. Bizarre gov. tarrifs would be eliminated. The whole earth would be run by one govt., a govt that cared about the citizens. A govt. that saw all of it&#39;s people as equally important.

What a fool I was.

The corporations beat me to it, and fucked it all up. Now instead of the entire earth gaining from sharing, only 1% of the worlds population gains, and 50% suffers TERRIBLY. 20% suffers, 10% thinks it&#39;s okay, but it&#39;s not.

I mean shit. I already spend most of my spare time reading political and ethical writings.

hmmm"

"event","10 minutes of stream of conciousness writing, spelling and grammar be damned. An effort to pump up the creative juice maker, as it were. I have wanted to start writing again, you know, like ALL FUCKING SUMMER WHILE I SAT AROUND COLLECTING MASS. But no. I didn&#39;t. So here I am, doing something, anything. Clawing and grasping to find meaning in a hopeless and rediculous world. Trying to find meaning in the meaningless, trying. When I read Bukowski I want to write. When I read Miller, I want to write. And now it turns out, when I read Gaiman, I want to write. So here I am. Clickety clacking away. Next post may or may not be&nbsp; more coherent, might have a point, might. Or, it might just be another fuckall ramble like this one. I had dinner alone again tonight. Well, not exactly alone. Neil kept me company. It was a one way conversation however good.

I have to come up with an outlet for my frustrations. Drinking does not seem to help. Okay, well, for a few hours it kinda dulls the urge to break things and run around naked, but then the next day I still want to break things and run around naked, only I also feel guilty for spending money on beer. Yes, that fucking broke where a $12.00 12 pak of beer gives me the guilt trips. Fuck that. Anyway.

I really like the band Dawes. If I could convince myself it was more valuable than beer I would buy a CD of theirs. As it is I just listen to the Current and they play one of 5 songs every couple hours. Probably enough. Sure.

Well, one minute to go. I finally did something I wanted to do. Lets see how long this keeps up before I let it slip... like exercise and dieting, and being a good boy. prolly not to long is my guess. Nothing gold can stay."

I wish this rain would have waited until I was done with the footings at my current project. Crawling around in mud to cut out the roots that prevented the initial footing digging does not sound like something I am going to do."

Surprised I lost the one pound that I did lose.

Time to get back on track. I am so over being this fat."

"event","I went to Brooke's dad's wake last night.  Wakes seem somewhat barbaric to me.  Parading dozens of people in front of a body that no longer holds the spirit of a loved one.  Jack didn't look anything like himself, I struggled to find some similarity I could hold on to, but there were none.  I didn't recognize the man laying in the casket, which is probably the reason I was able to keep from crying as much and as easily as I normally do.  I only cried when I reached Brooke and her mom, realizing that nothing I said could really help.  I simply said, ""I'm sorry for your loss"" to Brooke's mom, and gave Brooke a big hug.
Brooke has decided to go to AC for the annual conference after all.  She's driving to my house tomorrow morning, and then the two of us will drive down from there.  It is my mission for the next few days to try to comfort her as much as I can, and keep her as occupied as possible.  Hopefully I will be able to help in this little way."

"event","I'm going to try to write a journal entry once a day, and expose my feelings to the world.  Of course this will probably end tomorrow, but three days in a row is a good start, right?
Managed to get a ton of stuff done today.  Still a ton left to do, and I'm exhausted. :-/  I feel like I always have ""shit to do"".  Sometimes I wish I could be more free, less self-restricting, more laid back... but instead I drive myself crazy making lists of the shit I need to do.
I think I need a vacation.  Just leave everything behind.  It can't get done while I'm away, so f* it.  Maybe after Dale gets settled... but then I'm sure I'll find another reason to put it off.

"event","I'm sitting here in Dale's apartment, up in the loft, typing on his computer in this place for probably the last time.  He's on his way home from work, hopefully picking up yummy food on the way.  I'm starving, and reminiscing about the good times we've had here.  I'm sure we'll have more good times at my house, but it will never be the same.
I remember coming down here the first time, about a week and a half after our first date.  It was a spur of the moment kind of thing.  We were talking on aim one night and I randomly offered to come down here to watch a movie.  Secret window, with Johnny Depp.  I don't know why I did it, I hardly knew the guy, had only been on one date with him, who knew what could have happened?!  But there was a sweet innocence about him.  A cute nervousness from our first date.  I remember him saying goodnight and walking directly into the mirror of his jeep. :-)  So I came down here, and we sat, holding hands on his couch, watching the movie.  And then shared our first kiss on the stinky guy couch.  I'm sure he scrambled while I was on my way down to clean the place up.  It was fairly neat I remember, and took note.  Didn't stay that way, but hey, first impressions aren't everything.  It was a very special evening, and I remember getting home way too late.  But it was worth it.
You can't ever replace first memories.  They still make me smile now. :-)
Goodbye 131 Hudson Ave, Apartment 3-B.  I hope the next tenent enjoys the lofts as much as we did."

"event","I went to my first ""OakWood Village Property Owners Association"" annual meeting tonight.  It was held in a meeting room at a local hotel.  I was by far the youngest person there.  There were a couple of people in their mid-late 30's, but the majority of the people in attendance were old.  The room was filled with old people bickering about the budget, money, and what should or shouldn't be fixed.  Should we get new fences or repair the ones we have?  Should we install a sprinkler system, or replace shrubs and plants every year because some people refuse to water?  I guess all of the stuff was relevant, but I found it tedious and annoying.  Thank god it's only once a year.  I'm safe until April 2007. :-)

I'm trying to be as productive as possible though.  I finally painted a wall in my house other than white!  I plan on filling it with bright, fun, intense colors, but up to this point, all I had painted was white.  The wall in the dining room (behind the mirrors) is now a warm caramel color.  And the weird beveled mirrors are gone, replaced with one big cool looking mirror with a thick black frame.  I like it much better, and it looks more contemporary.
This is a big step.  And there will be more to come. :-)"

"event","So I'm on my way to work this morning, all proud of myself that I got out at a reasonable time, and was on schedule to be at work on time.  I was cruising up the parkway, near exit 153 (rt. 3), staying in the middle lane, minding my own business, talking to my mother on the phone.  The traffic in that section of the parkway is always slow and kind of stop and go, with lots of people entering and exiting.  I always leave plenty of room in front of me in order to stop, just in case, because I'm a careful and conscientious driver.  Apparently the asshole behind me was not.  I hear tires screeching, and I look up into my rearview mirror, and I see a car (travelling way too fast), and tire smoke coming out from his wheels.  Of course I'm scared shitless, and my heart starts to race.  I instinctively let off the brake a bit, to allow the car to roll and take up some of the impact (and because *I* had plenty of room between me and the car in front of me), and pow, he hit me.  Not very hard, thank god, he had managed to slow most of the way before the impact.  I say to my mother on the phone, ""gotta go, someone just hit me."" and hang up, freaking her out completely.  Once safe, I pop out of the car, make sure nothing's hanging off or whatever, and then we move over to the side of the highway.  I assess my car completely, bumper, under the bumper, tailpipe, etc.  And there was basically no damage except for a tiny scuff on the bottom of the bumper, not a big deal.  I'm not going to worry about that.  His car, however, had a nice sized scratch, and small dent in the hood, where his hood went under my spare tire in the back.  I believe I'm quite justified in being happy about that one.  Retribution is a bitch.
He asked me (a couple of times) if I was OK, and I said I was fine, wasn't a very hard hit at all.  Never apologized though, even though he was completely in the wrong.  That would have been the nice thing to do.  Before I let him get back in his car and drive away, though, I yelled at him.  Told him he's gotta be careful, people stop in that section of the parkway all the time, he can't be hitting people, he needs to keep in control of his car, etc.  Of course, knowing myself, it was probably more of a stern lecture than actual yelling.  I'm far too nice, and much less assertive than I need to be, but it made me feel better to think that I yelled at him.
This is the THIRD time I've been rear-ended on the highway.  The first two times I predicted it though, watching the guy behind me for a while, seeing them get too close, have to stop short a few times before, etc.  So I expected them to hit me.  This time was a total surprise, and I think that's why it had a bigger impact on me.  Scared the shit out of me. :-(
So anyway, I get back in my car, and drive away.  Heart still racing, driving super cautious now, and scared of everything.  Ruined my morning, ruined my previous good mood, threw me off for the whole morning, and set the stage for the rest of my horrible day.
Thank you Mr. Black Maxima.  I hope I fucking ruined your day too, asshole."

"event","My computer has been very ill as of late.  I'm not exactly sure what's wrong with it... either a malware problem, windows glitch, or some combo of the two. :-(  Makes me very sad, and very very very frustrated.  I wanted to throw stuff when it first happened.  Jackee has been helping me work through it, and it's somewhat functional now, though still a bit slow.  We have decided that the best course of action is to format and reinstall windows.  But I need to save all my stuff!!!  So I'm researching getting an external hard drive to make this process easier.  Anybody have any clues about what's a good one?
I have also been very ill as of late.  I felt really out of it and kinda crappy all last week.  I thought it was because my stress-level at work was through the roof, but apparently I was wrong.  I came home friday from work, and pretty much collapsed.  I had a fever, headache, body aches, chills, etc.  I don't know exactly how high the temp was (since I have not yet invested in a thermometer since moving...), but I felt like crap.  Advil seemed to keep it under control.  Dale came up, fed me soup and dumplings, and attempted to entertain.  I woke up saturday even more miserable.  The fever was higher (by the Dale testing-guage), and advil didn't take it away.  I spent the entire day in bed, miserable, and dozing in and out of consciousness.  I felt a little better on sunday, but still had a slight fever in the morning.  And spent most of the day in bed as well.
Well, today is monday.  I feel 100%, but I played hookie from work anyway. ;-)  Didn't get ANYthing accomplished over the weekend, so I did it today.  Laundry, ironing, shopping, cleaning, etc.
I'm sort of amazed by my random sickness.  I had no other symptoms other than a fever, and the associated crap (body aches, headache, etc.).  Where the hell did that come from?!  And what the heck was it!?
I don't think I""ll ever know, though my mom said that I had ""mystery fevers"" when I was a kid as well.
Oh well, I'm better now, and got to save the cost of a day's gas to and from work.  Woo hoo!"

"event","Sometimes the weeks fly by, without me even realizing.  It's been such a long time since I've posted on here, but I can't recall exactly what's happened in that time.  Specifics are kind of fuzzy, but I guess the big thing is that Dale's moving in.  It's taken up most of my time planning and thinking about that.  I'm trying to get the house in some semblence of order, and trying to downsize some before he moves all his stuff in.  I don't want the house to get crowded, and I'm paranoid that it's going to be.
I'm also paranoid that Dale's going to wait until the last minute to throw out stuff, pack up the stuff he's moving, and then get me all stressed trying to move it here.  I keep telling myself that it's his job, and his stuff, and if he doesn't get it done in time, it's HIS problem.  But it's not helping.  He hasn't really started doing anything yet.  The only thing from Dale's apartment that is here yet is the Dali picture that *I* took off his wall, and hung up in the master bath.  It would be so much easier if he would just go through stuff a little at a time, and bring a jeep-load of stuff everytime he comes here.  I know he's been really busy with work, and his new management position, but there's not much time left, and like I said before, the weeks fly by.

And now for the house updates... 
I've been sewing all kinds of curtains (living room, kitchen, master bath, and I've started the master bedroom), and I've managed to sew a new cover for ONE of the seat cushions.  There's 11 more to go. :-(
I ripped out all of the ivy that was in the flower beds in the backyard.  It hadn't been cared for really, and was kind of out of control.  Growing up all the topiaries, up the house, up the fence, into neighbor's yards, etc.  And I just don't feel like trying to keep it tame.  It's ok to look at, and a decent ground cover, but too annoying and too much work for me right now.  Instead, I ordered a bunch of perennials from the spring hill nursery catalog.  I got it all half off, so I went all out.  A bunch of pretty flowering perennials, and some NON-CLIMBING ground cover that flowers as well. :-)  I think my favorites are going to be the toad lilies, but I'll have to test to see if I have a green thumb first.  I haven't been able to have plants inside the house because of Buddy (the plant-eating, then vomiting cat), so who knows if I can even keep stuff alive?!  I think the stuff will get here in a couple of weeks, after the last frost.  They're supposed to email me when it ships, and I can't wait!
I also need to tear out a shrub from the backyard, but I haven't gotten to that yet.  The trunk got split and broken from the heavy snowfall, and half of the plant is laying on the ground, hanging out of the planting bed onto the patio.  It's starting to turn brown and die, so I figured I would put it out of it's misery.  Cutting the actual shrub down  will be the easy part.  I'm worried about getting the roots out, because it looks like it's been there for a while, and I don't know how far down or out they go.  I've borrowed a big shovel and scary looking saw from my dad, so maybe I'll get to work this weekend.  Depends on the weather.
I've also picked out color swatches for the neat stencil I'm going to do in the living room and/or dining room.  I just need to decide if I'm going to paint one wall in each room as an accent wall first, or just leave them all beige.  And then of course I need to get to Lowe's to buy the paint!
All these projects, and so little time to work on them. :-(

I'm having lunch with Ushta and Roz on saturday.  I'm excited to hang out with both of them.  I haven't seen Ushta in weeks!  I am somewhat disappointed though.  It was supposed to be a girl's night sleepover, but it got severely downgraded to a ""lunch hang-out"" by Ushta.  Not even a dinner. :-(  I know she's busy planning her wedding and has had a crazy work schedule and family obligations come up, but for months and months now she hasn't had time for us (meaning me and Roz).  A few emails here and there, even fewer phone calls, and even fewer still times to hang out.  And I can't help but feel like we're no longer as important to her, and it saddens me.

I will try to post on here more often, because it does feel good to get it all out.  I just need to focus on setting the time aside to do it.  I will try."

"event","Ok, so I got nudged by Jackee to post a journal entry, since it's been a while.  But I've been busy, super busy!  I know I've got ""shit to do"", and I will always have ""shit to do"", but I should make time for the important stuff.  Unfortunately, livejournal is not always at the top of the important stuff list.  But tonight it is.
So, what to write about...?
I finally finished the renovation project in my bathroom!  There's a few more decorating things to finish up, but all of the major time-consuming bullshit stuff is done.  The project took up about 6 weeks of my life, and involved re-grouting the tile in the shower stall, stripping the wallpaper border from the wall, spackling the bazillion holes and imperfections in the walls, painting over the awful blue color (THREE coats of white paint later...), installing a new towel ring, new towel hooks, new doorknob, new electrical face plates, new pull knobs, refinishing the mirror frame on the medicine cabinet, and probably a bunch of other little stuff that I've managed to put out of my mind.  It was a long and arduous process, but well worth it.  I think it looks awesome, and I'm super proud that I was able to do it myself, with a little help from my dad and Dale.  There were many bruises, almost broken noses, scrapes, and much paint on the skin, but it's all done now!  I just need to find some neat art to hang on the wall, and new curtains for the windows, but that stuff can happen at anytime.
The next project, of course, is attempting to remove the wallpaper in the bathroom in the hallway.  I think I'm going to give myself a week or two to rest before starting that one.  That one might be a doozy.
I just realized how pathetic I am to talk about my home renovations first, like it's the most important and exciting thing in my life.  I have to admit myself that's pretty lame.
I went to Dale's superbowl party last night.  It was pretty fun!  Couldn't hear the tv over the roar of the crowd, but if anything important happened in the game, or any awesome commercials came on, Dale would use his magical DVR to rewind live tv and show us again.  Keith was at the party as well, and I was excited to get a chance to talk to him.  I haven't seen him in a while, and he is one of my favorites of Dale's friends.  Keith's taking classes towards becoming an interior decorator, and has vowed to help me decorate my house.  I asked for help especially in the living room and dining room, to give them separate identities, but still coordinate with one another.  It should be awesome.  There was talk of Dale and I getting together with him and Boo this weekend, so let the fun begin!  
Also, Keith mentioned a possible trip to the poconos!  His stepfather owns a vacation house up there, not far from Camelback Mountain.  We were inititally thinking of going up the 2nd weekend in March, for some skiing, snowtubing, and lots of drinking.  Should be a blast!  Though now the weekend might be in question, because Dale might be receiving a promotion at work, which would completely change his work schedule... again!
I'm super proud of Dale.  I know he's worked really hard for this, and he well deserves it.  I just hope that he gets it, and that he's happy with it.  Hopefully it will mean a raise in pay too. ;-)
Things with Dale have been really good lately.  We've managed to work out some issues successfully, though there is one big one left to deal with.  The whole question of moving in vs. getting married.  I've tried to talk to him about it a few times.  He was kind of receptive the first time, but since then hasn't really wanted to talk about it.  I would like to discuss it more, but I'm getting nowhere.  And honestly I'm a bit frustrated. :-/
But I guess all is well, since I have a warm, fuzzy kitty snuggling in my lap.  Buddy's been super affectionate tonight, and I'm loving it!
Valentine's day is coming up soon... I've decided that since I'm pretty poor at the moment, that I would just make Dale a really nice dinner.  Candlelight included. ;-)  I hope he's not disappointed, I just can't afford to get him something that he would actually want, and I kind of hate the materialistic quality of the ""holiday"" anyway.
But it's getting really late and I'm sleepy... so Jackee, here's your entry.  Enjoy!"

"event","Today was the day to hang up new lighting in my house.  My parents came over, helped me out, and 4 new light fixtures in total were installed.

1. Ceiling fan in my bedroom--The one that was there was awful, this horrible peach color.  I took a white ceiling fan with beautiful tiffany globes from my parent's house, and my dad and I switched them out.  The old fan is in the garbage!

2. New chandelier in the dining room--The old one was awful gold with tons of crystals and beads hanging off it.  Way too gaudy and old-ladyish for me.  Bought a new one at home depot.  It's brushed nickel with white swirled glass globes.  Modern, sleek, very me.  It looks awesome.  The old one is going to my co-worker Brooke.  She thinks it's beautiful and it going to hang it in her house.  I guess to each their own.

3. New light in the foyer--The old one was a funky lantern, brass finish.  Not horrible, could have stayed except that it now clashed with the beautiful nickel chandelier in the dining room.  So I got a flush-mount light with the same glass and nickel finish as the dining room.  I coordinate so well. :-p

4. New light above the kitchen table--The old one was dark and had fruit painted on the glass.  Enough said.  The new one is awesome.  It's a set of 3 pendant lights (black finish on the hardware) with beautiful green and yellow globes.  Very modern, and totally awesome looking.

I am totally psyched about all of my new lights.  With every project like this I do, I feel more and more that this is MY house.  I'm doing what *I* want, and everything reflects my taste.  Great feeling.
I just wish there were more time this weekend for me to actually get the bathroom painted.  It's all prepped, everything taken down, cleared out, spackled like 10 million times, but I'm exhausted and can't get to painting tonight.  Maybe I can prime a bit tomorrow night, and start working on some trim work.  Or I can spray paint the frame for the mirror on the medicine cabinet.  I also need to spray paint the handles from the ""cabinet of death"" that goes above the toilet.
Anyway, I'm done rambling.  I'm going to go veg. :-)"

Jenn has asked me to be Katie's godmother!  There was some controversy at first as to whether I could do it or not, being that I'm not a confirmed Catholic.  I was baptized and had my first communion, but never got confirmed... After some discussion with the priest, it was decided that as long as one of the godparents is a practicing Catholic, the other can be pretty much anything other than a Jew.  And I think I qualify for that.
I think the Catholic church is ridiculous for a number of reasons, but I'm glad to have an ""official"" role in Katie's life.  Now I can officially be ""Aunt Sharon"". :-)  Yay!"

"event","Ok, so I decided to strip the wallpaper border down in my bathroom. (and eventually in like EVERY other room in the house...)  This was supposed to be an easy undertaking.  I figured I would start small, just the little border in my bathroom, let me test out my skills in removal, test the chemical and technique and all that, before moving on to the huge task of stripping the wallpaper in the hall bath (which has EVERY surface, even the ceiling, covered in ugly nasty old paper).
Well, it's been two evenings of working on this, and I have managed to strip the wallpaper from the area above the shower stall.  That's it, not over the sink, not over the window, not over the door, and definitely not over the toilet.  Just the stall.  Based on this rate of progression, I should be done in oh, say 2 more weeks.  With the border!!!  Not even the whole wall!!!  I'm scared to think how insanely long it's going to take to do the other bathroom.  Frightened.  Terrified.
I HATE Wallpaper.  I will NEVER put it up anywhere else in my house, EVER.  I advise you all to do the same."

Financially I'm in a hole... I'm getting sucked dry from little stuff (not to mention christmas!)  My cat got the stomach flu Dale had over Christmas and had the runs all week.  I ended up taking him to the vet the other night because he was crying in the box... poor guy.  They gave him some medicine, some fluids and sent me home with some medicine I need to stuff down his throat.  Not a happy kitty.  And not a happy mommy, cuz it cost $193!!!  I think I need to get vet insurance.  Anybody know anything about it?
Yesterday the ""check engine soon"" light came on in my car, so I'm taking it to get fixed this afternoon.  HOpefully that won't cost too much. :-(
My boss has been out sick all week, so I've been holding down the fort.  It's been so freaking boring though, cuz we're really slow in terms of patients right now.  At least I get to leave work early and futz around while I'm there.
Speaking of which, I should get back to work... :-p

But what I don't understand is why when I have SO many things to worry about at home (packing, schoolwork, money, signing up for my utilities, renting a moving truck, dealing with my nerves...) does work have to be crazy too?  This week has been the busiest at work in the last year.  Trying to make a whole new leg for a veteran from MD in 2 days, instead of taking the normal 3-4 weeks or more!  Plus all kinds of other ridiculous stress, like being told there will be no christmas bonuses this year because they can't afford it.  This is after they cut my dental insurance, and lowered our medical plans to crap.  Maybe if my boss showed up for more than 20 hours a week we'd be able to afford more...
ahh... the frustration level mounts.
Hopefully everything will subside after next week, and after I'm moved and settled into the new house.  Gotta hope so at least.

"event","After weeks of planning, my garage sale is almost here!  Tomorrow and sunday are the big days, after being completely rained out last weekend.  I have a TON of crap to sell.  I'm hoping at least some of it goes.  I'd love to make a bit of money off it to help with expenses at the new house.  Or at least get rid of all the crap I don't want anymore.  I'm not moving it, so either it gets sold, or it's trash.  I'd feel much better about myself, and much less wasteful if it finds a happy new home.
I've got a busy day tomorrow, before it even starts though!  I'm taking my car in for an oil change and a few minor repairs, so it needs to be at the shop at 8am.  Then my dad is going to bring me back home (2 minutes away), and I need to hang up all the signs for the garage sale!  I was going to do it tonight, but I don't want them to get ruined by the rain tonight.  If I get them out early enough in the morning, it shouldn't make a difference.  Then I need to get everything set up for the sale!  So much stuff to put out and organize.  Ugh.  I really hope all the work I'm putting into this will actually yield me a nice little profit.  Probably not, but I've got to hope.
And then I get to do it all again on sunday!  At least some of the stuff should be gone by then, and I'll have it all completely sorted by that point.
I'm hoping to see Dale tomorrow night.  I haven't seen him since last weekend because of the weather.  He's coming up to help me with the sale on sunday, and is working all day tomorrow, so I was thinking about going down to visit him.  But I also need to make sure I get enough sleep, since I need to work all next week too.  I don't know what I should do.  It would be much easier if he could just come up tomorrow night, hang out, and then stay over to help with the sale on sunday, but NOOOOOO that's not allowed in my house.  I'm SO glad I'm almost out of here.  He can stay at my new house anytime he wants.
Ok, bedtime now... got a LONG day tomorrow."

This is probably one of the hardest things I've ever done.  Definitely the most stressful.  I met with a lawyer today, after spending the past two days trying to find one.  She seems nice enough, but I have to trust that she knows what she is doing, because I have NO clue.  Everybody keeps trying to give me advice, help me out and calm me down, but I am seriously stressed out.  A bundle of nerves.  Not sleeping, not really eating, feeling nauseous most of the time.  I know I need to calm down, but I can't help it.  I think I'm going to keep a very low profile for the next couple of weeks until all this immediate legal stuff gets straightened out.  Then I just have to wait (and save up more money) until November for closing.  At which point I finally get to move in.

Saw War of the Worlds last night with my bf and a few other friends.
I went to work today.  Morristown then to Oakland in the afternoon.  Got to leave a little early, didn't hit *too* much traffic coming home.  I have a half day tomorrow, and then a 3-day weekend.
Dale won a trip to AC for tomorrow night from work.  Heading down on a ""party bus"" after work and coming home sometime in the wee hours.  Sounds fun.
He also won an all-expenses paid weekend in Vegas from work at the end of July.  Limo service to and from the airport and staying in a swanky hotel.  Congrats.  Don't know if I'll go.  It's the same weekend as Brooke and Steve's engagement party, though that isn't a huge concern.  It's mostly because Dale doesn't seem to care either way if I go or not.  Hasn't bothered to find out any of the specifics, nor attempted to help me find cheap airfare or offered up any money.  I'm tired of doing all the work.  I might just say fuck it and let him go by himself.  I don't want to be the only one putting effort into the relationship, so I might just stop for a while and see how he feels about that.
Talked to Roz tonight.  She's still sick and feeling crappy.  I wish there was something I could do to make her feel better.  I miss my best friend. :-(  Haven't seen her for a while.  Sleep is her main goal lately (which I completely understand), but during the few hours she's not sleeping she's trying to cram the rest of her life in.  Doesn't leave a whole lot of room for extra stuff, which includes me.
We're supposed to get ice cream and hang out for a little while tomorrow afternoon.  I'm super excited.
I don't know why I'm feeling so down.  Maybe I'm jealous of the cool trips Dale gets to go on.  Maybe I'm bummed about still not being able to get a house.  Maybe I'm missing my best friends (Roz=sick, Ushta=world-traveller, Jenn=pregnant and a south jersey hick).  Maybe I'm sick of the shit I get from my mother.  Maybe I'm tired of feeling like I'm the only one who gives a shit and puts some effort in.
Maybe I'm just crazy.  None of this stuff has bothered me this much before, I don't know why today is so special... fuck it, I'm going to bed."

"event","I think I just had the LONGEST weekend of my life.  Friday afternoon I flew to Chicago for a continuing education seminar for work.  It was an awesome class, but it was ALL day saturday and sunday.  And when I say ALL day, I mean ALLLLLL day.  Had to meet in the hotel lobby at 6:45 am each morning, meaning I had to get up at 5:45am each morning, and then didn't get back to my room until very late each night.  Saturday night I went shopping down Michigan Ave. with my new friend Lisa from Indiana.  Unfortunately, by the time we got out of class and all the way down there, all of the cool stores were closed.  I did manage to go to the gap and nordstroms, where I proceeded to buy stuff, including clothes and shoes.  And I quickly found out that Chicagoans are taxed up the ass.  I guess I'm lucky to live in Jersey where there's no tax on food or clothing.  In Illinois, there is 8 3/4% tax on EVERYTHING, and it adds up fast.
Sunday night we went to dinner at Fogo de Chao.  If you are ever in Chicago and you eat meat, you NEED to go there.  It was absoulutely amazing, and I think I'm still full from it.
Monday morning I had to get up at 6:45 to catch the van back to the airport for my flight, which was incredibly turbulent and upset my already hung-over stomach.  I always manage to get the seat next to some sort of freak of nature, and this flight was no exception.  Sitting at the gate, I saw a huge woman pass by dragging along a small toddler, less than 2 years old.  I thought to myself, boy I hope I don't have to sit next to her.  She boarded the plane way before me, so I figured I was safe.  When it's my turn to board, I walk down to my seat, 11D, and there's somebody already in it.  The round chic with the round kid are in my seat, BOTH of them.  She had never flown before and sat in the wrong seat, but of course she had the one next to me.  Her son proceeded to pee on her knee before take-off, and she changed him squished on the seat in between us.  During the duration of the flight she kept chatting my ear off, explaining various aspects of her life.  Let me tell you her story, or at least the KEY points.
She's probably a couple of years younger than me, early 20's, and lives in Omaha, Nebraska, where there's lots of prostitutes with AIDS.  She was on her way to Ecuador to live with her husband for 6 months, until he can get papers to get back into the US.  She's about 6 weeks pregnant, with her husband's baby.  The toddler in her lap, however, has a different daddy, who lives in Mexico now.  Oh, and there's a 3rd kid, a daughter, 5 years old.  She lives in Guatamala with HER father.  3 different babies with 3 different daddies.  This girl was probably close to 300 lbs, somebody please explain to me how she managed to get 3 different guys.  She met her husband, and married him 2 weeks later to keep him from moving back to Queens.  
Oh, and she's on a diet, taking some kind of diet pills.  She's lost 12 pounds in the last 3 weeks.  Supposedly drinking grapefruit juice all the times ""eats all the fat from inside your body""... so she's trying that too.  When she gets back from Ecuador, she's going to get her GED.  And then she wants to be a doctor, the kind that takes care of pregnant women.  Or a nurse, or nurse's assistant, or maybe an ultrasound person.  Anything having to do with pregnant women.  But she's not sure about the ultrasound person job, because for the first ultrasound you have to stick the ultrasound thing, you know, down there.  But wait, don't you have to stick your HAND down there if you want to be a doctor?
I think so far in my life, she is probably the dumbest person I have ever met.  Stupid enough to not even realize that she's too stupid to be a doctor.  I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but the more and more she kept talking AT me, the more I realized some people don't deserve it.  I just feel really bad for the kid.
I think the next time I'll be on a plane with be for vacation with Dale, so I'll make him sit next to the freak.  I've had more than my fair share, I get the super freaks, and I'm DONE."

That seems to be the story of my life.  I always say I want to do stuff, I think about it, ponder it, get distracted with other stuff, and then at some point down the road, I *might* get around to it.  Usually at the very last moment that is.  I know it's a horrible habit, and it probably annoys other people as much or even more than it annoys me.  I apologize.
Like tonight for example...  I have midterms next week, and at the start of the evening tonight, I still had 2 full classes to watch.  I watched about 45 minutes of class (slightly less than one class), in between putzing around and doing other stuff.  If I had been more motivated, I probably could have gotten both classes watched tonight, or at least one full one.  But that's not my style... I need to wait until this weekend to finish it all, before having a quiz and 2 midterms next week.  I think I'm a misery junkie.  I get high off worrying about how much work I have to do, instead of just sitting down and doing it.  Why is that?!  I don't get it.  I know I have this habit, so why can't I change it?  Maybe because I'm too busy procrastinating again and writing a livejournal entry... hrm.
Anyway, on a lighter note... my boss told me today that I'm first on line to get a raise once we get some more business in.  That's awesome, I just hope it comes through before I get around to buying a house, it will really help with that.  The more money, the better!  I'm really worried about possibly over-extending myself.  I have no idea how much stuff costs in real life.  Living in my parents house for the last 26 years has totally warped my sense of reality I think.
But I suppose if I'm not going to actually get work done, I should try to catch up on some sleep.  So, g'night!"

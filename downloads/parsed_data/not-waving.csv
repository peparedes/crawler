It's probably not the worst song ever written, but I'd have to be offered something mighty tempting like my entire student loans paid off in full to have to listen to James Blunt's ""You're Beautiful"" for an hour, let alone 24 of them. His voice grates on me so so much and the song is dreary."

"event","Hello, this is Nic/Nicola/Nicsi/Spookie I have changed my name from <b>_sleepflower</b> to <lj user=""not_waving"">. I've only changed the name - not gotten a new journal, I don't want to purge my past, as much of it is still my present. 
The name, in context of its origin, is pretty downbeat, but I like it. It also has Manics connotations, and I like that :)

Points if you can tell me where I got my name from. 
More points if you can tell me where the MANICS got it from...
(note: I got it from the original)

I'd like to take the opportunity to RE-FriendsOnly this journal. If you're not on my friends list, then all you'll wind up seeing are boring surveys, so...

Fucking hell, i know she used to be anorexic, hence no insulation on her, but that's just taking it a bit too far. Most i can handle in the winter is about 22-24 degrees. PUT A FUCKING JUMPER ON BEFORE BRITISH GAS SEND A SNIPER OUT ON YOU!"

"event","Yesterday, a guy I used to know quite well posted a picture on the Kerrang.com messageboards. This was a photograph taken of a few of us at Ozzfest 2002. I cried when I saw it. 

<img src=""http://www.faceparty.com/pb/152/images/pepparoo_1020423.jpg"">

The guy on the right is my friend Christopher Pyke. 
I've not seen him in two and a half years. When I last spoke to him, it was in the summer of 03 just before I left my dad's. He was living in a squat with some really dodgy characters, and taking a lot of substances. He wasn't taking care of himself, so ended up in hospital a lot due to his diabetes.

Then the calls stopped, and I couldn't get through on his phone. My good friend who comes from the same town, said he and his dad had moved away; he was just going to die if he stayed in that scene. 
Since he moved, no one has heard from him in our group of friends, and I don't know any of the druggies he was squatting with. His phone number is still inactive, and his email returns things that I send. 
I'm so scared that he went back to the scene, and died there. 
I'm so scared that someone who cared about me, and who I cared deeply for has lost himself. 
I just need to know that he's ok."

Your humor's mostly innocent and off-the-cuff, but somehow there's
something slightly menacing about you. Part of your humor is making
people a little uncomfortable, even if the things you say aren't
themselves confrontational. You probably have a very dry delivery, or
are seriously over-the-top.<br><br>Your type is the most  likely to appreciate a good insult and/or broken bone and/or very very fat person dancing.<br><br>

"event","1: Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says:
""Ut coniecturam faciam - necesse est tibi bibere...""

2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What are you touching?
Nothing. Nearly the wall.

3: What is the last thing you watched on TV?
Celebrity Big Brother.

4. What time is it WITHOUT LOOKING?
6.20 am.

5: Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?:
0622! WIN!

6: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?:
The fridge, and birds. 

7: When did you last step outside? what were you doing?:
I went to put money on my gas meter last night. About 8pm.

8: Before you came to this website, what did you look at?:
I was watching Spaced. 

9: What are you wearing?:
PJ bottoms, odd socks, bra, Zim shirt, zip up hoodie.

10: Did you dream last night?:
Yes. I dreamt I stabbed someone with a stonefish.

11: When did you last laugh?
Watching Withnail&I earlier on.

12: What is on the walls of the room you are in?:
10 posters, 6 framed pieces, a calendar, some photographs, a clock, a plastic aquarium, and some graffiti. It's my living room.

Nothing too exceptional. Arnie's lip looks odd.

14: What do you think of this quiz?:
Bit short, by the looks of things.

15: What is the last film you saw?:
Withnail&I. And we still didn't finish it!

17: Tell me something about you that I don't know:
I stutter. 

18: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you change?
Probably the US presence in Iraq. Save them the embarrassment of eventually pulling their troops out.

Imogen.

21: Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?:

"event","I called my mum tonight, to chat about exam stress and stuff. 
The phone beeped, and a voice I didn't recognise answered. 
Jaimie. My stepbrother. 
We had a brief ""hello, how are you""-like conversation. 

I've not seen him since I was 10. It feels sort of weird, knowing that he's in my place over there. I can't picture the house with any outside forces in it. It's my mother's castle. Her impenetrable, pristine fortress.

I really hope I can afford a plane ticket this Spring. This will be interesting to see; the change in family dynamic. 
I can't believe how much of an outsider I feel to this sometimes."

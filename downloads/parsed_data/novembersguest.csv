"event","This is me trying to break my paralyzing stasis here by apologizing profusely for never personally responding to each lovely comment left on my last few posts. The only explanation I have to give is: 1) I didn&#39;t feel like talking much at the time and, 2) It took too much of me to formulate any words that I felt would be appropriate and of equal measure to the kind emotion being extended to me....and, as result, I became stuck in silence.

I do want to start making some updates soon, starting with sharing the transformation of my classroom and a brief update on my dad--but I knew I could never do any of that without first apologizing. I hope to pull myself up by the bootstraps long enough to respond to some of the messages still left abandoned on my prior posts. I hope, I hope, I hope.

Its so hard, once inertia has set in, to get the ball rolling uphill again and, while I&#39;m doing okay emotionally, physically I am (and stay) utterly exhausted. I don&#39;t know why that is, just that it is. But, I <i>am</i> trying. Okay? Okay. Much love and gratitude to you all. Each one of you has been missed."

"event","So, Dad has stage four lung cancer, which isn&#39;t curable. He is not a surgical candidate, but they want to try to do chemo in order to slow the cancer down. The doctor says he will probably live about six more months without treatment and maybe nine months with treatment. So, not a good prognosis.

Dad&#39;s been back in the hospital the last couple of days with pneumonia (which I think is common with lung cancer) and possible congestive heart failure. The doctor does not want to say for sure if he has the CHF until the pneumonia is cleared up because they can&#39;t be sure how much of his symptoms are a result of the pneumonia. He was supposed to go for his first chemo treatment on Monday, but that has to be rescheduled until he is well. We&#39;re hoping he can come home tomorrow. Last week he had to go up to the hospital to have fluid drained away from his lungs--which is something he may have to have done again from now on.

Dad&#39;s been quiet since his diagnosis. I really think he believed it was going to be okay, that it wasn&#39;t cancer or that it would not be so bad and I think its been hard for him to adjust to just how bad it is. Neither he or my mom know about the specific time predictions, but I&#39;m sure they understand that stage four cancer is not good. The difference in my dad in the last two weeks has been very noticeable. He just looks sad and exhausted, doesn&#39;t seem interested in anything. His appetite isn&#39;t good and he sleeps a lot. With him being sick, its hard to tell if he&#39;s just been feeling bad or if he&#39;s depressed, but its really hard to see this happening to him and imagining how he must feel.

Anyway, that&#39;s what&#39;s going on and that&#39;s why I&#39;m not talking much. Don&#39;t really feel like talking and I don&#39;t really care about fandom things right now. I don&#39;t know if or when that&#39;ll change, but I don&#39;t foresee anything different for the time being. I&#39;m not angry or anything, but I&#39;m sad, stressed, overwhelmed and I don&#39;t know how to process this. The idea that this most likely will be my dad&#39;s last summer, last Father&#39;s Day, last everything that happens, hangs over my head all the time. My dad loves summer--loves his garden, loves fishing, etc. It sucks that he&#39;s been too sick recently to enjoy those things one last time. I really hope he perks up once the pneumonia is gone.

My mom can bearly hear anything right now and phone calls from the doctor&#39;s office send her into an outer orbit of panic (she can&#39;t understand anything over the phone). I don&#39;t know why this is THE thing that really gets her going, but it is. She&#39;s supposed to get her hearing aids fixed soon, so hopefully that helps because I can&#39;t keep doing weekly freak outs. Of course, we&#39;ve been busy, too. We&#39;ve been working on my classroom, taking care of things for my mom, running to the hospital (which is an hour away), and stuff like that.

I wasn&#39;t able to get a ride to the hospital today to visit Dad (we don&#39;t trust my car to go that far), so we went for a slow drive on the back roads and that helped for a while. It felt good to feel happy in the moment for just a little bit. I wish so hard, with every fiber of my being that we could move into the country (well, even more country than our rural small town). Nature helps me to find my center and feel calm--something I need very badly right now. We saw some deer, a turkey, a mama pig with some piglets and a bunch of rabbits. Of course, I talked to all the cows close enough to the road because they always look at you like they&#39;re actually listening, lol. Big ol&#39; brown eyes looking so curious and sincere. Anyway.

Apologies for all replies I haven&#39;t responded to, but know I do read and appreciate all of you (as always)."

"event","Sorry I&#39;ve not gotten the replies sent out on everything, but I&#39;m doing what I do best and that means just kinda freezing up on all social interaction. They did a biopsy on a spot they found on Dad&#39;s lung yesterday. Today they told us it was confirmed as cancer. I don&#39;t know how bad the situation is, only that it is confirmed as cancer. He&#39;s supposed to have an appointment on Tuesday to go over treatment plans.

My dad actually seems to be feeling fine and is in good humor. Since they&#39;ve increased his blood thinner, the knot under his arm and the swelling of his arm has gone down and it&rsquo;s no longer hurting him. I guess they&#39;re hoping the blood thinner will dissolve the clot before any more pieces can break off. *crosses fingers* Mostly, they seem to be focused on the cancer more than the blood clot.

I honestly don&#39;t know how I&#39;m feeling right now because it seems like this entire week has just been one, long waiting game. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time at the hospital so I&#39;ve been missing being home with my own family (there&#39;s not enough room for all of us to catch a ride up and our car isn&#39;t trustworthy enough to make the drive). I think I&#39;m starting to get depressed due to the stressfulness of all of it. The situation is stressful enough, but dealing with everyone else&#39;s stress and idiosyncrasies has also been extremely stressful since I&#39;m super sensitive to that kind of thing. It&#39;s like I can almost feel my blood pressure rising due to the continuing stress.

A part of me is kinda angry too. It&#39;s selfish, I know, but I&#39;m just so sick of every time I feel like I&#39;m about to get a reprieve and like maybe I&#39;m physically feeling better myself, about to get life back on track, something comes along and crushes those happy feelings and sends me into a new setback.

Anyway, I&rsquo;d like to thank all of you for your thoughts, kind words and prayers. I appreciate it so, so much. My dad is mostly being a trooper, but my mom is stressing herself and all of us out. She&rsquo;s the uptight type anyway and you can practically feel the anxiety rolling off of her right now.

She&rsquo;s been in some denial about how bad this could be, but she&rsquo;s also worrying about all the different things a person in her place would worry about&mdash;how to deal with Dad if he doesn&rsquo;t want treatment, how to deal with Dad if he has treatment but it makes him really sick, how to deal with making him behave himself and, of course, she worries about how much all this will end up costing. So they both need healing and supportive prayers.

*hugs* to you all and thank you so much again."

"event","Hi everyone, I know I&#39;ve been absent quite a bit once again, but the end of the school year and getting my stuff boxed up and moved from the middle school over to the high school took a lot of time and effort (and I&#39;m still not done even though school finished up last week). But, I come to you for a personal request. If you believe, I&#39;d sure appreciate your prayers for my dad and my family.

Sunday afternoon he had a TIA while we were all there for dinner. For those who don&#39;t know, a TIA is a often called a mini-stroke, but what is actually a warning stroke. They don&#39;t have any lasting effects, but they warn of the danger of a major stroke coming. We took him to a local hospital where he was then transferred to the big hospital in Joplin. They&#39;ve done an ultrasound of his arm and found a big blood clot running from just under his arm up to his jugular vein.

They called in a specialist who says they don&#39;t plan to remove it because its old and is not as much of a danger as if it was new. The really bad thing is that they seem more concerned about this spot they found under his arm that has caused the blood clot. That and they&#39;ve found a spot on his lungs. I don&#39;t know how bad it is because my mom is refusing to talk about it until we all get up there this evening, but I&#39;m thinking the news is pretty bad. Otherwise, she&#39;d surely just tell us on the phone. Since I&#39;m expecting bad news, I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be back around and I don&#39;t know what exactly to ask prayers for, but I just wanted to let you all know what&#39;s going on and ask you to keep us all in mind when you pray.

My family is a really close family--we all live within 15 minutes of each other and we all come to my parents every Sunday to eat. We&#39;ve all always depended on our dad for so much in life. He&#39;s always been the one we go to for any project around the house, lawn mower repairs, electrical repairs...just all those kinds of things. My dad&#39;s a really smart guy and he&#39;s always been good at that kind of thing. He also always puts out a big garden every summer and shares the food from it. It&#39;s usually a big part of our Sunday family dinners during the growing season. Not only that, but he&#39;s just always been there to help his kids out any way he could. I don&#39;t know how to express how much we all rely on and love him and how much our lives will change if something happens to him.

I know we all have to let go of our aging parents at some point, but I also know I&#39;ll never be ready. Not ever.

Thanks in advance for your well-wishes and prayers. Like I said, I don&#39;t really know when I&#39;ll be back around--it depends on how bad the news turns out to be. I&#39;m really hoping we&#39;ll get up there and it won&#39;t be as bad as all this, but I just don&#39;t know.

*hugs* to you all."

"event","Wow, y&#39;all, I totally broke my posting streak. :(

What can I say? It was a really, really busy week last week fraught with mucho stress-o-rama. Then, I caught a lovely stomach bug over the weekend, missed my great-niece&#39;s birthday because of it and generally felt miserable. Sipped on my gingerale and some Pepto, had a little soup and slept or watched TV--that was my weekend. Today we started state testing at our school and this is our first year to do it online--which meant mucho-mucho stress-o-rama because, of course, nothing worked right. *sigh*

So, I&#39;ve got some catching up to do with everyone, but I don&#39;t know when. I hope I&#39;ll start feeling better soon because I really want to turn over a new leaf and keep myself a little more up-to-date...and I still got that other chapter that&#39;s waiting for me to finish up the edits.

Did I mention the ants got to my chocolate chip cookies within two hours of them being put--unopened--into the cabinet? No, yum, yummies for me.

"event","For a little while now, I &#39;ve had two personal e-mail accounts--a Yahoo account and an Outlook account my Windows 8.1 insisted on. Those of you who know me well, know I kinda suck at keeping up with things--I&#39;m horribly scattered--so obviously that wasn&#39;t working out so well. So, I combined them. I now have all of my Yahoo mail forwarded to my Outlook account so I only have ONE personal e-mail account to check (not including my work e-mail).

Anyway. I decided now that I have the two accounts combined, it was time to go through the accumulated e-mail and do some &quot;spring cleaning.&quot; Ugh. I&#39;m so horribly embarrassed and ashamed of all the reviews and LJ comments I&#39;ve never replied to! I had NO idea I was this far behind. I&#39;ve gone through and answered some, but I wanted to make a post to apologize one more time for the lack of response on my part. I keep telling myself every time I get caught up that I will never let it get out of control again...and, yet, it always does. *hangs head in failure* My most sincere regrets on that.

In other news, I&#39;ve decided to make Mother&#39;s Day gifts for my mom, sister and oldest niece. As I mentioned in an earlier post, I&#39;ve gotten into the essential oils--what I didn&#39;t meniton is my new interest in Pinterest and all the DIY projects there. I ordered the stuff I&#39;ll need and plan on making body butter, bath fizzies and sugar scrub for the hands.

I think for the body butter, I&#39;ll scent it with an essential oil blend that is especially for calming and helping with stress. I thought it would be nice to use before bedtime. For the bath fizzies, I think I&#39;ll use lavendar for my mom and niece and something blended for tranquilty for my sister (she thinks she might be allergic to lavender). For the sugar scrub, I haven&#39;t really decided, but I was thinking about adding lemon so they can keep it in the kitchen to use. I thought the lemon would help neutralize any bad sents on their hands from cooking jobs. I hope it all turns out well and it ends up being something they can really use and enjoy. It doesn&#39;t sound hard to make any of it and I found a good deal on Ball jelly jars to store the body butter and scrub.

Wish me luck on my DIY projects. Hope you all have a great week!"

Her apartment was really an old, two-story house with outside access to each level, the kitchen being shared with the people upstairs who never seemed to be around. Her living area took up most of the bottom floor and had a small space for parking around the back of the house where the familiar black car was currently rolling to a stop. This was a good thing since they&#39;d be able to come and go from the house without disturbing or being disturbed.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""></p><lj-cut><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">It felt like hours since Chris had called, but it hadn&#39;t been but a matter of minutes. Chris hadn&#39;t given a lot of detail, so she wasn&#39;t sure what to expect, but she knew Dean wouldn&#39;t seek her out unless it was serious. She&#39;d never heard Chris sound so freaked. That alone was enough to put her on alert. He was the calm one that always knew how to command a situation.

Chris came through behind her and gently eased Dean down onto her bed. When he straightened back up, his shoulder was stained with Dean&#39;s blood&mdash;it blackened the front of his shirt and dried streaks smeared his jeans. Immediately, her eyes flew over Dean&#39;s body, evaluating the seriousness of the blood loss.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">Crawling onto the bed next to him, she began stripping his coat and outer shirt off as she called, &quot;Dean. Wake up.&quot; When he didn&#39;t respond, she shook him gently and called to him again. Still nothing. She raked her knuckles up and down his sternum to see if he&#39;d respond to pain and was relieved when he grimaced a little.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">&quot;Okay, can we talk about why he&#39;s not at a hospital right now?&quot; She questioned as she peeled back his t-shirt to check the wounds on his chest. She quickly bunched up the shirt she had removed and pressed it into the lacerations, bearing down. Wondering why she wasn&#39;t getting an answer, she shot a look over her shoulder at Chris and faltered at the expression on his face. His eyes dragged from Dean to her and then back again.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">&quot;He made me promise I wouldn&#39;t. He <em>said</em> it wasn&#39;t that bad, that he just needed rest&mdash;mumbled something about it not being real. He made me promise I wouldn&#39;t,&quot; he repeated, helplessly. His soiled shirt hung forgotten in his limp fingers where he&#39;d stripped it off.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">Lori shifted the bloody compress aside. The oozing blood looked to be slowing enough to begin stitching, which was a good sign. She pressed the wadded up shirt back in place, ran a shaky hand under her nose and stood part way up to lend more weight to the compression. &quot;He&#39;s unconscious, Chris&mdash;isn&#39;t responding to anything but more pain and his breathing is too fast. How bad does it need to be?!&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">Chris&#39;s face contorted and he growled, &quot;I did what he asked.

I&#39;ve gotta go see what kind of supplies I&#39;ve got with me.&quot; By the time her arms were loaded with everything she thought she might need, Chris had already discarded a soaked towel and was bearing down on the remaining towels covering Dean&#39;s wounds.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">&quot;Lucky for us, I have some supplies,&quot; she said, throwing everything onto the bed. &quot;First thing we need to do is clean the wounds and get them stitched. Start talking while we work. Tell me everything that happened so I&#39;ll know what we&#39;re dealing with. I need to know how long he&#39;s been out, how he got his injuries, things like that.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">Chris nodded once, sharply. &quot;Just tell me what to do and I&#39;ll help.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">And that was the part of Chris she loved. He could be counted on in a pinch. Leaving him to keep the pressure on a little longer, she drew a big bowl of warm water and cleared a spot for it on her nightstand, knocking her alarm clock to the floor. Setting up her supplies and sterilizing what she&#39;d need, she worked quickly and efficiently, letting instinct take over as she cut Dean&#39;s shredded t-shirt from his body. The bare skin was burned pink&mdash;nothing life threatening&mdash;but she wasn&#39;t sure if it was new or leftover from last time. Carefully, she removed his necklace and set it aside.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">As she cleaned away the blood, she noticed Chris had become too quiet again.

She remembered her own shock when she&#39;d first seen them herself. &quot;He&#39;s got a lot of them, doesn&#39;t he? Considering what he does, it&#39;s not really a surprise, is it?&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">&quot;I guess I hadn&#39;t really thought about it,&quot; Chris said weakly.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">&quot;I don&#39;t imagine this life&#39;s easy.

Of course, there is the blood loss and head injuries are sometimes tricky no matter how mild.

He pulled a hand across the back of his neck. &quot;I mean, he&#39;s not&mdash;it&#39;s not a coma like Aaron?&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">Lori laid a hand on Dean&#39;s arm, just resting her fingers lightly on his skin for the contact. &quot;Any person who doesn&#39;t respond normally to stimuli for a prolonged period can be considered in a coma&mdash;but, no, probably not like Aaron.

If he loves him so much, why doesn&#39;t he cut him loose, send him back to school where he belongs instead of letting him waste his life like this? It&#39;s not safe, obviously.

He has issues, you know.&quot; Dean didn&#39;t respond to anything she&#39;d said and she let her eyes roam over his face, wondering what was happening behind his closed eyes. &quot;C&#39;mon, Dean. Come back from wherever you are. Please. No matter what that idiot thinks, I know Sam needs you, even if it doesn&#39;t always show. And I&#39;ve made my own promises. You have to be okay. Okay?&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">As she watched him, his eyes moved rapidly under his closed lids. She shook her head and frowned. If Dean was actively dreaming, this was no common unconsciousness. She brushed a thumb over the freckles littering his eyelid. &quot;What are you seeing? Why won&#39;t you wake up?&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">Freckles, like mushrooms, seemed to pop up in the oddest places across his face. She smiled to herself. &quot;How can someone so bullheaded have so many freckles? I&#39;m sorry to bring it to your attention, buddy, but it really puts a dent in your tough-guy image.&quot; At the lack of response, she muttered. &quot;Well, guess I&#39;d better get comfy.

He exhaled, fully expecting to see a cloud of frozen vapor appear&mdash;but it didn&#39;t. Instead, the coldness was deep in the center of him&mdash;<em>his</em> insides frozen. Confusion at finding himself still stuck to the ceiling made him reevaluate what he remembered happening. He thought it was over, he thought she&#39;d let him go&mdash;but here he was, pinned like a butterfly. Only now, he was alone in pitch black&mdash;bizarre given how the room was always gray-washed by some kind of ambient light source. Searching the inky darkness below, he tried to pick out the bed that should be right under him&mdash;but there wasn&#39;t even enough light to do that.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">A sickening burn sliced through the layers of his abdomen and it throbbed the moment air hit it. His skin tingled, pinched all over with a growing intensity that transitioned into agony. As it began to torment, he began to <em>ignite</em>. His incandescence illuminated the bed below and the person stretched across it. Dean&#39;s chest panged as panic tripped through him. Sam. It was Sam lying beneath him, red drops of blood dotting his forehead. Sam&#39;s eyes opened to look up and Dean&#39;s body burst into flames.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">A desperate &quot;No!&quot; ripped from Dean&#39;s throat, his eyes locked on the horror twisting his little brother&#39;s face. How was it possible to hear Sam&#39;s cries over sizzling skin and the roaring fire consuming him? The wretched stench of burning hair, the sharp smell of ash floating all around him, filled his nostrils&mdash;the pain indescribable. Below him, Sam was catching fire from the sloughing of Dean&#39;s clothing and skin, his screams joining Dean&#39;s though he made no move to get away. There was no one to rescue him this time.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">Sam shouted, &quot;No! No! Please, no!&quot; Over and over again until Dean ached with <em>please, no</em>. His brother was dying horrifically beneath him as he burned without end and he just couldn&#39;t pass out, could not escape. He wished for it to be over quick, for Sam and then for himself.

I&#39;ve had this chapter ready to post for several months, but I wanted to get the next one ready to go so you all wouldn&#39;t kill me for leaving you on a cliffy. Actually, my friend,<lj user=""gaelicspirit"" /> (who I want to thank for looking at this chapter long, long ago) was the one who warned&nbsp;me I&#39;d better not leave you all to suffer from a big delay between these two chapters. :)  

Also, I want to thank </strong><lj user=""Sodakey"" /><strong> for beta reading it&nbsp;for me and helping me to improve it in many, many ways. I&#39;m ever so grateful for her edits and her advice.

In fact, I want you to know that the main reason this story is continuing despite the marathon of writerly torture its become is because of those of you who leave reviews and send me private messages encouraging me to keep going. Part of it is my determination to finish the thing, but even that gets bogged down in despair at times. So, thank you from the bottom of my heart for lifting me up with your kind words.

The cool air and steady, familiar vibrations helped clear the cobwebs clinging to his mind. He readjusted his grip on the steering wheel, alarmed at the weakness consuming him, bone and marrow. The encounter with Jessica had hit him hard.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">He turned up the volume of the music playing through the Impala&#39;s speakers&mdash;purposely loud enough to prevent conversation. He really wasn&#39;t interested in anything Chris had to say anyway. Truth be told, Chris likely felt the same given the current verbal cease fire. Maybe acting like an ass had finally used up all his energy.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Dean was just grateful for the stillness the music provided his overtaxed brain.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">When the apartment building appeared in front of them, it was too soon. Dean thumbed the corner of his mouth as he parked and climbed out, gesturing for Chris to join him at the back of the car. Lifting the trunk lid, he grabbed his green duffel and began holding things up, explaining as he packed.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;See these shells?&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;I know, salt-loaded.

Iron works as good as salt in a pinch.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Chris nodded as he took it.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;And take this.&quot; Dean held out a wicked looking silver knife. &quot;I&#39;m not completely convinced this is a ghost problem. A few things we can try if it isn&#39;t&mdash;silver and holy water.&quot; Dean threw a bottle of what looked like ordinary water into the bag. Reaching deep into the back, he pulled out an old sawed-off and tossed it to Chris. &quot;This is Sam&#39;s. It&#39;s old and he doesn&#39;t use it much, but if you damage it, he will be pissed&mdash;at both of us.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">He grabbed his own shotgun, shouldered the duffel and slammed the lid shut, hand lingering on the warm metal a few precious seconds. Pocketing the keys, he turned and said, &quot;You sure you want to do this? Not too late to change your mind.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Chris met Dean&#39;s gaze. &quot;I&#39;m no coward. Whatever you can take, so can I.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Dean snorted as he shook his head. &quot;Alright then, let&#39;s go.&quot; He walked away without checking to see if Chris followed&mdash;sometimes, fake confidence was better than nothing, the rest he&#39;d borrow with interest.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">They made it halfway up the staircase before the first wave of disorientation washed through him. He paused mid-step. Gripping the banister, he waited for his equilibrium to return, eyes fixed resolutely ahead. Uncharacteristically, Chris said nothing&mdash;didn&#39;t even sigh&mdash;just waited quietly until Dean was able to go on.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">A cold sweat covered Dean from head to toe by the time they reached the floor of the apartment. His temples were damp with it and he had to work hard to control the tremors in his hands. This close to the apartment, he felt a subtle difference between here and the hospital. Much of it the same&mdash;but the resonance in his bones told him it was somehow different too.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">The feeling grew as he entered the room, increasing with every step toward ground zero. He stopped once he reached the bedroom doorway, one hand firmly fixed on the frame, head bent against the wash of manic energy zipping through him. Felt like a euphoric buzz, except dissonant and frenzied, an unpleasant itch crawling under his skin. He shivered.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Dropping his duffel to the inside-right of the room, he bent to rummage through it until he found the flashlight and clicked it on. Yellowed light cut through the dimness, revealing all was the same as when they&#39;d left&mdash;no sign there had been any fire at all, old or new. Over his shoulder, he said, &quot;Cover me, but stay close to the doorway. Don&#39;t come into the room if you can help it.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Chris nodded, raising the gun in both hands&mdash;if his grip was a little white-knuckled, well, Dean wouldn&#39;t begrudge the guy that much. Maybe there was some sense under the bravado after all.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Flashlight roving over the room, Dean searched for anything out of place. The nearby dresser was devoid of all but a thin layer of dust, but it was a good place to start. He pulled each drawer open swiftly. Each one was empty, nothing but lint and more dust inside.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Moving toward the closet, Dean faltered. His stomach clenched. Something <em>wrong</em>, a vague tingling of his senses, shivered through him. Forcefully, he twisted the knob and jerked the door wide open. Nothing.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Giving it a thorough once-over, he pushed aside the empty hangers and searched the corners of the floor. Still nothing. He grabbed the chair in the nook next to the closet and used it to climb up, shining his light along the top shelf. <em>Yahtzee!</em></span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Snugged up along the far left corner was a small, blackened locket. Dean stretched on his tip-toes and made a lunge for it, barely snagging the end of the chain. He quickly stuffed it in his coat pocket, needing both hands to ease down from the chair, head ringing as fresh dizziness swept through him in a whirl.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">His feet had just touched the floor when Chris warned, &quot;Dean.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Dean followed the direction of Chris&#39;s pointed gun. Familiar pressure ballooned against the backs of his eyes forcing him to grimace and squint at the light gathering in the center of the room. Keeping his legs stiff against the sudden jelly sensation, Dean stepped closer to Chris and dropped the flashlight, letting it bounce soundlessly on the carpet. Reaching a hand out to Chris, he waited for the cold confidence of his shotgun to settle against his palm. Before Chris had finished digging for the weapon, Jessica had fully formed in front of them. Chris froze as he stared up in astonishment. Here, in this place, she was strong enough to make her presence seen by anyone.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;Chris!&quot; Dean hissed. &quot;Shotgun!&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;Wait, you&#39;re not gonna shoot her!?&quot; It was half demand and half question, as Chris stood with Dean&#39;s weapon clutched tight.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;If she tries anything, damn right I will!&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;I won&#39;t let you hurt her!&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Dean&#39;s eyes snapped to glare at Chris. &quot;She&#39;s already dead and I like my hide intact,&quot; he growled, trying to snatch the weapon away from Chris.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Chris glared back, keeping a firm grip and yanking back. &quot;Doesn&#39;t mean&mdash;&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;Dean,&quot; Jessica said, the syllables not all quite there, but clear enough to be understood. &quot;Please.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Giving up the fight over the weapon, Dean turned to Jessica, swallowing against the unbearable sadness she pushed into him.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;You&#39;re not the one who&#39;s been hurting people. Am I right?&quot; <em>Always go with your gut, son,</em> echoed in his ears.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Jess shook her head from side to side. &quot;It&#39;s&hellip; me&hellip;&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Which, okay, that wasn&#39;t altogether clear. &quot;Jessica, I want to help you, but I don&#39;t&mdash;ahh!&quot; Dean doubled over when she suddenly appeared two feet in front of him. Pressing an arm against an aching throb in his stomach, Dean struggled to keep his feet. &quot;Please. I want to help,&quot; he grit out. Groaning, Dean ducked his head when another bolt of pressure lanced his skull.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;Look!&quot; she whispered.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;Wh-what should I do?!&quot; Chris stammered from beside him.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;Shoot her!&quot; Dean pushed between his lips, trying not to pass out. &quot;Oh, God,&quot; he moaned even as he turned his head to where Jessica was pointing. Behind Chris, a black shadow appeared, one long arm stretching toward him. The interior space was too dark to make out much more than a flash of yellow eyes and filthy claws.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;Chris!&quot; Dean cried, &quot;Behind you!&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Chris twisted to look behind him, lifting the gun seconds too late. The weapon ripped from his hands and flew out of the room. The duffel followed, sliding across the floor until it came to rest somewhere in the living room. The bedroom window behind them banged open, wind tossing the curtains in gales that whipped at their clothes and hair. Dean yanked Chris out of the way just as the creature&#39;s arm slashed down, claws raking across Dean&#39;s chest in deep furrows. He cried out, the burning shock barely settling in before Jessica threw one hand out toward the shadow and one hand toward Dean. The room motion-blurred around him, pain exploding as his back crashed against the wall, his head bouncing hard against the plaster.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Dean felt himself slide up the wall, out of reach of whatever was still inside the doorway. The shadow was also stuck fast in its tracks.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;Jessica!&quot; Dean yelled. But she paid him no attention and his body continued to slide up until he was pinned to the ceiling&mdash;just like Jess had been when he&#39;d saved Sam a second time from fire.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Just like his mom before that.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Below him, Chris cowered in the corner by the dresser, whipping his wide, disbelieving eyes between Dean and the thing in the doorway and Jessica. The boy looked ready to keel over if someone so much as yelled boo at him. Obviously no help coming from that direction. A gust of unnaturally cold wind blew the shadow out of the room as the door slammed shut and shook on its hinges. The door continued to rattle and bang and the wind grew in angry intensity.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Jessica turned, then winked out mid-motion. &quot;Listen!&quot; she demanded, re-materializing beneath him, with the ceiling against his back and Jessica floating parallel to his front. She placed both hands on his head, her eyes bore into his even as <em>his</em> body burst into flame. Blood dripped from his wounds, falling straight through her to the bed below. Fire engulfed them both, and, though it hurt, and he could hear himself cry out, he had enough presence of mind to know it wasn&#39;t physical. His clothes did not melt, his hair did not singe.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Jessica caressed his cheek, then spoke, &quot;It&#39;s not me. But I am bound. They will all die if you don&#39;t stop it.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Black haze blurred Dean&#39;s vision, but he widened his eyes, forcing himself to stay awake. Forcing his lips to move, he asked, &quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Jessica shook her head. &quot;Very angry and very old. It feeds on them. You must break the bond, Dean. Let me rest, save my friends.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">A single tear washed down her cheek and she flickered. Then, like a switch being thrown, she was gone and he was falling. His body bounced roughly on the bed below, the haze taking over his vision completely. The next thing he knew, Chris was turning him onto his back and leaning over him.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;Oh God, you&#39;re bleeding!&quot; Chris was panicking. Dean could hear it in his voice&mdash;could see it in the kid&#39;s white face. He was punching at his cell phone with a thumb, saying, &quot;Hang on, just hang on.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Dean grabbed the arm that held the phone, grunting when his wounds pulled. &quot;No,&quot; he whispered through his teeth. &quot;No. Please.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Shocked, Chris stuttered, &quot;Y-you need a hospital&mdash;your chest is ripped open!

Reaching up, he gathered a handful of Chris&#39;s shirt and yanked him closer.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;Promise me.

Finally, he could close his eyes. He was so tired. Snatches of Chris&#39;s voice faded in and out&mdash;but not much penetrated the buzzing in his head.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;&hellip;he said you&#39;d know&hellip;.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;&hellip;be ready&hellip;ten tops&hellip;&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;Man, you&#39;re heavy&hellip;&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;...keys, keys, where are the damn keys?&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;Almost there, keep your eyes open&hellip;Dean!&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">He tried to obey the words, he really did&mdash;but the pull of unconsciousness felt too right.

A nurse had come and taken Becky and Nathan back to see Aaron, leaving Sam alone with his thoughts. His mind replayed events from earlier in a loop, his brain sorting through all that had happened. He tried not to worry, but Dean was scaring him. Sam couldn&#39;t put his finger on it exactly, but there was something going on he felt like he should be seeing but didn&#39;t. It was a nagging feeling that left him irritated &ndash; an itch he couldn&#39;t scratch.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Tired of pacing the same fifteen feet, he slumped into the chair across from the doorway. Families shuffled by, some looking worn out and others relieved and still others bored. People clad in different colored scrubs walked by discussing their day and laughing together. Sometimes someone would speed by in a white coat. Inside the waiting room, time was frozen&mdash;but out there, life went on. People went to work and took lunch breaks. Others left for their homes and some were just arriving. People moved. People breathed. Life moved forward.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Sam sighed, rubbing the pads of his fingers in circles at his temples. He thought about calling Dean&mdash;just to make sure he&#39;d made it back to their room okay. But every time he reached for his phone, the thought of Dean actually getting some sleep would stop him from carrying it through.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;Hey, you okay?&quot; Nathan&#39;s voice interrupted his thoughts.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Letting his hands slip down to rub his thighs, Sam nodded. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m good. Just been a really long day, ya know?&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;Tell me about it.&quot; Nathan took a seat across from him and leaned back with a yawn. &quot;It <em>has</em> been a long day. I think hospitals are caught in some weird time lag. Becky said you could come back, just give it a few minutes&mdash;the nurses were changing his sheets and she didn&#39;t think you or Aaron would enjoy that awkward moment.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Sam laughed lightly. &quot;No, not so much. How was he?&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Nathan&#39;s face sobered and he shrugged. &quot;He looks like he&#39;s sleeping.

Why is she hurting Dean? It doesn&#39;t make any sense.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Shrugging, Sam said, &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s intentional&mdash;just a side effect of the whole thing.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;But why him?

Remember the nightmares I told you about? Well, it&#39;s all a part of it.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;And she hasn&#39;t told you what she wants?&quot; Nathan whispered as a couple walked into the room.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;No. She&#39;s trying&mdash;but sometimes spirits have a hard time communicating.

Not really. I mean, why does it have to be us all the time? And you can&#39;t save everyone&hellip; no matter what we do, people die.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Nathan&#39;s jaw clenched. &quot;But you have to try, Sam. People&mdash;people don&#39;t know about all the darkness in the world. They don&#39;t know monsters are real&hellip; but you do. I mean, for every person you save, someone else doesn&#39;t have to grieve for them. Doesn&#39;t that make it worth it?&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">It hit Sam where Nathan was coming from and the guilt that rose up twisted his stomach sour. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Nathan.

But the short of it is, I wasn&#39;t in a good place when all that was going on&mdash;I was still so angry with my dad, with our way of life. Maybe I got too comfortable being <em>normal</em>. But, I swear, I didn&#39;t know what was happening until it was too late or I would&#39;ve tried.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Nathan smiled bitterly. &quot;Do you know what I would have given to talk about it with someone? I thought I was going crazy, Sam&hellip; and I couldn&#39;t talk about any of it because who would&#39;ve believed me? If only I had believed in <em>her</em>&mdash;but I didn&#39;t. I pretended not to see, pretended not to notice the weird things happening.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">&quot;You can&#39;t blame yourself.

I was too scared to tell anyone about myself&mdash;I just wanted to get as far away from that life as I could, especially after Jess and I got together.&quot;</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Nathan sniffed and rubbed at his eyes. &quot;Yeah, I get fear, I do.

[Verse 1]
She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Cetirizine, your fever&rsquo;s gripped me again
Never kisses, all you ever send are fullstops (la la la la)
Do you know where the wilds things go
They go along to take your honey (la la la la)
Break down, now weep,
Build up breakfast, now let&rsquo;s eat
My love, my love, love, love (la la la la)

[Hook]
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me, but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah &ndash; ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah

[Verse 2]
Do you know where the wilds things go
They go along to take your honey (la la la la)
Break down, now sleep,
Build up breakfast, now let&rsquo;s eat
My love, my love, love, love (la la la la)
She bruises, coughs, she splutters pistol shots
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
She&rsquo;s morphine, queen of my vaccine
My love, my love, love, love - la la la la

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Germolene, disinfect the scene
My love, my love, love, love
Please don&#39;t go, I love you so... My lovely

[Refrain](x2)
Please don&#39;t go, please don&#39;t go
I love you so, I love you so
Please don&#39;t go, please don&#39;t go
I love you so, I love you so
Please break my heart...

[Outro]
Please don&rsquo;t go, I&rsquo;ll eat you whole
I love you so [Repeated]"

Had some really good times here on LJ and made some cool friends, but I guess all things have their season. Still like being here more than Tumblr (minus the pretty pictures I find there)."

"event","It&#39;s weird how I went from radio silence for such a long time and then someone comes along and gently prods me into posting (thank you, dear friend, your interest in what&#39;s going on with me is appreciated) and I go nuts!

Anyway. I spent some time last night cleaning up my tags and links. I tried to simplify the tags so there are less of them. On the links, I updated them to include my most recent Tumblr addition, <b><a href=""http://mostly-dean.tumblr.com/"" target=""_blank"">Mostly-Dean</a> </b>(a gift url from Mostly-Jensen), and I changed some links that were really old and unnecessary.

At some point, I hope to get some time to go through my friends list and see who is actually still around--but today is not that day! :)"

"event","<i>If you&#39;re not writing, you&#39;re not a writer</i>.

I&#39;ve seen this quote often on various writing advice sites and it always makes me feel bad because I&#39;m <i>not</i> writing much--I&#39;m probably doing more editing than anything else. And, as you know, I have a lot of exuses I tell myself about why (<a href=""http://novembersguest.livejournal.com/155047.html"" target=""_blank""><u><b>some are legitimate</b></u></a>). Lately, the biggest excuse has been because I don&#39;t want to bother anyone about beta reading my work, but I also don&#39;t want to post with only my edits. Today, I read an article from The Write Practice titled &quot;<b><a href=""http://thewritepractice.com/not-writing/"" target=""_blank"">Why You&#39;re Not Writing</a></b>&quot; and realized that fear is the basic struggle behind most of my excuses. Fear. I read that and it resonated enough that I felt caught out.

I once took one of those Facebook quizzes about what was the primary emotion you lived your life by, or something to that effect, and mine was fear. Until I took that quiz, I had never really given it much thought, but, afterward, I started noticing that it was totally true. Fear is the main motivating factor in a lot of things I do or don&#39;t do. Fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of being hurt, fear of disappointment, fear of <i>being</i> a disappointment, fear of not being good enough, fear of being wrong, fear of being stuck in an endless rut--just fear everywhere.

So, I thought about how fear applies to my writing...or lack thereof. <i>One</i> of the reasons I haven&#39;t been getting my WIP updated in a timely fashion is because I don&#39;t want to be a burden on the couple of people who are willing to beta read for me. Both people are people I consider to be friends and both people are extremely busy with their jobs and whatever else real life is throwing at them. I mentioned this just this last weekend in my <a href=""http://novembersguest.livejournal.com/155335.html"" target=""_blank"">update post</a>. I hate bothering them with it because I don&#39;t want to <i>impose</i>. Fear of being an annoyance or fear that I&#39;m putting a friend in the position of &quot;humoring&quot; me so my feelings don&#39;t get hurt.

Of course, I could always edit it myself and post it without a beta read--I guess its general practice for some people to rely only on their own edits. The very thought of doing that, though, <i>paralyzes</i> me with--you guessed it--fear. The idea that my work is not good enough on its own, that I <i>must</i> have someone else tell me what I need to fix so it&#39;ll be good enough. The fear that the advice I get is the only thing that makes it good enough to post. Fear that anything less than as perfect as I am capable of making it is not good enough. Fear that my grammar/punctuation/plot mistakes will make me look stupid.

Fear is holding me back.

What&#39;s worse? I don&#39;t know what to do about it. It&#39;s not easy to see the problem and then fix it when it requires repeated courage gathering. This is a lifelong practice of mine that I&#39;ve not had a lot of success defeating. I let my fear defeat me over and over again and not just in writing--in anything that instills fear in me. I don&#39;t put myself out there in life, I don&#39;t take risks, I don&#39;t meet people, I don&#39;t draw attention to myself and the idea of changing that scares me. I&#39;m not brave in the face of my insecurities. In fact, I&#39;d say the only time I face my fears is when I&#39;m given no other choice (and that doesn&#39;t happen often). I guess its not really a stretch to see why I suffer from anxiety.

I&#39;m glad I read that article today. If nothing else comes of it, it was a good exercise in acknowledging the truth in myself. Acknowledgement, acceptance and ownership is the first steps of recovery, right? Still, I don&#39;t know what to do about it. I don&#39;t know if I can push myself far enough out of my comfort zone to post unbeta&#39;d. I also don&#39;t know if I can make myself ask for what I need from other people should the first option fail. Either way, I&#39;ll just leave this here to remind myself that I&#39;m letting fear ruin something I enjoy, something that helps release the creative need that builds up in me.

I hope some day I can learn to be brave.

&quot;Taro&quot; by Alt-J

[Verse 1:]
Indochina
Capa jumps
Jeep, two feet creep up the road
To photo, to record, meat lumps and war
They advance as does his chance
Very yellow white flash!
A violent wrench grips mass, rips light, tears limbs like rags
Burst so high finally Capa lands
Mine is a watery pit
Painless with immense distance
From medic from colleague, friend, enemy, foe, him five yards from his leg
From you
Taro
Do not spray into eyes &ndash; I have sprayed you into my eyes

[Verse 2:]
3:10 PM
Capa pends death, quivers, last rattles, last chokes
All colors and cares glaze to gray
Shriveled and stricken to dots
The left hand grasps what the body grasps not
Le photographe est mort
3.1415, alive no longer my amour
Faded for home May of &lsquo;54
Doors open like arms, my love
Painless with a great closeness
To Capa, to Capa Capa dark after nothing, re-united with his leg and with you
Taro

Do not spray into eyes &ndash; I have sprayed you into my eyes

"event","Edit: I realized after I posted this that I&#39;d covered much of my health issues before in the <a href=""http://novembersguest.livejournal.com/155047.html"" target=""_blank""><u><b>very last post</b></u></a> I made--sorry for the repeat of info. I can&#39;t say my &nbsp;memory has improved much.

It&#39;s been a while, eh? Its been on my mind that it&#39;d be nice to touch base with everyone, but I just never seemed to get it done. I guess you could say I&#39;ve been pretty insular lately, kinda gave up on building relationships in deference to just dealing with everyday life.

<lj-cut>The last two years have been rough--just when I needed a friend the most, everyone I used to talk personal talk with was kinda gone or busy. And I know all of <i>you</i> were still here, but I felt like I asked for too much without giving anything back and I just can&#39;t feel good about that. I don&#39;t wanna be the person who takes and takes but doesn&#39;t give back in equal measure. I hate feeling like a burden--so it was easier to just maintain radio silence. So, I did what I always do, I dealt on my own--took one day at a time, went through the motions, got up and did what I had to do and just kept moving forward. It&#39;s been a very long, very hard two years filled with a whole lot of anxiety, physical pain and, at times, depression. My emotions have been <i>all</i> over the map and God love those who stuck by me through all of my irrititability, temper and insecurities. I know I&#39;ve not been easy to live with at times over the course of all this upheaval.

Finally, last autumn I felt like something had to give and I went to my doctor and made it clear I needed help. This resulted in me being sent to a gynecologist and getting my antidepressant doubled. The medicine has helped calm some of the anxiety and the gynecologist gave me a diagnosis of Menorrhagia, a good-sized fibroid and possible endometriosis. I was also given a presciption for a maximum dose of naproxin, but I honestly can&#39;t tell it controls my pain any better than a Jolly Rancher. So, I have a very close relationship with my heating pad. :)

Luckily, the school changed insurances last summer and, when I checked this January, it covered the Mirena IUD, which is the number one way doctors treat endometriosis. A month or two ago I got that taken care of and things are better--not cured, but better. Also, I had a wonderful friend on Tumblr who listened to the few posts I made and extended her hand in help. You might know her, she goes by <a href=""http://mostly-jensen.tumblr.com/""><b>Mostly-Jensen</b></a>. She&#39;s very sweet, giving and has been very instrumental in me being well enough to feel like making this post. She turned me on to essential oils. Not only did she talk to me about them and her experiences, but, God bless her, she sent me a box filled with samples for me to try. Which was a big deal, especially given that she&#39;s a very private person. I feel honored that she trusted me with her information and that she went to all the trouble to make this care package for me.

It&#39;s been a blessing. I&#39;ve been using the essential oils for the last month or so and I can honestly say I think they are helping. I&#39;m not going to say they are a total answer or cure, but they have enhanced the things I was already doing. I feel a little more grounded, a little more content, a little freer of burden and less anxious and panicked. Plus, I stopped rolling from one flu/cold to the next.

I find myself feeling more and more moments of happiness. Enough so that when I received the most lovely story review for <i>What Comes After </i>this week, I gathered my courage to reach out and ask for help getting a new chapter beta read while I work on the next. Honestly, it was hard to do that and has been the primary factor in why the story has stalled for so long. I&#39;m so afraid of being a burden on anyone over this story and all of my usual beta readers have left, all save one and she&#39;s so busy I feel terrible asking. I have a friend or two that have offered, but they are also busy and I just can&#39;t keep bugging them.

So what do I do? I don&#39;t feel comfortable posting without another pair of eyes and I don&#39;t feel like searching for new beta readers. I&#39;m kinda picky about who I trust--not just in terms of who I think will do a quality job, but who I think won&#39;t leave me feeling even more discouraged. I appreciate advice, but too much nitpicking only serves to dishearten me...especially when it comes in terms of style choices and personal theory on characters or things that really aren&#39;t a big deal overall. Anyway, I guess that&#39;s a worry for some other day since I&#39;ve still got one willing soul still saying yes when I ask.

In other news, this school year has been a relief considering how bad I was hating my job last time we talked. We got fourth graders handed off to us this year and they have been so precious and so much fun. Little kids, man, there&#39;s nothing like working with kids under a certain age. &nbsp;Its been so good, so refreshing to get to work with these little ones. On top of that, my autistic girl I spend all afternoon with has been so much better this year. We seem to have reached some sort of truce and I hope it holds through the remaining six weeks or so of school.

I finally had to accept that not every single piece of work we did had to have a grade. I&#39;ve always been a firm believer that if the kids put in the time and effort to do the work I hand out, I was responsible for making sure it was properly graded. This year, though, something had to give. So I started devising ways to get around being buried in paperwork and grading. We also have iPads now and so I started putting educational apps on them and having one day a week be iPad day so long as they have their work completed and don&#39;t have any re-works to do.

Next year my job will be changing in a very big way. I can&#39;t say if its going to be a good change or a bad change. There are a lot of pros, but the possible cons are doozies. The high school principal pulled me aside a couple of months ago to tell me the current high school special ed teacher had applied for the elementary position and they had given it to her and were pulling me over to take her place. This means I will be back to doing full-time teaching again rather than babysitting one student or being pushed out into other classrooms for a big part of the day. It means I&#39;ll have my own room all to myself and it means I can&#39;t be pulled to cover other teacher&#39;s classes unexpectedly (which I despise--there&#39;s a reason I do special ed and not regular room). It means I&#39;ll be teaching subject matter I&#39;m more comfortable with and more interested in. It means no more 5th/6th grade lunch duty--hallelujah! Those kids are animals, I tell ya, wild animals bent on breaking my will!

The cons? The big two are: 1) I&#39;ll miss working with my sister and 2) I&#39;ll be working with my least favorite age group. People say middle school is hard--but I&#39;ve had high school before (when I did art) and I can say assuredly that high schoolers are no cake walk. I&#39;m especially nervous because I know some of the boys who&#39;ll be in my classes and they aren&#39;t exactly easy to get along with<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">--unmotivated, lazy, sassy, obnoxious, disrespectful</span>. I don&#39;t look forward to the possible conflict. In fact, I&#39;m really nervous about it because I really, really, really hate conflict. But I equally hate a noisy, boisterous room. I can&#39;t have chaos in my classroom or my nerves <i>will</i> explode. I tend to run a pretty tight ship with clear boundaries, but at the same time, I really struggle with the conflict that sometimes arises. I want the kids to like being in my room, I want them to feel comfortable, so its really hard on me when I have to discipline or confront a situation--I&#39;m typically a passive, quiet, shy, sensitive person and this part of teaching has always been unnerving for me, especially so when the kids are bigger than me. *sigh*. Also, I&#39;ll have to learn how to do transistioning for my students. Transition is a plan you make for post-high school and its something that I&#39;ve not dealt with and don&#39;t know a lot about.

And I&#39;m really going to miss working with my sister. I&#39;ll miss our venting sessions, I&#39;ll miss her help and support and the food goodies she surprises me with. I&#39;ll miss the security of having someone I trust fully to watch my back and just be there so I&#39;m never in the room alone with other adults. We&#39;ve been partners in the same room for years and its going to be hard to have that separation. However, in a way, its a good thing too. She&#39;s older than I by several years and is already looking at retirement. Every year I&#39;ve been scared and worried about how I will deal with her leaving and then being forced to share the room with some stranger. At least this way that burden of worry is removed. A band aid being ripped off. Still, it makes me sad. Change is hard and I&#39;ve never been one to welcome change.

She&#39;s been focused on helping me get excited about making a plan for decorating my new room, though. We&#39;ve got a color scheme picked out and I&#39;ve got some ideas to try to make the room as calming and welcoming as possible. I&#39;m going with greens and turquoise colors with some cream thrown in. I want to cover my bulletin board in burlap fabric painted in a cream. Then I&#39;m planning on using two kinds of trimmers layered one on top of each other. I&#39;m going to try to work up the money to buy a diffuser and diffuse calming essential oils. I&#39;ve got plans to incorporate as much plant life as possible and I want to get a bird feeder to attach to the outside window to give help keep us all calm. Nature calms me and I&#39;m going to miss the scenery outside my current window. :&#39;(

I&#39;ve asked for desks to replace the tables and I&#39;m going to set a basket of Himalayan salt rocks with a light somewhere near my desk--also looking to afford a small tabletop water fountain as well. I&#39;m going to try to make some terrariums this summer and I hope to find the money to buy some bamboo windchimes. I&#39;ve also got my eye on some wall decals that are really cool. See this one? <b><u><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MHIA8WI/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=1PZ2L02VBNFAN&amp;coliid=I253LGVK0O4QA&amp;psc=1"" target=""_blank"">CLICK ME!</a> </u></b>Cool, right? And this one: <u><b><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PYZ7YQ4/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=1PZ2L02VBNFAN&amp;coliid=I2YZQGV3DVXR4R"" target=""_blank"">CLICK ME!</a> </b></u> I&#39;ve also spent a lot of time on looking at apps to use in the classroom and working up some plans to reward/discourage behaviors and to just help make the classroom run as smoothly as possible by having plans in place. I&#39;m hoping with enough positive things and a positive atmosphere, it&#39;ll help keep my worst nightmares to a minimum. I feel like a general going into battle.

All of this equals being excited, scared and nervous--I hope it works out to be a good thing and not a bad thing. I need for my job to be something I don&#39;t dread.

The last few months have been very busy for me. I&#39;ve done a lot of research both for my classroom next year but also about essential oils (how to use them and where to buy them as cheaply as possible while getting quality). I&#39;m thinking about making some body butter, bath fizzies and some sugar scrub for the women in my life as Mother&#39;s Day gifts if I have the money for the ingredients. Got all kinds of terrarium and other projects pinned on Pinterest. I&#39;ve rearranged my living/bedroom completely around and have created an art center in front of my bedroom window. Been watching watercolor tutorials, reading every article I can on improving my writing skills, actively searching for new and different kinds of music (I adore Alt-J) and just a lot of reading on this and that. I&#39;m the epitome of never stop learning. I&#39;m a perpetual student and I love it--so long as I&#39;m learning about things I enjoy. :)

Also, finally watched a Paul Walker movie this week. First one since his death--just couldn&#39;t bring myself to do it until now. I loved him--not nearly the same as I love and adore Jensen, but enough that his death hit me hard.

So, a lot of changes in my life, a lot of things keeping me busy and a lot of planning going on. Some days are still hard and I sometimes feel down and lonely, but I think, overall, I&#39;ve been on an upswing. I&#39;m feeling hopeful again. I hope it continues and I hope all of you are doing well. I&#39;ve not heard much from anyone lately, but I hope this finds you all living well and feeling good. I wish I could give you all whatever it is that you need most right now. Even when I&#39;m not here, I still think about several of you all the time--you&#39;re always in my heart. I wonder how you&#39;re doing, if your life has changed too, if you&#39;re sad or happy. I wish my thoughts of you could be packaged and sent out to somehow make your day happier, easier. I&#39;m sending warm hugs to you and hoping you feel my love and appreciation. *hugs hard*

That&#39;s my update. I&#39;m not sure how cohesive it is given my contacts are giving me heck. Sorry it turned out to be so long!</lj-cut>

On Tuesday, I went to see an OB-GYN to see if I could get a diagonisis on why I&#39;m in so much pain. Its not something I&#39;ve posted about here because I get tired of posting nothing but problems and I feel too overwhelmed to even do this much a lot of days. I&#39;ve been experiencing horrible pain since I had my Mirena removed last spring (couldn&#39;t get it replaced because I couldn&#39;t afford it). I&#39;ve always had really nightmarish menstrual cycles even as a teen, but for the last 11 years I didn&#39;t have to worry about it because, with the Mirena, my periods stopped altogether. When I got them back, it came back with a horrible vengence. By August, it was making me so ill--uncontrolled pain in my back/bladder/abdomen, dizziness, nausea, sick sweats, and profuse blood loss (I have to double up on protection just too keep from embarrassing myself).</p><lj-cut><p>The last few months have been a little better in terms of dizziness and bleeding, probably because I&#39;ve had some holiday vacation time (being on my feet makes it worse), but the pain is always a problem--most intense before and during my cycle, but it can happen at anytime during the month. <span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">I had been taking 3-4 ibuprofen and 3 acetaminophen, but its like eating candy, no noticeable effect. Using a heating pad helps some, so I keep one at home and at work now. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">My regular doctor prescribed prescription strength naproxen sodium after being abhorred by the amount of over the counter pain meds I was taking on my own, but it doesn&#39;t help much either. So, finally, they referred me on to the OB-GYN.

He says he found a fibroid about the size of a ping pong ball, but they&#39;re pretty common in women and he doesn&#39;t really think its my biggest issue. Its possible it could be the reason I feel pressure on my bladder, but he doesn&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s causing the severe pain. He feels I likely have endometriosis (which runs in the family)--but he says there&#39;s no way to know for sure without surgery and he doesn&#39;t want to jump to such a drastic solution. So, he&#39;s putting me on birth control pills. Supposedly, these particular ones will help lessen the severity of my menstrual cycle and also help lessen the symptoms of the endrometriosis. The catch? It&#39;ll take 4-6 months before I will know if its going to work or not.

This is one of the reasons I&#39;ve not been writing much or interacting on the internet very often--I feel completely exhausted and crappy a lot of the time and several days a month I&#39;m in a lot of pain (which is also exhausting and draining on all my reserves). It&#39;s close to comparable to having a kidney stone at some points, leaving me desperate for pain relief that my meds just can&#39;t seem to achieve or even come close to achieving. But, hopefully by summer things will turn around. And, at least it doesn&#39;t look like its something serious like cancer or anything like that.

Meanwhile, its increased my struggle with feeling depressed, overwhelmed and stressed--even over the tiniest of things like answering a comment or replying to a review or sending out Christmas cards. Work is something I&#39;ve grown to <i>hatehatehate</i> since the onset of this. Some days, it feels like it is all I can do just to be around people, much less meet any demands or anything else. That sounds so bad, but I&#39;m so not up to it. On those days, all I want is to be at home and left alone. But, you know, I have to go. There&#39;s no choice in the matter. It feels like climbing an impossibly grueling mountain that doesn&#39;t seem to have an end. Just constant struggling up over the rocks and cliffs day after day in harsh sun with only the smallest of respites when I get home at night or on the weekends.

Anyway, that&#39;s what&#39;s been going on. I was hoping for a faster solution, but I guess I&#39;m just glad someone is taking my pain seriously and assures me what I&#39;m going through is no trivial thing. I&#39;m sorry for being such a slacker, but I&#39;m unmotivated and apathetic these days. I kinda just stick my head in the sand and try to get by as easily as possible. So, if I have a wish and a prayer for this new year, its that my health will improve and I&#39;ll know what it is to feel good again. I hate being this way.

Thanks again to all of you who continue to send me wonderful comments that I take and hold close to my heart. You are the most supportive interaction I tend to have on these personal issues these days (outside my hubs) and I&#39;m ever grateful for those of you who keep commenting even though you rarely get a response.

I wish I could send you all a million dollars, a bucket of the best chocolate, a year of roses and huge, warm hugs. You may not feel it, but I do need you and I&#39;m so appreciative of your kindnesses toward me. Especially my regular cheering squad who are always there with a smile, a hug or some needed word.</span> You gals are so sweet and patient and loving toward me always--even when I know you&#39;re busy and have your own troubles. Thank you so, so much. I wish I could pull myself up by my boot straps long enough to return the favor.

Also, may you all have a fabulous 2015. Its my urgent prayer that we are all blessed this coming year with some great things, happy news and further friendship. Love you all!</p></lj-cut><p></p>"

"event","Oh, man. My confidence in my writing abilities is at an all time low.  Hence, this post--I'd have to be in a pretty desperate mood to be posting my feelings as I've been trying to avoid doing just that. But. *sigh* But I need to let off a little steam so maybe I can try to find a way to regroup.

I've been trying to do some editing on WCA in the last week... Which somehow led to me editing an old piece that was an extension of a drabble I did a few years back (Frozen: Extended). I got it in my head that it was a good idea to post that edited piece on Tumblr--which I don't usually do.  Now I wish maybe I hadn't. 

My confidence level in my writing has been a pretty big hindrance to my output for quite a while anyway. Every time I open my WCA chapter, it just sounds hokey and like what bad fanfic writing is known for.  I feel really stupid when I read it. And now, I've got a friend who read my Tumblr post and told me she had some comments about it...which doesn't sound like good news. 

So I went back to re-read it and all I can feel is wrong and stupid. I feel like it's a joke, like I've been a fool to believe I could be halfway decent at this. I mean, yeah, I've had some folks praise my stories--but considering I've read some writing I thought was pretty awful and was aware of that story getting praise because it catered to the hurt!Dean crowd, that doesn't exactly boost my confidence. Of course the praise seems more concrete coming from people who's work I admire (because it's more like having a professional tell you your work is good rather than a peer)--a few I'm lucky to call friends. Even then, it's a constant battle to hang on to those encouragements.

It's painful and distracting to try to write or edit when you feel like a complete failure. I don't know what to do. I desperately want to finish WCA and, when my insecurities aren't running wild, I dearly love unleashing my mind through telling a story--but I'm just one of those people who doesn't want to invest in a thing unless I'm good at it. I can't do it just for the fun of it...I want it to mean something, to be something I can feel proud of. I need to feel like it's worthy of the praise.  Right now, I don't feel that way. I feel pretty average and unremarkable. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I can very much identify with Salieri's desire (<i>need</i>) to create something beautiful, but knowing I'm textbook mediocrity next to the Mozarts in life (from the movie Amadeus). That is me. Mediocre at best.

I feel so discouraged."

"event","So, way back in the summer, <lj user=""sodakey"" /> shared this video. Recently, I went back to it and shared it with my daughter who is of middle school age now. The school provided all the students with iPads this year, so I just emailed a link to her and let her watch on her own. I wanted to let her form her own opinions about it without my input--at least, at first. I wanted to get her initial reaction.

When she had finished watching it, she immediately took her earbuds out and said, &quot;So, what did you think about that?&quot; I put my laptop down and turned to face her directly and said, &quot;I&#39;m more interested in knowing what <i>you</i> think about it.&quot; She said, &quot;I think they&#39;re right. People at school say that sometimes, but I just look at them and say,&quot; she shrugged her shoulders, &quot;So? I am a girl. Nothing wrong with that.&quot; She went on to say that some of the girls get really mad, but said she didn&#39;t because she doesn&#39;t care, there&#39;s nothing wrong with being a girl. Sometimes I wonder how in the world I managed to get such a smart kid.

Anyway, here&#39;s the video in case any of you would like to share it with your kids.

"event","It&rsquo;s been 2 days since the Supernatural season finale aired and I find myself unable to get it off my mind. I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it. More importantly, I find myself unable to stop FEELING so much about it. As I told someone else, I have to give Carver and the writers credit on giving me something to think about, on giving me something I want to talk about endlessly. I haven&rsquo;t felt this passionate, this obsessed about this show since probably around season three or four. No Rest for the Wicked was the last finale that affected me like this, but even that wasn&rsquo;t quite the same because I wasn&rsquo;t so afraid for Dean then as I am now. The fact that I&rsquo;m so moved and feeling so much, that I have so many questions, makes me happy because its nice to have that spark back&mdash;but on the other hand, as the adrenaline wears off, I&rsquo;m starting to also feel depressed as well. Depressed for Dean.

It seems ridiculous for someone my age to be so involved with a TV show that I&rsquo;m letting it have such a huge impact on me. The night after the finale aired, I woke up at 3 AM, my mind spinning and my heart still racing. How is that possible? It&rsquo;s possible because I have so much invested in Dean Winchester. I can understand how playing Dean has taken its mental toll on Jensen, because I don&rsquo;t even have to live in Dean&rsquo;s skin and its taken its toll on ME. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve written many a paragraph describing my love for Dean and what he means to me. I&rsquo;ve created fan videos, fan art and written fanfiction (the general, PG variety). There&rsquo;s not another character, literary or otherwise, that has ever moved me like Dean Winchester. I fell in love with him during the Pilot, September 13th, 2005. I was completely obsessed and entered into fandom for the first time by the second half of the that first season. He has captured my heart and my attention like no other character. I&rsquo;ve stuck with this show even when there were times it upset me more than it made me happy.

Because of &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Trap,&rdquo; I began writing again&mdash;something that has taken a place of great importance in my identity and how I see my life. Its become a channel for all the creative stuff that&rsquo;s going on in my head (because, there&rsquo;s&mdash;no lie&mdash;a constant stream of storytelling going on in my head all the time). Because of Dean, I&rsquo;ve made friends, lost friends (who stopped watching SPN or just disappeared), made enemies, and lost enemies who became friends. I&rsquo;ve lost a lot of sleep, shirked duties (mostly laundry :p) because of this character and this show. I&rsquo;ve been through some major life changes over the last ten years and there have been times that focusing on this character and Jensen Ackles has been the light at the end of the tunnel, the thing that got my mind off the hard life situations that I had no power or control over. Its given me escape when life was too hard. I&rsquo;ve lived with Dean Winchester being the center of my creative world and my dream world for nearly ten years now. So, yes, I&rsquo;m deeply, irrevocably involved in this character and his well being.

I guess it shouldn&rsquo;t be such a surprise that I&rsquo;d have such mixed feelings about &ldquo;Do You Believe in Miracles.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not even sure how to put my thoughts and feelings into any kind of ordered sense even as I write this. I&rsquo;m moved, I&rsquo;m depressed, I&rsquo;m upset, I&rsquo;m scared, I&rsquo;m heartbroken, I&rsquo;m excited, I&rsquo;m confused and I keep cycling through all these emotions to the point that I&rsquo;m not really sure what I feel. Over a character on a TV show (thank you Jensen Ackles for keeping me addicted to Dean).

When season 9 began, I really didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. Though I was still in love with Dean as much as ever, I was holding the show at a distance because there were things going on with that I didn&rsquo;t like. It bothered me too much to invest too much in something that was making me unhappy. I won&rsquo;t go into all the reasons for my unrest, but I will say that a large looming part of it was how the brothers were being portrayed. Even though I am a 100 %, through and through Dean girl, I&rsquo;ve always also been invested in the brother relationship as well and I&rsquo;ve always hated their fighting (or even fighting with Cas). The one thing I disagree with Jensen about is that the brothers would have nothing to do but drink beers if there was no conflict between them&mdash;no, Jensen, no.

There can be conflict of all kinds from many directions w/o Sam and Dean raging at each other. And these last two years Sam and Dean have felt more like strangers than brothers, like enemies who decided to call a truce for a common goal than the family that was once irrationally, psychotically codependent. I know brothers bicker, but this was all out war. The things they&rsquo;ve said to each other, hard to imagine you could ever find a place of forgiveness&mdash;there was nothing &ldquo;mature&rdquo; about the things that were said in anger and in spite (even if it did come from a place of hurt). This stopped feeling like a show about family.

The bond between Dean and Sam has been more or less broken to some degree for me since season four&mdash;but it reached an all-time high during season 8. I finally got to the point that I just had to stop caring about them as brothers and focus on Dean only&mdash;it was that, or begin to hate Sam for the pain I felt he was heaping on the one person in his life who had loyally sacrificed everything for him repeatedly. I felt angry at Sam, really angry. When the second half of season 9 began, I was furious at Sam, livid, because I felt he was being purposely cruel&mdash;but because I was able to put him in the &lsquo;don&rsquo;t care about this&rsquo; box in my brain, I think I was successful in avoiding hating him. Obviously, I was successful because, otherwise, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been so moved by this scene from the finale: http://novembersguest.tumblr.com/post/86373812785/clairvoyantsam-im-proud-of-us#.U34P-vldXhc

That scene, folks. That scene went a long way toward making this episode a positive for me. That scene is the first time in a very long time I felt like Sam was Sam and that he cared about Dean. Do you see how Sam cradles Dean&rsquo;s head there in the 7th and 9th pic? That&rsquo;s how you touch someone you love. And Sam cried, really cried as he clung to Dean&rsquo;s dead body. The loving way Sam lays Dean&rsquo;s body on Dean&rsquo;s bed (&ldquo;&hellip;it remembers me&hellip;&rdquo; echoes in my head) and we see that he&rsquo;s cleaned the blood off Dean&rsquo;s face and removed his jacket. All these little touches speak of real love, something that has been sorely lacking from Sam&rsquo;s character for ages. It also helped that he admitted he lied to Dean when he said he wouldn&rsquo;t do the same. Obviously, Sam has proven that he would&rsquo;ve done the exact same thing to save Dean that Dean did for him (and has no reason to be angry about it)&mdash;so its time Sam let it go and accept it&rsquo;s who they are to each other.

Does that scene erase all the things Sam said to Dean in The Purge? No, absolutely not. Sam still has a way to go in winning me back, but this was a step in the right direction (I sincerely hope Jared continues to push for a better version of Sam). I&rsquo;m sorry, I know not everyone will agree with my feelings on this, but I want to enjoy that scene and what it means to me and these characters for just a moment. For the first time, in a long time, I felt a small stirring of love for the brothers again and was reminded of how much I used to enjoy their bond back when I still believed in it. I&rsquo;m still upset with Sam, make no mistake about that. His words to Dean this season were designed to hurt Dean in the worst possible way and pushed Dean over the edge, bringing him to where we are now. I don&rsquo;t take that lightly.

Sam should take responsibility for his part in this, because if he had shown Dean some compassion and forgiveness when Dean stood on the bridge confessing his sins and fears, we wouldn&rsquo;t be here now. I know Sam was mad and he was hurt&mdash;but his words weren&rsquo;t words thrown out in the heat of a passionate fight. These were calculated words designed to cut deep and were followed up by months of the cold shoulder at a time when Dean needed him the most. He left Dean to suffer alone (because Cas was absent). He left Dean to fall into despair and self-loathing the likes of which we&rsquo;ve never seen before&hellip;and that&rsquo;s saying something. He let Dean down in a big way after Dean has repeatedly been there for him. So, no, I don&rsquo;t think that moment in the finale erases all that came before, but it does give me hope that we can get there. To me, that is a good thing. A really, really good thing.

Besides, the truth is, there is nothing Sam can say to make those things okay. There&rsquo;s no apology that can erase how much he hurt Dean. The only way Sam can fix this is through his actions. Actions are the only believable way for Sam to make this good between them again. You have to start somewhere, right? Well, this was it, the beginning (at least, I hope it continues). Either way, we know how this show works and they&rsquo;re never going to give us an in-depth resolution between Sam and Dean like we want&mdash;and its never going to go back to the way it was the first few seasons. So, for now, I&rsquo;m choosing to take what I can get and make the most of it.

Something else about the finale that I deeply appreciate, Dean stayed Dean up until his dying breath. Dean&rsquo;s foremost concern remained on Sam, as always, for better or for worse. That&rsquo;s Dean. It will be easier on you if you can accept that about him. He could&rsquo;ve held a grudge against Sam, he could&rsquo;ve died in Sam&rsquo;s arms with spiteful words on his tongue&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t. His last act was to place a loving hand on Sam&rsquo;s cheek. His last words to Sam were that he was proud of them. That&rsquo;s Dean. He forgives. He loves. He has a heart so big, he loves enough for the both of them and several others. No matter how much some fellow fans might sometimes wish he&rsquo;d tell Sam to get lost, I am glad he didn&rsquo;t&mdash;not in this circumstance. That&rsquo;s not who he is and that&rsquo;s an admirable quality in my eyes. If anyone sees him as being weak for that, so be it. I love him for it. He always rises above his own needs and his own hurts to love those he holds in his heart. That is real strength. Its easy to be vengeful and angry, its hard to be selfless and forgiving.

Despite the Mark&rsquo;s influence, when the going got tough, Dean was still strong enough to see what the Mark was doing to him. In the end, he recognized its destructive influence and made it blatantly clear that he would choose death over becoming something else. He didn&rsquo;t want that. Despite the &ldquo;high&rdquo; he got from the power of the Mark, Dean fought back, knew he would rather die than let it make him a monster. He chose and he chose rightly. Which is what makes what happened at the end so very hard for me to accept (but also gives me great comfort knowing what happened wasn&rsquo;t his fault). The Mark took the choice out of his hands and turned him anyway, against his will.

I admit, I wasn&rsquo;t ready for Dean to be rid of the Mark completely. It&rsquo;s been years and years and years since Dean had a storyline. It&rsquo;s been since season four since Dean seemed important to the Supernatural story for being Dean and not Sam&rsquo;s brother or anyone&rsquo;s support system. So, yeah, I&rsquo;ve been excited. It&rsquo;s great to see Dean have something important going on in his personal story that is all his. The best part? Jensen Ackles. Give the man something meaty to do and he will take that and nuance, tease and act the last drop out of it. He will give his all to that role. He will make you FEEL it in your bones&mdash;you will believe Dean is a real person, you will feel what he feels. Dean has broken my heart, scared me and made me believe in heroes of the human variety.

In her review of the finale, <lj user=""gaelicspirit"" /> pointed out when Jensen is at the top of his game, Jared reciprocates. Jared seems to feed off of Jensen&rsquo;s energy and bring his best too. I agree with that assessment. Both Jensen and Jared&rsquo;s acting improves when Dean has a challenging role and, in turn, the overall quality of the show increases substantially. I love it. I love seeing actors in their element giving themselves over to their craft so completely. Its inspiring. Jensen Ackles will never know how much I appreciate his efforts for this character, how much he personally has made Dean meaningful to me, but I feel it nonetheless. Those of you who will get that chance to see him in person, please make sure he knows that he rocks our world in all the best and most painful ways and how much we love and appreciate him for it. Jensen is directly responsible for making Dean so important to us and he deserves credit for that.

So, yeah, I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the Mark of Cain storyline for these reasons, but at the same time, I feel like I&rsquo;ve gone into mourning over the possibility that Dean has lost his humanity. I hurt for Dean&rsquo;s lost humanity, the most important thing to him&mdash;his identity. The thought that Dean has become the thing he hates most upsets me beyond words. I hate that when we come back in the fall, Dean might not be Dean anymore. That the human Dean&mdash; the righteous man who fought against monsters, Hell, demons and angels, to always do what is right&mdash;might be truly gone and the very thing he&rsquo;s died fighting against is his new reality. Around Tumbr, people have been blogging fan art that contains the words, &ldquo;You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.&rdquo; It worries me that perhaps Dean has done both. He died a hero, but has he also been reborn a villain? I hope not. I just don&rsquo;t think I could stand watching that happen.

The only way I can be okay with what has happened to Dean is if, somewhere inside, Dean is still there. Our Dean. I&rsquo;m hoping that there will be enough humanity left in Dean to fight against his new nature. We know he&rsquo;s not a typical demon. He didn&rsquo;t go to Hell where his soul was burned away&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t sell his soul or make a deal (like Cain). He isn&rsquo;t possessed (which is why his anti-possession tattoo doesn&rsquo;t work). But, Dean the man is dead&hellip;so what exactly is he now? Is he like Cain? If so, Cain had the ability to do the right thing. He married and he put violence behind him for his wife. Will Dean have that same control?

Crowley said to Dean, &ldquo;Listen to me Dean Winchester. What you&rsquo;re feeling right now, its not death. It&rsquo;s life. A new kind of life.&rdquo; Was he talking about a new kind of life as a demon or did he mean something that has never been before? A new creature? Is Dean something entirely other than human or demon. Does he mean life as in something living or&hellip;what, exactly? We don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m hoping there is humanity left in Dean and that our Dean will rise above whatever the Mark has done to him to conquer any control it has over him. I hope Dean will be able to resist. The last thing I want out of this is to see Dean truly become evil or to see Sam and Cas having to hunt him. There&rsquo;s a better story to be told through seeing Sam and Castiel support and stand by their brother and friend and in seeing Dean use his internal strength to hang on to who he really is inside, where it matters. I want to see him prove to himself that he is not a killer or poison to everything he touches.

But I&rsquo;m scared. I&rsquo;m scared that&rsquo;s not how it will play out. I&rsquo;m afraid that Dean&rsquo;s legacy will be full circle tragedy in which he is the monster. I&rsquo;m worried that we won&rsquo;t recognize him or see the man we love there anymore. I&rsquo;m afraid that we will suffer through another season of the brothers fighting against each other instead of side by side.

And where do we go from here? How do you fix this? Dean&rsquo;s not a normal demon (if one at all), so I don&rsquo;t see how the cure would work on him. Besides, no way do I want to watch Sam going through the trials again. Cain made it pretty clear that he wants Dean to kill him, so he&rsquo;s not likely to be willing to take the Mark back. Even if Cain can and will take the Mark back, Dean died. The man, the human, died. What does that leave behind if the Mark is removed? A dead body? A regular demon? What? Cain killed himself at some point, but was still alive after he passed the Mark to Dean and, evidently, still had demon powers. Cain also sold his soul and spent time in Hell&mdash;which makes him different from Dean.

Just about the time I convince myself maybe Dean&rsquo;s not a true demon, Crowley&rsquo;s words come back to me. &ldquo;Open your eyes, Dean. See what I see. Feel what I feel. Let&rsquo;s go take a howl at that moon.&rdquo; Ominous. Creepy. Chilling. That&rsquo;s what I feel when he speaks those words. How can any good come from Dean seeing what Crowley sees, feeling what Crowley feels? Who, but a beast, howls at the moon?

And what about how Dean obeys Crowley? Will he be aligned with Crowley now? Cain obviously was more powerful than Crowley and not under anyone&rsquo;s control&mdash;but does this apply to Dean? And why was this done in this manner? Could anyone have told Dean to open his eyes and he would? Did he need the blade in order for it to happen? Was those words Crowley spoke chosen for a specific reason? Was it like a spell? I don&rsquo;t know. I want to know why Crowley started to believe in the myth of Cain simply because Dean chose not to eat a cheeseburger. I don&rsquo;t have these answers and its really hard knowing I have to wait four months to find out.

So here I am, confused about how I feel, but feeling so very passionate about whatever it is I do feel. I hope for better things for next season. I hope we get to see Dean and Cas&rsquo;s friendship rekindled, as its been sorely lacking this year. I hope that along with the hurt Dean feels, we finally get some comfort and even some appreciation. Hurt without the comfort becomes too overwhelming and depressing after a while. I need to have some good things going on for Dean. Some happiness. I need for the veil of darkness to lift, even if only a little. I need for there to be support for Dean, from Sam and Cas. He deserves it. Above all, I hope that whatever happens, its something Dean can live with. Something I can live with, too. Dean is my hero. He has been my hero for a decade&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t want to lose that now. And, please, please don&rsquo;t let there be anymore secrets or lies between Dean/Sam/Cas.

I have 500 unread e-mails, missed four days of work and have not been online for days--so if you sent me something and have not heard from me, its because I&#39;ve not been around and it may take a while for me to get around to it. I&#39;m still recovering and only spend so much time online, the rest of the time is spent at work or sleeping. I&#39;m pretty exhausted and still don&#39;t feel up to par.

On top of being sick, I also had a bad reaction to some of my medicine. Apparently I&#39;m allergic to penicillin now and don&#39;t tolerate albuterol at all. The penicillin is just causing swelling and hives, but that inhaler--thought I was gonna die. My heart tried to beat right out of my chest and I couldn&#39;t breathe. Scary stuff.

So, please, give me a little time to catch up and to get to feeling better. Its been a slow process and I&#39;m feeling extremely overwhelmed by everything. I was actually glad we didn&#39;t have a new Supernatural episode last night because I wasn&#39;t up to the emotional toll the show takes these days. Anyway, sorry for not getting back to those who have reached out to me in the last week--I really appreciate the communication and I will get around to as much as I can as quickly as I can. Its nice to know that if I drop off the face of the planet, someone notices. :)

Once they have tackled a project, they do everything in their power to achieve their goals. In everyday life, they often prove to be excellent problem solvers. They like to get to the root of things and have a natural curiosity and a thirst for knowledge. At the same time, they are practically oriented, well organized and in a position to tackle complex situations in a structured and carefully considered manner. When they concentrate on something, they do so one hundred percent - they often become so immersed in a task that they forget everything else around them. That is the secret of their often very large professional success.</span>

They seldom fall in love head over heels nor do they like quick affairs. They sometimes find it very difficult to clearly show their affection although their feelings are deep and sincere. In as far as their circle of friends is concerned, their motto is: less is more! As far as new contacts are concerned, they are approachable to only a limited extent; they prefer to put their energy into just a few, close friendships. Their demands on friends and partners are very high. As they do not like conflicts, they hesitate for some time before raising unsatisfactory issues and, when they do, they make every effort not to hurt anyone as a result.</span>

"event","<p>Last night&#39;s Supernatural seriously left me feeling depressed. It seems a large number of people have forgotten the basic premise of this show, including Sam. But I&#39;ll get to that in a moment. First, let me get a few things off my chest.

Since when is Dean the bad guy in all of this? Why is it suddenly all on him to shoulder the blame for everything bad that has happened? Did we forget that it was Gadreel that betrayed &amp; tricked Dean? Dean thought this was an angel he could trust, one that Cas had given his approval of and said was trustworthy--so don&#39;t go blaming Kevin&#39;s death on Dean. And the closing of the gates? All Sam. I&#39;m sorry, but he made that choice. He didn&#39;t have to listen to Dean. If he was ready to die, if he really wanted to complete the trials, all he had to do was continue with them.

Also, Sam is the one who convinced Dean he wanted to live. How was Dean to know Sam was ready to die? Sam took on the trials under the whole premise that he wanted to live and that he wanted to show Dean there was a light at the end of the tunnel. All Sam has done since is take away the light that keeps Dean going. When Gadreel appeared to Sam as Dean, Sam chose to live AGAIN. If he really wanted to die, he could have denied him and walked peacefully away with Death. Gadreel couldn&#39;t do anything without his consent. Sam didn&#39;t want to die either of those times--seems like its just a convenient guilt trip to lay on Dean.</p><p>No way Show or anyone else is going to convince me that Dean has caused more harm than good (wow, this coming from Sam who has the innocent blood of people on his hands via the demon blood AND soulless Sam? Talk about more harm than good--but Dean forgave him and supported him through that). Wasn&#39;t it Sam who told Dean in What Is and What Should Never Be that what Dean does was worth it? That what Dean does is worth all the pain and sacrifice because he saves people? Sam has encouraged Dean to continue to make the choices he makes over and over. Sam has been an agent in the decisions that Dean has made. Even in Sacrifice, he put Dean in the position of swearing that Dean would always put Sam first no matter what. And now Sam wants to renege on that?&nbsp; After his big sob scene about how he wants to be important to Dean?</p><p>And Dean, selfish? Dean makes sacrifices only when it doesn&#39;t hurt him? The man has been making sacrifices his entire life for Sam and others that have wounded him in the deepest ways possible. He&#39;s given his childhood, his soul, his death, his love, his future, his whole life and everything at much cost to himself for Sam and others over and over.</p><p>Dean went to Hell for Sam--I&#39;m pretty sure that damaged him forever and ever. Dean made sacrifices for Sam growing up that hurt him all the time--some of its canon now (Bad Boys? Something Wicked?). Dean sacrificed Lisa and Ben for their own good at a great deal of hurt to himself. Dean wanted to say yes to Michael, not because of any benefit for himself, but because he wanted to save the world. Sam was the one who said no and then turned around and did the same exact thing. There&#39;s <i>no reason</i> Dean could not have said yes to Michael with the same result as Sam&#39;s yes. But Sam took that away from him. Stole Dean&#39;s &quot;agency&quot; to make that selfless sacrifice (because Dean wasn&#39;t doing it to redeem himself). That whole time period was about Sam begging Dean to live <i>for him</i>. Because the world was better with them in it together and because he didn&#39;t want to do it without Dean. What happened to that Sam?</p><p>Dean killed Benny, someone he considered his brother, for Sam and you could see the cost of that sacrifice all over Dean&#39;s face. Again, Dean wanted to do the trials, which was a selfless sacrifice on Dean&#39;s part, no avoiding pain for Dean there--I could keep going on and on.</p><p>How dare Sam say that to Dean when Sam&#39;s always been about making sacrifices to ease his guilt trips or to &quot;redeem&quot; himself in some way--&#39;cause, yeah, that&#39;s totally selfless. Is Sam maybe projecting?</p><p>But, yeah, people think Sam was 100% correct in what he said.</p><p>More than that, though, what exactly is this show based on? Because I was under the impression that it was about family and doing anything for family. I thought the whole premise of this show was based on the idea that Sam and Dean would do anything for each other and also for their friends. And now all of a sudden people think this is WRONG? That it&#39;s unhealthy? Well, maybe it is unhealthy in real life, but this is the whole foundation of a show that is anything but realistic. Since when did we want Sam and Dean&#39;s relationship to be like everyone else? Since when did everyone decide that the whole foundation of the show was wrong and wanted it to be changed?</p><p>If Dean is wrong for his choices, then this whole show has been a big farce, a big waste of time. We&#39;ve spent years being told that family was above all, that love was most important, that Dean and Sam would always save each other no matter what. Anyone recall All Hell Breaks Loose Part 2? Swan Song? Anyone? And now we are saying that&#39;s wrong? Really? If that&#39;s the case, then I&#39;m ready for the show to end. Just end it now before the entire thing is completely ruined beyond repair.

People are asking for the basic premise of the entire series to be changed under the guise of a more healthy relationship, which, apparently consists of a Sam and Dean who are ghosts of their former selves. In my opinion, the only thing that&#39;s been &quot;wrong&quot; with Sam and Dean&#39;s relationship is the fact that it&#39;s been too one-sided for far too long. The only thing that needs to be &quot;fixed&quot; is how Sam doesn&#39;t get a chance to show us he loves Dean too (if that&#39;s even true anymore). Instead, Sam&#39;s become increasingly indifferent and cold toward Dean in the name of a &quot;healthy&quot; relationship and &quot;progress.&quot;</p><p>What&#39;s been wrong about their dynamic is how SAM asks Dean to sacrifice OTHERS to focus solely on HIM. Cas, Benny, whoever. If Sam could learn to let Dean have friends and not manipulate Dean into a corner where he feels he must CHOOSE, then the problem of people being thrown off a ledge in the name of Sam and Dean&#39;s relationship wouldn&#39;t be an issue. Sam&#39;s the one who constantly needs Dean to pull his bacon out of the fire, to save him over and over. Even the fans have put the onus of Sam&#39;s salvation on Dean&#39;s shoulders, expecting him to play the big brother role and only that role. And Sam&#39;s all too happy to let him when it suits him. If Sam wants Dean to let him go, treat him like an equal, then Sam needs to step up to that plate and start swinging at the curve balls thrown his way. He needs to own his mistakes and support Dean like an adult. You are only a victim if you let yourself be one. Be a survivor, Sam, not a victim.</p><p>Its not Dean&#39;s great love for Sam that&#39;s the problem. Okay? So just get off Dean&#39;s back. He&#39;s only done what was expected from him all along. Sam has made sure Dean was alone, only focused on Sam and now he suddenly doesn&#39;t want it? Well, screw that. You begged for it, you got it. Lay in the bed you made. And let&#39;s not forget that Sam has had a healthy hand in perpetuating lies, deception and taking away the agency of others--he really shouldn&#39;t be pointing fingers. People in glasses houses, man.</p><p>As for that mythical healthy relationship--is that what we really want? We suddenly want Winchesters who let their sibling die? Who won&#39;t make sacrifices? Who won&#39;t go to extremes in the grand name of love? Really? Then exactly why have we been watching this show all this time? We knew the deal going into this show and its a complete cop out to decide Dean&#39;s all wrong for making those choices. Dean&#39;s wrong for being the big brother everyone loved <i>so</i> much, that he wasn&#39;t allowed to be anything else.</p><p>I don&#39;t know where all this will lead, but, right now, I don&#39;t know what show I&#39;m watching anymore and I don&#39;t understand the glee over last night&#39;s gut-wrenching talk. It went against everything this show is supposed to be about. Everything Kripke promised us it would always be about. Family is the theme of the show--family above all (and by family, I don&#39;t mean just family by blood). Its a little late to be saying the whole theme was all wrong and bad, bad, bad. Take that away, then every episode prior falls down like a stack of cards.</p>"

"event","Since I was passing around recs, I thought I&#39;d bring the last two SPN fics I read. Its been a while and I don&#39;t read them very often, but these two were worth reading. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve read the first, <b><u><a href=""https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8095951/1/"">&quot;Adiago&quot;</a></u></b> by <lj user=""gaelicspirit"" />. Her fictions are much well-loved by all, but this is the one I read last and it was such a moving and brilliant piece of writing that I wish it were canon.

The second is a wee!chester story. Its called <b><u><a href=""https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6636620/1/Nothing-to-be-Scared-Of"">&quot;Nothing to Be Scared Of&quot;</a></u></b> by Partly. This heartbreaking story was just wonderful. I especially enjoyed the ending scenes between Dean and John. Its these kinds of stories that remind me why I sometimes feel so protective of canon. The story that&nbsp; has been established early on is enough and doesn&#39;t need to be messed with. There will always be a wealth of gold found in those first two season of Supernatural.

There ya go. Two good reads to warm your heart or break it, its always a toss up with these boys."

"event","<p>Dear LJ, I just saw this on Facebook:

&quot;Sometimes you got to accept the fact that certain things will never go back to how they used to be.&quot; ~unknown

It&#39;s strange how the perfect advice will randomly appear at the exact right moment. As you know, LJ, 2013 was a tough year. I kicked off last January really sick with kidney stuff (nearly septic again) and ended up with two lithotripsies and a major case of depression/anxiety after that. I barely made it to summer vacation intact and then spent a large part of the summer wondering why I should get out of bed and then convincing myself to do so for the kids&#39; sake. Had anxiety attacks to the point I thought I was having a heart attack a few times. Along the way, I damaged a friendship, perhaps forever, I lost interest in pretty much everything I used to enjoy and became this person I don&#39;t really know. My job went from doable to miserable...and I&#39;m learning its not so easy to find a new one. And Supernatural, my passion? I don&#39;t even wanna talk about it. Kevin. Dean&#39;s misery. Enough said. *wibbles*

Months later and here I am facing another new year and, while things are better, they&#39;re not the same by a long shot. I&#39;m not the same and no matter how much I want to go back to being the person I was before 2013 happened, it doesn&#39;t seem possible. I&#39;ve agonized over it, pondered it, tried to change it, prayed about it--but I&#39;m beginning to think maybe I have to accept things as they are. My friendships are fewer--hard to keep them going when you are too busy being too self-involved--my hobbies different. I&#39;m less easygoing and more pessimistic--my emotions are more erratic and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m as nice as I used to be. I am also less healthy--gained back the 20 lbs I&#39;d lost in 2012 and am in worse physical condition than ever before....and what&#39;s worse, I find it hard to really care outside the fact that I&#39;m far too old to be letting myself get so out of shape. Risk factors and all being what they are for me.

What about the writing, you ask? Well. I have failed spectacularly to keep up with my WIP posting as I had promised and have nearly stopped replying to &quot;review/reminders&quot; because I&#39;m so shamefaced. I think about writing and read about writing ALL the time--but no actual writing. Didn&#39;t even participate in NaNo this year. I don&#39;t know how to pick it back up--I&#39;m insecure, frozen and my concentration is shot. I used to be able to work some writing time in at work because that was the best place for me to write concentration-wise, but that&#39;s not gonna happen anymore--not with what they&#39;ve done with my schedule. I&#39;m too rushed in the mornings and I spend my afternoons babysitting--yes, babysitting--an autistic student that really belongs in state school. I keep hoping we&#39;ll get into a routine together and maybe she&#39;ll have some calm days I can use for writing time (might as well since I&#39;m sitting there doing nothing but waiting for her to have a freak out), but even when she&#39;s calm, I spend the whole time on guard waiting for a freak out!

I don&#39;t want to give up on hoping for things--but its hard. I feel pretty hopeless, pretty stuck, pretty lonely sometimes. I feel closed off and dug in deep. I feel like I cannot be satisfied/happy with the way things currently are even though I don&#39;t see any solutions. I need some opportunities for better things to come along. So, my prayers for this new year are for it to bring me the peace of being able to accept that things can&#39;t go back the way they were and to stop wishing for it, but, <i>also</i>, for some good opportunities to present themselves to take me in a better direction...one I can live with. With that, I pray for the wisdom and courage to recognize and seize those opportunities/relationships.

Its another new year. I hope its a better year--for all of us, because I&#39;m not so out of touch or ignorant to assume I&#39;m the only one. May we all find ourselves in a better place this time next year.</p>"

I have my own theory as to which will be best received, but, as with all experiments, I need conclusive data to form a conclusion. The biggest problem I foresee is that only two or three people will actually respond to this which isn&#39;t a very big pool of data--but I&#39;ll take what I can get and move forward with it.

I enjoy it for its value to take my mind off of anything but just a sense feast (oh, man, love that effect at 2.15 in the song, I think 2.04 in the video?).

Also, I just really love this part of the lyrics:

&quot;Swim with your sorrows
And try delusion for a while,
It&#39;s such a beautiful lie.
You&#39;ve got to lose inhibition,
Romance your ego for a while.
Come on, give it a try.

Suddenly my eyes are open,
Everything comes into focus, oh,
We are all illuminated,
Lights are shining on our faces, blinding
We are, we are, blinded,
We are, we are, blinded.&quot;
~Illuminated by Hurts

When life is boring, overwhelming or just undesirable in any way, I tend to escape inside my mind--and that&#39;s kinda what this song represents to me--that escaping from reality into your head, awake dreaming. Which, today is definitely one of those days. I sometimes feel bad about it, wasting so much time in the false lives in my head (the beautiful lies), but its how I cope with things. It makes things easier to tolerate.

The video...well, I just thought it was pretty. There are other videos set to this song, more popular, but I like this one.

"event","I love the Evil Queen. Regina is a complicated character--she&#39;s not all evil, but she&#39;s definitely not all good, either. I love a lot of the female characters on OUaT, but ever since we got her back-story, Regina&#39;s been one of my favorites despite her evil ways. I find myself rooting for her to find her way back to goodness and, yet, enjoying her when she&#39;s being her most Evil Queen. Here are two of my favorite videos centered on her.

"event","<i>Nowhere am I so desperately needed as among a shipload of illogical humans. </i>~Spock, Star Trek
<lj-cut>
I keep seeing these Twitter campaigns against Castiel claiming he&#39;s pushing Sam out of his own show and I&#39;m like, are you people nuts? Sam has a WHOLE myth arc centered right on him...how in the world did you jump to that conclusion? I swear, people and the illogical leaps they make. And people keep saying the only fans who like Cas are the Dean/Cas shippers. Seriously? That&#39;s a pretty narrow-minded thing to assume. I guess if that&#39;s true, then all the people who don&#39;t like Cas MUST be Sam/Dean shippers, right? And we all know Wincest is so much more honorable and righteous than Destiel.

Me, I&#39;m not a shipper of either. I just happen to really like Castiel and what he brings to the show (and what he brings out of Dean). I&#39;ve posted my reasons before about why I like Cas, so I won&#39;t go over it again....but people need to try and accept that this show is no longer only about two brothers--its for the good of your sanity, trust me on this. It hasn&#39;t been about just Sam and Dean in YEARS and YEARS. And, I don&#39;t want it to be, honestly--not with the way the boys fight so much of the time and the way the dynamics are set up. The Sam and Dean of today are not the Sam and Dean pre-season 4. That bond died a cruel death and was never completely resurrected--that ship has sailed never to return.

Blaming Castiel for the distance between the boys and a lack of interesting developments for Sam is an erroneous leap of logic. Even <i>without</i> Cas in the picture, these two &quot;brothers&quot; have spent more time fighting each other and fighting on opposites sides than just about anything else. How can you enjoy that? I haven&#39;t. But it isn&#39;t Cas&#39;s fault. If they so chose, the writers could easily write a close bond between Sam and Dean and also include Cas into the family at large...just like other characters we&#39;ve loved.

Also, it&#39;s not Cas&#39;s fault that The Powers That Be seem intent on recycling the same old, tired plots and character points. The writers could at any time allow Dean to be the one in peril with Sam being the one doing the worrying and supporting. In that scenario, Sam fans would get to see a little character insight from Sam and Dean fans would get to see Dean doing something other than being a good big brother. But, for some odd reason, some fans seem to WANT them to stay stuck in this rut. Some seem to think its right for Dean&#39;s only purpose to be about Sam--usually the same ones behind these campaigns. I don&#39;t really get it, not after this length of time with the show, but they do. And as long as there are people to eat it up, they&#39;ll keep dishing it out.

Season 1: Something&#39;s wrong with Sam, Dean worries about him (he&#39;s got psychic powers, omg!).
Season 2: Something&#39;s wrong with Sam, Dean&#39;s scared for him (of him?) (he&#39;s a part of the special children and might go darkside, omg!).
Season 3: Something&#39;s wrong with Sam, Dean&#39;s in denial about death and still worried about Sam (he&#39;s the boy-king, chosen for a special purpose, omg!).
Season 4: Something&#39;s wrong with Sam, Dean&#39;s totally freaked about Sam and trying to save him (he&#39;s going darkside and drinking demon blood, omg! Also, let&#39;s blow the brother bond to smithereens while we&#39;re at it--it&#39;ll be fun!)
Season 5: Something&#39;s wrong with Sam, though a bit lighter this season (he&#39;s going to be Lucifer&#39;s vessel, omg! Let&#39;s waste all season <i>not</i> sufficiently repairing the rift between the brothers until <i>right</i> before the finale--it&#39;ll be fun!).
Season 6: Something&#39;s wrong with Sam, Dean&#39;s worried about him and has to save his soul (he&#39;s soulless, omg! Since the brothers just started feeling like the brothers we knew, let&#39;s blow their relationship to smithereens again, it&#39;ll be fun!)
Season 7: Something&#39;s wrong with Sam, Dean&#39;s worried about him (he&#39;s being tormented by hallucinations/Lucifer/he&#39;s got PTSD, omg!) Thanks <lj user=""andromakhe001"" /> for pointing that out.
Season 8: Something&#39;s wrong with Sam, Dean&#39;s worried about him (he&#39;s dying from the trials, omg! And, hey, let&#39;s make up a totally <i>contrived</i> reason for Sam to act like a bitch toward Dean and have them both fight like people we don&#39;t even recognize, it&#39;ll be fun!)

YAWN!!!! Yeah, don&#39;t blame Cas for that repetitive, endless mess that people love so much.

If the show didn&#39;t embrace other characters at some point, the show would have gotten very boring after this many years. Just watchin&#39; Sam and Dean fight, make up, fight some more, make up again, over and over with a heavy remix of Dean worrying about Sam and Sam having something wrong with him....since the writers don&#39;t seem to know what else to do with them. Since, <i>apparently, </i>it&#39;s boring for them to get along (whatever) and apparently Dean is not allowed to take a break from his ceaseless role as hand-wringer and caregiver. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Dean&#39;s care giving instincts as much as anyone, but I think he could survive a season or two of being the one in peril and in need of support--embrace the hurt!Dean, people, it would be awesome (and also the wise, supportive, grown up Sam).

I have enjoyed the addition of other characters over the years and it was bound to happen at some point if anyone ever expected Jensen and Jared to keep their sanity. Besides, this isn&#39;t some ill-fated love-story about a brother who has <i>no</i> life outside his little brother who <i>always</i> needs taken care of and never gets to really grow up (or is it?). It&#39;s a show about <i>family</i> struggling <i>together</i> against the forces of evil... and Castiel <i>is</i> family, like it or not. Just like Bobby and Ellen and everyone else we&#39;ve ever loved. And now we have new members of the family, Garth, Charlie, Sheriff Mills..and Benny could be if Sam would get over his unexplained snit. I&#39;d like to see more of all these characters throughout the season--keeps things interesting and helps us see different facets of the boys.

So I say, if people want to campaign, it would seem to me a better tack would be to ask for no more Sam and Dean fights and to ask for some fresh material that doesn&#39;t revolve around Sam needing to be saved by Dean ad nauseam. Maybe Sam could actually worry about and support Dean for a change? Maybe they could both be equally important in completing a terrible task to save the world (together, as a real team)? And, you know, Sam could embrace maturity and become a dedicated Men of Letters<i> alongside</i> his brother--doing what they do best, hunting things and saving people.

But, of course, this is just my opinion and I don&#39;t claim to be normal. ;)</lj-cut>"

<strong>Title: </strong>What Comes After
<strong>Author: </strong>November&#39;sGuest
<strong>Character&#39;s: </strong>Sam and Dean Winchester, Jessica Moore, Sam&#39;s Stanford friends (most OCs), and a brief appearance by Missouri Mosley.
<strong>Category: </strong>Hurt/Comfort, Horror, Angst, and AU
<strong>Rating: </strong>T (PG-13)
<strong>Spoilers: </strong>None beyond second season if any&hellip;it&#39;s pretty much AU.

<strong>Summary: </strong>Sam and Dean travel to Stanford to investigate recent deaths of college students after receiving a call from Rebecca Warren. Meanwhile, as Dean recovers from his injuries, his new and bizarre visions of Jessica continue to haunt him and Sam.

I&#39;ve re-worked some things based on that advice and also made numerous edits with each read through-so there are probably many mistakes due to my subsequent tinkering.

<p>Chapter 7: Gravity</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean found himself parked where the latest victim, Julia, had died. He looked down at her black and white picture in the morning paper. Young and pretty, her whole life ahead of her. He touched the picture with his fingertip and wondered if there was a brother, a sister, or parents left heartbroken by her death. He hadn&#39;t meant to end up here, but when he&#39;d seen the picture in the paper, he couldn&#39;t get it off his mind.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean glanced at the article to make sure he&#39;d gotten it right. It was so strange. This location was closer to the university than the apartments and spirits usually stayed bound to a certain place. Mentally tracing the path of the deaths, Dean realized that each successive attack was a little farther away from the original location. Which &mdash; <em>weird</em>. This, whatever this was, seemed to be attacking in an ever growing outward circle, and that opened the door to the possibility of something other than a simple spirit needing laid to rest.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Throwing the newspaper onto the seat, Dean rolled his shoulders and stepped out of the Impala. He&#39;d promised Sam he wouldn&#39;t do anything stupid, and coming here without back up might not be the smartest move, but Sam was drunk and Dean was tired of waiting. Waiting meant more deaths. Waiting meant more dreams of Jessica and watching his brother fall further into a tailspin. Which was stupid all on its own.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean realized Sam had lost more than Jessica that night. He&#39;d lost his place of belonging in a group that clearly not only accepted him for himself, but also looked up to him. Something Sam had never had growing up &mdash; neither of them had. They never stayed anywhere long enough to establish that kind of bond with other people. The longer they stayed here now, the harder that loss would hit his brother all over again.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Thinking over the last year and a half he&#39;d spent with Sam, he began to question whether keeping Sam close was worth that. His desire to rebuild his family and keep them close was causing more damage than anything &mdash; maybe if he hadn&#39;t come to find Sam in the first place, maybe Jessica would still be alive? What he was doing to Sam &mdash; keeping him in this life &mdash; maybe Chris had been right about what he&#39;d said at the hospital, maybe <em>that </em>was the worst and most selfish thing he could possibly do to his brother.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean kept telling himself he needed to keep Sam safe and, to keep him safe, he needed to keep him close&hellip; but perhaps keeping Sam in this life was playing right into the hands of the enemy. It was no secret the Yellow-Eyed Demon wanted Sam for something. Maybe Sam would actually be safer in this other life. Here, in this place, Sam had a chance. A future far from the world of demons and monsters and death. How could he be so selfish as to condemn Sam to a life with no future? A life of hunting was a life of suffering and sadness and sacrifice. Just because Dean didn&#39;t have a choice didn&#39;t mean Sam had to be fated to the same dead-end.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Squinting up at the sun, Dean sighed and pushed his dark thoughts away. Whatever happened, none of them could move forward until this case was solved. He owed Sam that much.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean swept the area carefully, his sharp eye scanning for anything unusual. All he could see were remnants of police tape and blood. Then again, the lack of certain things told him what it wasn&#39;t. There was no sign of sulfur, no physical claw marks or anything that would indicate something strictly corporeal. Nothing much at all had been disturbed. Just as he turned to go, his eyes fell on a manhole cover. Walking closer to take a look, Dean could see a gooey, tar-like substance on the edges.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">He flicked his knife open as he crouched to get a better look. Using the knife blade, he scraped some of the black slime off and held it in front of his face, sniffing at it. Ectoplasm &mdash; had to be. Despite the weird widening of the hunting grounds, this would mean something more of the spirit variety and definitely something seriously angry and old. Dean wiped the blade off, deciding to make a few more stops before heading back to Sam.</p><p data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"" style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m48/NovembersGuest/Icons%20and%20stuff/ImpalaBARfinal.png"" style=""width: 584px; height: 37px;"" /></p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam blinked hard against the harsh, late-afternoon sun stabbing through the crack in the curtains. Sitting up, he automatically glanced at the other bed. It was empty. He looked around, finding the rest of the room, including the bathroom, empty as well. Scrubbing his face with his hands, he scooted to the edge of his bed and tried to remember what had happened. He remembered drinking with Nathan and then arguing with Dean. Lori had been here and <em>then</em> they had argued and his brother had left.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Looking at the clock beside him, his heart somersaulted when he realized Dean had been gone for hours. Grabbing his phone, he looked down to see he had two voice-mails. Hoping it was Dean, he dialed to listen and waited.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><em>You have two new messages. First message: </em></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><em>Hey Sam, it&#39;s Becky. Do you think &mdash; can you come to the hospital? Please. Aaron &mdash; oh, Sam, the doctors don&#39;t know what happened, he was doing okay and then he wasn&#39;t. They say he&#39;s fallen into a coma. Please come.</em></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><em>Next message:</em></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><em>Hey, it&#39;s Nathan. What&#39;s your brother doing at the apartments? I saw him pull up on my way out. Hope he doesn&#39;t run into Chris. Anyway, I guess if he&#39;s got the car, you might need a lift to the hospital, which is why I&#39;m calling. I assume you heard about Aaron? Give me call, bro, and I&#39;ll swing by and pick you up.</em></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><em>End of messages.</em></p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Dammit, Dean!&quot; Sam exploded, throwing his phone and watching it bounce harmlessly on the bed. &quot;Stupid jerk! Pig-headed, stubborn&mdash;&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">He shook his head, regretted that instantly and settled for pinching his nose and breathing in and out. Big, deep breaths.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;I can&#39;t do this right now,&quot; he mumbled to himself. Picking up the phone, he punched the keys a little harder than necessary.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Hey, it&#39;s Sam. I called to see if that offer still stands? Man, I really appreciate it &mdash; you have no idea. See you in ten.&quot;</p><p data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"" style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m48/NovembersGuest/Icons%20and%20stuff/ImpalaBARfinal.png"" style=""width: 584px; height: 37px;"" /></p><p style=""text-align: left;"">The minute Dean stepped inside the apartment complex, he felt a jolt of unease ripple up his spine. Sam was probably right, it was stupid coming here alone. But, this is where he needed to be. Not just because it was the best chance at a real clue, but also because he felt drawn &mdash; <em>compelled</em> &mdash; to be here.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">He jumped hard when a hand clamped down on his shoulder and whirled him around.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;What the hell&mdash;&quot; he spluttered.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Chris&#39;s face was a thunderstorm. &quot;What are you doing here, Winchester?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Shoving Chris&#39;s arm off, Dean growled back, &quot;Get off me. I don&#39;t answer to you, college boy. What I do is none of your damn business.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">They glared at each other, chests heaving and eyes sparking.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;It <em>is</em> when you&#39;re poking your nose where it doesn&#39;t belong.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Drawing a deep breath through his nose, Dean took a step back. &quot;Look, man, I get that you watch out for your friends &mdash; it&#39;s admirable, really &mdash; but I have a job to do. That&#39;s all. Now if you don&#39;t mind&mdash;&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Not so fast&mdash;&quot; Chris stopped him with a hand on the cuff of his jacket.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">With a fierce jolt, anger snapped through Dean and, before he knew it, he had Chris held firmly against the wall, his forearm pressed tightly across Chris&#39;s throat. &quot;Listen, I ain&#39;t got time for this. Every minute we waste, someone else could die. Now, I listened to what you had to say at the hospital and maybe you&#39;re right about some things. But Sam&#39;s <em>my</em> brother and it&#39;s <em>my</em> job to protect him, not yours. And the best thing for him right now? Is for me to go up to that apartment, figure this out and kill it so we can all get back to our lives. Are we clear?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Chris visibly swallowed, then stiffly nodded his head. Dean searched his face, flexing his arm, then drew back and let him go with a pat to his chest. &quot;Good.&quot; He gave a brief, fake smile.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Once again, as he stepped away, he felt a hand on his arm &mdash; hesitant this time.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;I&#39;m going with you,&quot; Chris said. &quot;Sam&#39;s my friend and if that apartment is the key to helping him, then I&#39;m in.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean paused. Aaron had been hurt the last time he&#39;d acquiesced and he really didn&#39;t need another thing piled on his guilt list. He really needed the backup, but was the risk worth it?</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Look man, either you let me go with you or I&#39;m just going to make trouble for you. It&#39;s your choice.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">The stubborn set to Chris&#39;s face told Dean he meant it. He had no doubt the guy could cause all kinds of trouble if he so chose. After another second of indecision, Dean shrugged. &quot;Your funeral, dude. Just&hellip; stay behind me, do as I say and stay out of my way.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">He didn&#39;t wait for an answer and this time when he turned, Chris followed.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">By the time they had climbed the stairs halfway, Dean was feeling lightheaded and shaky. Each step closer had an undeniable effect on him &mdash; stronger than before. He rubbed his fingers against the thoughts chanting in his head &mdash; Sam&#39;s voice, Jessica, his own thoughts swirling around, urging him forward (help me, <em>please</em>) and pushing him back (don&#39;t do anything stupid). Chris had fallen into silence behind him, but Dean could feel his eyes on him, assessing and perceptive. Dean had a feeling the dude didn&#39;t miss much and he wondered if he was passing or failing whatever test Chris held him to.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">They both jumped when Dean&#39;s phone began playing loudly in his pocket. Fishing it out, he saw it was Sam. He was still trying to decide whether or not to answer it when it went to voice-mail. A bad feeling crept over him and he shivered. Pressing buttons, he listened as Sam&#39;s voice blast through the earpiece.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;<em>I know where you are and we&#39;ll be talking about it later.&quot; </em>There was a long pause wherein Dean could hear Sam taking a shaky breath<em>. &quot;I got a call from Becky&hellip; Aaron&#39;s slipped into a coma. It doesn&#39;t look good. I&#39;m on my way to the hospital right now. Meet me there or I swear to God, I&#39;ll come and get you myself.&quot;</em></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><em>Click. End of messages.</em></p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Dammit.&quot; Dean grit his teeth, lips pulled back in a grimace. Flipping the phone shut, he clutched his fist around it, making his knuckles go white.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;What? What&#39;s going on?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">He turned to meet Chris&#39;s gaze. &quot;That was Sam. Aaron&#39;s not doing well &mdash; he&#39;s unconscious, a-a coma they think.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;What?! He was fine last night. He was &mdash; he joked around with us.&quot; Suddenly Chris&#39;s features morphed from surprised grief to anger. Poking a finger at Dean, he yelled, &quot;This is your fault! If he dies, it&#39;s on you. Do you destroy everything you touch? Jess? Sam? And now Aaron?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Chris&#39;s words slammed into Dean with a physical punch. He lifted a hand and pressed it against his stomach, staying the sickness that washed through him. Guilt curdled in his gut &mdash; deep down, these were things Dean always believed to be true. It wasn&#39;t the first time he&#39;d had similar thoughts, but he couldn&#39;t seem to shake it off like he usually did. He wanted it to stay buried in the darkest, secret shadows of his mind where it belonged.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Look,&quot; Dean growled, &quot;we don&#39;t have time for this. I&#39;m headed over to the hospital if you want a ride.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Looking at Dean with disgust, Chris snarled, &quot;No thanks, I&#39;d rather crawl on my hands and knees.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Chris turned his back on Dean and stormed down the stairs. When they reached the bottom floor, Dean caught Chris by the elbow.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;I can&#39;t let you drive like this.&quot; Chris tried to yank away, but Dean held tight, saying, &quot;Dude, don&#39;t be stupid, take the offer. You don&#39;t have to <em>like</em> me, you just have to get there alive.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean stared pointedly at Chris&#39;s trembling hands. Scowling, Chris clenched them into fists. &quot;Fine. But I don&#39;t owe you anything.&quot; He met Dean&#39;s eyes, resentment clear. Dean didn&#39;t bother to answer, just turned and led the way to the Impala.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">The ride to the hospital was uncomfortable at best. Dean tried to ignore Chris&#39;s presence while Chris stared resolutely out the passenger window, his posture stiff and defensive. Once they found the right waiting room, Dean hung back, watching as Chris enveloped Becky in a tight hug while Sam and Nathan looked on with grim faces. Becky&#39;s sobs and Chris&#39;s soft attempts to comfort her left him feeling like the worst kind of curse and he longed to be anywhere but there. He could feel Sam&#39;s gaze on him, but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to meet it. His emotions too close to the surface, Dean was afraid his brother would see it all laid bare if he dared to look up.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Hey, man.&quot; Sam bumped Dean&#39;s shoulder with his own, causing Dean to startle, head whipping up. He hadn&#39;t even realized Sam had moved. &quot;You alright?&quot; Sam squinted in the way that meant he was ferreting out cracks.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine.&quot; His voice chafed in his taut throat and he paused to clear it, glancing away. &quot;Any news?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam hesitated briefly before saying, &quot;No, just that the doctors aren&#39;t sure what happened. They&#39;re running more tests and are supposed to update us when they get the results.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;How much longer?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Well, it&#39;s been a couple of hours now, but who knows.&quot; The last was said with the beginning of a face-splitting yawn. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m still tired.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Yeah, well, you&#39;re still hung over, you big girl. How &#39;bout some coffee?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam threw Dean a grateful look. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;d be great. There&#39;s a coffee machine down by the elevators, I think.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam started forward, but Dean touched his forearm, glancing at the others as he said, &quot;You stay here, I&#39;ll get it.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Uncertainty clouded Sam&#39;s eyes, questions forming on his lips. Just when Dean was certain Sam was going to ask questions he wouldn&#39;t &mdash; couldn&#39;t &mdash; answer, Chris approached them from behind, coming up to brush against Sam&#39;s arm. He shot a wary look at Dean before asking, &quot;You okay, Sam?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean didn&#39;t wait for Sam&#39;s response, glad for the reprieve <em>and</em> chance to escape the heavy pall in the air. He slipped quietly from the room while his brother&#39;s attention was diverted and breathed a little easier with each step that took him <em>away</em>. He didn&#39;t <em>belong</em> and he wasn&#39;t in full command of himself to keep his unease hidden. He bee-lined for the nearest bathrooms, needing a breather, just a minute to splash some water on his face and settle himself before searching out the coffee machines. Luckily, he didn&#39;t have to go far to find what he was looking for.</p><p data-mce-style=""text-align: center;"" style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m48/NovembersGuest/Icons%20and%20stuff/ImpalaBARfinal.png"" style=""width: 584px; height: 37px;"" /></p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;How&#39;re you holding up?&quot; Dean asked when he got back. He handed the muddy coffee to his brother and studied the way Sam leaned against the wall, hands dug deep in his pockets, shoulders rounded in a hunch. Misery at its finest.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam clenched his jaw, but nodded, letting his floppy hair fall across his face, obscuring his eyes as he stared into his cup. After a long silence, he murmured, &quot;I just don&#39;t understand.&quot; His breath hitched making the next words dissolve into a whisper. &quot;Why is this happening? Why now?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean didn&#39;t know what to say. He would take this pain from his brother if he could &mdash; but, as he was learning, not everything was within his control to fix. Such was this and he hated it. It smacked of failure. He felt a thread of anger begin to form and he embraced it. Anger was something he knew, it was something he was comfortable expressing. Not like the squirm of feelings he&#39;d beaten into submission within the walls of the hospital&#39;s over-sanitized bathrooms. Maybe he couldn&#39;t shield Sam from this, but there was something he <em>could</em> <em>do </em>to end it.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;He&#39;s gonna be okay, Sam. I promise you, he&#39;s gonna be fine.&quot; Dean met Sam&#39;s eyes meaningfully before turning toward the door.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam grabbed his arm. &quot;Dean, wait. You are <em>not</em> going back there.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean let his arm hang in Sam&#39;s grasp. &quot;Yes, Sam, I am. You stay here and watch them. I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;No.&quot; Sam&#39;s eyes bored into Dean&#39;s. &quot;No, let&#39;s just talk about this, okay?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;What&#39;s to talk about? Something is killing people, hurting your friends. I&#39;m going to go kill it. End of story.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam scoffed. &quot;We don&#39;t even know what <em>it</em> is, much less how to kill it. And, if it&#39;s Jess&hellip;&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean tugged, trying to loosen Sam&#39;s grip. &quot;That hesitation right there? That&#39;s exactly why you need to stay out of this.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Don&#39;t do that,&quot; Sam growled. &quot;You don&#39;t get to use that against me.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Sam&mdash;&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Code blue, room 284,&quot; the speaker over their heads blared. &quot;Code blue, room 284.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Everyone in the room froze, their eyes glued to the personnel running past the door. Becky moved to stand next to Sam, her hand coming up to cover her mouth.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;We don&#39;t know it&#39;s him,&quot; Sam told her after a shocked minute, his arm falling away from Dean to encircle her shoulders. &quot;Becky,&quot; he jostled her. We don&#39;t know it&#39;s him.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Becky blinked. Meeting Sam&#39;s eyes, she said, &quot;We don&#39;t know it isn&#39;t.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">With that she made a choking sound that turned into a stifled sob. Sam took her in his arms and began rubbing circles into her back. At first, she stood stiffly, then collapsed against him, her fingers clawing into his shirt as she hid her face in his shoulder.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sorrow pressed into Dean&#39;s chest &ndash; the ache of it made his breath stutter. His vision blurred and pressure spiked sharply in his head. Everything around him faded into the background and time slowed, syrup thick. Lifting a hand to his head, he pressed against his temple with his palm, shaking his head as if that would loosen the sensation.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Dean?&quot; Sam&#39;s asked.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean looked up, found Sam&#39;s features blurring in and out of focus; the room spun dizzily. Clamoring for an anchor, he let his gaze drift first to Nathan, his puzzled eyes peering at him over Sam&#39;s shoulder, and then to Chris who glared daggers, as he always seemed to be doing. Chris&#39;s annoyance faded with eye contact and Dean didn&#39;t know what to make of that. Even Becky seemed to sense something was wrong as she turned in Sam&#39;s embrace, blinking red, wet eyes at him.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;I&hellip;&quot; he began, his vision whiting out completely. He felt himself sway unsteadily before a solid grip caught him at the elbows.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Hey, answer me!&quot; he heard from afar, the words buried under a stark numbness settling over his senses. Cutting, bright pain seared through his head, a fiery lightning bolt blistering his synapses until he couldn&#39;t help the groan that escaped. Distantly, he could hear voices continuing to buzz around him; Sam&#39;s distinct above the rest, commanding, &quot;No, I&#39;ve got him. Someone close that door.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean blinked spots from his eyes as the light finally dimmed, gathering in on itself until it solidified into a hazy shape.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Jessica.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;&hellip;hear me? Dean, listen&hellip;&quot; Her mouth continued to shape the plea, but her words were swept away as surely as if a swift gale had stolen them.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Jessica,&quot; he began, bringing his other hand up to press into his skull. &quot;Hurts, please&hellip;&quot; he shook his head at her.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;&hellip;sorry, can&#39;t&hellip; must stop&hellip; please!&quot; She advanced on him until his knees finally gave way; he felt himself falling and then he wasn&#39;t.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Suddenly, it was like being in two places at once. Jessica was still begging him to hear her as she stutter-shifted closer, her blonde hair and white dress whipping all around, but, superimposed on top of her image, was Sam&#39;s. It was Sam&#39;s concerned face that yelled something Dean couldn&#39;t quite catch, his fingers digging past Dean&#39;s sleeves into his flesh. He knew the instant their skin made contact. Sam stiffened and his attention abruptly veered to Jessica.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Jess&hellip;&quot; Sam whispered, and that came through loud and clear. She flickered then reappeared near enough to touch. All around her, thick smoke and angry flames came into acute focus, licking at her hair and clothes, but she didn&#39;t appear to be in any pain. This close, the rush of agony in his head flowed fast and furious&hellip; it occurred to him that maybe the harsh, awful noise in his ears was himself. He must&#39;ve closed his eyes because now Sam was gone. He could only <em>see</em> her.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Please,&quot; Sam begged, his voice floating down from somewhere above, &quot;you&#39;re hurting him. Stop.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">She reached out, fingers coming to rest where Sam&#39;s grip pulled up his sleeve, right where the skin was bare. Her touch was painfully, shockingly icy even though the heat from the flames blasted hot against his face. His body electrified beneath her touch. He shook, felt his muscles lock and tighten &mdash; but for one moment, her words were perfectly clear even though her lips did not move.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Dean, they will all die,&quot; whispered through his mind. &quot;Please <em>see</em>.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Then Dean did see. A dark shadow loomed behind her, almost out of eye-shot. Sickening apprehension roiled in Dean&#39;s stomach and he heard himself whimper. He recoiled from the <em>wrong, wicked, perverse,</em> tumbling through his mind.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Jess, you&#39;re killing him. Please, baby, stop.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam&#39;s desperate voice filled his ears, the clench of his fingers painful against Dean&#39;s over-sensitized skin. Amazingly, Jess seemed to hear him this time.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Sam?&quot; she whispered, her surprised eyes bouncing away from Dean.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Yes, it&#39;s me,&quot; Sam whispered back. &quot;You can hear me?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Her face broke into a brilliant smile, the edges of it wobbling and her eyes welling up.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Sam.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Jessica reached out with her free hand and instantly Sam reappeared beneath her touch. Dean had just enough time to register it before an arc of energy seared through him &mdash; his body bowed and his eyes clamped tight against everything until there was nothing. He didn&#39;t know how long he drifted there, floating in a vacuum, but it didn&#39;t really seem to matter all that much.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">After a while, the world slowly faded back in. Awareness sharpened &mdash; the cold floor seeped through his jeans and into his skin, bleeding away what little warmth was left in him and he shivered. A dull murmur clarified into words and then a voice. Hands shook him lightly, prompting him to open his eyes and look up into Sam&#39;s worried face. His brother was holding a tissue beneath his nose, catching the last trickle of blood. Behind Sam stood Nathan, looking utterly panicked, and, kneeling across from Sam, was Becky.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Hey,&quot; she called softly when his eyes caught on hers, &quot;you back with us?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean&#39;s gaze shifted to Sam &mdash; the deep lines grooved between his brother&#39;s eyebrows made him want to reach up and smooth them away with a thumb. Dean tried to speak, wanting to reassure him, but all that came out was a ragged cough. He swallowed and almost gagged, finding his mouth cotton dry, his throat ragged and raw.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;He needs something to drink,&quot; Sam ordered over his shoulder as he pulled away the tissues and wadded them into a ball.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean didn&#39;t know who he spoke to, but a half-full water bottle appeared between them. Sam eased Dean up and helped him drink the tepid water. It tasted like heaven.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;You okay?&quot; Sam finally asked, his own voice jagged on the edges.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam&#39;s grip gentled on his arm but stayed in place and Becky rubbed lightly up and down his leg. He&#39;d scared them good. He nodded, acutely embarrassed and taken aback by the attention. His head still rang like a bell and he tried to blink away the dizziness, desperate to regain the lie of being in control.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m okay,&quot; he drawled out slowly, sounding a little drunk.&quot;Wh-what happened?&quot; he asked, feeling unsure of his own senses.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam settled back on his legs and shook his head, a tiny movement. &quot;You gave me a heart attack is what happened.&quot; He paused, then asked, &quot;Are you <em>sure</em> you&#39;re okay?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean didn&#39;t say anything about the cold biting into him, how his brain was addled and foggy &mdash; he certainly didn&#39;t mention the pulsing burn left by Jessica&#39;s touch or how his body felt heavy with gravity, like he was being dragged down with every breath.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Instead, he said, &quot;Yeah. I&#39;m sure. Help me up?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">He jiggled his arm still in Sam&#39;s grasp, motivating his brother into levering them both to their feet. He suppressed the urge to flatten his palm against the shifting sands in his head and looked around the room, thankfully still empty except for them. The door that had been propped open was now shut, giving them the illusion of privacy. Chris was standing uneasily next to it, soberly watching the group. Everyone looked unhinged and Dean worried maybe he&#39;d misunderstood their earlier concern.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;What is it? Is it Aaron?&quot; Dean asked as he sunk into the nearest chair, tolerating Sam&#39;s hovering with silence.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Uh,&quot; Sam started, his gaze shifting worriedly between Becky and Dean. &quot;We don&#39;t know &mdash; it&#39;s only been a few minutes and we kinda had our hands full.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean grimaced in confusion. &quot;What? What do you mean?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;It&#39;s only been a few minutes from the time we heard the code until now. Nobody has had time to check.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Minutes?&quot; Dean asked, mind replaying what he remembered. &quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam&#39;s face pinched into unease as he took the seat next to him. &quot;How long do you think it&#39;s been?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean scrubbed his face with his right hand, thinking it through. &quot;I don&#39;t know exactly. But it felt like quite a while, maybe a half hour at least?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">This time Sam&#39;s eyebrows both shot up. &quot;What? Okay, wait, what makes you think that?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean gestured with his open hand. &quot;I-I&#39;m not sure.&quot; At the growing distress on Sam&#39;s face, he hastened to add, &quot;It&#39;s probably nothing. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a&mdash;&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Look,&quot; Chris broke in, &quot;I think the important thing right now is to find out about Aaron. Can we just do that first?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Chris&mdash;&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;No, Becky &mdash; I know you&#39;re worried. Whatever that was,&quot; he flung his arm out toward Sam and Dean, &quot;he seems okay right now. The rest can wait until we know Aaron&#39;s okay.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam looked at Dean and Dean nodded. &quot;Yeah, go with &#39;em. I&#39;ll be here when you get back.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam looked skeptical, beacons of doubt clear in his eyes.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Go on,&quot; Dean pushed, shoving at Sam&#39;s shoulder until he relented enough to stand. &quot;I swear I&#39;m okay, okay?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;You&#39;d better be here,&quot; Sam said curtly. &quot;I mean, it, Dean. Don&#39;t move a muscle until I get back.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean shrugged as if to say, &#39;where am I gonna go?&#39; But Sam continued to scowl until Dean threw up his hands and spat, &quot;Fine, I get it.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">As soon as Sam walked out of the room, Dean scrubbed a hand through his hair back and forth and leaned forward, elbows on his knees. <em>I can do this</em>, he repeated over and over to himself,<em> I can do this, no problem</em>. He could be still for a few minutes and be a good, dutiful brother. That&#39;s what he told himself, but soon his legs were doing a nervous dance without his permission. Thoughts and worries crowded into his mind like beetles crawling under his skin &mdash; scratching and gnawing away at his raw innards. He couldn&#39;t push them away fast or far enough.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Nothing made any sense anymore. The case, him and Sam, whatever was happening to him &mdash; nothing. He felt lost &mdash; he felt alone. The crushing, constant weariness ravaged his defenses and he could be honest with <em>himself</em> about that if no one else. This case was getting to him in new and fantastically hellish ways and sitting here doing nothing intensified the feeling if only because it gave him too much time to think. He tried to concentrate on positive thoughts, tried to keep himself distracted, but the quiet of the room took on a life of its own. It pressed into him until his chest felt heavy, constricted, and he couldn&#39;t get enough air into his lungs. The walls were closing in &mdash; his skin crawled, he was suffocating. He needed out. He needed fresh air. <em>Now-now-now</em>. Hoping Sam wouldn&#39;t eat him alive for disappearing, Dean sprinted for the nearest exit.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">The sensation of time slowing down hit him again in the elevator, more potent this time &mdash; his distress must&#39;ve shown because the lady with the rain slicker kept throwing him funny looks the entire ride down. Stumbling out the door into the lengthening evening, he closed his eyes and drew in deep, greedy breaths. He listened to the traffic on the street and let the thrum of the city fill his head. Every now and then, the hiss of the sliding glass door behind him would announce the presence of people leaving or entering the building &mdash; sometimes it was squeaking sneakers and sometimes it was clicking heels.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">The air was thick with moisture that clung to his skin; the temperature eased with the deepening of oncoming night, a promise of cool rippling in currents. The cusp of twilight &mdash; his favorite time of day. The knot in his chest loosened ever so slightly and he exhaled his relief. Opening his eyes, he noticed the pavement sparkled with fading, scattered sunbeams and water droplets &mdash; puddles marked the dips and cracks in the cement. When had it rained? For that matter, why was he damp?</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Looking himself over, he realized it must&#39;ve been sprinkling when he came out and he hadn&#39;t even noticed. In his pocket, his cell phone beeped, letting him know he had a message waiting. Pulling it out of his pocket, he pressed the button and read Sam&#39;s angry text: &quot;U said u&#39;d wait. Where r u asshole?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean thumbed a quick text back: &quot;Outside &mdash; needed some air. Brb. Bitch.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">A few seconds passed as he waited for the expected reply, but it never came. Stuffing the phone back into his pocket, he slid his eyes over the glistening cars and stared into the setting sun for a minute longer. At least, he hoped it was only a minute &mdash; he had the unnerving feeling that he couldn&#39;t be sure anymore. Shivering, he buried his hands into his pockets and made his way back to the waiting room.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">All eyes found him the minute he walked in, but Dean blocked out all but one pair. Sam&#39;s jaw line was stiff and he didn&#39;t know if that meant bad news about Aaron or if his brother was just pissed at him for not being where he&#39;d left him.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dropping into the seat next to Sam, Dean knocked his elbow against his brother&#39;s arm.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Well, what&#39;s the news?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam breathed through his nose, his lips thinning out. &quot;The code was Aaron&hellip;&quot; He swallowed a couple of times, the frown curled between his brows deepening. Dean waited patiently for him to find his voice, his eyes glued to his face. &quot;His heart had stopped, but they got him back. He&#39;s stable right now. His condition is about the same as it was when we got here &ndash;- no real change and no answers about what&#39;s going on with him. His doctors don&#39;t know what to make of it.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean bowed his head as he curled his lips in, valiantly trying to keep his emotions tamped down. He didn&#39;t want to say it, but to him it seemed awfully suspicious that Aaron would code the minute Jessica made her presence known. Maybe if he hadn&#39;t been here, it wouldn&#39;t have happened. Still didn&#39;t make sense, though. This wasn&#39;t how things worked. Nothing about this followed the rules. It was like shooting in the dark with a blind fold.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;They&#39;re going to let us visit him two at time as soon as the doctor has finished,&quot; Sam was saying.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Well, that&#39;s good, right?&quot; Dean asked. &quot;They wouldn&#39;t let you in if he wasn&#39;t stable.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Dean&#39;s right,&quot; Nathan said from Sam&#39;s other side. &quot;They wouldn&#39;t let non-family members visit if he wasn&#39;t at least stable. Has anyone contacted his family?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Becky nodded immediately. &quot;Yeah, I called them, but even if they left immediately, they won&#39;t be able to get in before the weekend. I&#39;m hoping he&#39;ll be better by then.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Everyone nodded, their faces set into the resolute masks of people who refused any other reality. Everyone, that is, but Sam who vibrated with a carefully controlled slow-burn of anger. Hot magma deep inside the volcanic chamber. Dean winced inwardly, knowing this was the worst facet of angry Sam.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;I&#39;m gonna go get some coffee,&quot; Chris said after an uncomfortable silence dragged on too long. &quot;Becky? Want me to get you something?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">She shook her head. &quot;Not coffee, no. I&#39;m too keyed up. Maybe some water?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Sure, I can do that. Be right back,&quot; he said, backing out the door.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;I&#39;ll come with,&quot; Nathan said, jumping up like a nervous frog. Chris didn&#39;t look too thrilled, but he didn&#39;t say anything as Nathan joined him.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">As if just noticing, Sam unclenched long enough to frown at Dean&#39;s damp clothes and hair. &quot;Why are you wet?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Uh&hellip;&quot; Dean scratched behind his ear, screwing up his face. &quot;It&#39;s been raining&hellip; well, misting by the time I got outside.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;You&#39;ve been standing out in the rain all this time?&quot; Sam&#39;s voice held disbelief and chastisement.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Misting, Sam. Just a light mist &mdash; and it&#39;s warm out. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m in danger of catching a cold or something.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Then why are you shivering, huh? Got an explanation for that?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam was being entirely too smug. Dean rolled his eyes, his gaze falling on Becky across the room watching them. &quot;My brother, the mother hen,&quot; Dean mocked with a shrug in her direction.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">A tentative smile touched her lips. &quot;Yeah, that seems to be a consistent Sam Winchester trait.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Beside him, Sam huffed and rolled his eyes at both of them. Becky pushed away from the wall she&#39;d been leaning against and moved closer, her arms falling away from where they&#39;d been crossed over her chest.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;But he&#39;s right, Dean. Even I can see you&#39;re shivering&hellip; and it&#39;s not cold in here. At all.&quot; She made a point of pulling her hair away from her neck to fan the damp skin there.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam snorted and narrowed a glare Dean&#39;s way.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean dropped his eyes, picking at a hangnail on his thumb. He really didn&#39;t need this kind of attention; he had no answers to give or re-directions up his sleeve &mdash; and he was far too smart to shoot himself in the foot by telling the truth.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Hesitant, she sat across from them. &quot;What was that a while ago? I mean, I don&#39;t understand what that was&mdash;&quot; She held up a hand before either of them could say anything. &quot;And, don&#39;t tell me that was just some medical condition left over from the car accident. I know what I saw and that wasn&#39;t&hellip; <em>normal</em>. You were in pain, a lot of pain. And you both said Jessica&#39;s name&hellip; it was like you were talking <em>to</em> her.&quot; Becky took a breath before adding, &quot;She was my friend. I cared about her, too, so I deserve to know.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean exchanged looks with Sam, then asked, &quot;So all that really did happen, then? You saw her&hellip; and <em>she</em> <em>saw you</em>?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam nodded, his demeanor thawing ever so slightly. &quot;Yeah. But it all happened so fast &mdash; it was only a few minutes. What made you think otherwise?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Hey, guys,&quot; Becky snapped her fingers between them. &quot;Still here&hellip; still waiting on an answer.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam raised his brows at Dean, asking permission, and Dean nodded, rubbing his hands across the top of his thighs &mdash; his body outwardly bracing for whatever reaction was forthcoming.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Well, it&#39;s a long story, but the short of it is, Dean&#39;s been seeing Jess&#39;s spirit.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Becky gasped.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;What?! I mean, how&hellip; why? I thought you were the one with psychic powers?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Like I said, it&#39;s complicated. Very, very complicated.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m getting that,&quot; she muttered.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;The thing is,&quot; Sam said, sharing a glance with Dean, &quot;we&#39;re not entirely sure what&#39;s going on. It&#39;s like Jess has latched on to Dean, but we don&#39;t know why. It doesn&#39;t make sense &mdash; she barely knew him. The only thing we know is since the accident, Dean&#39;s become&hellip; a lightning rod for the paranormal.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Becky&#39;s head tipped forward even as her eyebrows rose. &quot;Is that the same as you?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;No, not <em>visions</em> &mdash; it&#39;s more like he&#39;s able to pick up supernatural signals&hellip;like he&#39;s a magnet for them. And he doesn&#39;t just see ghosts, apparently he can connect to them on their plane of existence.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Okay,&quot; she drew out. &quot;But is it supposed to hurt like that &mdash; or is Jess doing it on purpose?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean shook his head, intent on squashing that line of thought. &quot;It&#39;s not on purpose.&quot; Hesitating, he glanced at Sam. &quot;I think she&#39;s asking for help. Or she&#39;s trying to help <em>us</em>.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam&#39;s head jerked. &quot;What?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Shrugging, Dean said, &quot;You saw her, Sam. She didn&#39;t look like she was trying to hurt me. She didn&#39;t look angry &mdash; she looked scared. The last thing she said to me was, &#39;they will all die,&#39; but it didn&#39;t seem like a threat &mdash; felt more like a warning. I think she&#39;s just desperate and doesn&#39;t realize she&#39;s hurting me.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Okay, but what does that mean?&quot; Sam asked, his eyes holding too much hope. Dean&#39;s heart thumped in his chest and he felt a blunt pang - how he prayed he wasn&#39;t encouraging misplaced hope.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he said. &quot;What I do know is that this time, when she touched me, I could hear everything she said clearly&hellip; like the direct contact completed some kind of circuit between us. I think that&#39;s why she could see you. But she was definitely asking for help, I could <em>feel</em> it.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean could see Sam desperately wanting to believe, but struggling. &quot;Maybe she knows she&#39;s out of control and she&#39;s asking us to stop her?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Tipping his head in acknowledgment, Dean agreed, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s a possibility. But that doesn&#39;t explain why I found ectoplasm at Julia&#39;s crime scene&hellip;or what I saw.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;What you saw?&quot; Sam repeated. &quot;At the crime scene or...&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;She told me to &#39;see,&#39;&quot; Dean said, &quot;before she noticed you &mdash; she said &#39;see&#39; and I did. When I looked, I saw something hovering behind her. It was a dark shape, like a shadow. It could&#39;ve been anything, but my gut tells me it&#39;s something. Something not good. It made me feel...&quot; Words didn&#39;t even begin to cover it, so he let the sentence hang. Shaking his head, he looked at Sam and continued, &quot;I think we need to consider the possibility that Jessica is warning us against something else.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam and Becky stared wide-eyed at him, their faces completely gob-smacked.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam stuttered, &quot;S-so you&#39;re thinking&hellip;what? That something is controlling her?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Is that possible?&quot; Becky blurt. &quot;How is that possible?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know. Maybe its controlling her, maybe its not - I just know she <em>wanted</em> me to see it. And I think I should stay away from the hospital.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;What? Why would you&hellip;&quot; Sam asked, leaning forward. Then, frowning, jumped to the right conclusions. &quot;Wh&mdash;wait a minute, you think Aaron coded because of you?&quot; When Dean didn&#39;t say anything, he went on, &quot;That&#39;s crazy, Dean. Why would you think something like that?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know, maybe because he was stable when I got here, but the minute Jessica entered the picture, he coded and when she left, he stabilized. As long as <em>I&#39;m</em> here, we run the risk of drawing Jessica or whatever back&hellip; and if that&#39;s the reason for Aaron&hellip;&quot; He shrugged again as if it made perfect sense.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;It&#39;s just coincidence.&quot; Sam&#39;s voice lowered. &quot;You can&#39;t possibly know that it&#39;s anything more than that.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;All I&#39;m saying is it&#39;s not worth risking. You can stay here as long as you need to, but I think I should go back to the motel &mdash; maybe do some more research.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Sam&#39;s face morphed into hard lines and cement corners. &quot;You are not going back to the apartment &mdash; <em>especially</em> not alone. That would be <em>beyond</em> stupid.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean smiled what he hoped was something reassuring and, ignoring the physical repulsion of what he was about to do, said, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s why I&#39;m just gonna cool it at the room. Really, I&#39;ll just take a nap and then poke around on the laptop. I have a few ideas I&#39;d like to look up - see if I can get a lead on our mysterious shadow.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">He kept the smile in place but felt guilt slide into his gut as he watched his brother agonize over wanting to believe him and knowing better. It was true that he felt his presence was a risk to Aaron, but he had no intention of napping or sitting on his thumbs. They stared at each other a long minute before Sam finally nodded.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Okay. But keep your phone on and don&#39;t go <em>anywhere</em> without me.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Sure thing, Sammy.&quot; Dean stood and stretched like maybe the only thing on his mind was a nice long meet and greet with the bed. Before he left, he gripped Becky&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry about Aaron &mdash; but we&#39;re gonna figure this out and stop it. Okay?&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Becky smiled sadly and nodded. &quot;Yeah, I know you will.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean didn&#39;t look back as he walked out the door, but he could feel Sam&#39;s piercing gaze the whole way. Turning the corner too quick, he nearly crashed into Chris who had obviously been standing there for a while, eavesdropping. Chris&#39;s eyes flickered over Dean knowingly.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;I&#39;m coming with you,&quot; he said.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Back to the motel? Kinky.&quot; Dean smirked as he tried to shuffle further from the door.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Chris moved in front of him and stared back coolly until Dean started to worry their stalemate would draw attention.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;d be a little obvious us leaving at the same time? Together?&quot; Dean asked. &quot;They&#39;ll be expecting you to stay until you see Aaron.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Chris shrugged. &quot;It could be hours before they get in&hellip; and this way, Becky can stay in the room and let Sam and Nathan take turns. I&#39;ll just tell &#39;em I&#39;m having you give me a ride home to take care of some important business I forgot. I can always come back later.&quot;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean finally relented. Spreading his hands out palms up, he said, &quot;Knock yourself out.&quot; Then, with a cheeky twitch lifting the corner of his mouth, he pointed a finger at the other man and said, &quot;I&#39;ll be in the car with bells on. Don&#39;t make me wait.&quot; With that he brushed by Chris, making purposeful, solid contact with his shoulder.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Ten minutes later, Chris pulled the passenger door open and climbed in.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&quot;Okay, Winchester, show me what you&#39;ve got,&quot; he challenged, eyes glittering in the half-light.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dean smiled sideways, gunned the Impala and peeled away from the curve, tires squealing loudly across the parking lot.</p>

Close to my skin
I&rsquo;m falling in
Someone who&rsquo;s been

Sittin&rsquo; by the phone
I&rsquo;m left alone
In another zone

John says to live above hell
My will is well

No one is waiting
For me to fail
My will could sail yeah

It&rsquo;s such a waste to be wasted

Being face to face with common grace
To meditate on the warmest dream
And when I walk alone I listen
To our secret theme

Your solar eyes are like
Nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close
That can see right through
I&rsquo;d take a fall and you know
That I&rsquo;d do anything
I will for you

Sailin&rsquo; for the sun
&rsquo;Cause There is one
Knows where I&rsquo;m from

I care for you
I really do I really do

Come closer now
So you can lie
Right by my side

Sit alone in the sun
I wrote a letter to you
Getting over myself


Back to Chorus

Close to my skin
Someone who&rsquo;s been
I&rsquo;m a falling in

Disasters are
Just another star
Falling in my yard

by Mumford &amp; Sons</span>

And after the storm,
I run and run as the rains come
And I look up, I look up,
on my knees and out of luck,
I look up.

Night has always pushed up day
You must know life to see decay
But I won&#39;t rot, I won&#39;t rot
Not this mind and not this heart,
I won&#39;t rot.

And I took you by the hand
And we stood tall,
And remembered our own land,
What we lived for.

And there will come a time, you&#39;ll see, with no more tears.
And love will not break your heart, but dismiss your fears.
Get over your hill and see what you find there,
With grace in your heart and flowers in your hair.

And now I cling to what I knew
I saw exactly what was true
But oh no more.
That&#39;s why I hold,
That&#39;s why I hold with all I have.
That&#39;s why I hold.

And I won&#39;t die alone and be left there.
Well I guess I&#39;ll just go home,
Oh God knows where.
Because death is just so full and man so small.
Well I&#39;m scared of what&#39;s behind and what&#39;s before.

And there will come a time, you&#39;ll see, with no more tears.
And love will not break your heart, but dismiss your fears.
Get over your hill and see what you find there,
With grace in your heart and flowers in your hair.

And there will come a time, you&#39;ll see, with no more tears.
And love will not break your heart, but dismiss your fears.
Get over your hill and see what you find there,
With grace in your heart and flowers in your hair."

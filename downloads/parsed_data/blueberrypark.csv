I keep trying to make myself post that up on facebook.

But I can't. 
There's a sort of finality associated with that statement that i just refuse to admit.

Everytime i manage to convince myself to be strong. Put it into words and make it official.
I just can't.

It's cause deep down i still like her. But i dont know why.
I used to be so sure. But now the distance is greater and i'm not sure why.
Is it me or is it her.
God it's so confusing.

When you take away all the big things. You realise it's all the little things that made you like a person.
When you take away the warm talks and hugs and kisses.
I find that i miss her cleanliness, punctuality, that she likes pickles and olives. Even all the mind games (kind of).

And at this point i dont know whether to fight it out. or just cut and run.
But i told myself a long time ago that if she liked me less than i did her i would fight it out.
What frightens me now is that she doesn't like me at all.
And i'm just bashing myself against a wall.

I guess it would be nice if this is what coma patients really go through.  No wonder most of them don't wake up.

Anyway i guess i should just be really grateful whatever the ultimate situation might be.
Everyone's been telling me how lucky i am and how it's all probably a sign that i should get my life in order.

And i actually do kind of believe them.  Looking at the pics it's hard not to think that some random god/spirit/deity/genie-in-a-bottle was watching out for me.  By all regards i should have at least some broken bones, or a concussion or even be dead.

To walk away with just some scratches is pretty remarkable.
Oh. and everyone else in the car was just as fine too.

So i've kinda settled into a pretty routine lifestyle already.  Working 7-5, Mondays - Fridays.  Chilling out on weekends and eating waffles on Tuesdays.  It's fun .. but.. it's just not complete haha.  I guess life does need a bit of adventure now and then.  I really need to go do something that i wouldn't usually dare to do or that i've always wanted to do and haven't.  <-- Procrastinating.

So what was my first impression?

""LOL MUDsLINGING!""

seriously, its like some wow forum e-peen contest.. it's just funny.. i mean they're supposed to be 'celebrities' but the way they act is exactly the same as some cut noob.  Cept in this case instead of crying about skill they cry about sluttiness and plastic surgery.

SPEAKING of which.. OHMYGOD i had no idea so many of our young artistes have gone for plastic surgery, like seriously.. the channel8 9pm show? they make it sounds like all of them have gone under the knife. 'so what's so damning about it, everyones doing it^^'.  I'll never look at anything the same way again.. next time i see some cute girl on the street my first thought will probably be whether she's had her eyelids cut, or her nose changed. hmmm..

Another thing that struck me was that these girls talk about plastic surgery like other people talk about bodykits on car forums.  i'd know cause i actually did alot of reasearch on the subject..... bodykits that is, not plastic surgery.  Anyway they're all like, i didnt like my nose so i got it changed.. like WTF change a nose.. that idea has always been the weirdest to me.. cause unlike other things like eyelids, or lips or even boobs.  a nose to me seems like something vaguely er.. 'useful'.  Which is to say that most people use them for breathing, so i'm not sure how its working out for them.. but personally i think i'd feel abit weird breathing through a piece of plastic.  i wonder if they can actually get feeling.. hmm..

Another thing of importance recently is that i got into my first 'accident' the other day.. scrapped my bumper against a pillar and got a scratch for it.

Anywaaay.. i come back after leaving with the huge cliffhanger of 'omg ns is coming!!!!@~!'  Well i've finished by BMT and its safe to say that i've finally settled into my fairly stable job of 'i-dunno-if-i-should-say' cause the 'you-know-what' department might decide that my blog constitues a breach of national security and my next post might be made from the inside of a cell.

Suffice to say that my job is sufficently slacky (so far..), and its 8-5.. which means i get to sleep in my nice comfy bed everyday.  A luxury most of my ocs/sispec friends would kill for.  Anyway the food at camp is okay.. facilities are so-so.. i guess my only gripe is that the lack of physical activity is having a serious detrimental effect on my health.  One day i'm gonna be so slobbish that i'll be nothing by a cubicle warrior.

However i've decided that i actually feel like recording some random thoughts and feelings that i have in a semi-private manner.

My way of saying I care is <u>pretty unobvious.</u><br /><br />7. I try to spread love and happiness <u>and love and happiness spread me.. all over the sidewalk.</u><br /><br />8. Pick the flowers <u>since its cheap.. your girlfriend will love it xD</u><br /><br />9. To love someone <u>is to be willing to not love her, if it's what makes her happy.</u><br /><br />10. Beauty is <u>material.. material is good.</u><br /><br />11. When I was thirteen, what I remember the most was <u>hating ncc every friday of my sec1 life.</u><br /><br />12.

When I am happy, <u>i count the seconds for the feeling to fade.</u><br /><br />23. If only I don't have to care about <u>my future</u>, then i can be <u>enjoying the present.</u><br /><br />24. The best thing I did yesterday was to <u>sleep early and wake up late.</u><br /><br />25. If I ever write a book, I will give it this title, <u>From First-World to Third, The true story of how one man can screw up so badly: An Autobiography</u><br /><br />26. One thing I must do before I die is to <u>get a life.</u><br /><br />27. Doing this meme, <u>gave me a reason to blog.</u><br /><br />If you're reading this then feel free to do it."

"event","It's kinda ironic that i'm dishing out advice on dating and stuff
i mean.. its not like i had a very good track record or anything
pretty horrible actually if you ask me
anyhow

so i was thinking about it
and i suppose it actually is easier to think about love if you aren't emotionally attached
which is kinda an oxymoron, i know
or issit a paradox
whatever..

well.. its kinda funny actually
i mean.. staying detached is an effective way of looking at a relationship
but then again.. staying detached doesnt really make it one

In other news

I'm quite disgusted with a certain educational institute in a certain country which shall not be named to protect them as much as myself
This particular institution has apparently thought its found a brilliant way of keep tabs on their students
and that is , ironically, to read their blogs
i mean.. daamn.. what better way to dig up all the nitty-gritty details of your students lives than to invade their privacy and use their own reflections/posts as weapons against them

Yes i know a blog is a public place and that information should be free, yo.
But i'd like to think of a blog as a journal.. that is perhaps left unattended on a canteen table somewhere
The information has the potential to be freely accessible.. but you'd like to think that people would have the decency to respect your privacy
At the very least.. don't use what's in said journal as ammunition to cruicfy your students when you aren't even invited to read

I know alot of my friends have locked their journals in response to said party's intrusion into their privacy
It's not like they've ever posted anything particularly dissident or immoral
but i mean.. wtf.. this institution has shown that even the PHOTOS you post can be used against you
i don't see how they can insert their own opinions like.. oh i think these girls are sooo daring.. MOREPUNISHMENTPLZ.. and use that as justification

I for one am not going to lock my blog any time soon
cause firstly, i rarely say anything insulting on my blog
and secondly, if i do.. you probably wouldnt know about it

So get off my blog.. and start camping in toliets
who knows
you might actually find it more productive"

"event","It was a fun night i suppose, in more ways than one
cycling was pretty smooth cept for 1 or 2 breakdowns and a tired girl
but hey all in all it was a hell of an experience

the route was the same as last week
but i guess having more people made it more lively and fun
last week we had like what.. 7 people
now we have avg 10.. per group!
zing

so my group had like 2 IJ and 7 NYJC
but it was okay
NY people are really nice people
haha

ah well
tired now
gonna shower and sleep

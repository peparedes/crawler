"event","Saturday night without a doubt
was the craziest night of the week
mika sari and kristyn
couldn't have made it anymore sleek
 
why it was joettes party
with kegs, blunts, galore
i got a little tipsy
a little high, a little more
 
first came her lil cousin
about 10 years old
on a mission to find
a lucky lady for him to hold
 
then came the booze
with a stash of weed
i couldn't help myself
it was a necessity, a desired need
 
Sari you kissed me
Well your my girlfriend babe
i wasn't lesbian at the moment
i think she wanted to get laid
 
i had to hide my drunkness
around the other friends of mine
for if they saw how fucked up i was
i would be ""way out of line""
 
then we ditched that shit
to move on for another act
the koolaid was spiked!
you couldnt believe how id react
 
i was laughing along
and saw this girl Gina from way back
i was trying to listen to her
but i was so drunk that listening was a lack
 
then we played bullshit
if i could only see the cards straight
i wonder who ever won
i bullshitted an Ace for an Eight
 
Then it was time for Kevin to bring us back
In the car we were gunna have fun
It's ok i know him sort of
So ofcourse i called SHOT GUN!
 
Alex, Andres, Danielle
Kevin, Jeremy, Tyler, and Jill
I couldn't help myself from calling them
They are the bestest ever still
 
a W can be made with
fingers of three
STOP SIGN i yelled
practicing for calling mom as they could see
 
Kevin wanted to throw me out of the car
So I zipped and locked the key
I threw it away
But the key kept on unlocking me
 
Then we went back to Kristyns
i called my mommie
kristyn said i did very well
expecially with my 10 hickies !
 
so that was my saturday night
i was so lucky with no hang over
wish me luck hiding my hickies
see you next sleepover !"

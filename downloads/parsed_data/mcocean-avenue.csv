Now that I think back on it, an extra ten bucks is a kind of shitty trade-off for getting drunk with all of my favorite people. But oh well, I wouldn't have been able to get a fake ID by tomorrow anyway. Being seventeen sucks. And I have three more months of it. Haha.

I only have work for less than three weeks - I move into my dorm August 23rd. I'm excited, but it's now just hitting me. I will only be seeing my parents once in a great while. I'll only be seeing my best friends once in a great while, unless they decide to come visit, which probably won't be too often since MSU is not a stone's throw away, and they'll be busy with their own lives. It'll be awesome to make new friends, but yet it's not the same as having your best friends always there for you. It will be hard to find someone who understands me as good as them. They understand me and deal with all of my shit, patiently, because they know me. These new friends won't. I don't know. It's weird.

I just hope I don't forget anything, haaa."

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Memorial Day Weekend + pictures"">This weekend was a lot of fun.&nbsp;<br /><br />Friday, I had to go up to Sarnia to play in a tournament with Little Caesars, to get practice for Lake Placid. It was fun, I guess. I played forward for all 3 games. We played 3 games in less than 24 hours - cool, right. I hate Canada. Seriously. It's so stupid, I don't even know how&nbsp;to explain it...it's just not the same as home.&nbsp;I came back Saturday afternoon cause I had to work 6-11 at Big Bear...I love my job. Seriously. I worked with Erin, again. I've worked with her every single&nbsp;time I've worked. It's amazing cause she is one of my bestest friends. They let me off early so I went to Jason Siadeck's party...it was all right, I saw a few people I've missed - like ALLAN, Jen Lilly, Josh Wood, and the guys that went to the Dominican...we (me, Chelcy, Rahn, Coto, and Zack) left and ended up going on some miscellaneous adventures in the Astro Van...ohhh, the Astro Van. What a vehicle. Okay so Sunday night. GIRL'S NIGHT - me, Erica, Andrea, and Genevie. So. Fun. I missed those girls SO much. We got a half gallon of Five for ten bucks, drove out to Greektown and had dinner, then went to Casey's with a bunch of people and it was nice. I drank just enough to get buzzed, I didn't overdo it, and it felt amazing. I haven't not overdone it in so long. I'm glad I was in control. Monday night, Erica and I killed off some more of the half gallon...after I worked 5-10...THEY MADE ME STAY 2 HOURS AFTER WE&nbsp;CLOSED. It was INSANE. They only had 3 waitresses, and me for the night. No bussers. I seriously bussed almost every table in the restaurant - I had to if I wanted to have anywhere to seat people, because the waitresses were swamped with customers. So I'd run to the front, tell the people I'd be right with them, sprint to bus the table and wipe it off, sprint back to the front, grab the people, and seat them, then do the same thing all over again. I was sweating and shit. The waitresses were so appreciative though, they forced me to take money...like I tried running away from them but they grabbed me and stuffed dollar bills down the back of my shirt. And they paid for the food I ordered for the end of my shift. Amazing, I love everyone at Big Bear. Then I went and got Andi and Erica and we went to Bruce's friend's party in Southgate...another fun night. I love my girlfriends. Finally, today was our Senior Skip Day, and Jordan had a barbeque...I could only stay for a little and I couldn't drink cause I had soccer practice, but everyone else was TANKED. So funny. Love my friends. When I was there, it was me, Kat, CT, Brit, Drod, Amz, Lauren, CB, Laura, Ogs, JD, R, Jwills, Cervo, Brad, Leo, Vella, Clark, Scotty, Kyle, Rob, Dan, Kels, anddd Fuzz. This summer is going to be absolutely insane, I'll tell you that much.<br /><br />AH THIS FRIDAY. I'm so excited. A bunch of girls are getting dressed up, going out to Mexicantown and having dinner, then coming back and partying our asses off. I know I'm driving me, Gen, Erica, Andi, and Cathryn. So it's going to be a whole bunch of Riverview girls, plus me and Gen, and possibly some Huron girls. It's mine and Gen's last day of school. Crazy stuff.<br /><br />Okay pictures to follow in a later entry. I don't feel like doing them right now.<br /></div>"

"event","It's still hard to grasp that my senior year is almost over; and in August I'll be heading out to East Lansing to live on my own and finally become an adult. Today was our senior breakfast, and I cried a little bit. Especially when our class sponsor went up and told everyone how we had helped him just as much as he had helped us grow, character-wise. I love Mr. Salgat, I've known him my entire life. He used to coach me in Little Leagues and he's still so proud of me for that, he is the absolute nicest man alive, and it makes me sad knowing that I won't get to see him every day anymore. Now it puts tears in my eyes when I listen to ""My Wish"" by Rascal Flatts when our class president told us that's exactly what she wanted to say to us before we were all split up forever. I'm such a dork. I LOVE high school. It's such a comfort zone. I like seeing the people I love on a regular basis and going to dances and playing soccer with the same team for years at a time. I'm going to miss everybody so much, because everything is going to change. The future freaks me out.

Friday, Meghan, Chelcy, and I went to Zack Frescarelli's house and drank...we played drinking games with Rahn, Zack King, this kid Ricky, and Josh's brother Rob...it was good times. I had my first day of work...on a Saturday night at a restaurant that does very good business...it was insane. If I was the kind of person to get stressed very easily I would have died. Luckily, Erin's like, the hostess boss and she's one of my best friends so she had my back. Yesterday, Meghan and I couldn't find anything to do so we made up for all the sleep we missed Friday.

I went with Brant, he was the perfect date. I loved my dress and hair and makeup. I loved how EVERYBODY went to Prom. People who never go to dances were there, which is the whole point I guess. I loved how after our class song played we did our 06 huddle. I loved how every girl there looked absolutely gorgeous. I'm seriously depressed it was our last dance EVER, though. I'll never get to be all dolled up like that again. After the dance, I went up to Katrina's cottage in Irish Hills with some people. Team Plastic Cup faced off against Team Cuzzi, and we were dominating that shit for a while. It was so much fun. Friday night, me and Meghan hung out and got drunk at Nick's with Tina, Mike Denny, and Guzman, we played Kings, it was pretty fun. Saturday, we did absolutely NOTHING. We met up with Rahn, Zack, and Ricky, but that was it and we didn't do anything. I can't remember the last night I haven't done anything. 'Twas weird. Today, I had a job interview at Big Bear Lodge, and I got the job as a hostess. My best friend Erin Mercer gets to train me. It's amazing. Senior year has been absolutely amazing. I'm not excited to graduate at all. I'm going to miss it. Yes, I love highschool."

I pretty much lived at Sarah's all weekend and it was...well, insane. Sarah Behm, I love you. The show last night was amazing, and so much fun. Thanks to everyone who made it that way.

I've been lifting at the Y every other day lately, and lifting in the basement with my dad when I don't go there. I' I'm really serious about losing weight and toning down. I can already see the difference on the ice, and hopefully I'll start to see a change in the way I look too. 

I can't wait for Homecoming. I have: my dress. My hair appt. (which is already paid for at VIP because I have a gift certificate.) A date. (Andy freaking Kaliszewski.) The day off from hockey. (Coach is letting me skip.) Places for pictures and dinner. (I'm not sure where we're going to end up but I've talked to a few people and it's not like we won't have anywhere to go.) All I need to get is jewelry and new makeup. And I still have 3 weeks left.

Er, I really want to be on Court. I don't think I will be, but at least I know I have people that would vote for me. Like my best friend John. I guess him and his friends were talking about at lunch how I'm a genuinely nice person and I'm not fake. That just made me feel good, because lately all I've been hearing is how much I've changed and how annoying I am now. Oh well, just vote for me<333.

Oh yes, I meant to say something about that. Yes, I realize I can be really loud and annoying these days. It's just that, that's how my best friends and I act towards each other, and I'm with them a large portion of my time. So when I'm not with them, I kind of forget I shouldn't act as stupidly as I do when I'm with them, and kind of freak people out. So don't worry, I'll be toning it down. I'll even tone it down when I am with them. I think that'd be best, haha. I'll stop screaming at people in the hallways how in love with them I am. I'm getting way too loud for my own good. This is bad.

Monday night, Erica and I hung out. We went to the mall to get clothes for her senior pictures, then got food, and went to JT's house to say goodbye to him before he left. I'm going to miss him so much. I never really got to hangout with him that often, but he is an amazing person and I'm pretty much in love with him. Saying goodbye was hard.

Yesterday, Sarah and I hung out with Jon Matle all day. Jon and I watched Arrested Development at his house, then went and got Sarah and went to the mall, and ate at Olga's (well, Sarah and I watched Jon eat) and had amazing conversations about sex haha.) Then we went and hung out at Sarah's and ate Dora the Explorer teddy grahams. And watered Sarah's flowers. It was amazing. And when we had to leave Jon it was so sad, I am in love with Jon Matle. Because he is fatal.

And today - first day of school. My schedule is Broadcasting, Production Hour, AP English, Yearbook 2, Government, and Pre-Calc. There's some cool people in my classes, I suppose. I saw Sarah like 325286 times today. And all of the sophomore boys are like gorgeous, I swear. I don't know where they've been hiding all of my life.

<P>Why am I so SAD these days? I'm like, seriously depressed. And it's ridiculous. I couldn't fall asleep last night, so I was looking through all of my old CDs...and I found Goo Goo Dolls-Dizzy Up The Girl, and that CD is depressing. Acoustic #3 - I was laying in my bed listening to it crying. AH I seriously have no clue what my problem is. I think part of the problem is my family. I feel like they're kind of, I don't know, bonding against me or something. Yeah I'm paranoid, fuck off. My mom has just not been letting me do things for no reason at all, and tonight - LAST NIGHT OF SUMMER - she made me come home at 10:30. And then when I got home she was a total bitch to me and almost made me cry. It's like daily routine now, even though I'm the only person in the family that will clean the entire house without asking, do everything she tells me to do even if I don't want to do it...blah blah blah. I guess she's just stressed out, because my hockey team costs so much money and she has to pay for my brother to go to college and everything...but I just wish she wouldn't take her stress out on me.</P>
<P>And if you are my friend and I've taken my stress out on you lately...I'm sorry. I have no right to do that, it's just...I don't know. People keep asking me about college, and I haven't even started applying or anything like that, and they're like AH WHAT ARE YOU THINKING YOU'RE GOING TO DIEEE IF YOU DON'T APPLY NOW YOU STUPID IDIOT! And my parents are pressuring me to play hockey in college and I DON'T WANT TO...And I feel like half of my friends don't give a shit about me, and all of my friends are leaving for college and so is Lewis and I'm very upset about that. And school starts on Wednesday and I'm going to be fucking overwhelmed and AH I DON'T FUCKING KNOW. </P>
<P>And I probably won't have a date to homecoming. But pshh that's natural, Michelle have a date to homecoming? Not in a million years. Fuck, I'm getting my hair cut at V.I.P. Wednesday, and I'm going fucking short in the layer department. I'll probably regret it but who cares.</P>"

<P>UGH people need to stop acting like they know why I'm not friends with certain people or why I don't hangout with those people anymore...I have my reasons. You probably wouldn't understand them...They make sense to me, however. And I don't know you might not agree with my reasons...In fact they could be totally fucking ridiculous. But I don't care, I'm happy with my life right now. The people I hangout with now are AMAZING. Like the other night, Sarah Macie Ashley and I went up to the clock tower in Wyandotte and just hungout there and did nothing...and it was sooo much fun. I changed a lot this summer. I changed, in that I don't put up with people's bullshit anymore. I used to let people walk all over me and be a complete jerk to me and me just take it, and I'm through with that. I have enough bullshit in my life, I don't need more. </P>
<P>The people I've met and hungout with this summer and become close with; treat me AMAZING and I love them all so much. They're all so nice and just...I love them. I mean like, when I was really sick and had to stay home, Erica and Genevie came over and brought me a Slurpee and visited me and shit. None of my other friends have ever done anything like that. I love that about Erica and Gen. They're so generous, and truly genuinely kind people. They just do random amazing things that make me soo happy. I'm so glad I've gotten so close with them this summer. And Sarah. I fucking love her. She's probably one of the only people in the world I can stand and she's just amazing. We can hangout for 32586 days straight and not get sick of eachother (we've done it before too, haha.) And we just understand each other. Ah and Macie and Tara and Ashley and Alanna...I know they're all like, a year-two years younger than me, but I don't give a shit because they're AMAZING. We're all like, inlove with eachother I love it. </P>
<P>I guess what I'm trying to say is this summer was amazing. And I'd like to thank each and every one of you who helped make it that way. Even if we only hungout like, once. I don't care. I love you all. If you're a new friend I just met this summer, then you should know I'm probably in love with you because every person I met this summer is amazing. Like Ryan, and Corey and just everybody. </P>
<P>Fuck, I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore.<BR>I NEED A DATE TO HOMECOMING SOMEBODY GO WITH ME.</P>"

"event","My mother has this penchant for not letting me go out random nights for absolutely NO reason. It's fucking ridiculous, because she usually does this after earlier giving me permission to go out. Then she forces me to screw over my friends, and I don't even have a good reason for my friends why I can't go out with them. My mom is insane. Sarah, Macie, Sean Tarolli, and I were going to go to the Quit Your Life show, and go see Corey and Frankie and whoever the hell else we decided we wanted to see. It was going to be a damn good night. But now, for no absolute fucking reason whatsoever, I'm sitting at my computer typing this completely pointless entry while everyone else is enjoying their last week of summer. FUCK YOU, PAT. Seriously. You're ruining my life.

Two of my best friends are gone. Erica's up north; Noah's in fucking New York. Me, him, and Sarah hung out earlier today before my mom decided to flip a freakin' nut. So I guess that's good. I miss them though. I MISS EVERYONE."

<P>Ashley's cute.</P>
<P>Well, the past few days have been basically amazing.</P>
<P>Saturday, I went to Tara's with Erica and it was a lot of fun. Jeff; Eric; Ron; Alanna; Becca; Sarah; Noah; Macie; Ashley; Chelsea; Sean; Jordan; and Nick were there a long with others I think...and Lewis and his two friends came over for a bit, it was good times for sure.</P>
<P>Sunday, Lewis and I went to the November Sky/Ettison Clio/The Myriad/The Beautiful Mistake show at the Modern Exchange. It was one of the funnest (I know that's not a word but whatever) shows I've been to in a really long time. Definitely one of the highlights of my summer. Lewis and I went to Taco Bell, then to the show, and we pull up and all my favorite people are gathered in the lot. Erica, Gen, Ron, Sean, Macie, Alanna, Ashley, Sarah, Tara, Eric, Dan, Phil...and so many others, it was great&amp;hearts;. They're the people I've been seeing this whole summer, and who I wouldn't mind seeing every day for the rest of my life. Ian Stephens, Jon Matle, Mike Jurysta were up there too; it was great, I missed them. The bands were amazing; Gen and I told The Beautiful Mistake to play Wide Eyes; and at first he didn't really say anything, but then in the middle of their show he points at us and goes, ""Meet me at my van after the show and I'll play you guys an acoustic version."" Amazing. We went out there to his van...we just sat and listened, it was beautiful. His band and the guys in The Myriad were so down-to-earth and friendly, it was awesome. Josh sent me a message on Myspace telling me that me, Gen, Erica, and Lewis ""made his night."" =) Ah good times. Genevie and I fell in love again...seriously when me and that girl hang out it's always so fucking fun. I'm inlove with her. My dad gave me a 1 am curfew and let me stay the night at Macie's with Sarah and Tara, yes I'm inlove with them.</P>
<P>Monday, Erica and I hung out all day pretty much. She got me at like 5:45, we hung out until basically midnight. We did absolutely nothing but it was still fun because I was with one of my bestfriends in the world. We did stall out and Lewis and Justin had to rescue us haha, and we spent like 259266 dollars on food, and stopped at Nick's, and then picked up Sarah and Noah and hungout with them the rest of the night. </P>
<P>Yesterday, me, Sarah, and Macie hung out, Tara hungout with us a little. We got icecream and went to Wyandotte and Erica met us up there and got runover by the Astro Van and it was amazing, I'm in love with my friends&amp;hearts;. And I met this kid, we are friends on Myspace haha. MYSPACE...A place for friends =).</P>
<P>Welp, that's pretty much all I've done. I get to hangout with Gen sometime this week, and me and Sarah are going to the show together on Saturday. Sorry for the really long pointless details about my daily doings...I just didn't want to forget about this week.</P>"

If you don't know him, and you probably don't, he played at Ohio State and he was so good he left early to play for the Vancouver Canucks in the NHL. We went 1 on 1 a few times...I'm not gonna lie, he fucking burned me. And he wasn't even trying. He'd like, flick a wrist, and the puck would sail all the way down the ice and hit the middle of the back of the net. Fucking sick, dude. He's amazing. And yeah...Erica and I hung out after, I DIDN'T SHOWER haha I SMELLED, FUCKERS &hearts;...we hung out at Macie's with Sarah and Tara and Ashley for a few and then went to Lewis'. Good times. Love them all &hearts;. Today was registration. Worked the yearbook table with Cindy Kallas filling out reciepts. Saw some gorgeous lovers I'd been missing. Love you all. Okay I'm done goodbye.

We did pretty much absolutely nothing, but it was fun. We went to my house; left and went to Smoothie King &amp; then Ron's, and then we all went to Macie's later.

Then we met Eric, Ramone, Phil, and Dan up at 7-11...
Went to this kid Jon's with Eric and Ramone in my Astro Van.
Dropped them off at Eric's and went back to my house for a bit...
Then we met Lewis up at the bowling alley.
Saw Chad, Nick, and Tony, which was exciting.
I love Lewis. He's amazing.
Erica and I then went to Justin's with Lewis and watched a mooovie.
After that, Erica and I basically had to keep ourselves occupied for a whole night,
Until gay Eric called us...we went to his house.
Uhhh yeah I don't really want to talk about what happened after that haha...
I just fucking love Erica Gubbini and if I lost her as a friend I'd die.
Seriously. She's one of my best friends, in the world.
And now people think I'm a bad person...
I wish I could change what people thought.

Anyway, I'm going to Wisconsin at 5 am tomorrow, I'll be back laaate Sunday...
So leave some love for me while I'm gone.
And let me know if you want to hang out when I get back."

BECAUSE I'VE AVOIDED DOING ANYTHING EXTREMELY STUPID AND EMBARRASSING!
That I would regret later. So, I'd like to say thank you, Disease,
For ravaging my body and rendering me weak, thus forcing me into my bed,
Where I would stay and do no harm to my reputation.

I feel like I don't fit in, anywhere."

"event","Last night, I was forced to sit on my ass and watch CSI twice. 
Sarah called me and I called her back later but she didn't answer.
My doorbell rang and it was Erica and Genevie, bearing gifts of a Slurpee and a newly burned Underoath CD.
They colored on my Dry-Erase board and we went to my room.
Then they left, and I did absolutely nothing.
Noah & I talked on the phone for a while, then I got tired, so we parted ways.
Then I slept, and then Gen called me this morning =).

I seriously don't understand how people can stay home for more than one night at a time.
I'm seriously going insane.
I never write entries like this."

I'm not sure though.
But I have to stay home and rest all weekend,
Till I find out Monday.
It's pretty ridiculous.
I want to rip my hair out and scream of boredom.
I love how this happens,
On a weekend when there's so much going on.
Please stop by and visit me...
Or just call me.
Cell: 925-9222 Home: 671-2017.

Listening to Cross My Heart by the Rocket Summer over & over.

"event","I don't even know where to start...All I know, is people are getting mad at me because I hang out with a greater variety of people these days. Everyone keeps telling me I've changed. And getting pissed off because I accept people's apologies, no matter how they've treated me...it's how I was raised, it's how God wants me to live...should I hate people forever, even though I bear no hard feelings toward them, just to keep my other friends happy? I know people have been upset because there was a few day period where I ditched people a few times...I feel so shitty about that, my problem is I love hanging out with people and I try to make too many plans at once then they all end up falling apart and I don't have the backbone to call people and cancel plans I made with them after I'd already made plans with someone else. And sometimes, this may be hard to believe, but I forget to call people sometimes. Yes, it's true. I don't know, I'm kind of starting to ramble in a completely incoherent fashion, but I'm getting really upset. Upset about the fact people are getting pissed at me because I have friends. I'm sorry I like to hang out with different people and not hang out with the same person every single night of my life...I love meeting new people, and hanging out with them...and my ""new"" friends are the ones that actually call me and ask me to hang out, what am I supposed to do, say no for no apparent reason?

And another thing that's been bothering me...the fact that there's been a Myspace made about me, and one about Joelson...it's obviously someone that knows us, and knows us pretty well at that...it has to be someone that's hung out with either me or him before, or both of us...the one about me basically said over and over that I was a slut, and I was ugly, and all of this stuff...and the one about Joelson emphasizes that he cuts himself (which is completely NOT TRUE)...and shit like that, so if you know who made them, please let me know, so I can promptly end my friendship with them and get on with my life, because I'm pretty positive it's a friend (or friends) of mine. Thanks."

There's coaches from University of Vermont, Bemidji State University, University of Wisconsin, and the University of Minnesota-Duluth.

<P><lj-cut text=""Mm-hmm.""> </P>
<P>I'm starting to get really stressed out. Senior year is going to be insane. I try to do way too much, and it makes me crazy. I signed up for quite a few hard classes next year, like AP English, AP Govt, more than likely AP Spanish, Pre-Calc (after taking a year off from math, bad, bad, bad mistake, I don't like talking about that. Ha)...and Megan &amp; I are editors of the yearbook next year, so that will probably be some hard work. Then playing AAA hockey again. </P>
<P>You don't understand how much hockey consumes my life. I love it more than anything in the world. It's my absolute favorite thing to do. But there is such a thing, as too much of a good thing...that's how I feel with hockey. Like, last year, for Little Caesars 16U, we had practice about four days a week, and a bunch of showcases where we went to places like Illinois and Wisconsin, and tournaments and whatnot...and they were all during school dances and festivities. I didn't get to go to one school dance at Woodhaven except for Sadie's, and it was extremely lame. So like...next year, I don't know if I'm going to have to choose hockey over my senior year homecoming, or senior year Snoball...fuck man.</P>
<P>And my dad's not helping. Apparently, he's been talking to all of my journalism and English teachers behind my back, asking them to find out if the schools that have Division 1 &amp; 3 hockey have journalism programs, if the programs are good, etc. He is pressuring me to the point of insanity to play hockey in college. I know it's because he doesn't want to pay for college. My mom told me that most of his paycheck has been going into his retirement fund and barely any has been going into college funds for my brother &amp; I. And like...it's not like I can't get scholarships. I have a 3.9 GPA and I'm ranked 10th in my class. I could probably get a bunch of academic scholarships if I tried and looked around for them. It's stressing me out so much. Because I don't want to play hockey in college. The committment is unbelievable. They practice every day of the week. They have to lift weights, practice for hours, then go lift more weights. They're gone all weekend about 3 times a month, and have to miss class on Fridays and Mondays sometimes. I don't think I could do that and keep my grades up in college. It would kill me. </P>
<P>But my dad is making me feel so guilty. Him and my mom's thing is, ""Why are we still paying for your hockey then, if you don't even want to play in college?"" JQUIEJWIEOTJEIROYJTOY487389758U4Y JHHH omg. They don't fucking understand. Colleges don't want me to play for them. I'm good enough to play AAA but that's about it. I don't have the skill to play D1. I could probably play D3, but here's the thing. I want to go into Journalism more than anything in the world. The job outlook for Journalism SUCKS. There are barely any jobs in that field. It's really hard to get into. So I would want a journalism degree from a university that's really good with journalism, that would have prestige, and make a future employer look at it and go ""hm, she's from so-and-so school, they have a great journalism reputation."" I don't want to go to some D3 college with a shitty as fuck journalism program, just because my dad doesn't want to pay for my college. Plus, there's nowhere to go after college for women. The Olympic team. That's it. I would never make the Olympic team in 3 million and a half years. </P>
<P>FUCK MY DAD KINDA SUCKS SOME TIMES. Everyone's like, He's only trying to help.<BR>Well, I know what I want to do with my life. He just doesn't care.<BR>I want to go to Michigan State to major in journalism.<BR>End of story.</P>
<P>GOD, I HAVE A FUCKING SPANISH PROJECT DUE TUESDAY. I HAVEN'T STARTED IT YET. MOTHERFUCKER.</P>"

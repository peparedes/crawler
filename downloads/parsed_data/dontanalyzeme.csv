"event","well my life has certainly changed since i last updated so long ago. i am in a relationship with someone who makes me happier than i thought i could ever be. i graduated college and will be going to graduate school in the fall. i am still having troubles accepting myself, but i did manage to come out to my parents. they already knew, of course. they say they are okay with everything, but i dont believe them. they are not okay, and they are doing a poor job of hiding it. it is a tumultuous situation, but soon enough i will be moving out for good, and their opinions wont matter anymore. i am waiting and waiting for that day."

"event","this weekend was the missions conference at church. i like church, but i dont like being there for such extended periods of time. i dont like the attitudes of so many of the people there. even this weekend, the theme was prayer for the persecuted church around the world. all they were essentially asking for was prayers for christian around the world who are not free to practice their religion, thats fine with me, but i wish they could have sent that message without a biggoted view toward islam. i am in an islam class right now for a school requirement, and i have learned to overcome any prejudices i had and to look at it as a legitemate belief system. the speaker this weekend kept saying ""islam is not a religion of peace"", but it is. i wish people would not be so closed-minded.


ive been having a lot of self-hatred issues as well lately; im not sure why. i dont like that every time i go to church i feel like if they knew what i was, they would all judge me. i dont like that yesterday, when my pastor asked one of my friends if he could talk to her and she came back looking a little upset, the first thought that i had was that he must have asked her if i was gay, and she had told him the truth. it had nothing to do with that at all, but i wish there was some way i could free myself of the constant fear that someone will find out. if any of them knew that i spent the night in my girlfriend's bed instead of my own, they would be horrified.


sometimes i disgust myself, and i dont know why. i know theres nothing i can do to change myself, and that i need to be okay with who i am, but sometimes i just feel like its <I>not</i> okay for me to be this way."

"event","sometimes (like right now) i just want to <i>not</i> be around people. but then i get lonely. i have almost everything i could possibly want from this life right now. why do i sometimes get unhappy like this for no apparant reason? i need to let go of my troubles (paul says in phillipians: do not be anxious about anything), but recently they have been making me feel very overwhelmed. i hate that i want to be with people but avoid them right now. i guess i just want to be near someone but not have to talk to them. i did that in katie and beccas room tonight, and it was nice, but then i wanted to leave, so i did, and now im in my room and i cant stand the loneliness. im nervous about having a single next year on fourth floor.

"event","I FEEL SO LIBERATED. i was talking to dr bennett today during my academic advising appointment, and i mentioned how my parents are questioning my choice to go to graduate school and then to do postdoc research and stuff. i then got into how because they never went to college that they cant really give me advice on that sort of thing. theyve never been in this situation and theyve never had to make this choice, so they arent really capable of imagining the pressures and benefits and downfalls of my choices here at school. then i mentioned that i feel like i cant live up to <i>any</I> of their expectations, such as getting married and settling down and having kids and stuff. then he said that i wasnt the only student that he has ever seen in this situation, and i was like ""now, are you really clear on what my situation is?"" and he was like ""i can read between the lines..."" and then we started talking about stereotypes that affect groups that are lumped together because of their sexuality or other characteristics. he said that if i ever needed a supportive adult to talk to, that i could come to him. i told him that my mom had once asked if i was gay, and he said that asking means that she wants to know, and that she probably already does know. i wanted to cry because it felt so good to be honest, and to even think about the possibility of being honest with my parents. i feel really satisfied and justified, and it was so good to talk openly with one of my role models that is sort of like a parent but more like a friend. im even on the verge of tears right now, i just feel so much more secure about myself, and really validated. its the best feeling in the world.

"event","last night i had a scary dream. i was living in a flat with this girl named courtney, who was in my PE class last semester, and this semester is in my physics class, and someone else who i couldnt think of. it was sort of a scary atmosphere, i felt like it was a time of political turnover and uncertainty, like we were living there because we were sort of imprisoned, but not really. then i mentioned to courtney that i was from seattle, and she looked at me with disgust, and said that there were lots of gay people in seattle. i told her i was gay, and she threatened to turn me in, i guess to the authorities. my sunday school teacher was there, and i ran away. it was really scary.


this is the second dream ive had like this in the last month or so. the last time i dreamt that a bunch of my friends and i had been forced to go to this reparative therapy camp, and my pastor showed up. i hid from him, but i was so afraid he would find out.


i dont know how to make these nightmares go away. today in sunday school we were talking about sharing the gospel, and one of the adults in the class asked how to share the gospel with highly disturbed people. my pastor asked what he meant, and he said that he knew one person at his work who was having a sex change, and another person who was ""in a sinful relationship."" then my pastor said ""well, as a person who has a masters degree in family therapy, im going to say that youre right, those are some very disturbed individuals."" then he went on to answer the question, basically saying to lead by example and make sure they know that God loves them but not their sin.


then there was a guest preacher today, and he spoke about spiritual warfare, and how to arm oneself with the tools God gives to fight the devil. it was really scary, because he said that everyone has their own ladder on which they can easily descend into the flaming river of hell. he talked about willful purity and willful sin, and said that true repentance is the only way to avoid satans grasp.


this is the kind of stuff that really makes me question my faith. not that i dont believe in God, because i dont think anything will ever change that, but it sometimes makes me wonder whether im going to go to heaven or hell when i die. i love God and i love Jesus, and i know im a sinner, but i just feel so excluded from the church that i cant help but wonder if im excluded from God's kingdom too. i dont want to be...


i know that some churches dont condemn homosexuality and some do. i honestly dont feel like this is something i should have to be dealing with. both things are part of me. i truly believe that sexuality is inherent, and cannot be changed or chosen. i also am a Christian, and that cant be changed either. why do the two most important facets of my life have to seem so at odds with one another?"

"event","my first valentines day alone in... i cant even count how many years. its pretty weird, but almost liberating. its good to know that i can make it on my own and be okay with myself. i have friends that love me, and thats good enough for now. though of course... as always... <lj-cut text=""theres this girl..."">theres this girl... im into her and she says shes into me. but she has a boyfriend. *sigh* shes sweet and cute and funny and intelligent. i positively adore her. i get all silly when i think or talk about her, and all nervous (in a good way) when i talk to her. however, if she is happy in her current relationship then that is all i can ask for. unlike with becca (who i think was more of an obsession than an actual attraction), i am satisfied as long as she is happy. its weird, because ive never felt that way before. im usually jealous of the significant other, but in this case if she is happier with him than with me, then that is just fine.</lj-cut>


unfortunately, i have been having some issues at church. i just finished reading a wonderful book called ""love, ellen"" about ellen degeneres' coming out, both public and private. i normally dont get all ooey-gooey over books, but perhaps because it hit so close to home, or maybe just because i knew it was a real story about a real person, i got quite emotional. i felt like i really got to know ellen and betty, and i guess i got personally attached. in any case, i was at a function for the church youth/college-aged people at my pastor's house and we played several games, including taboo. one of the cards that came up for my pastor's daughter was ""ellen degeneres"". of course, being in seventh grade, she had no idea who ellen is, so she skipped over it without further thought. my pastor, however, was counting the cards to determine the points for that round, reading the words allowed. when he got to the card with ellen on it, he pronounced her name ""ellen degenerate"". i almost cried right there. it really hurt. of course, i am not out to the people at my church. i would love to be, though. i wish i had some assurance that i wouldnt be excommunicated or something. they constantly remind the congregation to pray for national leaders (which i wholeheartedly agree with), but then they sometimes say stuff like ""especially those trying to re-define marriage"", which just pisses me off.


then monday night i was at church choir practice, and i mentioned something about leaving the area after i graduate from college next year and going off to medical or graduate school. the ladies instantly made a comment suggesting that they would like me to find a husband and settle down in the area. i was insulted not only because they assumed i would find a husband, but that i should not pursue my academic and career goals in favor of becoming a stay-at-home wife and mother. i said ""no, i dont think that is going to happen."" on the way home, the lady who drives me to and from rehersal made a similar comment, saying that if i were to find a husband soon, i would perhaps stay in the area. i know it was their way of saying that they like me, and want me to stick around, but the problem with these people is that they can never just say what they feel without making sure it fits into the societal construction they force themselves to fit into. i dont want to come out to them in a rash, heat-of-the-moment declaration. i dont even know if i can ever come out to them. i know that the PCA stance on homosexuality is that it is a sin, and i know that they subscribe to the ""focus on the family"" bulliten insert, which has sponsored some of those awful gay ""treatment"" camps. however, i dont know if they would allow me to keep coming to the church. i dont know if i would be socially rejected even if i was permitted to keep attending.


i have begun to read books on homosexuality and the bible. not only have i read pro-tolerance books, but also the anti-gay ones as well. it is good to be familiar with the opposing argument, i suppose. in any case, it all seems to come down to the question of whether or not someone believes that homosexuality is a choice. those that perceive it as a choice tend to condemn it, those who perceive it as an internal characteristic, whether learned or genetic or both, tend to accept it. either way, it is very scary to be part of a faith that has members that believe i am going to hell just because i love other women.


i could never give up my religion. i could never give up my love for God and Jesus Christ, or the things that Christianity has taught me. unfortunately, i am afraid that some people have chosen to forget that Jesus said that the greatest commandment of all is to love your neighbor as yourself."

<lj-cut text=""no more discrimination in washington state"">
<font size=6>Gay rights bill to become Washington law
</font>
05:16 PM PST on Friday, January 27, 2006

Associated Press

OLYMPIA, Wash. - Lawmakers passed a gay civil rights measure on Friday, a major victory for gay rights activists who have watched the measure fail in the Legislature for nearly 30 years.

The bill passed the Senate on a 25-23 vote, with a lone Republican joining majority Democrats. The House quickly concurred, and Gov. Chris Gregoire said she planned to sign the bill into law Tuesday.

Cheers erupted from the Senate's balconies, which were packed with onlookers expecting the bill to clear its perennial roadblock.

Hundreds of people rallied on the Capitol steps in Olympia on Monday in support of a statewide gay civil-rights bill. It was part of daylong lobbying and prayers for House Bill 2661.

Rep. Ed Murray, a Seattle Democrat who has sponsored the bill for 11 years, was given a standing ovation in the House after the measure gained final approval.

""I know for some, you're not happy,"" said Murray, one of four openly gay lawmakers in the Legislature. ""For others, it's a historic day that quite honestly we wouldn't imagine could have happened even a few short years ago. It's a new dawn, it's a new day.""

The measure adds ""sexual orientation"" to a state law that bans discrimination in housing, employment and insurance, making Washington the 17th state passing such laws covering gays and lesbians, and the seventh to protect transgender people.

Sen. Bill Finkbeiner, R-Kirkland, was the sole Senate Republican to endorse the measure, a year after it lost by just one vote in the Senate. Two Senate Democrats voted against the measure. One Republican was not present.

""We don't choose who we love. The heart chooses who we will l! ove. And I don't believe that it is right for us to say ... that it's acceptable to discriminate against people because of that,"" Finkbeiner said in a floor speech.

Sen. Dan Swecker, R-Rochester, said the measure would ""trample unrelentingly"" on religious viewpoints that object to gays.

""We, the state, are telling people to accept, actually to embrace, something that goes against their religious views,"" he said.

The measure passed the House last week on a 60-37 vote, with six Republicans joining 54 Democrats in support.

Republicans amended the bill on the House floor to say that it would not modify or change state marriage laws.

The state Supreme Court heard arguments on a case challenging Washington's ban on gay marriage last year, and a ruling is expected in the coming weeks.

A Senate amendment this week added a caveat saying the state doesn't endorse ""any specific belief, practice, behavior, or orientation.""

""We have truly made history,"" Gregoire said in a news conference following the vote.

Gregoire told Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., the news by cell phone, holding the phone away from her ear as she said they cheer! ed. Cantwell and Clinton were in Seattle for a fundraiser Friday.

The measure was first introduced in 1977, but it is most closely associated with the state's first openly gay lawmaker, Democrat Cal Anderson of Seattle, who sponsored it for eight years before he died of AIDS in 1995.

""I don't doubt that he's really smiling down on us right now,"" said his partner of 10 years, Eric Ishina of Seattle. ""He gave a lot of us the enthusiasm and energy to keep fighting for this bill.""

The fight for the bill in essence came to an end this month, when Finkbeiner announced he would switch his vote, and the momentum of support continued outside of Olympia.

Earlier this month, several companies, including Microsoft Corp., Boeing Co., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Nike Inc. signed a letter urging passage of the measure, which would add ""sexual orientation"" to a state law that already bans discrimination in housing, employment and insurance based on race, gend! er, age, disability, religion, marital status and other facto! rs.

Microsoft's pitch for the bill comes a year after it was denounced for quietly dropping its support.

The bill has sparked significant debate across the state, and two public hearings drew dozens of people who opposed the measure on moral grounds.

""What you're going to have to have now is the promoting of homosexual sex as normal via the apparatus of government,"" said Dr. Joseph B. Fuiten of the Faith & Freedom Network.

Fuiten said his organization was preparing to file for a referendum on the bill, but added that he may wait on the Supreme Court's ruling on gay marriage.

Gregoire said she would fight any effort to undo the law.

""I will fight any initiative, any referendum that tries to take back the equality these folks and others around our great state have been given today,"" she said.

The law will take effect in June, 90 days after the end of session, unless a referendum challenge is filed, freezing it.

Celebrations were planned in nine cities Friday night, including Seattle, Bellingham, Spokane and Yakima.

in other news, my love life is as stagnant as ever. i guess i cant complain since i got to spend the whole day with a girl i have been in love with for almost exactly a year now at a mutual friends birthday party (which unfortnuately took place amongst her bigotted relatives). i know she has a girlfriend and they are very serious, but part of me still gets my hopes up every time she is near me. she kept saying things like ""i heart you"" and ""i love you"" and ""youre so cute"" etc all day. it makes me feel miserable knowing that when she puts her arm around me while posing for a picture, she means nothing more than platonic fun, whereas i practically melt on the spot and want to tell her that if shell have me, im hers.


i guess maybe it is a good thing i have no love life because now i am able to focus on school more, which i really need this semester if any of my plans for medical school are going to stay alive. i have some incredibly hard classes, and although i am excited about learning more in-depth topics in my major field than ever before, i am still nervous about writing this 20-page research paper for chemistry, as well as several additional papers for my other classes.


my winter break was horrible. im so glad to be back at school and away from that negative, mopey atmosphere. but before i left i came out to another one of my parents' friends. she said the same thing as the other one did, that she had been calling it since i was a kid. she says she even told my mother once when i was about 9 or 10, but that my mom didnt believe her. i think she must know deep down though, because not only have i not had a boyfriend in forever, but everyone else seems to know already."

"event","so the other night one of my friends had a question. he asked our mutual friend, who gave an answer. the first guy said he couldnt really take his advice seriously, because he was not of the same religious persuasion (aka, not christian). so the second guy asked another mutual friend who IS a christian what she would say to this question, just to see if their answers differed. so she gave the same answer and was confused, so i chimed in with ""well, im religious and i would say..."" when my friend interrupts and goes ""no, youre not very religious."" i was highly offended, so i said ""yes, i am!"" and he said ""well... you dont act like it."" am i as big a hypocrite as that made me sound?"

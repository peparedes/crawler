"event","I've not posted anything on here since mid October, and haven't viewed anything in over a month so it's fair to say I don't use this place anymore.

I'm not planning on deleting this account, only that it'll be highly unlikely that I use it anymore. If people want to get hold of me then I'll still get message notifications.

If anyone wants to contact me off here then the best place would be Twitter - my username is lupuslondonwolf

Bye LJ - it's been fun."

"event","....I really don't know what to say.

I don't think I've -ever- had so much fun. At any event I've been to. I'm being serious and this statement is bereft of hyperbole.

The five days I was at the hotel were indescribable. It was not just a holiday, it was a break from reality. Everyone was so lovely and so friendly, and the generosity was biblical. I met so many people I wanted to and so many more I didn't even know but now class as friends.

The event ran more smoothly than any furry event I've been to and the parties were legendary.

I'm not going to try and name everyone I met and enjoyed the company of, because there's too many, I'm rubbish at getting contact details and I don't want to miss anyone out, but I do want to thank a few people personally because they've really left their mark:

<lj user=""perro"" /> for being an awesome roommate and a pleasure to be in the company of,
<lj user=""llamaslug"" /> for throwing such excellent room parties, and tolerating us Brits,
<lj user=""woodychitwn"" /> for the Champagne Social, the Dead Dog and being an all round top gent,
<lj user=""yama_inu"" /> for unbelievable generosity to people he'd never even spoken to. Your gift made me cry, you bastard.
<lj user=""redstorm"" /> for not forgetting her Essex routes :P
<lj user=""rynden"" /> for being one of the sweetest guys I've ever met,
<lj user=""bay_retriever"" /> for, amongst many things, breakfast rum :D
<lj user=""rrruff"" /> for still being under the delusion that he can drink more than me,
<lj user=""sashowind"" />, <lj user=""alohawolf"" /> and <lj user=""yelang"" /> for just being a pleasure to talk to.

And to everyone else, both those who I've added and those who I've not got details for (please let me have them), you made MFF something truly special. Rest assured the British will be invading again next year - it's worth every penny and more.

Thank you all so very much :)"

This is up there with any skyscraper in the world - either under construction or complete. And to think the steelwork for this work of art will be rising in June, topping out over 100 metres taller than the gherkin ^^

Good times :D"

I'm going through a contract for a job I will be acting as resident engineer on and it's just so full of stuff that you can't get your head around it's not funny! I'm an engineer - I like plain English! 

Here's an example of one of the clauses:

<i>  Subject to clauses 6.1A and 6.1B, if the constractor carries out additional works or incurs additional costs including any costs arising from delay or disruption to the progress of the works as a result of any of the matters referred to in clause 4.4(a), only in respect to any instructions given under clauses 2.3(a) and 2.3(d), or any matters referred to in paragraphs (b)(d)(e)(f) or (h) of clause 4.4, the engineer shall certify and the employer shall pay to the constractor such additional sums as the engineer after consultation with the contractor considers fair and reasonable provided that no such delay was caused by default on the part of the contractor and provided that the contractor shall have used all reasonable endeavours top mitigate any such additional costs. For the avoidance of doubt, the contractor shall not become entitled to any additonal sum pursuant to this clause 6.1 in respect of any Excluded Prolongation Costs for any perios of delay to the whole or part of the works other than such periods of delay caused soley by any matters referred to clause 4.4(a), only in respect to any instructions given under clauses 2.3(a) and 2.3(d), or any matters referred to in paragraphs (b)(d)(e)(f) or (h) of clause 4.4. The engineer shall be at liberty to instruct that any additional works are charged in accordance with the Daywork Schedule pursuant to clause 2.5. Likewise the engineer shall determine a fair and reasonable deduction to be made in respect of any omission of work.</i>

Aaaaaand breath!"

"event","So the only man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing which killed 270 people has been released on compassionate grounds due to him dying of prostate cancer.

Fair and justified or not?

I'm in two minds over the whole thing. To be honest the whole case stinks. I'm not convinced he was the man responsible in the first place to be honest - I've always thought that he was a sacrificial lamb served up by Gadaffi to improve Libya's international relations.

He has always, to the end, protested his innocence, and was going to launch a second appeal which he only dropped because of the release on compassionate grounds.

Under compassionate grounds the severity of the original crime is not taken into account. A similar thing happened over the release of Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs recently.

It's nice to know that our justice system can be so altruistic, but if he truly was a mass murderer (which I guess we have to take as red as he was convicted for it) should he have been let out. I really don't know.

What has really narked me about the whole saga though is the huge pressure put on our legal system by the endless stream of high profile Americans. Please stop trying to interfere with out judicial system. You really wouldn't give us a second glance if we tried to do the same with you.

What do you think?"

Title: Beautiful Mess 
 

Going out of my nind these days,
like I'm walkin 'round in a haze,
I can't think straight, I can't concentrate,
and I need to shave.

I go to work and I look tired,
The boss man said son you gona get fired,
this ain't your style, and behind my coffee cup,
I just smile.

Chorus
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do.
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in, cause I can't get enough

Can't stop the hunger for your love.
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in. (Ah Ah)

This morning put salt in my coffee
I put my shoes on the wrong feet
I'm loosen my mind I swear, it might be the death of me, but I don't care.

Chorus

Bridge
Is it your eyes,
is it your smile.
All I know is that
your driven me wild.

Chorus(2x)


thats the feeling i have fight now"

"event","well the first two days of school have been fun and boring at the same time. i like most of my classes except mr blessing my english teacher i don't like him he made us do a 5 paragraph essay all ready and my trig teacher is boring but he is cool and kinda funny. 
guess what this means ""soa cah toa""
it means ""some old hippie came ah home trippin on acid""
i thought it was pretty funny

when i got home jimmy was like i'm going to see the dukes of hazard do you want to come? well i'm still in trouble and i cant and i didn't want him to go and we were fighting about it because i didn't want him to go because he was going with josh and ashley and her friend and james who has already tried to break us up once and i didn't want him to do any thing stupid and he was like what do you think i'm gonna do and i was like something stupid and he kept asking what and i was like their are going to be girls there and i don't want you to go and he was like their is not anything you have to worry about i don't want to mess up this good thing ive got

and before that he was like oh joshes little sister tried to get me wet and i had to put her in the shower and that already made me mad because he knows that i think he likes her because he talks about her and he says he thinks of her as his little sister but think of my feelings and i don't want my boyfriend hanging on some other girl you know?

this is the song that i have to say fits our relationship 

Artist: Staind 
Album: Unknown 
Title: Right Here 
 

I know I've been mistaken
But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made
I've got some imperfections
But how can you collect them all and throw them in my face

But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting

I hope you're not intending
To be so condescending it's as much as i can take
and you're so independent
you just refuse to bend so I keep bending till I break

But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting

And if you chose to walk away I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting

I've made a commitment
I'm willing to bleed for you
I needed fulfillment
I found what I need in you

Why can't you just forgive me
I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made along the way
But I always find a way to keep you right here waiting
I always find the words to say to keep you right here waiting

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
And if I chose to walk away would you be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say to keep me right here waiting

and i'm not sure i can find the words to keep him right here waiting 
but i love him so ................

well i'm tired and aggravated so i'm out
love you all

i'm so aggravated i'm in love with jimmy who hangs out with a bunch of girls and says i have nothing to worry about because they are younger than me and they have smaller boobs that mine and they are no competition 

and last night he said he went skinny dipping with a few girls and he was naked and they were in their bras and thongs and then i was pissed so i said i had to go and called gloria and cried for about 45 min and finally called him back and asked him why he went skinny dipping with a bunch of chicks and he changed his story to he was wearing his boxers and he was by himself and when the girls got there he ran to the truck because he for got his pants and he was naked

if anyone can explain that to me than please do because that sounds like crap!!

i'm in love and i'm hurting so bad 

then last night i got yelled at for wanting to wear a pink skirt that was MORE that finger tip length and i was told no even though i was gonna wear shorts under it 

i finally took some pills to help me chill and my mom kept saying what are you on what have you taken and bla bla bla 

then today i broke down and was crying on the phone to gloria for a wile and now i'm exhausted

well any advice??

love you all>>>>

i have been grounded since the beginning of july and i haven't been allowed to do anything
i went school shopping and i'm going again tonight

me and jimmy had dinner with my parents it was so scary because my dad didn't say anything the whole time i swear he said two words to jimmy and they were ""ok bye"" it was ridiculous
then i went to Sarasota beach for a week with my mom and it was fun and then i just got back from my grandparents me and my grandma drove to St Augustine  and stayed there then drove to savanna, Georgia and i just got back home. 
i spent over 260 $ in 4 days on that trip and now i'm gonna go spend more tonight

i'm finally not grounded i'm happy but listen to my dads rules:

no cell phone
no computer 
only 3 20min phone calls a day b4 9:30
no cigarettes
no pills
no alcohol
no drugs

and since he thinks i have only had 3 boyfriends [which i didn't know i wasn't aloud to have one i just thought i wasn't aloud to ""go"" anywhere with boys {that they know of that is}]he said i wasn't aloud so since i have had 3 b\f 8 months before i turned 16 that i'm not aloud to have a boyfriend till 6 months after i turn 16 
so my life has been sucking rite now 

but i'm in love with jimmy so screw him i'm not breaking up with him"

"event","this is the song of me and jimmy's relationship 
in my eyes

Artist: Rise Against  
Album: Siren Song of the Counter-Culture  
Title: Swing Life Away  
 

Am I loud and clear or am I breaking up?
Am I still your charm or am I just bad luck?
Are we getting closer or are we just getting more lost?
I'll show you mine if you show me yours first
Let's compare scars I'll tell you whose is worse
Let's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words

(Chorus)
We live on front porches and swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave 'til the end
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand
I've been here so long I think that its time to move

The winter's so cold summer's over too soon
So let's pack our bags and settle down where palm trees grow
And I've got some friends some that I hardly know
We've had some times I wouldn't trade for the world
We chase these days down with talks of the places that we will go

(Chorus)
We live on front porches and swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave 'til the end
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand

Swing life away[4x]


i just love this song anyways
because its funny that i really wont cross the street [when i am with him] unless he is holding my hand because he protects me. like when i was falling he caught me and helped me get un stuck from the table and stuff like that

well love ya

Title: Don't Take The Girl 

Johnny's daddy was taking him fishin'
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate holdin' a fishing pole
His dad looked down and smiled, said we can't leave her behind
Son i know you don't want her to go but someday you'll change your mind
And johnny said ""take jimmy johnson, take tommy thompson, take my best friend bo
Take anybody that you want as long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy please don't take the girl

Same old boy
Same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips
In front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm said ""if you do what i tell you to, there won't be any harm""

And johnny said ""take my money, take my wallet, take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl
But please don't take the girl

Same old boy
Same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's going to be a little one and she says it's time to go
Doctor says the baby's fine but you'll have to leave
'cause his momma's fading fast and johnny hit his knees and there he prayed
Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please don't take the girl

Johnny's daddy
Was taking him fishin'
When he was eight years old


i just love this song"

Title: Heart-Shaped Box 
 
She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your Heart-Shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn back (Alt: ... when you turn black)

Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! (Alt: Hate! Haight!)
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel's hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of your highness I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint

Forever in debt to your priceless advice

well my summer has been all work and no play,
it makes for a boring day

hopefully tomorrow i will be able to see jimmy 
because i haven't been able to see him because i don't go to school in the morning and i don't get to see him at work because my boss said i will be fired and i don't want that. 

but i'm going to go to see mr. and mrs. smith 
with him and gloria and cory so i'm happy ;)

FALL OUT BOY LYRICS

""Sugar We're Going Down""

Am I more than you bargained for yet
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(A notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)

Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team

We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it

We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it

Is this more than you bargained for yet
Oh don't mind me I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)

Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team

We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
[x2]

Down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it

We're going down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself)
And Sugar, we're going down swinging (Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet (Take aim at myself)
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it

We're going down, down (down, down)
Down, down (down, down)
We're going down, down (down, down)
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it

We're going down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself)
And Sugar, we're going down swinging (Take back what you said)

For you, kissing is about all about following your urges

							  You can keep any relationship hot with your steamy kisses
							  A total spark plug - your kisses are bound to get you in trouble</td></tr><tr><td align=""center"" bgcolor=""#FFA5B2""><h3 style=""margin: 0; border: 0;"">Part Free Love Kisser</h3></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=""#FFDBE0""><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.quizdiva.net/kindkisser/freelove.jpg""></div>
Of all the kissing types, you've racked up the most experience
							  Kissing is no big deal to you - you'll kiss anyone you find hot!
							  It's easy for you to take the plunge and make the first move.
							  And you don't really consider kissing to be cheating!</td></tr></table>

make sure your boobs are in your suit before you get out of the water
    {thats a reminder to me}

diet coke is gross

drive around unknown streets to keep smoking

how about you all

Artist: Gorillaz 
Album: Demon Days  
Title: Feel Good Inc. 
 

Feel Good [8x]

City breaking down on a camel's back
They'll just have to go coz they don't know wack
So all ya fill the streets it's appealing to see
And you won't get undercounted cause you're damn ass free

You got a new horizon it's an ephemaral style
In a melancholy town where we never smile
And all I want to hear is the message beep
My dreams they come a kissin' cause I don't get sleep no

Windmill windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all there on your stride
It is ticking fallin' down
Love forever love is free
Turn forever you and me
windmill windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughing Gas, these Haz mats
Fast Cat, lining them up like ass cracks


Lay these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shoot I'm stepping in hotter this year
Care bear reppin' it harder this year

Watch me as I gravitate hahaha

Gonna ghost town
This Motown
With your sound you're in the blink
Going to bite the dust
Can't fight with us
With your sound you kill the inc.

So don't stop get it, get it
Until your Cheddar's heavy
And watch the way I navigate ha ha

Windmill windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all there on your stride
It is ticking fallin' down
Love forever love is free
Turn forever you and me
windmill windmill for the land
Is everybody in??


this is a good song and i'm really hyper.

i'm going to adventure island tomorrow . yay 

well i hope everyones summer is going great like mine and i miss you all!!!!!

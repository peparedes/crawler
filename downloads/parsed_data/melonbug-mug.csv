Today was alright though, Hmmm i took a 2 hour nap at the nurses pad, then Gavin put a staple in my forearm, i didnt think he was serious, but he fucking lodged a staple in my skin. i pulled it out in 11th period and i kinda got blood everywhere, but i told my teacher i got stung by a bee. Went to Dons right after school, jamed, didnt do much, brendans new bass is the sickest thing though, way to go brendan, nerd. got home, took a nap, smacked a bitch, layed an egg, jumped on top of my refrigerator, my hands grew 20 times in diameter, pressed my clothing, drank, played some PIKIMIN.

Another page of i'm sorry's addressed to me 
Another story for the collection of memories folded neatly 
And I will never make the same mistake..."

caring for him..am i stupid?nah!well can

actually having a crush on someone else..ironically i know d gurl..

tsk..nweiz i felt disheartened coz i thought i was like 
ummm...the one he liked?!?!nevermind..
but now i realize how fantasist and stooopid i am..
its so unfair,very unjust but sometyms we just have to accept 
that that's just the world works,if u love some1, every little thing he does for you 
is a big thing but for him it's just a friendly gesture or sumthing and doesnt know

"event","these past few weeks I've been confused sometimes I wonder if
I'm better off alone.
you fall in love then break your heart.
you fall in love again
its never ending.

I GUESS IM GIVING UP ON LOVE..
'cause it really kind of sucks

uninspired and growing tired why am I always
so attracted to drama? so here I am grown up at 23
WILL SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT IT TAKES TO BE HAPPY?

I play in my band and write a lot of songs
about relationships and how mine went wrong.
maybe I'll meet that special guy along the way
then he'll break my heart and leave me crying."

I spent last weekend stressed as fuck while my posse (Snakebite and Aaron) went to an island without me.&nbsp; There was absolutely no reason for me to feel left out; they were going to a bunch of archaeological sites which would have bored me to tears, and I had shit-tons to do anyway.&nbsp; As such, I only felt a LITTLE&nbsp;left out. 

So this weekend consisted of mildly studying for midterms and stressing over, and procrastinating, a long-ass research paper on the worst of 5 evils: the least boring paper topic for my Art and Archaeology class.&nbsp; I also researched and, with the help of Snakebite on the phone, reserved us a hostel for Amsterdam. Eight fuckin' nights, baby!

Itinerary:
Friday 5:20am: Athens to Budapest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:10am: Budapest to Amsterdam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:00am: check into Inner Amsterdam Hostel
Friday-Thursday: Hang out, party, explore things that are legal in Amsterdam, visit a museum or something so I have something to tell my Greek teacher in the past tense when I get back
Friday, the 31st: register for classes at USC. on my laptop. at a hostel in Amsterdam. possibly find a halloween party? or just be the only ones walking around in costume :-P
Saturday 8:30pm: Amsterdam to Budapest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:30pm: Arrive in Budapest
????? - badassitude and awesomeness for 14 hours in Budapest.
Sunday 12:00noon: Budapest to Athens

We've been doing a ton of research (we = Snakebite), and we're quite excited about... things.&nbsp; Hey, it's legal.&nbsp; Though not as much nowadays as a few years ago, apparently.&nbsp; And even though the newness of the legislation means that many shops supposedly haven't gotten the hint... we'll probably stay away from things that aren't totally kosher.&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp; Btw: special brownies apparently come in many, varied, not-necessarily-brownie form, and they're called &quot;spacecakes.&quot; &nbsp;But they wouldn't last the 3 months till I'm back in the States, sorry ;-).

So anyway, this week, I pwned both of my midterms on Monday and got my paper extended to the week after I get back from fall break.&nbsp; Which is just posponing the inevitable, I know, especially since I'm now going to have THREE&nbsp;papers due in the space of 2 or 3 weeks... we'll see how I&nbsp;do.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll be rejuvenated and ready to rock after Amsterdam O:-).

So THEN I started to get sick.&nbsp; Don't ask me why.&nbsp; I've had a couple friends, Maddy and Meri, who've been pitifully sick for the better part of a week.&nbsp; I blame them.&nbsp; So I napped yesterday and begged out of food shopping this morning so I&nbsp;could keep sleeping... but I&nbsp;feel better.&nbsp; And there's nothing else to worry about: tonight we make gringo greek tacos and ghetto margaritas, staying up entirely too late, then i have class from 8:30-1:30, and then our plane leaves at 5:20 the next morning.&nbsp; Which means my sleep schedule's gonna be ALL&nbsp;fucked up, so I'm glad I got my sleep this morning."

"event","So apparently, in addition to letting myself get uber-stressed out, getting less than half of the necessary sleep every night for the better part of a week is also a way to get myself sick. I'm getting really good at this. You know, if I every actually want to get sick, I know ALL the tricks.

We spent a week in Crete. It was fun; they carted us around in 5 buses, each bus going to different minoan/mycenean sites on Crete depending on what different archaeology classes needed to see. they got us up stupid-early every morning (i did not, in fact, get sick on crete, though i was mildly sleep-deprived) and we were hustled around to different places, some of which were interesting while some were mind-numbingly boring, and then we usually got to our hotel by 4pm. Other buses go to their hotels (or ours, we tended to meet up a bit for the evenings) 1-3 hours earlier, leaving time for naps... but i'm not bitter.

the ferries to and from the island were overnight ferries, which meant that they got us cabins and that we partied in them instead of sleeping :). epic times were had by all.

then i somehow got through an entire week, the later part of which was rife with lack of sleep (maybe tuesday-saturday or so?), and was effectively useless on sunday and then proceded to skip class on monday and tuesday, to return to life on wednesday ready and rarin. i did nothing but sleep those two days, practically. it was awesome.

So now, we're going on a weekend trip to someplace in mainland Greece, Argolid, which will be like Crete except only a couple days and everybody stays in the same city. which means crazy party fun in the city :)

dude, one night in Crete, me and my friend Maddy met these Greek guys who worked at a gyro place. they took us out clubbing. it was kind of boring (europeans dont fucking dance!), and we had to leave &quot;early&quot; (3 am) since we were getting up at like 7, but it was awesome.&nbsp; Maddy thought they were gay and totally wanted me, and i guess she'd know better than i.&nbsp; it wasn't like they were hitting on me, and totally took the hint when i, for instance, danced with Maddy, so no harm no foul.

And yeah, in the last week of october, we have a week-long Fall Break... and most people have already had their plans for weeks now, but me and snakebite and maddy are finally getting around to making ours. and our destination... *drumroll*... AMSTERDAM!&nbsp; more details to follow.

so, I don't know how to describe this but i feel like i should try.&nbsp; i've been hearing bits and pieces about all the bullshit that's happening back in the US, with the economic crisis, the buyout, and all the complicated stuff that follows.&nbsp; and i admit i've Stumbled Upon a few VERY alarmist articles or whatever that have set my imagination running in some very interesting directions.

basically, hyperinflation? martial law? WWIII? i dont know enough about economics to know what's reasonable and what's exaggerated, and i certainly havne't been following things enough to have more than an inkling.&nbsp; if anybody reading this has been following enough to feel comfortable giving me a summary, shoot me an email.

in any case, i feel like i should write something.&nbsp; too bad i'm an awful writer. maybe i'll try anyway."

Warning: graphic descriptions of partying follow.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Thursday: class till 1:30. errands in the afternoon, including buying our ferry tickets to and from Mykonos and reserving our hotel (less than 24 hours in advance).</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">10:15- begin partying. I had previously promised the PetNet girls that I'd get them drunk. At 10:15 Snakebite and Maddy showed up, so we started hanging out (read: drinking).</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">12:00-12:30 - the PetNet girls FINALLY SHOW UP, already quite tipsy, bringing two guys in tow. Somebody'd been busy...</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The guys were cool, we hung out and played Blank White Cards. Fucking awesome game, way beyond my expectations.  Details available.  Around 2:30 we were yelled at by some little old Greek lady, and finished the game in whispers.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">4ish? - Everybody but Snakebite and Maddy leave.  Maddy passes the fuck out on our couch.  Rachel and I clean up, make breakfast, etc.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">5:15 &ndash; we leave, catch the metro to the port, and get on our boat.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">7:30 &ndash; out boat leaves for Mykonos. We catch short, cold, uncomfortable naps during the 5+hour trip.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">12:50pm &ndash; we land in Mykonos.  We're met at the port by this hilarious Greek man who manages the cute little hotel.  He liked to sass me.  We got along.  He also told me that he thought doing philosophy could be very stressful.  Must ponder this.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The hotel was cool, small, and right on the beach.  Which was gorgeous.  So were the people on it.  We moved into our room then continued napping, slightly more successfully, on the beach.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">7:30 &ndash; caught a ride with manager (he never did tell us his name) to Mykonos Town.  That's right, a town named after the island.  The island's kind of a shit hole, actually, it's made up of THE town, which is full of tourist shops, tourist food, and tourist bars, and a bunch of beaches with their own contingents of food and bars and hotels.  The majority of things outside the town, and a few of the biggest things INSIDE the town, were closed.  We apparently just missed the end of the high season.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">8:00 &ndash; gyros for dinner! 2-euro gyros were by far the cheapest thing available for actual meals. I generally ate 2.  Then we walked around the town for, you know, a few hours, looking for these crazy clubs we'd heard about.  We saw a couple, one called &ldquo;Ramrod&rdquo; with a big rainbow over the name.  Decided we'd probably be out of place.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">10 &ndash; met some girls from California who were visiting the island during a break from THEIR study-abroad program in Rome.  Hung out until 11:30ish when we heard music.  That's the trick in Mykonos: there aren't huge signs and the city is literally labyrinthine, so just follow the music when you're looking for a party.  We did, and found the (according to these girls) most hopping place still open: The Scandinavian.  Got in free, probably because it was early and the ratio was 5:1.  I love my life.  Did I mention the ratio in my program is over 2:1?  Anyway, we danced, I met a couple people, though it was hard to chat after a while cause the place got PACKED.  Think mosh-pit.  We had brought our own, very classy water bottles full of vodka and fanta, and if we weren't allowed to have them we never got caught.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">1:30am &ndash; left the club.  This was really early by Greek (European?) standards: you don't start until like midnight and you go late.  1:30 is like 11 back home, the peak of the night. We grabbed a taxi back to the hotel and CRASHED.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">2 &ndash; first real bed-sleep since Wednesday night.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">10:00- woke up for shitty hotel breakfast. Went right back to sleep. It was gross, overcast, and rainy, so we didn't feel bad about it at all.  At some point in the afternoon we DID get up, and since it wasn't raining particularly, took a hike down the path that runs along the coast to see some of the other beaches.  During the day there's very little to do in Mykonos, and literally nothing to do if it's not beach weather.  So we walked this path, taking time to climb promontories and explore small castles (see my facebook pictures), down a few beaches to Paradise Beach.  Same boring shit as all the others.  It had a club, right there on the beach, which was all closed down.  Had a pool and everything.  Kinda sorry I missed it.  I'll have to go back :).</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">10pm- we waited till this time to go to town, (waking up from our post-hike nap) because we didn't need to spend 3 hours in the town waiting for things to open.  It was pouring rain at this point, so we called a taxi instead of walking to the bus station.  We still got pretty wet walking through town to a gyro place though.  We sat in there drying and eating our gyros, listening to the foreigners of various flavors coming and going, until we heard music.  So off we went to The Scandinavian.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">11:00pm &ndash; got in free again at The Scandinavian.  Guess poor weather makes for slower nightlife; I don't think it ever got as hopping as the night before, and it took much longer.  More dancing, more sneaking water bottle booze so we didn't have to pay for it.  My backpack was MUCH lighter on the trip home, lemme tell you.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">4:00am &ndash; left The Scandinavian... I think.  Times are all approximations, this one particularly so.  I remember getting back to the room and deciding we weren't done, and taking shots.  Then I remember looking at my watch and saying &ldquo;It's 9am, time for breakfast!&rdquo; Don't ask me where those 4 or 5 hours went.  Talking and drifting in and out of consciousness.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">9 &ndash; breakfast, then a 2-hour nap until 11:30.  Check-out time was noon.  Damnit.  So we packed up our shit, dropped our bags off in the luggage waiting room, and crashed on the beach.  They were cool about us borrowing our shitty (and I mean SHITTY) bath towels for it.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">5:30pm &ndash; our manager friend sassed me some more as he took us back to the port.  He told me not to let philosophy stress me out too much.  It was interesting... I've been trying, actively, emotionally, to not let myself get stressed out, particularly since last week when I was hit over the head with the fact that THAT's why I got sick.  And I think it's been working.  Kind of.  It's hard, of course, but Mykonos helped.  The motto of Psarou Beach Hotel was, in fact, &ldquo;No stress..!!&rdquo;, so there was a kind of symmetry to all of this.  Hopefully it'll work out for me.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">6:55 &ndash; our ferry back to Athens is scheduled to leave</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">7:30 &ndash; it arrives to pick us up. We have a shitty, overpriced little pizza for dinner (complete with two complimentary german beers!) and nap.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">11:30 or so we land.  We stumble in our half-waking state to the metro back home.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">12:30 &ndash; we get most of the way home, then try to transfer to another line to get the rest of the way.  Sorry, says the man in Greek, you can't get there from here.  That line is closed for the night.  Balls.  We walk.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">1:30am on monday morning &ndash; after walking home and showering, I collapse into bed.<br /><br />So.&nbsp; How was YOUR&nbsp;weekend? :-D</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">And I got pretty good sleep that night too.  I felt totally on my game today.  Except a very odd experience at lunch: numerous times, while sitting, I felt dizzy.  I continued talking, never felt like I was going to pass out or anything, just... dizziness.  Hadn't been drunk in 24 hours, had sufficient water and food and sleep... riddle me this.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Oh, and we did the math: from 10pm Thursday to 10pm Sunday, 72 hours: 30 of them were stone-cold sober. The other 42 (note the number), were not.  I never got ridiculously drunk, nothing like a hangover ever, but just a fairly sustained state of &ldquo;moderation.&rdquo;  My self-appointed chaperons at CYA would be proud.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> </meta></meta><br />"

"event","Things are looking up again.&nbsp; I'm slowly expanding my circle of awesome people who like to party (goth clubs and BWC), though it may be a week or two before either of those actually happen.... BECAUSE:

-tomorrow night, more chill party with a larger group of people (still no other GUYS though. it's not my fault, the ratio here is like 2.1 to 1 in my favor!)
-Friday, leaving with Snakebite (Rachel) for Mykonos, with any luck! Weather could be a problem, though, we wouldn't want to go and then not be able to get back in time for class :-\
-Sunday returning from whatever island we end up going to
-Tuesday night, beginning of week-long program-wide Crete trip. should be some nightlife/BWC opportunities in Crete, though O:-)

I'm feeling better, working on getting adequate sleep, and am hanging out with my cool people and having fun.&nbsp; I still have to look into that Athens Singers thing, though.&nbsp; No word yet.&nbsp; But they sing in English, i'm SO there.

I've got two morning-days each week, and two afternoon-days. These are days that i have 2 classes before or two classes after my Modern Greek class which is every day at noon.&nbsp; This means that, twice a week, an afternoon day comes before a morning day and i have OVER 24 HOURS of seemingly straight class.&nbsp; It's not ACTUALLY straight class, of course, I&nbsp;have a few hours here and there and the whole night/sleep thing, but getting out at 6:50pm and having class again at 8:30am is NOT a great way to get my homework done AND&nbsp;get me enough sleep, especially when it's so tempting to do OTHER&nbsp;things after 7pm.&nbsp; Like make and eat dinner.&nbsp; But i'm handling it.&nbsp; It's not like they ask too much of us, and it's not like there's ANY&nbsp;practical difference between an A and a C-. pass-fail, baby!

Speaking of class, I've gotta go learn about the European Union now. Joy. Peace."

"event","So on Thursday I went home early, missing two classes, because I&nbsp;had a headache, a stomach ache, and I was exhausted.&nbsp; I&nbsp;DID feel sick, but it didn't occur to me until one of the women working the reception desk mentioned that I didn't look well and told me to talk to Nadia (EVERYBODY knows me around here: i'm that guy who lost his luggage for a fucking week).&nbsp; Nadia insisted I&nbsp;go home and even got me a ride so I didn't have to hike up the mountain on foot.&nbsp; I&nbsp;slept pretty much until Modern Greek the next day, which incidentally included missing my OTHER two classes.&nbsp; After I got sent home, the headache and stomach unhappiness got worse, and have been fluctuating but steadily decreasing all weekend.

Nadia thinks it's from stress, and that sure as hell wouldn't be a stretch.&nbsp; Since I get sick all the fucking time, and generally when I'm under a lot of pressure (working a show, for instance).&nbsp; The new apartment, new classes, new city, geographically unpleasant location of my apartment, in addition to the new COUNTRY AND LANGUAGE, together with losing my luggage, probably qualify as sufficient stress for make me spontaneously combust, so the fact that I&nbsp;got a little stomach flu instead should probably be considered a stroke of good luck.&nbsp; In any event, I&nbsp;still feel weird NOW after walking down to the school (because where else could I&nbsp;get internet?)

But yeah, I went out Friday night (it was our goth club excursion! I&nbsp;couldn't wuss out just cause I was SICK... :-P)... plus this one woman told me to &quot;make sure I&nbsp;talk to people and do things&quot; because that would help with the stress, &quot;but not with alcohol. Because that won't help.&quot; &quot;Haha, yeah I&nbsp;know.&quot; *glug glug glug*&nbsp; How old do these people think I&nbsp;am?&nbsp; I didn't drink MUCH Friday (or last night O:-) and I&nbsp;don't know how much I would have had if she HADN'T said that, but I&nbsp;know it wouldn't have been more.

New plan:&nbsp;instead of tryign the goth club again tonight (there's supposed to be actual DANCING&nbsp;on saturdays!) I think we're goign to find an irish pub to see the USC&nbsp;vs Ohio game :-P.&nbsp; Cause that feels way more interesting and realistic for my current energy level.&nbsp; Besides, getting gothed out once per weekend is enough for me."

"event","I FINALLY GOT MY LUGGAGE!&nbsp; After a few false alarms, the Athens airport finally delivered my two bags to CYA at like 7pm last night.&nbsp; I took them home (an ordeal), unpacked, and changed into fresh new clothes.&nbsp; It was very exciting.

Now my issues are minor, like finding a place to get my phone activated so I&nbsp;can start getting people's numbers and having contact with the world.

So, this weekend. Ridiculous.&nbsp; I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning three nights in a row (including last night, but I&nbsp;didn't have class until noon today).&nbsp; Not sure I want to do that EVERY&nbsp;weekend, but... I&nbsp;DO want to start going to beaches and islands now that I have clothes and my swimsuit et cetera.&nbsp; Not sure if I want to find a friend or two to go with, or if I&nbsp;want to have an adventure by myself.&nbsp; I'd force myself to meet more people that way.&nbsp; Figuring it all out by myself, though, would take a couple hours on a computer.&nbsp; Maybe Tuesday while I'm Skyping... or I&nbsp;could just ask all my friends who keep talking about going.&nbsp; Hmm.

This school is so funny about alcohol.&nbsp; Apparently in years past they ENCOURAGED&nbsp;drinking, even mildly excessive drinking (or so I hear).&nbsp; But ever since I&nbsp;got here they've been treating us like children and drilling it into our heads NOT TO DRINK, not to have parties, not to be loud EVER, not to come to class hungover or smelling of alcohol, not to MISS&nbsp;class because of alcohol, etc etc ad nauseum.&nbsp; Man up, people!&nbsp; They were throwing the threat of deportation around, literally, like it was their only meager defense against the ever-present forces of annihilation.&nbsp; I&nbsp;heard a story about this guy getting drunk, trying to climb the Acropolis at night, and getting put in jail for three days, and that's OBVIOUSLY the main reason they're all daddy-knows-best right now.&nbsp; It probably happened last semester or something.&nbsp; Maybe the authorities threatened their institution?&nbsp; I can't imagine ONE dumbass, even dumbfuckery of that magnitude, scaring these people that much.

"event","This weekend was a short one (only two days) because we had class on Friday.&nbsp; Friday night me, most of my roommates, and the aforementioned cool friends of mine got together at their place to hang out, have dinner, and do a little partying.&nbsp; They made AMAZING&nbsp;food, and we brought the beverages.&nbsp; OK, <strong><em><u>i</u></em></strong> brought the beverages.&nbsp; But my roommates are in the process of paying me back, so you know.&nbsp; Then we went out to the district of Plaka in search of some kind of night life.&nbsp; We didn't find anything after walking around for a bit, and EVERYBODY but me and this girl Rachel wanted to pussy out and go home.&nbsp; So we then proceeded to continue walking around for another THREE&nbsp;HOURS.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I&nbsp;got home at like quarter to 5 in the morning, having done LAPS&nbsp;around the Acropolis, and having had quite interesting conversations on the way, but completely fruitless in terms of nightlife.<br /><br />I went back to Plaka twice in the next 24 hours.&nbsp; Once during the day to do a little window shopping, and again last night with Rachel and a guidebook that actually TOLD us where the nightlife was.&nbsp; It's really awkward to meet people at bars and clubs.&nbsp; And they're all really just bars.&nbsp; Some just have music, but very few have actual dancing, and not a whole lot of it.&nbsp; Not at ALL like the clubs I'm used to back in the States.&nbsp; Maybe i'm just finding the wrong clubs though.&nbsp; You can bet I'll keep looking :).<br /><br />In the meantime...

"event","I want my luggage.

It feels like I've been here for WAY longer than 4 days.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think of things I've done 4 or 6 hours ago and it feels like it was yesterday or earlier this week.&nbsp; 

 Many people speak English, just like I was told.&nbsp; Especially the younger people.&nbsp; I went into this little grocery, which was really just fresh fruits and vegetables, and the man I started speaking to had to go get a young man (16ish, maybe) to talk to us in English.&nbsp; Most people in shops do have some English, though, or they have access to somebody who does.&nbsp; I just had my first Greek class today, and I'm excited to get out there and start saying Yah-sahs (Hello) and Kahlimera (good morning) to people :-P.&nbsp; Maybe I'll throw in a couple Greek words every time I post, both to help me learn them and in case anybody's interested.

That class we kind of jumped right into; the others were general first-day classes. Talked about the course, not the material of the course.&nbsp; those two classes are Ancient Greek and Aegean Art and Archaeology (an 8:30am, on-site class. I'm only taking it because they take us to all the cool old places and tell us about them; I'd never go by myself).&nbsp; The other one is the only philosophy class they offer: Greek Metaphysics, essentially.&nbsp; The class and teacher seem fun, and the material is not something I've specifically covered before, so hopefully I'll learn something.&nbsp; She said the class is designed for non-philosophy majors, so I'm not concerned about it being too hard.
 
 We're still looking for good, cheap shopping.&nbsp; We live in the more expensive area of town, up this giant-ass hill from the school. Like 20 minutes one way.&nbsp; And the walk IS tough, but I'm not too out of shape, and my legs will only get better from all the exercise.&nbsp; Yesterday after orientation I, on the spur of the moment, continued walking up the hill beyond my street.&nbsp; It became a criss-cross all the way up, with vegetation and viewing places instead of apartments and so on.&nbsp; At the very top was a bell, a cafe, and a viewing platform with those stationary binoculars you have to pay to use... all of Athens was laid out before me.&nbsp; I could see the Acropolis, the ancient stadium RIGHT next to my school... I'll see if I can get some of my pictures on my computer and put 'em on here or Facebook.&nbsp; The scenery is BEAUTIFUL.
 
 They still have no idea where my luggage is.&nbsp; Nadia, one of the head honchos here, said &quot;if you dont have it by Friday, THEN we can start worrying.&quot;&nbsp; I can't imagine I'll have it by friday; the website doesn't know where it is, and i don't think we can even get ahold of the freaking airport.&nbsp; It's starting to really wear on me, only having two changes of clothes.&nbsp; And not having all these things... like my CELL PHONE and my transformer, especially.&nbsp; I was able to borrow an adapter to charge my Treo and my laptop, thank god.&nbsp; But I can't really use my external, which has literally everything on it.&nbsp; All I can really do without it is internet, type and Skype.&nbsp; Which ARE the essentials... it's just frustrating. 
 
The current plan, for anybody who's interested, is for me to jump on AIM and Skype on Tuesday afternoon my time.&nbsp; Early morning (6-9am) for the east coast, stupid early morning (3-6am) for the West. I probably won't stay on for 3 hours, since both of those times are really inconvenient for everybody.&nbsp; I&nbsp;just don't know when I'll want to sit in the Student Union (the only place I&nbsp;can get internet, we don't have it in our apartments) between 6 and 8 at night, which is when it apparently closes.&nbsp; That might work better... But i'll probably only do it if somebody wants to meet me :).&nbsp; So lemme know! Comments are available for a reason, kids ;-).

I&nbsp;don't suppose anybody wants to spend the ridiculous amount of cash required to send post, but just in case you do (postcards and letters should be reasonable at least) you can send them to the school (but addressed to me) at:
Pl. Stadiou 5
116 35 Athens

I miss you guys!

"event","Holy shit.&nbsp; The last 48 hours were ridiculous.
Tampa to Philly.
Philly to Rome.
Rome to Athens.
Arriving in Athens, I discover that somewhere in the previous two shuffles, my bags escaped.&nbsp; And of course, at the lost luggage counter they ask you questions like, &quot;What is your cellphone number?&quot; and &quot;Where are you staying?&quot;&nbsp; (I don't HAVE&nbsp;a cell phone that works in Greece. I&nbsp;brought a GSM cell phone to put a Greek SIM card in... but it's in my luggage. &quot;It's in my luggage&quot; has become a common theme of mine.)&nbsp; Also, I didn't know where I lived yet, and the address to the school...... ON MY LUGGAGE.&nbsp; I was supposed to be met at the airport, with the address to my apartment and the keys thereto, but the school thought I was arriving on August 1, not September 1 like everybody else.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;got a taxi who didn't know where CYA was.&nbsp; He had to call somebody who got on Google or something.&nbsp; Oh, did I&nbsp;mention he didn't speak a WORD of english?&nbsp; I knew more words in Greek than he knew in English.&nbsp; Fun times.

So I&nbsp;eventually made it.&nbsp; Got my shit, had the school call the airport so my bags'll be delivered here when they find them.&nbsp; *sigh*

Since then thing's have been great.&nbsp; Met a bunch of people, did some exploring of the area... finally found towels and sheets so I&nbsp;could shower and sleep last night :).&nbsp; And I've got a roommate who's big on cooking (yeah, he's WAY&nbsp;gay. and he got the single room, the asshole), so hopefully I'll eat well this semester. &nbsp;

For the next couple of days we're getting books, being oriented, and meeting fellow students and faculty.&nbsp; Classes start Thursday.&nbsp; And we're already trying to figure out what we're doing this weekend.&nbsp; Beach, island... so many options.&nbsp; Shoot me emails or comments!&nbsp; I don't have internet in my apartment :(."

"event","I can't believe I'm going to do this.&nbsp; Starting a LiveJournal.&nbsp; But we'll see how it works.&nbsp; I'll try to keep things coherent, and reasonably short.&nbsp; Because the point is for my friends to read it and know how my semester's going (and so you don't forget about me), not for me to ramble or rant.&nbsp; Or record insignificant details.&nbsp; But that latter'll happen anyway, cause what else would I talk about?

I drove cross-country with Big Ron for 3 days.&nbsp; We're old hands at this.&nbsp; Nothing special.&nbsp; Made good time, actually.&nbsp; We were concerned about Hurricane Fay, which was supposed to hit land ON TOP of our house.&nbsp; But she heard we were coming and not only decided to land 100 south of us instead, but then veer off east and go clear across the state.&nbsp; We didn't even get rain.

In other news, I'm working on getting my Student Visa, and had a lovely experience with a mid-level beaurocrat in the process.&nbsp; I'm getting a laptop to take with me to Greece, a new cell phone that will theoretically be able to function in Greece once I buy a card thingie there... and a bunch of new clothes.&nbsp; More than I expected.&nbsp; Don't worry, I'm not developing fashion-sense or anything... not very quickly anyway.&nbsp; Other than that, things are pretty dull.&nbsp; I should work on learning Greek, though... I've got 10 days.&nbsp; It could happen."

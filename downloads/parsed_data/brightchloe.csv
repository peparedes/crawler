"event","&nbsp; Egh, I hate being so uncomfortable, its like everywhere I turn someone always thinks about <em>that subject</em>. I just want to get away from that, or at least make people forget so I can get back to my life. I hate being around Lana knowing that she's not comfortable around me, I mean, we're friends.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; Why did I have to do it? It... I... I don't know how to feel, this is no good. Clark probably hates me, he's in love with Lana, I know it. I'm still not sure how I really feel, I've always had a thing for him, but I <em>think</em>... I know he doesn't feel the same way; he can't.<br /><br /><br />Everything has turned into doubt.<br /><br />&nbsp;-Chloe"

"event","&nbsp; Wow, I haven't felt this nervous in so long, I know I have to have a talk with Clark, but I don't know what to say to him at all, nothing is coming to mind. We need to clear the air and get this out, I have no idea what's going on, if that was just a one time thing or is there something more to this? Sometimes I really hate being a teenager... too many mixed emotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I know I've always had a thing for Clark, but I've never really took any action on it, I've always thought that he just thought of me as a friend and nothing else, he'd never showed any sign... but then neither have I. I've always been the bright and shiny girl of Smallville, the one that people turned to when they needed information on someone or something, and I like being the one to help; but what if I'm the one that's in need?

&nbsp;I just don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp;


I'm going to call Clark to meet me at the Talon, maybe things will just unravel.&nbsp;

"event","Hmmm... nothing much to type about now is there?&nbsp;
I just got back home from a long walk around with Lana, we were just talking about anything and everything, just really random things I guess.&nbsp;

Lois keeps talking about how she saw me and Clark kiss, and I'm not sure if I should just forget about it and move on with my life, but another part of me wants to kiss him again. I'm confused, and I don't know what to think... Maybe I should talk to Clark about this, I don't know what to make of the situation. Anyways, I just can't believe she just stood there and watched! ... At least me and Clark had fun talking about what things we could do to her, that lightened up my mood, haha.

Well, I think I'm just going to go watch some TV and have a cup of coffee.

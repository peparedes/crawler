My new cell phone is AWESOME.  Icarus makes a kick-ass background.

I got lunch today with a few friends (Sam - from Santa Cruz High, Jennica - from Santa Cruz High and also a friend of Jeff's, and Chris - from my Philosophy of Mind class).

I've been playing Kingdom of Loathing.  It's pretty fun.  If anyone plays, look me up.  My screen name is Skryt.

I'm awfully happy about Emma moving into her dorm.  She's adorable, and she appears to be quite quite happy with it all.  She's in Porter College.  And gorgeous.

After many happenings, I will no longer have the two classes I was excited about, which were Sign Language and Ethics.  Their replacements, respectively, are Philosophy of Mind and Psychology of women.

I lack interest in my entire semester.

Although, there is good news.  I discovered that I had 9.5 credits that I completely forgot about from my days of homeschooling and SCHS.

It doesn't help me fulfill requirements other than pure credits, however.

I bought the starter set of and a booster pack for the D&D Miniatures game.  It's fairly cool, although I don't have the patience to read the rather long instruction booklet though.

Emma is in San Francisco for now.  She's babysitting her cousins, or something.  I miss and love her so damn much.

I'm considering a new tattoo, which is from 28 Days Later.  It's scrawled on the wall inside of a church towards the beginning of the movie:

REPENT
THE END IS
EXTREMELY
FUCKING
NIGH

Torrey is coming to SC in a few days.  It's rather exciting.  I look forward to seeing him.

I'm going to see Corpse Bride with Amber and her boyfriend, Teddy.  That should be fun.

I need to spend my $50 GAP giftcard... hmm... what to get, what to get...

"event","Okay, so, I'm almost done with Marvel: 1602, which is awesome.  Doom is just oh so much hotter when he's all medieval and shit.

I also STRONGLY suggest Superman: Red Son.  It's one of those 'what if' comics in which Superman crash lands in soviet Russia instead of Kansas.  It's pretty hot."

It's a quote of Emma's from tonight:
""I'm happy... in my pants... which are over there."""

Anyways, I just got back from Emma's, where we celebrated seeing each other for the last time for two weeks.  My neck looks like it was pecked by ducks.  Angry ducks.  And pecked repeatedly.

I love her so much.

While I was at her house, I ordered a nice new Timbuk2 bag (Small, brown-light blue-brown).  I'm amped."

"event","If you're in the market for a lubricant, I strongly recommend Probe brand lubricant, which can be purchased for $5 at Camouflage.  It's thick, so it's good for anal.  It's safe, so it's good for oral.  And it's slimy, for it's good for anything else.  It also cleans up nicely.  And it's condom safe."

That's two days in a row, if anyone wants to keep track.

It's even better the second time."

We saw Howl's Moving Castle today, and it was awesome.  I strongly recommend it.

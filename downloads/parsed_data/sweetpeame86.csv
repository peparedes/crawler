im thrilled.. usually... dont get me wrong im at a great place in my life right now... i think. i have a great boyfriend.. and im in school.

but im not where i want to be. not where i wanted to be. i wanted to have already declared my major, to be well on my way to graduation, to have a fantastic gpa...to know where i was going in life, to... so many things. and i dont and im not. and it bothers me.

and it bothers me that when i look back on my life so far i have so many regrets. and that i keep telling myself ill change and that ill live my life differently so that from this day forward i can look back and not feel that way... but its never any different...

what no one realizes.. is that i have to work so much harder for even the little accomplishments than they think i do. lauren... she skates through school.. it comes so easy for her. me? i work like crazy and still dont do as well as id like to.

i dont know.. 

busy with finals. busy with shawn. weve been out alot lately. 
had an eeg the other day. and the one day i should have had seizures- i didnt. frustration.

im just... i dont know.. one of those days maybe??"

im an aunt again!! for me, this makes number 3, for my sister, number 1.

ive got a neice, 2 nephews, and another nephew due this may!!
needless to say im thrilled.

maybe i should explain how this is divided up-

my step sister- just had my nephew
my best friend ((we will call her sister though))- has my other nephew and neice, and another one on the way.

i have a ton of pictures of all of them. i think im going to make my sister a collage for her birthday. or something.

my boyfriend is in germany- im not sure if i mentioned that already or not. but he is. which is nice because i can actually talk to him on the phone now. im lovin it. im getting addicted to to calls though- soo spoiled. ive refilled my phone card more times than i can count. hopefully i get another call soon.

spring break started. im procrastinating. have a ton of homework to do.. and i just cant focus. its disgusting.

i started having seizures again- well i had them a couple weeks ago, then they stopped and then thursday or friday they came back full force. i think its because of stress because im having tons!! but i see the dr on the 16th so.. we shall see.

my sister.. aww shes crazy but i love her anyway. shes so random.. i love it...

anyway. i need to scoot for now. but, more soon. very soon.

"event","I woke up this morning, and immediately wished i could go back to sleep. i was having such a good dream..
have you ever had one of those dreams, that is so good, so real, so perfect.. that all you want to do is go back to sleep.. back to the dream??

thats what happened this morning. i was having such a good dream. and it was so perfect.
im not sure why but i was at the airport, really early- way before the time my boyfriend was supposed to fly in to come home. so for some reason i was there.. with my mom or something, and all of the sudden someone called my name..i turned around and it was my boyfriend. telling me he had told me he was on a later flight so he could surprise me. and i swear the hug lasted forever.

i woke up this morning and it took me 5 minutes to realize that it wasnt real. -sigh-

there is only one month between separating now, from the month he comes home. march.. thats the ONLY thing in the way. so how do i make it go faster? i dont know what im going to do. time seems to be coming to a halt.

maybe, once i can call him and talk to him whenever i want, it will help. but i sort of wonder if it will just make&nbsp;me miss him more. aye!!

---

then.. i had a dr appt today. and he said something about the neuros notes, so i asked him what they said. and the words out of his mouth.. i almost started crying.. i dont know which was worse.. being pissed off or being sad too.&nbsp;
""so what did his notes say?""
""that this is something you are going to have to deal with for the rest of your life. and you will always be on medication. that you cant stop taking your medicine just because you arent having seizures. just because you think you are better""
""yea but they could go away right?""
""not likely erin. this is something you will have forever""
""but.. okay it would have been ok to lie""
""no it wouldnt have""
""-angry look- fine what else did they say?""
""will likely never drive""
""EXCUSE ME??? never???""
""id love to see him eat his words, but.. you have to go 6 months without a seizure""
""but ive been taking them for 2 weeks.. im 2 weeks closer... ive never taken them for 2 weeks straight""
""i know that.good job.""

ugh.
then i had to talk to him about the ocd. since my other dr cant give meds. but everything he was going to give me would have upped my chances of having seizures.
so i asked if any of them would make me gain weight ""all of them have a chance of doing that""
""never mind then i dont want it. i dont want something thatll make me gain because then ill stop taking them and itll be a viscious circle""
""at this point because you arent having seizures id rather not put you on anything at all.""
""okay.""
""but CBT is an option. like your other dr said""
""i dont like popping my comfy bubble.""

i guess that just about sums up the day.&nbsp;

maybe talking to my boyfriend will make it better.. or anyone. i refuse to accept that this could be a forever thing. and that i will always be on meds. and the chances of not driving. NO!! i absolutely will NOT.

so now what?"

"event","<p>im operating under the thought process ""no news, is good news"". hopefully he will be home from the hospital today. but i wont know anything until someone calls me. still really worried.. but trying to calm down some. we talked a ton yesterday and he sounded good soo we'll see.</p><p>i got to talk to my boyfriend last night <img height=""15"" alt="""" width=""15"" src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/happy.gif"" /> that was great. i hadnt talked to him in a few days... but its been forever since ive heard his voice. hopefully, ill get a call on christmas, id be thrilled!! :excited: but talking to him was great. we talked about when he gets home. and he got that christmas package i sent over so thats great. he said he loves what hes gotten so far (some parts he has to wait til christmas for). hurray! im soo glad he liked it.</p><p>hes pretty sure the present he sent me will make it before i leave. if not its something to come home to. im so excited. **i wonder what it is**</p><p>jens coming over tonight. tomorrow we are getting our hair done, shopping, tons of stuff. we are starting downtown and will probably get to the mall around noon or so shop there and maybe go to a movie. hurray.</p><p>weight wise..making progress. lost what i gained. im back on track.</p><p>my ""friend"" and i ended our friendship. we are no longer speaking or... anything. took each other off myspace... though comments id left her had long been deleted by the time the removal came around. its crazy. im so angry and frustrated, but i dont want her to get hurt either. so then the question becomes- if someone says something about her.. what now? ive been defending her.. trying to make it so she wont get hurt.<br />but shes the one that ended this too.. maybe i shouldnt invest the energy into it?? let her make her own mistakes, afterall, isnt that what she wants?<br />im lost.<br /><br /><img height=""365"" alt="""" width=""360"" border=""1"" src=""http://www.archiveimages.com/Publishing/Prints/POE/Monroe/B-4.jpg"" /></p><center>&nbsp;</center>"

"event","i was soo terrified for that math final today. yikes! so i studied- hard. then went and saw my professor. and it was off to take the final (after making up some work i hadnt finished). i needed at least a 73% to pass the class. so it was all or nothing since a 71% is passing. i was soo scared. but i ended up getting an 80 (which may go to an 83). i am soo excited.
huge sense of relief.

jens coming to visit. hopefully for an overnight this weekend. its a crazy busy weekend though. jen, sposed to go out fri to celebrate the end of finals, xmas party saturday, grandmas sunday. but it was the only time we could fit. oh well."

"event","So, i went into school today planning on taking my math final. however, that is definately NOT how it worked out. i found out im failing the class, by 4%, so i decided to wait and take it tomorrow after i have studied some more and can pass with a higher score. eeeek.

i went christmas shopping today after school. got moms present, and carolyns *hehe carolyn. im finally set*. im excited. i get to see carolyn on sunday. hurrah!! we havent seen each other in an eternity lol.

things with my friend.. are pretty crazy. we are hardly talking. okay we arent talking. i wonder if two people, as opposite as we are.

im going tomorrow night to study for my sociology exam. woo hoo.

my boyfriend should be back, safe and sound very soon. i miss him like crazy. i will be sooo thrilled when he gets home."

"event","its crazy. so much happened yesterday.

our neighbors had a gas leak *sort of*, and the emergency number for maintnance (we live in an apt) was disconnected. i hope we never have an emergency lol.

then tonight, there was a power outage (just a few minutes ago).
i should be sleeping. i have to get up in just a few hours to go to main campus for a meeting with disability services, and to take my math final (this WILL be ugly). 

the only truely horrid thing about finals week.. is that it means i will almost definately forget my AEDs. im so busy, it takes a phonecall from someone to remind me to take them (which is probably the only reason i remembered them today). but hopefully after finals week, ill be all set. the really frustrating thing, is that people i know feel it necessary to point out when i have seizures (ive caught them on many occasions). and its soo frustrating. if people know (since i have such little seizures), should be my decision. who i want to tell should be up to me.. not someone who sees me have one, and feels like broadcasting it. because it only makes me feel more ashamed. and less like anyone else. i mean, like it hasnt been shoved in my face a billion times already with how i should change my major because of them and mom telling me i needed life insurance to ride a bike. and a million other ways. gagh!

i guess i should go, either study or sleep... i need to do something, and make sure i remember my meds tomorrow or im asking for trouble. 

it seems nuts, that saturday is my 5 month anniversary with my boyfriend. its come up so quickly. its insane. i cant wait for him to come home. i miss him soooo much. we're going on a trip, to canada when he comes back ((still looking for people to go with us though)). i cant wait. im not sure how long he will stay for, i guess it depends on how many leave days he has left, and how long he feels like staying with the amount given. im so excited. im worried though. but i dont think that will stop until he gets out of iraq. i miss hearing his voice, but at least ive got the voicemail that i can replay over and over.

im soooo not ready for this test tomorrow. yikes!! hopefully ill be able to study when i get to school ((though chances are ill get online from class and update)).

okay- last, i promise.
i found this online... and i love it, so i thought id post it.

Ummm new-ness since December...
-New place. My room is a cave. Still dunno if I like it or not :P
-New boy. So far so good. He's a bigger movie dork than I am which is a source of endless entertainment.
-New pets. (Well almost) I'm inheriting Corvus' 3 baby snakes. Woot more reptiles! (And continuing my collection of animal types that people get the creeps from)
Umm that's all the major shit I s'pose. I guess I lead a rather dull life :P"

Didn't get the Dr. Marten job. Oh well....
My compy and car died within a week of each other. Compy's power supply, car's alternator. Hell my car died on my way to pick up my newly repaired compy. Kinda ironic really...Specially since both issues have to do with power...Perhaps it's not a coincidence but rather a plot against me. Oh my &gt;&gt;
Pengi cupcakes are a pain in the ass to make but look very cool. Tomorrow's project-an orange mola mola cake for Bradalkins. Mwaha
Apparently I have to go to karaokee on Friday. That'll be...interesting. I'm excited cause it'll be ridiculous but still...interesting :P
The ratties are huge now. And I think I prefer the tank. Less mess. Just needs a better lid and I think I'll rig it for climbing. Though I s'pose I should inquire if Corvus wants it back eventually or not :P

Other than that my compy killed itself, gotta wait a couple days while they order a power supply. Bother. I don't like being compy less...It's like a child being taken away. Or limb. Because I'm that pathetic. Gotta find ways to keep myself busy the next couple of days is all...Bleurgh.

-an hour+ of doing rope, knot tricks (&quot;it's knot juggling, it's knot tying&quot;)&nbsp;-going to the science center (which I've wanted to go there with Ryan for ages-my hypothesis was right-it was more fun. And his explanations for things are so much more interesting than the signs') -wandering aiimlessly through downtown -some HORRIBLE ninja movie (those guys seriously fail at being ninjas...) -several hours of Warhammer with Josh(?)&nbsp;(I've only ever watched...It's actually rather entertaining...Though I think if I were to take it up I'd just spend forever making models and never getting around to actually playing) -a very &quot;intense&quot; game of Set (which I think I need to get myself a deck...Definitely something I could get into/piss people off with :P)
So yes. Sadly having such a wonderfully geeky day yesterday means I will probably be hella bored today. Oh well. I have 39 Steps to look forward to this evening. Maybe I'll call Ryan and see if he's up for making me those pancakes he owes me :P"

Working at the honey place now and pun not intended but it is a pretty sweet job. Access to delicious honey, HELLA money, customers that know what they want, much less down time. I love it. With the exception of 5 days I've made 150 bucks (which is the cut off sadly :P)&nbsp;4 of those were *only* in the 130 realm and one was 200. Eeeeehehehe Sadly though that'll probably slow down by a lot very soon...
Plus the honey job has me in with the farmers-free fruit and veggies all the time-woooot!
Really I'm just working and hanging out. I've run into a ton of SCCC video folk in the last week or so. In the span of two days i ran into Omar, Mystic and Craig. Basically some of my favorite people. Heard some gossip and apparently they all really miss me/were sad when I didn't return. Today though I ran into Kate (who's alright) as well as my two least favorite people-Micahel and Bridgette. I ran away and watched from afar. They were filming and seemed like most of it was Michael and Bridgette at each others throats. Man I do NOT miss those guys haha
Let's see...
Oh, 21 now...Brad still hasn't taken me karaoking...Granted it's been less than a week but still :P
Hmm...Other things? 
My hat and jacket &quot;collection&quot; is now massive. As well as my DVD collection-I've run out of shelf room &gt;&lt;
OH! And probably Friday I'm getting a couple rats from Corvus. I dunno what I'm gonna name them yet. Considering Reginald and Bertie. Or the corisponding last names :P
And ummm....umm...I guess that's it."

Just bought Pushing Daisies season 2 and Flight of the Conchords season 2. No wonder I never have money &gt;&lt; But after cat sitting and other stuffs it'll even out.

Got a ticket for a screening of Ponyo on Monday. Fuck yeah. The first person I thought of was Brad to join me so he's probably joining. Woooot
Note to self: bring swimming attire on the next boating trip. Swimming in Lake Washinton was way too much fun. Would've been better had my shorts not been dragging me down though. And I love how I was able to out-swim Ryan, Robyn and Brian. (In heavy shorts mind you haha)
Apparently my balance isn't as bad as it used to be. I was able to take a step on a slack line. (Granted I would NOT let go of Luke's hand but that's beside the point :P) Besides rather painful dismounts/falls it was pretty fun. I might just have to try it again. 
I've been working since Monday. I'm not used to having to work Mondays. And I work Sunday (least it's not at the market...) Basically Saturday is my only day off. Dunno how I'll spend it yet :P Maybe I can talk Brad into more boating!
Apparently my dad is going to Alaska for 2.5 weeks (at least/for the time being) Just so happens that that's when Olivia leaves. And my uncle comes up to visit. Oh dear. My mother is gonna force me into spending time with her and my uncle. *shudder*

But those are expensive. So I'm gonna collect squishy stuff off freecycle and craigslist and already have fabric. And color that Value Village had the most of-cow print. Fuck yes.
I have a new celly as well seeing as Ziggy commited cellicide recently. &quot;Maroon&quot;&nbsp;LG EnV2. Don't know which David Bowie ego I'll name it after though. Maybe Dave Jay. Even though no one ever remembers that one...
I getta go concerting tomorrow thanks to Mara. Decemeberists and Andrew Bird. Oh man.
I also getta go ghost hunting on Saturday. The group is heading to Puyallup with all the equipment to a cemetary that &quot;has had recent activity&quot; Basically it sounds dorkily wonderful.
Apparently my father cut 3/4&quot; off the tip of his pinky finger today. Oh my.
There's an agent at the market with the most adorable kitten. Aslan (or however you spell the name of the lion in Narnia...) 6 weeks old (first met it last week)&nbsp;I must say that will be the most well adjusted cat ever-it's basically passed from market person to market person all day.

I now have at least 4 days at the market now (2 for my mother, 2 for Kathy (and lately she's been giving me days on weekends))&nbsp;I'm sure the extra time there will make me even more crazy but whatever...I like kinda having money
Apparently I'm a total nerd about having a hamster. I bought a second cage and a bunch of tubes at Rotary. And instead of just switching Ava over to the new cage I combined thte two to make a super cage. And I still don't think it's done. Wow, I'm worse than Ryan :P
Since Corvus is spending more time in Port Townsand he's decided he wants to have weekly weekend fests over there. I'm excited. Went last weekend (which it was just me and Brad going up-I don't think I've spent one on one time with Brad before and I have to say what a ridiculous guy haha) and attempted to go crabbing. We of course didn't get anything but it was still really fun.
Lynn and I hashed out a plot outline for the market zombie movie. It's going to be awesome. She also invited me to the monthly Ghostbusters club she's started going to. Basically a bunch of people get together and go to potentially &quot;haunted&quot; places with the corresponding equipment and everything. Fuck yeah.
I'm kinda liking my current situation. I have an income of sorts and a rather excellent social life. Shame it'll all disappear in the fall when the market goes back to being a ghost town but whatever."

It climbs around it's cage and is constantly on it's hind legs. I put some toilet paper tubes in there and it immediatly squeezed into the one of the upper deck thing of it's cage. It started to roll, fell off the deck in the tube then crawled out the other end. Plus it's rather cuddly which is an excellent bonus. The cage is definitely going to need some improving though-perhaps I will get the geek boys to help me with that :P And Ryan has decided we need to set up a &quot;hamster date&quot;&nbsp;for Ava and Pip haha
The baking bit of the now two cakes is complete. Decorating tomorrow at my parents'. Assembly of the virus at Brad's (still don't know what I'm gonna put in the body to make it stable...Hmm.)
Tomorrow is going to be a long day. Once I get back to the Seattle side though it will be aweosme. Specially after seeing Corvus' gift for Ryan-18'x5' slip and slide. Fuck yes. Plus the usual awesome-ness that occurs at mad scientist parties XD

I think I spent too much time with snakes today. But I like them. So it's all good.
And apparently I'm going Rocky Horror-ing this weekend. Excellent. It's been a while. I'll have to track down my various costume pieces :P
I hate storyboards. Blech.
Stupid stickers making the box all sticky :(
Time to storyboard some more *sigh*"

Hopefully that'll help put me back on his good side.
Now all I have to do is the storyboard.
And all the work I put off doing so I could work on the model &gt;&lt;
I've been singing way too much Dr. Horrible and Repo! lately. I'm sure people in my class who haven't seen either know all the songs by now haha

"event","I've been watching a lot lately. And frankly I'm jealous. <em>Dr. Horrible, Repo!, Dhoom: 2</em>.... It's all too good!<br />I've also been trying to watch more movies again (clearly)&nbsp;I was having withdrawls before. So I went and saw <em>Coraline</em> in 3D. Pretty fucking cool. I don't particularly care for how they changed the story and especially not the new character but visually it's fucking amazing. Also went to a noir film double feature-<em>Chicago Deadline</em> and <em>Johnny Stool Pidgeon</em>. Note to self:watch more noir films. Also started watching <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>. What a great show. Sadly however I am horribly behind on <em>LOST</em> and the NBC Thursday line-up. Oh and there's <em>Dollhouse</em>-gotta say I wasn't terribly impressed with the first episode. Hopefully it'll improve.<br />Let's see...Other random going ons...<br />I finally got to meet Lynn's rat collection. Holy shit. 100+ rats. REAL rats. It's crazy.<br />I've been spending almost too much time with Corvus. Don't get me wrong, I love the kid to death, but it's kinda annoying when people <em>assume</em> we're dating. Which we aren't. So nyeh.<br />What else...The group project turned out alright. Although John misspelled my name in the gorram credits!! *beats John-Kid with club* The second shooting day was so much better than the first with the absense of Mark. <br />Hmm... Sal still hates me. It's sad. <br />I'm working on a 3D model of the set we're building. Or rather re-doing. Cause no one gave me the gorram plans the first time around. Hmph. <br />I've been spending a lot of time building stuff lately. A lot of helping build the set for the class project and helping Corvus and Brad with their random projects. I have to say it's a lot of fun. Power tools are so much fun to use. And it's so satisfying when you've accomplished something. I wish I had realized this before. <br />I really want a turtle. There are little semi-aquatic ones at Pet Co. that are only 20 bucks and Corvus has a tank he can give me. Now just as soon as I have 20 bucks U.U <br />And I need to do laundry. Booo.<br />"

"event","So the part driving me insane: filming Saturday. Ugh. It was awful. Mark was such a controlling ass. He took over everyone's jobs at least once. He made us look horrible in front of the actors (mostly by picking fights and arguing). He COMPLETELY changed the script while we were shooting so it ended up being what Sal absolutely does NOT want (yay, more to add to the reshoot *shudder*) He added a new scene that I didn't set up the room for that totally fucks with my design scheme (which I'm going to get docked on....) Ugh...<br />But luckily yesterday I was able to save my sanity at the last moment-I called Corvus to see if he could help me with a floor layout thing we're supposed to do for class (I just assumed he's now how to do that and luckily that's what he used to do for fun haha) Once that was good enough we ended up just hanging out for a while which included delicious bacon, purchasing a fire-bellied toad, creating a steam punk terrarium that will eventually house a scorpion...colony (?), failing at making stir-fry and watching <em>Repo! The Genetic Opera</em> (which I need to buy/download A.S.A.P. because it's AMAZING) Basically I got to do something FUN. It was good.<br />And now for some food and homework. Mmm-mmm food.<br />"

Tonight I have to finish designing a cigarette box, edit 3 assignments on my out of date software (it's a full version behind-I couldn't find the current version...) which'll be a good hour each at least, continue reading one of the...4 textbooks I have yet to read, work on that gorram Kramer Versus Kramer production design analysis, read 2 scripts... I'm sure there's more but I can't remember.
And that's just to do TONIGHT.
Tomorrow I have to go to editing class *shudder*, come back home, load all the equipment back in my car, go and pick people up, drive to Port Orchard and spend the rest of the day in Port Orchard watching my group FAIL at their jobs. I will then stay the night over there seeing as we are shooting at 7 A.M. the following morning. And oh yeah, one of our actors (Goddamn John Fantasia)&nbsp;bailed on us last night. So we currently don't have a father for our movie. At least it's the producer's problem and not mine (though it's still uber annoying)
So like I said, I need an adventure-something FUN. Guess that's what spring break is for...Several months from now..."

Tonight: come up with another documentary idea, transcribe an interview, watch part of Days of Heaven and write 1.5-2 pages about the production design, try to remember part of The King of Comedy and do likewise, come up with a design breakdown for the group project as well as title designs...
Tomorrow: spend before class and lunch editing (probably go to school early...) which I'm already behind on, try and figure out rehearsal days with Phil and Kate, probably figure out rehearsal days for the scenes I'm acting in, sneak out of class 15 minutes early so I can catch the 3 whatever ferry and immediately go from the ferry to babysit until 11:30...
Thursday: catch the gorram 7:05 ferry, after class finish editing...
And any &quot;free time&quot; (bus rides, ferry rides, breaks, etc.) will be spent reading textbooks and attempting to memorize scripts.
Ou boy.
And Mark wanted me to draw him a fucking storyboard by Thursday. At that point I snapped (we've had to put up with so much shit from Mark...Especially today...) and just said &quot;Fuck you Mark, draw your own fucking storyboard.&quot; He avoided me the rest of today. Ha!
I got illustrator for the class project. Figured I would just cause no one else is even willing to do it. Which also means I may very well be hopped up on pain killers for the duration of the semester cause of my gorram hand. Super. Oh well, better than dolly grip (*snicker* Poor John-Kid...)
During the group meeting with Sal today I was slightly out of it/off in my own world and when I didn't give him a sufficient answer right away Sal asked me if I did drugs (followed by instructions to wait until after I'm out of the program haha)&nbsp;That makes him the...third teacher to outright ask me that haha I swear, no drugs! Just a little...not in the real world :P That was then followed by Sal making another &quot;situation&quot; where Kyle dies-that's 3 in the last week. Well 3 deaths, 4 injuries for Kyle suggested by Sal. That guy is just...morbid haha
It's a quarter past 9 and I'm ready to crash. Aw shit."

I also get to look forward to at *least*&nbsp;3 days of driving to Port Orchard in the next couple of weeks...
Today was actually rather entertaining when Mark was completely out of the picture (which he wasn't even there even though he should have been since he's the gorram DIRECTOR) We're probably gonna talk to Sal tomorrow and see if we can appoint Kyle as director. Then we might actually know what we're doing. Mark also called each of us individually to &quot;put us on the same page&quot; We each got a different story. Ugh. That guy just needs to go away... Yeah, he's entertaining and an okay guy but he's a fucking stubborn dumbass haha And related to that I didn't know Alisa could talk so fast...Or include the word &quot;like&quot; so many times in a single rant haha Oh and apparently neither John or Kyle can navigate either...We got so fucking lost...But it was entertaining anyway (especially the several times me and Kyle made John talk to Alisa on the phone to tell her we were lost-that kid is so damn awkward!)
Wow my mind is extra jumpy.
I want House to start!
And I'm gonna have to avoid my Losties on Thursday (coincidently John and Kyle...Who are in my group...This'll be difficult)&nbsp;cause I'm gonna have to miss the premier *sobs*&nbsp;But at least I'll be getting money which is very useful.
Fuck, I need to figure out what I need to do and by when...Let's see...Interview and documentary ideas by Wednesday....That shit load of editing shit by Friday.... Something about analysising some scenes by Thursday....Memorize some lines ASAP....Read some textbooks ASAP.... Ugh....
But other than all that shit I still like being over here and all that goodness haha Though I still say my bedroom walls are too bare. And I really wanna build a hat/coat rack haha

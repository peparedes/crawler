"event","Yes well...today is a lovely day. I came over to Claire's house at 1:00 and then hope and courtney the lovelys came over as well. We watched the look for less...GREAT SHOW and layed out by the pool. Courtney is going to be a great water polo player. I love it, lol. Yes, and then we decided to go shopping at Woodland mall for homecoming accessories. I'm so excited for homecoming! I want to get a date but, i don' want to have to ask anybody! So, if you're hot and available, give me a call. I already have my dress but, no, i don't have a date. It's not like, life or death or anything but, it would feel nice to be asked. Yes, so abbey, I will get the guest pass that you asked for. I want to meet all of those geneva people! That would be the bomb diggity! I just told courtney not to be scared but, she is. Yes, she is a crazy person. Um...what else happened? i do'nt know but, i found a great band that i am in love with. They are called....THE KILLERS. I love them so much. They're like, a british techno band. They're funny but, they're music is rocking. I love them. OMG i went to the boys' soccer game yesterday and there is am AMAZINGLY hot guy from West Michigan Christian...yes, you know who it is, amanda and other people. wow, i want to like, talk to him like, face to face and then hook up. That would be sweet. Ok, well...good bye all of my lovelies! I am off to go shopping! 
       Kristen, the bomb diggity

 P.S. PAPARAZZI is a grand movie but it's very predictable...but I like it a lot!

"event","I am going to share with all of you one of my most secret fantasies. I have never told anyone before. I want to be a model. I think that would be awesome! Designer Clothes, Hot men, Everyone looking at you and....FAME! Everyone knows you're beautiful and finally, you can believe them without being arrogant. I was watching a thing on models and they are all so beautiful and thin. It makes me mad and makes me sad at the same time. I know I won't be one but, I would love it and it would be tons of fun. I remember when claire said I could be a model and I said,"" no i couldn't are you kidding me?"" but secretly in my head, I was happy that someone would even say something like that about me. I know it's crazy and I know that it won't ever happen but, I can always dream! And be jealous of the beautiful skinny ladies who we all secretly want to be...me included. So, I am ending my sharing of a secret with all of you. My secret wish of being beautiful, famous and have people want to be me. I'll go back to watching Tyra Banks and those foreign girls walk the catwalk.

           ~ Love Kristen...I'm working on my autograph"

"event","Wow, I must say, i hate live journals. They are dumb. If I wanted someone to know what i do everyday, i'd call them and tell them. I don't even know why i'm writing in this right now. They start so many fights and dumb stuff. Also, i am mad at the world. yeah, that's been happening a lot lately. I don't really like to do anything except sit around my pool and tan. Dumb basketball ruins my day. Someone is going to be offended by that i know but, oh well. I don't really like playing sports in the summer but i have to so i can make the teams next year. That makes me really mad. Also, the library didn't have any of the books that i wanted to check out so i was mad again, also, i have to clean so much because of my brother's graduation party. Oh well.. that's fine i guess. Wow, yeah, I do'nt even really like to do much with my friends. I don't really have that many friends. Well, close friends anyway. I don't know, every day, the number seems to drop one more. Oh well...i don't care. I just need a pool, a suit and some sun to make me happy. I thkn i need to see a therapist or something. I need to see a chiropractor. lol, yeah, my back is killing me. ok I'm going to shop. Or maybe play my bass. Who knows. But i'm rockin. Ok bye."

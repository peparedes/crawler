"event","Most of you will know the sad story of how Sophie Lancaster and her boyfriend were beaten up in Bacup because of their appearance - Sophie died as a result of her injuries and her boyfriend will never fully recover from his injuries. The offenders were caught and imprisoned but their sentences seem light in comparison to what they did and the fact that they try to appeal against their sentences shows that they have no remorse.

If you're not familiar, you can read about it here -

The Sophie Lancaster Foundation was set up to try and combat prejudices against, what is currently not illegal - prejudice based on individual's lifestyle choice - ie goth, metaller, emo whatever.

Stamp
Out
Prejudice,
Hatred &
Intolerance
Everywhere

I know, many of you like me will have put up with a lifetime of verbal abuse from ignorant strangers, some of you may have been unfortunate enough to have been physically abused. Please help give this issue issue more focus and vote for the Sophie Lancaster Foundation to get funding for it's good work.

Saturday, Woke late, met up with Tink, Kristine, Doktor Joy, Sharna and Mark in Camden. Bought some Tango from Superdrug and went to firework display at Alexandra Palace. Lost Sharna and Doktor Joy. The fireworks were amazing! Went home, drank wine, went to buy more wine, aparently kicked people's arses at Singstar, woke up around 11am on the sofa on Sunday morn. Went to the West end to shop with Ross, Mark, Lisa and Steveo and overdraft allowance, bought Maximo Park album for one of my brother's birthdays (15 yrs on Nox 17th) Spongebob Square Pants game for my PS2 and the Mighty Boosh. Had a yummy salad in Pizza Express. Watched Taxi.

I'm still waiting to cook my porridge-120 secs in the microwave is all I need. Maybe I should use boiled water instead....
Went to see Corpse Bride last night anyhow with Greg (who's just bought a motorbike, very nice it is too) and Ross. Emily, the corpse bride has the kind of look I'd always dreamt about if I got married-long blue hair! I'm still gonna cut mine though.
Does anyone know if the firework display at the Ally Pally is free of not?

We went to their hotel as every pub in London was so packed as you'd expect. Think they don't hate me! Ross's dad bought us pints and just before we parted at 1am, Ross's dad showed us a couple of magic tricks (he's a member of the magic circle!). We then went on th the Rock night at the Mean Fidler where we got in for free thanks to my mate David who was dressed up as a priest for the night and giving confessions and met up with Dean back from Wolvo days. We bought some treats to take home with us and didn't get to sleep until 7am. We also stayed in bed until 7am the next day. Went to Pizza Express as Ross has been hankering to go there for ages and then we tried to catch the Corpse Bride but missed it and saw Domino instead as we didn't want to go home yet. What a pile of poo that was! Like what did we expect. Might go to White Heat thingy at Tatty Bogle tonight-it's Halloween and Comanechi are playing! Mark-if you want to come make sure you've signed up to their membership thing-won't stay too late though.

The most amazing thing is that it took me over an hour to eat 2 slices of toast this morning-longer with the first slice, then took a break and ate the 2nd slice with the aid of cutlery. I was planning on losing a bit of weight anyway so maybe this is a good thing. It's such a chore to eat!
Oh, tomorrow, Jaemi's band; Ophelia Torah are playing at the Colour Bar on Inverness Street in Camden and it's free! Everyone should come!

"event","Still can't run but I could last night after a few pints. Hmmm. I went to see my friends band - Veto Silver, they're kind of a bit like Sheep on Drugs sometimes and sometimes Apoptygma Bezerk. Then I really wanted to wee when Ross and I got to Camden to I we went to McDonalds (Oh dear, haven't for a long time, please remind me why we're not meant to go in there) and Ross bought some fries so that I could use their facilities guilt - free but there was a tramp in there or someone for a long time so after all that I had to hold until I got home. 
I'm very tired. Ross has gone to see his mate Lard in Watford. I might go home and try to buy some food with my chequebook. It shouldn't get cashed till payday? I only have half a lettuce, a tin of pilchards, wholewheat spaghetti and rice and 6 eggs, and some carrots and some houmous which should have been eaten by the 19th. I want pizza. I haven't had pizza for a while, but then my tummy is sticking out from my lack of running still since Saturday so I probably shouldn't. Maybe I'll practice MV songs. Theyr're really easy.
Fidel texted me last night. He wants to meet up later in the week. Says there is a lot to discuss. I thought it was over. I'm really not sure if I want to be involved with the Bone with all this childish crap....."

His knee hurts but I have ouchies on the inside and I can't run and I have to roll over and push myself up when I've been lying down. It hurts to sneeze and cough. It's kind of like where a hernia is but there's nothing sticking out (I saw a fat lady on telly with one once). Just internal pain......"

"event","So I missed the biggest party of all time because the celebrations fell on the same date as one of my brotehr's birthdays. He was 17 on Saturday. I felt sorry for him because no one else got him a card or a present, didn't do anything special for him. My dad took him to TK Maxx to buy him a No Fear t-shirt on the day and my mum bought him a cake but that was it. I told him he should come visit me before his weekends are swallowed by his part-time job. Poor kid, A-levels and then 16 hours at Marks and Spencer a week. Sucky. I was pretty bored and tired all weekend but then I needed to save money anyway as not much left on my overdraft after buying 3 Reading tickets (this year's and 2 for next year for Ross and I)
I still have 2 and a half weeks holiday left to take and considering how much I hate the cold, I should take them sooner rather than later. I usually sleep when I take days off-any better ideas?"

Details Kick It Over 
HORDES

+ The View
+ Formula Bone 

Please be upstanding and welcome Kick It Over, our newest promoters. They'll be looking after the third Wednesday of the month,starting September, but we thought we'd let them get warmed up and bust some moves in August. 

Hordes fill the headline slot like '80s inspired neo-psychedelic revivalists mixing up The Cure, Psychedelic Furs and Syd Barrett. Winners of the Diesel Music Awards. We also hear Autolux and The Dandy Warhols, but from a distance, filtered through foliage. 

The View provide main support, dealing in Neil Young and Led Zeppelin slanted songs coupled with heavy bass and booty shaking grooves.

All this is backed by the incomparable [really, we've tried] Formula Bone. It's poppy lo-fi new wavish punk delivered with fire in the heart. Like The Monkees meeting The Ramones uptown after six Red Stripes and then some. But all you need to know is that they're enormous, inventive fun"

"event","So went to see NIN at Brixton Academy last night but I was totally pissed off that Trent Reznor's Stretch Armstrong appearance wasn't amusing me all night. Jaemi told me that he and Emma had decided that it wasn't a good idea for me to play in their band as I was too dedicated to Formula Bone. I was only meant to be filling in until they found someone but then Emma wanted me in the band but knew about Formula Bone. This was cool before. They haven't found a replacement. I've spent hours learning their music and gone to rehearsals. Why did Jaemi have to tell me on the day of NIN? Initially I said it was ok but I began to get more and more pissed off as the day progressed. This pissed me off so much, this was a really expensive gig for me since I bought Jaemi's ticket for him for his birthday and Sean's, just because he wanted to come too. I don't feel like speaking to him for a while, even though I know he's homeless (which is really his fault) and he's staying at mine.
Grrr.
Still, Pirate party tonight at the Underworld and Gig tomorrow at the New Cross Inn and then Sean's Dad's birthday on Friday and Godiva Festival on Saturday (anyone coming?) I must try and contact Lindaaaaaghhhhh. Sean's moving in on Sunday. Scary."

Been quite busy, Went to see Sean as he'd got me ticket to see Micah P. Hinson, strange baby faced skater guy with the wisdom and voice of almost Johnny Cash, a bit like Silver Jews style but not as tongue in cheek. He played with a band called Vetever and someone in this band's band befor Micah. All good. Saw Dinosaur Jr last week at the Forum, Lou Barlow was standing behind us! I kept my cool though. Saw Bobby Gillespie at the bar, he smiles in real life. Got very drunk after at the Underworld and then I cried when I got home. I used the lack of soup in my noodles as an excuse. 
I'm playing bass for Jaemi and Emma's band (Emma used to be in Twist) but I'm nervous about tonight. I think I need my distortion / overdrive peddle for courage. If Jaemi's nicked mu battery though, I'm gonna kick him....."

I love shredded wheat.
Saw at a newspaper sign for Ham and High - ""Highgate cemetery faces grave crisis""
Oh yeah, seen Sean and me in the latest Coco-Cola ad walking away from the camera in an underpass. I've fot a pink top and Sean's got a bag over his shoulder. The elusive man himself is aparently coming to visit me tomorrow for the weekend. I haven't seen my boyfriend for 7 weeks. It's a long time and I was starting to feel single again....."

I knew the orthodontist assistant from when I used to work in Pizza Hut about 8 or 9 years ago-she's the smiliest person I've ever met. The braces are gonna cost a lot of money but atleast they'll split the costs over installments. 
Still practicing the new songs. I keep on playing the ones I can already play though-tut,tut. We're meant to be having a launch party in about a month so I've decided to maker some comic books for the promo packs. Gotta have these done by Tuesday though.
I watched make me a supermodel for the first time last night as I can't get Channel 5 where I live, only to see my mate get dropped from it. She's far more stunning than the rest anyway and I'm not being biased.

Afterwards I went to White Heat and they played 3 Sonic Youth songs, 1 Sebadoh and 1 Pavement song amongst others-I was in heaven and also very drunk. I was very naughty and didn't get to bed until 5am thinking I'd be fine to get up in a couple of hours. I woke at 10:30am. Work were cool about it and I took the morning off as holiday.

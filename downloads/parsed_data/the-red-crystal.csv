Their ship is pretty cool (I saw it the other day while walking to work) although it looks fucked up badly.

For the first time, there's not much I can do except earn munny. Maybe I need to get stronger? 




....Nahhhhhhhhh!"

URGHHHHHHHHHHH After that <i>extremely</i> awkward situation last night where I found out that Riku likes Selphie (yes, I mean ""like like"") I had to go sleep on the fucking couch. THE SOFA, MAN!!!!!



I do not like the sofa.


But yeah, when I woke up this morning I had what is commonly referred to as a bitchin' headache. Know why? THE CLASS-A DUMBASS (not me, riku) CAME UP AND PUNCHED BOTH OF MY EYES IN HIS FUCKING SLEEP. 

Now I look like a racoon. Damnzzzz. And the dumbass to whom I referred to earlier, Riku, is snoring on the floor right beside me. Because, after punching me out last night, the little fucker couldn't make it back to my bed to rest his woozy little head on MY PILLOW!!

I guess it wouldn't be to bad If I caused him some pain where it hurts the most. I've got two black eyes!"

I don't believe him, though. I know that dude took Kairi and Namine. He's just got this evil look in his eyes, it's just......emotionless. Not evil, persay. It's just as if there is nothing there. He looks like the type of guy that could take a sweet chick like Kairi and say he didn't do it.

I was sick, though, when we fought. That's the only reason why he beat me."

"event","I,I, I can't find Kairi anywhere or that girl Namine

I was at work and delivering papers when I saw Selphie on that stupid sunset hill, crying
I asked her what was wrong and she said Kairi and Namine were gone. I asked her Gone where? and she just cried even harder repeating that she didn't know. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know--- I asked her what happened and she cried even harder if that's possible

I started shaking her, I was really worried and then she said that someone took them, someone took Kairi

I don't know what to do, I told her not to go see that guy on sunset hill and she just laughed and said I was jealous but I swear to god I did not write that letter, I did did did did not write that letter and I don't know where Kairi is or what happened to her or what even happened to namine"

"event","So, I got that post office part time job yesterday. And today was my first day on the job. I'm tirrrrrrrred. I had to climb all around Twilight Town and deliver those letters. Tee Hee, Kairi got a letter covered in hearts! There was no return address however, otherwise tonight I would be egging some houses....lol. Anyway, for my job, I have to climb around Twilight Town with all it's terraces, railways, lots of high places to get the mail to the weird places it needs to be delivered. So, I was climbing over the railroad tracks to get the trainstation, when the gust of wind comes out of nowhere and I fall flat on my face! When I got up, I saw this dude in a black coat standing on top of the clock tower! What the hell's with that?


Stupid Wind. Making me see stupid things *grumble grumble*"

I hate school. It's so boring, man, All I want to do is play struggle and hang out around the town. My mom won't get off my back about a part time job, though. It's like everyone in Twilight Town is trying to make me more and more responsible. Well, here's what I say to them: No! Let me stay in my room playing simulated struggle!

But, I guess I'll get that mail delivery job -.-;;;

I really don't want it. But, a guy's got to earn a living."

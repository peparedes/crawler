Pat Field's is the godmother to Michele's son. We spent way too much time at the store.. and Michele get's 50% off.. she bought some gold TRIPP jeans, a gold belt, a big tacky black/gold leapord bag.. then we went to Trash and Vaudeville where I bought some shoes.. then she took us over to Jo Jo Americo's apartment so he could show us his shoe collection.

http://www.observer.com/2008/arts-culture/hbos-bored-death-sounds-pretty-exciting
Hey, we think HBO might be getting back on track! Our colleague at the Culture Czar recommends True Blood, the new show from Alan Ball, but we're actually more psyched about Bored to Death. We were thrilled about the prospects of the series just from hearing the premise: a struggling writer with a slight drinking problem, fresh off a break-up, decides to become a private eye. When Jason Schwartzman signed on for the lead role, our interest was immediately piqued. Schwartzman is perfect casting for a lovelorn writer-nebbishy and yet capable of being an everyman. Plus, we flat-out love him."

Saturday night, hundreds of Pandas converged on Bedford Avenue in route from Union Square, as part of a planned ""street party of the summer"". Organizers Pandamonium, who are a self-described ""costumed, roving, street party, apocalyptic, dance, rock, battle"" announced the event details on their site yesterday morning, saying:

    Today is the day! Pandamonium 8:30pm Union Square South.

    Bring your friends, a boombox, your panda outfit and lets get down!

    see you there!

    -the panda posse

So, dressed in Panda suits and armed with music they took the L from Union Square to Bedford Avenue. As we all know however, the NYPD doesn't really care for costumed, roving, street parties, apocalyptic, dance, rock, battles, so they set up a strong presence around N. 6th and met the Panda Parade with a bit of resistance. Lola Wakefield from Stuff Hipster's Don't Like wrote in this morning with a great first hand account of the insanity, including a story on how that very boom box met it's fate. Here's that:

    The last straw for the police was when a really good song came on a boom box that this guy was holding on his shoulder a few feet away from me. The cops must have known that something sinister was taking place because there were at least 10 people dancing to the music. Then a cop grabbed the guy with the boom box by the back of his arm and yanked him into the street, pushing him to the ground and making him loose grip of the stereo. Now, I know that dancing is illegal and also a sin, but I think there was excessive force used in this situation. The stereo fell, batteries flying everywhere, and when a few of his friends picked it up, a woman cop angrily lunged for the boom box and tried to further dismantle it!

She also found this video on youtube (by froozalicious) featuring some NYPD-famous smackdowns. I'm sure their will be plenty more of these suckers popping up over the next two days, so keep your eyes out, and hide your boom boxes. As with all NYC happenings, Gothamist has the story and a few more pictures of the Pandamonium.

Oh, and that picture above...man, how would you like spending the night in the tombs wearing a Panda suit?! Something tells me they don't serve Bamboo..."

The gays downstairs put huge signs all over it saying do not open. Huge Rat. Poison. Well this morning as I was going to work I noticed the lid was off and the rat was gone. Greg downstairs called me and asked about it.. he said my roommate was hanging on the patio til 5 in the morning with a friend.. so it must have been them. So Greg went upstairs and was slamming on the door until my roommate opened it. My roommate said the lid was on there this morning and he would have never touched it.. I believe him.. so could a rat push the lid off of a metal trashcan? If so we have a crazed drugged up rat wandering around."

I don't know what's more upsetting? The fact that the Real World is entering its 21st season or that it has chosen Brooklyn as its next location. 21 fucking seasons?! I can't believe they are still able to find fools who want to get drunk and vomit on basic cable television.

Shooting for Real World 21 begins this summer in Brooklyn. The show's co-creator sent Gothamist this release, ""The Brooklyn season, like the Hollywood season, will focus on what people loved about 'The Real World' when it launched in 1992 - genuine people, meaningful conflict and powerful stories."" Um...didn't the Hollywood season feature a bunch of skanks who got drunk and fucked each other? Really meaningful and powerful.

It's not know what part of Brooklyn the producers have chosen to terrorize, but some think it's going to be Williamsburg. Personally, I they should put that shit in East New York or Coney Island. Watching the locals beat the hell out of these wannabe whores will make it the best season ever."

"event","A friend of mine had listed under music on his myspace page: ice cream truck

One time, I was walking down S 1st St at night, only to run across an open garage containing at least 40 ICE CREAM TRUCKS! It was very bizarre. I was waiting for 40 evil clowns to run out. 

We didn't have ice cream trucks back in Atlanta like they have here.

There's one right outside my window right now playing that damn song again. It's really loud. The illegal/legal? immigrants working across the street are lined up."

"event","I decided to make this journal, to write about my intimate expiriences with my boyfriend.
We've been dating for a year now...we've had our ups <b>and</b> plenty of downs.
I love him with all of my heart and more than every breath I take.

I guess you could say this is a journal about my sex life- which is awesome.
You are all jealous ;)


This is mostly a Private Journal...if you want me take make you a friend, you'll have to let me think about it...this is the most intimate details of my life and my boyfriends.

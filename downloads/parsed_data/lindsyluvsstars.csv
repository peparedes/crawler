"event","I have to write this eulogy for my grandmother's funeral on Wednesday morning. My cousins have complied memories that I am supposed to use in at least a five minute speech about a woman who absolutely molded so many pieces of my life. 
Words keep swirling around in my head but the second my pen touches paper, or I read these delicate memories, by chest clinches up and my throat goes numb. My eyes absolutely loose focus- 
I wasn't ready to say goodbye. I was absolutely not ready for her to go. There were so many things we were still supposed to do. I barely scratched the surface as far as her knowledge was concerned. I still have a million questions. I still want a million hugs. 
My heart is broken. Really, really broken. 
This is agonizing- 
if you're the praying sort, say one, or two, or three."

Christmas update:
Appologies to the people I said I wanted to see and haven't.  The season isn't over yet, so hopefully I'll redeem myself. 
I spent Christmas day in the hospital watching my grandmother take her last breath.
The very next day I had to tell my mother that my Dad didn't want her at the funeral. (It is going to be a VERY small and intimate affair, and unfortunately my mother is an ex-wife and it would make things very awkward for my Dad and his new wife. My Dad is grieving the death of his mother and I chose to not argue and respect his wishes.) Needless to say Mom freaked out and took a little (a lot) of the anger out on me. *Cue more emotions that I wasn't ready for* So I decided after all of the chaos that I needed an AA meeting pretty badly. I go to said AA meeting a shed some tears only to find that my car has been towed because someone decided to pull out the parking sign that politely instructed me to not park there. It was a freak thing. Legal space and everything... so I paid $181.34 to get my car out of some skanky towing yard around midnight last night. To add insult to injury, I only had $60.00 in my bank account and had to use the money that my dead grandmother gave me for Christmas a few days before she died to get my fucking car out. 

Christmas was a bust. 
I'm ready for the breath of fresh air that New Years brings. 

I got a digital camera (I think I'm the only person who didn't have one) and a Wii for Christmas. The camera I requested but the Wii was a complete surprise. And a Wii FIT! I'm super excited to try it!

I can't wait for better days. 
And I'm really trying to hold it together. 

Also, the funeral is on Wednesday. As I said, it is very small and informal. I am the oldest of eight cousins and instead of a service or traditional eulogy all of the kids are writing down 8-10 fun memories of my grandmother. And I will stand there next to her coffin and read them all.  I was honored to be asked, but my primary concern is not breaking down infront of everyone. My grandmother and I were really close. She taught me to craft and sculpt and use a kiln. She taught me to sew and was the toughest lady I have ever known.  This is going to be one of the most difficult things I walk through, I'll make it though."

To genuinely be uncomfortable with comfortability.

Things are going great! But I've become irritable and anxious to the point of biting my nails again.  

I am keeping a keen eye on myself. Because I don't want to fuck all of this good stuff up. But deep in my bowels I want to. The demons not dead and I want to wreck this onslaught of good things in my life. How can this be so? I think I might be a lunatic.

Mending hearts and felt purses and journaling.
Mending is wishful thinking but the checkbook covers I've been pounding out have been theraputic.  

You know, I'm doing the best I can.  Hopefully sooner than later, this will feel like a bad dream I had once.  And when I finally settle in, you'll come trampsing out of the shadows.

"event","So Ive come to realize that not drinking every night leads to not being able to sleep.  Which is sort of sad that I had once been to the point of drinking enough to pass out, not even for entertainment sake, just sleep sake.

I think I finally fell asleep around five in the morning last night. I have this new method that Im working the kinks out of...it involves focusing on the insides of my eye lids and letting the darkness take me somewhere but this causes one of two things..

1.I get this weird rollercoaster feeling.  I imagine flowing in and out of the twisty parts of my brain- but eventually I start going too fast and I get nauseous and I cant stop the feeling unless I open my eyes- which obviously defeats the purpose. Or

2.Upon examining the insides of my eyelids I see these faces, some angry, some sad, ALL vivid.  Like TOO vivid.  Whats most disturbing is that these faces are completely unfamiliar to me and sometimes come with messages.  Like CLEAR STATEMENTS as if someone whispered them in my ear.  The most recent being an angry older man, frowning saying, ""Find her, you have to find her..."" and a younger girl saying, ""Tell them I didn't mean it, I'm so sorry. So sorry.""  I have yet to figure out what the hell all of this means but its been happening for some time now. So my subconscious is either very imaginative or I'm psychic and dead people are coming to me when I have my eyes closed and are sending me messages?? wtf??

Either way, I dont sleep very well. And I had to wake up at eight this morning and not falling asleep until around five was not okay. 

Side note: my uterus is diligently trying to burst out of my abdomen. Or systematically kill me from the inside. 

Ugh."

Fallcore was a bust.  Mostly Rex making me drink gin and tonics and gin and tonics and gin and tonics.  You would think that booze would make me feel more socially acceptable and rid me of inhibitions.  But it does not.  Even though I was never drunk I get paranoid that people will think I am drunk and judge me as such.  Or not take the things I am saying seriously because they think I am drunk. Or, or, or. And this does not make me feel anymore socially acceptable, not even CLOSE. But I did enjoy seeing faces that I havent seen.  The awkward hellos and sometimes half smiles and no hellos because it has been so ridiculously long since Ive seen these acquaintances that I would not even begin to know what to talk about.  So I sort of do this darting around thing with my head hung low.  So as not too make too much direct eye contact.  Some was unavoidable. I did hug a girl who seemed very familiar.  She was very excited to see me and called me by name. This was weird because I couldnt even guess what her name was.  I acted like I saw someone I knew and told her Id be right back but never did.  I have no idea who she is but when I saw her later she looked pissed that I never came back to talk to her about God knows what.  eh. 
I need money.  I do not regret quitting my job but I do regret not saving more...Ive got about another week left until I will be desperately looking for a job or things to sell.  Or both. 

And the boy to my immediate left in the computer lab looks just like Billy House circa 1999, long, blonde hair pulled back into a pony tail and all.  Its freaking me out cause Im seeing him in my peripheral vision.  He looks like he is having a fun time and keeps bursting into laughter even though he is here alone.  For some reason this is making me feel nice.  

On a lighter note...you want to know a secret?

That in this three years of seperation I have failed to secure any amount of decency in a relationship.  Not a one, really.  The past three years have been a blur of drugs and booze and cleaning up and then working obsessively because when I put down one habit I must pick up another. And so much social awkwardness.  More than one can comprehend. I used to be so eloquent once...now Im just this mess of mania and depression and I cant seem to connect the two ever.  Or predict the two...ever.
When I talk to most friends about this, about him, they cant look me in the eye.  Even the ones that didnt know him.  Especially the ones that did.  I got to keep a few.  
I am not going to feel heartbroken about this.  Not again.  Heartbreak over and over.  Its always something. 
A new feeling, the same feeling. I mean really.
I cant even begin to describe the emptiness... 

But secretly...I hope he is happy.  Because I am not as angry as I want to be.  Mostly broken inside, a little bitter.  But I never wanted it to be like this.  
Marriage was the demise of my relationship, i really do believe that.  And the little bit of crazy that one goes through when moved for the 5th time in 2 years to a place completely unfamiliar with absolutely nothing to hold on to, not even you. 

I think I needed to get this out. Because really?  I havent been able to let my mind think past it for what seems like days on end.  I am in need of a little comfort.  And Ive already decided to paint a HUGE therapy piece...Ive just got to get this out. 

God, I am so sorry."

If I had my way I would order everything online and never step foot in a mall.  My anxiety of crowds and shopping and pressure would greatly appreciate this I am completely sure.  If I start now, it is completely do-able.  And I just found the perfect present for one half of my favorite gruesome twosome...Even though I really dont expect a present in return...I am so obsessed with finding the perfect present.

"event","I feel like...
My life is not my own
My body hates me
I dont hadle stress well
There is never enough time in a day
Im tired all too often 
I need money like nobodys business
Im avoiding my problems
Im putting things off for no reason except that I dont want to face them
I wish I could fast forward life slightly... only a few months

I have so much to get done."

"event","I never update this thing, though I check my friends list all too often.  Nothings going on.  Except that I just got my wisdom teeth out and I've been in horrible agony and heavily doped up for the past few days.  The latter of which I didnt mind at all.  School and work, repeat. I started painting again.  I started writing again.  And I've been drinking hot tea obsessively.  So Heather bought me a whistling tea pot for my birthday and some big coffee cups.  And my mom got me some green tea and a collection of english teas.  
Today was school and attempting to regain strength and sitting outside in a sweater, drinking some delicious hot Lady Grey tea and journal writing.  
Oh and I played with the dog alot too.  And I ate a baked potato because that's all I can actuall fucking eat anymore. 
I wish they would have given me my old teeth so I could make somekind of disgusting jewlery out of them.

I stole this from John-fucking-Memmer's journal to be cool.  But I would really appreciate your responses.  No, really.

please recommend to me:

1. a movie.
2. a book.
3. a band/artist.
4. an lj user not on my friends list that is INTERESTING"

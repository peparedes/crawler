I dropped mom off and walked the parking lot fast.  Jo's car wasn't there at 6:55 and Zach was supposed to be there at 6:30.  I checked in the chorus room, nope, Zach wasn't there.

Waited until his portion of the concert and still no Zachary.

He's the ONLY fourth grader to not be in the concert."

It was my mom.
My grandmother lost her battle with cancer this morning at 8:45 am.

Considering she was told she wouldn't live to see Christmas 2005...
Most of my life I hated her.
The past 10 years I finally got to know her.
She loved my kids.

I will miss her.

PS.  It's a testament to her sharp tongue and sense of humor that she should go on April Fools Day.  She married a man who later became a professional clown, whom she hated and loved till the day she died even though they divorced 35 years ago."

Once there were four engineers traveling in a car. While they were traveling to their destination the car stalled on them. 
Then the first engineer who was a mechanical engineer said, ""don't worry its probably engine problems. I will just pop open the bonnet and take a look at the motor"". 

Then the second engineer, who was an electrical engineer, said, ""no, no ,no. It is an electrical problem. Just let me look at the fuse box and I will find the problem"". 

The third engineer, who was a chemical engineer, said, ""its just a problem with the fuel. Flush out all of the petrol and replace it with new clean petrol and you will see that the car will be fine."" 

Then the three engineers looked at the fourth who was a computer engineer. And his response was... ""Why don't we just get out of the car, shut all of the doors, and then open them again and get back in and start it!"""

"event","For those who haven't heard yet.  I'm home now.

Since Wednesday I've been at Ellis Hospital fighting what turned out to be Viral Meningitis with some extra twists.  At first I thought it was a bad case of the flu and the Nurse Practitioner I saw on Wed afternoon agreed, for the most part.  She ran some of her concerns by the on call doctor and then I was sent home with the understanding that if any of my symptoms changed, neck got stiff, fever came back, anything, I was to call the on-call doctor at once.

A couple hours later I called because my fever was up to 102 again and rising.  I waited what I thought was the 30 minutes for him to call back... it turned out to be two hours I had blacked out.  I got to the ER just before midnight only partially able to function on my own.  I had little good functionality with my eyes, neck, balance, ears, etc... basically everything from the shoulders up was a near dead zone from pain.  The nurses looked me over sent me to a room and I waited.  About 1 AM a nurse came in and gave me a shot of Toridal (sp?) which helped some symptoms after a few hours.  Then chest x-rays, CAT scans, and a couple blood cultures later it was decided I had to have a spinal tap done.

So, now I know that spinal fluid looks like vodka.

That confirmed what I had and off to admitting I went after 4 hours of immobilization.  Since then, I've been kept coherent through the wonderful world of drugs.  Mostly, Overdose levels of Motrin.  The pills I'm on now are only 4 times the dosage of what you get over the counter.

I've been treated for Bacterial Meningitis, sinus infections, the flu, and whatever else they could think of along the way.  My doctor finally got a full dose of my pain tolerance when he asked me to squeeze his hand as hard as my head hurt when the pain killers wore off.  His knuckles will take a few days to recover.  :)

When the pain gets bad enough that I can not see, hear, or keep my balance and I'm already on the IV pain killer.  I'm not joking when I say, IT HURTS!

We also found out that my health, even though I'm still really sick, is getting better and better.  With all of the stresses going on over the past few weeks my blood pressure, while high for me, has stayed in the lower range of normal.  Pulse rate was back down as well.  Only things to worry about are getting my weight back down and getting into shape, both involve time and exercise.

So, now I'm home.  I have a note from my doctor saying I'm not to return to work until Wednesday, but I think I'm going to fight him on that.  At least see if I can work what I can from home."

I have my fingers crossed.  Things are going well with my job so my personal life is crap.  Big surprise.  *sigh*"

I'm actually trying to curb some of that.  I don't want to lose it too fast or I'm going to not be able to keep it off."

"event","Well, the friggin county denied my application for Food Stamps and Temporary Assistance on a shit hole of a reason.

""Because you didn't interview on the day you applied and we offered to do so...""

Um... NO!!!  When I applied, the woman behind the desk said, ""We're running at least 8-10 days behind on interviews.  We'll let you know when you're appointment is.""

Now, a month later, after I've tried calling them shitloads of times at the number they gave me and ALWAYS getting a message of ""We're sorry but this Mailbox is FULL"" they deny me saying I didn't try.

And of course, the number they gave for calling to get a conference no one is ANSWERING!!!

I called from my cell and left it on speakerphone.  It rang for more than an HOUR without anyone picking up.

I'm so pissed right now."

New Horizons CLC out of Albany just emailed me looking for a phone interview for a Teaching Position at the Albany office.

To bad they waited this long.  Last time I was searching for work and interviewed there they offered me a whole $8/hr to start and I had to take a bunch of certifications from them using their personal loans to do it.  Basically indentured servitude from the way they talked.  Not something I could do with kids."

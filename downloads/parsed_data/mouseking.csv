Car value:  $9800 bucks (fair market value).

Call to the police: free (thanks to a person passing by).

Standing with Rina (who came out of it with only a bump to the knee) and watching the bimbo who ran the intersection get hauled away in an ambulance:  Priceless!



Yep - Rina walked away from her first biggie with only a bruise from hitting the steering wheel with her knee, and a slight case of the shakes.  Life is good!

Gotta wait to see what State Farm has to say about this whole deal, but I expect that we'll be getting a check for around 9800 clams for replacement - there was not a whole lot left of the front end of the Saturn anymore.  Being that the police issued the other driver a citation (failure to yield), this should pretty much be a slam-dunk."

was a child long ago who would follow in your footsteps,

Playing
before Time ripped your dreams away.

Left
With a mire of small details that tie you to the ground,

Trapped 
in a life consumed by slow decay.

Look
beyond the embers of all the bridges glowing behind you,

See
a glimpse of how green it is on that other side.

Step
towards it: you will be endlessly dragged back again,

Pulled
down by the force of all your other tides.

Stay
burdened forever by your desires and ambitions,

Ignore
the hunger that remains unsatisfied,

Your
broken eyes can't help but to stray to that horizon,

Drawn
back to that road you've missed so many times."

So yeah, I work in the airline industry, on the reservation/financial/trip-processing side (I know: Yawn).  So there I was setting up some automation, when I found a most-unusual fare basis code for Delta:

<b>YOBTVOY</b>

Fare basis codes are the condensed form of pricing rules that are used for the entire trip (Y = coach fare, OBT = outbound-restricted 13 day or less, etc)

Though I think Delta may well have a hidden meaning behind this one . . . Because ""Yob Tvoy"" has a very very distinct meaning in Russian.  Google it to find out."

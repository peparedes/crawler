"event","Since this is my first review, it'll obviously be a work in progress. I have yet to think of a way to organize it, or how it will be presented. This is, so far, what I'm thinking. As more books are read, and re-read, it will most likely evolve into a more organized layout. As for now, it will be short until I can think of more ways to make things come across.

<center><b>Back Page:</b> They were masters of darkness, searching through eternity for a mistress of the light...

The stranger silently summoned her from across the continents, across the seas. He whipsered of eternal torment, of endless hunger...of dark, dangerous desires. And somehow American surgeon Shea O'Halloran could feel his anguish, sense his haunting aloneness, and she ached to heal him, to heal herself.

Drawn to the far Carpathian mountains, Shea found a ravaged, raging man, a being like no other. And she tremebled. For in his burning eyes, his icy heart, she recognized the beloved stranger who'd already become part of her. This imperious Carpathian male had compelled Shea to his side. But was she to be his hearler...or his prey? His victim...or his mate? Was he luring her into madness...or would his dark desire make her whole?</center>

What first got my attention in the book was the way the author wrote out two scenes that were happening simultaneously. Shea O'Halloran, a brilliant surgeon, grew up knowing she was not normal. Abandoned by her father since before her birth, her mother moved around the world to keep her daughter safe. I found it odd how Maggie, Shea's mother, fought to protect her unnatural daughter from scientists, yet failed to acknowledge her exisitence so frequently. Maggie had been so distraught over her lover's supposed death, she could barely function. Shea confronts how her mother was hardly a mother at all, rarely seeing to her needs and ignoring emotions completely, and spent most of her time either in bed or at the window. It never really cleared up. I am a complete sucker for emotional men, especially those who seek comfort in their partners, or lifemates in this series. For seven years, Jacques kept himself barely alive by embracing his animal-self. Having been attacked by fantatical humans, bent on destroying the 'vampire' race, Jacques spent seven years in a coffin with a stake narrowly missing his heart. He was somehow able to reach Shea and, for seven years, tortured her dreams of his misery. Thinking to have a rare-blood disease, she finds herself in the Carpathian mountains, the land of her father. Her mother's diary was the only thing Shea kept of her after the sucide when Shea was eighteen. There, she discovers the man who had been attacking her dreams. She nurses him slowly back to life, only to discover that the man isn't a man at all, but something entirely else: one who shares the same blood-disorder as herself.

Enter re-visited characters Raven and Mikhail, and the powerful healer Gregori. Something that I really liked about this book was the length and depth that the characters stayed, helping Mikhail's brother to find his mind. While Jacques fights to regain his memories and for Shea's love, Shea herself has to come in grips with this new species of people. Her scientific mind tries to constantly anaylize, and the author doesn't use high-defintion words that nobody understands. And for what wasn't understood, it was quickly explained.

Although Shea and Jacques are lifemates, I found it a little hard to accept that Shea was so quick in being natural with Jacques. At least it seemed natural to me. Jacques made it a point that he wanted her to trust him and to love him, yet I saw no real evidence of distrust. Minus there. Shea was also unwilling to accept her new-found powers which kind of irked me some, especially when they were necessary on survivial.

The humor, I thought, was actually pretty amusing. Raven and Shea both found the Carpathian males to be Tarzans; chest-beating, medieval men who always seemed to be  pushing the women aside whenever danger was around. Shea's nickname for Jacques fit the description, although cuter.

"event","Hi all.  I just got a hello birthday wish from LIve Journal, and I haven't had any contact from here in over a year, so thought I should update.  HUGE household, now. Seven.  VTravel has been living with us for close to 3 years now.  Artstar is between jobs, here again, probably going to LA next.  (The animator.)  Bean2 will graduate for his master's degree in December.  Poochy has a live-in-boyfriend, (like her Mom), and the two of them are college freshmen.  Both Hubbyone and VTravel work for phone companies, doing 'customer service' at a call center.  All of us have Facebook sites, so that's where we do this sort of thing, for the most part now.  In recent months, I've started sending out family newsletters every 7 weeks, snail mail style, as a way of keeping our Intentional Community connected with extended family and friends, open, benign/accessible.  If anybody here wants to be on that mailing list, mail your snail mail address to tikilodge@aol.com, tell me how you know me, etc."

"event","Lots of changes.  Hard to keep up, epecially knowing some will 'take', and some will not take root, they will just be sampled. <lj-cut>

Artstar returned to Chicago to live, to seek work in his profession.  (Place he graduated college from this past spring.)

Bean2 is a college senior, now, with a full academic load, plus 3 part-time jobs: internship with GE, math tutor at college where he attends, and food service: Macaroni Grill, Sundays sometimes.  He also sells plasma.  Has stopped doing much theatre, except still doing Enchanted Forest for Halloween, a volunteer job of many years' habit.  (Fundraiser for Independence, Mo. community theatre.)

Poochy is a highschool senior.  Currently cast in ""Steel Magnolias,"" and performances begin tonight.  She bought ""dinner theatre"" tickets for us to attend their special opening night fundraiser dinner.  She's got Shirley McClain's role, Weezy?  I don't know how it's spelled.  Sarcastic rich bitch; important humor role.

VTravel has been back in our lives for a while now.  Still unsteady and unpredictable, but says he's resolved to transition into co-habiting with us, beginning with half-week overnighters, beginning a week from tomorrow.  

Visited neice last night --- Hubbyone's brother's eldest.  (Brother who died past December, part of the great upheaval of the past year.)  Feel good about reconnecting.  Feel we are still on task as resolved.

Habits are hard to change, all 'round, but determined.

Returned to substitute school teaching after crappy experience looking for work full time all year, and crappy help from Women's Employment Network.

Have resumed attending a church.  Picked a new community.  Shawnee Mission Unitarian...  Out there near our favorite YMCA.  Decided if we win a lottery or otherwise become instantly solvent, we are moving into that area.  Been active in the choir.  Been feeling like people are interested in my friendship.  Feels weird / scary.  Nice to be in a community that is mostly relaxed and sociable, in spite of being pretty high IQ and economically secure.  (NOT like All Souls UU, near the plaza...)  Two more branches from church:  Grief Support Group, Environmental Support Group, and Sustainable Sanctuary Coalition.

Still thinking on the Not-for-Profit idea, ""Creative Play for World Decompression.""  Have some good ideas on how to introduce it.  Still need partners...

Still keeping the labyrinth a vital part of my life routine and foundational sustenance.  Gardening is excellent idea.  So is aligning chakras while following path, using music toning & belly dance moves...

Miss Mikki, Kim...  

Sorta better with old friend, Julie.  Sorta have a new 'friend' in cousin Sandra Sue.  

Don't have much depth with anybody outside this family, though.  

Still trying to hold to that ""no sugar, no wheat"", anti-addiction diet.

Got three orange stripe kittens in desperate need of new homes.

Dropped out of doing community theatre for the time being.  Too costly.  Not priority.  Making money, getting out of the red, getting promises made regarding credit borrowing from kids' fullfilled...  (In the doghouse financially, with the kids...)

The good thing is: it's free.  We filled out an application a few months ago.  Free, based on our income at the time.  We're still miserably indebt and struggling, but Hubbyone got work, even though it pays only 1/3 what previous job paid, it's something.  

Weatherization surprises --- they came in today and said ""Clear out this closet and this space, so we can access the attic trap door.""  Bean2's bedroom is the most stagnant, oppressive, overwhelmed-with-baggage space in the house.  And the whole closet got emptied in less than an hour --- most of it dropped into Poochy's room.  (On an impulse yesterday, I'd cleared her floor yesterday.  Lucky...)  

Then the utility room --- the hanging clothes, pets, and plants had to be removed.  Now bury one couch in the living room, and consume a corner across from the computer wall...

Do I need to say my home is upside down, and I am exhausted, just walking through it?

But insulation has been blown into the attic, now, and ducts have been wrapped, and light bulbs changed into florescent efficient ones.

Hubbyone's new hours has him home Fridays & Saturdays, so I get his company some, now.

Artstar is home from college in Chicago, newly graduated.

Hubbyone lost his 'new' job this week, after only a week and a half ON the job --- fired the same day Gateway closed shop a year ago, and sent over a hundred staff walking, with Hubbyone...

Too much to carry, not enough to lean on.

I am in the process of being considered for a very good job --- a big improvement on my earnings...  

This job will kinda demand the kind of physical stamina I had when I was 20, though, and I am past 50...

I AM in excellent health for my age, obsessive about getting plenty of vegetables, protein, etc. every day --- no caffeine, no refined sugar...  I also do yoga workouts 2 - 3 times a week.  But trust me, this job is gonna challenge me if I get it, and I want to be able to KEEP it --- we NEED me to get a good job like this.

So, HOW do I 'super-power' my ongoing physical stamina in a healthy way?  Ideas?

I'll write about the job AFTER they offer it to me.</lj-cut>"

My family's dysfunction really parades in a crisis.  Not the one I made, but the family I come from.  Only two relatives of Dad's are in the ""inner circle"" of contact, his grandkids from my brother in prison, and they didn't even notify their own father in prison.  

I got my news by aggressing on Dad's pastor in Mountain View, Mo.  And I was the only one contacting every other key relative: Dad's brother, sister, and both his sons, my brothers...  And the ONLY one of these I have been ACKNOWLEDGED by for YEARS has been the brother in prison.

My father used to be Chief Appraiser of the Corps of Engineers when I was a child.  He was also in charge of the missile base in Sedalia back in the '60's.  And my oldest brother is CEO of his own company, manufacturing domestic robots.  (The oldest brother was my primary perpetrator, sex abuse, when I was in gradeschool, and his life is fashioned around a non-stop territorial war, or alpha-wolf dominance war, with our father...)

My oldest brother curses Dad continuously as a deeply narccistic sadist.  And my other brother, the 'middle' child, in prison, prays for Dad's soul and had written Dad before he died, warning him that God will not forgive people who are unforgiving, that Dad needs to forgive and make ammends...  

The two 'orphans' of the brother in prison, the daughter whose sexual abuse resulted in my brother's imprisonment, and the younger brother --- they are 'running' Dad's arrangements for Memorial Services, etc., and have resolved to join Dad in the hate-game, and not contact any blood family.  

So, will the pastor tell us in time when and where the Memorial Service will be?  Only time will tell.

Meanwhile, all kinds of realignments are occurring with family on both MY side and Hubbyone's --- over recent deaths...

Hubbyone left for work as usual this morning, and came home extra early, fired.  Right after lunch, we went out together --- he applied for unemployment again, and we put in for food stamps again, too.  

Got a new book that's gleaning some deeeeeep insight regarding childhood trauma issues, and appropriate treatment.  ""Just Before Dawn,"" by Jan Hindman.  Been discussing it lots, ongoing, with Hubbyone.  Wish I could discuss it with lots of others.  Significant insights and perspective.

Been trying to 'bond' via phone my neice whose father died last month --- he was living with her when he died --- I feel she is most 'in jeopardy' and have a resolve to be a -'better-late-than-never' 'parent/mother figure to her.  She really got a shit deal, regarding childhood...

Had an intense phone call with her a couple days ago, but significant.

Had a lunch date with a guy last week --- had a last-minute cancellation, and no contact since then.  Been calling, etc., but no follow-up.

Why am I the only 'stability' I can ever cling to?  Well, there's prayer...  Oh, and the sacred library card.  Love books.

Considering the context, and the fact Hubbyone and I didn't do a stitch of Christmas shopping, this has been a remarkably nice Christmas.

Artstar bought the most costly and thoughtful presents for everyone, but Poochy, who depended on 'credit' with her older brother, based on salary pending from her job after Christmas, also did well --- especially getting my 'best' present.

Bean2, Hubbyone, and I got a 'free ride,' gift-wise.  We may do some after-Christmas compensation shopping, especially for Artstar.

Best gift to me from Artstar, the DVD of the movie, ""Waiting for Guffman.""  (Spoof on community theatres.  We already have ""Mighty Wind,"" where the folk duo resemble the personalities of Hubbyone and I so much, we cry when they sing.)

Best gift to me from Poochy is a thrift store find, a full length, very folky/classy denim dress.  I look FABULOUS in it.  It has a kind of textured patchwork thing across the chest, with a touch of tinsel-thread, so it shines slightly.  The neckline is a deep U shape, very becoming, fits snug on the chest, but lengthens my neck.  I just look fabulous in it, really.  Buttons up the center front all the way to the floor.  

Best present to Hubbyone from Artstar is probably the DVD movie ""Fatso"" with Dom Deluise.  He cried when he opened it.

Bean2's best present came from Artstar --- Season 4 DVD collection of ""News Radio.""

Biggest surprise gift was from our super-helpful neighbors, more enduring and accessible than anybody we've ever known including family --- they brought over a PIE.  We had, by COINCIDENCE felt a 'crisis' last night for forgetting to buy any pie, and made panic-substitution purchase from K-mart of some brownie mix.  Which is NOT pie.  

Artstar saw to it we have plenty of games to explore leisurely all day --- the Saturday Night Live rendition of Trivial Pursuit goes all the way back to GILDA RADNER.  He also got us a DVD thing to add to our ""Scene It"" game.

And, with a touch of 'fatherly' concern, our SON got Hubbyone and I a BOOK, ""Auto Repair for Dummies.""  

Those are just highlights, but Artstar carried the show, and Poochy embellished.  We are grateful.  And feeling 'rich' in our own way.  (Artstar works odd art jobs, like t-shirt designs...)

Last night, while the family was eating at Hometown Buffet, out at a restaurant for the first time in months, our car was broken in, and the CD radio was stolen.  Broke the window out of the passenger side, and assorted damage from break-in effort at the door.  (Bean2's car, mainly.  The family arrived in relays, with Hubbyne arriving last in that car.)

Hubbyone was last because he was obsessing over fixing the broken faucet in the bathtub --- even though I'd persuaded a good neighbor to look at it, Hubbyone was determined to do the most he could to keep the price down.  Obsession is the catalyst to a lot of hardship escalating, a hardship magnet.

We buried Bubbyone's brother two weeks ago, the 9th.  On the 8th the white van developed a scary noise en route to thrift stores in search of dark suits to wear to the funeral.  On the 11th, en route to getting taken to work by Hubbyone, (I'd taken a substitute teaching job), the red car overheated to dangerous level, and I ended up sorta hitchhiking to work while he got the car towed.  (And it was nearly impounded before his tow truck arrived for blocking the street; he had to argue with the police for it...)

Sat. evening, 12-16, I talked to Dad.  He reported he had surgery scheduled for 12-26.  Estranged father has suddenly rekindled relationship with me?  He told me he loved me.  He told me that the time he retrieves from surgery he will devote to getting to know my family.  Next day he calls to tell me that all contracts made while on morphine are off, that he's completely sober now, and that the only way he'll let me back in his life is if I come crawling on my knees in apology to he and his wife, that I am banned from ever speaking to him or his grandson Kyle again.  (A nephew of mine, son of brother's.)  Making me cry like that made Hubbyone open up his pent up rage, bitterness, etc., and the scene resulted in a battle between he and the kids, with him making suicide threats.  Hubbyone ended up getting taken away by the police, and was gone the next night at Research Psychiatric. 

Strange reversal from that situation, briefly --- received a Christmas card from my oldest brother, ANOTHER estranged relative, containing a large sum of CASH, and very casual explanation.  (Did he KNOW what an ASSHOLE our Dad had just been?)

The next day I pulled Hubbyone OUT of that place for lame ""therapeutic"" response --- wanting to take him off the blood pressure medication he's been on for 5 years, the ONLY medication that's EVER WORKED.

Hubbyone needs his sleep apnea machine adjusted.  He has for months, actually, but now it would really-really help to get better quality sleep.  At night he hears his brother's voice, very audibly, say, ""I think I'm really sick this time.  I'm really not well.""

I feel like all I can do is rest up for the next crisis.  The kids are still trying to make a 'normal happy' Christmas out of the situation, but it feels like it just won't stop.

Going to YMCA now with Hubbyone... (Routine>

On the day of the wake --- while hurrying from thrift store to thrift store, desperate to find dark suits for the boys, the white van started making a hideous whir noise --- too scary to drive any more.  It's parked in the driveway, now, waiting for money to repair it.

And then, down to two vehicles, then, I needed a ride to work this morning --- I took work subbing --- and en route there the red car dangerously overheated, and didn't get 'better' over mere antifreeze, so it got towed, and we walked/hitched a ride to work.  (Bean2 was called from home, and he cried when the police tried to impound our vehicle before our OWN tow truck arrived --- and Hubbyone had to argue to get them to unhitch it, so we could take it to a shop.)

Down to ONE vehicle, and 4 people with agenda in need of transportation.

That on top of NO MONEY even for FOOD hardly, trying to rush funeral 'sympathy card' checks of $50 or $25 to the bank, to keep our own checks from bouncing...

Hubbyone hasn't been back to work yet --- he can't make any money at this new job, it's an exercise in futility.  (Sales --- different company from Gateway --- he's never sold this before...)

I have over a dozen applications or resumes out, but...

And the way it feels --- it feels like the recently deceased brother-in-law's incredibly bad luck cloud moved over to us, giving a 'dose' of what life was like for him MOST of his life.  It feels like punishment.

Hanging in there, but really-really bitter and scared.

A week ago Wednesday my Dad called.  I haven't seen him in 10 years, and spoke to him only briefly about 5 years ago on the phone because they moved my brother, & I couldn't find him.  (Brother in prison.)  I sent him Holiday Newsletters along with everyone else yearly.  That was the only contact, one direction, nothing FROM him.

He called to let me know he's got a rare kind of stomach cancer, and because it's so rare, they don't know how to predict it or treat it.  Basically, he's on morphine, waiting to die.

Seventeen years ago my Mom died December 10 of cancer...  Morphine MASKED her feelings, though.  Made her 'pleasant' and unresponsive.  Dad --- it seems to have removed his wall.  My whole life long, Dad has never been sick, and never cried, and now, BOTH, in SPADES.  He could barely talk to me, he was so weepy.

He asked me to get the word out, to call anybody I wanted, but he named Martin, my oldest brother, specifically.  So I did.  Made a series of calls.  First to his sister.  Then to his brother --- I spoke with his sister-in-law, my aunt...  The sister at least sends me a Christmas card every year.  The brother's family ignores my Holiday cards the way Dad & Martin have for years.  But the calls went okay.  Lots of updates on news.  Acted casual...  People don't talk about the past.  They just kinda cut their losses...

Anyway, I'd left a message at Martin's work, and he called back.   Another big first after about that many years silence.  About 8 years ago we offered to stop by their home in California when we were that direction for vacation, and Martin told me his wife hates me too much, & won't permit me in their home.  (This in spite of the fact only a couple years prior we had let Martin stay with us when Grandma died, for the funeral...)  

Anybody who thinks I am too uppity or too abrasive ought to take a peek at the way I've been treated.  I HAVE to wrap a lot of love and protective regard around myself, 'cause my family most certainly will not.  The ""diplomat"" of the family, the one most resolved to keep peaceful connection with everyone?  That's the brother in prison.  The 'throw away.'  The message I got from it: to care openly for some people is to be regarded least valuable.

I am so glad I have the ability to be BOTH loving AND tough/prideful.  I take care of myself AND remember how I feel about people, BOTH.

-------------
I wrote more, then tried to 'save, and lost it instead.  Now I'm tired --- don't want to rehash it right now.  Short story: brother-in-law died this past Tuesday.  BIIIIIG deal to my Hubbyone.  Funeral Saturday.  I'll try to share about it some other time.

Just --- in blind state of 'nuts' right now in many ways.

Okay, no, I want to say this part --- felt competent to face husband's stuff more than my own.  Liked how he suddenly got in ""love with life"" and more affectionate, more aggressive, more self-defined/affirmative than he generally is.  Now he's into some sort of overdrive place --- wants to maybe quit his job and go back to college to major in Health Psychology, which, yes, I agree is a good thing, but the pace of his energies right now is a, what, suspicious thing?

I have lived forever with a man with ambiguous regard for life --- eating disorders, food addiction, obsession with death and dead parents, and the only times he's ever been really 'virile' have been when he was nearly dead-thin, on the most defiant extreme of NOT being a compliant fatty the way he was raised to be.

Right now he is manically playing his violin, and wants me to jam with him.  I love this man very much.  When he's happy.  He is the sexiest, most cuddly, alluring thing that every breathed IF his feelings are in a GOOD place because he is so infectious.  And, is the word effervescent?  Means his kids all have great stage presence, 'cause they kinda 'glow' a climate.  That's my husband's influence.  The all pervasive 'glow.'  It's nice if the feeling is good, but he doesn't have good reins on himself a lot of the time.  He doesn't know the distance between enough and too much.  I love the zeal, but I've seen where it can go, and 'virility' spells 'raging defiance' or even 'death wish' with this guy...

So I am hiding on the computer....

Fiddle tune: Arkansas Traveler.  Hard to believe someone could be in a 'bad' place while playing that...  But...

And Bean2 joined her THIS year, first carving from a print-out stencil of the trick-or-treat kids from ""Nightmare Before Christmas.""  Then, the idea of making ME the topic of a Halloween pumpkin came to Bean2.

He IMed Artstar in Chicago to make a pattern for them.  Then Bean2 explored making a stencil HIMSELF based on a photo of me.   Poochy used Artstar's stencil, and Bean2 used his own.  TWO pumpkins feature MY FACE.

This is waaayyyy cooler than the 'standard' kind of birthday present.  I loooove this family.  Creative people are always thinking up surprising new things.  

I had purchased extra pumpkins on sale at Aldi's yesterday because they were so invigorated with the business of making really-really FANCY pumpkin carvings using those stencils.  The pumpkin's were in semi-bad condition, but only $1.50, so I bought four.  

This very unplanned, low expectation birthday, my 51st, has turned into a real sweetie."

I've been struggling with depression a lot recently.  This movie really picked up my spirits.  And I think Yoko Ono is gonna become a hero of mine.  Reasons:  She inspired courage in John, and that let his whole self come forward to bloom.  She also took an interesting attitude to how controversial she was.  She said that when she gives a concert, if half the audience doesn't walk out halfway into the show, she feels a failure because it's her intention to make people FEEL things very strongly.  

Wow.  I have been good at offending or disturbing people for years, but I've always been surprised, and hurt by it.  I KNOW I provoke strong feelings in others.  I just INTEND to really REACH them, not drive them away.

But there she was, the cool focus that somehow penetrated the soul of John Lennon, and, even though socially ostricized for a time, and terribly maligned, the love between them compensated for all the ""losses.""  

To connect that deeply, even with only one other person, is more gratifying than all the popularity and acceptibility in the world. They had each other, and that was enough. Furthermore, the liberated soul attains immortality, for fullfilling his/her greatness.

So Yoko Ono is COOL, and I'm gonna use her as a touchstone, of sorts, to lift me out of depression now.

So I am thankful.

Good movie.  I recommend it.

"event","On Witches Meetup Message Board, someone mentioned our full moon being extra-conducive to induction magic, since it is extra-large, extra-close.  Coincidently, I am right on task, in motion, already.

I plan to edit this post, etc. over time.  This will centralize my most evolved planning for the labyrinth.  LAST UPDATE: 9-10-06

<lj-cut>
Current situation, with boundary defined by bricks and clothesline rope makes it hard to keep the grass from overcoming the path.  And it's complicated to mow.  
---------------
stepping stones
----------------
Already decided the best way to guarantee a labyrinth path is stepping stones.  Then the 'borders' can become garden, for vegetables, herbs, and flowers.   
 
I can walk the labyrinth in 250 steps to the center.

When one solution comes, other solutions follow.  The price of a stepping stone runs $1.60 each at Home Depot.  The price of a stepping stone mold is $3 at Michael's, and an 80 lb. bag of cement is less than $5.  Solution: make our own stones.   Making our own stones also gives us 250 opportunities to express ourselves.  (With designs, paint, writing...)

So far, using up one entire cement bag got us 8 stones.  Been working with those numbers to decide what our stone-making pace needs to be, to complete the circuit before spring.  

At LEAST a bag a week, and better to make TWO bags worth.

The process reminds me of my childhood days, exactly like making mud pies.  The stick doesn't stir as well as the hands, and the mix is mildly scratchy and sucks all moisture out of the hands, so I've started using rubber gloves.  But cement dust/gravel plus water equals a 'mud' substance that is easily squished and blended like clay or dough.  

We will be playing with how to decorate each stone.  Right now we're using things we already had on hand, like the orange and purple aquarium gravel that was once in our turtle tank. We also have a huge stash of glitter. Poochy is wishing for mosaic.

------------------
Stepping stone THEME ideas:
------------------
We have a lot of elbow room to create.  Some advance planning will make the walking experience interesting.

1) What's the name of that Chinese Theatre that has space in the sidewalk out front, where all the stars immortalize their hand or foot prints in the cement, along with their names?  We should do that.  Have at least one stone per family member, significant relationships, and pets that bears our 'print.' (Radabaughs.) I am not above figuring out how to seal PHOTOS of us on the stones...

2) ""Twelve-Step"" Recovery Stones.  Have 12 stones distinctively similar that are located maybe 20 steps apart, so they are equally distributed throughout the labyrinth.  I don't know what word or sign to use, to evoke the meaning of each of the steps in the program, but I want to integrate that idea in some form, anyway.

3)  Runes?  Reiki symbols?  Religious symbols?  

4)  Something to commenorate significant institutions of our lives, especially those we were part of during our residence in this home.  Hickman Mills school district, Blue Springs Community Theatre, UMKC, Columbia College in Chicago, Hallal Mart? Aldi's? Nelson-Atkin's Art Museum, Home Town Buffet? Quick Trip? Powell Gardens Spooktacular, Enchanted Forest, 

5)  Can we condense the musicals this family's participated in, into something stone-worthy?  Music Man.  Jesus Christ Superstar.  Wonderful Life.  Fiddler on the Roof.  Bye Bye Birdie.

plants
-------------
The other dimension is deciding what to plant.

Each ring represents a chakra level.  Red-base, orange, yellow-belly, green-heart, blue-creativity & communication throat, purple-intuition, white-crown-divine connection, and then the center...

The outer circuits have the most space: red, orange, and yellow.

The inner circuits are kinda cramped' may need to be limited to herbs and flowers: blue, purple, and white.

Orange is definitely gonna have a few pumpkins growing.  Perfect womb symbol for that location.  

Red-base may have beets --- good root vegetable that is also very red... 

So many vegetables to contemplate.
Okra, parsnips, carrots, eggplant, 

I am wanting to create a natural border around the whole labyrinth for privacy.  I am thinking corn, and sunflowers.  Do people ever grow those things together?  
-------------
Scarecrows?
------------
I wish for a few other embellishments.  Scarecrows?

-----------
Stone garden animals
-----------------
I am also wishing for little stone garden animals, or things that carry some playful or deep message, like representatives of my/our totem animals.  (Mine are polar bear, brown recluse spider, alligator, whooping crane, turkey vulture, white-tail deer fawn, ostrich, and iguana...)
-------------
Lighting
-------------
And at the four pivot points I wish to have torch lights, so maybe we can walk the labyrinth at night?  

And maybe something that reflects light, or gives off light, irredescent around the path here and there?
----------------
Inviting Animal Guests?
--------------------
And at the center cross, at the joint, I want something really special.  Some time ago I latched onto the notion of a Martin House.  When I was a little girl, I always marvelled at those ""bird motels.""  I read about them some.  Purple Martins are symbolic of harmonious community, and for attracting community.  I could go for that.  But I've never had a Martin House before, and they're not that simple to contruct or attend...  (From what I've read.)

The other ideas for that center area is either bird bath, or bird feeder.  I currently have a simple pink bowl with a rooster in the middle.  Just sitting in the center of that cross that defines the structural foundation of the labyrinth...

Some plants could be selected specifically to attract butterfly visitors...

Thinking...

This was a family project, to some degree.  My son did MOST of it: wrote the script, drew the characters animated, and did all the voices.  HOWEVER, my HUSBAND drew the backgrounds, and my DAUGHTER created the music score.  (Age 16.)  He names everyone involved in the credits.

A good percentage of the work was done 'backstage' during rehearsal and performance time of ""Bye Bye Birdie"", especially the backgrounds, and animating the figures.
  
(Husband sat around with a sketchbook and a handful of sharpies, drawing backgrounds...
My son has a laptop computer --- he's been carrying this project around with him everywhere, even as a passenger in the car, running errands, etc.)

Labyrinths [videorecording]: their mystery and magic   Price, Penny, filmmaker.  

I loooove the universality of this tool/toy.  It feels like I've tapped something really profound, and it's okay to play with it, too.  The kids are even on board, envisioning like everything.  (How to decorate/define it, mostly, at this time.)

I WISH people outside of this family would visit, and walk it.  I would like to know what they think.  However, maybe it is just as well.  I remember reading something somewhere about the importance of deeply prvate time for newborns to 'bond' with 'mother.' And ""newborns"" come in many forms...  (The book discouraged exposing an infant to the public, or too many energies that weren't screened --- that the vulnerability of a newborn is overwhelmed and even endangered in that context.  Old traditions, like staying at home, served worthwhile purposes, back when...)

Yeah, I'm just excited, and wanted to crow about it this morning...

Love the video.  Highly recommend getting the video.  Would definitely inspire others to make their own labyrinths.  NOT HARD!  </lj-cut>"

As you can see, we accomplished a great deal towards that end. LAST summer that space was where grass grew the THICKEST. <img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v315/kcsongwriter/labyrinth002.jpg"" />&nbsp;<br />That's me, demonstrating how the labyrninth works. You walk it. It is a one-path only, and you go the same path out as you walked in. It's a meditative tool --- goes back centuries all over the world.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v315/kcsongwriter/labyrinth001.jpg"" />&nbsp;<br /><br />Our labyrinth is constructed from clothesline rope, held in place with assorted bricks, rocks, flower pots, and ice cream tubs filled with dirt. The occasional white or arched pole comes from the canopy that once graced our swingset loft. Summary: organized junk. And isn't it charming? Can you envision how lovely this can evolve?&nbsp;<br /><br />There is some garden wire fencing here-and-there. New stuff lines the east side of the entrance and the center 'finish.' The OLD stuff is barely visible, and lines the beginning path on the WEST side, sorta across from the new stuff --- in the photo sorta looks like where the boundary line disappears. That fencing would look FABULOUS with flower vines growing on it, like Morning Glories? Or Sweet Peas?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>At the far end of the path, the NORTH direction, I have actual SEEDS in those flower pots, of Asters. Envision a series of flowering pots and maybe knick-knacks lining the path. Envision something like wood chips or leaves smashing the path down, so there is no grass to mow. Begins to look like a charming little garden, amusing like a miniature golf place... </div>

<div>This past January, my daughter got us intrigued about the magical attributes of labyrinths -- in the process of tracking info for HER at the library, I watched one of the videos and fell in love. Then, for Pagan holiday, Brigid, February 2, (commonly known as Groundhogs Day), this family observed the holiday by drawing a more primitive labyrinth on our kitchen floor, and taking turns walking it. (Candles, and symbols of prosperity coupled with the 'magical' context of both 'fire and water' cleansing and prosperity symbols, (as expressed by stove and sink), plus some stuffed animal cows, coincidently symbols of husband's work, Gateway, re-ascribed as symbols of PROSPERITY. (Cattle are often a measure of wealth.) </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The ritual was enacted to promote prosperity, and to experience a sense of 'magical rebirth' with the labyrinth, like some sort of transformation ritual... Brigid is often used as an initiation day for witches... </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I posted in this LJ immediately after that event: <a title=""http://spencer-diehard.livejournal.com/476502.html#cutid1"" href=""http://spencer-diehard.livejournal.com/476502.html#cutid1"">http://spencer-diehard.livejournal.com/476502.html#cutid1</a> </div>

<div>Anyway, interesting irony of all of that is --- the stove was caught on fire this Mother's Day, and currently getting replaced, the bathtub/shower faucets in both bathrooms are currently getting replaced, the JOB at GATEWAY is in the process of getting replaced 'cause it was terminated... </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are almost completely at a crossroads of transformation. I persisted with the resolve to build the labyrinth to intensify/support GOOD LUCK for the most spiritually well-aligned direction possible. Don't know if it''s getting GOOD results, but it most certainly seems to get RESULTS.<br /><sup>&lt;/lj-cut&gt;</sup></div>"

<lj-cut>
Part of its good was boosted by coincidence.  Darling daughter Poochy has recently taken an interest in studying labyrinths.  She is a wonderful ""apprentice"" witch.  (I say that like I'm teaching her, or she's 'following' me, and really, she's just following my example, accepting inspiration, then going off on her own direction.)

She asked me to track down info. books from the library a few days ago on the labyrinths, and I compulsively requested a few videos, too.  (I like educational videos very much.  Does that mean I'm a couch potato seeker of knowledge?)

Anyway, she was already reading her book privately.

I had a resolve to at least acknowledge Brigid yesterday by reading information about it from Starhawk'a book, ""Circle Round"" to the family, and then playing the tunes on the piano a few times, to get it into our ears.  I read to Poochy and Bean2 early that afternoon while Hubbyone was at work.

Early evening, when I got home from work, I popped in a video, ""Labyrinths: Their Mystery and Magic,"" and was immedidately inspired.

Poochy watched casually from the other couch, and quietly 'goosed' my enthusiasm at intervals with grounded readiness to make plans for making one...

Well, among the things Labyrinths accomplish, they make great initiation rites, and Brigid is an initiation day, and I've been FEELING on the cusp of something WONDERFUL.

Poochy said her book had one example of a labyrinth that was quite simple, and she proposed us making it in our kitchen.

Kitchen would be perfect place to hold this -- it has both elements sacred to Brigid: Water and Fire.  (Cooking stove is fire.)

Well, we mobilized.  After Hubbyone got home from work around 10 p.m., he got a crash course on what was going on while he ate his dinner.   Meanwhile, Poochy laid out the 'labyrinth' in the kitchen.

I also contacted Artstar, IMed him --- and rapidly got him informed, and a plan for including him in play.  I wanted some sort of surrogate of him, and he suggested the sketchbook 'diary' he carried around all through high school.  I knew just where it was.

Wonderful ritual.  The labyrinth was very small, and we could only enter it one at a time, but I did my best to 'set the climate' with candles, etc., and everything just felt so magical and precious.  Hubbyone, who was least prepared, expressed amazement at how balanced and grounded the ritual made him feel.

This morning, both Poochy and I discovered we have independently made the same observation: there is room in our garage for a more 'permanent' one of these.  I propose we chalk-draw the labyrinth on the rug down there.

I am so grateful for that nearly spontaneous, very inspired experience.  Happy-happy!

I have a 'regular' part-time job, teaching. Dobbs Elementary. Don't know my title yet, but I see the same classroom of 20+ kids after school Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays until the end of the school year, I guess, from 3:45 to 5:30 p.m., 2nd & 3rd grade curriculum.  Like a ""real"" teacher.  I look at this and feel oneness with Peggy Hill.  (""King of the Hill"" animated sit-com.)  I get to establish policy, and seating charts, and how to present the lessons, and, and, and...  Geeze their program is disorganized.  Really fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants --- they called me this morning, I started this afternoon, and didn't get the lesson books or materials given/explained to me until after class...  Having to read up this evening to get my bearings.  But I made a seating chart --- woo-hoo!  They call it ""tutoring"" but really it's just more schooling.  Today was just the run-through, I think.  

It was kinda neat to realize the years of substitute teaching experience made me feel 'competent' with nothing prepared and no training or explanation of how this system works.  

Now, if we can only get that 3rd vehicle out of repair, I can start doing TWO jobs: regular subbing more often by day, and after-school ""tutoring"" later.  

Yes, I am really Peggy Hill.

They tell us that they have stopped going to events or have left established groups because they are tired of the drama and trauma they find there. Others are ""burned out"" from years of service and need rest. Thus, in many places, we have once again become a ""mystery religion"". By this I mean that you really have to know someone, get lucky, or search very hard to find good groups or teachers. In fact, many experienced Pagans now prefer to circle only with those people they have known and trusted for years. Many open circles have closed, many groups are disbanding, and many a good event has been canceled. Ask Pagan people why this is, and you'll be told that the ""Problem Children"" have spoiled the community for them. Just recently, a Pagan parent called me to bemoan the lack of trustworthy, reliable, grown-ups among us. To this I replied, <I>""It helps to understand that we really are a mystery religion. The mystery is how we ever find any other healthy, functional Pagans."" </I>That made her laugh, she knows how it is. <BR><BR>Fritz Jung, co-founder of The Witches' Voice, recently commented on this issue at their web page. He wrote:<BR><BR><I>""Over the past few years, some of the most giving and honorable Pagans we know have bowed out gracefully from our community. To say this is a tragedy would be an understatement. It's never a 'dramatic departure' with this type... They simply stopped helping out. Many speak of 'burn out' and we sure hear that... Personally, we no longer give any energy to those looking to pick fights or with a bitch/zero solution agenda.""

<CENTER><I>""Stars are easy. People are hard"" </I><BR>- <B>Terry Pratchett</B></CENTER><BR>Too often newcomers enter the Pagan circle hoping to find a group of superior beings. What they really find, if they are lucky, is a group of pretty-nice-people-on-the-path. We are human. We have flaws. That's as it should be. In some cases, though, what a newcomer finds is far more troubling and unhealthy. Many a trusting person has been sucked into a dysfunctional Pagan group and come out of it abused, burned out, or disillusioned. This problem needs to be addressed on both the individual and the tribal levels. As individuals, we must develop and support healthy boundaries and our groups need to establish responsible, effective ways to deal with the abusers who lurk among us.

<CENTER><I>""It's been fun, but I have to scream now."" </I></CENTER><BR>There are three main reasons why Pagan Organizers burn out. The first is overwork and stress. Some of us have to face the fact that we are better at taking care of others than we are at taking care of ourselves. When our Priest/ess work devolves into codependency or workaholic behavior, it does no one any good. In such cases, the Organizer must then take time to reflect, make changes, and heal.<BR><BR>The second main reason Organizers drop out is because they can no longer stand the constant, carping criticism from those among us who do not do the work, but feel entitled to publicly and nastily judge things they wot not of. Finally, most Organizers struggle with the challenge of finding good, responsible volunteers, and training them to do the job well.

Magical thinking is an illogical mode of thinking based on fantasy, rather than reality. It is diametrically opposed to <I>real</I> magickal thinking which is what a healthy Pagan does.<BR><BR>To understand real magickal thinking we must consider the definition of magick. To quote Starhawk's famous phrase: ""Magick is the art of changing consciousness at will."" She goes on to state in her book <B><I>Dreaming The Dark</I></B>, <I>""</I>because every change we make is a change in a relationship in which we take part, we cannot cause change without changing ourselves."" Wise Pagans know this mystery: <B>If we change the world inside, the outside world will change, as well.</B> (You'll notice that it dovetails rather nicely with the definition of recovery.)<BR><BR>Magickal thinking requires we live a life beyond the norm. Such a life involves commitment, self-examination, honesty, and what the Buddhist's call ""right action"". Have you ever wondered why so many people stay stuck at the first level of Pagan practice (the part with the toys and the clothes)? It's because levels 2, 3, and beyond challenge us to grow.<BR><BR><BR><B><FONT color=#000066 size=3>Paganism and the Sacred Wound:</FONT></B><BR><BR>
<CENTER><I>""Healthy systems value discovery and understanding rather than unquestioning obedience""</I> <BR>- <B>John Cleese</B></CENTER><BR>The problem, dear friends, lies not in our Paganism, but in our selves. As psychologist Robin Skynner notes, people interpret religious and spiritual teachings according to their level of mental health. A less healthy person will take a progressive idea (like ""<I>Love thy neighbor</I>"") and turn it into something far less healthy (for example: The Inquisition). Thus it is possible for a less healthy Pagan to twist the healthy ideas contained within this practice and justify (to themselves, at least) behavior which is unhealthy, abusive, bigoted, or just plain bratty. (5)<BR><BR>It is important to note that a healthy philosophy like Paganism can attract many people who are not yet healthy themselves. It's no criticism to say that many Pagans have what is known among us as a ""sacred wound"", the same sort of wound carried by mystics and spiritual seekers throughout history. Such wounds are often gained from a painful, lonely childhood or from surviving traumatic or life threatening events. As Carolyn Myss notes in her books <B><I>Sacred Contracts</I></B> and <B><I>Why People Don't Heal and How They Can</I></B>, many people who carry such wounds are often found on the edges of our society. We Pagans know that place. It is ""outside the pale"", the hidden spot in the forest where sits the cauldron of change. This is the place where progressive ideas are born and thrive.<BR><BR>Those who bear the wound of ""Outsider"" are freed from the cultural trance which enthralls so many others who live closer to the center of 'the norm"". Outsiders are thus in a unique position to see what is truly meaningful in our culture's way of life, and what is false. If an Outsider is an extrovert, they may do the work in our society that heals both our culture and our planet. These people are courageous and tough; good companions in hard times. If an Outsider is an introvert they are often a quiet force for good among their friends, families, and neighbors and a font of wisdom and good humor for anyone lucky enough to know them. Whatever their social calling may be, these same wounded people are often called to a particular spiritual path in order to heal and to find their True Selves.<BR><BR>However, some wounded people choose not to heal, but instead use their pain as their excuse to avoid taking responsibility for their lives. They live unconsciously, rather than consciously, and the fallout from their choices (choices they will not fully own or examine) affects everyone who knows them. The Gods have sent them a ""difficult gift"" and they have turned it into a job description.(6) Such Pagan people are full of excuses, and we who accept their excuses are acting as their enablers. This is one reason why Paganism has endured such a troubled adolescence, and why it struggles to come of age and take its rightful place in our culture.<BR><BR>It deserves to have a place of honor. Paganism, as the Reverend Wren Walker points out, is an ideal path for those who are looking for healing, empowerment, and growth. As she states in a groundbreaking essay titled <B><A title=http://www.unipeak.com/gethtml.php?_u_r_l_=aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aXRjaHZveC5uZXQvd3Jlbi93X2VkaXRvcmlhbHMvc2VsZl9hY3R1YWxpemF0aW9uLmh0bWw= href=""http://www.unipeak.com/gethtml.php?_u_r_l_=aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aXRjaHZveC5uZXQvd3Jlbi93X2VkaXRvcmlhbHMvc2VsZl9hY3R1YWxpemF0aW9uLmh0bWw="">Pagans and Self-Actualization</A></B>, Paganism is the very place where we can find our Best Self. That's hard work. It's also joyful, empowering, creative and deeply fulfilling and it takes courage and a willingness to change to reach that level.<BR><BR><BR><B><FONT color=#000066 size=3>Common Sense &amp; Simple Courtesy: Why are they so hard to find?</FONT></B><BR><BR>
<CENTER><I>""Mad, Bad and Dangerous To Know""</I><BR>- <B>description of a 19<SUP>th</SUP> century cad</B></CENTER><BR>Right about this point, someone is going to jump up and yell, <I>""<B>You're being judgmental!</B></I><B>"" </B>so let's address that issue here and now. Tell me, please, when did becoming Pagan mean we gave up our right to be treated with respect? I didn't give up that right, did you?<BR><BR>Practicing tolerance and being accepting of someone else's culture, lifestyle or belief system <I><B>does not</B></I> mean that we have to put up with things like lying, sexual predation, acting out, bigotry, hypocrisy, carelessness, cruelty, selfishness, rudeness, poor planning, self righteousness, lame excuses, neglect, addictive/destructive behavior, nasty gossip, stealing, or temper tantrums. This is nothing more than bad behavior masquerading as magick. Is <I>this</I> the sort of community we want to create?<BR><BR>Ah... but are we a community in the real sense of that word? The definition of a community is a group that involves ""friendly association, mutual support, commitment, and dedication to a cause, ideal, or effort."" It is not something we ""do"" just at full moons or at festivals, it is something we live within and support. It is equitable, ongoing, reciprocal, and organic. A functional community is also well mannered. Why? Well, as my colleague Thalassa points out, standards of courtesy and etiquette were originally invented so that we could stand living with other people in close proximity (i.e. in tribes, cities and communities) and thus prevent us from killing one other out of sheer annoyance. Unfortunately, we <I>don't have</I> a Pagan community, let alone a healthy one, and our manners are often deplorable. With the exception of some small neighborhood circles, where love and dedication create a vital group, what we Pagans actually engage in is a ""Pagan scene"".<BR><BR>A scene is merely a place or event where people come to play for a short time, much like a rave party or a rock concert. Little that is made or done at a scene endures; the experience is all-important. The people who frequent a scene do not support each other as a community does. They do not care for one another in hard times, and they do not build a lasting culture. When they get bored, they leave, and go on to find another scene. (7)<BR><BR>Depending on the emotional health of those involved, a Pagan scene can be the perfect breeding ground for sexual, physical, or emotional abuse. Furthermore, many Pagans enter into a very bad bargain when they attend a Pagan scene. If the group they encounter lacks 1) commitment to and between it's members, 2) healthy social standards, and 3) the ability to deal with conflict productively (three things necessary in any functional system), they must resort to dysfunctional bargains in order to gather at all. These unspoken agreements come in the form of a meta message. A meta message is nonverbal information conveyed by the group's behavior. This one is common:<BR><BR>""I want to belong in this group, no matter what; therefore, I will put up with any sort of bad behavior from you and the others here. If I do that, you must put up with bad behavior from me. Do this and you will be accepted by me, and vice versa. If anyone points out that we lack either manners or honor, we will band together and call them ""judgmental"".<BR><BR>As my role model Granny Weatherwax likes to say <B><I>""I'm not having it.""</I></B><BR><BR>Any sane person knows the difference between being judgmental and exercising good judgment. A wise Priest or Priestess is, above all, a person of discernment. Such people will not allow mean spirited, discourteous, arrogant, thoughtless, silly, or neurotic behavior to ruin their circles and events. If they do, they need to turn in their wands. Honestly, folks, it is possible to be so open-minded that your brains leak out, and if our ancestors had been this dim witted, we wouldn't be here today. So, here's to common sense and simple courtesy. May they hold an honored place among us. If not, I, for one, will want to know why.<BR><BR><BR><B><FONT color=#000066 size=3>What To Look For (and Avoid) In Pagan Groups &amp; Teachers:</FONT></B><BR><BR>
<CENTER><I>""There are thousands of good reasons why magic doesn't rule the world. They're called Witches and Wizards."" </I><BR>- <B>Terry Pratchett</B></CENTER><BR>I am often asked to give advice about choosing a teacher or joining a circle. I'm a very practical Pagan so I tell newcomers that any Priest/ess worth the name will have their life more or less <B>in balance. </B><BR><BR>As Pagans we understand ""cause and effect"" and we know that these laws operate on a holistic level. We pay attention to our emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual health because we know that imbalance in one area affects the entire system. As we are, so is our practice. Or as the TechnoWitches say: 'Garbage in, garbage out"".<BR><BR>If you are looking for a teacher, you'll want to find someone who enjoys balance, and has the kind of life you someday wish to have. Look at their <I>entire</I> life, not just the bit you see presented at the full moon. If you are looking for a circle, you'll want to consider what sort of energy they project and attract. Ask yourself if you really wish to mix with that energy.<BR><BR><B>Here are some other things to consider when choosing a group or a teacher:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>Is their life harmonious or do they live from crisis to crisis? If their life is in constant chaos, just how good do you think their magick is?<BR><BR>
<LI>Can they sustain healthy relationships? If their emotional life is burdened by resentments, betrayal, abuse, anger or codependency, then what will their relations with others in the group (or their chosen deities) be like?<BR><BR>
<LI>Can they handle money responsibly? If not, what can they teach you about abundance and prosperity? If the group works out of a perpetual ""sense of lack"" or if they fear the responsibility that abundance brings, what sort of energy will they attract? The issue here is not how much money a person makes, but how well they manage their resources.<BR><BR>
<LI>Are they secure in themselves or insecure? Can they share power appropriately or do they have too many control issues? Or, are they the helpless type? If so, they'll want someone to come to their rescue. If they refuse to address the issue of power honestly, the circle will remain unbalanced and out of tune.<BR><BR>
<LI>Are they responsible? Are they someone you can count on? If not, they could let everyone down at the worst possible moment. If they are the classic ""flaky Pagan"" they will be good at avoiding responsibility or they will get others to do the work for them. If you play this game, you are limiting their growth, and hurting yourself.<BR><BR>
<LI>Do they know how to nurture themselves? If not, they will eventually burn out from the Three Pagan Demons: Stress, Mess, and Excess. Since misery loves company, they might resent (or even sabotage) any attempts you make to become happier, healthier, and more balanced.<BR><BR>
<LI>Are they a source of negative or positive energy? If they whine, rage, play the victim/martyr, spread gossip, or complain all the time, you have your answer.<BR><BR>
<LI>Can they communicate well with others? Can they resolve conflicts with fairness and civility? If not, the circle could be rife with unspoken resentments, passive aggressive behavior, and negative energy.<BR><BR>
<LI>Do they have healthy personal boundaries and respect the boundaries of others? If not, the circle is at risk for sexual abuse, codependent enmeshment, and a host of other problems.<BR><BR>
<LI>Do they influence others for better or for worse? Look at their former students and circle members to see if they are actually better for knowing them. Have these people been challenged to change and grow? Are they more insightful, empowered, and happier as a result of their work together or are they stuck in place? Has their spiritual practice deepened and matured over time? If not, why not?<BR><BR>
<LI>Do they treat their practice with the respect it deserves? Check to see if their rituals are chronically late or ill prepared. If so, it is a sign of disrespect towards the circle members and the deities they serve. If your group puts up with this, they might need to do a little less magick, and lot more work on their self-esteem.<BR><BR>
<LI>Are they trustworthy? Don't rely solely on their claims; ask around. Pay less attention to what these people say and a lot more to what they actually do. Remember that trust is not given blindly. Trust must be earned.<BR><BR>
<LI>Are they conscious of their own emotional issues, and working to become healthier, overall? The truth is that we all have emotional burdens to bear. All we can ask of other human beings is that they become aware of their issues and do the necessary work to heal. However, it is not acceptable for circle mates or teachers to inflict their problems on other people. Offering mutual support to each other is a good thing. Asking you to carry their burdens for them is quite another. If they try to engage you in their drama and trauma, walk away.<BR><BR>
<LI>Are they Learners or Posers? Healthy Pagans are willing to learn from others and from their own mistakes. They know the crucial difference between making a mistake and being a mistake. They don't let their ego get in the way of learning. If they ""miss the mark"", they make amends, and move forward bearing new wisdom. Posers only care about looking good, and they love to blame others for their problems. Which sort of person will your God/ess respect?<BR><BR>
<LI>Are they creative? Can they help you to be more creative, as well? Or do they confuse being an artist with being immature? If so, they'll want to be the Artiste with ""the vision"" and have someone else do all the work.<BR><BR>
<LI>Do they know the difference between ""deep play"" and acting out? If not, your rituals will be a lot less about personal expression and divine inspiration, and a lot more like bad theatre.<BR><BR>
<LI>Are they compassionate and kind? If a Priest or Priestess isn't good to their kids or if they neglect any animals in their care, leave that circle immediately. (If you witness actual abuse contact the authorities on your way out the door. Ethically speaking, you may not leave another being in harm's way without trying to do something about it. Take spiritual and legal counsel, if necessary, and proceed with caution, but do the right thing. Who knows? You may have been sent there for just that reason.)<BR><BR>
<LI>Do they honor their word, their partner(s), and their friends? If not, they are asking for a karmic kick in the butt. Get out before that happens. </LI></UL>Trust your gut, and don't do things you aren't comfortable doing. Above all, use good judgment when you seek to learn.<BR><BR>It's important to remember that some people come to Paganism wanting power; power they aren't ready to use, either fairly or well. If they achieve authority among us without having the wisdom to temper their use of power they will then go on to abuse others. If we allow this, we have no one to blame but ourselves.<BR><BR><BR><B><FONT color=#000066 size=3>The Magick Within:</FONT></B><BR><BR>
<CENTER><I>""Freedom is useless if we don't exercise it as characters making choices (and) few things are as encouraging as the realization that things can be different and that we have a role in making them so.""</I> - <B>Daniel Taylor</B></CENTER><BR>It is well known among us that the positive attracts the positive while the negative attracts the negative. The trick is not to find a magickal Circle that will take us in, make us feel special or somehow ""fix"" us. Rather, our challenge is to create our Best Self and to bring that self into Circle with others of like energy, to give as much as we receive.<BR><BR>A healthy Circle is a place in which each person is committed to their Highest Good, to the good of the Circle, and to the community as a whole. So if we want true friends, worthy partners, and magickal rituals, the best way to attract these is to create positive change within. Then we will find the tools we need to make the best possible magick, the kind that works for the good of all.<BR><BR>Wishing you strength, love and laughter, <BR><BR><B><FONT color=#000066 size=2>Sia</FONT></B> <BR><IMG id=MA13893760-0001 height=12 src=""aoladp://MA13893760-0001/gethtml.php"" border=0 DATASIZE=""42"" XWIDTH=""3""><BR>

It's important to remember that real trust is earned and that love is only worthwhile if it is given freely. By the way, if I wanted to set up a system by which naive people are conned, I couldn't ask for a better mantra to give them.

I've been privilege to witness them let go and move forward, choosing to live their lives free of resentments, pain, and fear. On the other hand, I've seen others take a single hit in adulthood and become so bitter and obsessed by it that their very breath infects the air. Not everyone recovers from the harms and shocks of life. Recovery depends, in part; on what kind of support systems, therapy, and medical care we have available to us. It also depends on our willingness to heal. Some survivors of poverty, sexual abuse, and physical abuse rise up to become powerful, loving forces of nature while people with seemingly easier burdens to bear choose not to cope. I am humbled by witnessing the one sort of life, and saddened by the fact of the other. I, myself, am both a particle and a wave; I can be a particle of light on the one hand, or a wave of destruction on the other. I have tried, not always successfully, to choose the path that is positive. I also have a choice, as Priestess, as to which sort of energy I let into my Circle. I would a rather walk my path, side by side, with someone who is struggling, like me, to find the way, then try and carry another person will not walk on their own two feet.<BR><BR>(7) Some exceptions to this lack of any real Pagan community can be found among a small number of well-run Pagan festivals, groups and events, often as not, among the dedicated volunteers.

<lj-cut>
I am pleased to see it discusses the various aspects of addiction, including sex addiction, and regards relationship and commitment as necessary components of SOUL based sexual relationship.  Regards impersonal sex as a form of addiction, something people do to replace core needs.  (I agree completely on this one.)
 
(p. 163)
""...Our world reflects the basic thought form that there is no afterlife, that in this lifetime the only thing that insures power is what can be had and gained. Sometimes we speak of an afterlife, but we do not really believe that...or your choices would be very different...
     ""Our species is no longer humble.  It has no reverence.  It is arrogant & filled with its own technology...""
 
(p. 166)
""...you put your partnership most at risk by avoiding that which you are most afraid will destroy it...  You learn that sharing your concerns with consideration & the intention to heal & trust in the process is the only appropriate avenue...
...the true human condition in its most perfect form has no secrets.  It does not hide, but exists in clear love...""
 
P. 183-184
Talks about other dimensions --- goes from talking about Angels to ""disincarnate spirits.""  (Ghosts.)  ""...Earthbound, within the Earth's auric field.""  [Not evil, but negative, encourages negativity] ""...[by the] law of attraction... their own energy is drawn to like forces of energy, or like forces of weakness... these spirits can create additional negative karma by pursuing malevolence...""
 
(p. 184)
""The...Earth... is set up... with free will, choice, placed between faith & doubt, good & evil, between the... dualisms... our species has created...""
 
(p. 185)
""...There are numerous... realms of nonphysical life...""
 
I actually think I ""know"" what they're talking about.  It seems to be one characteristic of Pagan culture to go in pursuit of relationship with non-physical beings.  I occasionally pick up a 'how to' book that SOUNDS like a primer on becoming schizophrenic --- persuading the reader to a mental readiness to find and respond to other dimensions that, frankly, sounds like a means to ESCAPE one's life rather than master one.  A great deal of arrogance goes into the accomplishment, but these non-physical beings don't seem to be helpful, really.  I don't go there --- I have a brother in prison whose evolution has included periods when he seemed to be in relationship with unhelpful 'ghosts,' so I contemplate this without exploring it personally.
 
I feel I personally DO have a ""Guardian Angel"" or ""Spirit Guides,"" and I feel they are NOT earthbound ghosts, or 'misery-seeking-misery' types.  They fit the books description of beings of a much higher state of evolution, light-filled, etc.  I tend to get significant results when I respond to guidance, when engaged in a kind of 'dialogue' with a helper...
 
(p. 193)
""...Psychology is the study of cognitions, perceptions... the PERSONALITY.""  (Caps are mine.)  ""...it is not able to recognize the soul..""
 
(p. 195)
""...The fears, [etc]... that deform the personality cannot be understood apart from the karmic circumstances... they serve... the experiences of your life are necessary to the balancing of the energy of your soul...  
...by consciously serving the evolution of your soul you contribute the most that you can to your world...  if you are negligent of yourself you will be that to others...""
 
(p. 196)
""Individuals [with] ... martyr attitude... the love... they give is contaminated because it is so filled with sorrow for themselves...""

I am not fond of the esteem we put on martyring in this culture.  I feel like anything we do at our own expense, that essentially demoralizes us, or otherwise does us damage, just seems wrong.  However, ""pain"" and suffering is often part of a GOOD thing, like mastering a new discipline, or giving birth.  And actions/events have a short and long term effect.  The labor of giving birth is horribly painful.  And love-based relationships are full of tormented experiences, unearthing primitive feelings from primal wounds...  I wouldn't judge either of them as 'negative' just because they are correlated with painful experiences.

I also don't like the value judgement the author repeatedly puts on different feelings, with tons of emphasis on 'light' and speed...  The author seems especially intent on getting through the business of life with SPEED --- as though the key to maintaining 'goodness' is to run through as superficially and charismatically as possible. 

I am grateful to my husband, even though he seems quite the 'martyr,' working to support this family at a job he hates, I hate watching how much he sacrifices.  However, he is also NOT SHALLOW --- the ""martyring"" really does express the depth of his love and devotion.  I am not so ""in love"" with happy/pleasant things I can't see the merits of really-really GIVING of oneself in service.  
 
The book goes into describing the concept of SPIRITUAL PSYCHOLOGY.  (Caps mine.)
 
(p. 197)
""... Re-incarnation & the role of karma in the developement of the soul will be central...""
 
(p. 199)
""...The exploration & understanding of intuition will be a central part of spiritual psychology...  Intuition is the voice of the nonphysical world... it... releases the 5-sensory personality from the limitations of its 5-sensory system...  the connection between the personality & its higher self & its guides and teachers...""
 
(p. 200)
""Spirituality will be at the core of spiritual psychology... and will trace... the functional relationships between Karma, reincarnation, intuition, & spirituality...
""Spiritual psychology is a disciplined & systematic study of what is necessary to the health of the soul.  It will identify behaviors that operate in opposition to harmony & wholeness...[and] ... to the energy of the soul... [also identfying forms & effects of negativity.]
""Anything that increases separation within a person shatters the soul...""
""The soul cannot tolerate brutality... abundance of pain & irrationality... being lied to... non-forgiveness... jealousies & hatreds... These are contaminants, poisons for it...""
 
(p. 202)
""...Let us not run away from the unattractiveness of a shattered soul...

""...If you are unaware & deny... any level of higher wisdom... to your life, then the guidance must come through the density of physical event... through crisis...""
 
(p. 203)
Defines CRISIS and its function:
""...the awakening of the personality to the potential of the soul has come to require the loss of a mate, or... death of... a child, or... collapse of... business, or some situation that renders the individual powerless... the failure of external power... That, to the 5-sensory personality, is crisis...""
 
Okay, I take a certain issue with that line of thinking.  On the one hand, I have been extremely frustrated with certain individuals close to me who make fear their main ""God,"" making most decisions around the avoidance of pain, so there is an inevitability that PAIN HAS to be their teacher --- okay, in that regards, geeze it would help so very much if LOVE and VISION were the 'higher callings' of these people's lives.
 
On the one hand.
 
On the other hand, EXPERIENCE, to me, is the TRUEST teacher, and I don't feel like scorning those of us who esteem 'hard knock' know-how over 'lofty-looker' or 'ivory-tower' type ""wisdom.""  I think we are on this earth with these BODIES OF FLESH, and PERSONALITIES that are vulnerable & self-conscious --- as our TOOLS.  I think we're SUPPOSED to experiment around, and fumble --- some of our best lessons come through fumbling, and this implied 'superiority' for those so extremely 'intuitively advanced' they don't require crisis nor illness to teach them..... Ummmm.... I knew everything BEFORE I ever did it, too.  I was superior to just about everyone I knew, ESPECIALLY my Mom, when I was 16 years old.  My ""intuition"" told me so.
 
Sometimes ""intuition"" is just narcissistic wishful thinking.
 
I don't like this author's inclination to sorta ""map"" how to be superior.  I see lots of tools for one 'follower' to use against another 'follower' to stratify each other's credibility, based on superficialities and words-words-words.  And the ""winner"" seems to be the person most alone, wrapped up and nurtured primarily by thought or 'spiritually transcendant' analysis, using all these lovely concepts most eloquently.
 
I prefer reading Sam Keen or David Whyte.  They give me pearls of insight while also letting me see them as mortal, dimensional, fallible fellow-beings, and NOT like they're talking out of a cloud and carving 'truth' with lightening bolts into stone.  They offer notions and include examples that lend nicely to discussion.  
 
I am afraid of discussing this book with anybody from the Shamanic class because I am afraid they are more inclined to take written things like this as gospel.  It doesn't help the author himself treats these OPINIONS like 'gospel.' 
 
So I am enjoying 'pearls' and feeling a 'trap' descending on me at the same time...
 
Okay, so can I summarize the book, in terms of what I liked, and didn't like?
 
What I liked:
---It had an immediate effect on me, like an alarm clock going off, the 'true' elements to this book are VERY true, VERY elemental to what I think, how I navigate the world.
---I do believe in putting my commitment to my soul growth ahead of my 'rank' in this mortal world, money-or-position-wise.  And I DO regard a LOT of what is most esteemed in this world as being the ANTITHESIS of what a person really needs.  And, in that context, I treat it like ""illusion"" or something so transient, it's not worth depending on or accomodating in permanent ways.
---I like the idea of being more mindful of the intentions I carry behind any action I take.  However, ( and this is a 'negative' fault-finder), I don't feel I am singlehandedly responsible for the outcome of all relationships, or that I should infuse ""love"" in all contacts.  I think obsessing on being ""good,"" and under moral obligation to be ""loving"" is something others can detect, and cynically exploit.  I also think being 'good' to become more evolved is selfishly motivated, lacks the substance of real compassion, and that selfish agenda will backfire.  I do, however, (back to postive, after the modifier), think I could learn a lot about how to assert boundaries without passing my hurt or insult directly back to the source, punishing them in swift words and deeds.  I tend to lose more than I realized, and to discover I cared more than I thought, and I would rather remember that I CARE first, and WATCH MY INTENTIONS contained in actions chosen.
---I agree that love IS the 'answer,' simply, and that prayer is an excellent and powerful way to access spiritual guideance, answers, etc.  But I think 'prayer' takes many forms, and may be better known or experienced through music, art, dance...  (Once again, the author made a statement, ""only through prayer,"" that was too flat, too specific, and I need to add modifiers.)
 
 
What I didn't like:
---The book is laced with 'dos and don'ts and assorted stratifiers, plus some things that dutifully reverse what he's said/implied, so the value judgements he makes he also pointedly DOESN'T make, 'cause he validates the 'slow' way, but, geeze, it feels like he's really basically quite competitive --- more interested in dominance than relationship --- talks forgiveness and compassion, but I honestly don't FEEL anything but a ton of flat guidance and judgement from the tone.
---The book both inspires me, and heightens my paranoia, my inclination to want to master his language if only to 'cover my ass' (defend the credibility of my choices) in the face of some other 'enlightened' reader.
---The book talks of both destiny and free choice.  We supposedly 'wrote' in a book of life, before birth, what we wanted to work on in this lifetime.  But it also indicates we have lots of options on how to learn -- through hardship, or through proactive LOVE.
My problem with this has to do with how this kinda sets up blame, isolates the individual as though context of family, community, culture, etc. are a 'given' that is our karmic destiny, just deserts, and his premsies on 'how it all works' could serve for a lot of stuff sick people to convolute and pass accountibility on.  I have heard some pretty convoluted thinking by 'mystic' types, especially when trying to integrate past life stories into making sense of current issues, destiny, etc.  I really-really think we are accountible first to those who are alive and directly impacted by our actions here-and-now, no matter how mystified we or they are by past incarnation karmic baggage or whatever.  
---The book also says we're not capable of understanding the cause, and therfore solution, to our hardships without knowing about our past lives...  I disagree.  I believe people can evolve without knowing much about how present circumstances correlate with past circumstances, and, in fact, too much ""knowledge"" will actually get in the way.

This is what I think, really, regarding the hardships we face:
Some of it may be karmic or 'energy field attraction,' some of it might be 'luck of the draw,' but the really important issue is: whatever bothers YOU becomes YOUR responsibility to change or heal, and to find meaning or the 'lesson' within.  

I think that, while we are part of the 'infinite,' ONE task we have as individuals is to become conscious of ourselves as individuals, to find ways to observe, discipline, shield, and direct our energies or 'soul' center to improve, (strengthen, deepen) ourselves.  (I said ""one"" task because I am naming only that one, but there are many others.)

OTHER tasks include some social responsibility to move our collective state of evolution forward, too.  I think we are more than individuals with individual 'karma,' that we also have collective 'karma' work to do.

It is not fair to say ""your attitudes and karma attract everything that happens to you.""  We are not, on this earth, all equally empowered, evolved, etc.  There are inherent dependencies that oblige community, and offer 'tests,' that are NOT inevitable.  Children are dependant on their caretakers.  If someone abuses that trust, that is NOT the child's fault, and I take great offense at anyone saying the CHILD ""wrote in his book of life"" he CHOSE that experience.  At WORST it might be speculated that the child was so devoted to that parent or other person in spirit, he/she was willing to TRUST.  

Here's what I notice.  

Premise: there is 'rational' 5-sensory perspective, and then there is ""multi-sensory perspective.  The significant difference is to include INTUITION and SPIRIT GUIDES as one source, or PRIMARY source.

The CHILD perspective is EXTEMELY intuitive, but it is also very self-centered, and 'magical' in its thinking.  Children believe in things unseen they can imagine, like Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.  They also believe themselves the center of the universe, and 'cause' of all things.  Children are perfectly willing to believe they 'cause' their parents' divorce.  

I think it ought to be possible to be ""born again"" or ""become as a child"" again without becoming narcissistically the source of all things, including hardship that hurts us. 

I think it's natural and good we evolve from 'magic-minded' children into 'rational' 5-sensory perspective adults.  I think it's a good coping strategy, if nothing else.  Children are extremely abused because of their need and willingness to trust, to have the ongoing readiness to share other people's feelings, to have such thin boundaries...  I think to stay like a child is to become overwhelmed with subconscious scripts, to be a landfill of emotional debris.  We NEED to get rational and selective to survive, to evolve.

I think that ""intuition"" without rational thought is a dangerous thing for the individual.  

I think, while we resolve to reclaim some of our original 'genius' intuition, we should also really respect RATIONAL thought.

When an author treats 'rational' thought as wrong, that we should believe the vision, what the mind can create, what the heart wants to attract --- to hold that above what we rationally know through sight, touch, first-hand experience memory...  Well, it feels like the author is priming the public to be easily exploited.  It feels like what a predator wolf does to sheep.

I like to follow my heart, but my heart is still interested in what my brain has to say.  I believe in a PARTNERSHIP of perspectives.  I disagree with a LOT of the value judgements the author puts on what is tangibly real, calling it ILLUSION.  
 
I can summarize by saying the book is powerful, and valuable, but lacks balance, and could easily become a sourcebook for power-games to maneuver/pollute in spiritual realms with ego and personality as central 'gods,' not SOUL at all.

If I wrote this book, I would be revising it ASAP, for fear of what damage it may cause, in the 'wrong' hands.

""...love heals everything, & love is all there is...""
     ""Our cycles of creation:

(p. 127)
""...when you choose to align yourself with your soul instead of your personality...[your reality will reflect your soul more than your personality.]... What you intend becomes your reality...""
Summarizing p. 128 - 129: Look for the LIGHT, in yourself, in others --- where you put your attention is what grows.
(p. 130-131)
""...The dynamic of soul & personality is the same dynamic as energy converted into matter.  Your personality is the energy of your soul converted to matter... If it is aware, it begins to become whole... [It] lies at the heart of our creation mythology, the story of Paradise...with the Tree representing your personal energy system [or] cord of knowledge... Will you create with reverence, or with neglect?""
   On first reading I flashed on my own struggles periodically getting 'cast out.'  However, I am intent on being WHOLE and confronting, IMO, manifestations of 'the devil', to be seduced to abandon soul, to conform, to stop questioning & start aligning with reality.  So, in THAT way, I tend to re-enact BIRTH for myself periodically.  I am sorta trying to graduate.
     This is something to ponder, for sure.
(p. 135-136)
This part makes the point that silence or action, BOTH, can be 'right' or 'wrong, depending on the INTENTION behind the action.
(p. 138)
Points out we need to consciously ""...choose which parts of yourself you want to cultivate, and which parts you want to release...""

OKAY, my reaction to these readings:
ULTIMATELY I want to be BALANCED.  I want to be a nurturing leader, and ethical 'star,' subliminal AND overt.  It FEELS like my hunger for attention and respect is offensive because I am FEMALE, & I am FORCED to sublimate my strength and energies into service, to live vicariously through others.  I exercise a certain defiance by focussing my ""nurturing energies"" on the ""victim,"" the NON-leader, the men most rejected/ oppressed in the world.  I am angry with ""successful"" types & judge them parasites, predators, gaining at the expense of others.  I ""nurture"" by teaching certain values, a certain 'biased' way of appraising things, hoping the love foundation they carry into the world will effect change, healing, etc.

But there IS a good deal of judgement, bias, etc. in what I teach/ infuse in this family.

It has been MY experience that to aspire to be LOVING, to vigilantly be universally ""loving"" --- is to lose all personal definition, to be vulnerable to my own resolve, my own ""should"" becomes how others exploit, manipulate, or exhaust me.  A person is a PERSON, NOT!! a ""God"" --- you may VISIT ""divine awareness"" from time to time, but you CANNOT LIVE there --- without ENDANGERING yourself.  You must define & defend yourself, & assert boundaries.

</lj-cut>

All of that was copied straight from my written journal.  <lj-cut>Seeing it, I think maybe the biggest difference between me & VTravel is this summary.  I think, when he aspires to transcend, he ""loves"" without boundaries, and the lowest of types, hungriest of types, is deeply attracted to him.  In their company, he loses his virtue because he ""loves and understands"" without judgment to the point of sharing their problems.  

This book is not teaching good ego definition, but I think that is a spiritual necessity --- for as long as we walk this earth in flesh form, we need boundaries and an 'entitlement' to pass judgement, to choose...</lj-cut>"

(p. 80)
CAPS ARE MINE:
""...From the multisensory [perspective]. insights, intuitions, hunches, & inspirations are messages from the soul on its evolutionary journey.  The multisensory personality therefor HONORS intuition in a way that [others do not.]  (p.81) ...they are promptings from, & links to a perspective of greater comprehension & compassion than its own... ...only through emotions can you encounter the force field of your own soul...""
(p. 82)
""...Every time you ask for guidance, you receive it...  You may not always [hear] the answers... and [they] may not come [as] you expect, but they always come... a feeling... a memory... a [random thought]... a dream...""  
(p.84) 
""...there [are] techniques to engage & discipline intuition...""
#1:
""...HONOR EMOTIONAL CLEANSING AT ALL TIMES... [open] your intuitive track because [it gives] you a CLEAR SENSE OF LOVING... [Opening the intuitive track]... brings you closer to unconditional love & renders you harmless...  ...CLEAR YOURSELF EACH DAY OF YOUR EMOTIONAL IMPACTS... by finishing emotionally unfinished business, by not going to bed [angry], ...and...honor your emotional currents of energy...""
#2:
[Is]...""a CLEANSING NUTRITIONAL PROGRAM.""
#3:
""...honor the guidance... you receive...""
#4:
""...allow yourself an orientation of openness toward your life & the Universe... with a sense of faith... there is a reason for all that is happening...& [it] is always compassionate & good...""

Okay, time for 'discussion.  I have reactions to these quotes... 

I can give my thoughts numbers, too.
1) I absolutely agree the five sense are not enough, we don't get anywhere in terms of our SOUL EVOLUTION, without going beyond the tangible logic of those five senses.

2)  I agree with the first two 'rules' absolutely, and the 2nd two are more complicated.  I DO believe that the emotions are, in some way, the language of the soul.  Some quote was ""LAUGHTER is the language of the soul,"" (Pueblo somebody?) but I think the feelings that spring from the heart include laughter, but are not exclusively laughter.  (Although I rank laughter very-very high on the scale of healing strategy, sometimes laughter is so derisive, or so cynical, it becomes just another wall, in which case, TEARS are the healing emotion maybe more sacred...)  Anyway, YES, the issues and callings of the heart are CENTRAL to being 'connected' --- I believe that completely.

3)  I thought it a tad weird that #2 & #3 of the book's list of rules were barely a paragraph each.  #2 was essentially a sentence.  Might as well had said, ""Take care of your health.""  Ummmm  SURE THINK THAT TOPIC DESERVES MORE DEVELOPMENT.  I am aware that most religious communities incorporate special dietary disciplines, what to eat, what not to eat, how to prepare it, if/when to fast, if/when to feast, etc.  I'm SURE the things we put INTO our bodies, do TO our bodies, and have our bodies DO --- all are really-really significant to healing.  The book is inadaquate on the subject so far.

4)  I am 'good' with #3, saying ""honor the guidance you receive,"" but am also aware that I have more than one 'voice' offering me guidance a lot of the time, and each speaks with a similarly strong climate of 'authority.'
Sometimes I frame it this way, ""I want to honor my feelings.""  Meaning: it doesn't matter if the other person is being kind or loving me in return.  I feel love, I need to express it, I don't need to make SENSE, I need to be REAL.  Feelings really aren't anything you can dictate into submission with your brain.
Again, #3 'rule' was too under-developed, so far, in the book.

5)  Allow yourself an openness to the universe, blah-blah, all things are good, blah-blah.

Ummmm, this is why children and young people get all the attention, and older people get relegated to the sidelines.  Young people are 'fresh' and open, (gullible), and we older people are full of noisy opinions and a disinterest in just following directions in trust.

I do know that IF I really ""KNEW"" so much, why am I so stuck?  That there is some merit to the notion of taking an attitude of openness, willingness to listen, to be wrong, to change something, blah-blah.  

But, see, there is also the fact that failure and loss leaves a residue of HURT.  It HURTS to be old, to have accumulated a lot of experiences that weren't what we WANTED, etc.  It is NATURAL to want to, hmmm, DISCUSS the 'advise/guidance' we are receiving, instead of just ACCEPT it at face value like we did as children, (because, golly gee, teachers, parents, ministers, and therapists never ABUSE their power and MISLEAD people, do they?)

Yeah...

I also remember some of the notions that came to me as a teen, when on a similar path of really very respectworthy HEALING.  I was ON this 35 years ago --- working on bringing my feelings/baggage up-to-date, or unloaded/released, working on my physical health & vitality, working on my attitude.... I was THERE!

And I ACCOMPLISHED A GREAT DEAL by those basic tools, too.

I made some committments to myself at the ripe old age of 16 I didn't entirely fullfill, but I carried them a certain distance, and have been influenced by the intent or desire, if not the accomplishment.

I lost all excess weight.  I attained great fitness.  I was fluid socially --- able to carry myself in all kinds of cliches with equal welcome.  I had named some horrible issues I'd carried for years, written them down for a teen magazine advise columnist, and I, alone, confronted my 'primary' perpetrator --- essentially resulted in driving him out of my life in a state of distress, having lost his power over me, and his facade, together...  I was heavily into a constant dialogue with ""God,"" and praying.  I was convinced everything pivotted around doing/being nothing but good, to make every action an expression of love, to take my need and hurt to God, and to conduct myself as 'selfless servant' to God in the world.  (Gratitude for restoring my loveableness, giving me guidance, hope, popularity.)  I had 'guidance' that prompted me to study fairy tales and Disney music, speculating my future was in writing for whimsical-yet-deep meaning, music or stories.  I weighed 110#, and looked like a very innocent, pure child.  (Teen-sweet-sexy-childlike.)

I harbored notions that I should conduct myself like some sort of 'Jesus,' no longer mortal, but like an angel on earth.  I believed little 'divine' messages, like the notion I was in my family to bring my family healing, and that the illness would be realigned when Mom & Dad's relationship was reunited.

This lovely 'soul voice' of mine, brought to me by these same disciplines, the emotional connectedness, keeping my issues fresh and my attitude young, and my health prime like a cute-dainty athlete --- with all these refinements, this SOUL VOICE said healing would come when Mom & Dad realized they still loved each other, that all the hate and bitterness was about love, the opposite of love is not hate but apathy, they were disturbed because they were not in harmony with this truth, blah-blah...

The summer I had this ""born again"" realization was the most pivotal and brutal summer of my life.  The more I virtuously martyred, the worse things got.  

Anyway, I can cut to the chase and say these ""shoulds"" create imbalance.  A really PURE spirit becomes a vacume for TOXINS to come RACING in.  

This is my biggest issue with 'formula' spiritual guidance.  Especially from a book, but possibly also from communities.  I had a similar roller-coaster result from my very devoted effort to make UNITY teachings work for me some years ago.  They SOUND right, but, for some reason, they DON'T PLAY OUT RIGHT.

I am not dissing the whole book, ""The Seat of the Soul,"" --- I am just putting up a few orange cones around familiar messages I've ""openly"" accepted before.  Not gonna be that OPEN this time.

Previous post on this subject:
http://www.livejournal.com/users/spencer_diehard/428392.html#cutid1

I am not always comfortable with the author's approach to persuasion, to be wary of attracting 'bad karma,' and the 'judgement' he passes on the habit of 'passing judgement,' and the impression that we can find our way to deep feelings by way of policing the shit out of the correctness of the terms we use.  However...

However, there is a 'core' merit to the book's message, I think.  I keep getting hooked with things I already know, but there they are in print, anchoring me.

Here's some of those gems:
P. 60:
""...As we...seek external power, we come to view feelings as unneccesary appendages, like tonsils --- useless, but capable of creating pain and dysfunction.  Thus, the pursuit of external power has led to a repression of emotion...""

Yeah, definitely, it seems like a person could ""advance"" a lot faster in this world if the emotions would just shut the fuck up, and only our logical, 5-sensory brain was doing all the planning.  Which is, unfortunately, IMO, the 'goal' of modern 'therapeutic treatment.'  Medication.  Shut up those feelings.  Lets all be robots.  Deeply addicted robots.

But here's some more gems:
""If you strike without compassion against the darkness, you yourself enter the darkness.""
ALSO:
""A compassionate heart is more effective against evil than an army.""
""...examine the choices that you make each moment in terms of whether they move you toward Light or away from it...""

Okay, for me, these little flecks of golden insight might get me somewhere.  

Over-all the 'thrust' of the book is to listen to the heart, to be attentive to our feelings, etc., and to make choices out of love.

To a huge extent, I am 'right there,' and always have been.  I have this ""inner child"" who appraises the world entirely according to ""how does it make me feel?"" and badgers me until I make gestures in that direction.  My inner child is not attracted to perverse or cynical things.  I can barely sit through 'typical' levels of sex and violence on TV.  I like educational or history channels, and uplifting things like musicals.  

Ummm... I am not entirely 'reformed' by the 'judgement-against-making-judgements' specifics/details of this book, but I choose to back up, and see if the 'big picture' it spells out won't naturally realign some of my 'attachments' to darker side, like, well, to be ANGRY and CONFRONTIVE seems to be my favorite ATTACK against FEAR and watching ADDICTION suck the SOUL of people I CARE about. 

Examples:
I was never able to persuade Mom not to smoke.  I think I knew my entire life it would eventually take hers; I never gave her any 'peace.' ""Why do you smoke?"" I confronted.  ""Too green to burn,"" she quipped, in retort.

The book is persuading compassion/love as a means to confront the dark.  So, I guess, if I REALLY wanted to know WHY she smoked, I wouldn't phrase it as a rheutorical, judgemental question, and really ponder that.  Smoking kept her steady.  Smoking kept her facade intact.  Without the cigarette, she gained weight and felt inside-out exposed.

Dito on my recent melodrama in reaction to realizing a former friend of mine was regressing to pre-2nd-marriage behavior, the kind of stuff that unravelled her character and judgement when she was young...  That deep hunger to be assured she's desireable, important, sought-after...  

I wasn't particularly compassionate.  Love was behind how rashly I responded, but part of that was for my own survival, since, psychologically, I 'leaned' on her, or looked to her as a 'solid' dependable friend in the Pagan community.  

When I remember how much she is like my own daughter, both Taurus, I feel remorse.  Not for the depth of my angst, but for insulting and trying to frighten her into realignment.  

My anger is usually born out of love, but it doesn't get phrased in ways that make people FEEL the LOVE.

I like this book --- in spite of small annoyances --- it may be one of the things that will finally?  Maybe?  Get me on the right track, aligned right...

Just started new book --- from the book list from the Shamanic class I'm taking Sundays.  ""The Seat of the Soul.""

Gonna post notes here to contemplate...

Compares 5-sensory modality to multi-sensory modality.

""...When the physical world is limited to the 5-sensory modality, the basis of life in the physical arena is fear.  Power to control ...[others]...appears to be essential."" (p.22)

""...The perception of power as external splinters the psyche, whether it is the psyche of the individual... or the world.  There is no difference between acute schizophrenia and a world at war..."" (p. 25.)

""...the insecurity which underlies the perception of power as external cannot be healed by the accumulation of external power...""  (p. 26.)

That part stops me dead in my tracks.
I have been feeling a huge split for a really long time between my own internal power, and my 'power' or membership in the world.  I have not been able to persuade more ""membership"" in the world by way of having more focus, mindfulness, self-awareness, INTERNAL power.  I have some link to inspiration that feeds me constantly, and helps me 'feed' the family, but the WORLD wants to see measureable credentials, and individuals line up to see what sort of service-pawn I am, how to exploit my resources for the least pay possible.  

I have sorta sequestered myself away, not surrendering the sovereign I have over myself, my own ""internal power,"" but not seeing any way to infiltrate and do MEANINGFUL work in the world without some form of acknowledged POWER, like MONEY.  (I am shy of standards credentials, like degrees, because they involve getting heavily indoctrinated by largely patriarchal systems, and are skewed to be measureable/flat, instead of creative/unlimited.)

In any case, ongoing fantasy to win a lottery --- THIS book says, THAT WILL FAIL: ""...the insecurity which underlies the perception of power as external cannot be healed by the accumulation of external power...""

The book also says 'authentic power makes no judgements.'  

I have trouble swallowing that.  That is, essentially, the attitude of children and dogs, and their total trust and lack of judgement makes them extremely vulnerable to abuse.

I mean, from a lofty place between your ears, contemplating, sure, you can refrain from 'judging.'  But the minute you step outdoors?  How's the weather, traffic, terraine, community, etc... 

I need to read more.  See if they can integrate some of this lofty talk with concrete, practical examples.  Otherwise, I have just found another 'air castle' to live in for the duration of the book...

Tonight's Discovery Channel topic was domestic robots.  My brother had a small segment midway about his company, and the assistive robots they market --- one featured briefly was ""Emily.""  They featured how personable she was, telling someone what was on TV that night, and also telling a joke.  ""Why does a bee have sticky hair?  Because of his honey comb.""

What is it about my family and corny jokes?  Mom did that to all three of us, apparently.  We have a compulsion to make personality our biggest product...  (I didn't know MARTIN harbored that side to himself, but I know Troy and I can't cope without interludes of humor...)  

Anyway, we taped it, so we have record of my brother's 15 minutes of 'fame.'  </lj-cut>"

Do you notice the streak of light in this second photo, behind her?
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v315/kcsongwriter/MVC00002.jpg"">
Poochy perceives that to be a ghost.

Her room actually has a history.  She has the ""Master Bedroom"" to herself.  Once upon a time, this was her parents' room.  (Hubbyone and me.)  Hubbyone became quite disturbed, difficult to be emotionally close to, especially in his sleep, so I moved out.

I recently have been reading through old journals, and observed the room had a ""4 a.m. wake-up"" climate history to it.  I'd moved to a different room, and Hubbyone was reporting waking at 4 a.m., with ""palpatations.""  I traded beds one night, and I, too, reported in my journal, 4 a.m. ""palpatations.""

On one of his stays at the hospital, I switched our bedrooms, putting myself in the Master bedroom, and moving him out.  It didn't really ""remove"" all of his distress.

I took the Master bedroom -- sooner or later it became a shared bedroom with Poochy.  Bunk beds.  IMO, we slept fine.  Poochy has never liked being the only girl/daughter, never liked sleeping alone, so we were roommates.

When she got older, though, she quit wanting to share a room with me.  So I moved out a year or so ago.

There was so much turmoil in our lives when the ""4 a.m."" wake-up thing with that bedroom was observed, so many years ago, I'd forgotten.  I wouldn't have remembered, either, if I hadn't been reading OLD journal posts.

I had thought, maybe, my presence in the bedroom had disenchanted or subdued whatever 'negative' energies might be lingering there.  (I dabble in meditative, occultish, ""witchy"" things sometimes, 'cleansing' with incense, etc.)

But Poochy had commented the other day -- waking for 'no good reason' at 4 a.m., & I remembered reading that in old journals.

I know a little history on this home. We've been here 14 years.

Before us, the Browns lived here.  They were truckers, or owned trucks --- covered the yard in trucks, in any case, and kept foster children, specifically teen girls.  Then it was discovered the father was sexually abusing his foster daughters, and that ended that.  Along that same season of legal issues, I THINK, (if the neighbor across the street told me correctly), this house burned down.  

Some investors bought the place and basically had to rebuild it, almost completely.  When we arrived, it had ""new"" everything feel.  (Carpet, walls, kitchen, bathrooms...)  Only thing ""dated"" were the trees/landscaping, and the architectural style.

My THEORY about the 4 a.m. wake-up was about the probability that was a routine time for someone to get abused, due to work schedule, ideal privacy opportunity, that sort of thing.  Master bedroom heartache imbued in the walls.

Now, to Poochy, she has photographed a ghost...

I don't know.  I asked her how she wanted to respond.  I told her only very recently I did a 'spell' on this property to clear out negativity, and permanently protect us from harmful energies. 

So far, her only response was to eagerly post the photos on my journal.  She is 14.  Maybe she wants a ghost to talk about with her friends?

<DIV>Andrew is angling to hurt my self esteem.&nbsp; That has been the confusing grain in your communications, also.&nbsp; You try to get maximum help, my 'rescue' energies, but when you don't feel loved enough, or restored enough, or... </DIV>

"event","Just the three of us, Hubbyone, Artstar, and myself went.  The route there we took through Iowa, and the route back we went through St. Louis.  <lj-cut>

Since we just got through performing Music Man, about Iowa City, Iowa, in 1918, the route through Iowa felt like a 'pilgramage.'  (The song, ""Iowa Stubborn,"" lists these towns, going up the scale, at the end, ""Debuke, DesMoines, Marshaltown, Mason City, Keokuk, Aimes, Clearlake, You ought to give Iowa a try!""  There we were, giving Iowa a try.  Didn't realize it until we were doing it, but it kinda contributed to ""Music Man"" bonding closure needs...

We arrived at Artstar's college ""campus,"" downtown Chicago, around 9 p.m.  The streets were THICK with people, especially young people.  I mean, carnival-thick.  Easily we saw 100 people at-a-glance.  On a Tuesday night, people.

The city literally vibrated.  I couldn't be more amazed if I'd been taken to some place in Europe. 

The college is an assortment of highrise, old-model buildings within a few blocks of each other, mingled with other colleges, restaurants, taverns, rescue mission with ""Jesus Saves"" cross flashing neon, parking garages, theatres, convenience store, museums, book publishing companies, parks with HUGE, I mean SKY-rocketting FOUNTAIN, and Jesus, WHAT A PLACE!

The ""dorm"" we were lodged in was an experience like none other.  Felt like the kind of extremely dated architecture you see in old, black-and-white movies.  Our 'suite' had extremely high ceilings, and these windows up high-high --- obviously a design that was popular before air conditioning, to encourage air to circulate...  Our view of the street was ""Jesus Saves.""  

The impression is: there is no seperation between the colleges and the cultural core of Chicago.  We are ""one.""

Columbia College has 10,000 students.  It boasts being the largest Arts and Media college in the country, maybe the world.  A speaker at orientation called it a ""Cultural Candy Store.""  I think that was very well summarized.

Artstar's major is film animation, but he is welcome to be involved in other fields, audition for plays, etc.  Cultural Candy Store --- forums for expression are hosted all over the place with open mikes, galleries, etc.

And, get this.  All classes are limited to 15 or fewer students...

10,000 students getting classrooms of 15 or fewer per teacher...

(And police and security guards are everywhere.  Police on bikes, and police on horseback... With the quaint-cute trollies, and the overhead trains?  Feels like a theme park...)

Artstar is also thrilled with his class plan.  Gonna take courses directly related to his dream, animation.  Gonna be made into a true 'professional' in his field.

Oh, and here's an extra-special ""fringe benefit"" for Artstar.  It APPEARS 100% of male teaching or administrative staff are GAY. (That was our impression at each phase of orientation.  He who speaks or assists somehow 'glows' gay.) It would APPEAR heterosexual males at that school are a minority...

If the male students are similarly skewed, Artstar has a HUGE population of FEMALE students accessible for romantic possibilities...  

That's a plus for Artstar. 

Artstar insisted on doing most of the driving there and back, just to acquaint himself with the path, and skills needed to maneuver.  It was reasonably easy to get to his school, but downtown Chicago is so thick with pedestrians, it would be best to depend mostly on mass transit to get around.  They have some sort of student pass thing that gets students on bus and train for free --- he will receive early this semester.  He already got his student ID card.  (Yeah!)

We left Chicago late afternoon Wednesday, and stopped for the night in Springfield, Illinois.  We really-really needed that break.  We were soooo tired.  It was much better to wake fully rested, etc. to finish the trip home yesterday...

Way too much experience was packed into too short a time this week.  Kinda overwhelming.

Homecoming was a bit of a roller-coaster.  Artstar and Bean2 'clashed' almost instantly over nothing.  (Fatigue-boy versus lonely-hungry boy?)  Bean2 did a lousy job of feeding himself while we were gone, so we went out to eat as a family, to rekindle, catch-up, etc.

Bean2 auditioned for another Blue Springs Community Theatre play while we were gone: ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.""  Bean2 is a wolf.  Someone 'evil' who works for the witch, and gets killed.  He is pleased: he gets to fight, and die, on stage.

But, to summarize our trip to Chicago ---

Most of the way home, I was busy revising my fantasy of what to do if/when I win a Powerball Lottery, and have money-money-money...

I was wishing I could go to this college, too, and live in that ""Cultural Candy Store"" for a couple years, too, and maybe have the whole family there, but living in the 'contained' supervised/supported structure of college ""campus"" life.

I can't imagine anybody saying ""can't"" or ""you're not qualified"" to anybody's dreams, there... Seems like the perfect place to really-really be ""born,"" creatively...

Artstar was pleased at how much I envied and approved of his choice.  (He also agrees: the latent talents of his parents and family deserve this level of foundation and support.)


It really did feel like a great place to heal deeply, and ""remake"" myself, or ""liberate"" some realm of 'divine-ideal' in me/us.  Dream central.  </lj-cut>"

Chicago was quite an adventure.  The Columbia College is a dream-come-true place for Artstar to attend.  Lots of stuff on my mind... Probably post tomorrow or later about it."

"event","I really believe in things like theatre, music, writing, art...  In my opinion, every community should integrate some sort of system that supports ""amateur"" involvement, ongoing, in these things.  I am sure sports are similarly therapeutic.  However, <lj-cut>I see a lot more support going to sports, already, than these other areas, and for MY ""ideal"" community life, I want the arts...  (Well, maybe more sports support, too -- beyond Little League, or gender-biased supports...)

I think it would be oh-so-gratifying to colaboratively design a community setting that can create 'sanity' for its people. 

""Must have"" ingredients:

A conscience for social and environmental consequences.

A creatively diverse economy that might include bartering, more pooling-of-resources for community benefit like thrift stores, events planned to attract tourism, volunteerism...

Integrating 'schooling' for children that encourages relationship with community and life skills.  (Not everything can be measured or accomplished on paper, or through books, with academic testing...)

"event","Insights come to me --- not just current inclinations, but also their source.

<lj-cut>Once upon a time, I was 'property' of my oldest brother.  He was the only ""parent"" figure with the courage to actually SEE us kids and try to take action, invest, etc.  Unfortunately, he was also a teenager, which resulted in him mingling personal desires in with general compassion, understanding-of-circumstances, etc.  (He sexually abused me, and also supplied a huge amount of the parenting, guidance, investment, shepherding, etc. I needed as a kid and teenager.)

This brother had a superior IQ. And was very invested in projecting the values/standards of upper-middle income, professional people.  In clothing, health habits, education, protocol...

Well, I essentially ""liberated"" myself from being under his dominion, having him define 'reality' for me, and terms in which I could interpret or participate in the world, by 'racing' my evolutionary process my junior year of high school.

(The actual 'sexual' dimension of our relationship ended when I stopped ""playing"" hypnotized by him, Mr. Scientist, when I was 10.  However, when he returned from college, the service, etc. I was still in high school, and still in ""limbo"" ill-defined, living with single-parent Mom, so he 'rescued' in take-over fashion, characteristic of him...)

(I ""liberated"" myself by learning how to see and say insightful things, assert some boundaries, and self-nurture.  However, I did it at high-velocity, in a few months time, like that movie, ""Charlie,"" where the retard takes some experimental drugs, and turns into a genius.  That kinda happened to me, but I used intense diet, exercise, books, prayer, and ""divine"" help.)

'Racing' and obsessing on getting the 'upper edge' on high IQ or dominant people, has become a lifelong obsession.

I don't learn basic things, or express the patience needed to accomplish ""real"" relationships, because I am scared and 'stuck' in race-and-compete mode.  And I discount the 'simpler' realms of myself, hide them, neglect them...

When I think about, dream about, PLAN for winning a lottery, the whole thing angles around these basic goals:

1) Creating a community foundation that is liberated from economic dependance on mind-fucking corporate sovereign.  (Implementing concepts that are somewhat modeled in 'progressive' communities, or systems working to integrate social and environmental conscience into our culture.)

2)  Have a 'balance' accessible in that 'model' community for me to find both pleasure and purpose.

3)  Enable me to slow down enough to really THINK, and make ""fear-free"" or ""insecurity-free"" choices for my time.

And when I envision that ""insecurity-free"" existance, I realize I MIGHT not be MORE ""productive"" or invested, but just really-really gratified by what I DO with my time.

(Initially I envisioned so many jobs, experiences, investments, etc. that I barely had time to spend with my family.  Then I realized it might gratify me more to allocate mostly to others, or even just INVEST in others, to simply enable and support their readiness to DO these many things...)

And, when it comes right down to it, the things I really want to do with my time are pretty child-like, girly, or regarded as 'fluff' by many...

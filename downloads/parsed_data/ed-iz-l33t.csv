"event","I was using LJ's web-based updater and mis-clicked a link, and was sent to a blank page.  So I'm retyping this, but to me it always feels like the flare that comes from ranting is completely lost in the retype.  Obviously.  It's not a rant anymore.  But I'll pretend like it is, and you can pretend to care <3

Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends is one of my favorite cartoons of all time.  So I hit up IMDB:

My favorite character, Eduardo, is Slinkman from Camp Lazlo, who is also Spongebob Squarepants, who is ALSO The Mayor from Powerpuff Girls, and back in the day he used to be Heffer from Rocko's Modern Life.
Frankie is Yumi from Hi Hi.
Terrence (Mac's brother) is Raven from Teen Titans.
And don't even get me started on Wilt (Phil LaMarr).

Been awhile since I've been on LJ so just a quick update - Summer was OK.  Otakon was OK.  Did you know no one is 100% sure on the origin of the word ""OK""?  I like the theory that its roots are in the Choctaw word ""okeh"" meaning ""it is so.""  That's just because Native Americans are too cool, and I am a wishful thinker.

After several solid months of being ""OK,"" I was really looking forward to going back to schoool.  Silly Ed, silly.  Being a business major is tough.  Attempting to become a business major among peers who already are, is extremely annoying.  The air in my business classes is stuffy.  If air could feel pretentious, it'd be pretentious, but ""stuffy"" is the most suitable word that comes to mind.  As if I'm a walking opportunity to feel superior.

There are two distinct occassions where I've given off the impression that I wasn't sure what I was doing with my professional career.  Jokingly, expecting a chuckle and some assistance in reply, I explained my situation like a punchline.  On both occassions the immediate reply was a solemn, wide-eyed ""Are you serious?""

Wow.  Horrifying.  Is it OK that I was serious?  Am I eternally doomed to financial deficit?  Is it bad I had to check the spelling for deficit, and I plan on being a business major?  Ok, don't answer that one.  Clearly, college is a time for asking questions.

What am I doing?
Just what the fuck am I doing?
Will I be ok?

Yea, I'll be ok.  I've asked myself that question many times, and I spend no more than 10 seconds to think about it and conclude ""Yea, I'll be ok.""  The first question, I can't entirely answer though.  I AM here to earn a college degree, but I sure as hell can't say what I'll be doing with it.  At the very least, adding an attractive line to my resume.  But as Lily heard today in Anthro (my favorite class I've taken - Check out Prof. Trencher if you still need a Social Science credit), over 80% of college graduates spend most of their lives working a job that has nothing to do with their major.  I think it was 80?  Either way, that statistic makes me feel great.  I may not know exactly where I'll be in 5 years, but neither do a bunch of the students who ""are serious.""

Man, I've lost the momentum I had an hour ago.  I made some witty remark that had to do with us evolving as people instead of corporate weasels.  Or something.  Oh, I gotta include this next part as it validates me as not being a pure slacker:

Writer's block.  nevermind.

Maybe I'll go back and edit this.  Probably not.  This is where I said I was going to go because I had to do homework and Miami Ink was on... but now I have to go because I am really tired and this homework won't let me rest easy.  Man, I was really impressed with my last entry, and this one feels like a massive waste of time.  Like trying to trace a picture you drew, but spending more time tracing than you spent actually drawing the thing.  The trace looks shaky."

"event","so... i'm a little comment whore.  i'll admit it.  but really, why would you get an LJ account if you weren't?  to ""meet"" people?  if you really wanted to keep a diary/journal for your own thoughts, you could do it very easily without livejournal.  writing in a journal has so much more character, too!  you get lj cuz you want to share your issues with other people, and you want... maybe even <i>expect</i> them to reply.  well, this is one of those times for me...

i'm thinking about dropping out of mason, and pursuing cooking.  the original plan was ""go to mason, major in business, graduate and get a job.  later in life, use money from business and attend a cooking school.""  it's a pretty safe way of doing it, and if cooking is just a pipe dream, i'll still be safe financially.

so... why change the plan?

i have no idea!  maybe it's taking the easy way out... not having to study business, and going straight into something fun.  there's a quote that says ""it's not a coincidence that the hard way of doing things, is normally the right way.""  i have no idea where that's from, who said it or even if that's even it... but hey, if someone said something smart and is famous enough to be quoted, he musta done something right, eh?
that's not to say going straight into cooking school would be a cake walk.  i'd have to work many hours to support myself (because there's no way i'll push this onto my parents), and take a major risk in fucking it all up.

so i guess there's the end of my problem.

oh a lighter note, i went to dinner in a movie with my parents!  i haven't done this in a really long time, but i'm glad i did.  the sushi at sakura's isn't as good as i remember... but the sashimi was UNBELIEVABLE.  best sashimi i've had.  the sushi was shit.
anyway, we saw ""in good company"" at ffx corner.  GOOD movie.  luckily, not a date movie as i had feared.  i guess this movie only helped question my dillema.  i'd go into more detail, but i'm feelin lazy right now - i had actually intended to relate this entry to several parts of the movie, and was outlining it in my head on the car ride home.  like writing an essay i for school..

fuck, where was this going?  oh, i also decided that since it would be such a long post (had i done it essay-like), i'd post this as a nice little intermission in the middle:

<a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v378/dado/heart.jpg"">because brenda's never wrong</a>

regretfully, i didn't keep it.
i decided to get rid of the horn, sorry.  that was just for fun.  i liked it too, but do you know what it's like to look the mirror and not be able to take yourself seriously?  it sucks.  don't worry, if there's ever an event which requires me to have a horn, you can expect me front and center.  it was still nice to know that i could pull it off :D

i guess that's all.  chris got a new wireless card, and i want him to heal me <3"

"event","so i decided to shave my head.  no real reason, i guess...
but if i were forced to give one, it would be because my hair has been bleached 9 times and is screaming for a break.

so, as head-shaving goes, you always do a mohawk first, for the fun of it:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v378/dado/thirdhawk.jpg"">


seeing that i just may be able to pull it off, i go for a horn approach
looks like my head's on fire!  whee
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v378/dado/horn.jpg"">
i gotta say, i feel very ""no doubt""-esque


so i was bored, and wanted to do the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/digitalj/78943.html"">3d thing</a> that aj did before...
basically, you cross your eyes to force the two images into one
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v378/dado/3d.jpg"">
i find it's easier to think of it as 3 images, and as you cross your eyes,
trying to concentrate on the middle one

also, i'm aware it's a bit lop-sided. dont worry i fixed it :D

i'm thinking about keeping it.  atleast until tomorrow morning, cuz it's always fun to see parents shit bricks XD"

lame that i take surveys enough that two of my months start out with them.  and to think that if i do this next year, here's another month that starts out with a survey ;P
dammit, i shoulda posted pictures instead of doing this!
except aj has all the pictures..
and aj is w/o computer.
so... yea.  fuck!


and then i got bored enough, that i take the last sentence out of every last post of that month... this is what i got:

haha, that 1-sentence, 1-post in january killed me!  too much of my year revolved around deer, even when i tried doing it backwards... which makes me feel dependent and pathetic XD
i still like my last-posts better, though.  February is when i started another forty daze.  March is from when AJ fucked up!  if you'll notice my february first-post says ""anyone know?""  this is because i'm asking where aj is.  HE'S STILL MISSING AT MY LAST-POST IN MARCH!  hahaha that makes me laugh so hard.  april and may is my break-up w/ alisa i think... june/july are deer things as well. august is aj leaving to japan.  fuck i only have 11.  i must have skipped one.  ok here it is, THIS one is the true april:  ""i think the best way for me to beat my record would be to have a shotgun look out for cops :D""  i think this is my hour and a half drive to williamsburg.  but i've met a guy who beat it anyway, but that's cuz he's crazy.  so i got that postcard from aj in, september.  i left the fob part of november's post in there, since so many grilled me on it ;P
the rest is recent enough that it doesnt carry any nostalgia so i dont care to explain it ;P

if you're web-savvy, you can tell how really bored i was while doing this.  I CANT SLEEP!  aaah"

"event","so i'm walking on campus, with my newest and most-loved appendage - my ipod.

i recently got ""christmas with the rat pack"" (thx kat), and am still in the process of loading up my baby with xmas mp3s.

- oh, if you've got good ones, send 'em to me via aim! -

anyway, sammy davis jr's rendition of ""the christmas song"" came on... probably my most favorite rendition now, and i could NOT STOP SMILING.  a lot of you know how i look when i smile, but very few of you have actually seen me UNCONTROLLABLY smile.  if you're wondering if you have, then you haven't.

(think watermelon picnic, and select moments when no one's looking and i'm randomly turning my head; that's me avoiding eye contact!)

i went through all my pictures, but sadly i couldn't find an example.  it's a lot like my lj icon.

so if you can imagine it, you can understand how incredibly stupid i looked.  i thought to my self
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""what the fuck?!  am i 6 years old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;getting giddy of holiday cheer?!""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""yes.  yes, i am""
so i started to turn red, slightly embarassed by my child-like glee, but more so embarassed that at this age, with this hair, i just looked like a really crazy person.  trying to hold back, i bite my lip so deep into my mouth to the point where i am practically gnawing on it.

then sammy sings ""from kids from 1 to 92"" and i just let it go, and smile like an idiot.

I CAN'T WAIT FOR <sub><font size=1>almost</font></sub> EVERYONE TO COME HOME. <sub><font size=1>fuck you, japan</font></sub>

if you cant tell, i have another paper due :x
but luckily, this one is about me and ""how i live a good life.""  it can't be THAT hard, considering how often i attempt to justify why i live the way i do, here on livejournal (and what better place to do it, than the homepage for teenage angst?)"

"event","so i had a dream last night, and it involved me going up an eight-story ladder.  at the very, very top - where it met the ceiling (this was inside an eight-story building), i had the choice of jumping for a ledge (a good distance away... far enough that i'd have to risk grabbing onto the ledge if not making it in the jump), or just holding on for dear life.  looking down, i became dizzy and the floor begain to reflect, if not concentrate, all the sunlight pouring in.  i was at the top for so long that i began to get really sleepy...

if you've ever slept in my room, you know how extremely bright it gets at sunrise.  it was at this point in the dream that i began to wake up.  i ""woke up"" for a good 10 minutes.  it was at this point where it become one of those situations in which you're awake enough to feel things around you, but you're still in the mindset of your dream.

back in my dream, i kept thinking to myself ""i have to stay awake, i have to stay awake"".  this blew my mind.
you know how you do that little head-bob as you nod off, or try to concentrate on something while driving to keep awake?  in my dream, i could look down and see the sunlight (coming in from my real window), and an additional pole stretching out of the wall below me.  i realized later that it was my torch lamp, but in my dream, it was a black pole sticking out in contrast to the blinding floor.  <i>this</i> is what i chose to concentrate on to stay awake.

now please follow me here... i concentrated on something that i could see in real life, while i was dreaming... to continue an act in the dream.  my body was completely torn.  if i stopped concentrating on it for even a second, i would begin to fall asleep in my dream... which i knew would lead to my death.  of course i'm not aware this is all a dream, so i'm completely terrified of having to free-fall eight stories to my death.  i had to continue concentrating on it, or i would fall and the dream would be over.

anyway, this went on for a very long time (or maybe it just felt long because things tend to do that if you are in pain) until i woke up.  i'm not sure if i fell asleep in the dream, or if i tried waking up so hard that my body finally did... but either way, i woke up with a pounding headache.

well, that's my story.  the end.  sorry so anti-climatic ;P"

yes, yes... i'm putting off that paper that was briefly mentioned in my last post by taking surveys.

so, my thought on cigarettes this past week have been ""i should be able to smoke when i'm on break.""  it keeps me from over-doing it, and it helps deter me from forming a habit.  before this, i used to smoke a lot on campus because it was very relaxing... but to smoke to relieve stress will make me NEED a cigarette.  if i smoke just to enjoy it, then there ought to be no problem.
well that's what i was thinking last week.  and today my body feels like crap!  combine the facts that i drank last night and have been smoking after going a month (is it a month?  i'll round up either way), it's understandable that i feel this way.  then you add in that i didnt rest well, and HAVEN'T been resting well for the past two weeks, i sorta just feel like sleeping until winter break.  the sleep thing is to be blamed on aj getting internet!  my sleep schedule is very much in synch w/ japan now.

this break has been nice.

i wish it could go on for a few more days.  feels like it's being cut short, and things are left unresolved.  not that there's anything for my friends and i to ""resolve,"" but i'm just saying it has that feeling.  i guess it's ""i should have even more fun, dammit.""  feels like we spent most of our time shopping, instead of just hanging out and playing like we did in the summer.  oh well, there will be winter break soon enough.

this post is not ""written for fun"" by the way...

so dont expect any ""oh i want to live my life this way"" or ""i feel like this because of this"" kind of BS like i usually type.  this whole thing is to keep me from writing my paper.
haha how stupid!  to avoid writing a paper, i'm going to write something else (probably of equal length).

so yea, my last kiss was chris, while we were at a halloween party in richmond... if you can even call it a ""halloween"" party.  it was fun, though.  clearly, i was drunk.  the only guy i'd kiss sober is raf!  ha... ha... ... ... ...
so, we were sitting in a b.net chat, and raf says ""y'know... i've thought it out.  and in the last year, the only people i've kissed were all guys"" i immediately start laughing at him, ready to crack a joke... but i had to pause and think.  ""oh fuck.""
i really need to kiss a girl.  or atleast find one to hang with during winter break!  ""winter needs a girlfriend, always""
that's what va is saying to me right now.  we're talking about relationships as we tend to do.

va is a great person to talk to (when she chooses to respond to me, that is).  witty, intelligent, open and trusting...
edit: ""alluring in its own twisted way""
...we think the same thigns at times

i dont know where this is going.  this entry was going semi-smoothly until we started talking.  now i just tab back in every few minutes to tack on another sentence.

ah, the next survey question is ""last good cry.""  this works out because i talk to va a lot about alisa.
hm.  since i'm talking to va about it i dont feel like talking about it here.

<center>""i dont really remember, nor am i trying to remember...""</center>

i suddenly dont feel like typing this anymore.  blame va, she's taking up too much of my attention.

SHE JUST TOLD ME I'M LAGGING AND IS CHOOSING TO END THE CONVERSATION!  haha"

"event","gah!  i can't sleep again!
i had a bad day, so i feel very unsettled - that and i took a nap in the afternoon (maybe to get away from the bad day).  so yea, it's nearly 5 and i'm watching azumanga daioh.  haha god how i love it.  i started laughing really hard and was worried i'd wake my parents.

anywho, there are a lot of nicknames and it got me thinking about where mine originated from...

<b>ed</b>, which amazingly, was not used until late into highschool.  i never thought about how long that name took to rise, even though you'd think it'd be the first one, eh?  oh if you didn't know, my real name is eduardo.

well i guess my first would be ""<b>dondi</b>"".  it's pretty much my filipino nickname, but aside from that, i know nothing of its origins.  i like to think that it would have been my ""tribal"" name had the philippines not been touched by the rest of the world, but obviously this isn't the case.  i remember once, when aol was still a fledgling ISP, i used their ""profile search"" feature to see who else was named dondi.  MAN i felt so lame when i saw that EVERY SINGLE person named ""dondi"" was female.  hahaha, oh well oh well.  i've had it too long to really care.

""<b>dado</b>"" was given to me by an ex who thought it was cute.  do you sorta see it?  eduardo - e = duardo.  duardo - u = dardo.  dardo - r = dado.  i like it more than dondi, but it really only stuck with the falls church girls.  mainly because that's how bui introduced me to chris, who introduced me to virginia, who introduced me to the girls.  i was using it as an internet alias (for webdesign among other geeky things), and i met those people through a webdesign project.  geeky geeky.

when i went through a little ""i wanna be a graffiti artist"" phase, i was crushed when i discovered ""dondi"" was already famous in the world of graffiti.  i read up on him, and saw a lot of his pieces... really impressive.  he deserves the name more than i, so i had to come up with a new one for myself.  ""<b>reflux</b>"" is what i came up with after flipping through a latin book i got from school.  i was a freshmen, ok?!  well, <i>i</i> thought it was cool.  of course looking back, it's definitely not... but hey, i bet you used to be AzNxQTxdumbslut, so get off me ;P

oh god, screen names.  i don't even want to get started on how stupid most of us used to be.

shit, i had a lot of nicknames in my head when i started writing this but now i forgot.

i like <b>edu</b> cuz i'm a wannabejap.

<b>horsey</b> is dead, but that originated from the fact that to write ""baka"" in japanese you'd write the kanji for ""horse"" and ""deer"".  i was half of the idiot pair.

ooh, there's <b>eddo</b>.  only cute girls have called me eddo.  or maybe i think they're cute because they think they came up with eddo.  either way, don't you go and ruin the tradition by calling me eddo ;P

<b>dindo</b>!  only one person called me dindo, and i loved it every time she did.  same person also called me ""<b>milosh</b>,"" while i called her ""babushka"".

""<b>blue</b>"" is a pretty standard name for the drunk people at a party.  i respond to it, and am actually pretty flattered when people notice me (attention whore), so i enjoy that name too.

::pretty long pause, just sitting at keyboard::

HAHA ok now i'm remembering more.  in 5th grade there was this red-head who'd call me ""<b>retardo</b>""!  no one laughed, but i thought it was pretty clever!  victoria... something.  i'm sure my mom has got my elementary school yearbooks stashed away somewhere...

in my geometry class (in which i was teacher's pet), one of the pretty cool people i met called me ""<b>freduardo</b>"".  no idea why, but he did.  i'm not sure if this is before or after <i>the simpsons</i> used this in their tap dancing episode.

well, the purpose of this entry was to put me to sleep.  it's working!  working for you too, eh?  bastard.
well, before you go to sleep... or rather, after you wake up, browse your friends page like i know you do, and stop because i used bold a lot on this entry... feel free to post about the origins of your own nicknames.  things like this always interest me...

p.s. sorry this is poorly written.
actually, no i'm not.  did anyone expect this to be well-written?  well that's what you get.

ah my detective conan mp3 came on.  is anyone else pissed that they took it off the adult swim line-up?!  WHERE CAN I HONE MY EYE FOR DETAILS?!  damn anime-wannabe-geeks that shit bricks over dbz... controlling ratings and TAKING AWAY MY SHOW!

haha, i'll write until this song is over.
if you're wondering about the cause of my shitty day, i got in a fight with school today, and school won.
not to mention the papers didnt come in until four fucking thirty and i was on campus delivering until 6:30.  sure it's the same two hours of work, but this time i got stuck in rush hour.  people are such dicks during rush hour!

...i have way too many anime mp3s.  hajime no ippo just came on and i'll write until <i>this</i> song ends.  haha i love this song because it reminds me of the beach house this summer.

just the salazars and the heads, sans stupid aj.  it was so sunny some days... but maybe even more fun when it rained.  today's weather was shitty, contributing to the gloom and frustration.  at one point, there was a refreshing drizzle (i was sweating) and ""you"" by from the champloo ost came on and things looked amazing for four minutes and 58 seconds.  check out the song.  i'll send it to you on AIM if need be.

manual labor can be a bitch, but i enjoy the grunt work tokidoki.  a girl drinking coffee and studying outside jazzman's looked up to smile at me a few times... an elderly lady insisted on helping pick up a stack that fell off my dolly - and i tried to stop her, i'm not an inconsiderate bastard, but she got to it before me and just smiled... people can be so nice.

...

y'know, that thought (along with the sinatra that just came on), make yesterday... not so bad.
what's a quiz when i have a B in that class after bombing another quiz and skipping half the time?  all i have to do is do well on the final and i'll most likely leave with a B or better.  aaand i forgot a paper was due.  whoops.  i dunno how that one'll work out, but i'm definitely not gonna FAIL the class.  shit, i'm sure i'll do fine.

eric and i were discussing his ""lack of choice"" in signing up for his 20 credits next semester.  it came to a point where he called my argument weak (which it wasn't, by no means), and all he had to say was ""life isn't a fairy tale"".

life's not a fairytale.  that sorta stuck in my head... not because it came as a revelation, but because it was something i already knew held true for most people.  i was left wondering what makes people think that way...
what do <i>you</i> get out of a fairytale?  i'll tell you:
<center>you get a happy ending.</center>
if your happy ending is ""i get money,"" then no, your life is not a guaranteed fairytale.  if your happy ending is like mine, which is ""i'm happy"".  then... my life is a guaranteed fairytale.  confident and cocky, much like my last long-winded post...

wow.

i feel settled again.  did i just talk myself into that?  i'm sure that if i re-examine what i said in the morning, i'd like to retract a lot of things... but for now.... for now, it's serving a purpose.  oh yay, rufio just came on.  shit i better turn this off and go to sleep.  rufio always wakes me up...

goodnight all.  dont be surprised if some of this changes (or if it's not even here!) by the end of tomorrow.  hm.  i may as well edit the title now."

only 67.9% pure on the gay!  that means 12.1% of me is gay!  betcha cant beat that, raf!
i never viewed myself as being so shameful though...
i'm pretty average minus the straightness and the gayness.  i'm super-straight, and a little gay... which is more than others i guess.  maybe a little more sex drive than other people, too..

got the link from steve.  steve, if you read this, i was wondering if you still know about that website that assigns you a static ip, even though you're stuck w/ a dynamic one like me?
i didn't want to comment randomly outta nowhere on your lj, so i'll just leave it here perchance you read this :D

on a sidenote:
as you may know, i decided to quit smoking for the time being.
what do i have to show for it?
do i feel healthier?  do i have increased endurance?  no.
i gained 5 pounds!  hahaha.
oh well, i'm still not gonna start up for awhile.  just means i gotta work out more :/"

"event","i feel pretty content with life.  school is stable, family and friends are stable (now that you fuckers have left, i'm doing my best to manage without you), and <i>i</i> am stable.  i had a dream that alisa and i reconciled our differences and got back together again...
and when i woke up, i wasn't sad nor happy.  it was just another dream that i'd soon forget.  the one thing that i will remember though, is that when we were a couple again... i still didnt feel happy.  so i guess it's really setting in that she's not the one for me, and that i need to be more careful about what i commit to.

<center>friedrich nietzsche is so interesting.</center>

we're discussing him in philosophy and his ideals for life are just so amazing and inspiring.  no, not the anti-semitism (btw, if you think nietzsche is an anti-semite, you need to read him more carefully), but his views on managing impulses (ex. the weakness of religion) and the idea of our natural will to power just completely encourage me to keep living the life i'm living.

haha, anyway... i wonder if that will produce any hate comments.
i hope my life doesn't get too stable.  i'd like to hang out with a lot of people more often.  i don't know why i never get around to calling people.  maybe i'm afraid.  what i am for sure though, is sleepy.  i've managed to completely slack in all my classes, and manage to get away with it, as if i'd been studying just as much as anyone else.

wow, this was a very journal-esque post.  weird.  what in the hell put me in the mood for this?

oh, y'know what's nice?  constant music.  you'd think it'd get irritating, but it's as if my life's got a soundtrack [reference family guy]!  i was walking to bio lab today and this rip slyme song came on and it matched with the rhythms of EVERYONE walking.  a huge smile grew on my face and then i imagined myself hopping up on the benches and dancing around a bit (imagine ""singing in the rain"" by a not-nearly-as-slick anime dork), and at that point i actually laughed.  i must've looked insane to everyone around me.

wow i just feel like relaxing allllllll weekend.
who's got a nice view in mind for me?

speaking of relaxing with a nice view, which reminds me of smoking (because it just fits, okay?), i've decided i'm going to stop for awhile.  my insides feel tender, and hopefully quitting for a little will alleviate the situation.  it was about time i took a break, anyway.  once i realize that i really do have cravings for cigarettes, i stop cold turkey for awhile so that i don't develop an addiction.  ooh, very nietzsche, ed ;P

wow this thing is sooooooo long.  ahaha, this is the third, alternating-paragraph that starts with ""wow"".  i must be awfully impressed or awestruck by myself, eh?  cocky bastard.

let's start another paragraph here, just so i can start the next one!

wow i feel like i could write forever!  haha, and for once i dont care if people stop to read it or not.  oh right, back to relaxing.  so, i'll be needing <i>some</i> body of water (i'm thinkin lake.  ocean would be most preferred, but is also the least plausible) and a good friend or two to sit with.  maybe sing.  yea, let's sing.

haha, chris and i sang a LOT on the way back up from richmond.  there was some traffic (at 1am on a monday!) so i loaded up my soundtrack playlist and we got singin!  mostly disney.  i still can't tell if i'm tone deaf or not, but i can tell you that chris will usually try to hit the highnotes.  horrid.

i take it back, take the singing out of that relaxing equation.  fuck, i didn't start this one with ""wow"".  oh well, tradition broken.

and speaking of tradition, this halloween i puked out my passenger side door while a salazar drove my car!  woo!  i hope it doesn't happen next year, but digo says he'll induce vomiting with a strong punch to my gut.  i guess i'd rather get drunk.

20 minutes now.  i think i'll stop.  i <i>could</i> keep going but i feel the longer it gets, the more that people will get the impression that it contains something important that i'd like to discuss.  well I GOTCHA BITCHES!  guess i'll change the title."

"event","so i went to this wedding, and for the 3 hour break inbetween the wedding and reception, i hung out w/ my mom's friend's daughters.  they were really cool and let me tag along to pentagon city mall.  i was quiet at first (as usual.  i wish i wasn't like that, it's kinda akward), but became less shy as opportunities to be funny came ;P

of course i know why i'm here.  my mom wants to set me up.  she always wants to set me up -__-

well, i wasnt appealed to either of them in that way, but i still thought that they were really cool.  when the night was over, my mom bothered me about it and asked why i didnt get her phone number.  haha, that's my mom.  i had to explain that there wasn't anything WRONG with them, i just wasn't attracted to them in that way...

buuut... the more i look back on it, the cuter she (the younger sister) was.  they both had a good sense of style (omg the pleats owned me... and not the slutty kind but, she had a transparent-like white skirt that went past her knees w/ lotsa pleats and a white slip underneath), obviously loved her parents (she danced w/ her dad quite a few times.  really good dancer, kinda intimidating.. still completely adorable), and had a good sense of humor (well of course i'll think anyone who laughs at what i say has a good sense of humor ;P).

i'm not saying i wish i got her number or anything... i'm just saying how it's funny how people can be more attracted to a person, when looking back on things.

...well, i do wish i accepted that dance...

OH, and the actual reception itself was awesome.  sometimes filipinos can really put on a show.  makes me really wish i could song ^^;"

this is what my hair was like today.  i woke up two hours too early,
because my body likes to pull that kinda shit on me, and had
nothing better to do but put crap in my hair.  my left eye is now
going blind because a spike kept stabbing it.. haha.  it definitely
didnt turn out how i expected/wanted it to, but... yea... i was bored.
and i'm in a hair mood 'cuz i finally decided what i want my hair to
look like!!:

that's glue in the back, can't brush it out..) and i think i may
actually like it more

not only do i not give off the ""i've been swimming in grease"" look,
but it makes my hair look thick ^^; and i'm frowning in that

well, this is what i got in the mail a couple of days ago!&nbsp; as you can see, aj is still... aj.&nbsp; hopefully he'll have a permanent address which we could all write to him soon enough.&nbsp; actually, he may already have one, but i haven't talked to him lately.&nbsp; feel free to post any convo bits you guys may have on here.&nbsp; you can be sure i will.
edit:  i just noticed this cuz i fixed the address thing, but aj said ""united states america"" - HE'S ALREADY A FOB!  doesn't know what prepositions are!  gahahahaha

anyway, these are pictures of our going-away thing for aj.&nbsp; i figured that since he's going to japan and beef will be extremely expensive there, we may as well take him to the best steak house in the area (ruth's chris).&nbsp; the reservation was under kenji aimoto (courtesy of raf, who was tempted to say batman isntead).&nbsp; we got semi-dressied up (well aj and i did.&nbsp; the other three bastards wore jackets).&nbsp; dinner was awesome and it was a good way to enjoy our last night together for awhile.

we met up w/ aj's sister and cousin for some shisha.&nbsp; i jokingly asked aj if he was gonna cry tomorrow and he said he was a little worried about it.&nbsp; he then asked us and we tried to force ourselves to cry right there.&nbsp; it didn't work out very well.&nbsp; we tried putting smoke in our eyes (if you're a smoker, you know that feeling), but even that didn't work.&nbsp; it just resulted in very red eyes.&nbsp; some physical abuse here and there, but still no tears.&nbsp; once we had our share, we headed back to my place

played dota and drank a little.&nbsp; may as well see aj off doing the stuff we've always done together ;P
we stayed up all night doing that, and headed over to ihop for aj's going-away breakfast.

quite a number of people were there.&nbsp; diana made aj a cut-out of aj.&nbsp; wish i got a picture of it :/
there were other gifts, and i'm really sorry but they have slipped my mind ^^;
i have a really bad memory, sorry.

anyway, we were off to the airport to spend our last hour with aj.&nbsp; took plenty of pictures there, but unfortinately didn't get to spend as much time as we wanted with him.&nbsp; when it came to our goodbyes, no one cried... but i think it's really because we have a lot of faith that we'll see each other again.&nbsp; there's nothing that'll break us apart.

"event","for those of you who don't know, my mother decided to inform me that we were leaving for vegas they day before our flight.  very little planning, so we don't really get to see all there is to see, but i atleast managed to see the bellagio fountains.

<lj-cut text=""i HAD to rant about it.  it's nothing too great"">
SONG ONE:
so after catching a taxi back from the friedmont (the strip w/ all the lights you see in movies), we arrive at the bellagio and the first song they play is some classical song i can't name off the top of my head.  i was amazed.  the water might've reached the height of the bellagio itself, if not higher.
we start walking our way back to the venetian, but by the time we reach the bottom of the fountain, another 15 minutes had passed so we got to see another display.

SONG TWO:
i end up standing next to this cute, freckled japanese girl and her friend.  i've gone over with aj that i can't tell people japanese for sure, just by looking at them.  the first give-away was when she was leaning over the balcony to take a picture of the bellagio sign, slipped and lost her footing, and said ""ITE!"" (dunno if that's romanized anywhere near right.  it's the sound they make for ""ouch"")  anyway, OMFGSOCUTEIAMSUCHASUCKERFORNIPS!!!  the song starts playing, and it's chicago's ""all that jazz.""  this one was so much more impressive than the last one, it mindfucked me.  i have NEVER SEEN WATER LOOK SEXIER!  hahaha.  god i hope you know what song this is, so i don't seem like a... uh... water-nymph?
anywho, it was really amusing when the last ""jazz"" was being sung and the fountains shot as high as they could, because the cute girl's friend shouted ""BANZAI"" at the top of her lungs.  I WANTED TO JOIN IN SO BAD!  when the water settled, they started walking away saying, ""sugoiii!  sugoi sugoi..""

SONG THREE:
i decide i am not leaving until they stop playing songs.  the third one caught me off guard, but once it started playing i freaked out and started recording the fountains.  why?  because it's FRANK SINATRA - FLY ME TO THE MOON!  surely my hedz would enjoy this.  kinda sucks that i didn't get the start of it (which was so friggen cool).  but maybe i'll upload the video when i get home.  oh, and at the end some guy, early 20's, asked the old couple next to me ""do you know who sings that last song?""  i laughed, cuz i could imagine the twins freaking out.

SONG FOUR:
singin' in the rain.  of course.  how could they NOT do this song?!  the wind started picking up right about now, and mists of water would occassionaly hit the spectators.

SONG FIVE:
elton john - my song.  made me feel really sad at first... but i tried to block it all out and just enjoy the fountain.  towards the middle, i caught myself half-mouthing and half-singing.  haha, i'll never forget these stupid words.  oh well, it made me feel happy, singing...

SONG SIX:
conte par tiro.  i dont know the performer, but isnt it impressive enough that i knew the title?  you'd recognize it too, if you heard it.  at this point, the most BEAUTIFUL italian girls stand next to me.  of course, they're like half a foot taller than me, so i musta been pretty hard to notice.  short skirts, high stilettos, and a light perfume that was hard to notice... i almost died.  when the song ended, the bellagio started playing the stand-around music and it was dido's ""white flag.""  everytime the girls stopped talking (in their unbe-fucking-lievably sexy language), one would immediately start singing, as if she was still continuing her last sentence.  WHAT A VOICE.  i'm a little girl-crazy right now, if you couldn't tell.  yea, yea... i've got issues.

SONG SEVEN:
our national anthem.  of course this one was done really well, and also had the most high-shooting fountains.  some impressive americana.

um.  thanks for sitting through all of that if you did.  actually... if you sat through all of that shit, you must've been bored as hell with nothing to do.  YOU OWE ME!</lj-cut>

oh, and casino's DO care.  even if you're JUST playig slots :/

edit:
i forgot to mention... to the hedz (maybe even aj, if he can come back)... once we hit 21, we're going to vegas.  i say we just save three to four hundred bucks each, get a room at the bellagio, and blow all our money on liqour and gambling.  i even found a spot at the fountain where we can jump over the balcony and sit on a ledge.  i doubt security will see us, too!
I'M BEING SERIOUS!  4 or 5 of us splitting the price (and maybe getting a hook-up from mrs. yim?) would make this totally possible.  everything is beautiful and the hotels are insanely nice.  the pool here (a the venetian) is a ""garden"" pool!  tropical plants all around it, half of it indoors, the other half out.  the ceilings are all painted and the indoor mall is structured like a town in venice.  each store is its own building, and the ceiling is painted like the sky!  it's done so well that it looks like it's moving.  EVERYTHING IS SO NICE!  THIS PLACE WOULD BE SO PERFECT FOR US!  IMAGINE BEING ALL DECKED OUT, DANNY OCEAN STYLE!  i get excited just thinking about it.
wow, i just added a whole lotta crap outside the cut ;P"

"event","awake.  early.  i feel groggy, but i'm really happy, so i decided not to go back to sleep.

i'm such a sap for romantic comedies.  i guess movies in general, but especially for romantic comedies.  i'm a total ass to lots of people, and most people will never see it, but i'm a little bitch in the movie theatre.  i tear up, i get excited, i feel everything the writers and directors want me to feel.  for two hours and 8 bucks, i am their bitch, and i wouldn't have it any other way.

i saw <i>the terminal</i> last night.  teared up a good 10 times.  teared!  not cried!  let's get that straight right off the bat.  a decent amount of dignity is left, right?  no?  oh well.  i don't really tear up at the sad scenes, though.  it's always the happy ones that get to me... where you see such a rare degree of human kindness and compassion that it brings just a little more faith back into mankind.  there was plenty of that in <i>the terminal</i>; it was a good flick.  but even for movies like the new spiderman that's out... even that train scene (for those of you that've seen it) got the eyes a little watery.  who tears up during spiderman?  haha.

but the romances... always put me through a little hell afterwards.  reminds me that movie endings are rarely the result, or they hit a little too close to home (like in terminal).  i was going thru a little withdrawal last night... but i'm better now.

i'm great now.  thank you for the wake-up call.  even though i'm sure you were busy, just thought i'd let you know that not a day went by where you didn't cross my mind atleast once."

"event","so after a muggy and unproductive day, i leave my house with my just-as-muggy-and-unproductive friends.  my mood wasn't too great this morning, and i was annoyed by the rich snobby lexus that cut me off.  coming to a light, there was a skinny white boy with a gelled-up do and oakleys on, that i passed on my left, and another semi-buff but more of a beergut guy i passed on my right.  scoffing at the self-centered-looking frat-boy bitches, i pulled up to a family on my left.  a father, a son, and a little girl.
being in the shitty mood i was, i made eye contact with the little girl and i then looked ahead to ignore her.  curiousity forced me to turn back and there she was, staring at me with little blue eyes.  i look forward again, trying to ignore her... but i picture her in my head and she was really one of the cutest little girls i've ever seen.  ""i'm acting 'hardcore' so a little girl will be scared of me?"" i thought to myself.  i start to smirk and look back at her.  this time, she's got her knees on the seat and looking at the car behind theirs.
as the light turns green, she sits back down and turns to me and gives a slow wave to me.  i wave back and we both smile.
from then on, i haven't really been able to stop smiling.  thank god for that little girl.  i half-believe he sent a little cherub down to pick up my mood.  amazing what a clear head and an adorable child can make you feel."

i had another one this morning, and i'd be a liar if i didn't say it was about her... it made me sad when i woke up, but not too soon after that i thought about how i don't care.  atleast i need to stop caring... i know that will never happen, but it's nice when some lies play themselves out.

i felt better, until i realized that she didn't dream of me.  i know this because she's not thinking about me.  what a horribly painful feeling.</lj-cut>"

"event","so i had this long-winded post running through my head all last night... just itching for the moment i could log onto someone's computer and vent...

a whole ""why is this happening?"" schpiel and ""what happened to my perfect life?"" kinda shit... cuz i really did have one.  i loved my family and friends and my beautiful girlfriend.  although those are all leaving and i was super-depressed about it all, i feel a lot better now.

i thought my views on life were changed.  life, love, God... everything.  life no longer seemed fair and i actually contemplated suicide.  SO YOU MOTHERFUCKERES BETTER TAKE CARE OF ME BEFORE I GO EMO ON YOU ALL.

...just kidding.  i'm better now.  i'll enjoy things now.  all it took was some counting crows, rocket summer, and sapna.  the whole ""if it was meant to be"" shit doesnt make sense, nor does much else...

chris is sitting next to me, reading over my shoulder.  i'll stab him if he doesnt watch out.

i'm just pouring shit out.  i'm in a good mood.

now aj is.  i'll stab him, too.  fuckers.

anyway, yea... life is good and it will all work out for me.  nothing is my fault, and if it is, i was meant to deal with it.  blahbittyblahblah.

things make sense now.  live in the moment, and enjoy it.  that's the way i think about things.  i don't know where we'll be in the future or if we'll still love each other, but i know that right now i love her with all that i can, and that's all i need."

tell me if that makes sense to you.  i still live in my little romanticized world where ""love is all you need"" is a fact and not a shitty song lyric.  a world where the girl thinks ""love is not enough"" but comes to realize it's all you need to be happy, by the end of the movie.  movies lie, and the way i think doesnt make sense anymore.

"event","<lj-cut>i'm glad to be here, at the twins' house.  one of the few places where my memories aren't overtaken by her.  i finally moved back to my house, and before i could even unpack, it all happened...
now i have to put away the ""someone at w&m loves me"" bear, along with jun'ai my pet lion... the box full of notes, letters and a rose from prom.  a damn scrap book that i could probably never look inside again... and every article of clothing that reminds me of her.  there isn't a damn thing that doesn't remind me of her.  the end of it wasn't bad or anything... but i'd rather not remember right now.  i guess i'm just a coward who'd rather cope by running away than dealing with missing her.
i came here, with a million words in my head that i wanted to write while i was driving, but not one comes to mind now.  all i remember is the flood of memories that smacked me in the shower and the fact that my eyes feel like they're swelling.  not the regular watery-near-crying  kind of swelling with tears, but one where the tears build up behind my eyes.  the ones that are there because i want to cry, but just can't.
anyway, i've gotten enough of this off my chest to last me for a little while.  atleast enough to keep me from breaking down and calling her.</lj-cut>"

"event","so, i'm a new waiter at the damon's over in chantilly.  i love this job.  and i know this is gonna piss a lot of you servers off (looking at kat and ann), but this is such an easy job.  i know you're gonna say ""well expect it to get much worse.""  well i've already had really, REALLY bad days (i.e. customers walking out, i spilled dinner on a guest, broken a martini glass, had a table who requested a ""girl... make sure she's loose"")  but i'm making plenty of friends, and it's a really fun job, well worth whatever pay i get.  frankly, i'm surprised i'm getting as much as i am.  today, i made next to nothing ($30 for 7 hours of work), but i'm sure it'll even out, so i have no reason to complain.
so today, a couple of japanese fobs came in, and i actually got to use the phrases ""arigato,"" ""itadakimas"" and ""yorokonde"" with purpose.  amusingly, a table of white trash got seated right next to them in my section (they're only starting me out with two tables, since this is my first time serving).  funny cuz it's what i love on one side and what i hate on the other.  man i hate white trash so much.  they obviously looked down their noses at me, but they still left a decent tip and left in a timely fashion.  i had  a lot of campers today, so not much money was made (was also sectioned in the bar).
but still, this job has made me a much friendlier person (to strangers at least... i still hate a lot of people i know :P).  i'm also meeting really cool people (this is redundant, eh?).  um... i think that's all i have to say.  i love my new job :D
i cant wait to move out."

"event","oh man, what a great friggin night!  well after i saw guys and dolls w/ my alisa, we went to t.g.i.friday's for some grub, but got kickede out cuz of a [possible] bomb threat (we think).  after getting some free drinks, we hit up a denny's to grab some food and spend some quality time at emily's.  it was cool seeing some familiar tilly faces and finding out i have stuff i common with robert neisen.
after taking katie and alisa home, i get picked up from mason and the heads and i head over to rehan's.  hijinx and video games as usual... until the cake comes out.  we sing happy birthday, blow out the candles and all that usual crap.  then we throw some cake into digo and raf's faces for a picture... which started a huge food fight.  everyone got cake in their hair and after cleaning up and throwing our clothes off, another round starts and there's a lot of cake on half-naked bodies.
hopefully i'll get pictures from rehan soon :D"

so... the drive down was the worst one to date.  an hour and a half stuck in traffic on 95 before things <i>slightly</i> picked up.  but atleast i got to look at the little rainbow segment along the way.  but it was all worth it when i made it down to williamsburg!  we went out to dinner at some sports bar with the BEST DAMN PIZZA I'VE HAD MY ENTIRE LIFE!  I'M NOT KIDDING!  IF GOD ATE PIZZA, THIS WOULD BE IT!  anyway, we went and saw will farrel in <i>elf</i>.  it was hilarious and cute.  i tear up at cute things.  haha... what a fruit!
anyway... it was a great night.  the next day, i slept in, but was forced to wake up to go to target.  dah!  haha... but later that day we went to the alpha chi formal which was fun.  dancing is different when i'm w/ alisa.  went back to her amazingly nice dorm (damn wm dorms) and watched <i>pirates of the carribean</i> for the first time.
sunday, we went to lunch over at the cheesehouse... i think?  but yea, good food.  williamsburg is so friggen nice compared to... everywhere.

so the past week has been full of libbing and working on costumes (ota nostalgia, anyone?) all for thursday and friday.  the hedz and i went as yakuza... that's the japanese mafia for all you wide-eyes.  inspired by my new favorite movie (as you can see from the layout), kill bill.

so after gettin' all prettied up, we head over to rachel's to pregame a little (""a little"" too much, for me... especially considering i didn't eat to reap the full benefits of the buffet at the party).  so yea... i puke and pass out on the way there.  i hear jian got us lost.  but yea, we arrive at the party, and they took our weapons away.  not too big of a shock, but upsetting nonetheless.  the party was friggen awesome.  nothing makes you more comfortable than being with your friends... in a mask... under the influence.  we make aj shake his groove thing, sometimes me forcing his hands to move, other times roxbury style... and probably the most comfortable for him, guided by the ever-so-cute mari.  not much happened besides dancing, but that was the most fun i've had dancing (this means a lot coming from a guy).  we decided to call it a night after the party... mainly cuz i was feeling sick (i puked twice more after the party ^^).

friday was the day of halloween!  trick-or-treating was sort of a bust... kids stop a lot earlier than we used to.  we did manage to scare some people though... and also rescued a little girl's cell phone!  haha.  i think we may have scared her, too.  afterwards, we meet up with more people at ihop, and had some diana fun.  went to giant, got some reeses pieces and also freightened a few more people in wendy's.  then back to my dorm... we chill in the lounge and engage in all-out reeses pieces combat.  everyone crashes at my place again, and i go to sleep extremely satisfied.  oh, i forgot to mention we raped aj.  i mean... araya.  aj was his virgin name.

saturday, i left to go see alisa in her intonations concert!  sorry i missed out on your going-away lunch, koji :(  but the a capella group was great (they had beatboxers!  haha).  afterwards, i went to wawa for my first time, and then we saw a sister hazel concert outside.  good band, just not my sound.  william and mary is so much nicer than gmu, but i dont think i'd like it there.  mason's my home :D
sunday, we ate lunch at the caf (their buffet pwns ours), and walked around colonial williamsburg.  it was a great visit... so great, that i fell asleep many times on the drive home.  i dunno what we did that made me so tired >_<

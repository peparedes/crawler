I decided to wait until I moved to make the appointment.  Today I recieved a postcard addressed to me and it cracked me the hell up!  This is what it says...

""Dear Mary,
     Just in case Kragen forgot/misplaced/ate or has hidden the reminder we sent, our records show he is due for the following treatments or examinations.  Please give us a call for an appointment.  Remind Kragen that all kitties who visit recieve a present of special catnip!!!"""

"event","Today I subbed for the high school behavioral program and had a REALLY good day.  Sometimes the students can be triggered by the smallest of changes and having a sub isn't that small of a change.  Overall it was great and even the paraeducators were surprised on how well the kids behaved all day.  

I always tend to look at the walls and see what is up because some teachers have the coolest things posted in their classrooms.  The following is something this particular teacher has posted on the outside of her office door.  It's called The Invitation by Oriah I'll put it under a cut to save space.  It really spoke to me today so I had to share it with all my friends here.

<lj-cut text=""The Invitation"">

It doesn't interest me what you do for a living.
I want to know what you ache for and
If you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing.

It doesn't interest me how old you are.
I want to know if you will risk looking lik a fool 
for love
for your dream
for the adventure of being alive.

It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon...
I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow
If you have been opened by life's betrayals
or have become shrivelled and closed from fear of further pain.

I want to know if you can sit with pain
mine or your own without moving to hide it
or fade it 
or fix it.

I want to know if you caan be with joy
mine or your own
If you can dance with wildness
and let exstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes
without cautioning to be careful, be realistic
remember the limitations of being human.

It doesn't interest me if the story you are telling me is true.
I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself.
If you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul.
If you can be faithless and therefore trustworthy.

I want to know if you can see beauty even when it is not pretty every day.
And if you can source your own life from it's presence.

I want to know if you can live with failure 
yours and mine
and still stand at the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon,
""YES.""

It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money you have.
I want to know if you can get up after the night of grief and despair
weary and bruised to the bone and do what needs to be done
to feed the children.

It doesn't interest me who you know or how you came to be here.
I want t oknow if you will stand in the center of the fire with me
and not shrink back.

It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied.
I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else falls away.

I want to know if you can be alone with yourself
and if you truily like the company you keep in the empty moments.

"event","I read this in a book that I have just finished and it applied to me so much.  

The Al Chayt
Because the relief of pain is built into its perception,
I search within and remember when:
I did not use my power; I did not see; I resisted change; I wouldn't risk; I was afraid of excitement;
By these namings, I ask for the help that I long for, the curative help, the insight.

We violate that which is Eternal when we violate ourselves; for our failures of truth, we ask for honesty and courage:
For acting out of fear of looking at ourselves deeply and honestly;
And for using honest self-examination as a substitute for changing ourselves. 
For paralyzing ourselves by thinking we could not chang;
And for using these prayers as a substitute for real change.
For perpetuating vindictiveness by not forgiving our parents for the hurst they have inflicted on us as children;
And for sustaining guilt and anziety by not forgiving ourselves for the negative traits we inherited.
For giving ourselves to the fleeting pleasure of inflicting lasting hurts;
And for cynicisim which eats away our faith in the possibility of love.
In naming these errors, I confront them, I accept them, and I commit myself to avoiding them in the year ahead.

We evade that which is Eternal when we evade ourselves; for our failures of truth, we ask clear vision:
For those times I turned a deaf ear on the cries of children;
And for those times I turned a deaf ear to the small child within me.
For those times when I believed that I was alone, and that there was no point in reaching out to others;
And for those times when I believed that my temporary helplessness was permanent,
In recalling this pain, I experience it, I heal it, and I commit myself to replacing it with joy in the coming year.

We deny that which is Eternal when we deny our own depths.
For the misdeeds we have committed with our bodies and souls, we here today seek to speak them out, expose them to the air, to our tears, to our laughter.
For not being present in the moment, and instead, being off somewhere else, worrying;
For not allowing ourselves to play;
For focusing only on our shortcomings, and not on our strengths and beauties;
For the blessings I lost by not trusting myself;
And for the blessings I lost by not trusthing others;
For withholding love and support;
And for being judgmental of others and myself.
For thinking I would run out of love it I gave too much of it away;
And for doubting my ability to love and recieve love from others.

And again, I remember:
My non-involvement;
Failing to love;
Failing to see the humor.

In naming these lost blessings, I let go of regret and bitterness, I recognize the inexhaustibility of life's blessings, and I vow to be open to these blessings as they come to me in this comming year."

When you tell people that you're Republican, they rarely believe you.

That's because you're socially liberal - likely pro-choice and pro-gay rights.

You're also not so afraid of big goverment, as long as it benefits people and not politicians.

You are the most likely of any Republican type to swing over to the Democrat side sometimes.

Kody sat down on the avenue
He tapped his feet, to the humming of the highway
He watched the light shine down on the broken glass and thought
I don't got no reasons, yet
There it is and there it was
It was clear to all of us
We kept this hat of broken dreams
And we pulled them out, when we needed them around

[chorus]

So please hand me the bottle, I think I'm lonely now
And please give me direction, I think the hurt set in
And I don't feel nothing

There's a squeak hinge down on the back gate
It lets us know if he comes around
I don't sleep that good anyway
If you've never heard the silence, it's a God awful sound

[chorus]

I don't feel nothing, no I don't feel nothing
There's nothing to feel good about here

Don't much get down to the avenue
I could drive, but it takes so much to get there
Don't get off on all the broken glass, the cadillac scene,
Well
I've seen a lot of good things die and I'm
In an over emotional way

[chorus]"

I must say that while summer classes are kicking my ass I am having such a great time.  First off I have an amazing statistic professor.  I mean she just utterly rocks!  Today she was talking about saying one thing and writing another and if we catch her doing it to stop her and she was like, ""Yeah I'm sure I have a bizarre case of statistical tourettes!""  She like is the most down to earth, intelligent woman around this campus on statistical stuff!  

The excitement for this weekend was that I got stung by a bee!  Yes Mary the person allergic to everything is ALSO allergic to BEES!  Lucky for me it was on my arm so I didn't have to go to the hospital and I had gotten benedryl into my system within 7 minutes of getting stung and FINALLY today (3 days AFTER the fact) my arm is getting back to normal size!  I went to the dr's and got some meds for it that won't knock me on my ass like benedryl does and I got a perscriptionprescriptionHATE bees and here in E-burg we have TONS of them.

Next week should be interesting as I'm going to be having my two lil' cousins over for the ENTIRE week!  Yes I'll be responsible for a 13 year old and an 11 year old.  I have classes in the morning but we are planning fun things for the evening.  Like riding our bikes to get ice cream and a day in Seattle at the zoo!  I really do enjoy my lil' cousins so it should be a grand old time!

By the way messages for individuals...Tia when do you leave for Ireland??? Lauren...just wishing you a digity dank day!"

"event","""If you don't want what I want, please try not to tell me that my want is wrong.
Or if my beliefs are different from your's, at least pause before you set out to correct them.
Or if my emotion seems less or more intense  than your's, given the same circumstances, try not to ask me to feel other than I do.
Or if I act, or fail to act, in the manner of your design for action, please let me be.
I do not for the moment at least as you to understand me.  That will come only when you are willing to give up trying to change me into a copy of you.
If you allow me any of my own wants, or emotions, or beliefs, or actions then you open yourself up to the possibility that some day theseways of mine might not seem so wrong, and might finally appear as right - for me.
To put up with me is the first step to understanding me.
Not that you embrace my wayz as right for you, but that you are no longer irritated or disappointed with me for seeming waywardness.
And one day, perhaps in trying to understand me, you might come to prize my differences and far from seeking to change me, might perserve and even cherish those differences.  
I may be your spouse, your parent, your offspring, your friend, your colleague.  But whatever our relation, this I know:
You and I are fundamentally different and both of us have to march to our own drummer."" ~Unknown~

The above quote states how I feel.  I'm so tired of people judging me and trying to change me.  I just want to be left the way I am.  I just want to be me and I'm sorry if that is not what you want from me, but last time I checked it wasn't your choice.  I want to be encouraged for the good I do and not torn down because I'm not the mirror image of someone else!  I just want to be accepted and NOT judged..guess that's a lot to ask though..."

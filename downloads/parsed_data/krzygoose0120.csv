"event","horrible horrible day.

first started off with me sleeping in, only have 10 minutes to get ready before i miss the bus. i go to my contacts casse and find out that all there is left in it is one contact and half a peice of the other one. so now i have to wear my glasses all day(which by the way are not perfectly focused for me anymore). then its the last minute and i cant find my shoes. so i have to wear my old dirty ones from deep in my closet. i run to the bus stop and just barely make it. i get to matrix and im reminded that i have to go outside in the freezing cold for two hours picking up trash around the property. in the middle of 2nd hour, i start getting cramps and i beg romito to let me inside. i do my business and go outside to find the class. no one is there. as im looking, an old man asks me if im looking for someone. i tell him my class is out here and he says he doesnt see any classes and almost accuses me of skipping. i go back inside and look down the matrix hallway. no one there. then to the kiva. no one there. back outside and walk all around the school. no sign of anyone. i give up and sneek back inside. went back to the kiva and there they were. all that walking for nothing. then rachel is crying (personal reasons) and my cramps are as worse as hell. atkinson lets me and rachel talk about it in the kiva and we go up to the commons to get a snack from hudson. hudson obviously was pmsing and yells at us. i tell her about rachel and aparently she doesnt give a shit and bitches some more about staying with the group.

i miss chad. i havent spent anytime with him after school in the past week. and i cant spend time with him today because he has to work.

so please...someone just call me and hang out with me tonight so i feel better."

cindy is the best dog i ever had. ive had her ever since i was 6. i remember playing with her outside after school, and swimming in the lake. shes one of the very few beagles that <b>love</b> to swim. shes an outside dog so she spends most of her time running and hunting rabbits with my dad over the fall. we cant let her out of her lot right now because she might eat the baby rabbits. when i get my lisence, my car is fixed and i have the money, i hope to take her to petco and get her groomed. she may get as stinky as she is now two days leter but it will be worth it because i love her and she deserves it. she is a wonderful dog. we named her cindy.
heres some more pictures of her.

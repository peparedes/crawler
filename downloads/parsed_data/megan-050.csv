i'd tell you to stay far away

games i dont choose

i dont mean to hurt you 
it's not my intetenion 
it happens 
i wish it wouldn't

i know i can't 
i know that i'm strong 
because i make you weak 
i push you away 
try to make you mad

"event","i thought i found him once
the one i was destinced for
he came into my life and
it hit me like a ton of bricks
it was pefect, the nights
i thought they could last forever
he was made for me
i knew it without a doubt
and then there she was
with her dirty blonde hair
that flowed like a matted mess
she was beautiful, i hated her
he left me, not once
but many times for her
she gave him something i couldn't
and she took away my most prized
possession.
he came back, and i let him back in
again, i was hurt, and torn
and even again i took him back,
he was my breath, my every energy
still now i can't cry, the pain is still there
but i have a funny way of staying numb
i miss him, sometimes it's excrusiating
i know however he wasn't the one
i feel i shall never have love again
i can't give what others give,
i feel as if i have nothing left to offer
only my torn heart survives
i want love, i really do
but somehow i don't believe in it any longer"

"event","i hate that song that makes me think of you
you know the one?
the one from the first night
the night you said you loved how my hair smelled
but you hated my pink toe-nail polish
you told me you knew you had loved me forever
just couldn't admit it until that night
and we both laughed, because it was incredibly cheesy
do you remember the one?

i hate that song that reminded me of the river
you know the time we went and skipped rocks
and sat on the railroad tracks with our feet dangling
remember? 
you laughed becuase i was scared
and then you kissed me

i hate that the song brings your taste back to my lips
your body was warm and great to cuddle up to
you were my cuddly teddy bear and you held me just right
remember?
on the way home you squeezed my hand
i was ready to tell you i loved you
but you beat me to it
i ran to my room and jumped on my bed, i was ecstatic

remember that song?
the one we danced to under the moonlight
where you spinned me around
and i sang in your ear
you said i had an amazing voice and i blushed

remember driving to the movies?
that song played faint in the background
the wind was in my hair as we drove in your red car
you looked at me and i looked at you
you winked and i laughed becuase i thought there was something
in your beautiful green eye
remember?

remember that one song?
you played it for me the night i came back
you told me that you knew i was the one
we sat in the sonic parking lot for two hours
talking and planning our future
the smell of tatertots smothering us
i turned away for you not to see my tears

remember that last song?
the one from the country road
that day you told me it was over
that the love was gone and she was what you wanted?
remember how you cried and i begged you no?
i was tough for 15 mins, and that damned song
it struck something inside and i cried
i cried for 2 days

i hate songs that make me think of you
because of all the bad and good times."

low and down
but for some reason i'm numb
maybe it was the pills, i don't know
i just feel as if i'll cry
it could just be the cigarette smoke
i don't know for sure
i feel alone
like a lost child in walmart
i need someone to take my hard
show me where to go
what to do
my life is in a ditch and i have no rope
i can't climb out of this feeling
i wish i knew what to do
where my life should go
it seems as if everyone else knows what to do
where to go
everyone except me that is
i wish i had a compass
one that worked and was easy to read
to direct me in the right direction
but no
there is no compass to help me right now
they are all broken
today school started
i never thought i could miss it
but i do
i miss the drama and hot football players
who always ignored me
i need a job
something to occupy my wandering mind
but i haven't found one
i do believe i could smile again if i could 
just stop thinking.
damnit.
the smoke is in my eye again."

I don't like him as much as I like Zach, but then again, I haven't hung out with him as many times. I honestly don't care about the brady thing anymore, the only thing i miss is his mom, that killed me to see her the other day, i just miss her like crazy :(. she's so awesome and i wish i could see her more, we decided that one day after graduation me and her are gonna take off shopping. ahh i can't wait.

In a way i'm scared because i'm scared he could still have feelings for heather and that's what's happened with the last 2 relationships i've had. i really just don't want to get burned again. who knows maybe i'm just being lame about this all, but i guess i'm just worried to get hurt. but what happens will happen."

my heart aches for Zach, I feel horrible for him, he called me tonight,
and i knew something was up, he sounded like he had been sleeping but
then he told me that his uncle passed away today and evidently he was
close to him. It made me completely sad to hear how bummed out he was,
i wished i could just hug him right now. he's so perfect in every way,
i think that honestly he'd be the only guy i'd want to be with right
now, just because i feel like i could honestly trust him with all my
heart. is that crazy to feel so strong about one person so soon? like
my friend kasey from wichita wanted to hang out saturday, and i made up
this absolutely lame excuse not to hang out with him, because i want to
hang with zach, even if there is a possibility that he can't hang out,
i'd still like to only hang with him right now. i feel like i already
have a boyfriend, but i dont mind at all. my parents were going to go
out of town this weekend to texas and i thought it was gonna be awesome
i thoughtm aybe zach could just come hang out here with me. but then
tonight they decided that they woudln't go out of town, so maybe i can
go to benton (if he's still up to it) tomorrow night. saturday night we
also were planning to go on a double date (me + zach &lt;3 and brynn +
brett.) but i also don't know about that, i guess saturday is the
viewing for him, that could be a really tough day. it's ok though, if
we're not goin to hang out then i completely understand. i hope all is
ok.<br>

I feel like i'm obsessed. i can't quit thinking about Zach, it feels
like we've been together for a really long time, because i'm so
comfortable with him, i feel like i honestly could tell him anything. i
want to be with him a lot, just to see him, i think he's so sexy.
Tonight at work this guy had on this cologne and he smelled just like
Zach, it made me want to call him so bad. I wanted to just take my
truck and drive to Benton to see his cute ass. I guess Friday night I'm
goin to his house and we're gonna watch movies, I getta meet his
parents... :). I really hope they like me. In 2 weeks i'm goin to a
titty bar with Zach, omg it will be fn hilarious. He's so cool, brady
wouldn't of ever takin me before and I just think it will be a shit
load of fun. so zach told me tonight that he talked about me so much to
jason today that jason told him to shut up 7 times because he didn't
wanna talk about me anymore, isn't that so cute! i'm not the only one
thinking about the other person a lot &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3. Gosh this is
the best feeling in the world, he makes me really happy.<br>

We had a date last night, we went to see Amityville horror show and that was fun, we kept talking through the whole thing, he even held my hand as we were leaving, and he unlocked my door and opened it for me, it was very nice. Then we went to where my truck was and we sat there talking and talking, saying that we were gonna start hangin out a lot and that we wont kiss anyone else because i guess you could say we're 'talking'. it's so cute. it's great that he wants to be a fireman, i just think that's so cute. ahh i can't wait to see him again. i just want to be next to him, he has a nice body i love it, he's really good a cuddling and he doesn't move to fast? this is great, nothing beats liking someone...or having a crush.

he called me tonight. :) it makes me forgive him for not coming to see
me last night, it bummed me out. but he said he fell asleep so i
believe him, he's so cute! ahh. he keeps asking me to hang out too,
it's great, i think maybe he does like me now. which is kickass because
i deffinatly like him. i think about him a lot... is that weird? i dont
know why i feel this way so soon. maybe brady was right and he did
'sweep me off my feet' since i'm feeling like this. i wish he would of
been at brett's last night, so i'd of gotten to see him. i think
tomorrow he's comin to get me and we're gonna go see the Amittyville
Horror Show. Ahh it will gimme a reason to hold onto him &lt;3 &lt;3
&lt;3.&nbsp; mmm he's so cuddly. ah ok i have to stop thinkin about

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 153);"">Tonight was so amazing, Zach
couldn't be more great. I can't stop thinking about him, I wish I could
rewind the night to when I first saw him tonight. he makes me laugh so
much and he's really innocent sort of. we didn't watch either of the
movies really, i decided that i wanted to drive my truck and so we
squeezed in there. we cuddled a lot and he told me he loved my smile,
that it's what he was first drawn to about me. i told him it was his
dimples that drew me to him. i really like this kid. honestly i cried
on my way there, for one it was sad that i left my brady chapter in the
dust, but on the other hand i was really excited and i knew that i
would have a good time, it was nice to not think about brady tonight.
zach had my complete attention, i dont think i thought about Brady
once. zach isn't the type of guy who would use people i dont think,
he's generally boyfriend material, he's cute, he's funny, he's smart,
he's sweet, he's cute... :). i dont know, i don't want a boyfriend
right now, but in&nbsp; the future he could deffinatly be a choice. oh
and he lives in BENTON not Park CITY which is great, because it's a lot
closer...meaning we will see each other a lot i hope. it was really
cute, i was leaning on his shoulder and he was tickling my ear with his
goatee and then he kissed me cheek, it was really innocent like, and
then i turned towards him and pulled him in and we kissed. it was
better than last time. he asked me if i liked him and i said naw....not
a bit and he said he felt the same way, it was funny. i dotn know,
maybe i'm just being giddy like a little school girl, but tonight was
the best. i can't wait to see him tomorrow night. when i told him i
kinda wanted him to stay at bretts because i needed a protecter he
acted like he was all for it, it was really cute. oh and we made out
for like a hour and you know what else was great...he didn't once go
for my boobs.<br>
he's only been with one girl, it's really sweet. i have to say i have a new crush and it's a big one :).<br>

i'm happy tonight :). I finally talked to Zach again and we're for sure
hanging out tomorrow. he really wants me to wear my circle football
shirt, and i'm goin to, he's goin to wear his too, we'll be matching
like we're a couple, it's insane. i asked him tonight where he was
going to college and he told me butler, that he got a scholarship to go
to bethany but he didn't want to becuase it's so far away and so
expensive. i said maybe it's a good thing that you didn't go to salina
for bethany because his car wouldn't be able to make it, and he said
yeah it would suck, your truck couldn't make it either. it was so cute,
and i said something about not liking him and he got really defensive
asking me why, and i told him i was kidding, that of course i liked
him. i'm really psyched for tomorrow, i am really excited to see him
again, and i like to think he's excited to see me too. it's gonna be
funny, we're taking my truck and listening to a ghetto little portable
radio because my car radio doesn't work. i'm gonna bring some blankets
and maybe there will be a little cuddling. ahh what a nice day.<br>
tonight i prepped for my date, i shaved my legs and my arms, i waxed
and i even gave me a pedicure. first dates are the best, i haven't been
so nervous for a date in a long time...since i think brady and my first
date goin to where else....the drive in.<br>
i guess i had an 'i miss brady day' today, he looked so nice in his
cowboy get up. i just wanted to grab onto him and never let him go, but
it was pointless to want to be near him because he doesn't care at all
now.&nbsp; then today i went to see his mom whom i love to death, i
miss her like crazy, and i didn't expect to see brady come in, i really
was hoping that he wouldn't but he did, and then i missed hugging him
even more, but i sucked it up. tonight i watched the girl next door and
when it was the sex part i started to cry, it made me miss him because
we have made love to this movie before. i'll be ok as soon as it's the
weekend and i dont have to see him, then i wont think about him as much
as i did before.<br>
anyway, gotta get some beauty sleep before my big date tomorrow.<br>
i'll update you asap.<br>
goodnight.<br>

sorry I didn't update you the other night when I said I would, I was
working so I didn't have time. Zach and I didn't get to hang out Sunday
night, he doesn't have caller id and he lost my number, so he called me
today from jason's phone. He told me he would call me tonight sometime
and I'm excited. Yay.<br>
<br>
i bought some chapstick that made me think of him and he thought it was
cute, not strange, but nice that I wanted to be reminded of him. And
then today I went to goodwill with brynn and I found a circle football
shirt just like his and I got it... 99 cents what a steal. i told him
about that too, and he wants me to wear it when we go out. he said he'd
wear his too and we could be matching. I guess friday night we're goin
to the drive in, I'm totally psyched to spend all that time with him,
he's a blast. and then saturday night is prom night, i decided not to
go so that night instead me + brynn + clinton are all going to hooters
so that clinton will be able to get out, he doesn't know yet though, i <br>
think brynn and I are going to kidnap him, he's going to have a lot of fun. <br>
<br>
i have felt rather productive today, i cleaned my closet, cleaned all
the trash out of my truck, washed all my laundry, straightened my
hair... it's a lot more than i usually do. i think zach's voice made me
get a rush of energy. &lt;3. I really can't wait to see him again.<br>
well thanks for listening to my blab.<br>

i met the coolest guy ever, well i've known him for quite a while, but
then last night we started talking a little and then making out a lot.
and tonight he came back to the party where i was and he is so cute! we
went into brett's house and watched city slickers, i only got to hang
out with him for like 45 mins, and that sucks. but it's ok, he's coming
over tomorrow, i think it will be fun.<br>
brady called and bitched me out today, it just makes me realize that
things did suck with us. i didn't even get excited when he called, i
was like oh god, what does he want now. i mean&nbsp; of course i miss
him, but i dont think i'm in love wiht him anymore either, and it's ok.
i'm having fun.<br>
so back to zach. he's sooo soooo soo cute, he has really dark hair and
eyes, he's as tall as me, he has a goatee and it's hot, he has the
hugest cheek dimples i've ever seen, and he has a pretty nice body,
he's not like fat or anything, but he's not boney either, he's just
cuddley. and i love to cuddle with him. <br>
out of all the guys last night, zach was the only one who didn't try
any moves, he just stood there and talked with me, i felt horrible that
i called him jason... he's so much better than jason, he's not the
kinda guy who like uses people, i can tell, he's just the genuine sweet
guy. i remember when he was talking with blake i thought he was so dang
cute, but i knew he liked her, so i didn't ever try to get anything out
of it. but now i want to hang out with him a lot, there is nothing
better than a new crush.<br>
did i mention he's a SUPER GOOD kisser, holy hell.<br>
ahh i can't wait to hang out with him tomorrow, he can make me laugh soo much.<br>
he graduated highschool at christmas time...yes he's smart and funny, who would of ever thunk it. <br>
he was an exterminater and tonight he used the line on me 'have you
ever had sex with a bug killer' and i thought i was gonna pee my pants,
he made me laugh so much. ahh well he's comin over early tomorrow so
i'll update you tomorrow night.<br>
ahhh<br>
love always/ dreaming about zach &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3<br>

today i got my heart checked out by a specialist and they said i'll be ok, i just have to go back in 2 years for another echocardiogram. wish me luck in 2 years.

i need to do my hair. tonight should be fun, anything to get me to stop thinking about how much i dislike him now.

until tomorrow, i bid thee a good night."

UM NO! i wanted an alone date this weekend, just him and I...like old times, and HE wanted to party, he didn't even act like he knew me at the party. That hurts so bad.

<br>
last night during me break i called brady, i told him i just longed to
hear his voice, i asked him to please come by my job so that i could
see him. he told me no over and over and over. so i no longer had my
hopes up. while i was doing my closing procedures at work I saw a car
pull into the drive way, a red car. I looked out at the car and
expected the people in it to come in and try to order pizza, however
they never got out of their car, I figureded they were waiting on
someone to give them a ride home so I payed no more attention. When I
walked out of the door i looked at the car again and I instantly felt
my heart flutter, i knew who it was, Brady. I gave a big smile and i
got into the car, we sat and talked and then I asked him if he would be
my boyfriend again, he said yes, if you don't mess up again. I was
ecstatic.<br>
<br>
we made up and we are back together, I am so thankful.<br>
<br>
i never want to fukup again. i love him.<img src=""http://www.wkozak.com/Colour%20Drawings%20GIF/Heart%20Fixed72.gif""><br>

Kelli told me how she felt about the thing, about not wanting me to hurt her son, and she told me she would still love me even if brady and i aren't together. that made me feel better because I love her to death. We held each other and cried for about 5 mins and just let each other know we loved each other. Then brady and i were left alone to talk, I sat by him on the couch and i asked what do we do now, he told me he still wasnt' sure, he said a part of him wants to be with me, the other part doesn't know if it can take being hurt again. Then he held me while i cried and cried. we stood outside and hugged and then i told him if this was goin to be the last day i could be with him could i just kiss him again, it was the most moving kiss in my life, and i cried when our lips met, i cried and cried, then i just couldn't take it, i had to leave. i'm hopeful ya know that we'll be together, but then i'm so scared he wont be with me. he told me he would call me tonight.

"event","i talked to him this morning, i begged for him to come and talk to me for 30 minutes, i asked him to please let me try to make things better. he told me he didn't think he could go through this again and that he didn't know if he would talk to me. i dont understand how he said he needed the weekend to be alone and think about things yet hang out with katy, wouldn't that just confuse things more? i laid in bed and cried for an hour and then my dad came home, he was so pissed that i was crying. he started to ask me about all of mine and brady's break ups, he asked me whose fault was the first one and I told him mine, becuase I was at a party when that guy kissed me and brady dumped me, we got back together however the next day. He asked about the second break up and I told him that brady dumped me and started to hang out with Katy again, and then we got back together a week or so after. He asked about the third break up and I told him that Brady dumped me and started to hang out with Katy again, and he took her to prom last year. He asked about the fourth and I told him that it was my fault because I moved back to Utah (he dated Katy again until I moved back and then he left her for me). He asked about the 5th break up and I told him it was my fault, it was a month ago and we broke up for a day (yes he started to hang out with Katy again then too). Then he asked about this break up and I told him that it wasn't all my fault, becuase it truly wasn't, I didn't want to break up with Brady, I wanted a few days for myself to think, I wanted to think about what I wanted for my life. He told me he couldn't give me the time I wanted, becuase he didn't want to wait around on me. Brady was the first one this time to mention 'dating other people' and then he was the first one who said 'maybe we should just break up'. I never once used either of those phrases, yet i'm the bad guy yet again, all i asked for was some Megan time, some real just alone time to get my head together. But here i am giving him all the time in the world and he couldn't give me a day. Sometimes I wonder, is this real love? how can you love someone and if have a spat you're instantly rebounding that night? it hurts me to even think about hanging out with someone else. he says that he loves me so much and everything, but I don't think he's truly proved it with what he did over the week. 

i promised to him that I wouldn't let him see or hear about me being with other guys. however he is flaunting katy in front of me. I dont understand how one girl can have such a hold on him. i mean i would ask him just to hold my hand in front of her and he wouldn't, he told me he was worried about her feelings, i dont understand how her feelings getting hurt is so much worse than mine getting hurt...when i was his girlfriend. I dont understand why he didn't tell me that she had been calling him or messaging him on Ichat. i dont understand how he could act like he's never ever loved me like he did this weekend. i have given him everything. i have tried so hard to make him happy. this just goes back to the 'giving 50%' thing, and i truly feel that sometimes he doesn't give over 30%. I understand that sometimes you can be tired and now want to go out, but why act like you're ashamed for people to see us together. i've never been ashamed of him, ever, I was so proud to take him out and show everyone that we were happy and that i loved him. 

holy shit he just called."

i officially don't know what to think right now. i am praying and
praying that we will be together. i miss him so much. last night when i
got home from school i typed him a really long letter and i put a
picture of us at the bottom of it, and then i went to walmart and i
bought a stuffed cow toy ( i think subconsiously i was trying to tell
him that i'm fine with a cowboy for my husband). then i went and picked
out some fake flowers...yes they were hidious. then i found a card and
it explained everything so closely. in the card i wrote that i would
love him until the flowers i gave him died and then I wrote in
parenthesis that the flowers wouldn't ever die...becuase they were
fake. also for valentines day he got me a book of coupons and he told
me that he would do anything that those coupons said. so i ripped out
the forgive and forget coupon and i wrote in the card that he said he
would honor those cards so i told him not to break him promise to me. i
put those all in his car today while he was working, i just laid them
on his seat and i left. the funny thing was that the card i got him for
valentines day was laying on the dashboard, i found it odd, but maybe
he was reading it while trying to figure out what i wanted.<br>
<br>
i love him so fn much, i hope that my suprise touched his heart in someway.<br>

Looking in your eyes
Praising every moment because you're my only light
Reading through stares at your passion that bears me now
Shedding no little tears
The silence scares us more than leaving could

[Chorus:]
Come back
Please don't leave me now
I'll be all that you need in life
Because I can't live without you and
I know all that you need
I can give you everything
When you're so far you'll forget about me

Waiting by your side
Knowing every moment is closer to your flight
Upset with the past, but it's all that holds us now
Believing no lies, telling each other we'll be fine forever

[Chorus]

But I'll wait
I could never leave those beautiful eyes
I know you're sorry
I know what you must be going through
And I feel sorry for you

But please don't leave me now [x3]

couldn't of gone worse i dont think. I told myself over and over he'd
be back with her, and guess who the hell he was walking with today
*ding ding ding* yes, katy fucking long. and yesturday do you know what
he asked me to do, he told me that he didn't want to know when i start
talking with someone and that he didn't want to see it, and I told him
that I didn't want to see him with Katy. but i sure as hell did. how
could he be 'so in love with me' when he ONCE AGAIN goes off and
rebounds the very next day. can he never just be alone?! EVER. honestly
it's as if he's scared to not have a girlfriend. And the fact that he
said 'fuck you' to me was really harsh, you dont tell people you love
that. Thus making me come to the conclusions that 1. he was talking to
katy behind my back, becuase she wouldn't just jump up and go chat with
him from nothing. and 2. that he never truly did love me, even though
he swore up and down he did. God I love him so much, but I can't deal
with this, I can't deal with the fact that he believe i never
appreciated him, I always thanked him for what he did. So maybe it is
the right thing...us not being together, becuase what he did was harsh.<br>
<br>
so guess who might be hanging out with another guy this weekend. Yes.
Me. if he can move on that fast then why the hell can't i. it will
hurt, i know it will, but i have to do it, i have to stop wondering
whqat him and katy are doing. i doubt i'll even have fun. but i need to
do it. wish me luck.<br>

I want him to want to still be with me, I want him to try. I want him

tonight i ache for his arms to hold me so bad. i long to kiss his gentle lips and look into those beautiful eyes, i miss his voice. and his hands, i wish he would hold me and let me cry right now, and tell him that i'm sorry, but this is what i need. i need to findout what life without him is like, only for a little bit, i need to stop using him as my 'lifeline' and start to stand on my own two feet, he's all i've known for the past two years. before him i had no love for men, i pretty much despised them due to being burned before, but he turned it around, he made me believe that i could be loved, not just used. he made me feel beautiful. i dont want it to be the end, but i feel that if he does move on quickly then it is, i'm not willing to move on yet. i just wanted some Megan time, to figure out what I want when I grow up, if i could put him and i on pause then i would, just to see what i want in life, what i generally need to be satisfied.

sometimes at night i feel like a black cloud floats above my head and i get depressed, i feel as if it's raining in my soul, no not raining pouring in my soul. it hurts. i put on a show to everyone that i'm happy, when i'm not. i'm low, lower than the earthworms in the damp dirt. i feel nauseous with who i have become compaired to who i was. i wish i could turn back time to the day i came into the world and make it right, make my life seem so less chaotic and horrible. i hate these confusing thoughts that run through my head. i wish i was alone, so that i could figure everything out, most days i wish i could be alone forever and never have to ever come back to this horrible world. some days i wish i didn't live because then i wouldn't feel so small and pathetic. i feel that i will never amount to anything, i think i will always be the girl that people will point at and say, 'Yes, she fucked up my life', because that's what i do, i hurt people and i wish i couldn't and wouldn't do it."

I know that i love him, there is no question in my heart, the only question that i have is that is he the one i'm supposed to be with forever? that's the only question. i guess if we are supposed to be together then we will, it's as simple as that, but as of right now, it really doesn't make this pain ease."

my tonsils... well the spot where I used to have tonsils. I hate this,
i'm hurting so bad! I keep throwing up blood and I can't keep any
liquids down, and it that keeps happeneing then i'll have to go stay
the night in the hospital....not a good thing.<br>
<br>
Brady has been more than wonderful, he came and seen me yesturday and
stayed with me both times until I feel asleep, he would get me anything
I wanted and he held me when I hurt. Today I puked and he rubbed my
back and kept asking me how I felt, He sat in the bathroom while I
showered and talked to me to make sure I was ok. He is so great and I
dont know what i'd do without him. I never felt more taken care of in
my life. I can see us being married and him taking care of me everytime
I get sick, he would hold me every night until I felt better.<br>
<br>
I guess I was allergic to some of the meds I was taking and that's what
was makin me so sick, i was shaking uncontrollably. Luckily we found
out what to do and what would make me feel better, otherwise i was
gonna get a suppository, yes the thing up your bum, and that wasn't a
good thing. <br>
<br>
Anyway, the meds are kickin in and i'm tired, if i get more energy i'll be sure to write.<br>

My ex best friend who we will call Helga has gotten into some bad drugs and I was worried about her so I told my mom that I heard that, NOT knowing my mom would say something to this girls mom. Now I fear that I'm going to get jumped or beat up at parties. It's crap.

Besides that I dont think I'm having a bad day. That's all."

"event","Tonight was fun hanging out with Brady.

I wish I wasn't so down lately about myself. I honestly feel like he could be with a better looking girl. And he told me that if he wanted to be with a better looking girl then he would but he wants to be with me...does that mean he thinks Katy IS a lot better looking than I am? That was really bothering me, because I'm scared taht if we were having sex he was wishing I looked like Katy or something. I don'tthink i'm the only person who wonders this but damn is it bothering me. Oh well. I'll have to deal with me, this is how God made me so I have to deal with it, unless I get a jillion dollars then i'll get a total face and body reconstruction and i'll look like jennifer lopez. ahh that would be great."

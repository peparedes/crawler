I can't put my finger on it yet but there is just somethin I like. =) ..no okay here....i like how im a loser w you and you still like me. I like how im not scared to tell you what i think and you still like me. I like that i can call you and wake you up every morning at 7:00 and you STILL like me =) I like how I can chill w you and your friends and you're not different like most guys are. (I love your friends btw, they are pretty awesome guys) but those aren't even the start of it all.

"event","Might I suggest taking a look at a very interesting PhD thesis entitled, ""Evolution, Monism, Atheism and the Naturalist World-View."" 

The purpose of the thesis study is as described: 

""The purpose of this study is to determine the degree to which the world's leading evolutionary biologists believe in traditional religion, naturalism, and the philosophical implications of their science. A further goal will be to understand how they reconcile these disparate and often conflicting beliefs with their teaching and practice of evolutionary biology."" 

The study was conducted by Dr. Gregory Walter Graffin III (PhD Cornell University) A.K.A., Greg Graffin, the lead singer of Bad Religion.

It'ss a pretty intersting study and the fact that it was conducted by the lead singer of one the most kick ass punk bands ever just makes it that much cooler.

Subsequently this journal will likely be neglected.

It will likely include none of the mundane, personal, bullshit that I've put into this journal and instead more general musings on various affairs and samples of some of my writing work. More info on that once I get it up and running...and yeah I know what some of you are thinking...but I promise this won't be a flash in the pan thing like The Brown and Gold site was."

"event","It has been a very relaxing birthday today and a little animation domination will be the perfect way to cap it off.

I experieced a birthday miracle today, I woke up rested and refreshed with no hangover, despite being very liberal with the drink last night...as some of you witnessed.

But I did have a lot of fun last night, and I got to see some old friends and made some new ones. Plus the Pistons won.

Tim on the other hand did not sure my good fortune and has pretty much been dead on his feet. Perhaps he contracted my hangover on top of his own.

So here I am another year older...and I suppose that's really it, once you hit that 21 milesotne, what else is there...40? 50? I suppose from here on its just about racking up the years and hanging on as long as you can.

So as I reflect on the past 22 years of my life...I think a few words from those San Francisco punks the Swingin' Utters would be in order:

I guess it's all right
That we never know
Just what it all means
And if there are ways
Of making a change
Please show them to me

So if I could stop time
Then I would stay 21
Cause everyday since that time
I wished I was young..."

"event","Well, I'm pushing a month since my last update so I figure I should throw you kids a bone...the primary reason for the lack of updates is that I've been sans a computer for the better part of a month. After finally getting my laptop back from repairs, it promptly and quite literaly, caught fire. So back it went to the repair center, I may not be a computer expert but I figured something was amiss when smoke started coming out the side...but anyways, the computer is back for good now *knock wood*.

Anyway, I'm still looking for gainful employment here in Kalamazoo, but its looking like I'll be able to land a job up at Shakespeare's sometime this week. 

I've been working on a lot of short fiction lately, and I've really been enjoying it. I'm currently working on a few different pieces that I'll narrow to one, and submit for fellowship consideration for the Prague program next summer.  But that's not due for awhile.

In the meantime, I'm working on some other short fiction that I plan on sending to various periodicals, including Playboy, Harper's, The New Yorker etc., that accept unsolcited short fiction. Really just for shits and giggles, but then again you never now. I figure it can't hurt, since I already missed the deadline for the Playboy college fiction contest, I might as well send some stories in now, rather than wait until next year...I'd be happy just with a rejection letter, at least I'll know they actually read it then.

My birthday is on June 5th (this coming Sunday), no solid plans yet, but at the very least I hope to spend it drinking my way around Kalamazoo with all you kids and others.

But, I've also been thinking about going to the Tiger game that day with a group and hitting the bars in the Detroit area, if there's any interest in something like that let me know...otherwise, I just hope to spend it one way or the other with all my people."

As for the title of this little entry, that comes from a little gem of a program we discovered on GR public access proving that, given a video camera, anybody can make a hilarious program without even trying. Who would've thought the gangsta rap seen in GR would be so hardcore?

All in all a good weekend...Bronco basketball tomorrow night against Texas Christian...hopefully the all hoops weekend will end on a positive note."

Bear in mind we hadn't planned on being there that long, just planned on getting some wings for lunch and playing a little trivia...Well that turned into a little more trivia, which turned into a few beers, which turned into more trivia, more beer, more wings...and eight hours later I was on my way to Shakespeare's for Kobie's little shin dig. Beal bailed on Shakespeare's for some reason, but whatever. Got to Shakespeare's and played some more trivia with Mike for awhile, but mostly just hung out drank some beers and chilled it was a good time. 

Went back to 1420 for a bit, Kobie let me try on his pack and helmet...that shit is heavy.

Don't know what today will bring, other than cleaning the apartment, maybe 1420 tonight or maybe I'm gonna try and find a bar with the WMU game on.

My buddy Noveck is gonna come up tomorrow, maybe we'll hit the camo party...although I don't think I'm gonna have any cammo, because I really don't feel like spending the money on it."

Oh yeah, Nate and I went to Hooters for lunch and I dropped fifteen bucks, with no booze involved, who would've thought mediocre bar food would be so expensive. Apparently our waitress knew Nate, although his knowledge of their apparent relationship was shaky at best, and he just had to play along the whole time. It was amusing."

After the game Mr. Beal took us out to dinner, along with Beal's sister and her friend. I'll tell you that man's hospitality knows no bounds. Always class, and always a good time with the Beal's.

The trip back was a little nuts...Snow on 69 south was outrageous, visibility of MAYBE 20 feet...needless to say, that made for some tense driving. Then all of a sudden it cleared and we didn't see any snow the rest of the way, but we ended up chilling at a rest stop for about two hours just to regroup after that little episode.

I have less than a year to write my ass off and produce a worthy entry.

After that, it's just a couple more classes then the weekend has come once again...What will it bring? I do not know, but I've already heard talk of more than few parties deserving of my presence, but we'll probably kick it off as usual with a little home bar action this evening, and then I wouldn't mind going to Waldo's again if other people are down, had some good times there last week.

Oh and of course Western vs. Central on the hardwood this week, Western's been slumping, but hopefully they can turn it around against the fucking Chips...should be epic.

A lot of fun last night hanging at Waldo's, Newcastle and pitchers of Gin & 7-UP are always good. Saw a ton of people I knew there, most writers and former colleagues of mine at the paper, and some old friends who I hadn't seen in a year or more...all in all great times last night.

I thought some Swingin' Utters lyrics might capture the spirit of the night:


As I walked alone in Camden
The city's sights and smells did permeate my senses
I stepped inside the local off license
And proceeded with ample gallon in my hand
We drank to the brink of dawn
And wallowed in the crimson bliss
Shouted, laughed and sang for hours
""How had I ever missed this?""
A fetching femme fatale in green glass
Turns me into a graceless gymnast
A sanguine mood turns into a sanguinary thirst
But I'd never wish to lift this vampiric curse."

FINALLY cleaned my apartment, its looking pretty good, though I wonder if anybody is ever going to see it, since nobody ever comes to see me.

Anyways, was lazy pretty much all day today, saw Rachel at the Bernhard center for all of a nano-second, shortest meeting between two people ever...but its still nice to run into people you know at random times.

Road tripped it down to Elkhart, Indiana with Ian tonight to watch two Broncos recruits hoop it up against each other, had a good time, and it provided decent enough fodder for an article to set the site off in its new direction.

I'll be doing the Bronco hoops thing tomorrow, but as part of the new direction of the site I won't be doing a recap of the game, probably more of a column/feature instead.

Anyways, off to bed because I've got BIO lab tomorrow...always fun.

Big thanks to Shavonne for driving me back to Beal's last night and back to Kobe's this morning to get my car, and thanks to Mike for getting me to pass out on the couch instead of the floor.

Came home this morning to a somewhat surprising message on the IM...and it really made me realize something, a situation can really only be awkward from my perspective, if I decide to make it awkward, or percieve it as so...I don't ever want my friends to feel like they have to apologize for their actions, when I'm really the one at fault...because truth be told I would've done the exact same thing if the roles were reversed.

Rose bowl in about an hour, then who knows. I hope for some more fun tonight."

Anyways, like I said I'll be going home until after Christmas, the fact that I can make $20 an hour for the next week working for my Dad is just too great to pass up...plus I really need the money.

So if anybody needs me, you know my cell or number or should know people who do...I'll try and get online when I can, but it probably won't be much, but feel free to call the cell anytime.

Happy Holidays, bitches. Peace"

step one: slit my throat
step two: play in my blood
step three: cover me in dirty sheets
and run laughing out of the house
step four: stop off at edgebrook creek
and rinse those crimson hands
you took me hostage and made your demands
i couldn't meet them so you cut off my fingers

"event","So, I'm a little late on this one but oh well...

Thursday was supposed to be my last two final exams, but thanks to my ever increasing ability to complicate my life, I slept through my morning exam and had to take it on Friday morning...this of course came after a long night celebrating the not quite end of the semester at 1420...

1420, wow some crazy shit happened that night...some things I regret (see Jeremy's journal) and I mistook Beal for Ron Artest...but that was kinda funny. I think I did find my new calling, along with Tim, working the bar at Club 1420...we both had a blast doing that.

Saturday, not much doing during the day, went up to GR with Mike and Beal, and drank a lot of free beer and ate a lot of free food at the Beal family Christmas party good times. Came home this afternoon in time to watch the Lions blow a 13-0 halftime lead at Lambeau and lose 16-13 to the Packers. That leaves the lions 0 for the last 13 years at Lambeau. Pathetic.

I've also come to the realization that I have two options right now, option the first: I can continue to pine over completely unattainable people and throw away the opportunity for a great friendship. Or, option the second: I can stop worrying about things that I can't attain in one aspect, and work on building a relation ship in another way. Option one, leaves me miserable and frustrated. Option two, leaves me with the potential for a great friendship.

I think the choice is clear..."

Anyways, team Cool Club is 2-0 in the Sunday bowling league...as if you'd expect anything different.

No finals Monday or Tuesday, but a whole lot of studying and probably not much else, so that kind of sucks, but the semester is almost done, so I can't complain.

Really want to get a bass, but I don't think the folks will get me one, not after the previous failed guitar experiment from high school, so I think I'll probably have to gather up the cash I get from relatives and wait until after Christmas.

I also want some DVD's and clothes and shit, that I will get from my folks...

But in reality there's only one thing that I want for Christmas, and I'd glady trade all that other stuff to get it, but I think there's a better chance of me getting crushed by Jupiter, than there is of me actually getting it...Alas.

That aside...

Thanksgiving was nice, 5 days at home was a pretty long stretch for me, but it was nice. Just good to get away from everything. While I was home, I was also able to get the breaks replaced on my car, and put the snow tires on, so I'm ready to combat another Kzoo winter, with my four cylinders of fury.

Of course, now that I'm back I'm left to face the last week of classes and final exams, should just be tons of fun as always. 

Still trying to figure out what's going to be happening in terms of a writing job, hopefully I can get some steady work with the Gazette soon. I've also been thinking about starting my own internet publication, just for fun if nothing else, but it'd be cool if I could really get something solid on developed...more on that later though. And of course...my novel is always a work in progress.

Oh and I got new glasses when I was home, nothing too different, but I still refuse to be enslaved by contacts.

I'm kinda dissapointed to find out that so many people are planning to go out tonight, kind of made me wish I was still in Kzoo. But then, I thought to myself what the appeal of being hungover on Thanksgiving was, and I couldn't think of a good reason, why anybody would want to be hungover on Thanksgiving...Before they start drinking for the Lions game that as...Because lets face it, its going to take a lot to get through that one.

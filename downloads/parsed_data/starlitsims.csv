The cemetery, Colma Graves.

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/Storage_Closet/sf/Image2.png"">
Based off my grandma's house.


Basically, there will be a few different areas: The Sunset District (mainly housing, but includes Colma Graves and a small park [Lake Merced]), Sea Cliff (mainly housing, but much nicer), The Embarcadero (shops... for those with OFB I'll put small apartments over the shops), Haight St. (more stores), Hunter's Point/Balboa (lower income housing), and some random other things (ex: Golden Gate Park).

<b>Edit</b> Thank you, <lj user=""otakuastra"">, for reminding me about Castro. That has to be added :-D

Any interest? Any requests?

I'm using the <a href=""http://www.modthesims2.com/showthread.php?p=1781499&amp;highlight=neighborhood#post1781499"">AnyGameStarter</a>, so even those with the base game will be able to download the city (explaining my grandma's house with ROOM for a garage, but no garage). I'm only using one custom object, and that's a set of wallpaper from HolySimoly.

Again, it's not really a story legacy... or really funny at all. Just random comments. I don't have enough time to touch up the pictures or be witty.

"event","So I cleaned out this journal, because there's no use having a dead legacy laying around. Le sigh. I just don't have time for a legacy right now. I mean, I haven't actually PLAYED the Sims since <b>June!</b> I like my job, but it's a real time consumer (and add 10 credits of college classes in).


But over the past few months I haven't completely been away from the Simming process. I always am downloading clothes and binning new hair (why, I really don't know, as again- never have time to play!). I also created a set of default face template replacements (which can be found <a href=""http://modthesims2.com/showthread.php?t=246917"">here</a>). I want to make a few more sets in the future, but that one alone took me 3 months. I think it'll be a while before I get around to another one. :-)

Around June I made a new dorm because... well, Maxis dorms suck x10.

<small>A legacy in story-format.</small>

<lj-cut text=""Click to enter 1969"">

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/Storage_Closet/cosmos/prologue/Image2.jpg"">
Meadow was born in 1953, and like many teenagers of her time, had fallen into a mentality of ""tuning in and dropping out."" The previous year showed the deaths of two national heroes- Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F Kennedy. The country was torn apart, epitomized by the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Many teenagers- those not in school and leading walkouts, spent much of their time wandering around the country, seeing it through an endless drug haze.

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/Storage_Closet/cosmos/prologue/Image8.jpg"">
Her boyfriend, Kenneth, was a year younger than her- fifteen, not sixteen. He was another wanderer, rebelling against the ""conformity"" of the 1950s. Too many suburbs; too many refrigerators; too many microwaves; too many Nash Ramblers. He was tired of wearing ""dog tags"" to school- the teachers told you they were if you were found lost, and couldn't identify where you lived. In reality, the government was issuing them in case a nuclear bomb were to be dropped by the Soviets, and the survivors were left to ID the bodies. He hated it all. Needless to say, once his older brother introduced him to the likes of The Beatles and Janis Joplin, he found that he had fallen into the counterculture.

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/Storage_Closet/cosmos/prologue/Image14.jpg"">
Instead of spending their time at school, they spent their time at each other's empty houses, drinking and smoking and flipping and shrooming. They accumulated a small base of friends- a little more than half a dozen. They were never alone; always surrounded by those that understood their thoughts on the President, Lyndon B Johnson, and the war in Vietnam. They felt themselves to be new-age philosophers.

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/Storage_Closet/cosmos/prologue/Image16.jpg"">
Their world was beautiful. They could take acid and sit in a lit room, nothing moving. But it was as if static had erupted around them- they were inside the wrong channel on a television. They could move the fan with their eyes. They could dance and laugh for eight hours. Auditory and visual hallucinations encompassed their world. 

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/Storage_Closet/cosmos/prologue/Image18.jpg"">
Meadow and Kenneth felt as if they knew what real love truly was- not what their parents felt. Not what Romeo and Juliet felt. No one felt as amazing as they did. No one in the history <b>of</b> love could possibly fathom this feeling. Everything was so beautiful.

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/Storage_Closet/cosmos/prologue/Image43.jpg"">
After hitchhiking from Colorado to San Francisco, they found themselves in another world. People there did things Meadow and Kenneth hadn't even thought about- sitting down on the sidewalk and taking a nap. They walked down the street smoking and selling weed. People walked up to perfect strangers and propositioned them for sex- which was often accepted! What amazed outsiders was a way of life for insiders.

Mars was born in 1970. They felt that it sounded like a name of strength- regardless of the fact Mars was a God, not a God<i>ess</i>, and was, in fact, the God of war. Meadow coddled her at all times. However, the drugs never stopped.

She would toss Mars into the air and catch her on the descent, feeling as if she was seeing it through slow-motion, and couldn't drop the toddler. She, luckily, never did.

They tried making a semi-decent life for the child, often panhandling on the streets or playing guitar. Local business owners called the police or shooed them away themselves. Kenneth rairly made any money.

In 1972, they cleaned up and found entry-level jobs at several stores. They raised Mars in a one bedroom apartment in an area known as Hunter's Point- gang and drug infested. By 1980, however, disco had a trance on the world. Though they were both in their mid-twenties, Meadow and Kenneth found themselves back in the scene.

Mars followed them to the clubs. They figured that it would be fine bringing her- ""as long as she wasn't exposed to the drugs, what could hurt?""

They, however, did not take care in shielding her from this. They would disappear to the bathroom twice an hour. As they'd duck into it, they were chewing on their lips. Once coming back, however, they'd scoop her into the air, laughing. Meadow would ramble about absolute nonsense the entire time, while Kenneth seemed to take up a slight case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

By the mid-eightees, Mars had this way of life embedded into her. She was used to going to clubs several times a week by the time she was fifteen. When she told her friends this, they glanced disbelievingly at her. Some tossed comments that confused her. <I>Didn't their parents take them, too?</i>

While she enjoyed the atmosphere at the time, she would later find herself breaking away from her parents' way of life. She would form her own morals. She would start seeing her parents as what they were- selfish asses that never gave her a regular childhood."

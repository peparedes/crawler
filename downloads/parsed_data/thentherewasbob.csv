It's Bob-DAMNED TRUE!

I am back, and better than ever, bitches.

So you know what's awesome? Being able to support yourself. I live on my own, and can have my friends over at will... it rocks pretty hardcore.

I swear I'm going to update again soon, as I have a plan.

So... for the first time in literally over a year...

HAVE A NICE DAY!"

"event","So, we saw ""Good Shepard"".... for three and a half hours... Yeah... not fun. Bad Movie, only thing that saved it, was us makign fun of it.

It was good to see Austin and Megan again, they were fun, as usual. And kept us entertained. I woned the arm rests, and the thearter.

More later, overall, despite the movie, I had the best night in a long time."

In other news, Within the month, I will have a car. My friend Nick is selling me his van, which looks pretty crappy, but runs really well. It's not a convertable, but it runs well, and should last me a while. Besides, I owe everyone rides for the rest of eternity, this way, I can fit you all in at once, heh.

I'm gonig to Atlanta next weekend. DragonCon calls me. Basiclly, if you didn't know, my brother and I play card games, specificly and mainly, WWE Raw Deal. Sept 2nd is a World Championship qualifier, and we're going. Last year, it was in Orlando, and my brother was one win away from going to the world championships. Hopefully, my s3cr3t t3ch is enough to win this year, as a free trip to Detroit and awesome tickets for Wrestlemania for my brother and I would be frickin' awesome.

I'm making more of an effort lately to hang out with people, as I'm working alot, and have noticed I'm in grumpy moods. I think it's from lack of Social Exposure, and I refuse to go down like that. If anybody wants to hang out or anything... just give me a call, an e-mail, or hell, leave a message on here, I'll get it. Well, that's all the major updates, anything else is pretty meaningless and will make me sound like I'm rambling....like right now.

Have A Nice Day!"

Saw ""Depp Plays A Pirate"" part 2 and it was pretty good. The ending was a bi ""Blah"" but still good.

I'll be back in Daytona on Aug3rd, most likely work on Aug 4th, Ha!

by: Bob Theriault

Life is a Paradox.
Wants, Needs, and Responsibility.
Three Words, Three Ideas, Three Differences.
Balance The Three, Live Happily.

Life Is A Conundrum.
A Question Without Answer.
Life Rings With Questions,
Life Lays Silent Without Answers.

Life Is A Riddle.
An Odd Situation, An Odd Solution.
The Mind Cannot Break The Code.
The Body Cannot Move Without The Resolution.

Life Is A Contradiction.
Gaining By Losing, Hurting By Loving.
Sacrificing For Nothing, Waiting For No One.
Living Only To Die, Dying To Live."

I figured another post would be alot easier than replying to every comment on my last post.

Thank you guys, I talked to my dad, told him what happened, and he said the nicest thing ever. ""I won't let you live here. I'm forcing you to go back.""

So, worst case scenario, I'll jsut need to find a place to live when I get back. No big deal.

Thank you again, and I love you all.

The tickets I already have to come back bring me back on July 28th.

That's all for now...

P.S. - I don't want to think about this, but If I don't come back from my Dad's house... Thank you, everyone... I love you all. You guys are my life, and I've loved every fay of every month of every year I've been here, thank you..."

"event","Holy Crap, I'm updating. 

I had half a mind to make that the update.

Anyways...

Lots-o-crap gone on since I last updated like four months ago... To save time, I'll update the latest, large events.

Clarissa's Birthday: She got to have the party she wanted, although plans changed last minute, I'm glad she still got her party. Unfortunaly, I missed a good four hours of it due to Drama's Variety Show, but then i returned, but then had to leave early. Wish I could've spent more time with everyone, but I had fun...

Drama: We had our last meeting on Thursday, and the week before that, we had the Variety Show. I worked the sound and the first night it went nearly perfect. The second Night, I made a small mistake, but Tara (Person in charge) and Andrew (person on stage at the time) didn't mind, and Tara even hugged me afterwards and thanked me. Tara's also gonig to be the president next year, and I think She'll do a good job, she seems to be an awesome person so far.

Me: Still no idea when I'm going to Dad's house, or even if i still am. Also, I -REALLY- don't like mentioning this a million times, so I'll say it once... Thursday is my 19th Birthday. Not sure what I want, you people all know me pretty well, so if you're having trouble finding somehting, just ask, but gifts are not nessicary. I don't know if there will be a party, but if there is, I'll be sure to invite as many people as possible.

Well, that's all I can think of for now, so I'll close with a hope for the Boston Celtics, possibly making the Championships a Hat Trick for Boston this year. oh yeah, and always remember to... 

Have A Nice Day!!"

Everybody that's been hangin' out with me on the one or two days I have avalible, thanks, I appriciate it. Oh, and Clarissa, thanks for one of the most fun times I've had in a while. Honestly, I haven't been able to hang out with anybody for a while, and hanging out with you was a load of fun.

Well, again, sorry for not updating, for not talking to people, and whatnot.

I love you all, and please, feel free to call me anytime, my phone's always on.

Anybody who reads this would do me a world of good to reply to this comment with a few things they would be excited to recieve from me as a gift during this holiday season, on whichever of the random holidays you celebrate.

Yeah, so I haven't felt well, and haven't been near the internet in alittle while, see a connection? I think I'm an addict, oh well.

Anywyas, work's been fun. Got suspended for a week because my mom forgot to bring me to work. Heh, but it did have a good side, the Head Chef, Kenny was arguing with Katerina, the Manager about punishing me, because I am, and I quote, ""A Fucking Good Cook, and Just Plain Nice Kid."" I like that. I might make that my offical title. Heh.

Well, Katerina went on this whole rant about how she could never trust me by myself now, and then she schedules me for Sunday, by myself, for the first time ever. I think kenny ended up winning that argument, heh. So, soon I'll be running that resturant. Heh.

Went to Seabreeze today at about 8:30 to pick up tickets for <I> The Odd Couple </I>, and ended up spending the entire school day there with my friends and the old drama kids. Had a hella lot of fun.

I hate to do this, but can anybody let me stay with them for a few days, just until I find my own place? I'd obviously reimburse you for the time I stayed, I just need to have a place to sleep in.

Then I woke up by falling out of bed and hitting my head on the nightstand, always fun. Then, Saturday, when I was actually starting to have a good day, Adam comes in on his way to homecoming. I was talking and joking with him, when he apparently took offense to one joke and KICKED ME IN THE NUTS!!! I swear, out of nowhere, he just kicked me right in the junk. Damn him, and damn not being able to sit for two days. He meant to kick my leg, but missed and crippled me momentarily. I was able to hold in crying until the cute girls were gone, but once they left, I bawled my eyes out. It was horrible. Then I had to go back to work for another three hours. It was not a good night. good news is I FINALLY get paid tomorrow, and then I work on Wednesday, finally getting schedueled at least an extra day. So, my weekend was kind abland, besides to crippling pain when I go to sit or stand. That'll pass... Oh well, since i can't seem to, i wish you...

For some reason I just felt strange last night, at first I thought it was anger, so I went outside with a large box and my sword and beat that all to hell. That was fun, but i still felt off... I decided to play Tales Of Symphonia for alittle while, but that didn't help. Then I was watching LAX, which was a surprisingly good show, and Ikept feeling like I wanted to cry. It was wierd. I just decided to go to sleep, and when I woke up this morning, I felt fine... Oh Well.

Today I'm going to learn karate with LB and Hannah. Should be quite interesting. Hannah told me it's alot of grappling and stuff, so I should be good. Then again, I'll probally just break my arm and move on. I'm at school right now, just hanging out. Haven't heard from ym stalker yet today.

The last thing I need to say is that the first game of Major League Baseball Playoffs is today. The Red Sox are taking on the Angels, and we need to win this one. This has to be the year we reverse the curse. So pray to whatever god you worship for the victory of the Sox. I'll be keeping up with the game, although it starts right before I have to go to karate. Anyways, Go SOX!

I was chillin' in the library, using their computers when I got an Instant Message from a random screen name. I asked who it was and the girl said that it was just somebody I sat next to a few days ago, and she thought I was cute so she leaned over and got my screen name 'cause she was too shy to talk to me. So, now I apparently have a stalker. Oh well, she hasn't gotten dangerous yet, so it's fine.

On another note, in the courtyard at lunch, this girl asked me to register to vote, but I already had, then she randomly asked me about a bunch of different things, and we ended up talking for a few hours. She's really cool and funny, and she lives less than two minutes from my work. She said she was gonig to come visit me tomorrow while I'm working, so that should be fun.

Now, I expect to get called an idiot for this, but it I honestly don't believe it's going to be that bad. I just have this feeling. Oh well, in any case, Mom's making us leave Daytona, which I don't want to do, since my friends will still be here, hating leaving them behind. I'd rather stay and watch myself get proven right. Oh well.

In Other News,

I'm now offically employed, and I can offically cook food for complete strangers. I got hired as a cook at Song Mongolian Grill. It's on of those cool places where i cook in front of people and do flips with the spatula and stuff. It's gonna eb fun, and according to Adam, good pay. I'm excited to start, but I'm suppsoed to start Friday, and Mom's making us run scared. I'll call them up and hopefully NOT get fired.

Well..that's all i can think, so Have A Nice Day!!"

"event","Well...been out of Florida for two weeks now. HAven't had time to update, sorry.

I got a request from Andrea to post, so here's your post.

I'm currently in my hometown, Hooksett, New Hampshire. It feels good to be home, yet, strange at the same time. I'm staying at my long-time friend's house. Jessica's a sweetheart. I'm with my old friends, in my old town, and it doesn't feel like I thought it would. I still love this though, although I can't wait to get back to Florida, and be with y friends down there again. I miss you all. Well, not feeling very inspired tonight, so I'll update later. Whomever you are, where ever you live, I miss you, I'll see you soon. Never Give Up and Always...

Have A Nice Day!!"

"event","Well, had fun yesterday. Went to L.B.'s house, and hung out with her, Ian, and Eevee. That was fun, well, besides having to walk there because I misunderstood what LB was trying to tell me...She tried to say ""Call me if you can't get a ride..."" Add in phone static and my random ignorance and that comes out, ""Sorry, I can't give you a ride."" Hung out with them, watched TV, went in the pool, good times. 

Then i got home and realized that I'm not going to be here much longer. 

Thursday I leave for Massachusetts. This sucks. I really don't want to go anymore. I like my friends down here. I can't get in touch with most of my northern friends anymore. The ones I can get in touch with are either going out of town right when i come in town, moving forever...or ust generaloly aren't good company. I'm gonna miss my Florida friends...

Then I realized something else...

I don't have many close friends that want to hang out outside of school either. I mean, all my drama friends, they'll hang out with me, sometimes. Then there's Angie, L.B. and that group, and that's about it.

Oh Well, I'll get over it, I'm sure. I always get like this right before I go back up North, but usually, I want to go back to Dad's, this time, for some reason, I'm not looking forward to it too much. Well, That's enough for now.

if you want to hang out with me today, Wednesday, the last day I'm in Florida, give me a call...603-264-6771 or just come by my house, most of you know where I live. I'll see you all soon, and as always...

Have A Nice Day!!"

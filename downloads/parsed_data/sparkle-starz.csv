Where the fuck are my results!? The wait is driving me absolutely insane!!!

On a happier note, last night television kicked ass! Season finale of Prison Break was awesome, yet annoyingly cliffhanger-y. Two new episodes of 24, both featuring the one, the only *Julian Sands*. Woohoo! That show is by far the best listening on the planet; Kieffer and Julian have the nicest voices to listen to. No, I don't think I'm wierd at all. Ahem. Anyway, he was so deliciously evil as always... and I swear that a couple of his lines were lifted straight out of Warlock. Also on 24 was the nifty Jane Espenson reference :D And the night of awesomeness continued, also including the Michelle Tratchenberg (or however you spell it) episode of House! Yayness.

Where the fuck are my results!?"

"event","Alrighty, here I am, making an entry. A short entry, that isn't really an entry but a list of things I must get to during the uni break. By writing them out, hopefully it'll motivate my ass... or at the very least save me from wading through the piles of paper on my desk(s), on the floor, on my bed, in the bathroom, in the lounge room etc etc to find the post-it with my to-do list on it. And on that note...
(1) <strike>Tidy computer room, bedroom, bathroom and lounge room</strike>
(2) <strike>Organise this semesters uni notes and text books, work out what I need for next semester</strike>
(3) Write out resume and cover letter: get me an internship somewhere!
(4) <strike>Study the road rules *again* and get me my L plates *again*</strike> hooray!
(5) <strike>Set up 2 new blogs for career purposes, remembering ""anyone can have an opinion, but it takes a talented person to write about fact""</strike> I'll settle for one at the moment, since so far it's been incredibly time consuming
(6) <strike>Learn how to put in contact lenses and get used to wearing them</strike> i can now put them in and take them out reasonably quickly, but i can't seem to get used to wearing them... Felicity's mum is going to try me on a different brand of lens to see if that makes any difference
(7) <strike>Learn how to get the songs from my ipod on to the computer, since I have a feeling my ipod may die soon</strike> yay! thanks sarah!
(8) <strike>Go shopping for a new coat</strike> woohoo! purrrdy new coat at reasonable price :)
(9) <strike>Go shopping for shoes suitable for a night out that wont give me a) frostbite, b) a broken ankle, c)crippled toes, d) all of the above</strike> all hail the ugly $12 pair of shoes! so, so tacky, but they'll do the job
(10) Watch High Tension
(11) Watch Dead Meat
(12) <strike>Watch Universal Soldier: the Return</strike> why? why!?
(13) Track down a copy of New Eden
(14) Track down a copy of Child Star
(15) <strike>Track down a copy of Bang, Bang You're Dead</strike> omg, it was actually at the video store! yay!
(16) <strike>Watch Heathers</strike> not out on dvd yet, so I'll save this for later
(17) Watch Single White Female
(18) <strike>Find a copy of the original When A Stranger Calls</strike> video shop guy says the one released is an el-cheapo crappy release, and when the proper edition comes out he'll get it in
(19) <strike>Start selling stuff on ebay</strike>
(20) <strike>Go fishing!... Apparently you need a license to do so, but to hell with that!</strike> yay! fishing! heaps of fun, despite the lack of fishing expertise and... well, fish.
(21) Go on scary harbour jet boat thingymajig
(22) Re-live as much of Angel as possible
(23) <strike>Bowling with the high school gang</strike> i officially am the worst bowler ever!
(24) Find an appropriate shelf thingy for bedroom... or something to make the room look less bare
(25) Find some nice paint/wallpaper for my room
(26) <strike>Learn how to do those line things through text so I can check things off this list as I go</strike>
(27) <strike>Buy some warm ugh-boots, and possibly learn how to spell ugh-boots</strike> cost me an arm and a leg, but sooo worth it
(28) Figure out how/where to display the many photos/autographed pictures that are off collecting dust somewhere
(29) Fix old bag or get a new bag for uni
(30) Think of one more thing to round out the list at 30 things to do
THE END"

"event","I've spent the day in a tizzy of emotions. One minute I'm midly excited about going back to uni, the next I'm stressing over all the preparation that needs to be done, then I'm sad that I've only got a couple more days of freedom, then I'm pissed off that I haven't done everything I've wanted to do during the break, then I'm worried about what's going to happen with work, then I'm nervous at the prospect of new work and...urgh. Make it stop!
So let me bore you and expand on the above:
* Excitement- I have my new timetable which has worked out quite nicely,my new pens and folders and all that jazz, and I've gone through and worked out where all my new lecture rooms and labs are, so I'm *somewhat* excited at the prospect of going back to university- only a little bit though, its the nerd and couch potato in me at war
* Stress- Going in tomorrow to pick up cards and stuff means waiting in queues,
which, ok, not so much stressfull as it is annoying, but still- it's got me writing and rewriting notes and lists like crazy. And then there's the added
troubles of being asked to do things for other people- go line up at the bookstore for Bec, go search the library for books on Mardi Gras for Jess...I just know I'm going to forget something! Also stressfull is trying to find some frickin information about what books I need for my subjects and deciding
whether or not to buy them or wait to see how badly I really need them...
* Teh Sadness- Four more days and it's back to the book-learning :( No more
lounging around... well at least no more lounging around guilt free. Granted, I haven't done that much lounging recently because of stupid work, but the 
*opportunity* to lounge without a care will once again be lost for another semester. In case you failed to notice, I like to lounge. I like to wake up with absolutely nothing on my mind but which movie to watch and how many packets of chips I can eat without anyone noticing they're missing. Sweet freedom, how I'll miss you
* Pissed-Offness- I had a list of at least 50 movies I wanted to see throughout
this break. Number of movies watched from actual list? Probably 3 or 4. Number of crappy movies I wasted my time with? Too many to count. I also planned to watch at least an entire season of either Buffy or Angel, just to get back to my fandom roots. I can count the number of episodes watched on one hand :( In non-tv-related aspects of life, I had plans to catch up with friends from highschool, but our get-together night pretty much sucked. I was meant to meet up with media friends, but also failed to do that. There were plans for starting an exercise schedule, plans to meet up with primary school buddies, plans to buy a whole new wardrobe, plans to redecorate my room... so many plans, and not a single one came to fruition. Hence my serious case of the grumps.
* Work worry- Should I reveal my true timetable to work and get bullied into
working every spare hour I have? Should I ring work right now and let them know I know my timetable, or just not show up next week, since it's clearly
written in the diary that I'm back at uni? What's going to happen once they
realise I can't work any days during the week? Should I try and get out of
Sunday shifts, but miss out on the big dollars? So many questions! And another: why should I really care? It's just a stupid part time job!
* Nervousness- Sarah and her mum have managed to score me some trial editing 
work (*waves* thanks!)but I'm a tad daunted... rang the boss lady today to
set up a meeting and it was all very official and stuff... turns out she wont
be in tomorrow so I'm gonna have to navigate my way there on Tuesday after uni... and, yes. I don't want to do a sucky job for them. What if I can't do it properly? What if, what if.. I don't know, but just the thought of it
makes me want to pee my pants :P
Also throw into the mix the feelings of hunger, sleepiness and restlessness and it makes for one hell of an emotional rollercoaster. Tomorrow I'll probably wake up totally drained, but the numbness will be a nice change of pace :D"

"event","Boring day. But I feel like I should be writing in this thing somewhat occaisonally since I made it all pretty. So let me bore you with the details: I went to work, did work related things, during my lunch break I splurged and ordered 2 sandwiches with salt, but no pepper. Stupid sandwich lady put pepper, but no salt. Yick. Did more work related things, was lectured by a scary church lady, came home, sat on ass. I did the same thing yesterday, and I'll do the same thing tomorrow. Minus the pepper. And the religious sermon. Hopefully.
In other exciting news: I love DVDs! When they were first introduced I swore I would continue to buy and watch only VHS- I didn't understand the point of them. Oh how I was lost- but now I am found! DVDs are the way, the truth and the light :D Of course I realised this yonks ago when I got hooked on the special features, but last night I sat and watched Fright Night with the tv colour set to 'movie', which made a world of difference. When I first watched it on DVD with normal colour I was picking up on a few things I hadn't been able to see with my dingy video copy, but with the proper colour settings it was like watching it for the first time! So many things going on in the background! Mirrors with no vampire reflections! Scary pictures on walls! I was in movie-buff heaven :)
In conclusion: work is boring, DVDs are the source of all that is good in the world."

"event","Hot. So very, very hot. I just had to walk home from work and I'm very, very hot. Did I mention it's hot? I walked for maybe 5 mintues before I realised I'd die if I kept my work shirt on, so I ended up basically walking home in my underwear :) Well maybe not my underwear, but under my work top I had this ratty old white singlet top which was see throught and stretched and tattered... I must have looked like such a hobo, a slutty hobo with a bright blue bra showing through her ugly worn top.
Hot. So very hot."

"event","Ah Buffy, how I've missed you! Today Ben came over with the plan to watch a couple of movies...but turns out there's absolutely nothing decent at the video shop. So after walking all the way up the road to discover such, we headed on home and ended up watching a couple of episodes of Angel (RIP Glenn Quinn!) and a couple episodes of Buffy. Bad, bad Buffy fan! It's been months and months since I've sat down and watched a complete episode- and for someone who spent literally years of her life not going a single day without watching at least one episode those months have seemed like forever. This entire break from uni I've kept meaning to get back into it but could never decide on an episode and a lot of the time got distracted by other things *glares in the direction of work*. But my Buffy-drought is no more! I've rediscovered my obsession- and with great timing too! Just a week more of holidays then it's back to uni and work and assignments and 'studying'. Poo.
Also adding to my Buffy-excitement was my discovery that Wentworth Miller, aka hot guy from Prison Break, was in the episode Go Fish... always thought he looked familiar, but could never place it- so there you go. Also of interest: Buffy was apparently his first ever acting role... and I hate to say it but his acting skills really haven't improved much (and neither has his hair cut), but that's ok, he still looks mighty fine to me :D
In other news: Foxtel sucks! Our remote control has one vital button that has just stopped working, for no apparent reason, and they're charging us something like 50 bucks for a new remote! 50 bucks! That's so outrageous, considering we've had the thing for not long at all. Dad got kinda grumpy at the man on the phone- even though it wasn't the poor guys fault that he had to follow company policy- but yeah, Dad was threatening to cancel our subscription and stuff... dude! I know paying money for the remote sucks but please don't take away my Foxtel! It's my life! Although he does have a point.. we pay a ridiculous amount of money every month, the least they can do is fix their faulty product free of charge!"

"event","Today I finally got around to seeing House of 1000 Corpses and I have to say I really wasn't impressed. It was meant to be one of the most gory and scary horror movies made in recent times but really all it was was a bunch of wierdly made-up actors prancing around wailing about fried chicken and some guy called Dr. Satan. It really didn't make any sense, especially at the end when it went from being a movie about a bunch of teenagers being hacked to bits by a family of psychos (Texas Chainsaw much?)to a movie that had reanimated corpses that performed brain surgery in an underground layer full of wierd-ass creatures and insane people. I can't imagine what the Devils Rejects must be like...
In happier news I was pleasantly surprised by the Toolbox Murders... not so much a remake but more a revisioning, and done a lot better than the original might I add. Being a Tobe Hooper film I was expecting a lot of mindless blood and guts but actually the death scenes were really quite creative- there were nail guns and drills and buzz saws, oh my! Also I never really looked to see who was in it so when Juliet Landau came on screen I got really excited... strange to see her and hear her being so un-Drusilla like though.
Only downfall of the DVD were it's special features which consisted of trailers for a bunch of movies I've never heard of and a documentary titled 'Toolbox Murders- the next cult classic?' or something like that, which basically showed everyone involved with the movie saying how it was expected to be such a hit and go down as the best horror movie since Tobe's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. No, just no. It was good and all, but not *that* good- besides, it was released ages ago and I really haven't heard anything about it since.
Alrighty, well I'm off to finish off the DVDs and prepare myself for a big night of tv... so many shows, so little time!"

"event","Work. Urgh. Today reminded me just how much I've missed the creepy customers and the grumpy customers and the smelly customers and the high customers and the customers who you want to suffocate with the plastic bags they keep demanding. If nothing else my day could be described as... colourful. When I first arrived I immediatley became Miss. Cranky Pants since I realised I had come back just in time for the repricing of our back to school stock- not only did I have to sort everything and price everything and recheck prices of everything and display everything when it all came in, but yay for me! I also get to re-sort it all, re-price it all and re-shelve it all now that it's all over! Joy! But thankfully my grumpiness was slightly alleviated by stoned!guy who came in giggling like a schoolgirl, bought a bottle of juice and proceded to discuss appropriate storage for bottled drinks. Apparently the most appropriate 'cool, dry place' is hanging off a palm or coconut tree. Also I should remember to 'just shout 'no!'' when I see a sign that says 'discount cigarettes' like the one that hangs behind the counter. Thanks stoned!guy, valuable life lessons learnt today: two. Three if you add 'never wander around the shops drunk or drugged up' to that list.
So that gave me a good giggle and cheered me up reasonably for the rest of the day. Other fun customers today included mumble!guy who seemed to be repeating sexsexsex under his breath the whole time he was in the store, and this poor woman who looked and smelt like she hadn't seen the inside of a bathroom to shower or use the toilet in god knows how long... the stench was just indescribeable, I had to go wash my hands straight after touching her money :S
In other work related news we have two new early-morning employees, one who creeps me out no end. He's a regular customer who I've always thought was nice until I heard some gossip about his freaky extra-curricular activitites such as stalking ex-girlfriends and crashing teenager-filled parties....so now every time I look at him I can't help but be wierded out.
And.. thats about it. So in summary: although customers who are amusing and brighten your day do come in, they are few and far between. For the most part work is all about dealing with annoying customers who may or may not bother with personal hygiene, as well as being in the close vicinity of possible-axe-murdering coworkers. To conclude: work sucks."

"event","Alrighty, my late-ish new years resolution: must use lj more often! Especially since I shelled out an entire five bucks so I can have a journal prettified with a cool mood theme.
So here I am, making an entry....
So today I went into the city with my parents for lunch and a bit of a look around. We ate at some fancy harbour-view restaraunt, right near the... Hyatt, or something... some fancy hotel anyway, which Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart just happened to be staying at. Spent most of the 2hr lunch watching the doors and the top floor for any signs of them, but no such luck.
The food was incredibly average...and it didn't help that it was mostly seafood. Mum and dad both had seafood platter entrees and lobster main meals, which looked pretty if nothing else... me, I wanted the grilled chicken, minus a lot of fancy stuff that came with it like red peppers and olives, but was told they couldnt be removed since they were in some kind of sauce thing.. so I ended up just having plain grilled chicken and chips, which was as boring as it sounds. Their desserts were also mediocre, and, like everything else, ridiculously overpriced...
After lunch we did a bit of walking up and down the water front, where we also didn't see anyone famous. Mum forced us into looking at the MCA (Museum of Contemporary Arts) which we fondly renamed the MCC (Museum of Contemporary CRAP). These morons actually think that they can bolt a white, hollow cylinder to the floor, stick a ball in it and call it art. Man, the crap that was in that place was astounding! Lucky they didn't charge an entrance fee or we wouldn't have been happy campers.
After the MCC there was more walking over to the Opera House, yet more walking through the Botanic Gardens and then finally a bit more walking to the station. Home sweet home! I haven't seen that much sun and done that much activity in a good long while... I was actually feeling pretty good about it all until I realised just how sunburnt I got :( Ouch. 
Oh well, gives me a good excuse to hide out indoors with all the movies I've hired :)"

"event","So I've managed to go an entire week without being assaulted with pointy weapons of any kind, and I'm feeling pretty good, if not a little bored. In fact I was so bored that today at work I ended up taking out every single item in our huge drink fridge and scrubbing the thing spotless. Cleaning. Me cleaning. Thats like the first sign of the apocalypse or something.
So in celebration of all this boredom, this afternoon will be one of quizzes, ebaying and movie-ing.

First up, this survey thingy I'm shamelessly stealing off Sarah:

* Four jobs you have had in your life:
  shop assistant, assistant caterer person thingy, netball coach and
  netball umpire

* Four movies you would watch over and over:
  for richer or poorer, fright night 2, dawn of the dead and bride of chucky 

* Four places you have lived:
  umm..my old house in this exact location, a unit up the street while the new
  house was getting built, the new house and uh, my mums womb?

* Four TV shows you love to watch:
  buffy, the nanny, saturday night live, angel

* Four places you have been on vacation
  america (disneyland, woohoo!), vanuatu, new caledonia, norfolk island

* Four websites I visit daily:
  ebay!, whedon.info, friends page of my lj, customers suck!  

* Four of my favourite foods:
  double cheeseburgers, freddo frogs, cheese and tomato sandwiches, 
  chocolate swirl cheesecake  

* Four places I would rather be right now:
  im quite happy right here, thankyouverymuchly... although i could handle 
  being asleep in bed, on the lounge watching tv, on the set of a cool tv 
  show or... sleeping anywhere, actually"

"event","Wow. Today has been the most unproductive day in the history of man. I've been 'cleaning' since about 10 this morning, and so far I've succeeded in: painting my nails, writing out a list of movies i need to see sometime in the near future, writing out meaningless events in my 2006 diary (mostly consisting of 'working', 'work @ 5:30' and 'working all damn day')and putting some new songs on my ipod. Oh, and I also moved a stack of papers from the computer desk over onto the ginormous pile on the other desk. 
Other highlights of the day involve watching the final episode of Firefly, *sob*, and trying to eat as many twizzlers as possible just to get rid of the damn things. Although I'm really not hungry at all... could have something to do with all the food I consumed last night at the pre-opening party for Narelle's Subway/Squeeze store. First time I've had Subway before, and while I wasn't too impressed, the food was deliciously free- so naturally we were all eating as much as humanly possible. I had one of the big subs with some type of chicken and salad, a raspberry freeze, a pine-watermelon freeze, some chocolatey drink that i had to throw half of away, a passionfruit gelato and two yummy ferrero rocher gelatos. Just thinking about it makes me full all over again. 
Cue heavy thoughts: I'm happy for Narelle and all, love her to death, but I don't think I want to be eating Subway for all.. or even *any* of my lunch breaks...I feel kinda obligated to support her store, so now I'm going to feel crappy everytime I walk past the place with my standard cheese and tomato sandwhich from the deli... hmmm."

"event","So this years Christmas was actually *fun*, despite the wierdness of going out and having someone else prepare the food. Woke up at about 6ish, which was actually a sleep-in considering it was christmas day, and the family exchanged presents. Mum liked the vase I got her, dad pointed out that the lotto giftpacks I've been putting together at work actually have the pricing information nicely on display for the recipient, and I got new pj's, chocolates, various other knick-knackey thingies and sweet, sweet money. We all forewent (is that a word?) breakfast, and instead watched Elf, which is the cutest movie ever, and led to my getting a billion christmas carols stuck in my head. At 11 we went over to my aunty's house and exchanged presents with her and my granparents- yet more money and more chocolate :D ooh, and a nice little earing holder doo-dad. Straight after presents we left for the club, and the whole while I couldn't stop feeling guilty about the poor people that had to work, and kept thinking we'd be the only idiots doing something like this on christmas day- but when we got there there were heaps of people milling around, and when we went upstairs to the function room thingy the place was *huge*. So many people were there, I was amazed.. also amazing was the fact that most of them were actually normal. There were a few single, lonely looking people, but they were seated with smaller groups, so everyone had someone to talk to. Food was on a little after 12, but was incredibly disorganised- there were two really long tables set up for the buffet, and instead of doing it by tables the guy just said 'enjoy' and woosh- everyone was up and racing for the plates. Dad and I waited for a good 20 minutes before joining the queue. The food was...fairly average. Standard christmas fare- salads, cold meat, ham, turkey, seafood, vegetables..the turkey was really good, but the rest was ho-hum. Deserts were incredibly yummy though- eclairs, profiterols, mini-pavlovas, mud cake, fruit tarts, fresh fruit.. and there were no servers patrolling that area, so I definitley got my moneys worth on that table alone :)
There was also great entertainment, which we weren't expecting. What started out as a band doing great covers turned into a really funny stage act with costumes and parodies and bare-assed bagpipe players- sounds totally lame, but it was really quite amusing. Also amusing were the old, rythym-lacking people who got up to dance. And the family of total sluts that were sitting the next table over from us. Not to be hypocritical, but the mother had the fakest boobs I've ever seen, her chin was practically resting on them. The father had that over-the-hill bleached blonde hair-dark glasses-pierced ear kinda thing happening. And the daughters. Dear god, I've never seen anything so sad. All three had really obvious hair extensions, and the clothes- dear god! One of them was wearing this leopard print... thing. Everytime she walked passed (kinda stumbling in her ridiculously high shoes) she flashed her ass it was that short, and it was a fat ass too, so that was kinda traumatising...
So yes.. after laughing our asses off at the entertainment, intentional and not, we parted with my aunty and grandparents, and went to visit my dads family. That was kinda boring, but we were only there for a short time, so it didn't matter too much. I'll never understand uncle Steve.. he is just so not priest-like. He swears, loves horror movies, and loved the Marilyn Manson shirt we wrapped up for me to pretend I had bought with their christmas money. Also amusing was my grandma, who is a manipulative bitch that no-one likes. Every christmas she brings up this bottle of hand lotion that was a present of hers that went missing one christmas. We all assume that bigpa through it away with the wrapping paper, but she loves to accuse my mum of going home with it. Absolutely hilarious. This year, mum let her have it, started unpacking our bags of presents and throwing wrapping paper around to show we hadnt picked up anything that wasnt ours. Ahh, the inevitable drama of family gatherings. Thankfully, this side of the family is so wierd that two seconds later we were moving on to something else entirely.. but thats when I got bored and tuned out.. 
After that it was home, home on the range... just in time for National Lampoons Christmas Vacation :) Then I was so damn tired I went to bed to semi-watch, semi-sleep through that Bruce Willis movie that was on... I had just dozed off when the people across the river started their fireworks display. They always put on a really pretty show on christmas and new years, and this year it went on forever... but was still fun to watch. So back to sleep I go, only to be woken by more fireworks at 9:30... then more at 9:45... then again at 10 (which scared the shit out of me they were so loud). As predicted, more fireworks at 10:15, which kept going and going and going, and then- the sweet sound of police sirens, and no more fireworks :D
And that was christmas. It was fun. I can't believe its over already!
Anyhoo, I've got couple of measly photos to post: (and sorry! i cant get a cut to work!!)

I got up early and decided to actually be dressed for the day, since I was expecting my Hellraiser DVDs to be delivered, and didn't want to look like some hobo squatting in the house. After I looked semi-presentable I checked the door in case they had come while I was in the shower, but nope, nothing. Then I walked into the computer room, turned on the computer and checked my emails (also, nothing). Then I walked passed the door again and there was this gigantic stack of parcels just waiting to be unwrapped :D All for me! I squealed like a little girl and then proceeded to tear into the packaging: first up, my beautiful, beautiful DVDs, all shiny and new. Next- my Marilyn Manson t-shirts. They don't look near as dodgy as I thought they would :) I tried them both on, and even though they're both the same size, one seems so much larger than the other, so I've sent an email to the seller to see whats the what.. this is probably gonna cost me a lot in postage, so maybe I'll just leave that one as a wear-around-the-house thing... and then, at the bottom of the pile: books! Two shiny, freshly printed copies of Untouchable :D Yay! Today is gonna be the best day ever! I'm gonna read the first few bits of the book, while wearing one of my cool new shirts, then watch a couple Hellraisers, then go mini-golfing tonight for the work christmas party. Hoorah!
On a less fun note, after all the creepy bug talk yesterday, last night I went to get into bed, and flung the blanket off, releasing the mother of all flying cockroaches. I saw this balck thing kinda swoosh at the wall, but couldn't see anything more.. then I heard this gross crackling sound and saw this huge black thing scuttering all over the trading cards I have blu-tacked around my wardrobe. So naturally I screamed and jumped about and practically cried for my mummy :) Then I wrapped the blanket around me and huddled on the bed while mum came in and killed the thing :P It was quite amusing.. except mum didn't think so, since it was after midnight and I woke everyone up.
Urgh, cockroaches freak me out...."

That's the kind of stuff you joke about- I've seen so many movie icons with the text ""destined to star in gay porn"" and laughed my ass off [case in point here -->http://www.livejournal.com/community/horrorfilmicons/31417.html#cutid1] , I just can't believe it's actually happened.

"event","So today was meant to be a day of watching movies and eating popcorn and doing all that kinda crap with friends. Except one friend decided she needed to buy a duckling for her boyfriend for their some-inconsequential-month anniversary. Since me and Felicity had no desire to spend an hour in a tiny car to buy said duckling from a farm, we went ahead with our movie day as planned. Or not so planned. As expected my choice of movies wasn't up to standard, so instead we watched Speed 2- which omg, i never realised was so shitty. Why is it even called 'Speed 2'? It has absolutely nothing to do with the first one except for Sandra Bullock. And while it's not too busy being a total Titanic rip-off it's full of some of the worst acting and special effects I've seen in a while-and with the crap I've been watching lately, that's saying a hell of a lot. So after that disaster we were kind of bored, and started to watch one of my movies- Unleashed. I thought it was going splendidly, but apparently not because Felicity suggested we watch Oprah instead :( After Oprah, which I semi-slept through, we dropped Felicity home, and I returned to finishing the movie. It was actually very good, the fight scenes were just... *woah*. A little confusing at points though, when there were bits when it was getting a bit too sexy between this 30-something killing machine and this little chick with braces. 
After that I finally got around to watching House of Wax, and I'm really glad I did. It didn't try to be like the original at all- it basically just took the same concept of real people encased in wax combined with a deformed a psycho, and went a whole new route from there. The effects were awesome too- lots of miniatures and models instead of a tonne of CGI. And *yay* Paris Hilton got a big sharp pointy thing rammed right through her brain :D
My viewing was disrupted half way through though, since dad's stupid ebay TV arrived. I was so shocked that it actually came in one piece, but here it is. And I hate it. Stupid widescreen crap makes everything look short and fat. Hopefully dad will agree to put it downstairs and let us keep our nice, normal TV a bit longer.
Also news today: I hate Gloria Jeans Coffees. They owe me ten bucks and won't reply to my emails!"

"event","Well,it's official. George Romero may very well be the most overrated director in the history of film. Now, Dawn on the Dead is a masterpiece- don't get me wrong. But the thing is, we appreciate it because of how well it was put together for it's time. We can forgive the dodgy effects and craptastic plot line because we understand he didn't know any better in 1970-whatever. But there's just no excuse for the abomination that is Land of the Dead. It once again shows us that Romero's vocabulary extends little beyond the words 'flyboy' and 'spick', and his penchant for gut spilling scenes is obviously still intact, with half the zombie gore seemingly cut and pasted straight from his original movies. 
And tell me this: if hordes of your zombies can't break through paper-thin plywood, how is it that two of them can tear a human body in half?
If the zombies continue to decompose, why aren't their brains rotting and killing them? Some of them have been wandering around for 30-odd years!
If zombies eat all the people they come across, tearing them to bits and leaving nothing but bones, how come zombie numbers keep growing?
Why was there not more shirtless John Leguizamo!?
For crying out loud! Some people have waited 20 years for this movie! You'd think he'd have put a little more thought into it!
I wanted to like this movie, I really did, so I watched it a second time with the audio commentary, hoping to come to a new-found appreciation for it if nothing else. But it was like 2 hours of watching paint dry... and listening to some boring old geezer try to make it seem interesting and failing miserably. Romero broke up the long stretches of silence and wheezing with two fascinating key phrases: ""Now that wasn't in the theatrical version! Or was it? No, no... we had to shorten it for the theatres"" and ""That was some CGI there. Like the building. The building was put in later. The building looks great. It wasn't there. Really, it wasn't there- would you believe it!?"" Now while admitedly the building did look pretty spiffy, it was hardly worth the rental fee. Thank god I didn't buy the movie outright or I'd be pretty pissed.
In brighter news, I watched Wes Craven's Wishmaster after I was released from work early today (woohoo!I almost had an entire afternoon to myself!). Now there is a man that knows how to write and direct. Such a good movie, I think I may have found something to add to my so-far-non-existant christmas list :)
So yes, thats my little schpeel for the day. I still have a Buffy-craving that I need to satisfy, but there's just so much happening on tv tonight, I'll have to save it for tomorrow.. after work. I hate work."

Bought a top as well, because a shopping expedition just isn't a shopping expedition unless you come home with a trashy top you're never going to wear. Also got mum her christmas present, so that's one thing off my list. A while ago she broke a vase that was passed down to her from her grandma or something, and today I managed to find a similarly patterned one... now all I have to do is hide it from her, which will be tricky since she's such a big snoop.
Also today, I had a bit of trouble at Gloria Jeans. Went to buy an iced chocolate, gave the cashier chick a 20, and only got $6.05 change- $13.95 for a drink my ass!! Turns out she didn't remember me giving her a $20 note, so they had to take my name and number, and this afternoon they called to say that yeah, they were $10 over, and could I come back tomorrow to collect it. Pfft, like I'm gonna travel all the way back to Miranda to solve a problem they created. So hopefully they'll be able to mail me a money order or something...
And I was also on the lookout for a new mousepad. Simple enough, right? But no, not one single shop had them- except for BigW, who only had one crappy Robotz design. Also, all Felicity wanted were wooden salad servers- a fairly simple shopping item as well. We must have looked in every single department store, homewares store and supermarket and nadda! We finally found one set that was perfect, except they were charging something like $50- for a bloody spoon and forky thing! Ridiculous.
Boy my life is exciting! What else to report?.... I went to buy Dawn of the Dead on dvd, coz I can't wait till next week to buy the box set with Land, but they've somehow managed to go from about $20 to almost $40! Rip-off! Also, in keeping with the suckiness-of-dvds theme, I saw the one thing I've been trying to avoid. The entire Buffy collection set. Sure, it's ugly and compact, but all those special features! I'm tempted to sell all my old ones and get the new set, but I like the boxes way too much. Hopefully the video shop gets the set in, then I can at least see all those new and exciting things once..."

"event","Yesterday really got me into the christmas spirit. I spent an entire 7 hour shift at work putting up christmas decorations and moving all our christmas stock from where I had previously spent another 7 hour shift putting it. Now the shop looks really prettiful. Only problem is, I assume we are now going to start playing christmas carols, and- god help me- turn on our christmas bells. Every year these bells make me want to either stab a pencil through my ear, or attack all the customers with said pencil. They ring out christmas tunes all. fucking. day. Some days you can tune them out, but most of the time you're so busy being annoyed at them that you can't help but listen. And then every single customer has to remind you that they're there- 'My god, how do you put up with that all day?', 'Bet that gets annoying, huh?', 'Oh dear, I've been in here five minutes and *I'm* going crazy!'. And then there are the ones you want to strangle- 'My, aren't they lovely? Where did you get them?', 'Oh, how cheerful, I'd love to have them at home!'. No lady, you really wouldn't. Five minutes of their ringing and ringing and ringing and ringing and you'd be ready to bludgeon the next moron who made an ass-like comment like that. See? Can't you just feel the christmas cheer?
Also at work, we had our christmas present display, which included these reeeally life-like dog things. They sit in this little basket all curled up asleep, and they move like they're breathing. Every customer that looked at them had to do a double take to make sure they were fake. Then along comes this doofus of a lady. I didn't hear the start of the conversation, but she was talking to the boss, and my coworker came over to tell me to listen in. This idiot was patting the thing and talking about how lovely dogs are, and then asks my boss how much they cost. He tells her the price, 50 bucks or something, and she goes 'Really? My brother breeds collies and he sells his for over $300!' and then she leaves. As soon as she was out the door we all just broke down completely. My boss actually had tears of laughter in his eyes. Yeah lady, the newsagent is the first place I go to buy pets, too :P
So after all the shenanigans at work, continuing the christmas spirit mum and I went shopping. I knew what I wanted to buy Ben- I had seen it there last week, but of course, when I went to get it it was all sold out. But that was OK, coz I ended up finding something better... I hope. And then shopping for Sarah (you are so hard to shop for!!!!). Had something in mind, but I just couldn't find it anywhere, and then I realised it was totally lame, so I went back and bought her pretty much the same thing as Ben. 
Then, again in the christmas spirit, I bought myself an early christmas present- the Evil Dead game for Xbox :D Played it today for the first time and am incredibly impressed- its hilarious and bloody and interesting- everything a good game should be :) Plus, Bruce Campbell actually took the time to do the voice work, unlike some stuck up bitchy stars who shall remain nameless *coughSMGcough*.
And finally, still in the merry vein of christmas time, I spent the afternoon screaming at dad, who is determined to buy a new TV off ebay. ebay. yes, ebay. What a frickin moron! I can't seem to get him to understand that you don't buy big, expensive things there. You buy crappy DVDs and tshirts and trading cards certainly, but not televisions! Thankfully, he can't seem to figure out how to bid properly- he enters his bid once, then never goes back. He's bid on three sets, and luckily has been outbid seconds later without even knowing it :) Sometimes being technologically illiterate is a blessing.
Alrighty, I think I've rambled enough- back to killing things with my trusty boomstick..."

"event","*Yawn* *Yawn some more* I had the wierdest night last night. Went to sleep at about 10- the kind of sleep when you're out as soon as you hit the pillow. Then at exactly 1am I woke up to something that sounded like screaming across the bay. About 5 minutes later there were sirens and stuff, so that kind of freaked me out. Then I just couldn't get back to sleep. I ended up watching the end part of the 'Late Night Game Show' or some such crap, hosted by that guy from Big Brother. I even tried to ring up for some of them, but apparently you leave your details and they call you back, and I wasn't about to make my dad all cranky at that hour of the morning. After that, there was a small VH piece on Sarah McLaughlin, which kept me awake coz I was all 'ooh, singing chick from Buffy!'. Then there was a commercial that went for over an hour, disguised as an entertainment show or something. It was for 'Proactive' skin care, and they had about a dozen celebrities all plugging the product. It was kind of amusing to see Puff Daddy... P.Diddy... Puffy... Diddy... whatever, talk about his troubles with acne. Finally at about 3:30 I must have drifted off, because when I woke up again it was only 5am :) Luckily I somehow went straight back to sleep, and now here I am. Dead tired. Know I'm definitley not getting *anything* done today :S"

"event","Today was a day filled with reanimated corpses. It started off with me waking up from an incredibly real dream about travelling by boat to different battlefields and scary maze-like places where I had to kill armies of zombies. I woke up half expecting to find guns strapped to my body or something. Then I watched Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, and all the special features on both disks. I also realised for the first time that Romero in fact had nothing to do with the Dawn remake- which is a shame, since I always thought that that was his best work. Also? Shame on me for not knowing. Kinda makes me look forward less to Land of the Dead, since I assume it'll be back to slow-moving mofos and wierd ass explanations of solar radiation or what have you. 
After all the flesh eating fun I got yelled at for not doing the dishes, and then yelled at again for not tidying the house. And now, after making promises of doing household-y stuff tomorrow, I'm going to start in on Day of the Dead before House starts :)

All that's left is for the juniors to finish pricing a few more things and it will be over!! And they'll do it just in time to take all the credit for the entire job....
So today I'm taking a well earned rest. Mum has threatened me with bodily harm if I don't clean up the house, but yesterday I went out and hired Romero's 'Dead' collection... so I don't see myself leaving the lounge once I get stuck into that.
On with the movies then, I guess, since there's no uni results to obsess over yet..."

"event","So today was, as per usual, entirely uneventful. Heard back from the biochem scholarship people though- didn't get it, and can't say I'm too surprised- my poor passes and credits were apparently no match for the high-distinction averages of the uber-brained like... sometimes scrunchie-wearing/hankerchief-wearing/bald guy whose name I really can't remember.
So I guess that was something different. But then I went to work- which, you guessed it, was all about the towers of boxes. And rude customers. I kinda felt bad. This lady was being real snippy about using the photocopier- she couldn't get the darkness/lightness balance quite right, and basically demanded that we do it for her, and reimburse her the money for each page she copied wrong. Her exact words were 'I just can't waste my money on trying out all the settings', to which I automatically replied 'And we just can't waste our paper on you trying out all the settings'. And I said it really rudely too. I didn't mean to, it just came out! But she was really nice after that, I think I shocked the hell out of her by standing up for myself. So that was a new experience- usually no matter how assertive you are, customers will continue to be total dipshits.
My exciting day also involved the midday movie, which was like watching five different movies rolled into one: disfigured girl struggles to live in an oh-so-cruel world. She falls in love with a boy, who loves her despite her scars. He convinces her to rob her boss. Her boss catches her in the process and has a heart attack. She can't bring herself to let him die, so she hangs around and gets arrested. In jail she finds the love of her life has taken off with her money and her beautiful sister- she was being used. Sad face. In jail she gets beat up coz shes ugly. The doctor who treats her tells her about his revolutionary reconstructive surgery. Once out of jail, she gets the surgery for free. Doctor-man falls in love with her, and proposes. She says yes, only to find out the only reason he likes her is because she now looks like his dead wife. Using her new beauty and confidence she tries to get even with original creepy boyfriend, while at the same time falling in love with a man she used to work with who doesn't recognise her anymore. Drama, drama, drama.
I also watched Evil Dead 3, which was much better than I remembered.

Yet another entry about work. There were endless towers of boxes. There were customers. There were drunken people looking for directions. There were thieving assholes who seemed really nice at the time. There were also sucky delivery men who couldn't be bothered to carry the papers they delivered an extra two fucking metres so that I didn't have to dash out of the store in between customers to pick each of those 30 bundles of heavy papers up and move them so they sat against the wall, and not where people had to walk.
So today was an all round workout for my physical and mental state.
Luckily I got to come home, lay on the lounge and watch Tootsie."

Once again I had to face the mountains of boxes full of crap, and even though I worked solidly all damn day you wouldn't even know someone had been in there. And lucky me- I get to go back tomorrow! Thankfully I don't have too many hours next week, so whoever's there during the day will be left to suffer at the hands of our back to school stock, and hopefully it'll all be done by next Saturday :)
On top of all the chaos of back to school stuff, today was my bosses wedding. He was at work till 12, and boy was he stressed- and a stressed out boss equals an equal parts stressed and terrified staff. Not a good combination.
But I do hope all goes well for him this afternoon- it's meant to rain though, which is pretty sucky.
And look how interesting my day has been- a whole entry about work!
The only other thing to report is that I've rediscovered my love for Shakespeare, so this afternoon I'm going to finish watching Othello, and maybe even finish reading Hamlet... kinda makes me miss high school english... but not really.
So I bid thee good morrow, and doth wish we should merry meet once more... or.. something...."

Behold the prettiness :D  
This has been the most exciting thing I've seen all day. 
Went shopping with Bec, saw a lot of clothes- a whole lot of butt-ugly clothes. Everything in every shop looks the exact same, and while some of it's pretty, it's all made of the same cheap-ass material that looks like it'll fall apart after a couple of washes,  and they all have the same ridiculously over-priced price tags. My favourite sighting today was a sign saying ""bargain!"", below which were flimsy tank tops with a couple of beads sewn loosely on the front. The bargain price? $79.95! Wow!
I did end up buying two new tops, neither of which I think I'll actually wear... but they look real pretty :) And I bought I shiny new DVD rack. Which I had to cart home. In the heat. By myself. I expect to wake up with bulging biceps tomorrow morning for all that effort....
Hmm, what else? Oh! To top of my day of quality television yesterday I watched Harry and the Hendersons. Lord I love that movie! After all these years it still makes me laugh and cry so hard. It was funny too, watching all the commercials from aaaaages ago- the clothes! the commentary! oh the laughs!
Ahem. I really need something to occupy myself with. Maybe I'll take up knitting or something.."

I was so bored I ended up watching the Jerry Springer Musical, which yes, is as awful as it sounds. Two hours listening to songs like ""I want to shit my fucking pants"" and ""Fucked up the ass with barbed wire"" sung by men in diapers and drag. No, I kid you not. Quality material. And the stupid guy playing Jerry didn't even remotley look or sound like him. But at least that filled up a bit of the day.
What else did I do... I made pancakes, and put chopped up Boost bars in the batter. Note to self- never do that again, it made me want to hurl.
Ooh, and I succesfully connected my ipod to the new computer without losing any songs. Exciting, I know.
So now here I am. Nothing to do. Nothing to watch. I might be forced to use the treadmill to occupy myself."

There were four questions- 2 essays which were really involved and not expected, and 2 practical questions which required about 20 minutes of reading each. I managed to do the essays reasonably well (I hope) but lordy lord, those last two were awful. We were taught to write press releases that were one page max. This one required 15 paragraphs, which was about 3 pages. And the letter to the editor we had to write- sounds simple enough, but we were told our client was a innvoations business somethingorother and we had to respond to an article about some type of business trend... didnt understand a word of it.. the only thing i managed to understand was that apparently business people need to be young to be innovative, so I managed to write about 5 of the required 10 paragraphs about how you can teach old dogs new tricks or something bullshitty along those lines... then it was pens down. I hope at least some of it made sense.
So hooray! No more learning for the next few months!"

so there was that suckage, and then, on the way home i had to deal with this shitty old lady. as per usual everyone was squished into any gaps they could find, and luckily i got a seat facing away from the sun so i didnt have to make squinty faces the entire ride like the people opposite me. then one of them gets off and this grumpy looking wrinkly woman sat in her spot, which was shady since we were stopped at a station with shelter. as soon as we leave the station she gets a facefull of sun and immediatley snaps at me 'you should be sitting here, swap seats with me now'. no joke- just like that. no 'oh im sorry dear, the sun is agitating my fragile old-persons eyes, would you perhaps mind if we traded seats?'. she just flat out demanded that i move. i was in so much shock that someone would be that rude, i just kind of sat there making like a fish, but the nice little wrinkly lady next to me told me not to worry then pointed at the old hag and said 'your bottoms on a seat isnt it? stop your complaining' :P *hugs* thankyou cute little grandma! but honestly, who does that!? mean old people make me grumpy. stupid timetable changes make me grumpy."

"event",":D Just got back from Melbourne and boy did I have a cool week! Spike!Giles!David Fury! The convention was soooo good... well, the meeting and listening to the guests was soooo good, but the majority of the day was spent waiting in line after line after line, which was less good- but the hotness of James Masters and the coolness of Anthony and David more than made up for it :D
We started the Saturday off with Q&A with David, who is the funniest guy ever... in fact it was so fantastic to be in the same room as him that I've pretty much forgotten what he actually was talking about... just general Buffy stuff I guess. He talked about Lost and I kind of got the impression that he doesnt like the show, or JJ, that much... he was saying how the writers don't get the kind of respect he was used to on Buffy and that the directors pretty much have free reign... and that JJ has no idea what the whole thing is going to turn out to be... ooh, and there was this funny group of girls that got up and asked how ""boy vampires get excited when they have no circulation"" :P Poor David.. he stumbled through his response about how a vampires body has this 'human memory' that allows them to perform human functions like breathing and... yeah :D So after David had his little talk the organsisers announced it was time for photos with James and to buy tickets for photos with the other guests, plus to pay for autographs (sheesh, these people must have made an absolute fortune!!!). Unlike last year they werent doing things buy row number (which sucked, coz I was right near the front)... so instead we all got in this huuuge line. I wasnt even half way through it when they announced it was the last opportunity for a photo with James.. luckily they let us buy our ticket from this guy walking up and down the place... and im babbling. So anyhoo, got my ticket, went and got my picture taken- yet again all I could manage was a dorky smile and a stuttered 'hi, how are you'... but god that man has the nicest eyes *sigh*.... so after the photo I went back and joined the massive line yet again...this time I managed to buy everything I needed. Then it was time for Q&A with James. He didnt cry this year, which was nice... all the questions were pretty light.. except for one guy who got up and asked all three guests some stupid, complex question about hidden meaning or the existence of god or some such crap... what made him even more of an idiot was that James was all ""you guys can be as randy as you like, ask me any horny questions"" and Dork!guy was all ""you said we can ask anythign right?you give us free range, right?"" and here we are all thinking it was going to be something juicy, and instead he starts talking about how joss is an aethiest so why can one find so much religious imagery blah, blah, blah, who gives a damn! But funny Erection!girls got up and asked their question again. James's answer was rigor mortis :P So yeah... what else did he talk about, umm...just random stuff from what I remember.. falling through set walls, getting laughed at when he had to go around naked and SMG was fully clothed and in ear muffs.... I'm sure he talked about more stuff, but again my mind is still hazy getting over all the excitement :D
So after James, we all went out and yet again got in a frickin queue! Luckily I was near the front and got my picture taken with David Fury who was so sweet... he made sure to note everyones names and everything *awwww* After that pic, I got in yet another fucking line.. this time to get my autograph from Anthony. Not even half way through the line and they announce Anthony is leaving for photos, so anyone just wanting his autograph could go to the front... So off I went, and I got to meet Giles!!! He's actually kind of wierd.... big with the putting on strange voices and stuff... I did manage to not only grin like a fool and ask him how he was, but I also asked him about how he was liking Australia...and then I said something lame ass like ""you rock"" which made him give me a funny look *blushes furiously* :P By the time I had gotten into the signing room David was in there too, so I just kind of snuck across and got him to sign a lame ass script photocopy thing (quality merchandise they had going there :P)... again, he was so sweet.. I talked to him for like 5 minutes (which is also kind of sad, cos no one else seemed to want me to move so they could get his autograph :()So yeah, we talked about his time in Australia, and Sydney cos he had just been there... and how he was too scared to climb the Harbour Bridge, and how I was scared when I climbed the Harbour Bridge... and about how much the episode ""Helpless"" rocks (no funny looks this time, thank you very much!) And yeah... did I mention how cool he is? 
God this is a long story.....
So, after that there was an auction in the main hall place....lots of crap that you could buy on ebay for a fraction of the cost. I wonder if the people who bought stuff actually knew that. Like 200 bucks for a replica stake you can buy for $80....
And then it was time for Q&A with Anthony, who is much more likeable when you're not one on one. Apparently the people asking questions were all ducking down when they approached the microphone, so he started kneeling and bowing to everyone that came up which was hilarious...and yeah... he talked about... stuff... funny thing, he's so un-Giles-like in real life. Big with the swearing... Erection!girls asked their question again... I think his answer was just that vampires are mystical creatures or something along those lines.. Oh, he did talk about fanfic though, and about his first experience at reading Giles/Willow stuff :P and oh, his face when someone told him about Spiles and Giles/Oz fiction :D quite amusing.
And after that it was time to go home :( Luckily home was in the same buliding coz I was dead tired after all the excitement...
Ooh, and the next day I went back and bought some Buffy playing cards, and a box of Spike trading cards... yes I am a big ass nerd, but I'm a big ass nerd who now has a tiny circle of Spikes leather coat and a Juliet Landau autographed card :D Ooh, and the day after that me and mum saw Anthony getting out of a taxi... he kinda looked warily at us like we were gonna jump him or something so we didnt actually say anything to him.. 
And yes, that was the Buffy convention. I also went shopping and to zoos and museums and stuff, but I just cant be bothered to type anymore..."

"event","Yay! After a good couple of years waiting today I finally got to see Seed of Chucky :D Overall I was quite impressed, it was hilarious and gory and made me cry and everything.. I loved the whole Glen/Glenda homage... only thing that is gonna bug me forever is that for 20 frickin years all Chucky wanted to do was get the hell out of the doll, and when he finally got the opportunity he was all 'no thanks, i'm good'. Argh, that sucks. I blame Tiffany. Hopefully that'll all be rectified in the next movie *yay, more Chucky!!*
It's really quite sad, but watching that movie is the most interesting thing thats happened all week...  i finished all my assignments- i never want to hear that radio program ever again! and now it's time to get with the book learning- i cant believe im gonna be sitting exams in a couple of weeks... i feel a panick attack coming on..."

"event","So here I am, studiously avoiding doing any work and I come across this Sarah Michelle Gellar article. I'd alwyas seen the first part of this quote used in magazines and once on tv, but after reading the whole thing I see the error of my ways- I based a lot of my severe dislike for her on what I thought was her insistence that Buffy and Angel were meant for each other- turns out, she wasnt speaking entire crazy talk:

""There's a part of me that will always believe that Angel is Buffy's true love. That there will be a piece of her heart that will always be with him for the rest of her life. It doesn't mean that's the person that she's meant to be with eternally. The thing about Buffy and Spike is they understand each other on a level that nobody else understands her. They've both lived a hundred lives and I think there's a connection there that we will see evolve over the next couple of years where she realizes that he really is someone that she can trust, someone that's a companion to her and someone that really understands her unlike anybody else.""

Hmm, that lifts almost half of my hate... if only she didnt say some of the other stupid things she's said about her time on Buffy...

Oh well, maybe now I'll take a stab at doing some actual work.."

"event","Urgh, today was the biggest waste of a day ever. Stupid me! I set my alarm and got up nice and early, watched an episode of Alias, then spent about 2hrs getting ready and eating breakfast etc... Then I quickly got my molecular bio lab book in check and left to go to uni... trains were running on time for once, and even though there was torrential rain I managed to arrive at uni at a quarter to. Unfortunatley I was there at a quarter to 2, not a quarter to 1 when the lab started. Not a happy chappy!!! So I saw the lab demonstrator and we both agreed it would be best if I instead went to next weeks session. Argh! Not getting those 3 hours back... So yes, that was my day. Stupid rain. Stupid uni. Stupid non-ability to read a damn timetable!!!"

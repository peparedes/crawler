okay so tonight was the most exciting night of my whole life. I love Olta and Cory and Megan and Jordan and Kelsie to death. 

tonight we all went to the lake by kelsies house and argued for about 10 minutes about going skinny dipping. then we all went in and were like oh well lets go to the water trampoline. good idea ;) 

so cory jordan and kelsie went out there while me olta and megan stayed by the slide. then here come someone down the hill.... getting closer... into the light... KELSIES MOM! holy shit. 

me megan and olta hid behind the slide. cory kelsie and jordan jumped in the water. we got dressed, jordan left, cory went to jordans and me and olta are at oltas house. kelsie's grounded for like 3 months and megan has to stay there the rest of the week :/

im soo sorry kelsie. we didnt mean for you to get in trouble. im sorry also cuz that was the most fun ive had in a long ass time.

I havent seen Ryan in a long ass time and its makin me a little upset. He got 14 stitches in his foot so he cant do much of anything. So he probably forgot about my birthday too. Just like my family..."

Yesterday we had a game against Harrison, we lost 4-0 that was probly my least favorite game of my whole life. The game wasnt worth anything though so Im over it lol. We dont have soccer again until Monday which is a HUGE relief! 

I dont like school very much. I hate my 6th hour and my 2nd hour. My 3rd hour is my least favorite subject and 4th hour stresses me out. Our preject in science(4th hour) is due next week and we are presenting. I just dont like school very much. Tomorrow is senior skip day. I asked my mom if I could skip lol she said ""your not a senior only Peter is staying home"" 

So I have nothing else to talk about really. I get to be the photographer for my brother and Megan before Prom tomorrow and I have bowling too so it should be a good day.

Today is a snowday... and I did not get more than 3 hours of sleep all together last night. My mom is mad because I was up till 10*30 talking to my dad about my 4 year plan. He is in fucking Virginia and is the only person who can help me. I mean I know my mom wants to help, well actually maybe not, but she knows nothing NOTHING about the courses that I was to study in. All she would say to me is ""take spanish or gym"" cuz thats all she knows. So I told her that I was going to Ryan's so that his mom could help me out and she was like ""w.e i can help you why dont you ask his mom doesnt even know you"" blah blah freaking blah. I swear I was so fucking temped to say, ""well neither do you so whats the difference"" So I told my dad about going to Ryan's and he said that it was probably a good idea since my mom is uncapable of helping me make decisions of any kind.

I honestly wish that my mom could accept the fact that I will not get into a university and I will never be as smart as Peter or Eddie and that I will not ever make her proud of me. No matter what I do there is always something wrong with it. My dad can accept the fact that im not the smartest person around, all my friends accept it and my brothers accept it so why cant she!? Ahh I am so aggravated. Im gonna try and sleep. Have a nice snow day.

Sorry about all this loser complaining again. Im just mad and this is the only way that I can actually let it all out lol.

  just to have it for myself now i dont know what to do

7.i couldnt tell you why she felt that way she felt it everyday 
  and i couldnt help her i just watched her make the same mistakes again 
  whats wrong whats wrong now too many too many problems dont know where she belongs

xxx8.i tried to be perfect but nothing was worth it i dont believe it makes me real 
  i though itd be easy but no one beloieves me i meant all the things 
  i said if you believe its in my soul id say all the words that i know just 
  to see if it would show that im tryin to let you know that im better off on my own

xxx9.open your eyes look up to the skies and see 
  im just a poor boy i need no sympathy because im 
  easy come easy go little high little low anyway the wind blows 
  dosnt really matter to me.. to me

10.well then we got to the place on a high speed chase 
  there was a girly in the corner with a plastic and then 
  she disapeared without a trace i said without a trace

11.if i cut off your arms cut off your legs would you still love me 
  anyways why dont you love me anyway if i cut off your legs cut off your legs would you still love

xxx14.youve got your ball youve got your chain tied 
  to me tight tight tight me up again whos got the claws in 
  you my friend into your heart heart beat again

  spring is like on jupiter and mars in other words hold my 
  hand in other words baby kiss me fill my heart with song 
  and let me sing for evermore you are all i long for all i worship and adore

I havent been up to a lot lately since i quit the basketball team... I just bowl now lol. We have a tournment on Saturday at Century Bowl at 7am! Ugh this better be a good tournment or im gonna be pissed. Megan was is a bad mood today lol. Cat and Katy always like... act different when people are there watching... like guys to be honest. The always like try and show off and what not. They left like 40 minutes before bractice ended too so that made us all mad. Katy's the captain and she shouldnt leave whenever she doesnt feel like bowling anymore. It's so dumb. 

HAHA I got an outfit yesterday from AE for shure! I wore it today lol. I got a white long sleeve shirt and I got a Red vest and then I got some black pants! It was so cool lol I was so excited to wear it. Of course I had no awesome shoes to wear with it lol. 

So I went to my new classes today! I have Math 1 now and I like it. I sat by Jake Seymore today. He's a pretty cool kid. Nick Scott sat behind me though :/ Chelsea is in my class too...

Yeah this week is gonna blow...majorly. I have to pass 2 out of 6 mid terms... or else i may not get credit for freshman year. A little upset about that. I have a band ""playing test"" tomorrow and I havent played anything for it and I also have math tomorrow... I have math. I think I am one of the dumbest freshman ever. I hate school :/

So on Saturday we did really good at our bowling tournment... I bowled a 172,165, and a 157. Everyone else bowled AWESOME!! It was so much fun. Then on Sunday we murdered Kettering for shure!! HaHa lol I got one point for my matches i bowled a 185 and a 162 (lost the 162 game). It was also a lot of fun. Then today at practice I bowling like a 106 lol it was really funny. I got the 5 7 split though it was so awesome.

Tomorrow I have to go to work for my brother from 3-5... then Ryan Bollman is coming to get me and he is going to take me to the Kettering game. I will be at the JV and possibly thr Varsity. I am going to see Brad Dorr lol. For shure. I miss all the people that go to Kettering. Man it would be so much better for me at Mott if a selected few went there. Oh well. 

I have to go take a shower and what not. I just got home from gay ass basketball. I hate our coach hes a deuche. Oh well

"event","""now i remembered why i stopped talking to you"" again with the #1 conversation ender...

Go ahead leave an anonoymous comment... go ahead cuss me out.. and go ahead walk right on out of my lonely pathetic selfish life Ryan Trevino. Just like you did last year. Im sorry im not good enough for you. Im sorry I dont set high enough standards for myself. And im sorry that I cant bring myself to apologize AGAIN just for one person. If you dont like who I am now... then you dont have to. I know you dont anyways. Im glad weve always gotten along so well. Im also glad that when you and me get in a tiny fight... you ALWAYS no matter what, ignore me. ALWAYS! Im happy that you have such good friend who talk behind your back and call you gay. And you only blame one person. Like me hah what a crock. Someone sayd something and I agreed like a few selected others on your little list. Its no wonder were mad at you. You dont pay attention to emotion. You say what you want and then leave. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH OH MY FUCKING GOD I FUCKING HATE WHEN YOU JUST GO ON A FUCKING AWAY MESSAGE ALL THE FUCKING GOD DAMN TIME ALWAYS I WISH I COULD JUST YELL AT SOMEONE OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD JUST LISTEN TO ME. GODDDDDDD I FUCKING HATE HOW YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS SOMETHING TO SAY. I FUCKING HATE HOW YOU THINK YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS TO GO DO SOMETHING ELSE. I FUCKING HATE TALKING TO SOMEONE WHO IS MORE USELESS THAT A BIG PILE OF HORSE SHIT ON A FUCKING FARM. I HATE TALK TO SOMEONE WHO DOESNT THINK THAT BEING FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE YOUVE KNOWN FOR OVER A YEAR IS LESS IMPORTANT... THAN SOMETHING YOU WONT EVEN FUCKING TELL ME. 

School sucks. Mid-Term cramming blows. Being in the ""fast moving"" math class was a waste of my very little ability. So basicly I got placed in some good classes for average people so I could get a fuckin D- through the whole semester... to not pass freshman math class... to lose credit... and look forward to some wonderul fucking summer school. I hate school. I have stress. I really really needed to vent. Thank you. Oh and thank you to Jeff Kitchen and Justin Fralick who rode home with me today and listened to me complain. I appreciate it. Thank you Jessika for always talking to me when I go insane, and knowing how I feel all the time in every mood swing i have. Thank you Kelsey Meyer for walking and talking with me about something I actually want to waste my life on. Thank you to everyone who puts up with my shit all the time.

So today... I had to wake up at like 7:15 so I could get ready for bball at 8. Who schedule practice at 8am on our break? Obviously our gay coach. I hate him. We got to meet our assistant coach today though. He is so cool lol. He laughs all the time. Unlike Gruca.

I am going bowling at 5 with Ryan Bollman though lol that should be kinda fun I guess. Yeah it will lol.

Yeah so today was quite boring and tomorrow will probably be te same way. I dont have much to write so that was it...

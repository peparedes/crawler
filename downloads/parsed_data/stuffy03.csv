"event","over the past two years i've kept this livejournal as a place to keep my thoughts in line, though slightly out of order.  and sometimes misdirected.  but the time is near (here actually) and i'm done posting myself, though vaguely, on the internet.  like leah, i find writing to be much easier and private with a pen and paper.  

looking back at some old replies to entries, good friends and good times.  there was the occassional anonymous reply, which i still don't like.  and i realize that at times i was fairly crude towards myself and specific others.  i was angry on those occassions, but i apologize for any damage done.  not that it helps to fix anything, but i thought i'd throw that out there since i read some old stuff and felt pretty bad about it.  not a glorious moment.  

anyhow.  (handshake and a wave)  i'm out.

today i went to church, played percussion, it was ok.  john's sermon though.  some of it i grabbed, but a lot of it just sounded like law.  and i definitely don't need to be taught that, i mean, Jesus died and replaced law with grace.  why go back?  retro-active crap never works anyway.  

then i went to leah's last symphony concert.  ""were you impressed?""  impressed?  i was flippin seduced.  so many poems could be written after tonight.  at intermission, i felt like i had just had sex.  only without the sex part.  it was like a heart sex.  music sex.  i swear i've never heard Music before today.  and today i even saw it, that's the only way to describe the piano player's hands, the choriographed bows and dancing hands.  they are music.  

i could go on and on and on about it and never reunderstand it for you.  and these unfortunate hands are not skilled enough to hold this relove for all to see.  

we ate at olive garden.  waited an hour and a half, didn't get my food for another hour it seemed because they fixed the wrong thing.  it was just bad too.  

i was shaking, the concert was so good.  i still feel it.  and as i try to express it, i feel it leaking out through unsubstantial words, so i'll stop.

"event","being in an enclosed room with stressed, tired, and somewhat giddy people can be an adventure, but for one of my scene partners, it was too much.  pretty much her dreams were securely stolen.  she's blaming a lot on herself, not fitting in, possibly transferring, and she's gonna have to get surgery for vocal nodes.  and she couldn't get a hold of her sister.

and i, in my finite experience, have become fairly aquainted with that feeling.  sometimes i wish i wasn't as sensitive to what others were feeling.  i could have my own self, not have to share myself with anyone, at least not my heart.  but it's like my heart just  hurts because they do, especially with memory.  vivid memory.  lucid even.

i'm done with the music video, i'm done with the paper, all that's left is a portfolio and a few exams.  and the year's over.  that means time to write more music and poems.  i still need to get those journals.  really badly.  writing in my honors folder just isn't cutting it anymore.

she feels like a failure.  ""but just keep trusting God, right?""  that's what she said.  i know she does, but i don't think she knows He can heal her.  more than that's going on too.  somethings you can just feel.  like when she won't look at you.

both scenes went well, inspite of crap like that.  really well.  people liked them.  and i kissed infront of about 60 people without freakin out or laughing.  still not sure if that's a good thing.

"event","i find that my writing style is digressing back to the old days before i really knew how to write.  maybe not the style, but just my wording.  less... creativity, just stating things.  i'm not really sure why, possibly because i haven't been reading much or writing as much.  just when i can.  have time to.  and not colapse.  which is rare.  

tomorrow's going to be long.  very long.  but i'll get through it cheerfully.  infact, i'll have fun with it.  eat that.

i need to buy three journals.  1) poetry journal.  2) character study journal.  3) spiritual journey journal.  and they need to look cool.  

i don't really like putting myself on hold.  especially for stuff i don't enjoi.

sometimes i feel more productive during a resting stage than during the busiest seasons in my collegiate career.  proportionally, i have done more, actually, i've done less.  but for some reason i like it much more if i sleep better.

i like the third floor guys.  playin frizbee and chillin everynowandagain is cool, but it's getting to the point where hanging out just isn't fun.  all i get are perverse jokes about christianity or cults.  or some sexual thing.  i try to play into it sometimes, but it starting to grate on my nerves.  nothing against them, it's just not an encouraging environment.  right now it all seems really negative.

while i was reading, my future dropped by to say hello again.  i still don't know at all what's going to happen, or even how to plan for it, or what angle to go at it, or what i want to do.  the same old same old.  but today it hurt with salt and rubbing alcohol.  i don't know myself well enough to know what i want to do.  i'm nowhere near getting a job or even an internship.  then that reminds me of dating and i think i'm really attracted to this girl but what can i do, i don't even have a job.  not to mention relationships definitely are not a strong point on my part.  it's just been rough emotionally today.

it's been a beat up on myself day.  if i wanted to be a rock star, wouldn't i want to practice more and write more and play more?  shouldn't i?  but that's changed somewhere, something went amiss.  a reason or a why must have been forgotten or rejected.  i just don't know what one or ones.  passion would be nice to have, i'm fairly passionate about writing though.  nothing seems very important.  i feel very third personish.  i dunno, tomorrow will be different.  that's how it rolls usually.

"event","woke up and slept through pretty much all my classes, except i decided not to in poetry because it rocks.  then took a nap before lunch.  then another nap before dinner.  i then decided around 8 after a convo that i should work out, so i went and walked.  and also decided to run.  i'm not an athletic person in the least, but i want to run for some reason.  i haven't been a runner, so i will be i guess.  hopefully this works out better than my attempt at violin. 

annie invited me to a convo she was speaking at about greek life and God.  and i honestly have a new respect for greek life.  is it for me?  still don't think so, and aside from that i don't really have time.  she read a children's story about an apprentice juggler who had a different inner beat.  a different rhythm to throw and catch to.  but this rhythm doesn't fit with the juggling squad, so he suppresses it.  to make a long story short, he has a solo and follows his natural rhythm and it turns out that he's a juggler clown spirit.  the best of jugglers.  his fear of losing his spot on the team was realized, but he acquired his most appropriate and right spot.  that's annie.  not juggling, but something like that.  that's me too.  she's a major tomboy.  i'm just different some how.  she never really had girl friends, but now she does through greek life, christian girl friends who really and deeply care about her.  they relate.  and it's a total blessing.

because of her testimony, i'll call it her testimony, i really began to think about greek life.  while it's a blessing for her in many many ways, for me it's like handing a saxophone to a drummer.  both are awesome instruments, just suited for different people.  so what do i do?  don't know.  find friends.  a close friend.  i've got some.  but a family?  it'd be nice.  probably critical, like annie said, even though many devo books say it, it's not a walk alone.

irony plays with me yet again, i believe in fellowship yet i have major qualms with a fellowship of brethren.  still not settling, but it's better.  plus, in honors i wrote a poem about being woken up horribly and i took two naps today.  i love it.

i was really discouraged for a while because i realized that i can't do a lot of things that i really want to.  i want to play guitar a ton better than i do.  i want to be the next e.e. cummings and revolutionize poetry somehow.  i want to be a fighter as well.  and a runner.  for the longest distances possible.  i kept coming up with tons and multitudes of things i want to do.  and time just doesn't allow for all of it.  time and college really don't allow for it.  but all i really thought i wanted was to be somebody else.  

i believe that i believe that i believe that i believe.  that's not reason enough.  no?  that's because it's not reason, it's experience.  but you shouldn't get caught up in the experience, ryan.  i've been over this before.  and aside from that, i mean i've seen people get healed, delivered, changed.  in conclusion, if you don't believe, i'll believe for you to believe.  

i'm not supposed to be superman or some moses or joshua or even jesus.  i'm gonna be super stuffy.  i'm myself.  people will see jesus in me because he's there.  no getting around that.  but God makes me me.  and because he makes me me, i'm decreased in his Glory.  the more i am made myself, the more evident God becomes.  

only you make you yourself and only yourself.  what?  no, i can't change anything about myself, behavior modification sure thing, but i can't change my heart.  God can.  i'm not my responsibility.  

but i realized that i wanted to be somebody else.  i wanted to do all these things because i wasn't happy with who i thought i was.  maybe i'm not meant to do some of those things, maybe i am.  but it doesn't matter because i'm not going to compare myself to anyone else again.  there are no favorites.  no one's more important than me and i no more than anyone else.  and i like it that way.  100 percent for every one.  as if God could give any less.  i still want to be really good at what i end up doing whenever i figure out whatever that is, but my standard no longer pertains to anything outside myself or higher.  standards are verticle i guess, not horizontal.  

i also found that when i acquire wisdom or some impartation or revelation, i need to act on it as soon as possible.  

through a series of conversations i went from having a home, to not really feeling at home, to not quite sure what home was, to displacing my home, to redefining my home, to nixing that idea of home, to having multiple homes, to understanding my concept of home, to realizing that i am always home.

wednesday was just as good.  and i had a college group leader meeting.  i lead worship, but at the same time, i never really considered myself very integral to the group.  well, i am.  so through this thing i'm gonna learn how to work in authority and learn spirit stuff at the same time.  today was good as well.  two tests, but i'm still bubbling.  i'm diggin this whole joy thing.  i hung out with rachele tonight as well, we got tea and then she showed me a bunch of her paintings, finished and yet to be.  i am completely impressed by the talent in that girl.  we played chess too, i won, but i could have sworn she had me at one point.  we talked a lot, and conversation is good for me.  paul and i also inadvertantly wrote a country song which we shall finish and sell to some bigshot.

"event","overdubbed on friday, that was pretty cool.  well, sort of.  we got it done and it's not bad.  i just realized how not rockandroll my voice is and how much like a 2nd grader tooting a trumpet is comparable to my voice control.  artist expression?  i was lucky to simply express.  but then i went to aaron bass's suprise birthday party.  played mafia.  it was pretty rockin.

i've been writing a lot of poetry lately.  and tonight i needed to write and didn't know what to write, so i just started and it took me to confession, or apology.  only they'll never read it.  whoever happens to capture my scope of ideals in the moment usually never reads it.  good or bad?  doesn't matter.  i'm not writing for them.  

but then, i can fool myself into thinking it's not for me either.  then i'm just writing to the temporary vacuum left by a notated idea.  i guess it frees me to write like i should.  with no fear of judgement and no self-censoring.  although since it is me, it usually ends up a bit vague.  sooner or later i guess i'll even lose the fear of a vacuum's condemnation.  

focus is gone.  but i believe.  that's all i need right now.

i learned how to fold a dollar into a heart with a flower in the middle to hold a quarter.  so i gave it to annie on this special valentuesday because she actually talks and holds conversations with me in poetry class.  she said i was cute and that i needed to sleep more.  i agreed and went to take a nap.

yesterday viking and i made valentines to give to everyone.  it was a picture of him in his viking get up and a green jacket swinging wide to cut my head off with his axe.  i was wearing my red jacket.  and behind us is a huge heart that says ""have a killer valentines day.""  everybody loved them and i'm fairly sure we're gonna do it again on some random day just because.  it was so much fun.  and we took the picture and i photoshopped it all in 20 minutes before class.  it rocked.

recorded the starving eyes yesterday with some pembroke guys.  it sounds really really good, i really like the guys' styles too.  totally different from randomfrequency, but it was awesome.  got all the tracking done except vocals, which never happens.  so we're all freakin ecstatic.  some people came over and listened to it, they all liked it, or were just nice about not liking it, either way, it was encouraging.

why do you get married?  for love, because she completes you.  not for sex.  duh.  it's never about the sex, the sex is an extremely great part of love and marriage.  so marriage is the relationship and sex is an experience, a great experience.  Paul numerous times, and i think Jesus did too, relates the relationship between the church and God as a marriage.  the relationship between me and God is the important thing, but without the experience (i.e. sex in terms of marriage) the marriage is not nearly as fun, and that neglect of the gift of sex leads to tons of problems.  so it's not about the experience, but not to have a recurring/special one, is the relationship really a marriage then?  

i have to raise my experience to what i read, not lower the Bible to what i experience.

am i going after the experience?  yeah, the experience specifically given to me, written in the Bible.  i'm just as excited about experience as i am about getting to have sex when i'm married.

long conversation last night in the hall with 5 other christians, all different denominations and a muslim.  and it was all about spirituality and nobody got offended, which would have been really really easy.  i've written before that i had a feeling God was bringing all these people together for a reason, and i think it's starting to surface.  for some reason i'm really really cautious though, shopping for truth again i guess.  it's weird.

in philosophy classes and history classes, facts aren't really interpretted.  we all more or less gather around one idea, or around two conflicting ones.  but in the poetry class she encourages us to bring our own interpretation to the discussion and no one really thinks the same thing.  no one goes the same direction, 4 cardinal directions, somehow we managed to get 16.  so that hilights all the different personalities as well.  i noticed today a girl who is more stonefaced than mitch alton.  i haven't heard her talk yet.  then there's the wonderful humorous girl and guy, good laughs there.  never a dull moment.  then there's the serious chick, and the sort of mysterious guy that looks like he's really a poet.  then there's the poet that never talks but has facial expressions galore.  it's going to be interesting to see a group like this mold together and trust each other as we read our own poetry out loud.

my day consisted of food, fzero, starwars, and homework.  it was good.  and ping pong.  but i did flip out once today, but i kept it under raps fairly well.  i dunno, christina was joking around with kibbe and in doing so put her arms around me and i guess i wasn't expecting it so i flipped.  it was just weird and i don't know why that messed with me so much, but i lasted another 5 minutes before i went back upstairs and did homework.  i'm still sort of uneasy, i think it reminded me subconsciously or triggered a memory.  or those are the same thing.  either way, i flipped and i shouldn't have.

i had forgotten that poetry was a spiritual thing.  even the author of my poetry class book was writing about how she gets this spiritual high from it and how souls connect and stuff through language.  a lot of responsibility comes with that spiritual outlet.  plus other spiritual elements pertain to language, i mean, God created everything by speaking.  i create spiritual realities with my words.  that makes it prophetic.  speaking of prophetic poetry, thursday night i sat down and wrote a poem about losing someone.  i think it's pretty good, but to the point--saturday i read my poetry assignment and the poems we had to respond to were about losing someone.  a loved one specifically.  i actually giggled when i realized that.  georgio read it, said it was good.  i like how he responds and criticizes my works, it's not harsh, but it's still honest.  stuff like that keeps me pushing to get better.

my birthday was cool.  took a bunch of guys to outback.  viking wrote about the evening on his journal.  

i'm growing, i know it.  physically feeling a spiritual growth is also kind of flipped out.  it's good though.  i don't know where i'm headed yet, but leah had an interesting thought about that.  ""it's bad to drift without purpose, but you're drifting towards a purpose.""  

i need to watch what i write.  i have influence somehow.  and i think about stuff a lot.  but i spend probably just as much time not thinking of anything.  just listening.  wanting something to invade that empty space we all have resting either over our hearts or under our heads.  something to fill it.  to pouring over my eyes.  to wiping away the trails with neglected sleeves.  to bending forth revealing forgotten pain on the run.  to me.

"event","went to church this morning and people talked about what i was so mad about last night.  it never gets old when that happens.  lunch at steak&shake then on to the old school arcade.  that was fun.  got home, learned twenty-four by switchfoot, got bored, played that song in front of my church for the singsperation.  then i walked with leah and kyle for about an hour.  so now i'm here, typing and conversing over instant messenger services.  

i feel like anything i say or write is really dorky, unwitty, and unimaginative.  all at the same time.  and that just doesn't set well with me.  

i think this next song is going to be about control.  yeah, it's turning out ok so far, hopefully i can revamp it and make it much better.  sometime i want to write a song with not many words.  but still rocks.  

yeah, i don't know where to go."

"event","i spent another hour in my car tonight, just driving around town because i couldn't think of anything else to do.  where did i go?  walmart, i think an orphanage, a few dead end streets, and walmart again.  where i stayed for a good half an hour and wrote in my journal.  where i was undisturbed.  undistracted.  and quiet.  ups and downs, man.  that's just how it is and i heard once that the people that grow the most are the ones who are constantly in conflict or going through ups and downs.  so i'm maturing, wonderful, but i've never wanted somebody comfortable to lean on or sit back to back or in a hammock or even just in my car with me to talk with before.  never wanted them this badly before anyway.  however, if i go through this alone, just me and God, then i mature.  but if it's me and a friend, then it's just something me and friend went through.  i wish i knew what i was maturing towards.  some sort of goal.  that would be nice.

i don't know about the whole gana thing.  i want to, but i don't know if i'd be able to handle it.  nate seems to think i can, but goodness, that's huge.  i dunno, just pile things up until i fall over, the noise i make will be glorious.  

sleep."

"event","kyle and i got back from mom's in kentucky yesterday.  she's doing well, a little weak, but i'm thinking she'll recover back to the mom we used to know.  kyle and i saw mitch in lexington on the way back and mom is staying with mom until the 5th or so.  it was good, but i've got stuff i have to do here as well.  like finish songs, that would be nice.  kevin's new years eve party was last night, i didn't sleep a wink.  

the entire time i was at mom's during the drives, i was at a steady grade of good.  then i get to kevin's last night and it's a constant up and down.  it was weird.  tired not tired, crowded lonely, talkative not-talkative.  just wasn't cool, and i really couldn't tell you why i felt like that, sometimes it would change every 15 minutes.  but burnout3 is amazing, awes even.  and it's impossible to try to write music with more than two other people in the room.  it just doesn't work.  

i need a shower.  although i'm not sure if i'd be able to stand up for very long in one spot without falling over and tumbling out of the tub.  

i really want to write and read.  maybe i'll nap and then do that.  yeah, that's what i'll do.  it's worth it.  

too early."

"event","not much happened today.  chilled, pilates, recycling and got a new phone.  jammed a bit.  went to zak's and hung out.  it was cool.  saw one of his projects.  black and white film, awes.  then on the way out of zak's house i get this call.

it was jason kiick, but it rapidly was handed over to aaron stokes, the youth minister.  i could barely understand what he was saying, sounded like they were at a concert, but they were on a ski trip.  so i was a little confused, but as it would turn out, that was the youthgroup singing/worshipping.  singing/shouting my song... for the past 25 minutes.  even if i don't go, i do.  stokes told me ""never stop writing, my songs are annointed, never stop.""  and i won't.

that's encouraging, humbling, and bestowing and relieving responsibility at the same time.  

guidance and passion.  motivation as well.  that's what i want.  i should be practicing and writing and reading and developing what i have.  instead i don't.  i waste time like no one else.

"event","went to mt. vernon to keep jason kiick company while he waited for the youth bus for the ski trip.  it was fun.  the took down the tree, then practice.  and practice rocked my friends, hopefully by the next concert we'll have 4 new songs.  that's if i can get my creative writing skills in gear and all.  everything we played tonight was right dead on, it was wonderful, one of those amazing practices that come but once a year.  then to taco bell for dinner.  the proverbial her came up in conversation a lot, and it sort of wears on me after a while.  

got up and walked this morning with leah.  good times, never walked that far at once in my life, except in parades maybe.  good conversation too, it is possible to talk outside of the msn messenger paradigm.  

so cory's coat rocks my face off.  vash the stampede plays bass for my band.  which will be rolling on into atleast next summer.  it's weird how stuff like that just works out.  i still want to play with some guys at school though.  but as it turns out, cory, like myself, is also a drifter.  and we also discussed this over some tacos.  

i let it get to me so easily.  and then it effects so many other things.  rediculously.  ""you're only doing it to yourself.""  i know.

"event","i'm going to demolish this pillow before i even get to college next semester.  i don't think i've set it down in the past 3 hours.  church was good, as it turns out, leah and i had a prophetic conversation last night.  we covered the entire sermon within our conversation, it was odd.  cool, but weird.  and she even said maybe someday she'll be a prophetic lady.  how about today?  why not.  we all ate at long john silver's and got pirate cutout hats.  then we made a snow man, snow dog, and a penguin on a stump.  they rock.  me, steve, leah, and most importantly kyle.  he did the artsy work that makes it look good.  ping pong and goofing with my new pedal.  

lines and boundaries.  slightly erased letters and smudged print.  fuzzy memories, smeared paints, gray areas and i don't know enough to distinguish one side from the other.  it's kind of like taking a yellow to red scale, and throwing blue in the middle of it.  it doesn't belong there, it doesn't make any sense, and the continuity is all screwed up.  

why do drifters drift?  proposition a:  for some reason or another, people don't ever get to know them, so they never get to know anybody else.  not really know them, especially not enough to become attached.  and so it's easy to go.  and they do.  proposition b:  to escape something.  proposition c:  to find something.  

adapting, growing, maturing, whatever you want to call it, you lose stuff and gain stuff.  it's what happens.  so what do i focus on?  gaining.

"event","laura finally got home today, rocking.  watched the terminal.  opened gifts with family around 430ish.  fun times.  lots of stories again.  i've somehow become the designated distributor of gifts christmas mornings/afternoons.  cool stuff all around and viking's gonna flip when he sees what shirt my sister brought me.  

another thing that's sort of inherent in the drifter psyche is ever present feeling of not feeling at home.  

love or trust.

Not much has happened since i last posted in here.&nbsp;broke up with nicole, had sexy ass sex with a few girls, moved... um. band stuff. i don't know. good things and bad things but the new year is here and 2008 is gonna be GREAT!

that's my motto for the year.

"event","i was ""let go"" today from my work. it was the end of my 90 day probation period and they felt that the Central Refill Pharmacy just wasn't for me. it came as a total shock. i'm in the middle of work, they call me into my office and basically tell me that i'm not needed there anymore. it was weird, i thought i was gonna work there for a long time... like, years. so i am, once again, unemployed.

but atleast i can turn this into a positive thing, now i have time to get things doen that i couldn't get done before. and maybe some other things too.

"event","i smoked the reefer for the first time about two weeks ago with my dad. it was on my birthday weekend actually. it's funny because before summer time i originally wanted to get a joint for myself and my dad and have a father/son moment and smoke with him outside up at his house. well, before i had the chance to do that my brother smoked with him and my brother said it was really weird and i kind of changed my mind about wanting to smoke with my dad. since my brother said it was weird, i didn't want to do it.

well, i COMPLETELY forgot that i had ever thought that hahaha. my g/f reminded me that i had said i never wanted to smoke with my dad later that night AFTER i had smoked with my dad haha. i was like ""oh ya, i DID say that.""

ANYWAYS...

i went to my brother's place this past saturday and our cousin was there smoking with my brother (i found out that my cousin is a big stoner now... and also lost a lot of weight. coincedence?) well, i told my cousin about me smoking with my dad and guess what my cousin told me that was even crazier?

my dad and my cousin's mom want to buy some weed through my cousin because he has so many connections hahaha. fucking weird! All of this suddenly pops up now that i'm older. apparently my cousin's mom (my aunt) is a pot head too. i think my dad and aunt are planning on smoking while we're all hanging out in big bear for x-mas.

big bear with me and my friends are coming up, i can't wait.

last night i was riding the BMX around my 'hood and i went to this park by my house and i pulled out my cigar and started smoking and it was really cold out and it TOTALLY reminded me of big bear. i can't wait to go, it'll be sweet. it's so peaceful and relaxing and just awesome up there.

"event","went over to my friend's (ronaldo) got drunk ate pizza and watched ""sky high"" which is a fucking amazing movie. crazy ass shit going down, it seems like it's always there. i wanna have sex really bad, i wish i didn't live an hour away from my girlfriend. i tell people that and they're like ""ooohhhh, how do you know she's not cheating on you?"" i can just tell she's not and if she ever does then i don't really give a fuck, i'll just boot her ass to the ground. but i shouldn't talk ill on my babe, she's an awesome girl because we've both come to the understanding that neither one of us needs the other person, we're both just really good bonuses in each other's lives right now. sex is what i need, and a blow job, and then i need to eat her out. ssshhhh.

alot of shit has changed in the past few months. things now aren't at all like they were 6 months ago and i'm trying to adjust to it still. it's been 3 months.

i've been really horny lately and i've been noticing a lot of girls lately that i haven't noticed before but i would never cheat on my g/f. isn't that how it always goes? when you're single, you take it for granted but then when you get into a relationship with someone, you realize just how many girls you could have had sex with. it's like it was an option before but now that i'm commited to one person i don't HAVE the option. i can only be with her. it's not a bad thing at all but it made me realize how many different girls i could've gotten with. slut? maybe, but variety is the spice of life. people need variety in life, both girls and guys.

"event","""Man wasn't born to do what he does: work all the time for companies that are somebody else's creation. Earn money just so we can throw it away. It's a never ending process, the same cycle repeated over and over and over. Never moving forward, never progressing. Existence is depressing in nature. Ignorance truly is bliss. The more we know, the more we realize how utterly futile and pathetic our existence is. Sometimes I think the crazy ones are the people who realize all this and they snap. They start killing or they become incoherent and their instincts take over. We all repress our true human instincts because they wouldn't be considered civilized in our society. Happiness is the harmony between a man and the life he leads. I am not happy.""

""We're forced to live lives that we don't want to live because of the nature of modern society. Work everyday at a job none of us really enjoy doing just so we can make money. We then spend most of that money on bills on products. We're bred to be consumers and because we like to consume, we have to work to make money. But to be materialistic is like masturbating; it feels good at the time but once it's all over, you're still alone. Buying toys and such just because we want them brings no long term pleasure. After a time we begin to realize the futility of our lives. We're then faced with two choices: either fight against the way we were taught to think, or give in with the rest of society. Most of us choose to give in. The depression of the realization is instant death, that's why we hide the reality from ourselves. WE force OURSELVES to be zombies.""

...i wrote both of these when i first started working full time, which was about 3 or 4 months ago. it STILL sucks working full time but i'm starting to get used to it. i was just really depressed at the time. obviously these two paragraphs can be argued. It was just me rambling. just thought i'd post it so i could throw the scraps of paper that i wrote these on away."

so you get the hippies that don't celebrate the holiday as a means of rebelling against the government and society and conformity. but you know what? you live life once and you might as well have fun with it. so while those people are out doing their own thing i'm gonna spend it with my family and eat a fucking big ass turkey. ya, that's right you fucking pussy vegetarians and vegans, a mother fucking TURKEY! go eat your fucking soy and sniff your coke.

in the meantime, me and my brother will be out in texas with our mommy and probably checking out dallas.

---an online conversation made into a short story---

""I just hate what Britney is doing because it pisses me off and makes me sad that she starts this drama behind mine and Nicky's backs,"" Kevin said angirly at his friend, Ron. ""And she'll call Nicky up and talk shit with her but she won't say a word to me about anything."" 

""Stop hanging out with her then,"" Ron said calmly.

""I can't NOT hang out with her, she hangs with Stacy and me,"" said Kevin. ""And it sucks because as soon as me and Nicky started getting close, Britney started pushing Nicky away from her. They used to be 'best' friends. Like, even when me and Nicky hang with Stacy and Jim and Britney, Britney will completely ignore Nicky. And then she'll call Nicky up telling her that she acts all different when i'm around, which she doesn't.

""Well... stop hanging out with Britney as much,"" Ron said. ""Limit your time so it doesn't give her a chance to talk shit... or do something.""

""Yeah, word huh,"" agreed Kevin.

""Seriously,"" said Ron.

""It'll make her realize that if she wants to talk shit about mine and Nicky's relationship, she just won't see me anymore,"" said Kevin.
 
""Thats what I'd do,"" said Ron.

""But,"" continued Kevin, ""I know she'll blame Nicky for that too! And she's too much of a coward to say anything to my face. But if she keeps this up, I will fucking confront her and be like 'what the fuck!'"" 

""And if she continues doing that,"" said Ron, ""I'd confront her seriously, letting her know that if she values your friendship, it stops now. Otherwise, you cut her off. Blame begins with jealousy-""

""Yeah...""

""-which is written everywhere in this situation.""

""Yeah dude, she tries to make Nicky feel guilty about things Nicky hasn't even done.""

After a moment of silence, Ron asked the question that's been on his mind, ""Is Britney single?""

""Of course, who the fuck would be with that psycho? Even Stacy admitted to me online that when Britney talks shit, she acts all paranoid about nothing.""

""Haha,"" Ron laughed, ""Thats why. All of her best friends are with someone, so shes gonna lash out at somebody.""

""Yeah...  she's just probably jealous by nature.""

""She needs to get laid BIG TIME, haha,"" Ron said mockingly.

""Haha, yeah she fucking does,"" said Kevin, agreeing with Ron that Britney needs to get laid big time. ""God man, it just pisses me off, i've never dealt with this kind of situation before. I'm never the bad guy, NO ONE fucking talks shit on me and the things i do and now all of a sudden someone is and i dont know what to do! Especially since a 'friend' is doing it.""
 
""I know what must be done... I need to seduce her, man,"" said Ron in a seductive tone.

""Hahaha, you would be the man if you were to seduce Britney! It would never happen but that would be a sight to see, haha,"" Kevin laughed along with Ron."

To encapsulate the Druidic philosophy on the ORIGIN OF SOULS, it was
taught that: ""New life-sparks are always coming into being as
emanations from Ceugant."" Such was a system of spiritual evolution
which coincided perfectly with its antithesis: 'physical evoluton'.
Both forms advance through time as a result of learning/exposure and
experience. The Druids felt that all consciousness was essentially the
same - seperated only by a difference of accumulated experience, that
is: humans have been all less-complex things at some point in their
past. A cat's soul, for example, or that of a tree (or any animated
thing), differs little from our own in kind - but only in complexity
and concentration, gained over successive life-cycles. All (degrees of)
souls are eternal, and all are in the process of expanding beyond the
experiential bounds of their present state - heading toward THE BEYOND.
All souls evolve through the Mechanism of Cycles: that supreme Law of
all nature. When a soul of any grade becomes ""saturated"" with the
experiences available within that life-form, then there is movement
onto another higher one. Regression is impossible."

saturday morning we got up and made breakfast and me and james and bobby worked on putting up this huge blue tarp to give us some shade cuz we weren't really in a shady area. later on we found a place to swim and we did just thought and we probably got some virus from the water but it was fun anyways.

sunday we just sat around playing card games and talking and stuff. later on that day we went to rent a boat and there was a fucking waiting list haha. that was a bummer, we didn't even think of that. that evening james and whitney and kristi and bobby all left. only james and whitney had to leave because james had work the next morning but bobby and kristi wanted to go home too haha. so me and nicole and andrew and haylee were left to fend for ourselves. all we did was get drunk and sit by the fireplace and talk and be grumpy at dumbass nighbors haha.

monday morning (july 4th) we got up and just packed all our shit up (cuz we didn't have anymore food) and drove to a restaurant called the grinder or grinder's or something like that in moorpark (i think) and ate there haha. it was delicious! i hung with nicole at her house for pretty much the rest of the day and watched dogma and slackers. we later picked kristi up and went on over to whitney's dad's NEW house. well, the new house for now until they move out to their REAL new house. that house is badass, possibility of moving there but it's far away.

stayed over at whitney's and now i'm home.

friday we made our e.p's and it took forever to drive them to ark's work. dyed my hair black again. watched the dark crystal when james got home. went to nicoles party which was pretty awesome for not a lot of people being there. i got pretty messed up. haylee got drunk, she is a character when she's drunk haha.

saturday, i drove home to get some things and check the house then i drove to the allen. i was the first one there, which is usually rare. that show was pretty lame and boring. whatever. went to ryan's house afterwards for a lil party and what have you. had fun there, didn't go to bed until about 5:20 am.

sunday, hung mostly at ryan's and then drove to the showcase. that show was much better than the allen show. afterwards, went home and hung with james and whitney and jon and ryan for a while. they left and then i slept.

it was seriously a long weekend but now i'm bored. i'm still looking for a job but i need to hurry up because the longer it takes, the more my family starts pushing me and bugging me about it.

AND i might have to pick my cousin up from the long beach airport this friday night which is fucking stupid because i didn't even plan on being here. i planned on being at whitney's by the time my cousin's flight comes in because i'm going camping but no one else is gonna be here either so my mom just threw it on my shoulders. fucking lame. whatever, either i'll figure something out or i'll just be the last one to arrive at the camp site at like 9:30 or some crazy shit like that.

i remember falling sleep on the ground by the toilet and i remember locking the door so no one would disturb me. but then, i woke up this morning on the sofa with a blanket and i don't remember how i got there haha. so, whatever.

today i had brunch at el torito and it was goddamn good.

that's all."

"event","i quit my job today so right now i'm in search of a new one. it has to be either:

1.) closer

2.) if not closer than atleast pay more.

it MUST, however, pay the same or more regardless.

anyways, it felt liberating to free myself from the building, but now i'm feeling kinda down cuz now i gotta look for another job QUICK!

i dropped homesick ep's off at radiation records in anaheim, bionic records in cypress and the electric chair out in h.b. along with some fliers.

i dont really know what else to say. i haven't typed in this thing in a long time. this last weekend was a really good weekend, i played 3 shows. the weekend before that was awesome as well cuz i was in vegas for 4 days. so were natalie and lexi unbeknownst to me.

this job thing is really getting me down. i need to do something that i enjoy or that can atleast keep me busy but i need to be making more than $9 an hour.

i'm gonna be in lakewood soon. oh ya, check this shit out. i plan on moving into my grandpa's house to live with him, me and him discussed it, but he wants me to wait a little while because my cousin and her baby and her baby's daddy are gonna be there for about 2 weeks visiting. well, i told my dad this and my dad was like ""be careful evan, they might try to move in there"", and sure enough BOOM! turns out they've been talking to my grandpa and my grandpa said it's sure that they move out here and live there. they want to live there with him for 2 years so they can focus on going to school and making money and what not. i can't blame them, there's more opportunity out here than in mississippi but it's still a bummer to me. it's like they're trying to butt me out. i know they're not but it's kinda like ""no! i had dibs on this FIRST!"" i bet my grandpa hasn't even told them that i'm moving in there, they'll be surprised.

so, that's kinda shitty cuz i was hoping it would be just me and the grandpa just so it could be quiet for a change. but no, instead of hearing my naggin parents and ass of a brother, now i have to live with a little baby that's not even a year old yet, my hicky cousin whom i haven't seen in a million years, and her husband whom i've never even met. all i wanted was peace and quiet.

i wonder if i could get a job up in ventura somewhere and just live with my dad. that'd be kinda cool but it'd suck too because i'd be farther away from my friends out here than i am right now from my friends in simi. i mean, where my dad lives, simi is still like 40 min. away. to drive from my dad's house to oc would take over an hour. i guess if that ever happened it wouldn't be too bad, i'd just stay for the weekend out here at someone's house like i do at whitney's.

alright i'm done for now, goodnight.

"event","i'm trying to write in this damn thing and luke keeps talking to me.

ok, anyways, a lot has been going on in my life and i haven't really written in this thing for a long time so here it is... all the shizzle in the mofizzle. um, firstly i am grossly engrossed by star wars. the clone wars cartoons came out a long while back and they were badass in their own right, then the movie was soon to come out and my friends started getting into it more and it started sounding more and more interesting. i always liked star wars but was never really a giant fan. THEN i saw the NEW star wars clone wars cartoons and i was even more blown away than the last batch. that got me into it even more. THEN, i went and saw the movie with my friends and i was sucked into it, not to mention all the random awesome stuff my friends dug up about back stories and the histories of characters in the star wars archives. i'm a sucker for huge epic stories that span over generations of the same character. kinda like dragon ball z.

i think i might've already mentioned this but i'm a gametester now at activision. it's a sweet job and the pay is pretty cool but a couple of things suck:

1.) The drive is horrendous! it takes me roughly an hour to get out there (if i leave by 6 a.m.) and it takes me roughly an hour and a half to get back home (when i get out at 5:30). i get up at 5 a.m., out the door by 6 a.m., spend an hour fighting cars that are bumper to bumper with me and then when i get there, which is around 7 a.m., i sleep in the back seat in the parking lot until i have to go in... which is 8:30. haha, then i get out at 5:30. i fight traffic to get to the freeway then i fight traffic ON the freeway and i get home around 7:10 p.m.

then i go to bed at 9:30 to do it all over again.

2.) they haven't put me on any projects yet. i'm still in training, which at this point is basically ""you guys already know how to write up bug reports from the 2 weeks you spent doing it, so here's some old versions of games that have already been released that guys can waste your time on until more new games come in.""

don't get me wrong, it's an easy kick back job but it gets boring as hell.

both bands of mine are doing very well. for goomba we're practicing on a regular basis (1 to 2 times a week) in these practice spaces we've used before. it costs us each time but only like $7 each. we're working on new material and trying to update old material for when we record (which hopefully will begin this summer sometime). homesick abortions, we're getting our e.p.'s on monday for everybody to have for free. they have 3 songs on them which i don't think is bad at all. previous recordings are becoming an issue though. we also have like 4 shows in the month of june and a shitload of shows along the way (i think a shitload...).

my parents found someone to buy the house for, i think it was, $712,000. a ridiculous amount for a ridiculous state. but, that means it's finally sold (after about a week of it being on the market) and we all have to be moved out in 60 days which is around the end of july. not a problem for me, i'm just gonna move into my grandpa's house. he said it's cool i stay there so as long as when i bring a girl over she needs to have two things: either a friend for him or the skills of cooking a good ass breakfast. my brother, on the other hand, is going to move into an apartment with a friend of his. the only problem is they haven't found a place so they need to find one before the 60 days. my parents and the dog are going to texas near my mom's family (because my bloodline goes through a bunch of rednecks which explains the small dosage of it in me), and the cat is going to be given away to a pro-life animals shelter.

a couple of other random things are that next weekend i'm going to be in vegas for 4 days with my friends. last year's trip was amazing so i'm expecting this year's to top the previous. an awesome party was suppose to occur in the month of june but it got canceled because two of my friends (whom i've known for as long as they've been together) might be breaking up because the one cheated on the other. it's a big bummer, they've been together for 4 years. and i'm also looking forward to homesick's album release in the september, not to also mention the hot ass movies coming out this summer including harry potter the book and then the new movie in november.

i think that's about it for now, i'll leave whoever is reading this (or not reading this), this important conversation:

 omit1myself:  jesus christ called me
 SocialRiot:  did he? 
 omit1myself:  and told me that god himself will open the night sky and let the secrets of the universe be revealed in one glorious flash and that my band on july 2nd will be the medium
 omit1myself:  he just wanted to know where to make the rip in the night sky
 SocialRiot:  hahaha 
 omit1myself:  so i'm just letting you know there will be spirit electricity on july 2nd
 SocialRiot:  awesome, fucking awesome

- also -

 omit1myself:  hell yeah
 omit1myself:  im gonna work on playing
 omit1myself:  dude
 omit1myself:  its gonna be sweet
 SocialRiot:  of course it is 
 omit1myself:  thanks daddy
 SocialRiot:  haha 
 omit1myself:  :-*
 SocialRiot:  stop it now 
 omit1myself:  k sorry"

"event","sunday i went to disneyland and it was THUPERRR!!!

i seriously love disneyland so so much. that's probably really sad to hear but i don't think so. i mean, ya, disney is this big comglomerate now that makes money and takes over the world and owns the rights to everything but seriously, disneyland is still such a magical place. SHUT UP!

i used to have an annual pass back when i was 12 and me and my best friend at the time (daniel) would ALWAYS go there and just hang out and go on rides and shit. we knew the ins and outs of the whole park. and we both always wanted to be disney artists when we got older so we'd always go into the animation galleries and look at the pictures and stuff of disney paintings and what not. those were the best times of my life so it always brings back memories everytime i go there. i haven't been since i was 16 so that's why i was excited to go.

anyways, i went with friends and it was rad. i got to go to california adventure for the first time. we drank at a bar in california adventure and got buzzed hahaha. it was awesome, and then right afterwards we went on that rollercoaster ride. that ride, like, it has one loop and whatever and it's not a very ""hardcore"" rollercoaster ride but it's so much fun to go on. seriously, i was laughing the whole time i was riding. it's really a fun ride.

i was nervous riding on thunder mountain cuz it seems, to me, it's the ride that has the most problems. it was david's first time riding the indiana jones adventure thingy. and toon town was fucking awesome! we got to toon town right as the park was closing which was a bummer cuz that's my favorite area but it was still awesome to run around in there with no one there and check everything out.

one of these days i'm going to buy an annual pass. me and my friend ronaldo always say that if walt disney was still alive, the whole disney entrprise would probably be a lot better and a lot more respected instead of it being a money hogging company that pretends to be magical.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in the meantime i think i might go see laura tomorrow if she's not busy and i'm seriously thinking about moving in with my grandpa when my parents move. speaking of which, i'm gonna pretty much be packing up boxes and moving shit and cleaning the house every weekend for the next month. i'm going to try and not let it interfere with band practice, especially homesick."

"event","well, i found out today that the lady was at fault regarding the accident, not me... as it should be. that lady was stupid, not the person i got in the accident with, the lady who was in charge with her insurance. fucking useless. so, anyways, they're going to pay to fix my car AND get me a rental car which is good cuz i'm tired of driving my mom around because i have to use her car. she was really pissing me off today. my mom is a fucking idiot, seriously. she's a typical white washed american working girl. all she does is watch fucking sitcoms, read about celebrity gossip and her logical thinking consists of her emotions and how comfortable she can be. too much to explain but she was really pissing me off, she's been pushing me on the edge lately. speaking of mom, i haven't seen my dad in a long while. he was gonna come to my band's show at the loft this past saturday but he couldn't. i should go up there and hang out with him.

right now i'm eating cookies and listening to toots and the maytails. i bought the dark crystal on dvd today and i also bought a cd cleaner which fucking sucks and doesn't clean shit. i need to start looking for a full time job cuz i gotta move out by june, yikes."

"event","I GOT INTO A CAR ACCIDENT TODAY!!!!!

yay, first time EVER. it wasn't my fault, it was the lady's. anyways, i was nice and she was nice and i guess a lil embaressed. i WAS gonna go to jons but after having to deal with that with having to move our cars and people asking if we needed help and the police and the tow truck driver i just didn't feel like going anywhere. my car isn't too damaged.

these past couple of days have been pretty fucking awesome.

thursday i got off of work and went home and changed and packed some shit up. drove to jon's so i could pick up my drums and drove out to simi valley to whitney's. andrew and haylee and korina were all chillen there with her at her house. we all watched t.v. and i showed whitney the limp wrist video footage... and i ate pizza.

megan called me! which was fucking sweet cuz later that night i drove over to eric's house and i hung with her and escobar and eric and a girl named natalie who passed out on the bed. i didn't ask for any but escobar offered me a hit from the blunt which i thought was pretty rad of him considering i had JUST met him that night. hung there for about an hour or so and then i had to take off back to whitney's.

escobar's right, driving home while high DOES make driving interesting. i drove fine but the whole thing felt like a video game to me haha.

by the time i got back jon and ryan and kerry were already there. even tho i parked right next to ryan's car, i didn't even notice ryan and kerry in there smokin' it up haha. me and jon and whitney had a dope ass jam session. 3 unplugged electric guitars, it was fun. later that night me and james made a suicide drink with mayo and relish and milk and cheese and yogurt and onions and butter and garlic and all kinds of gross shit. only me and whitney and james were ballsy enough to drink it, jon and ryan and kerry watched. that drink was the worst thing ever, as soon as we sipped it our bodies immedietely rejected it hahaha. i immedietely felt like throwing up but i held it down and james was puking all over the place haha. whitney just dropped her cup and ran off haha. it was disgusting.

the next day we just slept in really late and then we packed our shit up and drove to the house where the backyard party was at. at first nobody was there and some lame ass hardcore band was playing. i don't really understand the whole hardcore scene, and i dont necessarily hate the music, but that first band was really awful.

but i DID get to talk to this old man with long white hair. he was holding a comb and he came up to us and started talking. he was talking to me about drums and what not, he was kind of slurring his speach and i could tell he had an accent. he said he was from australia and then he showed me his kangaroo tattoo on his shoulder which i thought was fucking awesome and then he told me he used to be a heroin addict and he was getting help from a church or something or other. he was a really cool guy.

anyhoo, the rest of the night got a little bit better. i saw some people who i hadn't seen in a really long time. we played alright considering it was really cold out and we hadn't practicing in a long time. actually, no, we didn't play that great but people still liked us somehow haha. as soon as brosky's revolt went on they had to stop because el policia came which was a bummer because i wasn't really looking forward to them playing, but then they started up their first song and it immedietely hit me and i just jumped into the pit with jon. but anyways, the party had to close down so people were leaving. i said goodbye to some folks and we all met up at whitney's house, then me and haylee dropped korina off and we drove to some restaurant to eat with whitney and the rest.

later that night we watched fear and loathing in las vegas and james got drunk for the first time in his life! a little too drunk because he ended up throwing up outside and stinking the whole place up haha.

the next morning i drove jon home and went over to ronaldo's, messed around on some music program he just got, and then went home to take a shower and go to work. RIGHT after work i raced home to change then i drove BACK to ronaldo's and we all took off to some club in LA because it was erik's birthday that night (ronaldo's roommate). so we chilled there and drank there the rest of the night. i probably sound like a dick for saying this but mike was being really irritating. like, i was just trying to enjoy myself and enjoy the music and drink and watch the dance-off's (which were really happening) and watch the groups perform but, i don't know, he was being kind of annoying just grabbing me and stuff. whatevs tho, it's all good.

afterwards we bought some hot dogs from a hot dog vender on the street, they were the best hot dogs EVER! we drove back to ronaldo's and smoked and me and david and ronaldo fucking crashed out on his small ass sofa. last thing i remember was looking over at david and ronaldo and seing them asleep, so i laid my head down on david's feet and went to sleep haha.

david woke me up in the middle of the night with his incessant sleep talking. it's more like sleep rambling because he doesn't stop haha. i had to tell him to shut up a few times.

AND THEN i woke up this morning, called jon, told him i'd come over, was driving home to get some stuff to take to jon's and got in the accident.

this was ridiculously long and detailed."

"event","i've had a fuckin kickass weekend!! friday night i went and saw flogging molly and they were fucking awesome. AWESOME! their was a really cool crowd there, some skinhead dude let help finish off his guiness haha. anyways, it was a lot of fun. i got drunk really fast before the show and then i became sober really quickly once the show started. it was, unofrtunately, at the house of anything-but-blues in anaheim and that place fucking sucks, it was still fun. afterwards we ate at the denny's by disneyland.

last night was fucking awesome. awesome like a opossum. got off work and we tried to go to this bar in the krikorian theatre but the damn place isn't even open yet, so we went to this hipster bar i know of in fulerton but it was way packed. seriously, there was no room at the bar and the tables were all taken, so we left and to fucking BJ's haha. i've never been to BJ's before, they have really good beer and the place is nice. ANYHOO, out of no where a group of our friends walked in and we were like ""yo!"" so they drank with us. we all got reaally drunk and i took a smoke of the sticky icky. just one hit, i've been kinda ""blehh"" about the herb lately.

went back to ronaldo's place, sang along to ""american pie"" on the way home, fucking watched star wars.

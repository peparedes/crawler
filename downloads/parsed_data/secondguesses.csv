"event","today i was watching people from the steps of the unca library. seeing people with big personalities from far away, who have lots of friends and things to say--seeing them walk by themselves, too far away for their charisma to wash over me. people are afraid to be alone, but it's not so bad once you get used to it. actually it's rather pleasant. same with silence. you don't always have to be saying stuff.

i avoid people as a rule. even people i really like. because i can't really do smalltalk, it makes me tired and inspires all these existential questions that i really don't want to deal with. so if i don't have anything beyond smalltalk to say, i have no choice but to keep my head down and continue with my business. i'm reading a book right now. you're a first-tier friend, i haven't seen you in two weeks, but i don't want to talk right now. see you later. 

so i guess i could be called a snubber, but i think my sincerity must make up for it to a certain extent. sure, i don't like you--but i really, honestly, earnestly do not like you. or maybe i do like you, but i truly do not want to talk to you. the other side is that if i do want to talk to someone, i am being sincere. what ever happened to sincerity??

and it's not that i have never been snubbed before. there is this guy i know that i used to work with at this restaurant, that goes to UNCA and i see him all the time. he has a wife who i also know and like very much. the first time i saw him, i was all: wow! great to see you! but he just kept on a-walkin'. so i started snubbing him back. snub, snub, snub. it's losing all meaning."

"event","today i got real mad in my fiction writing workshop because everyone was doing a lot of back-slapping and it was churning my stomach. here we are, a bunch of college students putting out incredibly shitty work on all fronts, congratulating each other over our utter non-talent. this one girl was especially getting the praise laid on, and her story HAD NO CONFLICT. does anyone SEE these things? the fucking professor told her to submit it to the school's literary magazine! what is going ON here? get a fucking plot first, then submit it to the goddamn magazine. wow, i don't know why this is making me so angry. of course i didn't say anything, it was kind of like the emperor's new clothes and i was the little boy but in this version i kept quiet and just sort of jiggled the emperor's penis with a long stick.
anywho. well, on the upswing, i splashed ketchup all over a customer at work today. it was this sweet old woman, and i got it on her sweatshirt that had little ducks all over it as well as in her hair. i was standing over her with a wet towel wiping it out of her hair and apologizing profusely. i hate those little fucking ramekins. why can't we have bottles of heinz on the tables like a normal restaurant?
ah, when will the complaining end? 
the new dishwasher at work has blue dreadlocks and was wearing two different shoes. i almost told him that it wasn't good for his back, but suddenly i felt like a middle-aged mother and thought better of it. (i miss the nice mexican dishwashers, i feel like i am dying of hipsters.) am i really getting old? well, yes of course, but actually i've always been like this. my fear of getting old is somewhat false...i just feel like i should be worried about it because i've exited the first half of my twenties. maybe i don't really care about getting old because i didn't really like my youth that much. too much alienation and death. however, i do NOT want, nor do i give permission for, my body to deteriorate in any way, shape or form. if my boobs ever start sagging i'm going to have them removed. not allowed. wrinkles? forget it. not having it. 
i've been avoiding my mother lately. i feel bad about it, because she is so nice. she's just always talking, and it makes me seasick. i am a bad person."

"event","tonite i am home by myself and i accidentally drank a lot of wine. i had a brief burst of inspiration to stay up real late cleaning the house and then that inspiration went somewhere else. ok so, i have lately been feeling pretty happy though useless and somewhat bewildered. sometimes i think i am more often in a state of limbo than not. i think i am getting a job waiting tables soon. oh my god this is coming out stupid. i don't feel stupid but apparently i am.
list time. 10 best things i've done since i've been back. no particular order.
1. swam in the laurel river
2. ALMOST beat brian at tennis
3. cooked really good chicken
4. reduced my bank account to $3.66
5. drank tinto de veranos with andrew
6. called several people saying ""canicomeoverrightnow?""
7. picked raspberries in the back yard
8. loud, bad singing in the car after the cd player broke
9. completed a few personal triathalons
10. ran into the side of the pool while swimming and got lost on the way to the locker room

for one of my classes in spain i had to try to convince people that i went to the maldives when i was nine years old for the wedding of my rebellious cousin. three out of twelve people believed my story versus that of the kid who actually did go to the maldives. a personal triumph. 
today my mother asked me if i spoke fluent spanish and i said no, and she said ""you mean i spent $@#!%& and you're not even goddamn fluent in spanish??"" she's fucking right.
there is some serious noise happening on the porch. i think someone is home.
i have been spending a lot of time thinking about my loved ones lately. just how fucking cool they are. i mean, shit...despite all my complaining about all the stupid fucks i know, i have located some fine comrades. lisa shenouda? she's a classic. god blesser. lee walker? where does he even come from? suzy coady, john wieja, brian evans? best friends ever. lucky me. if it's up to me you're all going to heaven. not that anyone reads this, knock on wood.
this entry is fucking over."

"event","wow, i forgot i had a livejournal. where to start, where to start...well, let-see: i went to europe this summer and had some much needed wild-and-crazy fun. it was hot in spain and i really liked it. now i am thinking about permanently escaping to some oppressively hot place. 
i have more interesting things to say than to talk about ""dry heat"" and things like that. i just read the book ""high fidelity,"" which was very perceptive and hilarious and absolutely charming and all that, and so last night i rented the movie. it was one of those things, it probably would have been good if i hadn't just read the book. i wanted to like john cusack in it but i didn't-- he was too animated, too outward, too angry, and kind of reminded me of a high school student in the senior play. and he would have gotten a standing ovation, mind you, but really it's the senior play and nobody's expecting paul newman or anything. the character in the book was so dry, so understated, so british, more private, and self-absorbed in a much more interesting way. john cusack came off more as a bumbling selfish jerk with an anger problem. i really enjoyed the british style of the book and the american movie remake was somewhat disappointing. i don't know why i bothered renting the movie, i knew this was going to happen. on the upswing, i plan to return the movie on time, even though it was a $1 one-night rental! go get 'em!
i have more interesting things to say than to bitch about a movie that was actually pretty good. i'll post some spain pictures up on here pretty soon.
since i've been back i've been having a lot of fun, and i would hope so since i've been unemployed and on summer vacation. but it's been a good time, i've been swimming every day, sometimes in the pool and on good days in the swimming hole i just found. been playing tennis, eating unjustifiably expensive lunches, meeting up with friends, etc. hesitating on finding a job, and hesitating even more in checking my bank balance. better go do that."

"event","i didn't mean to come off in the last post like i'm into apathy or anything...there's a difference between being realistic and using realism to cover up the fact that you're a lazy piece of shit. it's not that everything is ""okay""--as in it's ""okay"" that we're trying to turn the world into a strip mall, or that it's ""okay"" that the way we're going about things in this country is ass-backwards and cruel and utterly, unforgivably stupid. but there has to be a way to stay sane, other than tuning out, watching sit-coms and smoking pot and getting fat.
on another note, it's amazing how many people in this country smoke pot. in my past life as a dealer in illicit goods, i learned that EVERYONE, people of all stripes, smokes pot. middle-aged suburban men that sit in their garages after their wife goes to bed. old women who don't have glaucoma. small-town priests. middle-aged women who wear tasteful earrings and shop for antiques. i think it is funny that even though i haven't been a pot smoker since high school, i spent years having people assume that i was because i had dreadlocks-- and then there is that real-estate salesman in upton probably still sitting in his garage next to his big glowy coca-cola machine and taking bong hits, no one ever thinking twice.
i'm not trying to make a point. i just enjoy the weirdness of it all. i don't care about the whole ""pot"" thing, don't think it's a very interesting issue. just another social phenomenon, like fashion, or like nascar."

"event","it has been a bit since i've written...
first thing's first...i broke up w. brian a few weeks ago--somewhat traumatic, and a big deal and everything. the worst thing about coming out of a long-term rel. is when you realize all your friends are either ""couple friends"" or they're friends you've neglected for years who now barely remember who you are...okay, i'm exaggerating, but not much. i guess it wasn't just being in a relationship, but more just being so busy all the time. and i still am, so that doesn't help. or does it?
also, weekends tend to suck. they are full of time. time to sit and brood and get madder and madder or sadder and sadder.
thinking abt driving into the city to buy a bottle of whiskey. don't think i will. think i'll read absalom, absalom.
the happy news is that i think i'm going to spain this summer for a month to study, and probably stay a couple extra weeks for traveling and what-not. would like a traveling companion, but i guess it's not necessary. i'm tired of depending on other people anyway. i am especially tired of other people and their ""terms."" i think i am too flexible sometimes, and i let people get away with too much. yesterday morning i almost tore brian a new bumhole...because he made me mad, and i found myself utterly out of patience. i realize that i have been stretching my boundaries to the brink for the past 3 yrs, and i am just done with it all. i realize also that i'm going to get taken advantage of for the rest of my life if i don't draw some lines in the sand now. i realize also that it's pathetic that it's taken me this long to figure that out.
also, i've decided i need a better attitude. i have become a crotchety persnicket. i don't want to go through my life like this. i am like the food critic on three's company that comes to jack's restaurant. he is such a drag. 
william faulkner is one of the most depressing writers on the planet. there is nothing uplifting at all about him or anything he's ever written. i may be exaggerating, but pretty close. but i guess i think that everything is pretty bad, and people are pretty horrible, but it's kind of okay. it's just something to accept. life's hard, it's going to be hard no matter what...you're going to do terrible things, you're going to be majorly disappointed AND a major disappointment, some people are going to hate you, you're going to make irrevocable mistakes, you're going to suffer by your own hand, god doesn't exist, we're going to drive ourselves to extinction at some point... but it's sort of freeing to be able to accept that and see what else there is to know. what else are you going to do? worry? lie to yourself? why bother? 
woops. didn't mean to go on a rampage. was just thinking abt faulkner."

i digress: then we were shooting the shit, mostly about what a bad word ""hella"" is...and before i know it, it's almost eleven...and i'm looking at my french book blankly with my eyelids all heavy. 
but ""hella"" is a profoundly offensive word, and anyone who compares it with the regional and charming ""wicked"" has got their glove up the wrong bum. ew."

"event","oh god, i just read what i wrote yesterday and i wrote ""sister and law"" instead of sister-in-law. i'm so embarrassed. in my defense, i think i was hung over.
this is bad, i am procrastinating to a shameful extent. i swear i'm going to start practicing my french in a couple minutes. right after i write this. i swear. and then i'm changing the kitty litter. well, okay, that's a lie. but still doing the french.
today was MLK day, and it was slow at the coffeeshop (i made a whopping $8 in tips)...it was kind of fun though, we did the ny times saturday crossword and all the customers helped. and then my boss said ""we should do something special for martin luther king day. maybe we can give free coffee to everyone who's drinking it black."" and the general consensus was that it was tasteless, but privately funny.
also today, brian's car wouldn't start so i had to pick him up and lend him my car, and get a ride home from work from my boss. he came home last night from a camping trip with the best black eye i've ever seen, complete with caked-on blood. he looked straight out of a calvin and hobbes comic strip. apparently he was bush-whacking through the woods in the pitch dark and somehow a large stick smacked him in the head. it hit him so hard he passed out for a second. you can't make this shit up!
alright, enough fucking around...time to get down to business."

"event","last night my brothers and sister and law came over and brought pizza. we sat at the kitchen table and got rollicking drunk. then i passed out on the couch and woke up this morning with my 3-year-old niece's face in mine. 
my brothers and i are making a list of all of our father's old sayings. some of my favorites: 
""goooooood morning""
""strong like bull""
""put some hair on your chest"" (said regardless of gender)
""i could go for some corned beef and coupe de schmelty on a hard roll with a side of waxed beans""
""head 'em up, head 'em out, HOHHHHHHHH!!!""

he had more sayings than anyone i've ever known. his speech was pretty much the same 25 sayings arranged in different fashions. it is nice to have a way to remember him. i've been feeling sorry for myself lately because i have to buy a car and that's a real ""dad"" activity...you bring your dad and he haggles for you and checks things on the car that you never would have thought of. instead i have to bring my brother, who embarrasses me in public on a regular basis. it has been almost exactly 10 years since he died. it seems like the more time goes by, the older i get, the bigger the hole gets. death is amazing. it just never gets easier to deal with, it is so shockingly unrelenting. i think part of it is i see myself growing more like him, and my brothers too, and his absence seems to get more and more conspicuous. 
kay, i'm done wallowing in self-pity. just gotta do it once in awhile.
anyway, i've had a really good 3 days. i think i am actually starting to love my life again. or at least like it. i've pretty much been in a year-long slump. it's amazing, fucking AMAZING, what a regular sleep schedule will do for you. i highly recommend it . i can't get over how much energy i have! i don't even know what to do with it all. i am spazzing out. i walked out of the licker store last night and got in the car and yelled in a british accent, ""let's ROCK!!!"" and the people in the car next to us heard me through closed windows and laughed at me. anyway, i am really appreciating the break from the depression-- i was not completely aware of how shitty i've been feeling until i started feeling better. but there were a couple moments where i really didn't know if i was ever coming back.

i am wasting time. i have homework and my house is a wreck and i need desperately to bathe. i want to figure out how to put pictures and stuff up on here."

"event","woops. i just erased my entire first paragraph.

classes start tomorrow, so i am going to give a valiant effort at the thomas wolfe novel tonight before i have no time
for leisure reading. i am taking a whole class  on faulkner for which i will have to read 8 novels. hmmm. 8 novels in 12 weeks, plus 5 other classes. i am SO watching the movie.

today i met the guy who started Lark Books, a publishing company in asheville. apparently he sold it and now has more money than god and lives at the top of a mountain with a huge pottery studio. he was a wiseguy. he was like ""where are you going to school?"" and then ""oh, that's good, because there are a lot of jobs here. a lot of really great jobs."" that was sarcastic. asheville has no jobs. and while i worry about this occasionally, i have some inexplicable device in my brain that makes me believe it'll all work out. i don't know why someone as neurotic as myself is so unworried about such real things, but i am thankful for it. i mean, worrying's worth doing, but it's also pointless. 

i am eating cold leftover tortellinis with my fingers. new paragraph.

i don't know what i'm going to do with my evening. secretly i don't even feel like reading my book. maybe i will take a bath, and sit in the bathtub till i am shriveled up. i'm feeling isolated.

the life aquatic
the thomas wolfe novel
an article about pre-roman italy in this month's national geographic
the cafeteria at school: they thought of everything!
my new yellow coat
leave-in hair conditioner
eggs for breakfast: ""eggs: not just for lunch anymore!""
english muffins: ""english muffins: yet another way to eat butter!""
townes van zandt
drinking at bars

i am developing two beatles theories right now. the first one is, i think maybe the guy who killed john lennon was a time traveler from the future. and he came back to end john lennon's career before he succumbed to 1980's pop. because i think john lennon was the type of musician that could have gotten really ugly in the eighties. i mean, he was great, of course he was great. but look what happened to rod stewart. elton john. even bob dylan in the eighties. let's be honest, it was rough. the guy who killed him had seen too many duets with michael jackson, too many music videos involving yoko wearing tutus, too many tacky beatles reunion tours. too many overly instrumented songs, awkward jewelry and hairspray. he couldn't take it anymore.
now i am too tired to discuss my second beatles theory. i got too excited over the first theory."

"event","here's a thought...chances are, if you state upon your livejournal that you are ""mysterious,"" i think that you are, by definition, fooling yourself. you're an open book. if you're willing to state in public that you believe yourself to be ""mysterious,"" you cannot possibly be mysterious.

i need to post a picture of myself on here that does not involve some element of baker's garb, but i don't have any yet. i am slowly wrenching off my Entrepeneurial Baker identity. i guess it was easy for those years to have such a simple representation of myself to put forth to the world. 

somehow i pictured that when i left my bakery, i would be frollicking in some sort of misty meadow, licking ice cream cones with crowds of friends, y'know, doing a lot of laughing in the sunlight. instead i am stuffed up in my little cabin alone in winter with a laptop and too many pets. but my new job is marvellous. i guess i had initially come off to my boss as ""meek,"" as i'm sure i often do when i meet people, but it has not taken him long to see that i'm a bit fiesty. in fact, i think my meek persona might be an elaborate facade to cover the fact that at heart i am as mean as they come.

i like big talkers. i especially like the unselfconsciousness of big talkers. whenever i end up talking a lot in a conversation, later i neurotically fret about whether i was talking too much or being inconsiderate or boring. 

the book i'm reading is splendid. i started reading Look Homeward Angel (thomas wolfe) out of a feeling of obligation, because it's set in asheville, but i was pretty much anticipating it to be a boring drone of a read. to my delight, it is a profoundly fabulous and breathtakingly written book. i recommend it to you, you and you."

Top Ten Reasons for Living Right This Second (in random order):
the new york times crossword puzzle
the thomas wolfe novel i'm reading
cashmere
a bunch of movies i've never seen
65-degree winters
the quest for making the perfect latte foam
the quest for making a perfect fried egg
scalding hot showers
the next Cook's Illustrated magazine
my small town full of gems and townies

not the most inspiring list, but it'll do. you never know, it could get more exciting at some point, and in reality i think secretly that is the reason that tops everyone's list at all times.

the name of the game at the top of this fresh year is Turning Over a New Leaf. i'm trying to be more sane this year. so far it's working, in spite of the fact that i am in a perpetual state of losing It. 
i think i need more friends. the thing with me and friends is that...sigh. i have no internal editor. i have an on/off switch. most of the time i leave it on the off switch because the on switch is unpredictable. boring me? funny me? angry me? saying too much me? comely and poised me? interesting, engaging, and thoughtful me? way out in left field me? drunk me? fixated on a small detail me? 
you never can tell.

that's enough for today. i've got to put up some wallpaper or something, i can practically hear myself echo in here."

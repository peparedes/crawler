"event","Finally Christmas Break has arrived.  The past week has gone by at an agonizing 2 miles an hour as opposed to the normal 50000000000 mph.  Very much slower.  My only problem is that I haven't done all my shopping and it is Dec. 21.  That is bad.  I am prolly not gonna go for my cousins until after Christmas to take advantage of the sales.  I get to sleep in which is a HUGE plus cause I am terribly sleep deprived.  Today was rather uneventful besides the fact that it was the day afore Christmas break.  Starting tomorrow I get to go to the church every day and do something related to Christmas Eve.  It is fun though.  My body is a baby factory and I need to make sure that my dates know that it is closed until further notice.  To make sure that I don't accidentally start the manufacturing process, i need to wear a net and have my date wear one.  Then we have to go to the lake for a picnic and he has to feed me.  If I would like to see this again, I need to go to http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/6806/Tipper0.html.  Now, in the words of a very great lady, ""You are the weakest link, goodbye."""

"event","The event is that my parents are throwing another open house, this time for our church friends.  There were these kids and my mom elected me to take them on a tour of our house.  They were my shadow's new body mates for the rest of the time they were here.  They are cute, but the boy kept messing with this singing gorilla that sings wild thing.  it is fun once, but after three times it is annoying.  They have gone to spend time with their father.  Now my e-mail is not letting me get out of this one e'-mail.  it is bothering me.  White chocolate oranges are good.  gtg"

"event","I ended up surviving the escape from my quarters.  It was quite easy actually.  The enemy was caught up in in depth conversations about who has ended up marrying who.  I returned to my quarters virtually unscathed.  I was very stealthy in the getting of my provisions.  My mother blew my cover by announcing my presence, but I escaped un-noticed very shortly afterwords.  One day has passed since that terryfing experience.  I don't know what I want from my secret santa in 4n6.  My new duo is rea funny.  I can't wait until I perform it.  It is fun.  I am doing it with Brynne.  It has parts that we will hafta cut out.  It is about rubbing anntenae and rubbing proboscis together.(the part to cut)  I am bored so I will go.  I don't have much to say."

"event","My mummy is havin a x-mas partay for her league of women voter friends.  They are old republicans and they are boring to talk to.  I have locked myself in my room in an attempt to stay away from them.  Thus far, I am succeeding, but I don't know how much longer I will be able to hold out.  I am running low no provisions and I will be forced to head out for more where I will be faced with almost certain death.  I also have to use the latrine.  Goodbye.
I hope to see you again, Angry(code name)"

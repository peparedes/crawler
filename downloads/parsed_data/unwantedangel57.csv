"event","Life has been going alirght the past few years. Last time I wrote in this I was a young stupid immature freshman. Now i'm just and older stupid immature junior. Oh how times have change... I dont really have much to say in this. I now have very strong political views... I dont like to share these with people because i dont see a point. I know what I need to know and that's good enough for me. I am talking to Jen right now and she is DYING to go to London, England.&nbsp; Haha ohhh Jenz. I love almost everything about England. I love the ancient history, the language, the sea, the cute boys, even the gloomy weather. I've never been during the spring but my cousins always send me pictures of their garden. One of the pictures is of a climbing white rose bush. It is up against a stone wall which is lightly covered with moss and ivory. There is fog in the air but still rays of the sun gleaming down. I dont know where the picture is anymore but, I loved it. Everyone talks of how dark and depressing England is, but it's the things like that rose bush that make it beautiful. Right now my family lives in an house that was built in 1690. It's just a few hundred years old... nothing big.... [Borat] NOT. It's beautiful! I love walking around in the neighborhoods pretending to be in the 1500's victorian-ish life. Kinda lame, I know, but all i'd really like is a huge dress, a sexy British boy, and a giant castle... and i'm set! SIGN ME UP MON. Anyways, I should get going now. Maybe i'll update in another two years? Who knows. Love Always And Forever. Daphne Maria."

"event","Hey everyone! Wow, I totally forgot I even had this journal. What's up kids? I'm doing alright. I'm still kinda sad about Nick dumping me. This time, i'm not afraid of saying my feelings and i'm not afraid to tell anyone. I still like him and i'm going to tell him. It's really wierd though. When Adam dumped me, I felt so much more hurt and depressed than I do now. I'm very glad I wasn't hurt as bad as I was when Adam dumped me, but it makes me wonder why that is? I'm not sure why Nick dumped me, he kept changing his answer, and finally I got fed up with the guessing game, so I hung up. I still want to know. It makes me think... Anyways... I'v also become more... I dont know how to say it, like... I can say things when I'm mad, and I dont feel like I always have to hold it in. I use to never tell if something was pissing me off. It's a lot easier now, but I still have a hard time getting it out, and I dont do it always. I'v also become more direct with my dad. I'm not afraid to tell him what I want or what I dont want to do. I actually have the guts now to ask him if I can hang out with friends on Friday nights. I'm also getting better at asking him if I can go home early. It's so hard to talk to him and ask him if I can do these things. I guess I just feel bad for him, because he's only here for me, and when I ask not to be with him, I'm sure its hurts. But he is my dad, and I have a life. On a happier note... I'm going to Spain in 2 days. It finally hit me and now i'm really excited. I'm really excited because this is my excuse to walk around the city in a dress and be pretty. I have become so much more of a girl over the past year. In 8th grade, I would show up when i hadn't showerd that morning or the night before... I didn't care what people thought of me, so I didnt try to look nice. I still dont care what people thing, but sometimes I just want to look nice. It's fun playing dress up. Sometimes I miss 8th grade. We all were friends, and then we split up. I can still remember all the good times we all had and it makes me sad that it wont be like that again. Oh well, thats life, and thats people! I better go shower. LoveAlwaysAndForever- Daphne"

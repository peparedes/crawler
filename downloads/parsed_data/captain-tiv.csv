http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/407744/20121122/google-island.htm?cid=5#.UK7h_iqF_kE

An island off the South Pacific has been discovered to be a hoax or non-existent by a group of Australian scientists, despite being visible on marine charts and world maps, even on Google Earth.

The land mass, named Sandy Island, was supposedly located between Australia and New Caledonia. It is identified as Sable Island by the Times Atlas of the World.

But when scientists from the University of Sydney, aboard Southern Surveyor, a new Marine National Facility research vessel, went looking for the island to confirm its existence, it found only a massive 1,400 metres or 4,620 feet of blue deep ocean waters.

The scientists were puzzled with the discovery.

""Even onboard the ship, the weather maps the captain used had showed an island in this location,"" Dr Maria Seton, the voyage's chief scientist, said.

For at least a decade, the non-existent island has been featured in a number of publications relative to geography and marine subjects.

""We wanted to check it out because the navigation charts on board the ship showed a water depth of 1,400m in that area - very deep,"" Dr Seton told the AFP after a 25-day voyage.

""It's on Google Earth and other maps so we went to check and there was no island. We're really puzzled. It's quite bizarre.""

""We all had a good giggle at Google as we sailed through the island, then we started compiling information about the seafloor, which we will send to the relevant authorities so that we can change the world map,"" Steven Micklethwaite from the University of Western Australia said.

But according to some forums, such as www.abovetopsecret.com, the questionable existence of the island was deliberately placed on the map.

""Many mapmakers put in deliberate but unobtrusive and non-obvious 'mistakes' into their maps so that they can know when somebody steals the map data,"" an unidentified commenter was quoted by ABC News.

A Google Earth spokesman said they refer to a diversity of authoritative sources when creating their maps.

""The world is a constantly changing place,"" the spokesman told AFP, ""and keeping on top of these changes is a never-ending endeavor.""

http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/technology-blog/meteor-explodes-over-england-violent-force-212434670.html

If you catch them at just the right time, a streaking meteor can be a stunning sight in the night sky. But when that meteor contains just a tiny bit of ice, a beautiful light show can turn into a violent explosion, as happened in the skies over Great Britain last night.

The extraterrestrial explosion occurred just over South Wales in southwest Great Britain. The meteor rocked windows and set off car alarms, creating a sonic boom effect. Explained one witness, prior to the detonation ""It had a heat trail behind, it was orange and white and very bright, and also seemed very close."" No one was hurt.

"event","Depending on the couple, I'm a shipper.

Sometimes, I'm not a shipper, but I like it when a certain couple gets together during a movie. 

Then there are those couples who are 'meant to be' in fiction. We're comfortable with these stories when they play out in a familiar way no matter how many versions we see.

Zorro always gets the pretty girl, usually the enemy's daughter.
Mr. Darcy always ends up with Elizabeth Bennet.
Jane Eyre ends up with Mr. Rochester.
Romeo and Juliet? Yeah, and if their parents had just sprung for a wedding, they could have saved them the costs of a double funeral.

But this sort of took me by surprise. Now it's not that I haven't considered the pairing -- I have. It's not that I haven't wondered about the pairing -- I have. I'm not in the comic book world anymore, but I always wanted to see a story like this play out in a comic when I did read them, but it never happened. 

Superman and Wonder Woman as a couple?

Yes, friends, it's happened in comics before, it's happening again (or so I've read), but to actually see it in print? That made me wish they'd done this back when I was a kid and into Superman comics. ::vbeg::

The New Power Couple: Superman and Wonder Woman
http://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/power-couple-superman-wonder-woman-173611174.html

So Superman isn't with Lois Lane, Wonder Woman isn't with Steve Trevor. ::sigh::

And when you're so used to a particular couple being together in fiction, someone somewhere takes a plotline you'd have always loved to have read and actually makes it happen. *g*

Why couldn't they do this back in the 70's when comics were only a quarter each and had about 100 pages of drawings?"

Here's what initiated this dilemma. I've got an itty bitty MP3 player. It has a 1.5"" screen. Needless to say, that's a bit small to watch a video on. ::vbeg:: It does get FM radio through. 

Anyway, there were some refurbished 4gig MP3 players with a 3.5"" screen on sale for $30, and I got two (one was a gift). I checked them out. One wouldn't charge due to a faulty plug and the other lost the sound after 30 minutes. Naturally, they both went back. 

So, a searching we did go.

I looked at an IPOD. It's the size of a smart phone. Great for music and watching vids and going online, but what you see online is a truncated version. It cost $149. Then there's the slightly larger gadget that's between the size of a smart phone and an IPAD. It ran about $200. Naturally, the IPADs are $500, and I'm not that thrilled about things that don't use keyboards and from what I hear, they don't take a jump drive.

I've found a few others that are only sold online, so there's no way to look at it, play with the buttons, see how heavy it is, etc. 

Any one got any recommendations?"

<i>I apologize for the inconvenience. However, this is a production issue. The Sherlock programming comes to us via the Masterpiece Mystery series. When we get the series through PBS it may be cut down. We do not have control over this. Normally PBS likes to keep programs within a certain timeframe to accommodate local have a few minutes between programs to promote the next program and to start the next program on time. This may be why you may have noticed some edits because PBS requires a certain length for all programs. We do not make these decisions at the local level. They are made at the national level and we are only able to air what is sent to us.</i>"

This humorous diet is designed to help you cope with the stress that builds up during the day.

<b>Instructions for Stress Diet:</b>

<b>BREAKFAST:</b>
1/2 grapefruit 
1 slice whole wheat toast 
8 oz. skim milk 

<b>LUNCH:</b>
4 oz. lean broiled chicken breast 
1 cup steamed spinach 
1 cup herb tea 
1 Oreo cookie

<b>MID-AFTERNOON SNACK:</b>
The rest of Oreos in the package 
2 pints Rocky Road ice cream, nuts, cherries and whipped cream 
1 jar hot fudge sauce 

<b>DINNER: </b>
2 loaves garlic bread 
4 cans or 1 large pitcher Coke 
1 large sausage, mushroom and cheese pizza 
3 Snickers bars 

<b>LATE EVENING NEWS: </b>
Entire frozen Sara Lee cheesecake (eaten directly from freezer) 

   
   
<b>RULES FOR THIS DIET:</b>

1. If you eat something and no one sees you eat it, it has no calories.

2. If you drink a diet soda with a candy bar, the diet soda cancels out the calories in the candy bar.

3. When you eat with someone else, calories don't count if you do not eat more than they do.

4. Food used for medicinal purposes NEVER counts, such as hot chocolate, brandy, toast and Sara Lee Cheesecake.

5. If you fatten up everyone else around you, then you look thinner.

6. Movie related foods do not have additional calories because they are part of the entertainment package and not part of one's personal fuel. (Examples: Milk Duds, buttered popcorn, Junior Mints, Red Hots and Tootsie Rolls.)

7. Cookie pieces contain no calories. The process of breaking causes calorie leakage.

8. Things licked off knives and spoons have no calories if you are in the process of preparing something.

9. Foods that have the same color have the same number of calories. (Examples: spinach and pistachio ice cream; mushrooms and mashed potatoes.)

10. Chocolate is a universal color and may be substituted for any other food color.

11. Anything consumed while standing has no calories. This is due to gravity and the density of the caloric mass.

12. Anything consumed from someone else's plate has no calories since the calories rightfully belong to the other person and will cling to his/her plate. (We ALL know how calories like to cling!)

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/tenacious-summer-analyst-applicant-got-laughed-at-by-everyone-else-on-wall-street.html

s summer analyst recruiting season continues and superdays near, Wall Street has been having a laugh with one New York University applicant who, to say the least, took a surprisingly dogged approach with his cover letter. 

He wrote:

""I am unequivocally the most unflaggingly hard worker I know, and I love self-improvement. I have always felt that my time should be spent wisely, so I continuously challenge myself ... I decided to redouble my effort by placing out of two classes, taking two honors classes, and holding two part-time jobs. That semester I achieved a 3.93, and in the same time I managed to bench double my bodyweight and do 35 pull-ups.""

Since Thursday, February 2, when a Bank of America Merrill Lynch director forwarded the cover letter out to his entire team, offering drinks ""to the first analyst to concisely summarize everything that is wrong with"" the note, it has passed through more than a dozen firms. 

Already investment banking and accounting teams at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Nomura, Citi, Deutsche Bank, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Wells Fargo, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Perella Weinberg Partners, and Barclays Capital have read the note, along with the student's relatively robust resume. 

The letter, which read with perhaps a tad much hubris, comes at a time when summer recruiting is at its peak and anxiety among the nation's junior class is high. Resume drop days, or the deadline when resumes must be received, have largely passed, and students are now in the throes of first round interviews and superdays.

~*~*~*~*~

The comments people write in after reading the entire letter is fun to read too. 

Granted, this guy definitely got their attention, but I do have to wonder at these business people's response to the letter. They want something that stands out, right? Well, here it is. Unprofessional, not the right venue, sure, but definitely attention-getting."

Rock song, the lyrics don't say it but interpreters say it's talking about the devil or the afterlife.

It's one of those really big 'classical' pieces, kind of like Send Me An Angel by the Scorpions. Absolutely gorgeous score with poetic lyrics.

It's not Stairway to Heaven or Sympathy for the Devil or Don't Fear The Reaper.

I loved Doctor Who from the start. We got the show back in the 80's starting with the Jon Pertwee episodes. I was hooked the moment I saw the first one. We got the Pallisers at the same time, and I really liked that show too. I spent a lot of time on my local public tv station. ::vbeg:: Anyway, when I went to London in the late 80's, I found out that there was one lady in particular was a ginormous fan. We had a lot to talk about. :)

We had speakers come in to talk to us every morning if we wanted to listen. One was an actor who got eaten by a chair in the Doctor Who episode Terror of the Autons. I had seen a rerun of the episode just a few weeks before we went to London, so I recognized the actor immediately. I went up to talk to him, eventually, it came around to his being in the episode. Naturally, I told the other fan on the tour, and she went to talk to him. He was surprised and impressed that we knew who he was even if it was only for a Doctor Who episode. What was really funny was when he said, ""I just found out that the reason I'm known was for being eaten by a plastic chair in Doctor Who."" He got giggles from the tour group. :)

I found the chair eating moment on YouTube. :) It even has the original Master! I really liked that one.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXrAK6sUZ_0
You have to skip the ad.

So there's no real point to the post, just a bit of fluff where I can say I met the actor in this episode once. *g*"

"event","Google to merge user data across its services

http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/24/tech/web/google-privacy-policy/index.html?hpt=hp_t3

(CNN) -- Google plans to start combining information the company collects about each user of its various websites and services into a single profile, the company announced on Tuesday.
Previously, Google said it did not create comprehensive profiles across its various properties, including its leading search engine, Android smartphone operating system and YouTube video site.

In a statement, Alma Whitten, a Google privacy director, wrote that the changes ""will mean a simpler, more intuitive Google experience."" She added, ""Our recently launched personal search feature is a good example of the cool things Google can do when we combine information across products.""

That change, called Google Search Plus Your World, brought criticism from rivals Facebook and Twitter, which said that Google+ content now buries their own pages in Google's search engine, and from people who do not care to use Google's new social network.

The new privacy policy, too, has already sparked concerns voiced on social networks, including on Google's own platform.

""Google consolidating data -- gives me some cause for concern,"" Robert Mason, a professor of information technology at the University of Washignton, wrote publicly on his Google+ profile.
A Google spokeswoman declined to comment and instead referred CNN to Whitten's statement and a brief document posted on the company's website. The latter notes that Google does not sell users' personal info to other companies, and that people who do not like the changes can close their accounts.

Google uses some of the data it collects based on people's usage in order to deliver advertisements customized to individuals.

Whitten boasted in her company blog post that the single, shorter privacy policy should appease government regulators who have called for simplifications across the industry. Facebook made a similar claim last year when it removed much of the legal jargon from its privacy agreement.

<b>Google's new privacy policy will go into effect on March 1. It applies to everyone who is logged into a Google account while searching, checking Gmail, watching YouTube videos or downloading apps to an Android phone.</b>

The company plans to send e-mails to users and post a notification on its home page about the changes, Whitten wrote."

http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/20/business/megaupload-shutdown/index.html?hpt=hp_t3

(CNN) -- U.S. authorities overreacted in shutting down the online file-sharing site Megaupload and seeking criminal charges against its executives, the company's American lawyer said Friday.

""We believe that the allegations are without merit and Megaupload is going to vigorously defend against the case,"" attorney Ira Rothken said.
Federal authorities shut the site down Thursday, the same day they announced indictments against seven people connected to the site, accusing them of operating an ""international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works."" Four of those charged were arrested Friday in New Zealand at the request of U.S. authorities.

The site, which traffic-tracking service Alexa ranked as the world's 72nd most visited website before it was taken down, allowed users to share and download files, many of which were copyrighted works made available for download without permission, according to authorities.
Rothken said the case demonstrates a ""copyright extremist mentality"" on the part of U.S. authorities and raises significant due process and consumer protection issues.

He said it was inappropriate for U.S. authorities to seize the company's servers and domain names, not to mention $50 million in assets, without a court hearing.

He also said the seizure means consumers who had stored legitimately acquired materials on sites owned by Megaupload can no longer access them.

The seizure ""has essentially created a chilling effect on consumers using Internet cloud storage going forward,"" Rothken said."

http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/20/technology/SOPA_PIPA_postponed/index.htm?hpt=hp_t3

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- When the entire Internet gets angry, Congress takes notice. Both the House and the Senate on Friday backed away from a pair of controversial anti-piracy bills, tossing them into limbo and throwing doubt on their future viability.

The Senate had been scheduled to hold a proceedural vote next week on whether to take up the Protect IP Act (PIPA) -- a bill that once had widespread, bipartisan support. But on Friday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he was postponing the vote ""in light of recent events.""

Meanwhile, the House of Representatives said it is putting on hold its version of the bill, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). The House will ""postpone consideration of the legislation until there is wider agreement on a solution,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith said in a written statement.

The moves came after several lawmakers flipped their position on the bills in the wake of widespread online and offline protests against them.

Tech companies, who largely oppose the bills, mobilized their users this week to contact representatives and speak out against the legislation. Sites including Wikipedia and Reddit launched site blackouts on January 18, while protesters hit the streets in New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Google (GOOG, Fortune 500) drew more than 7 million signatures for an anti-SOPA and PIPA petition that it linked on its highly trafficked homepage.

The tide turned soon after the protest, and both bills lost some of their Congressional backers.

""I have heard from the critics and I take seriously their concerns,"" Smith said Friday in a prepared statement. ""It is clear that we need to revisit the approach on how best to address the problem of foreign thieves.""

PIPA and SOPA aim to crack down on copyright infringement by restricting sites that host or facilitate the trading of pirated content."

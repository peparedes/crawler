"event","it's 3:30 and I'm trying to stay up cause I'm meeting my freshman seminar group at Baker Rink at 5:30 to leave for Bermuda and I'm afraid that if I let myself fall asleep I won't wake up even if Jack does call at 5. I just finished a night of movies: Fight Club in Witherspoon with Nithiya, Emily, Luis, and this girl whose name I don't know and just now Amelie with Jane and Sarah. Missed an outing to the Met with Sarah and Jane this afternoon / evening because of class and Jane being worried about me going through sketchy parts of the city alone. Jane and Sarah almost got arrested at the Met for ""trepassing"" into a roped-off exhibit. 

This week has been full of late-night midterm studying and paper writing. late Sunday for chem on monday which I miraculously managed to make no stupid math mistakes on. Monday night for bio paper which managed to be a great pain to print, Wednesday till 2:30 at Frist with Emily. Thursday I signed this big six-foot book outside Frist supporting the cause against Global Warming. Our seminar when to the pool to practice snorkeling and Dr. Z gave  us PEI caps which according to Emily makes me look like a backcountry hick. One of these nights, a sleep-deprived and school stressed Waters appeared at my door and I went in search of bagels with her. I've seen way too little of her recently which I'll make an effort to change after break and I never got to say goodbye to her. Last night was ""halloween at princeton"" - our puppet show fell through for a number of reasons though now we're planning a christmas scrouge show instead. John rather vaguely said he'd take me to the Street a few nights before so I at the last minute decided to be a doll. I got no response from him until almost 12 because he was at some frat party with Adam. For a while there we thought he'd actually stood me up and Jane and Emily were prepared to get revenge. I feel so lucky to have made friends here who really do care and get worried and actually would have given John hell. I finally meet John down by the corner of Blair where he was on P-watch with Adam. We sat down there for like an hour or so talking and then went down to the U-store where we got ridiculously over-priced dumpling that we warmed up back in the kitchen in his dorm which I finally got to see. We found some of the ""octagon"" just beginning to watch ""Independence Day"" and pretty much stayed there the entire night watching the rest of the movie and meeting more people as they filtered in and out. I came back at a little past three and was in the bathroom when Jane came back just a little later and freaked when she saw me not in bed and woke emily up who proceded in wake Waters up when I came back from the bathroom. 

It feels really weird to be leaving here in only a few hours if only for a week. Though this may not be the ""perfect match school"" I can't imagine being anywhere else now and I know I'm really going to miss it even for this week, though I am still so excited for Bermuda. One week seems like such a long time when you live with people 24 hours a day, though these first six weeks have flown past and there's many things I wish I hadn't done, and many more I wish I had."

"event","Despite the fact that's it almost 3 in the morning I feel the need to journal this day / yesterday as it has been one of the most eventful and best days here yet. 
Starting with yesterday night / morning, when I decided to stay in instead of going to the Street w/ Waters. It started as an attempt to spend the night studying but soon Emily and I attacked the very messy common room, soon to be joined by a very delirous and sleep-derived Jane: we put down a rug, set up a lamp, added numerous wall hanging: degas poster, poster that says ""a woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle"", food for thought pictures, pictures from a frog poster and a sign above the door that says ""which of these frogs is not like the other?"" just to screw with people, and a poster sleepy Jane decided to make when she detested this one ugly poster and realized she had pastels - it's a very colorful abstract picture, though quite well done. I must say she's quite hilarious when she's tired - upon finding the pastels she blasted her music despite it being 2 in the morning and the guys below us sleeping and said she'd draw the song ; duck-taping the bookshelves together that technically aren't stackable. 

Finally went to bed around 3 and slept in till 10. Meandered around in the morning - got brunch w/ emily, stephen, and mike - made napkins with love-notes to Keith that we were planning on putting on our trays so they'd go back to the kitchen where we thought he was cleaning dishes only to find that he was swipping cards (which he'd been doing the wrong way for some time). Went back to the room, wandering around again doing chem problem set. Decided to go to lawn parties with Jane at the last moment - wandered around the eating clubs for awhile looking for people - finally went to Quad to catch the end of the Folds and most of Everclear w/ Huan, Waters / Peter, Jane, and numerous other people. Leaving slightly early to miss the crowd. Getting dinner w/ emily and john and most of his z-group; ice cream and walk back with John. Bio reading in the common room, which is now so enticing that we can't help but actually read it. Two consecutive fire alarms - Matt trying to be happy about them. More bio. Study break to find cereal for emily in dining hall (Jane to murray dodge for cookies - I'm glad Jane is warming on us and that we're getting to know her better). We run into Waters who was carrying a huge pan of lazzana which they were apparently going to throw out so we helped her eat part it - discussions of boys and random stuff - tired Waters = loud / funny - we managed to scare Ada away by being too loud. Back to the room for more bio before going off to the computer cluster in Holder to print stuff. Running into Newton and his friends / roommates - climbing through their window to find a bunch of random people in their room - singing happy birthday to a rather disgruntled Sian and writing on their white boards. After printing back to the common room for communal bio reading for emily and I and french for Jane. Grace stopping by at somepoint asking for microwave and laughing at Jane; running into Aba (our RCA) at 2:30. Not quite finishing bio, but emily forcing me to stop and go to sleep, which clearly I'll do soon. But as emily said before she went to sleep, I'm content, it's been a good day."

"event","Some random events that need to be recounted over the past few weeks: 
-the first was that really warm Wednesday before the last snow fall - I stopped at a little Korean (I think) produce place in East Goshen to get coffee before dance. As I walked in I noticed a rather plump and slightly unkempt man walking out. I look away from him, but he just stopped and said ""smile little girl"" and when I did, he said ""now, that's better"" and smiled himself. But perhaps what made me smile more, aside from the weather, was the little girl who watched me from the top of the stairs as I poured my coffee and said hello and goodbye in an adorable accent with ten seconds of the other. 

-That Friday was the snow / ice storm - out of school early although the roads weren't too bad then - just wet slush, although I did see an older person skid a little just before turning into Hershey's Mill. Although this is the first winter that I really haven't liked the snow, it is also the first time that I loved spring so much. 

Saturday night my mom and I ventured into the city to see PA ballet do Serenade and Carmina Burana - BBC/BBT went the friday before, but I couldn't go because of the school dance show. Serenade was good, but typical - I mean it was performed for the most part really well. But Carmina's use of the stage lights / set / music / choirs not to mention unique costumes and choereography made it a much more impressive piece."

"event","important / interesting events from the past week:

-last saturday night: coming back from barnes and noble w/ helen, nupur, and bridget - got to king street in malvern when I saw flashing lights of a police car behind me. Strangely I had seen the police car turning around in a parking lot just a ways back - I guess turning around to follow me? Anyway, so I pull over, wait at least five minutes while I completely freak out and scare Nupur / Bridget because it's past curfew. Then the cop, whose a woman, comes up and asks me to pull over into the next street, which scares me more because I think it means that it's something more serious, etc. So she takes an extra five minutes once we pulled off king street and then comes up and quite nicely says that the only reason she's pulled me over is because she thinks one of my headlights is out - I think she may have even used the word ""hun"". So she has me turn on my lights, all the way on, only to realize that they were perfectly fine and after she shines a flashlight in our faces wishes us a good and safe night and drives off. Spanish music. What's ironic is that on wednesday morning when I drove to the cardealership in exton to give my dad a ride because his car was going in for servicing he told me one of my lights was out and that he'd get it fixed because the police can use it as an excuse to pull you over. I hadn't told him about the saturday night experience so I was just like oh really, I had NO idea...

rest of the weekend consisted of rehearsal and stuff - Christina's birthday is the 13th and I still have to go get her a card or something. Unfortunately she didn't come to class on monday because she didn't have a ride, because her mom's away. Monday I missed stretch because of Mr. Great Valley, although I realized that I probably could have gone to at least part of it, which annoys me, because it's a good class and I really need it especially for my right side which a lot tighter than my left - in part because I think I pulled a huge muscle in my thigh. Only three girls showed up for the ballet part of the dance club dance and someone decided to change the schedule on us making us go before formal wear without telling us - so we were in the bathroom changing when we heard our music and only steph and I made it out it in time - well for the second time of our music - because they had to stop and start it again when they realized no one was on stage ready. So the first part was pretty messed up and it resulted in a picture on the website of me in a bad retire back in my pirouette - Nancy always tells us that it should look perfect from every angle and I guess this is one clear proof that I need to work on that - but my turns are improving - and today I managed somewhat poor triples as donna wished. 

tuesday nancy had us partner which was rather intimidating. We started with double pirouettes on pointe supported by the guy - the guy holds your waist and helps push you around. It's easier than alone in a way, which is good because I can't do clean doubles on pointe. But the thing is that all the guys are amazing and I feel so bad when I realize that I am making them look bad / making it more difficult for them because I'm not clean or I'm not holding my weight well - it's one thing to mess up yourself, but it's something totally different to mess up when someone else is depending on. And christy actually talked to me as we stood behind dan freaking ourselves out - it's funny how she's only started being friendly to me now that she knows I'm her age.
 
friday was the dance club show. It was actually turned out a lot better than I thought it would. And although I'm relieved it's all over now, it's sad that this is my last year and all and really as much as we complained we all did have a lot of fun with it. Steph and I were talking after the show and I was asking her what was going to happen next year with dance club. And she asked me what I'd do if there wouldn't be one next year, and I had to reminder that I'm graduating. And then Julie James said that she was forcing me to go to West Chester and take class with her at Brandywine so she'd have ""someone to bitch about"" by which she meant to. It made me realize just how many people I'm really going to miss, and even the people I don't see or like nearly as much as Steph or Julie, both of whom I've gotten closer to this year w/ dance and love."

"event","Things I'd like to do on a more daily basis:
-read / hear the news
-write / read 
-listen to music with knowing who / what is it 
   I recently found some old cds that I've been listening to. Namely, Something Corporate. Awhile ago my computer freaked and I had to delete all my music files, and I switched to internet radios..but now I going back to cds...brings back memories, but whatever, there's not much that doesn't anymore
-work on stamina / stretching / conditioning stuff - I really need to get in shape for this summer. I mean I have some muscle but it is really sad just how little stamina I have, and the other dancers for that matter
But in any case I'm pretty excited for the summer - I think it's the first summer that I actually have a lot already planned for: senior week, CPYB from the end of June through July, PLP probably in august again, probably a family trip to my great aunt's ranch in Texas, and of course college preparing, etc. 

But anyway, I think I'm finally realizing just how fast this year is going by - on a day to day basis it seems rather slow, but really I barely know what happened to winter and really I can't fully believe even that we are seniors and we'll be graduating in only three months. 
And I'd never really thought about it before, but there seems to be a big difference between 17 and 18. The younger girls at dance were talking about my age (it never ceases to amaze this one girl that I'm 17 and I can DRIVE) and one girl mistakenly said I was 18 and another girl who knows I'm 17 looked so unbelievably shocked and really I don't blame her: while 17 is still a teenager there's something marking about 18 - like a definite passing from child to adult. I feel the same way about 19 to 20 - Chris just turned 20 and it seemed so weird to me to think of him as 20 because to me we're still both just kids. It's quite scary, really. 

So, I had my Princeton Interview today. I felt it was sortof weird that I was contacting him through his secretary but he kept saying that my mom (who had answered the first call) had talked to him which she never did. But eh I liked him and I think it's funny that he found in college the same thing that I really want - people. Oh and he works for Charlie Anderson's dad and seems fairly well aquainted with the Anderson family. But I think it went fairly well, even though I managed to slightly crinkle my resume during the car ride over - typical I know - ha, I think it's really quite funny how people just assume I am so neat and organized when really it is so not true. I mean there are times when I get slightly complusive and become momentarially neat, but for the vast majority of the time - no. 


ah - livejournal - I don't know if it's a good thing or not that I'm back and honestly I can't say how consistent the posting will be and sorry but many may be private - I think it's something that I can at least be honest with myself - I never knew it'd hurt so much, but really I think it's better this way and I more than deserve so whatever"

"event","hmm..I think what I like about poetry is it allows me to say such things that I would probably never be comfortable saying to someone's face..its as though its some hidden language in which I can express everything Im thinking, and its nice just to be able to write it down, even if no one will really understand (granted they are rather vague).

this is just well..i don't know a random jumble :

<lj-cut>A sureil world of love..of couples kissing, friends hugging
   places to see...people to be..
But what lies in the truth of it all..the painful lonely truth 
of wishes and hopes and failues..of words unspoken of words regretted..don't you know...it was you all along..I was too afraid to say it to your face..to open the door to talk..to tell you truth..but you wouldn't know..you wouldn't care, you would forget as the door closes washing me out of your life as you wash the dirt wedged under your fingernails..put on the coat, the make-up, wipe you eyes swish your hair stride out the door and into the world..compose yourself for a hard day..the beggars line up beside you..and you walk on don't stop, don't look..head down head straight one foot in front of the other..but its harder now it takes effort to get out of bed to walk out the door..to face the world you roll down the hill hair covered in snow covered in white frost..lying there as misty breath escapes your lips and you shiver and roll and shiver and breath..to think you're alive..just as alive as anyone else-but life is escaping from you today-maybe it will return tomorrow, I do not know weak and unsure you set out to avoid temptation and follow a path..to hack through an untreated forest to seek a flower on the other side..a kingdom of honesty and love a kingdom of sucess a kingdom where they are innocent of jealousy of hate of misunderstanding..where everyone can lived and be loved..Christians call it Heaven..but that I find myself unable to believe in that..and so I left with a corrupted forest we call Earth and myself nothing more than a bacteria to dirty the clean skin of those I touch..innocent they say..little will they..I try I know..but Im already corrupted and it seems no matter what my intentions are not intrepreted..ahhh people will assume things they will regret..why say what you don't know..those who are patient may hear the truth one day, may come to know me one day..not the truth is anything good or special, just ordinary..and well sometimes rather unordinary thoughts about an unordinary world, complaints and fears and pains..nothing you haven't heard before, nothing special..just me. </lj-cut>"

"event","i won't be feeling like myself for the next week or so. i don't know it's thanksgiving break and i want to do something different. so here's a list of things you may or may not know about me, because i don't think people understand me, who i am, what i like, etc. and just assume that i feel a certain way about things. 

Did you know that...
1. I like vanilla.
2. I am completely against illegal music.
3. I thought that some bits of the dance sequences for <i>A Midsummer's Night Dream</i> weren't well rehearsed. But I liked the play.
4. I had a dream about weird escalators and being a student at Penn.
5. My parents do this weird thing where...like...my dad buys a gift for my mom, and then I give it to her and my mom buys a gift for my dad, but then i'm the one who gives it to him. so they buy each other presents, really, but don't give them to each other directly.
6. I am getting my father a cake bowl for christmas.
7. My mom wouldnt let me do governers school because she wants me to ""have fun"" this summer and not do something academic, like dance, and even though I would love to dance, i think I should have been able to do governor's school.
8. If I got to the finals for FBLA, i wouldn't have been able to go to governor's school anyway. what's inconveinent is that now i have to go to guidance and tell them to disregard my teacher recommendations and stuff.
9. (Nupur's making me type this) I told Nupur that ""Me and my husband are going to run away to Alaska. And it'll be so cold there that you won't be able to function.""
10. I think Paddington is handsome for a cat."

"event","hmm..so today was interesting. raining all day..sitting around in chris's dorm with my mom either asking him really stupid questions or just complaining (nothing will change will it)..chris thinking this throw thing my grandmother made for him was actually a rug..eating pistachio nuts...doing ap us work at penn's library and at paul's desk because he left for the day (ha..and having random people thinking I was a Penn student)...hmm...the pod restaurant-it really reminds me of the ""Quantam Cafe"" the absurd wealth of Wharton because all their alumni go become CEOs of some big company and then go and give penn a whole ton of money..seeing penn's athletic center and wharton building go by through the window of a parking garage window..utter confusion at the ticket station in paoli because a bunch of old ladies didn't see the sign that the ticket counter is closed on weekends and keep going on about how the worker was on break and would be coming right back..

anyway...the 20 list thing that I am finally doing
1. I have a love/hate relationship with urban life
2. I love ballet-it is the one thing thats saves me from the stress and chaos my normal life
3. I have some probably impossible and unrealistic dream of going to Cornell and double majoring in biochemistry or something and dance..
4. I prefer white chocolate
5. I wish I was brave enough to really institute change in my life
6. I always find myself jealous...and I hate it so much
7. I love singing, but like writing poetry, its just sortof something I do when I'm depressed and something that justs sortof mine that I would never do any thing else with because Im really not any good
8. I'm a perfectionist
9. I regret almost everything I do/say 
10. Sometimes, just life in general, and just random people amaze me 
11. I wish I could live myself hundreds of times over and each time just have my life go a different way--there are sooo many things I'd like to do with my life and I know I never have the time /courage to do all of them 
12. A lot of my life is governed by irrational fear
13. I can't wait to go to college
14. language in general greatly interests me
15. I think/know/care a lot more than I'll ever say 
16. In some ways I really am quite a careless person
17. My mood changes really quite frequently, but once again its apparently not that apparent
18. Sometimes I get just so tired of the life that I'm living
19. I really wish I had a distinct language/culture
20. I no longer really know who I am"

"event","hmm..meh..the dance: for me at least it was not a good night, and it order to explain sortof what it was like I explain another night that reminds me of this. I had gone to the movies to see Napoleon Dynamite, and this is probably why had I such a negetative opinon of the movie. Not because the movie itself was bad or anything, but because of the events of that night there was no way in which I could have appreciated the sillyness of that movie. I can just remember how it just dragged on and on and how the laughter of the rest of the audience seem to hurt even more. and I can remember the car ride home; it was one of those rides when you're the only car on the road and it was quite dark and you're sitting in the back corner of the car and everyone else is talking, but you just sortof block that out while looking out the window..and for me those rides are always the most depressing and I can remember trying in vain to hold back tears, but ironically noone noticed. Now granted tonight was depressing for a completely different reason and im not going to say exactly why because I'd probably get yelled at for it, but all I'll say is that reason sortof initiated a lot of other things, basically a lot of bad, old memories

I've become to realize that noone really does know me. I mean when the person who I'd say knows me the most thinks that I'm not an emotional person at all, I begin to wonder. But I guess that's sortof what life has done to me; made me keep things to myself, make me hesitant to tell others. As much as I'd like someone to understand me, I think that maybe noone ever will, and yet I have a feeling that there is someone who can just understand me, understand my perspective on life without knowing me that well. 

meh. so auditions were friday. I did alright but I don't think I got in. I mean mrs. leingener doesn't think I'm a good dancer because she's knows that I just started in ninth grade basically,and so she thinks I really don't know what Im doing..which is for the most part true. But even though it would mean a lot to me to get in, I think the fact that I'm taking classes sortof makes it alright. I mean the classes will give me a chance to dance at an advanced level (or at least try for that matter)."

"event","this only really applies to Tishna..
um..i don't know if you want any of this, but I thought I'd put it here just in case. This is just some information about dance schools that I found when I was looking for schools this past summer

hmm..first of all the rock west:
   -website: www.therockschool.org and then under each heading it is broken into the rock west or the rock centre. The website makes it seem like you take a placement class where they just see where you are with experience and where they think they should put you, which means they might end up putting you in a class with younger kids, but because you're probably more serious and dedicated than them you;ll probably move up fairly quickly to classes with people closer to your age (also you could probably ask them from the beginning to put you in a class with students your age, even though you're not at the same level). also, even though tuition here may be expensive, I think they do offer scholarships

and here are just some other schools in case you want to look around or whatever:
-Wayne Ballet: I've heard this was a good school, but I never really looked into it, because it is far away
-The Dance Center (Brandywine School for Performing Arts):                        www.thedancecenter.org-partners directly with the Brandywine Ballet Company; pre-professional school like the rock
-Diane Matthews (www.dianematthewsdance.com); more of a community school, its more laid back and not as serious, although the instruction is still good. also, tuition here is going to be quite a bit less than at the rock or the dance center     

also if you got to AOL yellows pages (if you have aol) and type in your adress and then dance instruction it will give you the distances and average times to all the dance studios within a certain radius. Also you can probably sit in or participate in a class at the Rock to get a feel for the teaching, and the instructors, etc."

"event","soo..on saturday i got my permit..my dad took me to the place and we sat for like an hour, but then i finally got called up. ha and i was right before anna (matsiras) so we were taking our tests right next to one another.
and afterwards my dad took me to the empty..well fairly empty parking lot at immaculta to drive around..and everything went well until he had me park between an actual car and the curb..i was fairly fine getting into the parking space, but when i tried to get back out i forgot to switch from reverse to drive and then well yea..it freaked my dad out especailly because there were actually parked cars behind me and he quickly grabbed for the gear shift..
   and then yesterday he also took me driving and we went to a bunch of different places-the highschool parking lot, a really big corporate center in exton, and some neighborhood..just to let me drive and all.

hmm..our one bathroom that was getting redone is finally done and my mom have moved in..my brother and I really aren't allowed to use it though, until our bathroom (the old one) is getting redone and therefore we'll be forced to use the new one..well actually our bathroom has started to get done-my dad took about half the ceiling out yesterday to reveil the original beams and undersides of the boards of the room above (how it would have been originally)..so now there is only have a ceiling and a lot of dust everywhere despite my and chris's efforts to clean it up.
 and several strange things happened...umm saturday i think..first our water heater broke which means taking really really cold showers..and then my mom couldn't get the grill to start (im not too surprised, because she is rather clueless with stuff like that..but then she went to turn on the toaster and it burst into flames..and yyet she still insists that it is fine and useable.."

"event","So as for California we left last thursday fairly early in the morning. The flight was pretty normal and all, only you had to pay for both lunch and earphones if you wanted. So we got in to the airport at San Francisco on time an dtook the tram to the rental car place..ha and passed the stop for BART-Bay Area Train. And then we waited and waited for a rental car, until we finally got on and left for Napa valley, where the wedding was held. It took us about three hours to drive up, but it was a really nice drive and once we got into Napa Valley the entire countryside was covered with expensive looking houses and wineries and lots of beautiful vineyards..hundreds upon hundreds of straight rows of grapevines.
     So we got to our hotel in Rutherford (in napa valley) and well it was reaallly nice, like the room had a really big bed and fireplace and stainglass window. It was really cool because all of it was done in the style of southwestern architecture..let's just say that we wouldn't have stayed there if we had actually had to pay for it.
     With the time change and all we went to bed early so didn't really do anything until the next day, when we actually went out and did a bit of touristy stuff. We went to Sterling vineyards and took a gondala up the mountain to the winery (the vineyards were at the base of the mountain with the winery at the top) and then we went to the ""Old Faithful"" of California which was a rather pitiful gyser located in the more hickish outskirts of Napa Valley. And somehow it took us almost the whole day to do those two things and drive around and come back in time for the bridal dinner where I got to meet my uh..cousins and second cousins by marriage. 
     The next day I went shopping in Napa with the Liz's (the bride) three daughters, their friend (who had come with them to the wedding) and my cousin. And it became rather apparent just how rich they are..(Liz has barely worked and simply inherited a lot of money. (at least my uncle murray-the groom - who is also quite rich has worked his entire life as an investment banker to become rich)..we went into this one store with lots of really pretty skirts and dresses, but they were all at least eighty dollars, but all her daughters seemed to think that that price wasn't too bad if the skirt was nice, whereas my cousin and I were just like no way with that price.
     As for the actual wedding is was reallly nice. It was held at a private home and vineyard-and the house was practicaly a mansion with a lot of antiques and surrounded on one side by a vineyard and the other by gardens. The cermony itself only lasted for about ten minutes. ha and the ""minister"" was a jewish friend of my uncle and his wife who probably just took some online course to become a ""minister""..but then again it was california so it really didn't matter. After the ceremony all the adults sat down for an elaborate six-course dinner, while us kids sat at a different table and ate more uh normal food..it slightly annoyed me that they seperated us, but seing the maturity of some of my cousins it was very understandable.
       The next day was then the brunch to send the couple off. and then we ourselves left for San Francisco. It took us seven hours to get from napa to the city, because we decided to go west to teh coast and take route 1 south which is very very beautiful but also rather dangerous as it curves up and down the side of mountains. So we finally got into the city and strangely that day was quite like our first one in California.
       As was our second day in the city like the seocnin Napa. In th morning we went down to Fisherman's warf to the aquarium and then to a ferry boat which took us on an hour tour around the bay going under teh golden gate bridge and then around Alcatraz..we decided to not take the boat that would have given us time actually on Alcatrz, because of my mom's bad knees. Then we took a cable car up to uncle and uh..aunt's appartment..which given their financial state was very large and nice and had a really nice view of the financial district and of the bay. From there we went to dinner and then chris and I were finally able to leave my mom at the hotel and go on a real walk aroudn the city...see because of here knees she kept complaining about the hills and all..so Chris and I were able to go to quite far and see some of the great views from the top of the city's hills, as well as lombard street which is this really crooked street on the side of a hill surrounded by gardens
   hmm..the interesting thing about San Francisco is its one of the only cities that I've felt as though I could see myself living in- probably because it is relatively small and clean and felt safe..for some reason I just had a better feeling about it than I do about the other cities I've been to. Another nice thing about the city, or maybe just in the toursit part of the city, but still, I heard a lot of foreign languages, and surprisingly a lot of french
  so sadily we only had one full day in the city and then the next morning we had to be up early to catch our flight and come home arriving in Philadelhpia at 7:30, but not getting baggage and dinner and then home until after 10:00"

"event","hmm..so i saw this movie last night, it was called Whale Rider. It was meant to be a sortof informative film, but it was more of a movie in the sense that it had a complete plot and all..basically it was about a patriarchal religion/society of sorts in New Zealand that was lead by a male cheif. and this tribe (or whatever) believed that their ancestors were the whales that inhabit the waters of the shores on which they live. so basically there the current cheif has come from a long line of cheifs and his son has a child, and of course the grandfather wants the child to be a son, because then they could be the new chief, but of course the child was a girl..and it was there belief that because the line was messed up (with the birth of a girl) their family line went back to that of the ancestors. considering that the girl ""couldn't"" be a chief, the grandfather started a school for all the boys to chose one to be a chief, but they all fail and so he feels as though he has failed and he calls to the ancestors for help..but they don't listen to him..so his granddaughter hearing him call, decides to try calling herself..and they listen to her, and come..literally..meaning that after a few days the beaches are lined with beached whales who all came to the girl's calling ..so the tribe finds the ""leader"" whale and trys to pull it back into the sea, hoping that the others will follow..but they can't and as they walk away, the girl goes and gets on the whale's back urging the whale to live and go back to see and it listens to her and goes back..restoring herself as the cheif of the tribe, even if she's ""only"" a girl..

the interesting thing about the actor who played the girl, was that the producer simply went to area schools and went into all the classes looking (without the children knowing) for the right girl for the part..meaning that the girl she chose had little, if any, actual acting experience and yet did an amazing job..the only thing that kindof annoyed me about this actor is that she mentioned (this was in a ""behind the scences"" thing) that during one emotional scene she had to ""cry"" as she was saying a speach to her neighbors..and apparently they had to switch tapes in the middle of this scene, and because switching them takes so long, she had to basically stand there and ""cry"" in all for about forty mintues..and she said that when she was finally done she had everyone else crying (because she had done such a great job with it ) but that she didn't know why they were and that she was just happy to not have to ""cry"" anymore..which means basically that she never got into that role..that she never actually became that girl..and yes she was only a child herself (although she looked to be about 15) and this was her first role ever, but still.."

anyway..just something i've recently wondered: i don't know but it always amazes me how in our society practically every occupation is filled..from trash man to garbage collector to security guard, painter, taxi driver, school bus driver, worker at Mcdonalds, etc... there are so many necessaryjobs in our society that seem...at least in my opinon..rather unenjoyable..or at least it seems that there would be other jobs that person would much rather have..and yet all of these jobs are filled..and yes there must be a certain amount of distribution-all the positions for this job fill so people may be forced to go to other professions..but still they could move elsewhere or..i don't know but it just seems so amazing..because i mean if not for this our society, as we know it, would collapse"

"event","Well, I have to say that today was a good day. Look at me. Look at the things I've done today involving things online. I changed my icon AND I am updating my LiveJournal.
Something drastic must indeed have happened!

Remember, folks: Gilette - the best a man can get.

I went dancing today, and I had fun. I got to do things involving my legs that Nupur can't do. In fact, Nupur's just plain incapable of dancing, but the things her legs can do in bed...WHOOEE. Impressive if I do say so myself.

I use the word ""whiz"" instead of ""pee."" Did you know that about me? I bet you didn't know that about me. I apparently got it for my mother, wonderful, wonderful woman that she is.
This one time, my mother tried to convince one of my friends that she should worships dogs instead of cows, because dogs are smarter.

I spent a day in a field and the previous night looking at the stars...with an idiot.

Instead of going to the Rock, I might go to Brandywine. This is because Liz Barchi's spoke to my mom about it and said that the Rock's ""been having problems,"" plus I apparently want to go to Brandywine, and I certainly wouldn't mind it. 
I can only imagine what kind of problems...

Nupur's really horny around this time of the month. Probably because she's ovulating. Ovulation is a wonderful act of nature. 

I do a wonderful rendition of <i>Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening.</i> I can't seem to hate snow. There's something inherently beautiful about it, and it makes sense that I own this picture book, even if I hadn't looked at it in...years, probably.

Saffypc: umm..got up read my ap us book while the floor people did the floor and walked in and out looking at me..then i went and played minature golf then when to the driver's license place and got the booklit and then i went to dance..
The people probably kept looking at me because I'm so hot. ;0

And I didn't do too good at minature golf because of the rocks. Grrr...ROCKS. They're placed as to keep me from my inevitable goal.

"event","hmm..let's see a lot has happened to me in the past...week..so this is going to be long

first: florida
let's see so i had my first plane ride..even though it was delayed three hours-we just kindof rolled around the philadelphia airport for three hours without actually going anywhere..and then the pilot told us that the runway was still offically closed for all flights going south but we were the only ones going south (uh..that kindof weird, but..) and so we would just ""deviate"" and see what happens..and it was ok..bumpy, but ok..and the clouds look just so i don't know but so beautiful from above..so just perfect and fluffy..and yes..beautiful..as was the sunset from above.  and also i got this really weird feeling of everything between philadelphia and orlando being nonexistent..i mean i couldn't see any of it and although the plane was moving there was no sense of actually get somewhere because the clouds looked pretty similar..so as we were coming down into orlando i was just like what happen to the carolinas and georgia, etc..
hmm..so mr. boncal (state advisor) was actually waiting for us at the airport..and was actually wearing mickey ears (he is an older bald man, but the mickey ears were surprisingly not that wierd on him)
so the competition started with the opening session and pa's and california's noise sticks (and it just happens that we were the only two states with them and we are the two big rivals at nationals)..and as it turns out a got 8th...nothing in comparison's to chris 1st, but ok i guess..my grandmother was going on about how i did so poorly because i was upset about my grandfather..which i wasn't..the only reason was because there were a few really weird questions that weren't covered in my book and i guess i just guessed wrong on those

hmm..so as for disney itself i just saw epcot and animal kingdom..epcot was cool with all the countries and stuff, but animal kingdom got kindof boring..but the one thing that really got to me about disney was how amazing fake happy it was..i mean they had to have signs saying the happies celebration on earth like every five feet and happy music audible from everywhere

second big event in the past week: my grandfather's funeral: it was sad yes, but i think sucessfully the ""celebration of life"" he wanted it to be..see he had made meticulous plans for the funeral leaving only the last hymn to the pastor..and the one thing that stood out to me from the whole service was  completely secular (despite the intense religous sense of the rest of the service) and talked about being in peace with the world and with yourself..throughout his whole life my grandfather had been in peace with others through all of his numerous volunteer and community service activities to attain equal rights and give equal chances to the minorities and poor of the city..and yet it was only late in his life that the pastor was able to truly notice that he had found a peace with himself ..he used this example: my grandfather came into church one sunday wearing a bright orange shirt (and now granted he was always rather reserved) and asked tim (the pastor) if he liked the shirt and noted that he would never again wear a tie to church ..and he wore that shirt again the next night to the moschola from which he would leave in an ambulance..and i think these two things..peace with oneself and peace with others was shown very clearly when my grandfather's told my grandmother with his last words that he loved her...first that he had the peace with himself to break from his emotional solitude and second that he had come to a peace with his wife and was able to tell her that

and then there was the after reception..i felt so bad for my grandmother because she had to stand there for like two and a half hours and listen to people telling her how sorry they were. etc. etc..well after all she is very social but still..hmm..and i saw my godmother for the first time in like ten years, as well as the person who practically rasied my mother-their housekeeper when she was little
so my grandmother wanted the family to have dinner at her house, but there was like four hours before dinner time so chris and i went out and explored and just wandered around center city for a good three hours


third: my first dance class was tonight.it went well and i knew basically everything from dance 1-which made the class a lot less intimidating..not to mention that no one seemed to care about correct attire or hair, etc..is was rather casual, but in a good way i guess..the teacher wanted to move me up to the next level saying my posture and esp. my feet were good and that i knew most of the matieral in this level..however, there were a few things i wouldn't know if she moved me up...but anyway it will be good to just become more sure with the ""basics""


ok..that is finally everything..and now that nationals are over i can finally not have that pressure on me and can really relax and do stuff like go to vicky's pool gatherings (it was los of fun yesterday, but hopefully next week more people can come) and just read a book (nupur (ha..i actually used your name..) i am coming along in Doctors and im still liking it"

ok.as for my summer.

hm.my grandfather: he passed away this morning..for the past few days he has had a lot of trouble breathing and with the feeding tube..in all it is quite a blessing..i mean he's been in a coma for over a week and it was almost more than time to go. also he never woke up and didn't feel any pain through the whole thing.

and also i went to the dentist..on the same day as helen..and the weird thing about it is that my dentist was my dad's college roommate..so after having the whole checkup thing we went out to lunch..with the dentist.it was kindof awkward but not that bad actually

other than that i've been kept pretty busy with international business (fbla nationals)..reading and taking notes on the testbook all over again.
i leave in two days..and get to ride a plane for the first time! that should be interesting.."

"event","for those of you who don't know my grandfather is sick, by which i mean he is in a coma with life support-he choked on a piece of food when they had gone out to dinner and then some of it got into his lungs and then somehow one of his lungs got a hole in it so the doctors decided to complete an emergency surgery to try to fix the hole, but he fell into a coma...and i guess i kindof thought that'd he might get better or least wake up from the coma..but i mentioned that to my mom today and she all she said was no, no he wouldn't, he just wouldn't, it'd would be a miracle if he did and its just not possible..i guess that just made it real for me for the first time, but in a sense it is almost good he wouldn't wake up..he never wanted to be in this state, not only because he didn't want himself to be in that state which one can hardly consider living, but because he didn't want my grandmother and the rest of his family to have to go through that...my grandmother and great aunt have been going into the hospital every day and just sitting there talking to him...not that he can hear them or understand what they are saying (even though the doctors told him he could-for their sakes)... he has a signed living will saying he doesn't want emergency surgeries or life support..and i guess when they completed the emergency surgery they thought the odds were better and now it is kindof hard for the doctors to just take him off the life support.."

"event","although many people thought of the awards assembly as a waste of time, i am glad that  i went..and not because of the senior prank or even really because of the rewards chris won, but more just to honor mr. whitelock..even if i was just one person clapping in the whole audience of people..i will miss him so much and next year and fbla just can't be the same with mr. widhson...i mean i am sure that he will be an adequate advisor and that he'll do an ok job next year, considering it will be his first year, but there is no way that he can fill the shoes of mr. whitelock, just no possible way...and i'm sure mr. whitelock will still be around to answer questions and possibly help run fbla from the outside, but it can't be the same
and its weird to think that i'll be with him almost to the last day of his teaching career (it ends offically june 30th and nationals end the 28 or 29) and i just hope that that's how he wants to end his career..i mean he told me that he had asked mr. widhson to take me, but that he already had plans so that mr. whitelock kindof had to take me..

anyway...victoria's party was fun..and happy early birthday to you!"

"event","latin class:

there is so much about this class that I wouldn't miss, but in a way i'll miss the small talk..i mean there is probably more diversity in that class than in any other that i've ever been in..a lot of the kids are not very smart at all (i mean for the most part they failed out of level two or three of another language)..but, still it is very interesting what we discuss..for example one kid asked the whole why can't everyone just learn english typical question, and we went off one a little side about it..my eacher for some reason went with the story from the bible (even though she normally gets all skiddish about even mentioning religon in class), and then went on to say that scientists would never believe the bible story...which says that God made men learn different languages as a punishment so that they could not communicate to build this tower to heaven that they had tried to..personally i think different languages is if anything a gift, an attribute to mankind; it gives us the diversity and culture that i think we all look for at some time in our life, it makes us unique and special in our own language, and respectful of others when learning and eventually beginning to master another's language

also, once one kid was just randomly mentioning that he was thinking about how if there is no afterlife than your body id just there forever..it really amazes me how it has taken this long for people to begin to doubt in God and their ideas of an afterlife..i am not saying that they are stupid, it is just the way they were raised..i mean i was also raised to elieve that death was just that foreverness without thought or anything and that we don't go anywhere. and then some people are just raised to believe in and afterlife, so that it takes time and almost rebellion from that obedience of thought for other possibilities to sink in


anyway..i spent some time this afternoon to look at the artwork finally in the library hallway lobby thing (i could not take the test i was supposed to because the writing center was closed)..and i spent some time just looking through all pictures..my parents must have had a camera with them like all th time becuase there are a lot of random pictures of just about everything"

"event","hmmm...lets see
emilyn and i finished our dance thing for class yesterday..so i went to her house on the bus, and realized it was also vicky's bus..oh and i really love emilyn's house, not just becuase it looks really cool and i like the tree surroundment and everything, but because there is a natury relaxed atmosphere about it..i don't know it kinda reminds me of my grandmother's house in the poconos and i've always associated a rather positive attitude with that house, soo....

as for today i saw that dance show thing. i liked it, for its uniqueness and because the dancers were reeeeallly good. meh, but it realy annoyed me how a lot of people were either rude during the actual performance or making fun of it later...i don't mind if they don't like it or are unable to appreciate it, but it annoys me when people who don't even understand it try to make fun of it; its not how tight the costumes are or how gay the guy dancers look or even how silly some of the moves may look to a rather immature audience, but the movements the dancers are completing and the feelings and ideas that they are trying to convey through that movement..that is why i really love dance i guess, it is completely nonverbal and yet can be extremely effective...and i also love how dance can just make me feel so much better when i've had a depressing day-like today i just came home and randomly danced around the house for a hour and it felt really good..

"event","well, first of all the fbla conference was lots of fun..i am going to miss seven springs resorts-we had a room with a blacony on the seventh floor overlooking one side of a ski mountain, and it amazed me how even though it was half covered with what normally would be old gray ugly snow it managed to be amazingly beautiful all the same...especially at night or early in the morning when there was no one out there to make any noise and it was just so quite and peaceful
one interesting thing about the doors to the balcony was that the molding wasn't exactly on very well..three random guys came into dave's. don's, and keith's room and went out onto the balcony. so dave closes the door between the balcony and the room and slides across that little metal chain latch...and the guy just rams into the door and pulls the molding off-and about five mintues early he had made the comment that he had done the exact same thing a few years ago...
as for the actual test i got second which means i get to go to orlando for nationals..it was really quite amazing because i wasn't that sure of how i did on the test 


and for those of you who don't know i didn't get into honors english..i mean i guess i could go talk to someone about it, but i don't think i really have ms. kimbol's support, and i think you basically need your teacher to override the exam. the other good thing is that it will give me more time to concentrate on the subjects i am more serious in- math and chem, but i hope that whichever teacher i have they will give me the oppurtunity to develop my writings skills  as i would have the chance to have done in honors, because i feel as though being in the lower class will pull done my oppurtunies.."

hmm..you can always tell when the end of the marking period is coming...in enlgish mrs. kimbol had gotten rather lazy and decided to show us two movies in one week-first of mice and men..and then scrooged because we have been doing poetry which includes learning about parodys...well see she never grades stuff until the last minute at the end of the marking period she'll just give us some work or ..put on a movie...

oh..and there will be a solar eclipse tommorrow..sortof..basically it will be in totality some where over the ocean in the caribbean area...and there is about a two to zero percent totality in our area, which means that two percent of the sun will be blocked out..like a little little chunk...no fun...i wish i could just liek fly down to that region and see it because it's sounds so freaky and cool-like it just gets dark in the middle of the day and all you see of the sun is the outlined corona.

"event","hmm..so last night was this surprise party we did for kelsey and julie...it went ok, i think (hope) they had fun...it was so weird for me though because i am kindof fading away from being friends with some of them..not necessarily because i want to , i don;t really know why, but just because..so just being with them made me kindof depressed and jealous (i hate myself so much for being jealous). but i wouldn't talk about that because i think she happy, so i should just suck it up myself and be happy for her- sry, that probably didn't make much sense to any of you, but..

anyway..it was interesting to see just how different they are in comparison to say like those at vicky's party..at vicky's we talked for like five hours-which i loved btw., by with the people at the party last night, i honestly don't think they could or would have had such a conversation-it was as though just sitting around and talking wasn't good enough-all night, heather had to make us keep doing something like playing this game or that, doing this or that...i not saying that there is anything wrong with that if it's fun, but it was just interesting for me to see two completely different types of people

secondly, it has always been interesting for me to see heather's little three year old brother-i hate how she is so impatient with him, but anyway its like the first time i have interacted with a child that young and it really is quite interesting to me...i feel bad for him because it is hard for people to understand what he says so he gets very fustrated. but also he says things sometimes that i never thought was capable of someone his age-he has an ability just to sense what someone is feeling-on a basic level and also there is so social barrier yet that has really taught him what he should and shouldn't say-he just says what he thinks and wants to..if he doesn't want to say something than he says no, and if he wants to he'll try to get his way so that he can..."

"event","<lj-cut>  i honestly don't think i have ever seen my mom so mad..or hurt or whatever it was..but it was scary
basically while my brother was in europe, she redid his room-new rug, chair, new wall hanging and she went through all his stuff and threw out the stuff that she didn't think was important..(like his dictionary, which he says is basically his best-friend)...so he came home today and got really mad and upset that she had thrown all his stuff out and redone his room, without his permission..she the got affended back getting mad becuase he never wanted anything from her..and all..and my brother tried to get her to understand that it wasn't because she had done it, but because she hadn't asked for his permission..so she admitted that she did for herself and shouldn't he be happy that she'd done something for herself, because its good for her to do that...and of course he answers yes, but she did it without thinking about him and what he would want which made her really defensive..for some reason although she has always encouraged us to be trueful, she thought that he should have appreciated her doing all this work ""for him"" and have just lived with it if he didn't like it...but he was just coming back from ten days away from home and all he wanted was to relax in his room and be able to work, but he couldn't find anything and it felt ""just like another hotel room""..
my mom took a picture that she had frammed of me and her for him to take to college to remember us and slammed it on the floor, becuase he ""didn't want anything from her"" i mean it wasn't as though he was trying to be mean, he was hurt that she wouldn't respect his privacy and ask him... whenever my mom mentioned to someone that she was doing this, they would tell her that if they did that to their son he'd be mad if he didn;t have a say in it...and she just said oh no he'll love it, and anyway if he doesn't he has only has six months living here..she just has to do everything for herself, and i am proud of my brother or standing up to her and trying to make her respect him, but it completely backfired-not only is she extremely mad at him, but she punished him (as though he needs to be punished, because he was ""so bad"") in a really cruel way..penn housing forms come this friday, and my brother wants to house in one of the high rises-appartment like dorms with paul, but now my mom is refusing him to do so and saying he has a chose of king's court or hill, becuase she doesn't like the highrises..so bascially he has to live where he doesn't want to and he can't room with paul, becuase paul is pretty set on the highrises, and is not going to change just because my mom wouldn't let chris go with him..which basically has completely depressed chris because he thinks this will completely screw up his college life
he thought that by going to college he would get away from my mom and all-as he said he wants to erase the first eighteen years of his life before graduation-but now she still manages to ruin his life, not to mention that he found out today that he wasn't accepted for this german abroad program that he had applied for where he would have been able to spend a month in germany this summer for minimal costs-he got accepted as an alternative, but considering that the applicants are expeced to go unless they get really really sick, therefore there is practically no chance of him going, which just further depressed him, becuase he really really cared out this program and really doesn't want to have to spend the summer here..im glad that he gets to leave next year, not that i want to see him go, but because he really really can't stand it here and can't stand my mom and wants to just get out and be free from all of it...but now she is ruining his experience there..i mean maybe she'll calm down in a few days and be more rational, but i really doubt it, seeing as she was pretty against the highrises to begin with, but now...and it not that i mean to completely paint her as the villian, because i think it really upset her that my brother insulted her decorating, or just the idea of doing it, but she was so selfish about it and irrational that i can't help but pity by brother who did nothing but tell the truth, and nothing i don't think practically anyone else wouldn't have done in the situation,. i don't know i am just worried about both and them and i hope they will come to understnad one another, but i really don't think it can happen, so i guess i just hope that my brother can surive these next six months and go to college without his college years and the rest of his life be messed up, becuase of her-he has so much potential and so much life ahead and she's done enough damage to him as it is and it is not fair of her to do any more, even if she didn't mean to, she just has to think about others for once

...sorry for ranting on and on, is just i really needed to just write it down and all-its the first time in a really long time that i've seen both of them so upset, especailly my brother </lj-cut>"

"event","i was reading the wife of bath's tale..from the Canterbury Tales (I am doing a speech on Chaucer for english with critical analysis on this poem)..so basically a knight rapes a maiden and the queen says that he shall have a year and a day to  find the answer to the question what to women want most..she he finally finds out from an old had who says that women want dominance in a marriage..and the queen agrees..
personally i don't agree with this..i mean all i really want from marriage is trust and commitement, and someone who really wants it back and is willing to have it last a lifetime...i watched a movie last night that put it really nicely, (the plot was lacking, but it was a cute movie)..the wife of the main character was answering the question why do people get married and she said that it is because you want to feel special..that out of the nine billion people on this planet there is that one person who is there for you always, that one person who comes home everyday, one person to whom you are special, even if the rest of world doesn't care about your life..idealistic view maybe, but a beautiful outlook on"

   -fallen trees and branches all over the place because of this ice storm they had up there
   -feeling very isolated on friday because we were only one of a few people there..but more came on sunday
   - countingthe occupied camps by the number that had smoke coming out of the chimney
  - driving past all the camps and seeing the ominous red freeze light through the window
  -trying the light a fire, but having the smoke come into the camp and setting of the fire alarm, because when we thought the damper was open, it really wasn't
  -""who wants to try not to fall into the icy cold water first?""
  -trusting two ice patches to take my weight and falling in getting my foot all wet
  -trying to follow the powerline trail to our camp, but ending up at the toby
  -slipping on ice patches twice in a row
  -trying and failing to find the sandpit..we didn't go far enough
  -our dog crying whenever my brother was driving
  -trying to follow a trial, but almost getting lost a number of times, because a lot of the markers were either worn away or on trees that had een knocked down
   -seeing people ice fishing or something in the middle of the lake, but my mom not letting us go out on it..
   -not having any running water, even though the person at the office told us that all the camps had water..
   -playing global pursuit and beating both my mom and brother..as chris said it is practice for academic challenge next yr.
   -watching fast runner on chris's ibook..it is an interesting movie considering that it tells the lives of the inuits..but it gets rather long and repetitive, but then again a guess that's what their lives are..my mom saing that they better have paid the actor well that had to run across the ice naked..some other inuits had atacked his tent and forced him to run away across the ic, befre he was able to get dressed..
  -i think our furnace is trying to die....""nooo..""/...it was 12 degress friday night

we unfortuanately came home early , because my mom wanted to miss the storm, and not get stuck...it would have been so cool to have seen the lake and toby in an ice/snow storm..."

"event","nothing much new besides the eagles losing..i actually watched the game because it was my brother's birthday and so we went out to dinner and they had a tv there...

as for today...

latin: some of the kids have found out what math im in, because we had a study yesterday, becuase whenever we have a sub they can never find the stuff and so we jsut have a study hall....so it was like me opne my math book..this other kid looks at..him ""what math are you?""..me: ""precalc""..him ""omg!..i'm only in alegbra 2 (and he's a junior)...him: wait...that means you'll be in like the super high one next year.."" me: ""bc calc?""...him ""omg..""...
math: i came late bc of fbla photo just in time o turn around and level..for ice skating with the life skills kids..it was fun, but i felt bad for the person i was helping..she wasn't very good and got scared and fell a few times and then was more scared and was clinging on to me...

the trial in history: persecuting went and they weren't that good, but in all fiarness to them it must be hard o attack something that you know is false..i mean everyone basically toda know sthat the sun is the center of the universe, but people during galileo's time people actually thought and truly believed that the universe was geocentric..not that they were stupid or anything, just that they had believed for centuries and centrueis that the earth was the center so for some men to come along and suddenly claim that the bible was wrng and the sun was the center would be hard to just believe....

chem: i think that mrs. falcone is quite tolerable as a teacher..she does expect us to learn a lot on our own in the book, but it is a high-elvel and we should be expected to do that, and i don't think we will be preared for the final..we are only on chapter 7 and need to finish the entire book by then..but i don't think she is as bad as a loot of people claim..i think they just blaim their bad grades on her teaching ability, when it is actually just a show of their effort..also chem is difficult and some people seem to think that if they get a c in a class that they would normally get a b in it is suddenly the teacher fault, not a measure of the difficulty of the course..also they could in complaining that they studided three hours for a test and they still got a c on it..first of three hours is not that much and second studying will only help if you understand the material, which is more difficult and is a large par tof chemistry

i actually got to go to adgio because dance was canceled..it was interesting and i think the dicussiong was more productive than it has been in the past.."

fbla this morning: we are finally doing something productive for the tsunamia victims and selling relief bracelets...soo if anyone wants one i have some

latin: we had these grade conferences and my teacher was all like you must be doing something really special when you study, because it showing...it is really just my french background that enables me to do well without puting having to study as moree as i would..they really are quite similar in terms of gramar and vocabulary...after all french originated from latin...

la: we went to the audion and had this weird activiy with a poet from philadelphia..she would play us music and have us write our thoughts down and then share them...by principle it is not a bad idea, but it annoyed me that a lot of the responses came out as rap when the music did not really lend itself that well to rap..then again about half of the people there were african american....it was kindof odd, because then i went to this dance class with an outside dance company 9th and 10th and the same group of black people were there again..the class was ok, but was interrupted by people who wre not serious and would laugh and talk to each instead of listen and do the exercises..

what one of the songs did inspire me to write..and what i have expanded on:

darkness surrounds, encases, engulfs
lost in pain no light to lead the way
time flys by, but there is no clock 
it does not matter
does anything
our human pursuit is selfish happiness
but how can i find it when i am so lost
no one will help me lost in themselves
must it be this way?
i try to fight against instinct and love for the sake of love
but i open empty hearts and minds
seeing nothing, finding nothing
leaving with empty hand and empty heart
is humanity so cruel as to forget love
so ignorant to not see, to not understand
the simpilicty of ourselves intertwined in external complexity
we all live for the same desire
and die in the same defeat
those who have sought for good have failed
and those who have forgotten good, have died as cruel as they always were
we do not change
history tells a tale, gives hed of danger, 
but it lands on empty ears, empty hearts, empty minds
full of complex thought, but empty inside
that beautiful simplicity that is our basic soul is lost
has been forgotten and discarded
left by the wayside of modern life
no longer ""important""
no longer necessary



the trial for history should be fun, and it is interesting how all the roles seem to fit their actors...it is interesting that she is giving us the whole week to prepare when we only probably need two or three days

and we have finally started to learn the mole in chem..it certianly took long enough...but i guess it would be easier to understand it now thatn at the beginning of the year. in fact i don't think it is really possible to understand a number so large..i mean ur brains can't even really comprehendre soe as large as a billion let something millions of times larger and to think that that is how much make up one mole, only one mole of a substance whichin reality is nothing at all in comparison to the unvierse, which is equally to large to comprehendre..the thing that is interesting about it though it that if our earth is so unique and that we evolved so much by cahnce then what are the possiblities for othercreatures or planets or starts or other objects that could exist. it is kindof annoying that our astronomers have spent so much time on trying to find earth lke being which is a trival prusuit, becuase even if we can find them communiction would be practically impossible, and if we evolved by chance than it is even more impossible that something else also evolved by chance, but by the exact same chance..and one difference in evolution coudld create a completely different and uncompatible being...yet it is more comforting to search for what we know and are used to than the what we don;t know, which is so much more... and yet is some ways much more interesting..also the problem know is that scientist have little funding from the state for the most part and thus can only afford to research what the state will pay for..it seem sstupid that the government should control the field of science, inparticulr which it knows relatively liitle about and may not understnad the implimentations it may have..if we look at the scientific revolution for example the chrch, which was in some cases practically the state, denied that teaching of the glileo and other spporters of the coperinican theory..to them it was wrong and not worth studying..in fact worht denying..however, the discoveries of those such as galileo and the mathematical work of Copernicus was so influentical as to change the tide and meanign of life..what is to say that we can';t discover something in the heavnes aor in our own worl that will do that same..and why should such possiblites be limited, when the states want to take the money and use it for something as trival as war..history shows that interna strife ruins a country, and on a larger scale internal strife in the world, such as war, could destory us and in many ways already has."

"event","MUN....:
random moments from the weekend:
-the fir alarm going off and all of the gv people just standing around with the maids while everyone rushes downstairs..until erin goes to the window and it like ""omg ther;s thousand of people in the streets"" so we all run downstairs only to come back up a minute later
-rex's pizza...cheap and not to bad and very close to the hotel
-snl...
-Fiona and Ksenia sleeping in our room because anya kicked them out...because she had a guy in there...
-the chaperones always being late or missing
-penn tour in the freezing cold...and then we all ditched the tour guide to go to the warmth of the penn bookstore
-calling ms. barben
-the elevators almost never stopping on our floor
-kidnapping a delegate from a another committee who had orignially been in our committee
-""motion to leave?""
-ilmunc silly putty
-who's that old man?...our bus driver..
-apparently argenita and south africa were the same delegate
-all brown people are related?
-our 3 clause resultion..that was passed by our committee..

-as for my actual committee:
at first i didn't really know what the rules were the motions, etcs, but by the second topic i understood and was able to participate more; i worked with swaziland on some clauses for their working paper and they only had me as a signitary, but whatever..
-there were only 36 nations which made it easier to talk  and interact and we actually got through two topics even though we were really slow on the first one
-all of the major countries..US, UK, canada, India, China,etc. and others like Venezula and swaziland hasd really good delegates...one had the kyoto protcol basically memorizzed, but he still had a copy on hand just in case
-a lot of them also go to four or five conferences a year, whereas we only go to one.
-there were only one or two delegations that were not at all dedicated and would leave an hour early and never tlaked or intereacted with the working papers, or anything else...i don;t really understand why they went other than to get out of school or something..beacuse they had not interest whatsoever to the committee debates...it was the same for like liv bene and britteny g...they apparently never tlaked and never went to the GA pren. but istead went to ecosoc and just never left..

but in all it was a good experience to work with other very creative, innovative and intelligent people who were dedicated as though it was the actual UN not just a model UN"

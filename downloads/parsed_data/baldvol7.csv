"event","i know that i haven't updated this thing in forever, but i've been busy. just a quick update...i have officially been the co-creator of two new games: RecBall and Death Ball. you want to know more? just ask. life is going great here. i miss home, but the pain is eased slightly only due to the fact that if i'm not working, then i'm with rach. if i'm not with her, then i'm either with tim or i'm asleep. pretty good and easy life that i've got here. things are just good feelin' right now. exhaustion has become a good friend of mine, but sleep is an even better. i've learned many things so far. i'll just share a few...1) when life is just too much to handle, hold on for one more day. it always gets better. (i actually learned that on december 3, but it's still a lesson). 2) golf balls, when travelling at an excess of 100 mph off of a brick wall tingle ever so slightly when they make solid contact with a calf muscle. (thank you Death Ball). and 3) no matter how bad your life is for the moment, there is always that knowledge that there is a God above who will come through for you in a pinch. what a great and mighty God I serve. well, i hope to keep this updated. if i don't type in this for a while...tomorrow (thursday, june 17) rach and i will have been dating for exactly 6 months. at this point, i just can't imagine life without her. i look back at the time before i met her (note lesson 1, i met her on her birthday which was dec 3 *wednesday*), and realize how different i am emotionally. i've learned, along with her help, that there is a tomorrow. and when things go wrong, we just have to wait for the sun to rise and for us to start again. there is always another ray to shine on us and to light the way. i love you rach. i miss all you guys from g-town and from ut. the fall is not that far away. until then, PEACE OUT!"

"event","well, freshman year is finally over. it's had its ups and downs, but it all worked out in the end. as i write this, i now sit at my computer at HOME! how awesome is that?! granted, i already miss you guys from ut, but it's only a couple of months. and then the insanity can continue. but for now, i'm gonna enjoy my family and the summer. and by enjoying the summer, i mean that i am gonna work like a D-O-G! hope all is going great and i shall see all of you soon. GO VOLS AND NEW LIFE!"

"event","summer time is coming fast and it's time for a little packing and stuff. the beds are debunked and classes are done. i have one final, not including the final paper about how reality tv has warped today's society. but instead of studying, i have caught myself remembering the past year. i think back to the fall and realize how much i've grown (not physically). through frustration and fun, heartache and love, i have become one happy person. i've learned so much. and most of it had nothing to do with classes. i'm not gonna go into detail, but one bit of advice for you: don't eat ice from a cooler that is labeled not for human consumption. this ice is used to store dangerous chemicals and may make you sick. i've learned that a story is never complete without pain and resolution. my story, so far has both, but is nowhere near completion. i love life, even the curveballs that it throws at me. may 29 is fast approaching and i can already hear the first few lines of free bird. well, it's time to enjoy life instead of typing in this thing. all, have a great one!!!!!!!!"

"event","oh, man. i can't believe it's been a week since i did this thing. i feel bad for not typing and staying up to date. well, let me catch up real quick. last week was pretty hectic. i had an ear infection, my last geo lab (exam is this week), and i did the lesson on wednesday night. thursday was my last full day with rach and then she was off to another country. i miss her so much. for those out there doing the long distance relationship thing, you guys are much stronger than i. i almost lost my mind being away from rachel for 5 days. one thing that made it easier though is i got to see my family. it was awesome to sleep in my bed, to eat my mother's (and father's) cooking. the chicken on the grill and the hotdogs are definitely the best i've had in a long time. i've discovered, though, that as much as i know i'm supposed to be here, it's hard not to think about what life would be like if i were there. i mean, i wouldn't have met rach, but i think that we would've met anyway.that's one of the many things i have going for me here, but i still don't have my mom, sister, and dad (in no particular order, by the way).i got to spend some great time with everyone of them this weekend. my mom and i played a game called fowl words almost the entire weekend. my dad and i got to watch a dvd of a lynard skynard concert that he was at. i actually saw him a bunch of times. i can't wait for the concert on the 29th. if you get a chance (and like skynard) download Red, White, and Blue. it's one of those that you might not like at first, but it grows on you everytime you hear it. i didn't get a lot of time with andrea (or dre as tim calls her) because she was at tnt. but what time i did get was awesome. i miss all of you and can't wait to see you again. just try not to make it so hard to leave this time. i don't know, set some of my clothes on fire or something like that. rach gets home tonight and maybe i'll fell less lonely then, but until then...psychology is calling and i must answer or i will fail that class (stupid psych teacher)."

"event","i've waited to update this on purpose. i wanted to wait until after the easter holiday. if you would have asked me how my easter was gonna go earlier last week, i would have said that it would be fine, but that i would miss my family so much that it would put a damper on the weekend. man, would i have been wrong. this weekend will go down as one of the best ever! it started on thursday, rachel and i went to the pool to bask in the sun. it was great except i had to go to work for an evaluation. it went really well, though. yeah, that means i get to keep my job! how awesome is that? anyways, after that, she and i went to a literature reading, and that was the bomb-diggity also. on friday, we went to the zoo. and although my mother says differently, i still don't think that i've ever been to the zoo until this past friday. it was, indeed, a good friday. after the zoo (by the way, at the zoo we met a proud lama and a goat tried to eat me) we went to oak ridge and spent the rest of the evening there with one of the greatest families ever, the HETTICHs! we just chilled out and watched some bill cosby (thanks ED). around 10ish, i left their house and came back to campus (sans rachel, but that was okay because she was with her family). when i got back, i got an awesome parking place and me and andrew chilled. thanks dude. our talk really helped. saturday, i was privileged enough to spend it again with the hettichs. i got to mow their yard. (you don't know how much you will miss it until you actually go without it. thanks dad, you've warped me into a grass-cutting fiend) after mowing, bob and i had the match of the century in tennis. and then it was on to softball practice. man, is this gonna be fun this year. easter, although spent away from my family, wasn't that much of a drag. the hettichs (have i mentioned how much i love them) allowed me to not only spend the day with them, but allowed me to sleep the night before at their house. i was kinda bummed that morning because this is the first easter that i've gone without seeing my mother. this is also the first year that i didn't get a new easter shirt. i was really sad when i woke up. my day would soon get better. first off, the first two people i saw were rachel and hobo(their dog). that alone would've made the day great, but i had forgotten that i was in the house of the most selfless family on the planet. when i got down to the breakfast table, marcie had an easter basket for me. chock full of moonpies, cherry limeade, cherry coke, reese's peanut butter cup, and other goodies guaranteed to rot my teeth and brain. thanks marcie! we went to church and met gollum. if you want to know more, just ask. after that, we ate the greatest ham in the world and then chilled and did the nazarene nap thing. it was one of the best weekends ever. all topped off with just a simple homework thing for french and then hanging with rachel until bedtime. one mystery remains...where's my roomate? one last thing. when it is hard to think about growing up and leaving behind my childhood, there is that one person who i think about and feel like it is ok to grow up a little. i love you rachel hettich!"

"event","life is seems to be getting better now that i've come to grips with the fact that my parents aren't coming this weekend. and besides, i'm going to see them in a week from tomorrow anyway. thanks to jared for finding out why my car's check engine light came on. i told you dad that it had nothing to actually do with my car being messed up. anyways, speaking of my dad, i found out that on may 29 (saturday night) my dad and i are going to see one of the greatest all-time bands live. that's right, lynard skynard...LIVE! (FREEBIRD) oh, man, it's gonna rock my face off. i think that i am rejuvenated so much on thursdays for many reasons. 1)church the night before always seems to lift me up a little(even though last night's service was a bum service) 2) i know that i've only got two more days (well, this week i only have one) until the weekend. 3)i have the best friends in the world. 4)and...i have the best girlfriend that has ever existed. sorry annalise, but i still have the best significant other (yeah, i love you brad, but you...well...you're a guy...a very nice guy...but a guy nevertheless. and by the way, my knee still hurts from the racquetball) oh, man! life is great when i sit back and think about all of my friends here at ut and back home. i'm gonna miss everyone this summer. well, not rach or tim since i'll still be here, but the rest of yous guys, i'm gonna miss. anyway, i don't think my boss would be too pleased if he knew that i was doing this journal at work. by the way, i think everyone should get up at 5 in the morning sometime. and see if at the end of the day, you don't feel like you've accomplished something great. ok, well, i'm gonna go study for my exam in the rock licking class for a while. oh, and if you see rachel or andrew, ask them about kicking the wall and molesting cows. you might get a cool answer, or...you might not. peace out!"

"event","i don't know what the deal was yesterday with the posting on yesterday. thanks to andrew and rach and annalise for what they said. also, thanks to tim. you've been a rock for me since i got in college and i don't know what i'd be up to right now had you not been there. ah, 7:05 am. most people are still nestled peacefully in their beds. no, not me. i've been at work for just shy of 2 hours and it feels good. after a day like yesterday, it's sometimes good to wake up, walk in the cold, and just get alone for a while. today is a long day, but at the end, i'll feel much better. one last thing, for those of you who don't understand the value of a smile. just ask me how much better one smile made me feel yesterday. call me a sap, but there is nothing better than having a bad day, and then seeing that one special someone smile and tell you that everything will get better. thank rach!"

"event","Well, it seems that everyone else has one of these and it seems like a good idea to try it out. Maybe i will be able to relax more by trying this out. well, here goes. i hate to do this, but i'm gonna complain in my first entry. easter is coming up (which is good) but i don't get to see my family. i have to be here without them. an upside is that i get to possibly be with rachel. she is the one thing that has kept me sane through this crap with my family. they say that they are coming to see me, and then they bail. now who's acting less responsible? oh, well. this week will get better, i can feel it. i always get more energized at this point in the year. just thinking about what jesus did for all of us just makes it easier to believe that things will get better even though they seem pretty drab at the time. i miss home, but home is where the heart is. where is my heart at this moment? is it with rachel, or is it with my family in g-town. i don't know, but i hope to find out soon. this is tearing me up inside. well, now that i've been a complete sad person (yay for vocabulary) i'm gonna go. peace out!"

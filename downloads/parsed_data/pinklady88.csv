> The sirens screamed out eulogies,

> For death was in the air.

> A mother, trapped inside her car,

> ""Oh, God, please spare my boys!""

> Two children's seats crushed in.

> Her twins were nowhere to be seen;

""I Can""

[Kids]
I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Nas]
Be, B-Boys and girls, listen up 
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress 
But nothing comes easy it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person
Got her strung on that
Heroin, cocaine, sniffin up drugs all in her nose...
Coulda died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath
Cause she smells of corrosion and death 
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how,
Put your hands in the air, and take a vow

[Chorus - 2x (Nas and Kids)]
I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Nas]
Be, B-Boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey 
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be 
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

[Chorus]

[Nas]
Be, be, 'fore we came to this country 
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush 
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold when 
Gold was converted to money it all changed 
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded 
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships 
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went 
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically 
Still goes on today, you see? 
If the truth is told, the youth can grow 
Then learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Princess when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying ""She's my queen""

[Chorus]

Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music









i had a GOOD day!!!!!! ;)




going to dry my hair so i can straighten it for tomorrow!! which is dani~elle's biday

""Girl Can Rock""

Hey!

Ready for the big time, ready for the small 
Whatever's comin' to me, I'll be ready for it all
Sometimes it ain't easy, sometimes its not polite
Some days I don't get it, some days I get it right

[Chorus:]
It's in my heart, it's in my head
Thats what i said

Hey Boys are you ready for the shock
I'm living proof, the girls can rock
Spread the new around every single block 
Hey boys, the girl can rock

Standin' in the spotlight workin' up a sweat
Givin' all i got and lovin' what i get
I can't hold back what i feel inside
and if i make you nervous, you better step aside

[Chorus]

The girl can rock
Don't say maybe or call me 'baby'
I ain't crazy at all

[Chorus 2x]

I'm gonna live it up 
I'll never give it up
I'm gonna spread the news around the block
It ain't no shock...the girl can rock [3x]

Yeah, Rock!

Ryan Cabrera
On the Way Down
Sick and tired of this world
There's no more air
Tripping over myself, going nowhere
Waiting, suffocating, no direction
I took a dive and

[CHORUS]
On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down 
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you

Been wondering why it's only me
Have you always been inside waiting to breathe
It's alright, sunlight on my face
I wake up and yet, I'm alive 'cuz

[CHORUS]
On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down 
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you

I was so afraid of going under
But now, the weight of the world 
Feels like nothing, nothing
(down, down, down)
You're all I wanted
(down, down, down)
You're all I needed
(down, down, down)
You're all I wanted
You're all I needed

And I won't forget the way you loved me
All that I wanted, all that I needed and now

[CHORUS]
On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down 
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you

  There was an American man that had an meeting in France. He met a woman and that night they had their own meeting. While they were where having sex, she was yelling, ""TROU FAUX,TROU FAUX."" He did not know what that meant, but assumed it to be some sort of praise. 
The next day, he went to play golf with the men he had the meeting with. One of them made a hole in one. He yelled, ""TROU FAUX,TROU FAUX !"" 

They looked at him and said, ""what do you mean wrong hole?""

"event","i had a really fun week so here it goes-
 
 monday- we left the house around 12:30 and got there at about 4, we set everything up and then just hung out and didnt do much, so that was kinda boring.

 tuesday-my dad and my sis went fishing and me and my mom went to the tanger outlets, i got two pairs of shorts and some really cute underwear at rue 21 and then went in to gap and got so pink body spary and lotion. and then went back to the camper and my dad and sis got home and then we went shopping for a kayak, but did get one cuz they were to expensive. and then we went back to the campground and went kayaking in a rental and then went swimming.

 weds- we went to BJ's and got my a cool looking orange and white kayak., and then we went to wally-world and then we went up to the place called castle in the sky and it was really pretty i thought it was neat. then we went back to the campground went kayaking in my new kayak and then went swimming again. 

 thurs-we wnt to the concord airport adn got a couple of drivers and their pit crew members autographs. like: david green, matt kensth, the head of nascar, the crew cheif, tire changer, and gas man of kasey kahnes pit crew. we were there from like 9 am-3:30 pm and then we went to the laconia airport and got some more autpgraphs from: martin truex jr., jeff green, greg biffle (and my dog got to play with his doggie), jamie mcmurray and his crew cheif, kevin harvick, and robby gordon. i tired to get dale earnhardt jr. but he keep driving away and i was really mad cuz he is my favorite. then we went back to the camper at about 8:30 pm. 

 friday-we went shopping at the track and then went to qualifying and martin truex jr. got dale jr. in thrid spot but he still had to start at the end. :( o well he did good. and then went to my cousins house for dinner and then went back to the camper.

 sunday- we went to the race but it wasnt very exciting, the only wreck that was in front of us was martin truex jr. and my dad was makeing fun of me cuz truex jr. was driving dale jr. car for him and that is my favorite so my dad took a whole bunch of pics of the kinda wrecked car. so yea and then when the race was over we went back to the campground and packed everything up and went to bed.

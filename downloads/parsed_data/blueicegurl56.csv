4th period is mrs sanders, english- easy class and also sorta boring it is always soo quiet but  w/e

and then 5th (or 6th w/e they wanna call it) period is mrs calvert for spanish - i love that class cuz i already know sum spanish so it is easy and the people in it are soo funny! it is probably my fav class! there r five girls and like 15 guys i guess....i sit next to matt brad and mark they r annoying but kewl and then there are alot of people across from me! but neway  it is a kewl class i have a 100 in it go me! lol

i have had a hard week it seems! sorta boring tho!

wednesday was ok! - i went to work out w/ my dad and then hung out most of the day (oh yea and cleaned)then i met my friend and we went to the movies and met carly there! the other person not to mention names couldn't get a ride! loser but w/e... anyway we saw dodgeball it was hilarious! but very stupid! the day was ok!

Thursday (yesterday)- yesterday i almost over slept disney and my dad came and yelled at me to get up... so then i went and met kacia at chickfila and we went to disney! it was fun besides for the fact there were ALOT of ugly tourists and it was REALLY REALLY hott! i could have died but we had fun hanging out! peekaboo... badger badger and wanna fanta don't u wanna! ha ha ha good times! anyway then i came home after dinner and just sat in at my computer till bout 11.... even tho my parents went out to dinner and my friend was trying to get me to go to the movies w/ him! i was like forget it! so the day was tiering (but no cleaning YAY)

Today (friday YAY) lol today i slept in and when i heard my dad coming home i jumped out of bed and acted like i had been up! (he was mad i got to sleep in cuz he had to go work out! lol) anyway we went to breakfast and then cleaned!!! AHH and then he went to lunch while i sat at home blastin my music and doin nothing! i wanted to go layoutside but no the stupid yard guy was out there and NO he wasn't cute ewww! (*preston- didn't want him to see me in my hott ass bathing suit! lol!) so i just hung out! and ate lunch very late (almost 4 o clock!) then my brother came home and annoyed the crap out of me but what else is new! so my mom is coming home in a little while after her hair cut and then we are gonna get some pizza (healthy huh?) and then who knows what i am gonna do... be stuck at home all night i guess while everyone is out havin  a life!

"event","i already know today is going to be a boring day and it is only 11.......

I woke up this morning at 7:45 (of course after staying up late last night!!) i was too tierd to barely move but my alarm kept beeping! so after i got ready my dad dragged me to his work out w/ him.... i ran on the treadmeel and did the bike thing w/e it is called. hopefully i lost some weight (not like i need to after that stupid pe summer skewl class but w/e) it wasn't that bad

then when i got home i came straight here and plopped myself down in this chair! and now i am typing away at this ok lol anyway

i was thinking.......

today is my frined kacia's birthday and she just turned 15 and got me thinking on driving ... I CAN""T wait till i get my permit only a few months left. OH YEA!!!! and i am also getting my third hole (peircing) one on the top of my ear and one right above my second hole I Can't wait for that either!

so all the driving stuff reminded me...... me and my dad were watching pimp my ride a few nites ago and we were really amuzed by all the kewl things they do to the cars and we were thinking about doing that to his car but his car is a dodge van yea a dodge van sad huh? he has been trying to get a hot rod for a while now but they won't fit more than 2 people and he needs room for his stuff so we went looking for things we could do to the van like lower it and stuff nice wheels and a good sound system! and then we found this really nice dodge car it is sorta like a van but really low and really cool! and i think we might get it i can't wait it is a very nice red and has sweet wheels and the sound system is awesome. so all we would do is maybe put some graphics on the side and video screens in the seats kewl huh? my dad is soo cool! (well sometimes!!!!!!!!) 

so yea i am going to have a dream car to drive he he he! 

anyway 

i think i am going to go lay out for a few hours my dad is out to breakfast w/ a friend so i am home alone and i am definatly bored cuz no one is on! so call the celly! cuz when my dad gets back we have to clean the back porch O YA FUN! can't wait !

As soon as i ask she says sure but if there is no chaparone i will have to go w/ u! COMON WHAT PARENT GOES W/ THERE KID TO A MOVIE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!! COMON! grrrr! so after that my dad goes u are being really selfish and so they both go off on me and i just give up and call my friend and say i cna't come... I HATE IT! i went to my room and cried half the night and then layed around doing nothing.... i almost didn't eat dinner! but w/e i am done complaining bout my gay life... i just wish i had never snuck out. i mean i only have two more weeks of summer left before my vacation i just want some freedom to have fun!

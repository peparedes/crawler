"event","not a single officer asked me if i could show them the video footage which i could have if they asked but i had to ask my boss how to burn it to disc.It was first thing in the mourning and i had only been at work 20 minutes.I was not actually charged with anything just cuffed and held there until my boss showed up.and as far as im aware they have to charge people once they cuff.guess we will find out 



this is the complaint i filed with OPCC:
I was at my place of employment in the back office when I noticed two officers (one blonde female roughly 5'10 and one peppered male 5.10)on camera at the counter in the front. the female had a pad of paper out and was switching from writing things down to operateing her radio.i was curious as to why it appeared she was questioning my co-worker so i left the office and went to the front of the store.when i got there both officers where just standing around and one greeted me with a nod. 3-5 mins later the female cop started asking me random questions without first explaining who and why she was there.i cant remember the the first question she asked me but the second question was ""when is your employer going to be in"" or something to that effect and i replied that ""my employer dosent have a set time that he comes in"" or something to that effect. the next question she asked was for the phone number of my employer to which i replied that ""i cannot give out anyones phone number but i can call them for you""the male officer interjected in rather in a hostile tone insisting that i give them the phone number to which i replied that ""I would call my employer"" he then threatened to arrest me with Obstruction or something like that.and that is when i refused to co-operate any further and he hand cuffed me giving me a short version of Miranda rights.
at this point there were 3 officers .I'm not sure when the third officer(female brunette 5'5 ) arrived but i answered all her questions and filled out a statement for her when she eventually removed my hand cuffs ......"

but then there is the fact that big businesses will be getting a tax break to the tune of $2bn and thats what i have a problem with.if the reality was the the 60% of the province that makes less the $12/hour might actually benifit slightly from this im might be ok with it but its not going to happen


the idea that some already rich asshole will get a bonus for his numbers looking good this quarter because of tax breaks the hst provides does not sit well with me

Gordon Campbell says that the hst is good for the economy but really its only good for his rich buddies.these business are not going to pass on the savings to anyone...i've seen how these companies work ..ive worked for Mc'Donalds,Easy Home,The Cash Store and they are all the same.they consist of untalented over ambitious morons that care only about pleasing their masters for the occasional pat on the back (ie:a tiny bonus).....and its the same all they way up the food chain......
they are going to keep the new profits and invent a half cooked reason as to why that savings are not being passed on......and im sure when Gordo retires or hell even now someone is sliping a little something his way for his efforts.

which brings my to resolutions from this year :

-i plan to let more things slide.i won't argue with ppl anymore.
-i strive to be less of an ass despite that fact they usually have it coming.i didnt make any one cry last year so lets try for one more year.being an ass to ppl was a social experiment that never ended and now im an addict

-i will no longer tolerate the presence of people that are completly self serving .Its like a recovering drunk that still hangs around ppl that still drink.i cant get better unless i change my surroundings.i have already gotten rid of two so called friends and scaled back contact with two others

the overall aim is to be more positive but not in a annoying chirpy gerbal faced optimist kinda way.....even though being positive is out of my comfort zone im gonna try it so that i can say yeah you diluted ass clowns are wrong i can be nice
but dont think that im going soft though.......

i not saying that i haven't been one but i like to think that I'm enlightened enough to admit when I'm wrong. denial only weakens one as a whole

there are people in this world that only want to dominate others......bring you down so that they may rest their feet on your shoulders....... most of us are ether too weak or too stupid to see or prevent that crap .....i see it all the time especially with couples and both genders are guilty

with men its usually quite obvious she has unexplained injuries or goes out of contact with her friends and family for long periods of time . very controlling and the deployment of dependancy runs amuck

with women it tends to be strictly emotional abuse its subvert so a lot of times it goes unnoticed ......i knew this family where the husband looked like a broken shell of a man the kind that would deep throat a shotgun the first chance he could .He always looked sad and always looked toward the ground .She would verbally abuse him for no reason at all.

both are a means of control by a emotional insecure person 
both of these situations upset me. if someone doesn't choose you without the application of subversion you don't deserve them

and heres how I'm a  hypocrite.i have a need to dominate others i admit it. but i don't

we all walk a path teeming in shadows
leaving regret as bread crumbs on the unyielding terrain called expectancy 
solidarity,the prison in your mind
a sociological filter that ascends most to perceived normality
wielding faith like an axe clearing foliage from the soul
speaking in hidden meanings and blasphemic answers
knowing only the blisters determination churns out
conquering  a rock face bruising its pride
rushed along by society. the insectoid beast nipping at our heels
never getting a glance at whats around us
too busy being chased by a trained ambition


we know only what we are told.from birth everything we are taught is designed to benefit someone.for we humans are inherently selfish creatures 
the first causality in the war of truth is always the lies we tell ourselves
that is the freedom i fight for.

(In response to a select group of assholes and their self righteous reaction to us going out of business)

I would like to say something to all the idiots who think we've poisoned society. And I'm not talking about the religious nuts or the militant [whining minority here]. I'm talking about this new wave of douches comprised primarily of twenty- and thirty- something white people who feel like they have to defend the little guy, despite the fact that in 2009 the little guy no longer exists, and if he does he isn't even aware there's a fight going on.

The obvious response to these people would be to say they have no sense of humor, basically because it's the truth. But too many people think sense of humor means what you do and don't laugh at. If you look up the definition that may be what it is. But to me sense of humor means you don't take things so seriously. It doesn't mean you laugh at what's funny and don't laugh at what isn't. It means you don't get pissed about what is clearly a joke.

All these damn hip people pretend to love satire as long as said satire is in agreement with views they already hold. ""Yay! They're subtly pointing out problems with government and corporations. That is brilliant satire."" But if someone delivers a bit of satire that attacks instead of defends their beliefs, well that's just pandering and juvenile.

If I write something pointing out the positives of corporations, (and they do have a LOT of positives) it would be dismissed immediately as the work of an immature douchebag. It wouldn't matter how logical and well-presented it was. Because it doesn't agree with their already held belief of ""corporations bad"" it would just be wrong.

It's all well and good to laugh at Stephen Colbert because he winks at the camera. ""You see, it's okay that he made a racist joke because he gave me a sly smirk and let me know he was kidding."" I like him and appreciate his work, but I say fuck that.

I will look you in the eye and use ""Nigger"" as a punchline because anyone with a goddamn brain should know I'm kidding. I'm not going to be a pussy and end every sentence with ""j/k"" or allude to the fact that I'm the asshole in a scenario just because modern comedy has been neutered. I have no desire to cater to the techno-savvy, utterly useless generation currently drowning in irony.

""Irony"" has come to define comedy for this group of cubicle-dwelling slackers who think the only valid form of comedy must be slathered in snarkiness and must point out that rich white people are assholes. Powerful insight, hipster. You're so goddamn busy being original you failed to notice you're about the least original thing left on the planet.

I'm also not going to censor myself just because a lot of people in this world are ignorant assholes who miss the point. There's no shortage of racists and/or wife-beaters in the world. You really think some retarded gag I thought of in a pot-fueled stupor is ""empowering"" these dicks? Rick from Meineke was going to hit Sheila tonight because he's a miserable sack of shit, not because we make a reference to a fat bitch on some strands of cotton. He's not going to look at T-Shirt Hell and go ""The shirt makes a good point. Here comes the thunder, Sheila!""

A joke, on a shirt or otherwise, has never hurt anyone. You can call that an old argument and you'd be right, but the only reason that argument has gotten old is because you emotionally coddled cunts keep presenting it. The rest of us are content to just laugh at shit and keep to ourselves.

In fact, if a joke has ever gotten anyone hurt, it would be the person delivering the joke. As in, the guy wearing one of these ""abhorrent"" shirts might possibly get his ass kicked as a result. If that's the case, the guy you call the narrow-minded piece of trash is the one having harm inflicted upon him, and probably at the hands of the guy you felt needed defending in the first place.

I suppose it doesn't really matter what I say, because the people I'm talking about here will not give my side of the argument any regard. Kind of ironic, considering many of them present themselves as pillars of open-mindedness. They can use illogical thinking to make any argument they want. In this instance they chose to complain about T-shirts, but they could just as easily have written to General Mills and complained that the goddamn Cocoa Puffs bird reinforces stereotypes.

I'm talking about the kind of people who will no doubt find contradictions in this very article, because they don't listen to people they disagree with so they can learn from or hear the other side. They only listen to people they disagree with waiting for an opportunity to prove them wrong. The same kind of people who watch FOX News ironically.

I hate Bill O'Reilly as much as anyone who doesn't eat paste, but if and when I watch his show (when my remote and legs are broken) I will attempt to get his point of view. I'm not going to watch it just so I can roll my eyes and feel smarter than a windbag with millions of dollars. ""O'Reilly is such a tool. I'm gonna go listen to the Decemberists now.""

These dicks call us racist, sexist and homophobic at the drop of a hat, all in an effort to convince themselves and others they are enlightened, but the truth is that they are, at best, oversensitive, or, at worst, insincere tools who just want to make others feel bad for enjoying something.

To me at least, racism, sexism and all the other -isms are defined by actions, not by thoughts or jokes. If I put some joke on a shirt about hunting Jews with a crossbow, it's not the new Holocaust. It's a fucking joke. Maybe it's funny and maybe it's not, but beyond that it's nothing.

You think there are one million potential Nazis out there just waiting for one retarded pun to pull the whole thing together? ""We have so much hate for Jews, but we're so disorganized. If we only had one funny shirt to get us really organiz- Well well well... What's this? A rabbi getting shoved in a meat grinder on a T-shirt? Let's go get 'em, boys!""

Forgive the analogy, but the twats who label you as uneducated or misogynistic because you had the audacity to chuckle at a retarded joke are basically the adult version of the emo kid who tries to make well-adjusted kids feel inferior because they play football instead of brooding. Fortunately emos and fags who complain about shirts have the internet to convene and strengthen each other's douchiness.

Aside from the people who deride us as a cancer on society, there are also the people who simply refer to us as immature and lowest common denominator. To those people I would just like to say: No fucking shit. You call what we do juvenile? The company that makes shirts about midgets and shaving your balls is childish? As long as you're tossing out these keen observations, why don't you point out that Fat Albert is fat and black and Albert? Hey, there's two guys 69ing each other with vibrators shoved in their asses. Could you tell me if they're gay? I just can't fucking tell.

Anyone who complains about any business is just deluding themselves that they're affecting or influencing a company's product or business practices. You're pathetic. You're not an agent of change. You're just another prick wasting your life, only you don't even have the good sense to do it with drugs, alcohol and anonymous sex. You choose to do it with your cuntish whining and morally superior brow beating.

You people are nothing more than your very own grandparents complaining about Elvis Presley's shaking hips. He was supposed to end society, but society went on. Then came your parents, and David Bowie and Martin Scorsese were supposed to ruin society. Society went on. Well now it's your turn, and what are you people complaining about? Cartoons and T-shirts.

You convince yourselves the type of entertainment we provide can undo social progress because you want to believe entertainment can provide social progress. The truth is it can't do either. Minorities gained rights because a bunch of politicians passed laws, not because Bob Dylan wrote some pretty songs.

But this is all just a lot of bluster once you realize I'm talking about fucking entertainment. You can take all the references to social commentary, satire and irony and shove them up your ass. This is all just something to be either enjoyed or glanced at and forgotten. We're not making the world a worse place and Jon Stewart isn't making the world a better place. We're all just a bunch of people saying stuff and either you like it or you don't.

Feel free to say we suck, but you don't need to quote civil rights leaders and hypothesize for ten paragraphs to justify your opinion of some fucking shirts. Just say ""Fucking lame"" and move on. When you go on a 500-word diatribe about the social relevance of our shirts you are doing two things.

1) Placing way too much importance on a bunch of shirts that, despite the handful of shirts people single out as ""over the line,"" are essentially a lot of jokes about fucking and drinking.

And 2) You are discussing the importance of that shirt, thus validating the existence of that shirt as a source of social debate, indirectly giving merit to us keeping that shirt on the site.

So, again, to all you douches who want to do away with everything ""poisoning"" society, your best bet is to greet it with indifference. When you conjure up this phony passion in defense of the beleaguered and put upon, over a bunch of JOKES, you're just being the douche the rest of us enjoy laughing at.

Oh, you can tell yourself you're different than the crazy religious lady or the angry black lady because you're more educated or intellectual, but just like them, you are complaining about a bunch of shirts. But at least those aforementioned crazy people are sincere. You people, on the other hand, are so insincere you don't even qualify as the twats you strive to be.

But despite all of your faults, I'm glad you people are out there complaining. Because long after I've killed the creative part of my brain with drugs and alcohol and we stop producing funny shirts, at least our fans will always have you people to laugh at. Tirade over. Go eat a rotting snatch."

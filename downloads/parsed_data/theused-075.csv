"event","Summer hasn't been to bad lately...but its been pretty fun. Havnt done n e thing really exciting lately but usual stuff like hanging out w/peeps and all that good stuff. Just mostly trying to make the best of it b4 i have to get a job and maybe grounding when we get our report card back. 

Hmmm....theres not really much to talk about since I cant actually write to much shit in here since everything gets around. This whole thing is like a little online family of chimpanzees. I dont know what chimps have to do with it...it just sounded like a good animal to use for that brief second.

*
*

I just wish my parents weren't so ridiculously uptight about shit and I could have so much more fun with my life. I am so tired of having to be home at 12 and them freaking out of how much I use the cell phone even though I only use it when its free. I just cant do the actuall stuff that I want to do unless I say im staying the night at Kristens. But I cant use that excuse every time. I cant wait till I can drive cuz then I wont give a fuck what they say and just hit every party possible. (I hope that doesnt make me sound like an alchy or a pothead). But thats the only thing you really can do in ER, so what can I say....

____Hope everybody has a nice summer break....and if u r to drink or use n e drugs........do it safely.

"event","Holy shit! I am so bored its not even funny. This, I must say....is by far the worst Friday ever. I am sitting here doing nothing, and will be doing nothing the rest of the night. But there is a lot of shit on my mind and I have no one to tell. I swear....ever since that big thing between me and another person happened, I have felt so lonely, but things with Kristen are so GREAT again! Cuz we are barely fighting n e more. But I miss having that other person to hang out with and talk to. He acts so different around me now but if I told him that he would think im full of shit. So that wouldn't really help. But this whole thing about still wanting to be friends thing is weird. Like I really want to hang out and stuff with him, but he doesn't really seem to want to. I just really wish I could talk to him right now.


But besides this depressed and great lonliness that I am feeling, I had so much fun yesterday night. Me, Kristen, Jenna, Jenny, Mike H., and John S. hung out. But before they should up(the painful story), we were all playing with the balls on the pool table and we made this game that jenny jenna and kristen had to get all the balls in the pockets b4 I got them all back out on the table(sounds gay but it was fun). And well, I was like kind of on my knees and the balls were flying eveywhere and I told them if I get hit with one of these balls, I am going to be pissed. Take a guess....I GOT HIT! Kristen threw one and it bounced and hit me in the forhead. It hit me so hard I fell over. It hurt so bad. It swelled really bad......like it looked like the ball was coming out of my head. But then john and mike come and we go to lockwood and play tag. I end up tripping and my shin ends up swellling and bruising and so does on the side of my knee. But 10 bagillion times worse. And I have a whole bunch of burns on my arms. It sucks. I have pain everywhere. 



Oh and me and kristen were shakin our asses to some crazy rap music...whoa...will I ever catch myself doing that again......hell yea, probably! Even though the music was, well its never good, but its fun being stupid.

"event","I havn't wrote in a while and I read some old entries of Kristens and I am so sorry that I have been a bitch to you Kristen, and to anybody else if I was. And I know it was because of Derek. But before all that shit happened, we talked a lot and I thought we were friends. Like I was the only one that wouldnt believe that he was asshole. But I finally realized he was from experiencing it. But I actually thought he wanted to be my friend. I guess I was wrong. And we do fight a lot. Probably more than any other friends. But if you think about it, it shows how open you are with them because your not keeping anything from them. Me and Kristen tell each other anything and everything. We tell are feelings and we dont always agree with things so we fight about it. But its not like were actually mad at eachother when we fight, its like an argument with my sister. But I don't have a sister, so Kristen is like my sister. 


Now I must say something because I am tired of seeing Kristen like this, and Jenna, I know you didn't want me to tell.....but, Kristen shouldnt keep going on liking Elliot when nothings gonna happen. Kristen, Elliot doesn't like you, and he probably won't again for a while. Some stuff I heard that he says about you isn't really nice at all. So you and Jenna need to stop being like this. I think Jenna should go out with Elliot...personally, I think it would be better if she did because they both really like eachother and Jenna should have a chance. So Jenna, talk with Kristen about this and go out with Elliot. If you guys like eachother, then you should go out. And Kristen, I know its hard, but just think how happy it would make Jenna and you would be doing something good by letting her. But it makes me sad to see that you like him so much and knowing that he doesn't like you. But it will suck at first to see then together, but it's gonna take sometime, and this kinda stuff happens to a lot of people. But at least you guys would be talking about it first instead of doing what you did to me, but I won't mention it.



This will be interesting to see what they say.


Hmm...
Yea.. 


Well, I guess mi padre is going to take me bowling, so I am going to fly away into reality.


adios,

"event","Today was fun. I went ice skating down at the lake with my brother and his fat friend who broke the chair when he sat down in it. And when I came back I turned it to the discovery channel and did homework. But I was listening and it got interesting, so I started watching it. And it was saying that earthquakes dont make the biggest tsunamis; they discovered that it was land slides. They had discovered it in alaska and it will hit the U.S. They dont know when but they know for sure it will hit us. But they say probably not till the next century. But this active volcano has 2 types of rock that its made out of and water can go through one of the types of rock and that is what will make the rock break off and that landslide will slide into the Pacific Ocean and it will travel to America and hit the whole east coast of the U.S. It will take around 8 hours to hit, and will make about 12 miles of destruction inwards on land. The waves it will make is higher and more destructive than the one that just hit south asia or whatever. The one that hit there they said would only make it to the fifth floor of the eifel tower, but the one that would hit us, the waves would be higher than the eifel tower. Hopefully it wont hit till were dead, but it will eventually happen. The thing is that people wont think it will happen to us because it hasnt happened in the time that people would care..but that has happened before...just so long ago that people wouldnt know. And 8 hours wouldnt be enough time to evacuate the whole east coast. But it will hit New York and the statue of liberty will be destroyed.


Its kind of scary to think about hat stuff. But I am glad I watch that crap so if that stuff ever did happen while im alive, I will know whats going on and understand. And I learn a lot about it. It was really interesting. But seriously guys...it will happen. If you dont believe me you can watch it yourself cuz I think its showing all night and stuff.

"event","I have a feeling this weekend is going to be boring. I am at my dads again cuz I quit that mat-maiding thingy. That was just way to time consuming. OMG! Today after I got home from school, I was talking on the phone w/Kristen and eating(of course), and my f-ing jaw popped and it still hurts. I have never dont that before and...it just hurts. But I made me some mashed potatoes and gravy and it was so good! If I had only one food to live on...it would be mashed potatoes.


I am excited cuz I might get to visit with some friends that I havnt seen in a while, Austin and Jeremy. There really cool, and so is Austins brother Dylan...he is so hott...but we havnt really hung out since i was like 12 or something. 

This christmas was probably the first one where I actually felt happy to get people something. Cuz I got my brother a dvd and I never get him anything, and I got kristen the My Chemical Romance cd. Which I wanted...but I wasnt going to buy something for myself. 


Dude! I just remembered next weekend me and Kristen are going to go see White Noise. And Jenna and Jenny, you guys need to come with us cuz we need to hang out again since we didnt get a chance over break. 


.....hmm.....getting bored..

"event","I get to go shopping today, I am so happy. I finally have a reason to get dressed. Ha! Yeah, I have been really lazy all week. Well, were suppose to be leaving in like 8 minutes but my stupid ass brother just got in the shower. Since when did he care how he looked. God, I hate him so much. I am so happy, I might get to go home tomorrow. Then me and Kristen are going to go shopping again. Yeah! I love shopping! Um..I am runnung ot of things to talk about. I did have a lot on my mind...hmmm, I wonder where it all went. All well.





WOW! I just realized I wrote in this thingy again. This is a record. I have never wrote in here 2 days in a row. But I thnk I will only make it to 3 days in a row. Cuz by Saturday or something, I will probably forget about it again.





So long, Fare well.....N*k*i(Ha! I love it.)"

"event","Ever since I have come to my dads(Monday), I have been bored as hell and I want to go back home. My brother is pissing me off and throwing a football at me. He hit me in the jaw and it could feel it pop or something..it really hurt. But perty much this whole break has been boring, except christmas of course. And my dad wants me to stay till Saturday and there is no way in hell I am staying here that long. I planned on going shopping w/Kristen Friday since now I have money, but im not sure if thats going to happen now. I think I would rather be in school right now. Scary....but theres more action there than here. 


Well I hope everybody else is at least having more fun than me. If I dont write in this before the new year....which is probably likely to happen...Happy New Year everybody!

"event","I really dont know how you ppl get like get on here every day and type about your life. Well if I wasnt grounded every day for the stupidest reasons then I might be able to right in here like once a week. But nothing exciting happens in my life to right about anyway. Friday I was pissed in secnd hour cuz Sean is an asshole. I guess complaining all the time is what he does best when stuff happens to him. But its ok when he does stuff to ppl. Kristen I tottaly agree with you. Cody is flippin sexy. Like I would do him any day. The hottness runs in the family. It does suck cuz we probably wont ever see them again after we graduate. I know know one else knows who I am talking about but there is these 3 guys that live where my dad lives and they are hott. And they are all brothers. I know them cuz like a long time ago my dad used to date their mom. Wierd probably but their still hott. They are one of the reasons that I come over here. Well I am running out of things to talk about and its starting to get boring again. Thats why I can never write on this thing.

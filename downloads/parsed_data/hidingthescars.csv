"event","Ok.. So I don't know what to think really.
WHat am I suppose to think.
My family is crazy... it seems like they are crazier then most families are.  
Usually to me, crazy is good... but this is too much for even me.

My mom is having a back fusion tomorrow... she wont be back for like 5 days, and wont be able to drive for two months... which basically leaves me dong the running around of Ally, and the shopping when my dad can't, and the little errands that my mom wants.

I wish that was all that was wrong... Cause that's not too bad.

My sister is driving me crazy.  She completly takes advantage of me, she wants me to drive her places but when she's with her friends... hell even when sh'es not, she's a complete bitch.  

But hey, she's a bitch to everyone... ven my mum and dad.  My mom just takes it cause ally is like a phycopath or something like that... I mean if you claim that you see hallucinations, want sombady to kill you, and write it on all papers you can get you hands on... I will call you a pychopath... So in any case... she deserves the name.

My dad has been at work constantly.. he usually doesn't get home until like 8 or 9... and today he had a concert or something to go watch at his work.. well he left at 6:30... and he's still not back.

Frank is working all the time... he's saving up for college soi can't blame him... at least he's actually planning ahead of time. 

Chris does his own thing... and i'm pretty sure that thing includes, stealing pills from my mother and either using them or selling them. or smokinf pot... and occasionaly working.  Since he's almost 20 and still living at home... he doesnt have to do much.

And here I am.. I work occasionally and the friend is my boyfriend and wehang out a couple times a week... so yeah.

Sorry for prattling so much... I just need to get stuff out of my system so I don't cut... it's been like 6 months... soI've been good... and sometimes i just wanna do, I just wanna see the blood to prove that i'm not living some fucked up dream... and feel like i have control over at least one damn thing in my life. 

Well I'm leaving Bye

"event","I don't really know what's wrong with me..... Sometimes I feel so scared and alone, even though nothing has really happend to me.  I keep thinking about Ally........ and I hav e to get this off my chest.

She betrayed my mom.... she betrayed my family.... and she's a stupid lieing bitch who just keeps trying to get attention.... I think she got a hold of my mom's old diarys (not that it's that hard... i mean i had them for a while.......) some of the things she said sounds liek it came from my mom's diary... and those ""hallucinations"" my mom said one of them is something she saw in real life when she was little.... and some of the things she says comes strait from the book ""CUT"" so I think she's faking for attention and she's taking words that's not her own.... that's how sometimes what she said actually sounded like she was for real....... and she lied when she said frank threw her into a toilet and she passed out... it's all bullshit...l i think she's like a pathelogical liar...... and the only reason she tried to actually kill herself wwas to prove everyone wrong....... to act like she is really suicidal cause all my friends were telling her that she was just doing it for attention...... iunno

I just can't belive that she did thatto my mom....that she put my mom threw hell just because she was ""hurting"" inside which i think that's probaly bullshit...  she stopped going to one therapist because the tharapist was telling her the truth.. .that she was ""attention seeking"" so she switchs therapidt......... figures that my parents didn't do anything about it


i just keep thinking how my parents will never know about me... the've never figured out.. even though it's been over 2 yhear... and they will never get it... and now i've got to try even harder to hide it from them... they can't have 2 of us going trew this.... but at least i wouldn't try to kill myu self..... i know people love me... and i know how bad it would hurt them if I killed myslef.. sometimes i think that 's the only thin that kept me alive.... but oh well.

I can't figure out what's wrong.... bu ioh well..... nothing that can be done about it so i guess i'll talk later.....

i need help.... just incase i start up again with the ""cat scratches"" my mom finalyy found the ones on my arm (the ones 6 months old that are really notice able) i said that they were from the kitten.... she belived me

later

Icompletly snapppes.. I couldn't take it anymore... I took down everything that reminded me of the ugly club... I covered up all the jones bottles... all the papers in my purse from them are all buried i the drawer and even the bulliten bored with the pictures on it I took down... al the art pictures I spent drawing with citty rayray and jeff by my side have been aken down... my walls are bare.... then my nails were still blue... from when i painted then for baue and raychel... and the paint was scratched off... the pink happy bnny wrist band I had to take off.. I bout it and the gi  pin with citty at the mal... and I took off my brittany baue is my hero shirt (i was wear it that day) and shouved it in the drawer too.... and the fear me pin jeff's sister gave me..... I can't lok at it.. it's painful... and scary.... I've snapped.... I stayed on my bed rocking back and forth and I remeber that I just kept saying make them go away and crying cause they wouldn't... the memories just flood into my mind..........the trampoline party was like a year ago (exactly the 8th)abd I can't stand remebering the great times we had that night..... but why? why should I fucking remeber it>??? what good is that gonna do? who am I gonna laugh with about the memories? who am I going to talk to who will truly understand??? they've got each ther... I've got me.... their over me ... .and they don't even know it...... if I come back to visit great.... but if not it's okay... it doesn't matter.. it's just herI feel like I'm soffacationg and ca not get enough air.... I don't know what too doo... I dont know who I am..... I'm lost in a world that doesn't even exist....  It's the end of school... but it doesn't feel like it.... last year the end of school we were trying to hang out as much as possible... we wererunning out of time....  we spent all day with each other.. I was never home.......... now I never leave... my time is up.... and happiness comes rarely.a year has past and everything has changed..... i've slipped into the dark.. and I don't want to come out....

"event","So my diet has officially  begun... though it's not much of one..... 
Food:
2 reese cups
1 bag of m&m's
10 lifesavers
like 15 razzles
1/2 f some ramen noodels and a blueberry muffis.../

the calories add up to like 1370 or something like that... so yeah I definatly need to cut down on the sweets... that'll bring down the count... and i need just to eat less in general.... so um yeah..

Phillip was beinging stupid and when i bent down o find something in my purse for beth my underwear showed some and he saw them (he was loking) and so um yeah.... then he told russ that he saw them and so russ hen asked me if he coud see my panties..... I know it'snot a big deal but hat kinda made me mad I unno why.... probaly cause he shouldn't have been looking anyways and he definatly shouldn't have told anyone what he saw.... grr..... but oh well.. it happens

Tonight was the band concert.,.. and some people told me I looked hott... but I didn't belive them... and garrett new doesn't understand why either.. I told him that if my self-esteem is already the lowest then no one can bring it down....  so the only way to go is up.......  I just don't want to belive anything like that is true or else I could ju get hurt when someone reminds me who I really am and what I really look like... a fat geeky always gonna be loser who will most likely end up becominga nothing... so um yeah that is how great my self-esteem is...............................

I've got the books ""speak"" and ""define 'normal'"" now...... I love define normal... i a favoright book of mine..... I kinda am like one of the characters......not really though..... I'm gonna go and leave ya'll in peace.... and stop somplaining

wait I found a good thing tonight.... BOTH my parents came to my band concert AND rus came... so that was good (concidering it's the first concert of mine she's been too in my high school caeer) an we didn't suck.... there you go... there's 2 good things in this  entry... be pround of the sorry loser.... cya

I'm just being stpid... last time it was me wo went to kings island with brittany's family... but you can't have everything, and they deserve to be happy... and they don't need me for that...

I remember last year for a couple months after I moved.. I was told that I was the ""glue"" of the Ugly club.... but that's not true.... they can get on with outme... I'm horrible... I don't call hem... and i expect them to update to let me know whats going on..... but they shouldn't have to.. i should call people and find out.......

I was thinking... matt told me prom was tonight for Avon,  i was just thinking ""what if"" but i already know... or I think I knw anywasy...... I'd probaly be going to prom this year if I was in avon........ I'm just being stupid and pensive like aleays... and thinking stupid things.  and I don't know why cause i'm over him and everything and I love russ so I duno why i am thinking about it now.......

yesterday I spent all day with russ and sam.... well we went to sams houe after school and my dad gave us till  4:30 to be back at the house.  well sam had to go to karate  which he had forgotten about... which left me and russ alone cause russ lied and told me sam's mom would be home.... and she wan't... but don't worry nothing bad  happened... I am still a virgin....  then we went to my house and hung out outside then rented a movie (dodgeball and spanglish) and we watched spanglish and then it was 10:30 and it was time for them too leave so it was really fun

"event","So today was intresting... I just kwpt screwing up... I wore an old ratty sweatshirt to school and my dad yelled at me in the car cause he hates the sweatshirt... but it's the only one I had clean so meh.  I got to school and me and russ we goofing around and hes like -you struck me!- and i was like nuuh! so he decided to say -you did it again- so i told him -fine i just won't tounch you anymore- and i was kinda kiding but i woldn't touch him still just to try and be funny.  Tthe when I was all like being sarcastic  he repeated it like I was serious... and I knew he was joking... so then he stopped to alk to his friends and I loked at the time and I thought it was time for class so I told him I was going... but he didn't even look up so I slpowly walked away and even waited outside my class to see if he'd catch up with me... but he didn't.

    he got mad because of me (not ""at"" me though.. <-- his words not mine)  He thought I was mad and he said that he didn't hear me say I was gona go and then he looked for me but he couldn't see me... so i screwed up and he was mad and sad and he wouldn't talk at all.. then he wrote me a note and it said -you don't evenlike me anymore so... I don't even give a fuck... I disgust you. bye-on the inside it says - you hate me. I had fun while it lasted. bye bye now-  I almost cried.. but I was in the middel of art so I didn't I'm just a screw up and I can't things right.... 
     So he was all sad for a while and IO finally convinced him that I didn't hate him but i still think he was a bit mad.  Then I had to like force him o ea because he was being stubbrn.  and during tiger time.. he just like walked out of class and came to my cladd (My teacher doesn't care but his does)  I think he forgot what was going on because he was all happay again and then it was pretty good until I got in the car to go home
    We had to take ally to the doctors and she i had to come with.  So my mom then yelled at me about my sweat shirt.  and she told me how i looked horrible and that she didn't know how i could stand looking like I do...... even though I like what I wear and russ thinks i am beatiful anyways no matter what I wear... so the only people who care are her and my dad and she doesn't seem to see that.  and she doesn't want me to go over to sams with russ cause she hinks that well go have sex some where or something like that... so io'm not real happy
   I'll think that I'll probally end up cutting tonight... yeah i guess  she desn't know me either huh?  she'll never know that I cut... she'll never know what I think everyday or who I really hang out with... she will never know what is going on in my head

"event","I have started this new journal in hopes it will relieve some of the tension and stress that had been brought upon me...  First of all I want to get this strait... I want to say I know I haven't had that badof a life.  It could be a lot worse.  So at least I know that while I'm complaining that there's someone worse off then me who may not be complaining... might as well start off with how this all started.
      I remember very little from when i moved to herrin... but i do remember asking my mother what the scars on her wrist were from... I was 7 or 8.... I remember her tell ing me that they were from when ""the pain was so bad on the inside she had to cause pain on the outside to take it aways...""  great examplae for your 8 year old huh?well in the 8th grade after I moved for the 3rd time I knew what she ment.... that's when I started cutting... the kids were horrible.  They called me horrid name and always made fun of how I looked and what I wore.  And hey always stole my things.  My mom knew something ws wrong.. but I never told her what.  I couldn't bother her with such stupid thoughts such as that.  I remember one of the first things I carved in my body were the wrods ""I hate all"" and if you look closly you can see the ""H"" still there... My mom said she was gonna put me into a counslers office but that never worked..she didn't know about the cutting... nly that I had depression (she knew enough of it to knowI had it)... In high school I begand to be happy,,, I even stopped cutting for like  3 or 4 months... but then I learned that I had to move again and it started again worse then ever
       I have tried to stop multiple times...  just resenly I went 3 weeks without cutting and the day hat I thought I had quit cutting I did it again... that was sunday night... I have a whole bunch of scars on my wrists and I wear braclets to hide themno adult knows... and the teens that know I still do it are limited to Chelsea, Beth, and Russ... 3 peopleI just need the feeling of the blade slicing my skin... It relives me because I know that this is paying me back for being stupid... And I've been thinking abou another for of self destruction... I'm thinking about becoming anorexic... by slowly cutting down the food I ake and count the calorie I eat... and exercising much much more.. I wish I had a treadmill cause it would be easier then... well I hafta go now... My entry has been long enough and now it is 10:11... I bid this journal farwell...

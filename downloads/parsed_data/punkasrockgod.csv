The vet said it happens very often, just the wrong place and they're gone.

He bled to death. It would have taken ten minutes for him to die, and i wasnt here. 

i sent him away to be cremated today. I'll have to get a nice jugy jar thing to put him in and keep with me. 

I don't remember not having him in my life, snooring away.

He should be snooring, he should be lying on a pile of clothes on my floor, snooring right now. but he's not. he's in some cold vet place waiting to be taken to sydney to be burned. 

i wont feel his fluffy body anymore and I can't snuggle him when I'm sad, I can't call him in the middle of the night to jump onto my bed.

"event","SO i just got back from my sisters a few days ago... I drove up for her birthday and stayed for almost a week... it was fantastic.. lazy days on the beach tanning up.. I'm as brown as what my mum was before she got black. 

It's beautiful. My legs need more doing though. 

So i stayed at my Niece Megan's new house with her daughter Lily... it was nice.. Kristy Megan's older sister drove down from Walca and stayed for the same amount of time that I did and stayed at her mums house. Her partner came down too.. they've been together 4 years and I'd never met him. He seemed a bit strange... like he didn't know how to act around me... at first I thought it was coz i was black... because he's one of those country bogan miner boys... and he just wouldn't even look at me or talk to me.. and he did once but he looked elsewhere while asking me a question about the tv... it was weird. Especially since he met these other people while we were there and he was best buddies by the end of the night... BUt eh.. there's worse things in the world to worry about. 

I'm watching the first season of buffy.. when she finds out that angel is a vampire. 

So it was a fabulous drive up through sydney and newcastle - my sister lives in Anna bay which is just near port stephens.. about 60kms from Newcastle right on the beach. 

It was tops, i even surfed. hahaha. 

Ohhh  when I got home I had a new car! It's tops (amy took photos - imma steal them off her so i can post!) Its a mambo painted suzuki vitara.. it was painted by Dave Mckay from Mambo in 1991... it's only done like 98,000kms..fucking drives tops.. bit sticky though but good. Amy and I go zooming around with the top off haha (We're hot ay ayms!) 

Anyway.. Amy is leaving soon :( she is going home to Rockhampton for a few weeks

I will miss my amy... :( Cube just wont be the same without. 

ooh and the possible new job - Uluru! If i get it I will be off to the community near Uluru (Mutijulu) to live for 3 months and will organise the summer sports program for the young black kids up there - it'll be tops! Get Nike to fix up the basketball court they built 5 years ago which is no run down... *sigh* it'll be gooooood!

LISA! I miss you... we must have dinner before I leave! Usual place? xxxxx

Donkey joins, freckles, poncho and panda.. and hesheit has lots of fun eating algae and floating around and hiding. 

What a LIFE!

I'm going away in a week to visit my sister and my sisters daughter and my sisters grand daughter! oh my gawd.. I'm old if my sister is a grandma right? 

New joke at the sketch.. check it out. 

Sketchycrew.com how many times do I have to tell you to join! Have you joined yet? JOIN!

All turned out well on the down below front... picked up my car on saturday morning, dad was in a better mood, mum so much wasnt but she apologised for being a bitch and then was like ""but you have to remember your dad and I have ptsd.."" i told her to stop using it as an excuse basically because its post traumatic for them it's not suppose to cause me trauma. and she said she's sorry that she made me feel crap. 

So all weekend I spent cleaning! I kid you not.. we made a new laundry in this back room that was being used for nothing, so we have two laundry's now.. that may seem not cool to some.. but i like building things and making stuff.. so it was cool for me LOL. 

So jess and victor have their own laundry and mum and i have one too. 

Then I proceded to go through boxes that I haven't unpacked in 3 -7 years!! I found my grade 8 school diary, my grade 9, grade 10.. oh my god.. and photographs... terrible!! lol it was such fun.. oh and I found this scarf i was knitting like 3 years ago so i'm attempting to finish it LOL. then I cleaned the bathroom, the kitchen, the loungeroom.. I even scrubbed mum's persians... and I cleaned my room and made my bed.. I finished at about 6 o'clock last night. started at 9am (in the morning!!) on saturday.

my doggie hurt his hip.. he was jumping out of dad's wrangler and must have knocked his leg on the towbar and jarred it coz he's been hopping along for the last few days. But its getting better. 

OH OH OH AND IM A FRAUD!!! optus mobile has called me a fraud... coz this stupid idiot kid there called the wrong number looking for me and just assumed i was a fraud!!! so kim my personal account manager is sorting it out and giving me TONS AND TONS of ""we're really sorry please dont move carriers"" credit. so I don't think I'll have to pay my bill for awhile. What kind of new phone should I get? I've got a sony ericson P910i at the moment.. so not much can out do it for me... i've looked and cannot find.. any suggestions? ... no?

so I can't really decide what subjects to do next semester.. there isn't anything decent. 

I signed up for Indigneous societies and adaption or something, lit studies 2, and food and beverage something or other... which apparently gives you no credit points and has no study load... So i have to ring up about that tomorrow. 

my hand is killing me from writing so fast and eractic today so I'm off to soothe it.. LOL

riki :D

p.s
the possum still hasn't been moved... =/"

"event","today my dad's new phone arrived. so he took me to brekky down in fyshwick then we went and picked up his mattress for his caravan. 

then i went back to hall with him and cleaned his caravan and made his bed and told him if its messy tomorrow i'll slap him. 

So tomorrow I have to go to Lucy's at 9 and study ergh. 

Dad is itchy to get going, so we're out at the end of the month, he wants me to go up with him and see uncle alex, and then hop the train back from lismore, so i'll probably be gone for a week or so, so that sounds sweet. he's going to go up further north and over west and look for a yacht to buy, then go on a big sailing adventure, and I get the wrangler!!! :D

I'm still losing heaps of weight.. I haven't been eating. Not because I'm starving myself or anything, but because I'm not hungry, like.. i don't even think about it. If dad didn't take me to breky practically every day I probably wouldn't eat at all, because at the moment, that's all I've been eating. Brekky with him. 

I told the doctor that but she doesn't really see how its a problem, she just told me to like have an alarm and eat even if i'm not hungry.. but it seems all I can really stomach is cereal or salad when i do eat.. so i dunno. 

oh well.

"event","So here I am lying in bed with my dog snooring like he owns my pillows and reading the notes i wrote for my exam while watching lost and drinking chocolate milk out of my Guiness glass.

Oww, and I just hit my head on the bed head. 

<lj-cut>

Danny wrote me this really sweet email last night, telling me how everything at work was going, and all the neat new techie stuff that we've been getting, and basically how I can work the shifts i wanna work when i wanna work. 

Picked up mums car this morning - cost me two grand. I am officially in $14, 500 worth of debt, which nothing to show for it but great hair and fairly sweet jhebus clothes and a growing dvd collection. I added 200 cigarettes to it today, and the last days of disco, and the tenth kingdom series. 

oh no.. poor john locks leg is stuck. 

So I went and saw Dr. Ann on tuesday, that was pretty decent, she wants me to see her every month and keep seeing Marg at the dept. of veterans affairs. she's weening me off the 75mg of xefexor or whatever its called and put me on half a tab of 20mg Lovan. then is moving me up up and away. 

I got dad a new 3g phone, which should arrive tomorrow, he's pretty excited. 

Timmy told jess that he has a crush on me, and loves my boobs LOL. this is a dude I've known for almost a year, who I've always thought was gay. 
</lj-cut>
I think Silas thinks that we're going to get back together. Why he thinks that I don't know... I'm not moving back to Melbourne any time soon and he's not planning a move here. 
<lj-cut>
I'm tagging along with dad at the end of the month up north to anna bay to visit my sister and niece and my nieces daughter for a few days.. probably jump a bus back or something... I might drop into Raymond Terrace and see Bec and her new baby and have a booty call with Brian. 

I got my sociology essay back - I got a horrific result back. He cut me to shreads. he even picked on the dot points I used for the bibliography... and marked me down for it. for friggen dot points.. then he marked me down for it being late, when he gave me an extension!! So i have to go talk to him about it... Lucy reckons he was just in a fowl mood. 

Went and saw The Break-Up tonight with mum, it wasn't bad... I thought about Silas through the whole thing.... Vince Vaughns character is just... so Silas, except for the end dinner bit. (I'm not giving it away!)
</lj-cut>
Then I thought about how Adam broke up with me.. and how he broke my heart. But still tells me he wants to be with me, then goes on an indefinate trip overseas... He can just... deal with it himself. I'm so over him. I'm just not over the way he thinks I can be okay with everything and we're just going to fall back in place. 
<lj-cut>
Went to Uni on tuesday - Del was there - it was just her and I in the computer lab.. and she was just being a dick you know banging things, and turning her music up really loud and just being a knob head.. i didn't even realise it was her for about 10 minutes I was so engrosed in what I was doing. 

Then I had a good talk to Paulie who works at the Indigenous Centre - he's bi polar, and he gave me all this neat stuff to do like breathing styles and things like that and we had a good chat, and he told me that over the years I've looked after alot of the mob out there and him and I can lean on him if I ever need to. So that made me feel good. I realise that people actually do see me and aren't fooled by lies that seem to get spread about me alot. 

Dr. Ann said that I put on a pretty top notch facade.. and I need to learn how to feel my emotions on my face and things like that and not smile when I'm talking about bad shit... apparently for the whole 2 hours while I was telling her my 'dogs dinner' of a life story i had a smile on my face the whole time. I just don't realise I'm doing it. It's just been a coping mechanism I guess. 
</lj-cut>
But Oh well.. :)

I'll figure it all out one day - I've got a massive amount of time to work on things. 
<lj-cut>
I'm feeling pretty good so far. 

Lisa - I appreciate you so much. And I wish I could give what you give me, back to you. (one day! i promise!)
HayHay.. all these years - I'm glad I've known you and I look forward to many more!
Donnaleekiss - I appreciate your wise words, they definetly sink in!

I finally got my pictures from perth developed!!! like 8 months later!! LOL Dan and brett have been hassling me for them lol they were so excited when i told them i finally did it!

I think i might join one of those depression support group things that meet and do stuff...&nbsp; 

I didn't think I'd get to this point of my life and be nothing.&nbsp; 

When I was 15... I thought I had it great and would continue to have it great... at 16 I realised my friends were backstabbing bastards after adrian made me have sex with him then all our friends suddenly stopped talking to me.&nbsp; 

by 17 I realised that I was a non intelligent loser.&nbsp; 

by 18 I thought I could have a new start at uni and do okay&nbsp; 

by 19 i moved onto ressies and thought I could be pretty independant.. but then dawn was murdered and something happened and I freaked out and moved to Melbourne to live with mum.. we faught so much that I moved into my own flat just before my 20th and got really into my own life.. working and just living and things...&nbsp; had my 21st...then I got a really great boyfriend...moved&nbsp;back in with mum....&nbsp;moved to canberra.. left him there... never loved him as much as he loved me...&nbsp; 

Now I'm 22 and I dont have anything. Well I mean I have alot.. I have 2 cars... a roof over my head... 2 dogs a cat.. 3 fish.. jess and victor who yell at each other every night.. an electric blanket a caring but irritating (sometimes) mum and an unrepaired heart.&nbsp;

I onoly just got home a few moments ago...&nbsp;

My last thoughts and last actions were... Jose...&nbsp;

Jose is from my work.&nbsp;

Jose asked me where i'd been as he'd heard I'd been sick and asked if I was getting better. I can't exactly remember what I told him.. only that I was on new meds and taking it easy.. as i sipped my Long Island Ice TEA.&nbsp;

He also gave me a hug. and bought me a drink.&nbsp;with vodka in it. i think that was my tenth vodkadrionk.&nbsp;
I can't s[eelly spell drink.&nbsp;

Jessica was sick in the bathroom... we drank the same amount.. but she's fucked. seriously fucked. victor was yelling at everyone.. I actually got to learn a new side of him tonight... he was angry but concerned for her.. but he trusted me to take care of her, like i told him I would.. and I did.&nbsp;

We went to Club Mombasa, than we hit north, bar32, echo, north again then sat at echo til like 430.&nbsp;

I got kissed by two different guys. they were grose, i was trying not to kiss them but you know when they just go and you're like ""DUDE GET AWAY"" some fuckhead bit my chin.&nbsp;
cock head.&nbsp;

But jose... he hugged me.. *sigh*

He was my trainer, when I first started at work... he trained me.. sometimes.. when tunksy wasn't.&nbsp;

I love him. well not love love.. but oh man..&nbsp;

timmy from work came out with us for a while... only about an hour though because he had to work at 8.&nbsp;

I think I might have to go to work next week just to see jose... and write him and email and see how his night went.&nbsp;

I CANT BELIEVE HE HUGGED ME.&nbsp;

"event","<p>So it's like fucking 307am (that's morning for you jokers)</p>
<p>I've just been driving around Canberra with Jess. (not the slut Jess - The jess my sister girl jess)</p>
<p>We went to Manuka to get cash out of the ATM then went to coles (mind you I was in my pj pants, my jumper scarf and no fucking shoes! in like cold cold weather... ) </p>
<p>I smoked two cigarettes tonight.. TWO... *sigh*</p>
<p>No more.. I've just been so stressed. </p>
<p>Then after coles we went up to Parliment House and cruised around it a few times, stopped and chatted to this security guard named nyoyo or something russian sounding we stopped by him twice... after going around a few times.. so fucking hot.. he smiled really sweetley too.. I was such a dick. </p>
<p>He wants us to go back Wednesday night and see him.. he works from 7 til 7. LOL. </p>
<p>then after P P house we went down northbourne and ran into this p plater girl who was sitting on the side of the road so we pulled over and asked if she needed help... so we helped her change her tyre and she told us that she got a dent in her new 2 week old lancer and a tree was destroyed on northbourne as you're coming around the circle into the city (I dunno what the st names are called but look out for a dead fallen down pine tree!) We were there! But she ran up to gutter... silly P platers... </p>
<p>Then Jess' bboyfriend called ""WHERE ARE YOU WHERE ARE YOU"" control freak... </p>
<p>So we drove home.. and here I am now.. that makes me think of that song ... 'here i am baby... oooh come and take me... take me by the hand... "" </p>
<p>I feel like listening to UB40</p>
<p>Riki. </p>
<p>P.s Simon used the excuse that he is muslim and following his faith to a 't' now as a reason for no longer speaking to me unless I have a male relative around. FUCK HEAD. </p>

I think that I need to explain clearly that Andrew is not a replacement for you and was never considered to be. Also I am the mother of a very gorgeous and vivacious 7 year old and there are safety issues to consider. I have explained this to Andrew and he understands.

Secondly the issue of the floor board is only my issue with dealing with access to the hoiuse to view the cracked floor board. If any cost is associated the damage than that will fall on you. 

I have just recieved this email so I will discuss with Rod and seek some legal advice myself. Lastly could we please reframe from personal matters in our relationship when dealing with the Real Estate as I am going to continue leasing from this agent and also you might seek a reference from her. I reframed from being our personal issues in the original email, so, email me personally in another email and we can discuss them.

Thank you 

Delephene

My response:

Delephene,

I'm well aware of the costs associated with the removal company and have 
been speaking to them since it occured. Please do not advise me of things 
I'm clearly already aware of and have knowledge of.

Also,&nbsp; I would appreciate if you would not tell me how to address issues and 
who needs to be aware of them or not. What and who I choose to include in my 
business, is my business

Libby is the realtor and I believe she should be fully aware of things that 
are happening. I included her in that email because it had information 
relevent to her. i.e the Tenants Union information.

This isn't personal, but feel free to look at it that way. This is simply 
what it is. Someone wishing to take care of her medical and financial needs 
in the surroundings of her family. The way you have behaved has started 
turning it personal, which isn't something that I wanted, as I'm sure you're 
well aware from my initial letter.

If the matter can not be sorted out as soon as possible I will be seeking a 
review infront of the Tribunal. I have plenty of grounds to appeal on which 
I believe are fair grounds for releasing me from the lease.

So the easiest and fastest way for all, would be appreciated so as things 
need not go any further.

Ta,

Arika.


Her emails are so fucking FAKE. she is such a FAKE.

I swear to god.. if she makes this any more difficult I will open my mouth so fucking wide she will be evicted in ten seconds flat.&nbsp;"

So today out at Uni it's sorry day - and I promised andrew I would take my ochre and paint the kids faces because they're doing a dance or something.

Then I have to go to work. I'm kinda scared.. I haven't been for like a month. I had a bad dream about work the other day... *sigh* Everyone loved me in it though.&nbsp;

Silas rang me the other day... to tell me he loves me still.&nbsp;That was weird.&nbsp;

"event","Arika,

This is an email to inform you in writing as attempts to lock in a time with you to discuss your tenancy of above adress have failed. Including the incident yesterday which was - you leaving the premises without discussing the issue of the removalist dropping your couch in the lounge room and spilting a floor board from the impact. 

It is my understanding that you and myself are co-tenants of 27 Garrad court, Charnwood for a fixed term lease of 12 mths, which ends in February 2007. You and I are liable for rent until this time unless other arrangements can be made.

I am from here going to discuss with Rod our future options of this residency as I do like this place dearly. It is also your responsibility to follow up the issue of the floor board with the removalist as I believe that are a few issues of 'duty of care'. I will be in contact with you about Rod and I decision about Garrad Court this maybe including the possilbilty of you finding a new tenant. 

Will be in contact soon


And here's my response,&nbsp;

Delephene,

I have recently spoken to the Tenants Union about my rights and 
responsibilities and also spoken with Libby, the realtor of 27 Garrad Court.

Also you have not made any attempt to contact me via phone or email to 
'arrange a time to lock in' you are also hardly available when I attempt to 
call you or go to garrad court. This is hardly my fault.

I am also following the matter up with the removalists, and I understand 
that yesterday they gave you information in regards to how they will go 
about fixing the problem with the floor board. This is a responsibility 
between them and you as the current tenant to make a time available for them 
to go about fixing it.

Legally I do not have a responsibility to find you a new tenant. As you are 
aware Andrew had interest in taking my spot but has not been contacted by 
you in regards to that in over 2 weeks. I gave you plenty of notice to go 
about finding yourself a suitable replacement.

There are many ways we can go about my responsibility being relinquished.

1. A new lease can be drawn up with you and whoever you are wishing to sign 
the lease with. This involves solicitors which I'm happy to deal with.
2. Someone who wants to take over the lease with you, can be drawn up to 
take over my spot and I can be removed from the lease.
3. You can relinquish via letter my responsibilities and liabilities if you 
cause any damage etc to the property at the end of the tenancy to myself and 
the landlord and I will in turn sign the entire bond over to you. As you may 
be aware, it is in both our names and you will need my signature to have it 
returned.

When you've discussed the above options with Rod, please contact me via 
email as I do not want to have any verbal contact with you in the future 
assuming that you're going to be as rude and unbecoming as you were 
yesterday.

I will also be coming over sometime,&nbsp; as you are aware my share of the rent 
is paid up until the 6th of june, to clean my area and also collect a few 
other things that I would like you to make available to me which I believe 
are in your daughters bedroom being used by her.

1. My green lamp and
2. My coffee table throw.

I would also like my yellow ralph lauren polo top and red miss shop top with 
frills returned.

If this is in regards to money, perhaps you could take it out of the $185 
dollars that you owe my mother and place an ad in the paper to find someone 
who suits your living conditions.

Thanks.



*SIGH*

IS that Okay??? She CCd her email to the realtor so I did the same - and also to my mum."

"event","So i went into uni this afternoon, got two essays back, got 15/20 for one and 22.5/30 for the other.&nbsp;

So I moved all my stuff today...&nbsp;

in words of Shane (one of the movers) ""That girl in there is being a RIGHT COW""

She had her mum there and all - 32 year old woman who needs her mummy... right.. then when I said hello to the both of them, they ignored me.. then I get a call and a message on my answering service saying ""You didn't leave the key - I find you extremely offensive""

So i rang back and she was like we have matters to discuss such as you giving me back the key - and i just said i've paid til the 6th of june - i'm coming back to clean and once i have i'll leave the key - then she decided to threaten me with legal action and said she has a letter for me that she wrote because I (yes me) don't like confrontation, according to her.&nbsp;

So i rang up the Tenants union and they were like well if she wont agree that you are no longer liable for anything, just refuse to sign the entire bond over to her (she paid it - but its in both our names)&nbsp;

so i'm going to write a letter to her basically saying - you relinquish me of any liability at the end of the lease and i'll sign the bond over to her - if she doesn't agree ... well She can get fucked basically.&nbsp;

I cut the phone off to because it's in my name - she stood in there and complained about the water that was on the laundry room floor - I put her wet clothers that were in the washing machine (MY WASHING MACHINE) into a basket on the floor - she knew the movers were coming today - but did she care... no.&nbsp;

I wish I'd never met her.

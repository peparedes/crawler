I'm selfish, impatient, and a little insecure. I make mistakes. I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you don't deserve me at my best.

Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius, and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely stupid~Marilyn Monroe

I would like to tell you that everything is automatically better when you reach a certain age--but unfortunately that's a myth. I think the only difference is that we can look back over our lives and realize there truly are more good days than bad and each new crisis that comes along isn't quite as devastating as they were when we were younger

Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up.  It knows it must run faster than the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning a lion wakes up.

When the sun comes up, you'd better be running ~ Serengeti Proverb"

"event","Hide and seek was one of my favorite childhood games. I was pretty good at it, the hiding part that is. Sometimes I was too good, for while I hid scrunched in some miserable position, like a sardine pressed between the car doors and garage wall, or tucked away like a blanket on some upper closet shelf, I could hear the laughter and happy voices of those discovering and being discovered, of the one finding and those already found, and I knew I was more the loser than the winner in the game.

Have we let ourselves be found by God, or are we still in hiding? Are we hiding in our own righteousness, as if we had something worth mentioning before God? Or are we hiding in our own shame, refusing to let His blood wash every sin away? Are we hiding in fear, wondering if God can even be trusted? He can be trusted. He won't hurt us like other people have hurt us. He won't disappoint us like we've disappointed ourselves. He alone is faithful and true. What are we waiting for? It's time to come out of hiding and share in His joy. Can we hear the happy voices?

"event","""Starts With Goodbye""
I was sitting on my doorstep,
I hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand,
But I knew I had to do it,
And he wouldn't understand,
So hard to see myself without him,
I felt a piece of my heart break,
But when you're standing at a crossroad,
There's a choice you gotta make.

I guess it's gonna have to hurt,
I guess I'm gonna have to cry,
And let go of some things I've loved,
To get to the other side,
I guess it's gonna break me down,
Like falling when you try to fly,
It's sad, but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life,
Starts with goodbye.

I know there's a blue horizon,
Somewhere up ahead, just waiting for me,
Getting there means leaving things behind,
Sometimes life's so bitter sweet.

I guess it's gonna have to hurt,
I guess I'm gonna have to cry,
And let go of some things I've loved,
To get to the other side,
I guess it's gonna break me down,
Like falling when you try to fly,
It's sad, but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life,
Starts with goodbye.

Time, time heals,
The wounds that you feel,
Somehow, right now.

I guess it's gonna have to hurt,
I guess I'm gonna have to cry,
And let go of some things I've loved,
To get to the other side,
I guess it's gonna break me down,
Like falling when you try to fly,
It's sad, but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life,
Starts with goodbye,
I guess I'm gonna have to cry,
And let go of some things I've loved,
To get to the other side,
Starts with goodbye,
The only way you try to find,
Moving on with the rest of your life,
Starts with goodbye,
Na na na na na na na.


""Lessons Learned""
There's some things that I regret,
Some words I wish had gone unsaid,
Some starts that had some bitter endings,
Been some bad times I've been through,
Damage I cannot undo,Some things,
I wish I could do all all over again,
But it don't really matter,
Life gets that much harder,
It makes you that much stronger,
Oh, some pages turned,
Some bridges burned,
But there were lessons learned.

And every tear that had to fall from my eyes,
Everyday I wondered how I'd get through the night,
Every change, life has thrown me,
I'm thankful, for every break in my heart,
I'm grateful, for every scar,
Some pages turned,
Some bridges burned,
But there were lessons learned.

There's mistakes that I have made,
Some chances I just threw away,
Some roads,
I never should've taken,
Been some signs I didn't see,
Hearts that I hurt needlessly,
Some wounds that I wish I could have one more chance to mend,
But it don't make no difference,the past can't be rewritten,
You get the life you're given,
Oh, some pages turned,
Some bridges burned,
But there were,
Lessons learned.

And every tear that had to fall from my eyes,
Everyday I wondered how I'd get through the night,
Every change, life has thrown me,
I'm thankful, for every break in my heart,
I'm grateful, for every scar,
Some pages turned,
Some bridges burned,
But there were lessons learned.

And all the things that break you,
Are all the things that make you strong,
You can't change the past,
Cause it's gone,
And you just gotta move on,
Because it's all,
Lessons learned.

And every tear that had to fall from my eyes,
Everyday I wondered how I'd get through the night,
Every change, life has thrown me,
I'm thankful, for every break in my heart,
I'm grateful, for every scar,
Some pages turned,
Some bridges burned,
But there were lessons learned,
Oh, some pages turned,
Some bridges burned,
But there were lessons learned,
Lessons learned."

"event","HOW TO STAY YOUNG
1. Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight and height. Let the doctors worry about them. That is why you pay ""them."" 

2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down. 

3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening, whatever. Never let the brain idle. ""An idle mind is the devil's workshop."" And the devil's name is Alzheimer's. 

4. Enjoy the simple things. 

5. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath. 

6. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person, who is with us our entire life, is ourselves. Be ALIVE while you are alive. 

7. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it's family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge.

8. Cherish your health: If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get help. 

9. Don't take guilt trips. Take a trip to the mall, even to the next county; to a foreign country but NOT to where the guilt is. 

10.Tell the people you love that you love them, at every opportunity. 


AND ALWAYS REMEMBER:
Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away."

From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this:

What Makes 100%?

What does it mean to give MORE than 100%?

Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%?

We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over
100%.

How about achieving 103%?

What makes up 100% in life?

Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these
questions:

If:
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
is represented as:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26.

Then:

H-A-R-D-W-O-R- K is
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%

and

K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E is
11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%

But,

A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E is
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%

And,
B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T is
2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%

AND, look how far ass kissing will take you.

A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G
1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118%

So, one can conclude with mathematical certainty that, while Hard Work and Knowledge will get you close, and Attitude will get you there, it's the Bullshit and Asskissing that will put you over the top."

"event","The Buzzard, the Bat and the Bumble Bee 
 
*_THE BUZZARD_* If you put a Buzzard in a pen that is 6 feet by 
8 feet and is entirely open at the top, the bird, in spite of its ability to fly, will be an absolute prisoner. The reason is that a Buzzard always begins a flight from the ground with a run of 10 to 12 feet. Without space to run, as is its habit, it will not even attempt to fly, but will remain a prisoner for life in a small jail with no top. 
 
*_THE BAT_* 
 
The ordinary Bat that flies around at night, a remarkably nimble creature in the air, can not take off from a level place. If it is placed on the floor or flat ground, all it can do is shuffle about helplessly and, no doubt painfully, until it reaches some slight elevation from which it can throw itself into the air. Then, at once, it takes off like a flash. 
 
_THE BUMBLE BEE_ 
 
A Bumble Bee, if dropped into an open tumbler, will be there until it dies, unless it is taken out. It never sees the means of escape at the top, but persists in trying to find some way out through the sides near the bottom. It will seek a way where none exists, until it completely destroys itself. 
 
_PEOPLE_ In many ways, we are like the Buzzard, the Bat, and the Bumble Bee. We struggle about with all our problems and frustrations, never realizing that  all we have to do is look up!

"event","Lessons in Life

By Regina Brett The Plain Dealer, Cleveland, Ohio

To celebrate growing older, I once wrote the 45 lessons life taught me. It is the most-requested column I've ever written. My odometer rolls over to 50 this week, so here's an update:

 1. Life isn't fair, but it's still good.
 2. When in doubt, just take the next small step.

 3. Life is too short to waste time hating anyone.

 4. Don't take yourself so seriously. No one else does.

 5. Pay off your credit cards every month.
 
 6. You don't have to win every argument. Agree to disagree.

 7 Cry with someone. It's more healing than crying alone.

 8. It's OK to get angry with God. He can take it.

 9. Save for retirement starting with your first paycheck.

10. When it comes to chocolate, resistance is futile.

11. Make peace with your past so it won't screw up the present.

12. It's OK to let your children see you cry.

13. Don't compare your life to others'. You have no idea what their  journey is all about.

14. If a relationship has to be a secret, you shouldn't be in it.

15. Everything can change in the blink of an eye. But don't worry; God never blinks.

16. Life is too short for long pity parties. Get busy living, or get busy dying.

17. You can get through anything if you stay put in today.

18. A writer writes. If you want to be a writer, write.

19. It's never too late to have a happy childhood But the second one is up to you and no one else.

20. When it comes to going after what you love in life, don't take no for an answer.

21. Burn the candles, use the nice sheets, wear the fancy lingerie. Don't save it for a special occasion. Today is special.

22. Over prepare, then go with the flow.
23. Be eccentric now. Don't wait for old age to wear purple.
24. The most important sex organ is the brain.

25. No one is in charge of your happiness except you.

26. Frame every so-called disaster with these words: ""In five years, will this matter?""

27. Always choose life.

28. Forgive everyone everything.

29. What other people think of you is none of your business.

30. Time heals almost everything. Give time time.

31. However good or bad a situation is, it will change.

32. Your job won't take care of you when you are sick. Your friends will.  Stay in touch.

33. Believe in miracles.

34. God loves you because of who God is, not because of anything you did or didn't do.

35 Whatever doesn't kill you really does make you stronger.

36. Growing old beats the alternative -- dying young.

37. Your children get only one childhood. Make it memorable.

38. Read the Psalms. They cover every human emotion.

39. Get outside every day. Miracles are waiting everywhere.

40. If we all threw our problems in a pile and saw everyone else's, we'd grab ours back.

41. Don't audit life. Show up and make the most of it now.

42. Get rid of anything that isn't useful, beautiful or joyful.

43. All that truly matters in the end is that you loved.

44. Envy is a waste of time. You already have all you need.

45. The best is yet to come.

46. No matter how you feel, get up, dress up and show up.

47. Take a deep breath. It calms the mind.

48. If you don't ask, you don't get.

49. Yield.

50. Life isn't tied with a bow, but it's still a gift"

Lyrics for Song: Size Matters (Someday)

Someday she wants a big ol' house
Sittin' on a big ol' hill
And a mile long tree lined driveway
For her big ol' Coupe DeVille
Yeah, someday she wants a big ol' bank account
With too much to spend
But right now all she wants is a man

With a big ol' heart
Who can love her like nobody can
Big ol' kisses that go on and on
And never end
With a big ol' smile
He'll fill her world with laughter
Size matters, size matters

Someday she wants a big o' ring
With a big ol' rock that shines
And a big ol' walk-in closet
With shoes of every kind
Yeah, someday she wants a big ol' boat
She can lay around gettin' a tan
But right now all she wants is a man

With a big ol' heart
Who can love her like nobody can
Big ol' kisses that go on and on
And never end
With a big ol' smile
He'll fill her world with laughter

Lyrics for Song: Just Might (Make Me Believe)

I got miles of trouble spreadin' far and wide
Bills on the table gettin' higher and higher
They just keep on comin', there ain't no end in sight
I'm just holdin' on tight
I got someone who loves me more than words can say
And I'm thankful for that each and every day
And if I count all my blessings, I get a smile on my face
Still it's hard to find faith

But if you can look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave
You just might make me believe

It's just day to day tryin' to make ends meet
What I'd give for an address out on Easy Street
I need a deep margarita to help me unwind
Leave my troubles behind

I used to believe in us when times go tough
But lately I'm afraid that even love is not enough

Ohhhhhhhh
But if you can look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave
You just might make me
Oh you just make me
You just might make me believe"

I love you, Sorry,and Help me.

One morning you will never wake up. 
Do all your friends know you love them? 
I was thinking...I could die today, tomorrow or next week, and I
wonderedif I had any wounds needing to be healed, friendships that needed rekindling or three words needing to be said. Let every one of your friends know you love them. Even if you think they don't love you back, you would be amazed at what those three little words and a smile can do. And just in case GOD calls me home before I see you again....... I
LOVE
YA!!! 
Live today to the fullest because tomorrow is not promised 

Be kinder than necessary, for everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle."""

You'll break hearts too, so remember how it felt when yours was broken. You'll fight with your best friend. You'll blame a new love for things an old one did. You'll cry because time is passing too fast, and you'll eventually lose someone you love. 

So take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like you've never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness you'll never get back.

"event","Maybe . .. we were supposed to meet the wrong people before  
meeting the right one so that, when we finally meet the right person,  
we will know how to be grateful for that gift. 
 
Maybe . . . when the door of happiness closes, another opens;  
but, often times, we look so long at the closed door that we don't  
even see the new one which has been opened for us. 
 
Maybe . . . it is true that we don't know what we have until we lose it, 
but it is also true that we don't know what we have been missing until 
it arrives. 
 
Maybe . . . the happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of 
everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along 
their way. 
 
Maybe . . . the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten 
past; after all, you can't go on successfully in life until you let go 
of your past mistakes, failures and heartaches. 
 
Maybe . . . you should dream what you want to dream; go where you  
want  to go, be what you want to be, because you have only one life
and one chance to do all the things you dream of, and want to do. 
 
Maybe . . . there are moments in life when you miss someone -- 
a parent, a spouse, a friend, a child -- so much that you just want to 
pick them from your dreams and hug them for real, so that once they 
are around you appreciate them more. 
 
Maybe . . . the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch 
and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it  
was the best conversation you've ever had. 
 
Maybe . . you should always try to put yourself in others' shoes. If you 
feel that something could hurt you, it probably will hurt the other 
person, too. 
 
Maybe . . you should do something nice for someone every single day, 
even if it is simply to leave them alone. 
 
Maybe . . giving someone all your love is never an assurance that 
they will love you back. Don't expect love in return; just wait for it 
to grow in their heart; but, if it doesn't, be content that it grew in yours. 
 
Maybe . . . happiness waits for all those who cry, all those who hurt, 
all those who have searched, and all those who have tried, for only they 
can appreciate the importance of all the people who have touched their 
lives. 
 
Maybe . . . you shouldn't go for looks; they can deceive; don't go for 
wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile, 
because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Find the 
one that makes your heart smile. 
 
Maybe . . you should hope for enough happiness to make you sweet,  
enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human,  
and enough hope to make you happy.

Maybe. . . you could send this message to those people who mean 
something to you, to those who have touched your life, to those who  
can and do make you smile when you really need it, to those who 
make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down, 
and to all those whom you want to know that you appreciate them and  
their friendship."

I hope that days come easy and moments pass slow,
And each road leads you where you want to go,
And if you're faced with a choice, and you have to choose,
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you.
And if one door opens to another door closed,
I hope you keep on walkin' till you find the window,
If it's cold outside, show the world the warmth of your smile,

More than anything, more than anything,
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want
it to, that your dreams stay big, and your worries stay small,
You never need to carry more then you can hold,
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to,
I hope you know somebody loves you, and wants the same things
too, Yeah, this, is my wish.

I hope you never look back, but ya never forget,
All the ones who love you, in the place you left,
I hope you always forgive, and you never regret,
And you help somebody every chance you get,
Oh, you find God's grace, in every mistake,
And you always give more than you take.

Oh More than anything, Yeah, and more than anything,
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want
it, that your dreams stay big, and your worries stay small,
You never need to carry more then you can hold,
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to,
I hope you know somebody loves you, and wants the same things
too, Yeah, this, is my wish."

"event","A young wife sat on a sofa on a hot humid day, drinking iced tea and visiting with her Mother. As they talked about life, about marriage, about the responsibilities of life and the obligations of adulthood, the mother clinked the ice cubes in her glass thoughtfully and turned a clear, sober glance upon her daughter.

""Don't forget your Sisters,"" she advised, swirling the tea leaves to the bottom of her glass. ""They'll be more important as you get older. No matter how much you love your husband, no matter how much you love the
children you may have, you are still going to need Sisters. Remember to go places with them now and then; do things with them.""

""Remember that 'Sisters' means ALL the women... your girlfriends, your daughters, and all your other women relatives too.  ""You'll need other women. Women always do.""

What a funny piece of advice!' the young woman thought. Haven't I just gotten married? Haven't I just joined the couple-world? I'm now a married woman, for goodness sake! A grownup! Surely my
husband and the family we may start will be all I need to make my life worthwhile!'

But she listened to her Mother. She kept contact with her Sisters and made more women friends each year. As the years tumbled by, one after another, she gradually came to understand that her Mom really knew what she was talking about. As time and nature work their changes and their mysteries upon a woman, Sisters are the mainstays of her life.

After more than 50 years of living in this world, here is what I've
learned. 

THIS SAYS IT ALL:
Time passes.
Life happens.
Distance separates.
Children grow up.
Jobs come and go.
Love waxes and wanes.
Men don't do what they're supposed to do.
Hearts break.
Parents die.
Colleagues forget favors.
Careers end.

BUT.........

Sisters are there, no matter how much time and how many miles are between you. A girl friend is never farther away than needing her can reach. When you have to walk that lonesome valley and you
have to walk it by yourself, the women in your life will be on the valley's rim, cheering you on, praying for you, pulling for you, intervening on your behalf, and waiting with open arms at the valley's end.
Sometimes, they will even break the rules and walk beside you...Or come in and carry you out.

Girlfriends, daughters, granddaughters, daughters-in-law, sisters, sisters-in-law, Mothers, Grandmothers, aunties, nieces, cousins, and extended family, all bless our life! The world wouldn't be the same
without women, and neither would I. When we began this adventure called womanhood, we had no idea of the incredible joys or sorrows that lay ahead. Nor did we know how much we would need each other. Every day, we
need each other still."

do which must be done, whether you like it or not. Being forced to
work, and forced to do your best, will breed in you a hundred virtues
which the idle never know."" ~ Charles Kingsley ~


""You simply will not be the same person two months from now after
consciously giving thanks each day for the abundance that exists in
your life. And you will have set in motion an ancient spiritual law:
the more you have and are grateful for, the more will be given you."" ~
Sarah Ban Breathnach ~ ""Simple Abundance""


Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you
concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have
enough.--Oprah Winfrey


If ""thank you"" is the only prayer you say, that will be
enough.--Meister Eckhart


Be Thankful
 Be thankful that you don't already have everything you desire,
 If you did, what would there be to look forward to?

 Be thankful when you don't know something
 For it gives you the opportunity to learn.

 Be thankful for the difficult times.
 During those times you grow.

 Be thankful for your limitations
 Because they give you opportunities for improvement.

 Be thankful for each new challenge
 Because it will build your strength and character.

 Be thankful for your mistakes
 They will teach you valuable lessons.

 Be thankful when you're tired and weary
 Because it means you've made a difference.

 It is easy to be thankful for the good things.
 A life of rich fulfillment comes to those who are
 also thankful for the setbacks.

 GRATITUDE can turn a negative into a positive.
 Find a way to be thankful for your troubles"

"event","Drinks Show Your Personality

Before you order a drink in public, you should read this!  Seven New York
City bartenders were asked if they could 'nail' a woman's personality based
on what she drinks.   Though interviewed separately, they concurred on
almost all counts.    The results:

PART A: WOMEN-DRINKS, WHO THEY ARE, & YOU!
Drink: Beer
Personality: Causal, low-maintenance; down to earth.
Your Approach: Challenge her to a game of pool.

Drink: Blender Drinks
Personality: Flaky, whiny, annoying; a pain in the ass.
Your Approach: Avoid her, unless you want to be her cabana boy.

Drink: Mixed Drinks
Personality: Older, more refined, high maintenance, has very picky taste;
knows EXACTLY what she wants.
Your Approach: You won't have to approach her. If she's interested, she'll
send YOU a drink..................

Drink: Wine (does not include White Zinfandel)
Personality: Conservative and classy; sophisticated yet giggles.
Your Approach: Tell her you love to travel and spend quiet evenings with
friends.

Drink: White Zinfandel
Personality: Easy; thinks she is classy and sophisticated, actually, she has
NO clue.
Your Approach: Make her feel smarter than she is...this should be an easy
target.

Drink: Shots
Personality: Likes to hang with frat-boy pals and looking to get
totally drunk... and naked.
Your Approach: Easiest hit in the joint. You have been blessed. Nothing to
do but wait, however, be careful not to make her mad!

Drink: Tequila
No explanations required - everyone just KNOWS what happens there.


PART B: MAN-DRINKS & WHO THE MEN ARE!
THEN, there is the MALE addendum -- The deal with guys is, as always, very
simple and clear cut:

Domestic Beer: He's poor and wants to get laid.

Imported Beer: He likes good beer and wants to get laid .

Wine:
He is hoping that the wine will give him a  sophisticated
image to help him get laid.

Whiskey: He doesn't give a damn about anything but getting laid.

Tequila: He is thinking he has a chance with the toothless waitress.

White Zinfandel: He's gay"

"event","Ok, so it looks like I haven't updated anything since last spring!! Well, too much has happened since then to ever make up for it, but here is the gist of it!  I AM A COLLEGE GRADUATE!! Yeah, so I actually did graduate in July and have my teaching license!! BUT, I'm not teaching which will be explained later.  So, after graduation Allen and I had been looking for a house and hadn't found one yet and he had to be out of his apartment so we moved into a duplex in Broadripple down in Indy literally on the day I graduated!! 

Oh, and I got a kitten right before that, named Duke and he is absolutely ADORABLE...so we living in Broadrippled for a couple months and I worked for the state as an FSSA Caseworker, then recently we moved into an AMAZING house on the East side of Indy and it makes no sense, but I am working for Charles Schwab in Fishers and really like it! So, in a nutshell, everything is absolutely perfect, I am so in love with the man of my dreams, we are living in the house of my dreams with our baby duke!! Ok, so maybe I still don't know what I am going to do with my life or future or where I even going to be working a few months from now, but I don't care...I can't worry forever, I am enjoying my amazing life as it comes at me and I am happy with that!! As for everything else, it will sort it's self out as it always does. 

Speaking of futures, my 3 best friends have their lives much more figured out than me! I was honored to be a maid of honor in Teens wedding this summer to Ty and a bridesmaid in Courtneys also this summer!! Then, this summer I will be a bridesmaid again when Crystal ties the knot with Curt! So happy for all my girls and their beautiful weddings, honeymoons and husbands! You know what they say, always a bridesmaid.......but, honestly, I LOVE being in weddings, you get to experience all the fun, dresses, girly stuff and be supportive to your best friends without the stress! Not to mention, the sheer excitement of being their when the most important people in my life are living out their dreams and moving on in the real world! 

So, that's what has been going on in my life the past 6 months or so...I'll try to update more often because I know God has only more amazing things in store for me....I am a lucky, lucky girl!

Here are some links to pictures of Duke and our house, they are also on Facebook! I am slowly updating more pictures all the time as we get more done around the house! Come visit!

KEITH URBAN LYRICS
""Making Memories Of Us""

I'm gonna be here for you baby
I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard
I wanna sleep with you forever
And I wanna die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us

I wanna honor your mother
I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention like a bad outlaw
I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men, I wanna make your world 
better than it's ever been


We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll be a new day
Comin' your way

I'm gonna be here for you from now on
This you know somehow
You've been stretched to the limits but 
it's alright now
And I'm gonna make you this promise
If there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to meet you with a warm, wet kiss

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us
I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll win your trust making memories of us



then thoughts on Allen approximately 30 seconds later...

Im not ready to back down
Im still mad as hell and
I dont have time to go round and round and round
Its too late to make it right
I probably wouldnt if I could
Cause Im mad as hell
Cant bring myself to do what it is you think I should
Forgive, sounds good
Forget, Im not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But Im still waiting"

Laughter to kiss your lips, 
Sunsets to warm your heart

Faith so that you can believe, 
Courage to know yourself, 
Patience to accept the truth, 
And love to complete your life. 
God Bless you! 

I asked the Lord to bless you. As I prayed for you today 
To guide you and protect you
As you go along your way.... 
His love is always with you
His promises are true 
No matter what the tribulation
You know He will see us through 
So, when the road you're traveling on
Seems difficult at best
Give your problems to the Lord
And God will do the rest."

"event","Wow, I haven't updated in forever! 
I am still with Allen!!
I survived student teaching at Frances Slocum in Marion!
I am working back at the library now while i finish up my last two classes of college before I graduate on July 22, 2006 :)
Most of my friends have already graduated or will be this coming weekend and teen is moving to Boston :(
I don't have a teaching job yet, but I am excited to have my own classroom in the fall.
I may have a job tutoring for $10 an hour this summer too, i def. need the money!
Yeah, my life is boring, i have nothing cool to talk about so i am going back to only posting quotes and stuff that i steal from other people on livejournal, that is much more interesting, i heart quotes."

"event","You begin to learn that kisses aren't a contract and presents arent promises. You begin to accept your defeats with your head up and eyes open. You learn to build all your roads on today because tomorrows ground is too uncertain. After a while, you learn that even sunshine burns if you get too much of it. So plant your own garden instead of waiting for somebody else to bring you flowers.

""Maybe our mistakes are what make our fate.  Without them, what would shape our lives?  Perhaps if we never veered off course, we wouldn't fall in love, or have babies, or be who we are.  After all, seasons change.  So do cities.  People come into your life and people go.  But it's comforting to know the ones you love are always in your heart.  And if you're lucky, a plane ride away.""

you just have to go after what you want & if it doesn't want you back then so be it...it probably doesn't deserve you anyways...

"event","A foolish man tells a woman to stop talking, but a wise man tells her that ""her mouth is extremely beautiful when her lips are closed"" 

Something in your voice called me, turned my head. 
Your smile captured me, you were in my future as far as I could see. 
And I dont know how it happened, but it happens still. 
...You won me, it was over from the start. 
You completely stole my heart, and now you won't let go. 
-kenny chesney, you had me from hello

""I'm not an alcoholic I just have a lot of problems and always have to drink them away.""

One day you're going to wake up and realize how much you love her. And when that day comes, she'll be waking up next to the guy who already knew.

After a while you learn the subtle difference between holding a hand and chaining a soul and you learn that love doesn't mean leaning and company doesn't mean security. And you begin to learn that kisses aren't contracts and presents aren't promises and you begin to accept your defeats with your head up and your eyes ahead with the grace of a woman, not the grief of a child
And you learn to build all your roads on today because tomorrow's ground is
Too uncertain for plans and futures have a way of falling down in mid-flight
After a while you learn that even sunshine burns if you get too much
So you plant your own garden and decorate your own soul instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers. And you learn that you really can endure you really are strong you really do have worth. With every good-bye, you learn. 


Why be a hard rock, when you could be a gem? ~Lauren Hill

people are going to hate you, love you, love to hate you, and hate to love you. but the ones you mean the most to will always be there.
- sex & the city

You have to take the good with the bad, smile with the sad, love what you got and remember what you had...always forgive, but never forget, learn from your mistakes, but never regret, people change, things go wrong, just remember...
LIFE GOES ON. 

mindy's away message: if you're a boy..then you suck...and you dont know anything..and i hate you. 

""Too many people worry about whether their glass is half empty or half full. As for me, I just drink whatever is in the glass!""
Golden Girls


I can't believe that someone like you exists...and that I have the honor to be able to even hold your hand.

To truly love something, you must first give it a chance to fail. If it survives, it is going to be stronger than ever. Distance is pure proof of this, and forever we will love if we survive.

Love: it's not in the falling, it's in the staying.

If you want to know where your heart is, look where your mind goes when it wanders 

Maybe our mistakes are what make our fate. Without them, what would shape our lives? Perhaps if we never veered off course, we wouldn't fall in love, or have babies, or be who we are. After all, seasons change. So do cities. People come into your life and people go. But it's comforting to know the ones you love are always in your heart. And if you're very lucky, a plane ride away.

""..if we had grown up in a culture where we were taught that fat thighs were beautiful, we'd all be pounding down milkshakes and cookies, lying on our backs, spending our days thigh-expanding..."" eve ensler

""I know it hurts. But it's life, and it's real. And sometimes it fucking hurts, but it's life, and it's pretty much all we got."" Sam in Garden State 

youre born, you die and in between you hope you have fun, thats all life is"" - Curt Hosier

What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us. 
~Ralph Waldo Emerson

Will I ever get to where I'm going? 
Will I ever follow through with what I had planned
I guess it's possible that I have been a bit distracted 
And the directions for me are a lot less in demand

Will I ever get to where I'm going? 
If I do, will I know when I am there? If the wind blew me in the right direction 
Would I even care? 
I would

I take a look around
It's evident the scene has changed
And there are times when I feel improved upon the past
Then there are times when I can't seem to understand at all and yes 
It seems as though I'm going nowhere... really fucking fast"

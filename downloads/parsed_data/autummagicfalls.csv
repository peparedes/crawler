sighs are nurtured and set free,
it's poetry in motion of the ocean that lyes in between,
if playing cards i were a pack i would remove my suit of black,

tis now good friday. this day a one of those yearly markers that you suddenly
see, bringing up thoughts of the year before. last year Sair and I went to new farm
park with a bunch of folks, drank red wine, gin, beer and took bickies and acid. it all ended in a blur of intoxication & group sex. just one of those days i will look back at with a smile. 

So today we are going back to the park, to celebrate jesus's death the only way we care for,
with booze & friends. :)
 i grabbed a bottle of sapphire for Sair, 3 wines & a case of crap beer for the stragglers who might be eying off my nice red (rockbare shiraz, yum).

i am so in love with Sarah right now. she is asleep in the bedroom, passed out. she called at work from the pub asking me to come over, that everyone kept trying to talk to her but she only wanted to talk to me. she was asleep, couch-ridden, when i arrived but that was cool, i performed the ritual 'carry-to-bed' . i love carrying her to bed & she loves it too. i think it is an act of pure love, free from sex, convenience, obligation. 

selfless. it's a nice word to say aloud.   

it's amazing. i have loved her for a long time but now it feels different. is it an appreciation? perhaps, absence does makes the heart grow fonder, but it feels something so much more profound than that. its a feeling that is always with me, effecting everything. it scares the shit out of me. i feel that i have no control.
i now remember hearing that real love is about letting go of all fear and embrace love. throwing one self over the cliff, into the fire, into the ball pit etc.......
to be together when it's good is breath taking, being without her really let me see how alone everybody is (i am). what we have is unique and is so worth the fight.
 i feel like sometimes the world and it's people are predatory, stalking us down but i know that is bull shit, it is an 'i am a victim' comfort caller. we are responsible for we. i feel like i have grown so much in the last four months. i've grown an obsession for tequila, grown an understanding of universal nature.
i feel i have grown more vunerable then ever."

"event","i read a friends journal <lj user=""veruca13""> about an aternoon storm and was insired to comment. it started as comment but it turned into a page long rant. cheers.

what do we see when we watch a dark storm cross the horizon? i know some people see a foreboding offensive from god/nature, an attack on the land, something to be feared. i guess others see it a just as it effects them there and then (hail! not on my vespa!). meteorologists see it before it gets here and to a few house pets it's a reason to shit on the couch.

i like to take it as a time for reflection. a time to sit, look above and see a reflection of the storm within. it can put me into a meditative state.

the rain might grow a seedling thought into action, the wind may blow free a veils of confusion, or add other debris. lightning my strike your house and blow up your tv, leaving you time to write more.

it's funny how we humans enjoy such juxtaposition of different energies. be it the view of empty air up against a cliff face, a ravaging storm crossing a virgin sky, or the edge of the pacific lapping the coast. 
sometimes it's spell binding to watch the city wake up over a coffee. the traffic of people, ebbing in the beginning, then opening up in to a torrent of energy. Cooperating yet not, together yet separate, important and irrelevant.
everyone wants a good view of something."

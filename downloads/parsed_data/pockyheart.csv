"event","If you call someone a bitch, they can't speak out to justify their opinion, because then they'll seem more of a ""bitch.""
Nor can they simply stay quiet, because then they're subsiding to the perpretrator.
The best you could possibly due is walk away, but still.
There must be some form of passive resistence that I've looked over.
And what if you're being called a bitch, behind your back?
What do you do then?

Odd thing I heard today. There were these girls, making fun of someone because of the way they laughed.
It's sad to think there's someone out there who hates your laugh, just because it doesn't sound ""right,"" or ""cool.""
Would you rather hear them cry?
Would you rather make them cry?

Strange thing I heard today. So there's this girl chasing after a guy who just broke up with his GF.
She's been calling the GF a jerkface and shiet.
Then the GF goes up to the girl and says she hopes she doesn't hate her.
Haha. The girl says the GF is so nice, and never spoke to her a word before she met her.

Why do people judge you before they get to know you?
Please don't tell me that you don't need to know a person before you can decide whether you like or dislike someone.
Please don't tell me that you don't decide to like or dislike someone, that you just ""feel"" it.
If you've no reason, why are you still hating?
If you've a reason, is it really a sensible one?

This is what I listened to all day.&nbsp;
And I didn't like what I heard.
Hey, try it.&nbsp;
Sit down in class and don't say anything.
And you might hear it too."

Keisha, Claudia and I decorated her locker this morning.
With wrapping paper, ribbon, and anime pictures.

Today I received a rose.
However I suspect that it's already dying on me.

Hey hey.

Had a science quiz today.
OPEN BOOK.
Hopefully it'll bring up my mark.
'Cause I got 74% on the last 2 quizzes.
And a 70% on my Chem. lab.
And my midterm was 86%.
Fuck Science.

Current Addictions: Loveholic, The Spill Canvas, Gazette.
Yeah. Korean pop, Western Acoustic and Japanese Visual Rock.
Hee hee.

I'm not really into writing much anymore.
Using long sentences and the like.
There's mere content in stringing words together uselessly.
My thoughts don't run as far.

But I write in my journal daily.
So if you see me scribbling in a blue notebook, don't come near.
I'm more distracted with it then with class work.
Maybe that's why my grades are dropping.

"event","<p>Today I put all my clean laundry into a basket and let it sit in the corner of my room for about half the day. By the end when I dumped out all my clothes onto my bed they were of course, wrinkled and stretched. I thought, ""Hey, this is a great time to bust out an iron,"" and that's exactly what I did.<br /><br />It took me half an hour to find it at first. My mom and dad had went out to go buy groceries so I couldn't ask where it was. Then I dragged it all the way to my room, put on some Loveholic (korean band) and switched on the iron.&nbsp;<br /><br />I kid you not, I suck at ironing. I touched the hot metal plate more than once and I'm surprised the flesh on my hand hasn't melted away or something. My shirts came out more wrinkled then before, even if I turned them inside out and ironed the other side. Ironing is some damn tricky business I tell you. After attemping to iron about five articles of clothing, and hour had passed, I was getting sore and decided to stop.&nbsp;<br /><br />So my next goal to accomplish is ironing. Which comes after finishing a story, making 1000 paper cranes and stars, and a few others random shit you don't even care about.<br /><br />Tomorrow is the Xmas party. Oh yeah. It'll be my family and a bunch of other families, with beer an alcohol. How lovely.</p>"

"event","This Christmas my family is going away for 10 days. We usually sgo on vacations&nbsp;during the holidays. My parents exclaim that this'll be the last few years until David and I got to University so they're attempting to cram in some family time. Ugh.

School ends for the holidays at the end of December 22nd. However, no one really goes to school on the last day before vacations anyways. I'll be leaving at 3am on the 22nd, so I won't have to bother with the non existent classes.&nbsp; 

We plan on driving down to New Orleans and staying there for a night (2days). We will be going with my Uncle's family (mother's side) which includes my Uncle, Aunt, Andy and Sandy (Vietnamese people love rhyming names). Afterwards, we will take a flight to Las Vegas and stay there for&nbsp;(3 days). Afterwards, we will take another flight, this one to Las Angeles, and stay there for (3 days). Then we intend on flying back to New Orleans, and driving back (2days). 

This year, I plan on buying a Santa Clause hat. Yes, the red cap with a white fluffy pom pom at the end. They're freaking cute. David wants one too. So we've made a goal to get them this year, and wear them on Christmas. Haha. We're strange. 

Yesterday I bought a new type of Pocky. Normally I just buy the ones that have chocolate, but the one I bought had almond and chocolate. It was expensive too, $3.99, but it was hella good. I'm going to buy crushed almond chocolate Pocky from now on whenever I can and have the chance to. 

Funny thing that happened with the cafe ladies the other day. Kathleen bought 2 fudge cookies ($1) and handed them a $10 bill. However they gave her back $19. LOL. I've been getting Kathleen to buy me lunches all week. I really am a glutton. Although I should probably go back to eating my, as we say, ""healthy"" sandwiches and bagels. 

Hm. Nah. 

I've been craving chocolate like mad now. It's so good.&nbsp;I remember reading up about something that said eating chocolate can make people feel good. I agree."

"event","<p>I must first begin this entry with one of the biggest disappointments of my life. <br /><br />Last night we ordered Chinese take-out for dinner. I asked my mother to bring home sweet 'n sour pork, because it's my favourite dish. While opening the containers, I was thouroughly shocked. They had the pork covered in flour alright, but the sauce was SEPERATE! You couldn't believe my astonishment. It tasted like crap. Damn Canadianized Chinese food. What makes it worse was that it was apparently 7$. SEVEN BUCKS for a tiny container of CRAP. I continued emoing three hours afterwards. <br /><br />Today, in search of a Frou Frou CD, Joseph and I headed to the mall. Seeing as I live approximately 15 minutes away from the mall, walking seemed suitable. On the way you have to cross through the Canadian Tire parking lot into the Sears one. In between there's a hill, grass and all. I had failed to observe it had snowed earlier today, and you can guess what happened. I slipped. Fortunately I didn't fall face first. Unfortunately, that was embarassing haha. Mind you, I was much more concerned about the camera, because I was carrying my Dad's 7.1 megapixel. And if a) he found out I took it without asking and/or b) he found out I slipped in the mud and it was horrible then I'd be in shit. Anyways 4 hours later this is what my jeans look like. <br /><br />Front Side <br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/6589/4rv2.jpg"" /> <br /><br />Back Side <br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/250/3aq8.jpg"" /> <br /><br />Back Pocket <br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img489.imageshack.us/img489/7885/5tr0.jpg"" /> <br /><br />So at the mall when we got there I tried cleaning the case, although it didn't really help. I got alot of weird stares too. Whether it's because I was all muddy or I was cleaning a camera case, I really don't know. Some people inquired, some others just stared strangely. Freaking busybodies. <br /><br />We went into Sunrise and couldn't find Frou Frou. Then we headed to Music World, I was pretty sure it wouldn't be there but low and behold, it was. Joseph bought it, I wouldn't take it, so he exchanged it for Damien Rice. I went to the food court, got napkins at New York Fries, and afterwards the camera case was CLEAN. <br /><br />Then headed to HMV, bought nothing, but Joseph got Broken Social Scene and Death From Above 1979.<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/3995/2sr9.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /></p>"

It's recently come to my attention that the very word ""sympathy"" or ""pity"" has now become&nbsp;a degrading term. But I am here to tell you it simply is not.<br /><br />The very word sympathy means, in essence, to be compassionate. When we are sympathising, or pitying, we take in the sorrow, pain, and suffering of others and try our best to treat it as our own. Sometimes we can, because we've faced a similiar tragedy in the past, and sometimes we can't. We're not looking down at you when we tell you ""I'm sorry."" We're not thinking any less of you when we say that. Everyone unconsiously seeks out sympathy. So please don't sit there, whining, telling us that you don't want it, because we all know perfectly well that you'll call us uncompassionate bitches if we don't.<br /><br />This goes out to all those children who cry thereselves to sleep tonight. Who clutch their heads in bed, and scream to the world while no one's listening. To the children who laugh but no sound is heard. To the children who cry and no sound is made.

She left to go to the washroom, and when she came back I said ""I'm having a hell of a time pretending I'm doing my work when I'm really not,"" and she replied with a ""I know, you're quite good at that."" 

Honestly, if you ever have a class with me, you'll hate me by the end of Week 1. I do not do my work in class. Exceptions go to if I'm going out in the afternoon and don't want to be up until 11pm doing homework, but normally I slack off. I sit there, doodle, talk to whoever is sitting beside me, distract THEM from THEIR work and we've got a combination for disastor.&nbsp; 

Next semester I have Math (Vander Doelen), Computer Sciences (Walker), Art (Vanhouten) and History (Warecki), along with Lunch C and B. Anyone have anything with me =D ? This'll be a great way to know who I can bother when Semester 2 starts x] 

So afterschool today Shannon, Kathleen and I decided to stay and do absolutely nothing with our time. We didn't really feel like going&nbsp;home, so we decided to just go outside and talk in the blazing sunshine. Joseph wandered over, he was supposed to be at Spirit Council but I suppose he ditched and had nothing better to do with his time. We all ended up walking to the Korner Store and buying junk food. On the way back Caroline was walking with Melissa to Main Street and I stopped to say hello. Afterwards we all went home. 

When I got home I got a horrible migraine, hurried to finish washing the dishes and fell asleep until 8pm. I would have simply slept longer, however David and John were yelling in the next room and I could hear them screeching like a bunch of banshees. While I was awake, I was much too tired to get up, so I did nothing but lie there and think. It's a terrible thing for me, really. Usually at school when I'm around others my mind's pretty blank and I'm either not talking or just too numb to talk. But when I'm by myself I tend to think alot, about life, school, friends, everything in general. Sometimes I get really pessimistic with my thinking, like I did today. Is that a bad thing? Yeah. But hey, I get insane writing ideas from this type of thinking. 

Although I don't think anyone is into pointless teen angst stories.&nbsp; 

Not that anyone is even interested in my boring bloggage (yes there's a few, but it's hard to tell). I have a link on my myspace to my LJ, and all my friends know about it, yet they can't be bothered with taking a few minutes to read it. What if I bullshitted about them here? Well you know that's exactly what I'm gonna do. 

It's damned annoying to always be a confession stand. Sure, it's wonderful that I can hear about other people's problems and TRY to console them, but then when it becomes the other way around they don't act interested at all. Even regular shit. For example, a friend will call me up and tell me about how his/her day was shit and stuff, and then afterwards when I try and tell him/her about something that happened in class or afterschool or whatever, they reply with a ""Ohh alright..."" and then switch back to their over-dramatic gossip. You know what? I don't care about your life. And if you were me, you wouldn't either. I guess sometimes I just act interested out of curiousity and to be polite, but most of the time I'll go to bed that night and forget about it the next morning. 

Sometimes I wonder if I even have anything in common with these people. I probably don't, we're pretty much the opposite in every single way. I wish they were somewhat more mellow, I mean we're in high school. In a few more years, you're going to be off doing whatever you want with your life and everything that you know now that's so horrible will make a 360 degrees turnaround. Right now, you may want to ""live in the moment,"" but really, be more laid back and mellow. Is it really worth ranting about? 

I know I'm an obvious hypocrite right here and now. [sarcasm] I guess I'm just a heartless, inconsiderate bitch whose too insensitive and lazy to even bother with other people and their lives. [/sarcasm] 

Haha sweet."

"event","<p>Last night I went out and saw Borat with my buddies Shannon and Laura. I got there, spent nearly 10 minutes trying to find them, found them, bought a ticket and we headed in. Once we got into the theater, we noticed it was packed. There were no seats, so we ended up sitting near the front. I saw hella lots of people whom I knew from school. Shannon left for a few minutes while the previews were still playing to go get popcorn &amp; a drink. Once she came back the popcorn was gone when it wasn't even halfway through the movie due to the fact that we all lunged for it x]<br /><br />Borat is a funny movie, I'll give you that. But it's not MY type of humour. I know plenty of people in the theater were laughing, but I only found some parts funny. And, honestly, maybe you think it's hilarious but two hairy naked men rolling around on a bed is not my cup of tea.<br /><br />Once the movie was over, Shannon and I got a ride to my house and she slept over. I was knocked out cold 'cause I was dead tired, and fell asleep around 12:30am. Shannon on the other hand was on msn, and had an enjoyable time going on webcam to show people that I was sleeping like a dead pig. Wonderful, thanks Shannon.<br /><br />This morning Shannon's mom came and picked her up, and I got ready to go to the Pacific Mall with Natalie. I was going to bring the camera but since David was going to ImportFest that was somewhat difficult. Finally after getting there, we shopped around for a bit, bought Pocky, origami star paper and some random stuffs, then got home around 6pm.<br /><br />Tomorrow I'm planning to go to Elizabeth's house, but hey I guarantee you my mother will not allow me to. So instead I'm going to have to either figure out how to take public transit, or, walk there.<br /><br />I have a Science unit test on Monday on chemistry, so I'm off to study.</p>"

That's my VIP ticket from last night.<br /><br />So around noon after having lunch, Mom, Dad and me made our way to Mississauga. We got our tickets, and sat in 4th row and started watching since it already started. I got to see Adam Ho (talented guy), Kristine Sa, Trish (great as always) and many others. Partway through it I left the concert and went into the main room to buy food. I bought chips and then headed back, but then saw Chris's parents standing on the sidelines watching the concert. Mom and I said hello, and we waited until Chris came back because apparently he was looking for me. Well he came eventually, we wandered around watching the singers sign autographs and the food stands, then I ditched him and went to watch more music.<br /><br />After a comedy act, a few more local singers and their ballads, I went into the VIP lobby. There were a team of break dancers practising for their act, so I stood there watching them. They were hella good,&nbsp;I must say! =D<br /><br />Then there was a one hour break, so I went and hung with Chris. Him and his parents were squatted in the corner, asian-style HAHA.. If you ever to go to Vietnam you'll know what I mean ;D Mom made me introduce myself to her friends, they complimented me on how ""tall"" I've grown (well geez<em>&nbsp; </em>I wonder why considering I last saw them when I was 8).&nbsp;<br /><br />Funny thing happened next. I was eating my chips and Chris said ""Geez they have real food!?"" So I gave him the rest of my chips, I leave for a bit and then come back and his mom says ""Chris, you ate all of Tammy's chips! Go buy her another one!"" AHAHAH... And she turns to me and says ""Tammy, if you want to eat anything just tell Chris to buy it for you."" LOL so I got some more free fooodd &gt;:0<br /><br />Intermission was over, watched Quang Le, a comedy act (really funny), and the breakdancers!

Fucking boring like every other! 

Went to YAC, helping out at the bake sale next week and then the sharing fair the week after, all for the sake of community service hours. 

Today when I went home, I started cooking my dinner. My mom opens the fridge door and the bottle of orange juice drops on the floor. She kicks it to the side, gets her bowl of water and eggplants and walks over to the sink. By this point I'm sitting in my chair eating, and then she starts yelling, telling me to pick up the bottle of orange juice, 

""You kicked it over there, why can't you pick it up?"" 

""If you see something lying on the ground, pick it up!"" 

""Right, so when you go in my room, you're going to pick up all my things and clean it for me?"" 

And because I want to go to Cecilia to Chinatown next Saturday for her birthday, she's making me get proof that it's her birthday. SHE apparently doesn't ""trust"" me, thinking I'm going to be going out doing some stupid shit. 

I feel fucking lame asking someone for proof that it's their birthday. 

And afterwards I even have to ask my Dad if I can even go. So I might as well not even go at all. 

""We only care soo much about you, because you're a girl. We don't care at all about your brothers."" 

Right, so you're an ignorant negligent parent, and your sexist.&nbsp;

"event","Do you ever walk down the halls of your high school, look around and just <b>see</b> how so many people are so utterly <i>shallow</i>? You may shake your head and say no, and claim that there are many ugly people hanging out with very ""cool"" people. Well there you go, another shallow statement.

Ever realize how our perception of what's ""cool,"" is so utterly distorted? That an outgoing, pretty person is automatically popular and we should befriend them? Why is it that certain people think that if they hang out with this person or that person, that it'll make ""you"" seem cooler? That despite our hideous appearances we'll automatically be liked because we hang out with that person?

Yes, I know. Appearance draws people in, personality makes them stay. But if you think about it, everyone has a unique personality, which leaves the appearance.

There are many common misconceptions. 

1) If you're pretty, you'll be popular
2) If you're popular, you'll have more friends

Honestly, spending all your time trying to look pretty won't make you ""popular."" Popularity doesn't even <i>exist</i>. And having more friends doesn't mean anything, ever heard of ""quality over quantity?"" You shouldn't degrade the value of friends for the sake of having as many as possible.

So some people are outgoing, and they talk a bit more. So some people are shy, and talk less. Some personalities click well with others, while some don't. 

And just because people don't like you, it doesn't mean you have to change to fit their expectations. You'll have much more fun just enjoying yourself without having to try and please others. 

Alright, it's nice to dress up, look nice. 

But it's better to just be yourself. It looks cooler."

I forgot my lunch at home, so I borrowed $2.50 from Cecilia. Yes, fries are now $2.50, wth is this? Not only is cafe food so disgustingly overpriced, the portions are pretty much half of what they used to be. Then when I was at my locker, I noticed I had pocky in my bag. How stupid am I? How could I have forgotten the pocky =( ?

I switched my speech topic to Media Influence, because the one I have now on the pointlessness of teen angst is much too harsh (I encourage those who think life sucks to jump off a bridge). Then Friday I have a Religion project do, it's a gospel writing assignment and I'm supposed to write about 6 moments in my life when God was present. *sigh* 

On November 4th(?) I am possibly going to a Vietnamese Concert, that is if Chris's mom calls my mom and talks to her about it. I actually hate these things, but I guess it'll be fun to wander around when there's someone there I actually know.

I am still addicted to Gazette, and I could honestly care less what anyone says about them =)"

"event","<p>Everyone who is reading this blog at this very second, you<em> MUST</em> and I emphasize<font size=""2""> MUST</font><font size=""3""> </font>go download <strong>Reila </strong>by <u>Gazette</u>. It's been on repeat on my iTunes all day, and I'm completely in love with the song. I watched the music video and performance for it over and over. Trust me, it'll be the best 7 minutes for your eears &lt;3333 By the way, it's JROCK. Absolutely amazing JROCK.<br /><br />So today I had alot of homework, and I still didn't finish it all.<br /><br /><strong>Religion</strong> - Work on Gospel Writing Assignment<br /><strong>English</strong> - Write Speech &amp; Memorize<br /><strong>Science</strong> - pg. 228 # 1 - 5, pg. 229 # 1 - 4<br /><strong>Civics</strong> - Article of Journal, Prepare for Debate<br /><br />I was supposed to go to the mall today and buy Alex and Kathleen their birthday presents, but I got side tracked with watching the Gazette clips and listening to the songs. For Kathleen, I'm thinking of simply just buying her a CD from Alexisonfire, since she really likes them. For Alex, I was going to buy him a CD as well, but then it turned out to be 21.99$, and besides it'd make more sense if Joseph bought a CD for him anyways. So I'm thinking of buying him a nice sweater, seeing as he's always so freaking cold outside in the mornings.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have been working so hard at school this year, I feel as if I'm really trying 0_0 My notes are loadds neater, and my binders still have their covers in tact and all. I've studied for all of my tests unlike last year, but hell, I'm doing ALOT worse? Does that make any sense? Last year I got 86% in Science, and now I'm only scraping up an 83%. Not to mention, I didn't do so well on my last Religion test and since we've only had that one test all semester, that's probably going to be my midterm mark. With Civics, my teacher says my grade only ranges between high 70's and low 80's. I can't believe I'm doing so horrible in my courses, maybe I need to try harder T_T; If I get lower than 85% average midterm (that is if I even friggen get an 80% average) then I'm going to scream -_-; I can't stand getting 70's! Gahh...</p>"

"event","Yes yes, so I've been really neglecting my livejournal, but now I'm here to post about my day! 

So this morning they played ""What I'm Trying To Say,"" by Stars on the P.A. For those of you who don't know, Stars is a great indie band and I was so happy they played semi-good music, instead of their commercialized shit. I hope next time they play Saosin or Emery though, that'd really make my day 8D 

Okay so the other afternoon I got on the wrong bus. I sat on the bus, then saw a bunch of random people boarding it, and I'm thinking, ""Uhm, wtf?"" So I get off the bus, and I see my bro and this 12th grader getting onto my real bus. I was so surprised, I went back to get my bag, but then tripped on the stairs, how humiliating &gt;_&lt;; I got my backpack, got on my real bus and luckily got a seat. 

This afternoon I was supposed to stay afterschool to watch Shannon's rugby game but then it started raining. I didn't wanna stick around so I went home. 

Tomorrow I'm staying afterschool to join YAC (Youth Awareness Council) with Joesph and possibly Alex and Kathleen. Hopefully it'll be fun =X Right after that I have to go home, get my materials for the science project and head to Victoria's to work on it. 

Ah since I only work at Pho Saigon when they really need help, Shannon and I are going to apply at Swiss Chalet once she quits at Toppers. Hopefully we'll both get jobs =)"

"event","Yesterday I went to Wonderland with John, Chris and his friend Sam. We got there around 2pm and left around 7pm, so we didn't exactly fit in too many rides. We basically just went into the ones where there was almost no huge lines.&nbsp; 

At lunch had a poutine from New York Fries, i only finished half of it. We noticed that the seagulls were surrounding us, so John took my poutine, left it at the top of the hill and we stood there watching. A whole bunch of birds starting pecking at each other for the fries, and within a few seconds the paper container was rolling down the hill like a wheel, completely empty LOL. It was hilarious. 

Sam kind of ditched us and decided it would be funner for him to watch people try the electric chair at the arcade. So the rest of us went on Dragonfire &amp; Cliffhanger. I knocked my head against the seat on Cliffhanger (ow), and decided I was going to sit out for the next ride. John felt sick after riding The Rage (who the hell makes up these gay names) and so we both sat out while Chris and Sam went on The Spinnovator (the teacups haha). 

Oh they had the Nickelodeon Parade while we were there. We had to jump over people to get through because everyone was on the sidelines watching. Chris said his friend Paul wanted to hug Patrick (that pink thing from Spongebob)&nbsp; but the parade would be over by tomorrow. So Chris was going to hug Patrick himself. Too bad he chickened out. 

At the end of the day John got this expensive cotton candy ($3.99, wtf?) and we went home. A whole bunch of other shit happened that day but I can't really remember. I forgot to bring my camera, damnit."

"event","<div><font face=""Tahoma,Helvetica,Sans-Serif"" size=""1"">Yesterday I had Vietnamese School, quite boring, uneventful. English class was pointless, I don't even need to go (86% english), but due to transportation inconvienences, I have to take it. During break I went to Shell and bought some candy, and chewed it loudly in annoyance. Obviously the teacher noticed I wasn't paying attention, &amp; decided to call my name out. Or at least what she thought was my name. She looked straight at me and yelled, ""Anne, Anne, <strong>ANNE</strong>!"" I pretended I was listening to my music, then took out an earplug and said ""I'm not Anne. That's the girl over there -_-;."" Anne laughed nervously and I looked at my teacher stupidly. I answered her damned questions about literary terms and their meanings though.</font></div><br /><div><font face=""Tahoma"" size=""1"">Lunch finally rolled around, and David, John and Me went and ate at Buzz Buzz Pizza. The pizza there is so good, I love eating there. Unfortunately for me, some of the boys from my english class were sitting in there and it ruined my whole lunch. Could I not be rid of these idiots for even an hour?! John's lunch period finished, and me and David went, sat outside and talked for about 20 minutes to waste time. We went to class, died for the next 3 hours and finally we were finished at 5pm.</font></div><br /><div><font face=""Tahoma"" size=""1"">Next we had our optometrist appointment. The office dude asked if I was in my last year of high school. I looked at him and told him that I'm younger than David. He shrugged saying I look more mature. HAHA.</font></div><div><font size=""1""></font></div><div><font size=""1""><font face=""Tahoma"">I went to get my eyes tested, turns out only my right eye has gotten worse, and only by a little. New glasses weren't necessary, so that was also a good sign. Then afterwards she wanted to check the pressure in my eyes, gave me some eye drops that stung. Then this plastic tube thing was meant to touch my eye, but I kept blinking and she only exceeded examining one of my eyes. Ah well, next time I suppose. </font><font face=""Tahoma"">We walked over the Saigon Optical, me and John picked out new glasses and David got his 6 months worth of contacts and one year supply of solution. Afterwards we ate at my favourite seafood restaurant, Xam Yu Seafood (it's at the intersection of Baldwin Street and Spadina Avenue). Crab &amp; Lobster ^^;;</font></font></div><div><font face=""Tahoma,Helvetica,Sans-Serif""></font><font size=""1"">&nbsp;<hr /> </font></div><br /><div><font face=""Tahoma,Helvetica,Sans-Serif"" size=""1"">So for the entry on today, I'd like to start if off with,</font></div><br /><div><font size=""1"">HAPPY BIRTHDAY SHANNON!</font></div><br /><div><font face=""Tahoma"" size=""1"">Now're you're fucking 15 bitch -_-; And by the way, you'll never, ever be able to guess my birthday =) So quit it. </font></div><br /><div><font size=""1""><font face=""Tahoma"">Moving along, I woke up this morning around 10am. I got ready, then Mom dropped me off at the mall and me and Shannon walked from there to the bus station. We found out that we missed the bus, and we'd have to wait another half hour for the next one. So then we took a taxi, effing taxi driver was a cheapass</font><font face=""Tahoma"">, he took the long way and it ended up being $10.</font></font></div><br /><div><font face=""Tahoma"" size=""1"">We arrived at Cora's, the line was out the door. Waited a bit and finally got a table. No one else showed so we ate our waffles (Banana and Chocolate Hazelnut, which was so sweet!) and finally called Claudia. Figures, she had completely forgotten about coming, and she was on her way. She ordered a plain waffle, ate half, then we paid and left. In that time period, Shannon told me I didn't know how to eat with a fork properly (because I hold it like a pencil, when it's supposed to be parallel to the way you hold your knife). I told her I'm ASIAN. That I'm a chopsticks person. Hah, that was my lame excuse.</font></div><br /><div><font face=""Tahoma"" size=""1"">We walked over to InPlay and Shannon played DDR. I shadowed her because I'm poor, and because of other reasons, and I got tired/bored. I told her I was going outside to cool down, and me and Claudia snuck into the dollar store and bought her presents. We came back, with 3 boas (black, white, red), a powerpuff Bubbles balloon, a little plastic tiara, and&nbsp;kanji style&nbsp;temporary tatoos. We all wore a random boa and walked down the street, surprisingly not dying from damned embarassment =)</font></div><br /><div><font face=""Tahoma"" size=""1"">I called my Mom to come pick me up, while Claudia &amp; Shannon went into the one of the cosmetic stores. I went home, but 10-20 minutes after Claudia and Shannon showed up at my door, dragged me out and said we were going to Claudia's.</font></div><br /><div><font face=""Tahoma"" size=""1"">Well we arrived there 5 minutes later, and sat at the kitchen table. We had some alcohol, only a little in shot glasses. Personally I didn't like it, I generally do not like alcohol (Shannon says I don't have a ""taste"" for it). I've only had alcohol once before, and even now I still don't like it much. Claudia's mom was really nice, asking if I needed water/juice or something lol, but I said it's alright.</font></div><br /><div><font face=""Tahoma""><font size=""1"">We went upstairs and Shannon wanted to go on msn so she could talk to Cam. I asked Claudia if I could use her camera (4.1 megapixel) and she said alright. Turns out I went a little crazy and took ALOT of pictures. Only reason I didn't upload much is because more then half turned out weird and I deleted them. <br /></font><p><font size=""1"">-pic removed-<br /></font></p><p><font size=""1"">Shannon's on msn, talking to Cam and people</font></p><br /><p><br /><br /><font size=""1"">-pic removed-<br /></font></p><p><font size=""1"">Mirror shot, with Claudia giving me bunny ears! .__.;;</font></p><br /><p><br /><br /><font size=""1"">-pic removed-<br /></font></p><p><font size=""1"">I don't know, Shannon just turned around and gave me that face</font></p><br /><p><br /><br /><font size=""1"">-pic removed-<br /></font></p><p><font size=""1"">I spent like 10 minutes trying to take this picture, and it still didn't come out right</font></p><br /><p><br /><br /><font size=""1"">-pic removed-<br /></font></p><p><font size=""1"">Claudia got bored and posed with moi &gt;:0</font></p><br /><p><br /><br /><font size=""1"">-pic removed-<br /></font></p><p><font size=""1"">Claudia &amp; Shannon with their lovely boas o:</font></p><br /><p><br /><br /><font size=""1"">-pic removed-<br /></font></p><p><font size=""1"">And again, posing with their boas~</font></p><br /><p><br /><br /><font size=""1"">-pic removed-<br /></font></p><p><font size=""1"">Claudia &amp; Shannon wrapped them around my head and made fun of me; ignore my chipped nail polish, imma re-paint them later</font></p><br /><p><br /><br /><font size=""1"">-pic removed-<br /></font></p><p><font size=""1"">I was fixing my hair and Shannon took a picture ahah</font></p><br /><p><br /><br /><font size=""1"">-pic removed-<br /></font></p><p><font size=""1"">More boa!

I went on the computer to upload the pictures to my freewebs account, while they went into the washroom to start dying her hair. Claudia dyed her hair blue, and Shannon dyed hers copper. Shannon also put a streak into my hair but I didn't like it and washed it out. Shannon didn't like her copper hair and washed hers out too. Afterwards, Claudia asked me which one of the tatoos looked nice and I pointed to one, before I knew it she was cutting them out and she stuck one on me with Shannon pressing the cloth down on my neck X__x; But I like it, it looks nice tee hee. Claudia put one on her shoulder and Shannon one on her neck. They're all kanji, mine is cheerful, Shannon's is&nbsp;spicy, Claudia's is fight =P (I took pictures through the whole thing, but until Claudia gets on msn I can't post them up yet). <br /></font></p><p><font size=""1"">Shannon soon realized she got copper dye all over her top, so her and Claudia walked over to the mall to go buy a new one (after doing all their makeup and shit which took forever!) I went home, took a shower and ate some rice w/soya sauce 'cause I didn't have time to cook something up. The two later arrived at my house, and my Mom drove us over to the movies.<br /></font></p><p><font size=""1"">As it turns out, the only people who ended up going was me, Claudia, Shannon, Laura, Kiera, Cecilia, Nadine, Chelsea and Angela. Initially, we were going to go see Miami Vice, but the movie was rated 14A. Seeing as everyone didn't have ID, we decided to go see Devil Wears Prada. While walking in I saw Natalie Martins (a girl from my art &amp; gym class) and we talked to her for a bit before finally going into the movie. Nadine kept throwing popcorn at Claudia throughout the whole movie (and I was sitting beside Claudia), finally at the end Nadine threw all her popcorn at her, missed, while I narrowly evaded the whole thing. Claudia ran out of the movie, leaving her half full gigantic sized drink and popcorn bag.<br /></font></p></font></div><br /><div><font size=""1""><font face=""Tahoma"">Cecilia and I played only one game of DDR, and then everyone else played. Chelsea and Angela had to go get picked up, so we stood outside. Nadine tried giving&nbsp;Shannon a piggyback ride, then they both fell on the ground haha. Once they got picked up, everyone else headed over to Manchu Wok for an extremely late dinner. They didn't have much food left, so only a few people ordered. Finishing their food, Laura and Kiera were getting picked up at the place (with Shannon waiting with them), while Cecilia, Claudia and me headed back to the theater. I went to New York Fries and bought a poutine, then Claudia's dad drove me and her back home.<br /></font><br /></font></div><div><font size=""1""><font face=""Tahoma"">I ate half my poutine in the kitchen before finally&nbsp;throwing it out, I'd never be able to finish one of those *sigh* I'm really tired right now, but I had an overall pretty good day. </font><font face=""Tahoma"">But you know what sucks? I could have gone to the Pacific Mall today! But Chris's Dad couldn't find my friggen house grr &gt;_&lt;; Pacific Mall is this Chinese mall that has this amazing anime/manga store, and POCKY &lt;3 Haha oh well, there's always next time.</font></font><font face=""Tahoma""><br /></font></div>"

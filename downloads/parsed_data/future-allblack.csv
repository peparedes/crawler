"event","well third time lucky... and this is about anything that comes to me head..which is good cause yeah i got alot of space of nothing in me head so alot of this will be about space.

Space is said to be about hte final thngy for man kind.  Which is like prolly aye, cause like no one knows what else is out there, so yeah maybe like there is puter space is the final frontier or something, cause like there is space that is close to Earth, which could be called space that is close to Earth.  Then there is the space that is like really far away from Earth, what can i call that.... i know i should call that...dot..na better yet, OP...our place wat the aliens would say...lol fuck im funny.  yeah space is like weird because apparently there is no other life form out there in our galaxy, the mily way, did ya know that... yeah there is like a heap of thngs out there... i hope so, cause like that would really suck if humans on Earth that they are the only ones that are living in here.  Like we have superman, aka clarck kent aka some other person aka prolly someone else...yeah i like superman, yeah for like a ages aye like him and batman, batman more because he is better cause he is human.  

yeah super heros are cool.  i member when i was a kid i use to pretend that i was like batman, or superman or spiderman, even a power ranger... Like it was cool when i was like 10 - 7 i cant member and yeah climbing trees...best thing is to do is a clib a tree...like u could get up there and you think that you where on top of the world well at least close enough... because when ya that young like dad was the tallest man ever, and yeah being up a tree that was taller than dad was cool.  it weird because i can remember so much stuff and and like not many other poeple can... i can remember like one of me first memory was like when i was 2 i think well maybe 3-4 or something cause like yeah me brother chris was there and yeah me mum and dad living there so yeah... like yeah when i was young i was like a crazy kid.  Like yeah i did alot of things me mate thought holy shit...crazy mofo..

yeah when i was young i like did a superman(bike trick) and yeah like me other friends were like shit aye... i got massive air from it and busted me ankle...well not really, but i did brused it and yeah i had to keep on riding it hurt but eyah i just kept going cause i was like excited and yeah but fuck it hurt like heaps, yeah then the next few weeks later me and chris, me brother, went for a ride and i fucking stacked it like big time... i like scrapped me shoulder and elbow big time and yeah had to ride home and yeah i was crying and bleedng like heaps.  but yeah i got home good and had a wash then like 1 hour later i was back on the bike riding agian doing tricks and stacking it like bid time... didnt hurt meself though which is good... but i still couldnt get it right aye.  yeah i do a heap of things till i find that i have it right, but hten i go out like a few days later or when ever it happens its all different and wrong aye.  like everytime i go out kicking the football like when i think i got it, and yeah when i go out next time its all different like yeah when i was kicking in the semi-final agaisnt teachers west.  it was good i got like 5/8 i think or something out of 9 and yeah over 50%.

yeah that was a good day when i played in the semi-final, because i liekd score a hole heap of points...out ot 22 i got like 12 which is over half which is good because yeah i dont usually get that in a game... there have been a few games where i have scored all the points...the score being liek 27 - 3 and our team being the 3...lol and use thought it was teh 27... but yeah its cool and yeah i played mad i was buggered but like we had a shit ref because like yeah...and the funny thing was teachers were expecting to win and yeah we kicked there ass...like the final score was 22 - 10 and yeah teachers were having a shit day cause yeah we stole alot of the ball and yeah next eyar it will be under 18's so basically who we ever we played this year we play next year.  which is good because then we can try and win it... which would be good because in me own rugby career i have missed out on 1 final, i have made every other final and i have made two second semi-finals which yeah both were against brothers and yeah they won both time... fist time i was the captain and kicked the ball away but yeah lost by 7 points... and second on this year i kicked alot of the ball away...it was the first game i played in the backs all year... and yeah i didnt know much.  but doesnt matter there is always next year... because yeah we win it, than like we would be the first team to win the first 18's touranment so that would be good... like yeah, which will be good cause i got me mate playing and yeah he is pretty good cause he has a few skills and yeah when he gets a bit pissed of he is good... like yeah him and chris in the second... but i would rather cgris as number ... because yeah he got a better weight and good runner over short distances... that and the fact that the other flanker, greg, isnt that good and bunger, number 8, is better at flanker and yeah.  ut thats just me being coach again.

i like being coach which is good and yeah i like being captain as well but like yeah i would rather be a coach/captain like yeah but yeah hopfully i am the captain next year and i would like it if me brother, chris is the vice-captain, cause like yeah both forwards and yeah his got a little bit of grunt behind him which is good... and yeah just having me brother like next to since me other brother is going away...dave...know him for 5 years and yeah been mates for 5 years which is mad... and yeah he aint playing next year which is shit cause yeah he is a great rugby player.

yeha well thats long enough i think so yeah have fun guys nad girls... and i love cay heaps and yeah im madly in love with her"

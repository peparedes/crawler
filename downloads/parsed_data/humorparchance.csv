"event","god i freaking hate this life! im not in the mood to even be alive anymore! ahhh im stuck inside this hell and right now im just sickened. literally to the point of throwing up. yes it has happened. i had a time of a little less than half way peace but not anymore. it all has to come flooding back doesnt it. its impossible to have peace in this fucking world. you would think lets see we are out of school now...it will get better....it did....but then it all came crashing back down. I HATE BEING EMOTIONAL. it ruins your life. but ooh my life was already ruined. stupid stupid stupid! WHY do people have to believe all those rumors and mess up not 1 but two peoples lives! i quit i seriously do. ive fallen rock hard and im not even going to try to get back up again. It would be such an easy escape just to have everything be all over with. It would finally stop this pain that is devouring me and my heart. What i wouldnt do just to make it all end. This pain seriously has to be enough to kill you. im making the announcement now....im giving up. i lost. 

im sick of being treated like shit by people. i want to be left alone so that maybe i can die in PEACE! god are there even words to describe this? i think not. i would try to explain...but i still dont think you wouldnt understand ANY OF IT. i should have turned and ran like hell a long time ago. what the hell was i thinking? how could i so easily fall into such stupidity? what the heck happened? my world came crashing down. im crushed. im not getting back up. i hate this planet...i hate this world. i hate everything about everyone. i dont wanna live here anymore. but there is no where else to go. why does this keep happening? ahhhhhhh. give me a place to go and i will. i was increasing in recovery...oh but not anymore...i guess i will have to start over. i remember when this all happened two weeks ago. and i didnt understand then and i still dont because PEOPLE WONT GIVE EXPLANATIONS! SCREW THEM! i cant do this on my own. it wasnt supposed to turn out like this. but somehow it did. it didnt appear that this would happen...it was rolling so good....but then SOMEONE has to go start a rumor...and ruin ALL OF IT! oone day i will wreak havoc on them and put them through so much hell they will wish they had never survived. I HATE THAT CLASS! stupid sophmores....

This can be fixed....we can be made happy again....but we have to help each other...."

"event","gosh this song is just unbelievably way to true....i know many people dont realize it but....when something is going on with you and its really hard to even tell anyone just because they probably wouldnt get it or would just give you the stupid ""it will get better"" advice which is 200000 percent of the time NEVER TRUE...there are people that you want to tell but it gives harder to deal with after its told...and i hate it how you can be having a good day and then all the thoughts that you were on earlier come flooding back and ruin it....its also hard to tell certain people things because you dont want them to think your an ooh im so depressed my life is horrible situation....it applies way to much....and its hard to get past the thought that that is what they will think....and wont take you seriously....i dont know what has been up with me lately but its getting unbearable...its hard to appear happy and it finally broke for me...i really cant pretend to be happy with what is going on anymore...ive been pissed about so much lately and other emotional issues...and i hate it when you are in any type of relationship and you dont really want to pursue it because deep down you know it wont get anywhere or you think it would never work or somethin....again it applies...and i really hate how like the songs we listen to ALL the time something always happens when your listening to it so every single time you listen to it either someone or something comes to mind and its unbearable....i feel completely like crap....and i cant express enough...it we say we are ok...its usually not true....it just delays the truth and thats about it...now on to the problem of the past few weeks...i have a void and i dont know how to feel it and its making me miserable!
unwritten law is amazing......"

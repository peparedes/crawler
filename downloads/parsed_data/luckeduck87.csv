   Well it is SUMMER!!! Yippee!! I graduated from Lauralton last Sunday, which was awesome, no more all-girls high school for me!! I am sooo excited for this Summer. I feel like awesome things will happen. Well I do know that I'm going on a BIG vacation to Turks and Caicos in July, which is grrrreat!! I've always wanted to go on an island vacation. I've barely been out of the country (spending a day in Canada while on vacation in VT doesn't realle qualify as an exotic vacation). I can't wait to be in Turks and Caicos!!!!!! :-)  

   So far I've actually been pretty busy for the beginning of the Summer. I've been babysitting a lot for my neighbors. I love taking care of them, especially since the older kids are still in school I get to spend some one-on-one time with just the little ones. I also helped my Mom out with Tricky Tray last week. So much fun, it doesn't even feel like volunteer work, even at 9 in the morning. I remember when I was in elementary school and putting those tickets in the Tricky Tray boxes, so exciting, even though I never won. 

   Today I'm jealous though because I had to babysit Clare Bear while my Mom and Katie got to go swimming at my Aunt's house, in her heated in-ground pool. So they're lounging about having a good 'ol time with my Aunt and older cousins while I'm sweltering in here. I can't even go up to join them now because I have work at four, ughh. Not to mention it's like 90 degrees and we only have fans downstairs, it's too hot to even think. I realle hope that we stay inside for Child Link, because if we go outside I might just die! I only have three more days at Child Link though, which is kind of sad, but that also means I just may survive the horrible Mrs.Dean! :-P

   Alright, I guess that's it for now. I should go upstairs and cool off in my brother's air-conditioned room. Until later..."

Well, other then getting into my college nothing realle else new around here.  Monday was a snow day, awesomeness, not to mention that was the day I recieved my acceptance letter, heh.  And Tuesday was a half day, but since my car's locks were frozen I couldn't get into my car to drive to school so my mom let me and Katie stay home, pointless day anyway, 20 min. classes and then a Christmas assembly.  So basically this week is the best, not to mention tomorrow is Christmas Eve!! Yay, can't wait!! And there's less than 48 hours till Christmas, YAY!! And I finally have all my Christmas gifts bought and wrapped, double yay! I LOVE Christmas, it's the most wonderful time of the year!

Well, I better get back to cleaning for our Christmas Eve party.  If I never fold another piece of clothing ever again it'll be too soon!  LOL, well Merry Christmas everyone! Hope you get everything you wished for from Santa, heh.  

Merry Christmas to all and to all a good-night! :-)

Then, let's see, yesteday I went pumpkin picking with my family, funess, only my dad kept taking random pictures with his digital camera which made me soo soo mad, but overall a good time had.

Well let's see, i joined this realle kool babysitters community, just a lot of good stuff there.  umm...also ya know been showing up at school and work and i've been babysitting and all same old, same old.  actually i'm doing realle well in all my classes right now, i got a 90 on my first math test!! omg, that was the shock of a lifetime, awesomeness all around.  the only thing about school that's starting to stress me out is this whole college thing, i feel like i'm drowning in deadlines, it's driving me up a wall.  i just wish i could pick the college i wish to attend, and well...just go! why do we have to spend hours going over applications and essays and paperwork and blah blah blah????  ughh, plus i thought my guidance counselor would provide me with well...more guidance than she has, which is getting me nervous, but i'm feeling alittle better as time goes on, hopefully i'll survive!!  well, let's stop talking about college, shall we? heh

Ummm...i've been bize with child link, babysitting and well babysitting as well.  i'm kinda annoyed with 98% of my co-""workers"" at work, who actually do nothing and get paid for it, ughh, annoying annoying people.  on the other hand i love going to work, being greeted with all those little smiling faces, my little buddies make it all worth while.  i've also been babysitting a lot, which has been very enjoyable, all the kids i babysit are just awesome.

Anything else...well lets see, i had a long weekend this weekend, in which i spent mostly sleeping, catching up with some friends..oh, and on saturday i definitly spent like 4 hours with my favorite family...the Connals!  it was soooo awesome to see them, i loved hanging out with and talking with them, and playing with all of them, especially Madeleine, she's getting so big!  And i couldn't wait to see my Carolina Bell, oh how i love all the connals, they are just the best.  I wanted to take all seven of them to my house and keep them there, i hated seeing them go.  but i'll see them again at Megan's b-day party at the end of the month, so i'm happy about that, plus we have kept contact through aol and the phone so i get to talk with them a lot :-)

well that's about it for now, i'm prolly writing all this for like no one, lol, but that's alright, i love to write anyway.  Until later..."

"event","Well yea, school has started, that's just depressing and annoying in itself, where did the summer go?  Well, at least I'm a senior now, woohoo go class of '05!  And we actually did get some kool new senior privileges and our senior lounge is incredibly nice, so that part of school is pretty good.  As for my classes..well..they're actually going pretty well right now.  I realle like all of my teachers, and two of my teachers for my electives were my teachers when I was a freshman, so I know and their teaching style and like them both, so that's a plus.  And one of them was my favorite freshman teacher, who is one of the best teachers I ever had, I love the way she teaches and explains things.  She's actually the kind of teacher I wanna be when I become a teacher, so it's great being in here class bc I'm not only learning about Modern Lit, I'm also learning great ways to teach.  
  
  Also, just fyi everyone, my last final is on May 24th..hahaha.  That's right I get out like a month before anyone else, hahaha! (I'm not bragging or anything, not at all)

   Well, let's see, anything else new with me?  Not realle, I started working at Child Link the day after school started, it's kinda rough getting back into the work schedule but I loved seeing all the kids there, I realle did miss them.  It was so great to walk into the cafeteria and have like 5 kids yell my name and come up to hug me, that felt good.  I realle wish we had another long weekend tho, I dont' think I can take school and spending my after-school hours with my boss tomorrow (see I don't mind work, but I don't like my boss at all), so yea, that's gunna be hard.  Umm..I guess that's it for now, ughh I can see the new neighbors across the street jumping into their car, oh how I wish they never moved here, they so do not deserve the Connal house or this neighborhood, ughh ughh ughh.  Anyways, that was my complaint of the day, heh.  Well, until later..."

"event","Hey Everyone,
  Well so it's still summer but those annoying 'back to school' sales are popping up everywhere, you can't avoid the back to school announcements on the radio and stupid commercials on tv.  Ughh, it's all just so depressing, i definitly hate the week before school starts, it just feels like part of my life is fading away, not to return for another year.  Well, ughh, anyway my family and i visited the connals the day before yesterday for Madeleine's first birthday (i can't believe she's already one!), and we had a great time there.  We, of course, stayed the longest with them and it just felt so good to be with them and talk to them and just to spend time with them, i just missed them so much, well it was what i needed. :)  Let's see, i still have to finish my second summer reading book, which isn't tough to do it's just that finishing it means that school will be here soon *gulp*.  My stomach and throat seriously tighten whenever i hear the word school, it's sickening.  Iunno it just feels like when i start school and work and all that it's just a never-ending whirling tunnel in which i wish to escape from, hopefully it won't be as bad as i imagine.  I'm just glad that i didn't have to start as early as seymour, bridgeport and prep (haha!), they all started last week and that's gotta suck.  Anyway, today i decided to make the best of some of the last days of our summer and after going to get my outside senior pics done i brought my little sister to the park down the street for an hour, then we played on her swingset.  After that we had pizza for dinner and then i treated my family to ice cream with my gift certificate, and then we got some movies with my gift cards (putting them to good use), and picked up some soda, good things.  Well i guess i've rambled on enough, i just realle wish that somehow summer could go on forever and the connals could move back across the street, those are my two ultimate wishes, so there lol. well, until later..."

"event","Hey everyone.  today and tomorrow are very sad days in my life, my neighbors are finalizing their move (moving trucks, lots of boxes, empty rooms still full of memories, etc.) and it is depressing.  i hate all of it, i realle wish that they didn't have to move, i'd give anything for them to stay across the street, but since there's no way to stop them i guess i'll have to trudge through the move.  it's affecting me more than i expected, and it's very hard to deal.  the only thing that's good in my near future is that my me and my family are leaving for south carolina on thursday, and we're going on a three week vacation there, yay!  that brings up the whole packing situation, or lack there of, though.  i realle rather not sort and pack right now, but at least it keeps me busy and my mind off other things.  and i'm only like half way done packing and we're leaving in two days! eek! that's ok though, i work well under pressure, hey always works well for projects and stuff, like the memory book i made and put together for my neighbors in only two days, which was very tricky.  well, that's about it for now.  i just realle realle hope i'll have a great time in south carolina, and if i don't my life will officially be a total depressing mess, ughh.  but that will certainly not happen, it will not.  ok, well i guess i've babbled on enough. until later..."

Fourth of July was grreat, played badminton, eat lobster and saw the awesome fireworks, the finale was pretty kool. then when we got home we did some of our own fireworks, a police car went up and down our street acouple times, acouple close calls but we never got caught.  then the connals came home and we got to show them our fireworks and do sparklers and party poppers with them, which was awesome...our last fourth of july as neighbors tho, very saddening 
:-(. well that was it for the fourth.  today my dad had off from work so he took me and katie bowling at nutmeg, wow no personalities for the workers there. and i had to return my bowling shoes twice, once bc of a shoelace malfunction and another time because there was a major rip on the side of one of the shoes, which i could like stick my foot thru, interesting. well, i ended up winning the second game we played there, my score was 117, awesomeness!  then we went to borders and i got one of my summer reading books, and three mystery books, two CSI:Miami book which look awesome, i can't wait to read those three, should be great.  also got the truman show on dvd, which i've been looking for, i could definitly spend like days in borders, it's huge, and their chairs are so comfortable i could read like the whole mystery section there, heh.  well i guess that's it for now, i'm currently helping a fellow yanks fan big sister torture her younger brother who's a red sox fan (BOOOOO)!! it's realle fun tho, heh.  oh, and fyi if i don't feel like talking to anybody or am realle down in the near future it's bc my neighbors who i love to death are moving and i'm very depressed over it, so just work with me.  ok, until later..."

"event","well today's monday, i usually hate mondays with my whole heart and soul but guess what? today isn't just any monday, it's the LAST MONDAY OF MY JUNIOR YEAR!!  yipeee!!! that's right...you may return your jaw to its normal position now.  yep, this was the last monday of classes for my school and since next week is finals but we don't have any finals on memorial day, this is it, the terrible mondays are over as far as my junior year is concerned!! :-) and yea, this was a pretty monday monday, i got a total of two and a half hours of sleep last night, well technically this morning, because i was working on a project i left until the last minute as usual, which i didn't even get to present today, that's just my luck.  but w/e i napped so i wasn't totally exhausted this morning.  the whole school day went by in kind of a haze, i mean i remember walking through the halls traveling from class to class and sitting in my desk, listening to the teacher, but that was about all i remember. it was like my body and mind were disconnected from each other throughout the whole day, but realle who cares it's the last week of school.  oh, fyi shrek 2 is a GREAT movie, saw it on wed. with my little sis, it's awesome, so GO SEE IT all you shrek fans!  well i guess that's it for now, until later...

"event","hey everyone, not much to update on but i haven't updated in a while so i guess something is better than nothing.  well, let's see...haven't been doing much lately, been driving around a lot in my dad's car since my car still isn't 100%.  i've also been counting down the days i have left in school, 15 MORE DAYS!!! i can't wait until summer, oh how good it will feel to not have anything to do, just swim and drive around, get ice cream, tan (or try to anyway) and la de dah...summer is definitly something to look forward to!! let's see...today's mother's day, happy mother's day to all you mothers!  umm...today was pretty good we went to church this morning where i ran the nursery as usual, only one little boy was there during the whole service, so it was an easy job.  and then me and my sister and my mom went to kohls where i bought an outfit for today, a cute black and pink striped skirt and a black top.  and then we went to the club with the realatives, fun stuff.  well, i guess that's about it for now. until later..."

"event","Hey everyone, guess what? I GOT MY DRIVER'S LICENSE!!! Woohoo!!!! I'm so relieved, i was all hyped up before the test, you would not believe.  Well, the test wasn't at all as bad as i imagined it to be, i only got 1 wrong on the written (it was a stupid question anyway) and i passed the driving part without a flaw, i had Bill which helped bc he is soo nice.  anyways, i got my license yesterday, i actually had to get it done 3 times bc of a stupid signature error, stupid DMV.  And the first time i drive alone is tonight, but not in my car bc my dad needs to bring it somewhere for some parts to get fixed but i do get to drive my dad's car. ok, granted i only get to drive it up the street to the house where i'm babysitting, but hey it's still somewhere.  And who knows where i'll go after i'm done babysitting, maybe to black rock..the mall....rhode island...or down the street to my house, who knows, hehe.  well that's realle all for now, cept i did take the SAT's today, whole bunch of blahness for that experience, fuuuuuuuun. ok well until later..."

"event","hey everyone, it's me yet again.  so nothing realle new goin on around here i did get my icon uploaded, comment if you like that good luck carebear pic.  i also changed the format so the icon would show up, it's so stupid that some formats don't let it, especially since

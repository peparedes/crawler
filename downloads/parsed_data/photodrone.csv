I starting the night with a couple of quick shots before I realized that the card I had selected for the evening was full. I scanned the first few on the card and knew they were duplicated at home.
I formatted. Shot all night. Filled the card, quit shooting (usually at least 140 shots on that full card). 50 is just an estimate, not exact.
The camera says it only had 2 exposures left but only 67 are reviewable. So really there could be 100 missing in that directory."

A concert in Tulsa at <a href=""http://www.cainsballroom.com/"">Cain's Ballroom</a>. On a Wednesday (I have to work at 8:00am the next morning). So, I drive up to Tulsa after work, about a two-hour drive. Along the way, it's raining. I hydroplane for about 30 miles with a maximum speed of 45-50mph. I finally get there and <a href=""http://ubl.artistdirect.com/music/artist/card/0,,990450,00.html"">Crisis</a> is already on stage. Then it's <a href=""http://www.otep.com/"">Otep</a>. Then, <a href=""http://www.kittie.net/"">Kittie</a>. <a href=""http://www.morganlander.bestmusicpages.com/"">Morgan Lander</a> is the best thing since <a href=""http://www.metallica.com/Band/james.asp"">James Hetfield</a>. That's why I do it. </p>
<p>My brother-in-law, who lives 20 minutes from the venue, meets me there. It's nice to have a photo pass and be on the guest list. It helps to offset the $7.00 in turnpike fees (round trip from Oklahoma City to Tulsa). When I first walk in, Morgan is near the door signing autographs. I fall in line since, after all, I am a true fan. I hand off some photos (<a href=""http://www.tapdig.com/gallery/kittie/IMG_5284"">1</a>,<a href=""http://www.tapdig.com/gallery/kittie/IMG_5075"">2</a>,<a href=""http://www.tapdig.com/gallery/kittie/IMG_5219"">3</a>) that I took of Kittie back in July when they played in Oklahoma City, which is the most fun I've ever had shooting bands, that's why I do it. She says, ""Where'd you get these??"" I explained that I took them. I had printed one specifically for her to autograph (<a href=""http://www.tapdig.com/gallery/kittie/IMG_5075"">2</a>), but she wanted that one, too. That's cool, so I have her sign another image which I happened to have brought two copies with me. </p>
<p>Again, it was a lot of fun and well worth my efforts. I enjoyed all the acts on the ""<a href=""http://www.clevescene.com/issues/2004-10-13/music/nightwatch.html"">Metal Movement Tour 2004</a>."" It's not often that you see a metal/screamo/thrash/death/speed band fronted by a female. On this night there were three of them. Sweet. It rocked and I can't wait to see Kittie again."

"event","I have been shooting a lot of skies and clouds recently. I don't know what draws me to it, but for the last couple of months there has been quite a show in the sky and I happen to notice it. Perhaps they come from all the hurricanes we've had in the near past. Although Oklahoma doesn't evacuate or have any danger from hurricanes. Rather it's the disturbance in the jet stream and the influence from the Senate. </p>
<p>""Use the force, Luke,"" is a phrase I have grown up with. Me and some local shooters use the phrase ""Jedi mind trick,"" to indicate a successful image. The force is all around us, it's what binds us together. We watched Michael Moore's latest horror flick on <i>9/11</i> today. We had watched <i>Bowling</i> a few weeks ago. It makes me so proud to be an American. And of the people that We The People have put in Washington. Fear thy neighbor is par.</p>
<p>So, anyway. Besides clouds. This has been a slow month for my photography. A side effect of my new job. I did have a trip to the <a href=""http://www.fortworthzoo.org/"">Ft. Worth Zoo</a>, the best zoo around these parts IMO. Many cloud days. Kendrick Bailey playing his guitar at <a href=""http://www.bills-pub.com/"">Mr. Bills</a>. And an <a href=""http://blog.tapdig.com/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/index.opolis"">Opolis</a> sighting for <a href=""http://www.pleasantgrovemusic.com"">Pleasant Grove</a> and <a href=""http://www.studentfilm.tk"">Student Film</a>.</p>
<p>I have reduced my input to my weblog while building my <a href=""http://photo.tapdig.com/"">photoblog</a>. I'm at a point now where I almost don't see a need for both. I will try to manage and update <a href=""http://blog.tapdig.com/"">here</a> more regularly.</p>

"event","Tapdig.com is now located at a new server with the same <a href=""www.icdsoft.com"">hosting company</a>. The previous server was in Hong Kong. The new server is in the United States of America. I hope this geographic move speeds up access speeds, since most visitors to this site are US. The main purpose for the move is for storage space. I've upgraded from the ""Personal Plan"" of 333MB to the ""Business Plan"" of 999MB storage. I can't believe that I've filled up 333MB. That's a lot of pictures. The <a href=""http://www.tapdig.com/gallery"">Gallery</a> says there are 1,762 photos in the system. Some webmasters might cut content to save storage space. I am against this sort of practice. I believe that once something is placed online... it needs to stay there forever. Others link to your stuff, quote your stuff, reference your stuff... I sure hate it when I bookmark something and when I return their stuff is gone or changed. So, I buy more storage. I thought it'd be a horrible experience to move, but due to the fact that both the old and new servers are identical, it was pretty easy. Same OS, same locations for perl, and other programs. Same great service. I wouldn't recommend a server move for everyone. Just as I wouldn't recommend using blosxom as a blogging tool. Unless of course you know perl, apache, htaccess, html, css, and so on. Or you want to learn a few things, which was my case. Now that I have storage space again, look for more frequent updates and new images."

The Mints are on the road. Final show for the Metered Spirits. What are the chances of me seeing two shows on consecutive nights and both out-of-town bands are from Minnesota? I had thought from Haley's <a href=""http://www.haleybonar.com/"">website</a>, without hearing a sound, that she'd be a cross between PJ Harvey and Tori. It was a close comparison. Haley was very soft and somewhat droning. Many patrons said they were fighting the urge to sleep, I think in a good way. I admit, it was a mellow act, but nothing to sleep about. Too bad Metered Spirits are no more. I had not realized how musically gifted Lindsay is. They hit some nice harmonies on vocals. I shoot <a href=""http://www.starlightmints.com/"">the Mints</a> tonight at the Diamond. cheers

I stopped to think. Am I shooting a person or a tree? Ever since then, I try to shoot tighter or minimize the background somehow. I don't do any studio work right now, but your site has encouraged me back in that direction. You do some neat things with the colors/lights in you backgrounds. cool."

Photos from the <a href=http://www.tapdig.com/gallery/opolis020404>Bishop Allen show from the Opolis</a> made it in the Norman Transcript Pop magazine on Friday. My first byline in years. Sort of a review/preview snip. I hope it helps pack the Deli on a Tuesday.

The near future looks like more Shop Art, and (mentioned above) a date at the Deli with Bishop Allen, Jonesound, and it appears the Stellas will be there, now, too, on Tuesday night. Also, I'll try to make the Opolis 2 or 3 times this week to expand the <a href=http://blog.tapdig.com/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/index.opolis>Opolis photo archive page</a>.

<blockquote>""Remember, journalism is what somebody doesn't want you to print. Everything else is publicity. ""
-Jim Hall, Beginning Reporting
-from <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/rzr_grl"">rzr_grl's journal</a> today.</blockquote>

I met Barb (from http://www.oklahomapunkscene.com/) last night at the <a href=""http://www.vagiants.com"">VaGiants</a> show. I noticed her taking notes on a little pad. I was shooting pictures viciously. After the show, I ask her what she's doing. She says oklahomapunkscene.com/ and I say I'm having fun. She should use my pics in her column. She says contact me.

During the exchange of contact methods, I ask if she does live journal. She says, ""No, it's too confessional."" I say, ""but there are lots of local music freaks on there. (It's a digital scene.)"" I had never thought of lj her way. I thought about it all day. When I saw rzr_grl's post, it seemed to apply. I agree with her, sure. But, there's more to it. I've seen many confessional journals. I've seen purely publicity journals. But there's also the variety and mixed bag. I have friends here that, more or less, do less publicity, but it's hard to label as confessing. I like checking my friends page.

I literally had no lj experience until recently. I'm making it my own, as each of you has. I suppose I'm on the publicity side. But it's like politics: varying degrees of parties. Lieberman is a self proclaimed ""moderate democrat."" What the hell does that mean? He can run against Bush while still supporting the republican beliefs? I must be a moderate publicist."

"event","A punk band from Winnipeg, Manitoba. When I saw them on the line up at <a href=""http://www.conservatoryokc.com"">The Conservatory</a>, I checked out the <a href=""http://www.vagiants.com"">VaGiant site</a> and listened to a <a href=""http://www.newmusiccanada.com/genres/artist.cfm?Band_Id=6934"">mp3</a>. I thought it sounded power pop - punk. After seeing the live presentation, and hearing more than one song, I concluded that a better description is power blues - punk. Sort of a roadhouse punk band. 
<p>The band presents well with a not shy, in your face lead vocalist, Joanne (aka J-Rod). Just a simple three piece with J-Rod on vocal. I might go as far to say it was the best punk band I've seen on stage since Hagfish, back around 1994. I think that's accurate, but consider that I have not seen very much punk in the 9 year span since then.
<p>I became aware of maybe a sexual theme. VaGiant could be a play on the word vagina. The album I got is titled ""Short and Hard."" And the first song on it is ""Hot Box."" To top it all off, the singer wore a little babydoll dress which came up a short. Meaning, she wore purple pasties to keep from getting arrested. She expressed her thanks for being in Oklahoma's tropical environment, January, 15 degrees F. They had escaped the -30 degrees C from Winnipeg.
<p>Their manager had told me by email that Joanne would be quite photogenic. She was right. And not at all shy about it. I took 130 images. I'd say 50 or so are worth looking at (due to poor lighting, as usual). I've gone ahead and posted two on my <a href=""http://www.tapdig.com/gallery/photodujour"">photodujour</a>. I'll add them to my <a href=""http://www.tapdig.com/gallery/bands"">music gallery</a> very soon.
<p>Note: I regret to have missed the opening acts. The 45 minute drive from my house left me late, and the show was early."

I have navigation floating at the top left. I'd like to have a similar box at the bottom left. Same width, just at the bottom, with background in between. CSS helpers would be nice. I will deal with the XHTML part of this later.

"event","I was starting the redesign of my blosxom blog (http://blog.tapdig.com) site. I was looking for inspiration for my dive into CSS adaptation and my multiple user idea. I hit some of my favorite bookmarks looking for examples of good design: ""na, na, too plain, na, oh this is a really cool photographer's site, i remember this..."" Then I proceed to hit view source to check it out, and what was the first thing I saw? <blockquote>...
&lt;meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=windows-1252""&gt;

&lt;meta name=""GENERATOR"" content=""Microsoft FrontPage 6.0""&gt;

&lt;meta name=""ProgId"" content=""FrontPage.Editor.Document""&gt;
...</blockquote>
I ran. Shut the browser as fast as I could. nevermind. i'm still shivering and nauseous.

So anyway. I downloaded everything that runs blosxom, got it running locally fairly easily, i have not launched apache in a long while. actually only forgot the Win ActivePerl shebang#! but it's fine now. i've been running blosxom since October on Linux host only and this is the first time I've run it locally. this is also the first time i've thought about a redesign. My goal is to make it seem more like a photographer's site, and less like a blog. But still using a blog CMS for content. The learning curve is bitch. 1. Figure out theme/flavor system. 2. Fiddle with RSS feed. 3. CSS div BS. 4. Craptastic!

(warning: rant) I've been following recent discussion at the blosxom user group at yahoo about the CSS/XHTML plateau. Actually the discussion goes back to my beginnings in the group, and other groups and forums. I've always been ""like screw validation"" and ""who has time to learn XHTML when I already know how to hand code HTML?"" Besides, my CSS validates. Fuck standards. But now i've decided to scrap the tables, insert the divs. It's a leap for me, since I so violently resist the usability, accessibility, validation, bumper sticker to prove it, zeldman lover, oreilly preacher, web hackers... who are a lot like myself in several other ways. And I don't know anyone that visits my site from a cell phone. If you do, let me know. Or if you visit my site and you're blind, tell me. just curious. (/rant)

what do i resist more? standards or front page? btw, my frontpage horror originated from http://www.jenyk.com/ (home of really cool band photography, too much B+W images I thought)<img src=""http://blog.tapdig.com/cgi-bin/tl/logs.pl"" height=1 width=1>"

This was a fun night of shooting. My goal that night was to shoot 300 images. I came very close, over 250. The bad part is, the success rate was what I had expected. ""Lucky shot syndrome"" is usually about 10% I'd guess. <p>Faced with difficult lighting, worse than usual at times, I tried some experimentation with flash and long exposures. I seemed to have good luck at 1600, 4 seconds, f5.6. Several times I covered the lens with my hand knowing that the exposure was too long. I guess it's a form of painting with light.<p>Thinking about <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/users/rzr_grl>Angela</a>. I turned the review off this night. I had gotten so used to looking at the small rendering of an image in that LCD window after every shutter. I felt like Luke by the end of the night, ""Let the force flow."" Ends up, I did pull off several jedi mind tricks.<p>The crowd was full of beautiful people and my experiments continued into the black hole of standing-room-only."

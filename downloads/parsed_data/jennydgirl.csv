"event","<font color=""#333399"" size=""4"">I fuckin' hate being depressed! It is so depressing! I, again, never have any money, my boyfriend said he is gonna stop hanging out with me so much, because he has a C in his AP Bio class, when he needs an A, I am hearing two people sing a song for the Dessert Concert that sound good, but it makes me depressed, becuase I love that song, and it reminds me of love, and of hating love at the same time.<br />Which brings me to another point, why does love have to hurt so much? I mean, yes, love is great, and being in love is even better, but what happens if there is no more love in that relationship? Then what are you supposed to do? Just stay with that person, or hurt them and yourself, both at the same time??? Answer that.</font>"

Winnie the pooh, winnie the pooh,... hahaha... -_-<--zzz 

Finally! my teleportation device is complete!!! I can now freely roam around the world whenever I want! All I need now is my sack lunch, water, and a port-a-potty only for me.  First place I should go is... Japan! I hear they have good sushi there...wait... I don't like sushi. Oh well... Off to Japan I go!!! 

As I arrive in Japan, I think to myself, wait, this is not Japan, it is a crook's island strategically called Japan. Oh well, I guess I should start being more specific. I spent the night on this strange island, and as I wander around, I get more and more confused, because it looks just like the actaul Japan, but there is this whole other side to it that I am not sure of. 

The next morning comes, and as I leave, I set the correct address to my house. I getr to my house, and i think to myself, gee, that was very interesting. I wonder if I can go to peoples' houses... I tried, and I got to my boyfriend's house. I told him about the teleportation device that I have created, and he did not believe me. I asked him where he wanted to go to, and he said that he wants to go to Rhode Island. So, as you have guessed it, we went to Rhode Island. I was cool, but if we keep using the teleportation device to go places too much, then we will die, because of the radiation poisoning."

"event","Today is Friday the 13th, and as I walk into my classroom during 3rd period, I get rudely interrupted by some stupid little Junior, who yells halfway across the room, ""Hey! Today's not Halloween!, you freak! Take off the costume!"" Well, I turned to him, and I said, "" Why don't you take off that mask you're wearing!"" Well, then he turns to his stupid friends and says, ""Damn, she's racist."" 

This pisses me off soo much, because of the fact that why the hell do people give a damn what I wear, or why do I care for that matter? I mean, people are so frickin' mean and hypocritical! I just want to turn to that guy and smack him in the face soo freakin' hard, because today, he and his gosh-darn friends kept spitting paper balls at me and some of my friends, and I kept telling them to stop. Little do they know that my b/f is a 3rd-degree black belt, and that I tend to have a bit of a very bad temper whenever I get seriously mad.

Other than that, I have been doing good. My relationship with my boyfriend is going terrific, and I think I just might know for a fact that I am in love with him, and hopefully, he is in love with me as well. I have had a ton of fun this week. Next Saturday, which is the 21st of October, is our Dessert Concert. For those who are actually reading this, it is a concert that the B.V. choir and madrigals put on a huge show for their parents, loved ones, and relatives. We sing, dance, even do a little acting! The ticket price is $12.00 at the door, and it is from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. I hope you random people go and have fun."

"event","So, I'm sitting in my desk in my 3rd period, and these morons keep throwing paper balls everywhere in the classroom, so I turn around, and say, ""will you guys please stop?"". they are so stupid, because then, they threw a paper ball at me. I turned around to them, and said, ""that's it, the next ball you throw at me, I will punch your lights out!"" I swear, the older some guys get, the dumber they act. For instance, I was just in the parking lot of my library, when one of my friends was trying to pick up my boyfriend to go back to school.Well, he told me that he was very happy. I said why. He said, ""her"", and pointed to, I guess, his girlfriend. Well, do you know what he asked me next? He said, ""Did you blow your boyfriend yet?"" So, I smacked the back of his head quite hard.
Don't you just love how some guys can act like total morons, and the rest act like guys, but also like gentlemen? Lucky for me, i got a good guy."

You don't have to ask if it is the correct way to say it, just DO IT!!! At every single school i go to, there is always one stupid person who says the correct thing the completely wrong way. It annoys me so much! Another thing that annoys me is the stupid inuendos.

I see people all scattered around, and some people missing some limbs. I think to myself, oh no! is there another atomic bomb?! I walk into the room that had the explosion, and to my surprise, there was the baker, just standing there, spatula in hand, cowaring underneath the table. I walk over to him, and ask him if he is alright. He says yes, but he doesn't know what had happened. He said to have claimed that he was baking a cake, be then all of a sudden, *BOOM* the cake batter blows up and sends everyone from a 50-foot radius hurdling to their deaths. I walk up to the cake batter and notice that something is very fishy. And it is not just the fish. Little did he know, that he put the wrong kind of powder in it. That made the explosion. I guess he learned his lesson. don't cook near people."

""Oh, no!!! we're gonna die!!!!"" yells the littlest doughboy. ""Shut up and eat yourself!"" yells its big brother. So, he does, and he stops to say, ""yum, I taste good."" so, as you thought, he begins to eat himself, and then, his brothers eat him.

"event","Do you know what I hate more than anything in the world?! It is stupid people and the damn people that dress all showy!!!! I mean, why the hell do the god damn preps have to wear clothing that is barely there? If they want to do that, than I say they should just go to school or where ever the frick they are going to go just plain out naked for that matter!!!!! If they are going to go to a school, than I say they should wear clothing that is suitable for school; meaning: a shirt that ACTUALLY covers the boobs, a skirt that if the girl sits down, you WON'T be able to see the underwear, and pants that if the girl sits down, you WON'T be able to see the crack of the butt or the thong! That is soooo gross!!!!!  

Now, on to the stupid people! The first thing I hate about them, is the way they act! Yes, of course, they act stupid, but maybe they actually aren't stupid. Here is my theory: they actually do stupid things because A: They do it for attention, B: They do it for money or to be popular, C: They actually are stupid, or D: They are complete freakin' morons and don't know any better. I just don't know why they do these things. I mean, sure, it is fun to watch them do these things, but if you watch them a bit too many times, it starts to get really old, really fast.

Now, on to the dang guys that let their pants hang too low!!! Have you ever wanted to just walk up to a guy with his pants hanging really low and just pants him? I have wanted to do this SOOO many times, but I don't have the guts to. If you ever see the guys with their pants hanging below their butts, walk up to them, and pants them for me!!!!!!!

"event","Have you ever wondered what REALLY makes the world go 'round? I'm not talking about the whole orbiting thing. I am talking talking about what economically or what not makes the world go in circles. Could it be the fact that money or love makes the world go 'round?, or could it be something else?

Do you know what else is weird? Whenever I am this bored, I start to be all smart and all like this. I am normally quite the hyper kind of person. Do you know what else? I don't know what else. I am just seriously bored.

Why do you think people fall in love? I mean, in some cultures, people can't fall in love. Their parents have to choose who to marry. That would honestly suck if I had to do that. I mean, I would rather marry someone I love rather than marry someone I just met."

Paint Me Like I Am

Why don't you paint me
Like I am?
Paint me happy, 
Laughing, running down a path of happiness
Paint me with a smile on my face.

Paint me with long wavy black hair
And my rosy cheeks.
Paint me sunflowers, red and white roses.
Paint me with bears, rabbits and baby deer
In my arms, dancing around me.
Paint me somewhere wonderful
Somewhere where there's sunshine and
A light blue sky
With butterflies floating
Around that lovely sky.

Paint me without my sadness.
Paint me without my sorrow.
Paint me without my tears.
Paint me so my pain won't show.

Can you see the face telling you paint me happy,
Paint me with life, but most of all
Paint me free."

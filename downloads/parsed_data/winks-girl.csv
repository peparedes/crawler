Vinyl seats soft from the heat of the sun
Chewin on a Slim-Jim
Cant stop thinkin' 'bout him
Yeah Yeah Yeah he's the one
Him, yeah yeah yeah he's the one

Bridge:
Oooh hooo Oooh Lifes so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Oooh hoo Oooh Yeah, life's so sweet

When I look to my left
See his sun-tanned hands
His muddy river hair
And his thousand acre plans
I'm all shook up like a quarter in a can
Aint life sweet?
In the passenger seat!

I daydream of me in a cold cotton field
and the feel of his skin
Window sill smiles, and before I know it
I'm miles away sittin' next to him
Miles away sittin' next to him

Bridge (1x)
Chorus (1x)

(Right here, its me right here, its me right here in the passenger seat)

Shiftin' those gears
Baby one, two, three
Then he shifts those ocean eyes back to me
Can't imagine a moment any better than this...
Then we kiss...

Kiss me all over is all I can say
I've waited a lifetime to feel this way
You leave me breathless
And out of my mind.
I'm just so helpless
So baby be kind

I lost my heart
When I found you
Yeah, it feels so good
To lose
I lost my heart
When I found you.
I lost my heart to you

You touched me in places
Deep in my heart
Imagination runs wild in the dark
Babe, I surrender
Only to you.
I can't remember
How it feels to be blue

I lost my heart
When I found you
Yeah, it feels so good
To lose
I lost my heart

today. I wonder if he had a good day... I hope he did. Hopefully I will talk to him soon. My day was kinda eh. School was ok but I started to feel sick again. I hope that I diden't get Wink sick. Say a prayer so that he dosen't get sick. Mrs. Blose's son came home from Iraq, he came to school to tell us whats it like over in Iraq. It was pretty cool. He has to go back soon so say a prayer for him. Say a prayer for everyone that is over in Iraq. Blah I forgot my biochem book at school so I can't get my homework done tonight. Well thats ok I can get it done during chorus tomorrow. Well i'm gonna go. Cya Later!! ~winks_girl"

I hate it when you realize that the person you think of as your best friend doesnt think of you the same way. I guess thats all just part of growing up. I dont know it hurts though. i guess i just have to face the facts. 

I am doing good at my work. I enjoy it.

The play is going good. I am having a good time. EVERYONE WILL BE THERE...RIGHT. If you do not come for my first lead in a musical I will know what you think of me.

I cant believe that this person would go and tell someone something that i told them. If you tell someone something you expect that they wont go and blab. if I wanted that person to know i would have told them. *GOSH* 
I am kind of sad that there wont be a girls day I was looking forward to it. ahh well i dont care. 
Drama is going good I am a little nervous about opening day being in less than two weeks, but it is all good. I hope you ALL come to it. I will be keeping tabs.

"event","Things are going so great for me I guess. Part of me wants to run away from my house and never ever go back. I feel like my mom has lost interest in everything I do and everything i want to do. Duane on the other hand is my NUMBER 1 Fan and he is here for me through everything. He puts up for my being sad and not having a job and everything, he just assures me that i will always be safe with him and he will always love me. 

Sam was in an accident, poor Sam, i feel so bad for her. Things dont really seem to be working out to her benifit right now. But have faith, and God can and WILL fix everything. 

I miss my sister. I feel like I dont even know who she is anymore. you are supposed to be close to your sister, tell eachother everything and cry on the others shoulder. But I dont do that. I feel like I dont have a sister because I dont see her. I can understand if she wants to get away from my mom  or shut out a part of her life or WHATEVER. But when I move  out or just go away all the time I will at least make a point to spend time with my sister. I dont thing I did anything wrong and If I did i am very sorry. 

The play is going ok I guess. opening night is decemer 1st at 7:00 I am expecting you all to be there at least one of the nights. Tickets are 4.00

I want to thank the twins and Mandi for trying to be there for me. Even though you were late I am honored that you tried for me. I am still pissed at my sister for not being there for me at the crowning ceremony. I can understand if it was something that she HAD to do, but it wasnt. I cant elieve that her friends are more important than being there for her sister. And its not like she didnt know about it. WHATEVER. it is her loss that she missed me in the queens court.

I feel like everthing has happoned so fast int he last couple weeks. I am now not talking to my asshole father. I am moving and I was in a pageant. wow its been crazy. If anyone wants my new address it will be on here soon. I have not moved yet but i will be in the next couple weeks.

Two weeks ago I thought that i wasnt even gunna be able to do my pageant. The money wasnt there and I am so busy. It really didnt seem logical. Now I am able to go and everything is falling right on my plate. I went and I got the best shoes for 30 bucks for my gown. I went to go get my dress hemmed and I got a new slip(the kind that I wanted) I got a business suit and two pairs of shoes for 130 bucks. I am so pumped for this I cant wait.

NEXT WEEKEND AT THE WESTIN AT DETROIT METRO AIRPORT. SUNDAY AT 8:00 IS THE CROWNING CEREMONY(WHERE IF I WIN YOU WILL SEE ME GET CROWNED ETC.) IT IS 15 BUCKS A TICKET.

I am so tired!! I was at Melvindale days since like 3 and I was at the booth for my church(we do a free face painting booth) and I was there unil 9 and then I was walking around with Sam and it was fun. we played games and I won 2 and she won 1. it was cool. I won Duane a Pink monkey. I hope he likes it!! 

Then...
I thought Duane was mad at me.. but i guess he wasnt. he was just sad that he and I didnt get to hang out after he got off work. so... I am happy that he isnt mad!!

CLOWN...
It's ok. I am not mad at you, I was just sad because I really really wanted to hang out with you but you didnt come and i was worried that something may have happened to you or whatever and you didnt call so I was sad more than anything. its ok and you can make it up to me. we can have our own birthday party. lol

I love everyone and I am exausted. I am going to bed and I will be going to church in the morning and then I will be with duane somewhere, at mel days sometime of the day.

My Birthday was yesterday and I had so much fun. Everyone showed up except CLOWN. I dont know why she didnt come she told me she was gunna. maybe she forgot or something I just wish she would have called. I was looking forward to hangin out with her. But besides that I had a ball. everyone came over and we hung out and then it stormed and we had to come in the house and then we had pizza and cake and ice cream and then I opened presents. KT got me a basket full of candles etc. and Bethany and Krystal got me bath stuff. which I love. and *I think my friends think I smell* anyway. Then Mandi and the twins were *fashionably* late and got me a CUTE skirt and like 3 tops to go with it and a sweater and a finding nemo pillow. I love it. I enjoy all my gifts and thanks to all that came and we had a ball at the sleepover, we played hoopla and it was fun and then we watched The Notebook! *sobs* it was such a good movie. well now I am at home and I am about to go to bed because I am going to Michigan Adventures tomorrow,!! yay

I hope, and the doctors arent sure if he is gunna have any long-term dammage because he is so little. One good thing is that with him being so little most of his gross and fine motor skils are still developing and that will be good because he can still 'grow'. He may be a little delayed though.

My Dad came though!! YAY that makes me so happy!! I called him and asked him if he could make it and he said he was still at work but he was trying, even if he was a little bit late he wouldnt miss it for the world.

Nothin special happened today. cant hang out with Duane because my mom ""wants me home"" I hat that, it pisses me off. found out today that I am below the growth percentile for my age. I'm too short. That sucks. today I plan to laze around and listen to music and play with my kitty, Rhaodi. I love her. Gunna call Bethany and see if she is feeling better. see if she wants to hang out. Gunna call Krissy maybe and see what the Baby is gunna be. and then I'm gunna do homework, cll the boy and sleepo, lots of sleep. Maybe I will go to rehersal at church that sounds like fun.</FONT></STRONG> </FONT></P>

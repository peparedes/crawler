Held up so high 
On such a breakable thread 

</FONT><FONT color=#cc66cc><STRONG>You were all the things I thought I knew 
And I thought we could be</STRONG> 

CHORUS 
</FONT><FONT color=#cc66cc><STRONG>You were everything, everything that I wanted 
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it 
And all of our memories, so close to me, just fade away 
All this time you were pretending 
So much for my happy ending 
So much for my happy ending</STRONG>

You've got your dumb friends 
I know what they say 
They tell you I'm difficult 
But so are they 
But they don't know me 
Do they even know you? 
</FONT><FONT color=#cc66cc><STRONG>All the things you hide from me 
All the shit that you do</STRONG> 

</FONT><FONT color=#cc66cc><STRONG>You were all the things I thought I knew 
And I thought we could be</STRONG> 

CHORUS 

</FONT><FONT color=#cc66cc><STRONG>It's nice to know that you were there 
Thanks for acting like you cared</STRONG> 
</FONT><FONT color=#cc66cc><STRONG>And making me feel like I was the only one 
It's nice to know we had it all</STRONG> 
</FONT><FONT color=#cc66cc><STRONG>Thanks for watching as I fall 
And letting me know we were done</STRONG> 

CHORUS X 2 

</FONT><STRONG><FONT color=#cc66cc>So much for my happy ending
So much for my happy ending</FONT></STRONG></EM></PRE>

I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me

Feel the wind on your shoulder 
For a minute, all the world can wait

Can you believe summer is already 1/2 way through?? I know-hardly something any of us want to be thinking about right now...but still...wow!

So much has been happening. My world has become transformed by so many amazing things since I last wrote:

-I have 'refound' the Lord and am experiencing love and joy like I never have before.
-I'm peeling from a splendid sunburn.
-I've had my 1st slice of summer Lou Malnati's.
-I found out I have biceps...there are pretty big muscles in my arms. I'm a beast.
-I'm in the process of landing a great job after a long dry spell.
-My bank account is practically overflowing!!
-I'm content and at peace. Really at peace.
-I have realized God's purpose for me on this earth.

Today our pastor spoke about celebrating in the midst of our enemies. We have to celebrate break bread and be joyous IN THE MIDST of the bad; not try to get rid of it ourselves and THEN bring Jesus into our lives. What a great thought! We don't have to suffer! We weren't made to suffer! We can conquer all with the Lord and BE JOYOUS IN THE MIDST. Doesn't that put a smile on your face!? :)

I'm enjoying my summer downtime. I'm enjoying my time alone...although I do wish I hung out with more people but it just seems we can't get schedules to correspond. All will come together-I have no worries! 

I diggin' the smiley faces today :)

Alright, I'm off to the gym to work off some energy! WHOOOOOOOOOooooo. I never knew running could be so relaxing but I'm really gettin' into it. 

Luke 6:27
But I say onto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you.

Amen"

Last night I was in an undisclosed town with a really big gun targeting this person who was so fat she couldn't fit through a door....why would I snipe a person who is that big??! *Random*

Beyond that I'm back in Atown for a bit. Soaking up some sun (and rain apparently) and doing some laundry. L is holding down the fort at school...its not like he's suffering-he hangs out with my bro or his car buddies in the hookah room! SEXY

Ah yes! We finally have a hookah room! My bro picked up a bangin' 4 hose for $100, we brought in the old steamer trunk that was in my room, a shit load of pillows, and the pope lamp (don't ask-too long to tell) and the room is awsome. Its the perfect size for 4 or 5 people to chill.

Meh, back to some writings. I've decided to jump on the scholarship wagon this year and see what I can make of it. If all I have to do to get money is fill out forms and write then I'm in, friends!

The 4 of us (Core, Clens, Lars, and I) are all going to go camping in Indiana the end of June!! I'm SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO excited! Its going to be amazing. It takes me back to The Taste last year!! LMAO!! ;)

Ma came up Saturday and we got tipsy playing Yatzee. I know YATZEE. But hey, there is very little to pass the time in Deplab.

Friday night we (L, Chris, and I) all went out to a bon fire at Jeremy's (aka Jebidiah) house. Ended tipsy and wandering around Geneva at 3am. Its eerie. 

Saturday consisted of going home for a bike and some Chinese food and then rendez-vous at my bro's for another night of crazies. Ash came up and we had a blast. Probably the 1st time after 4 years she has gone out drinkin' and boy could you tell! She was plastered after 2 beers and by the time we made it to Shama-llama-dingdong (The renamed frat by a drunk yours truly because I can't remember greek letters to save my left eye) she was so far gone we were dancing to bad rap and telling everyone we were MILFs. *Yum*

And now I'm here attempting to break my slew of hangoverness with a good string of homework. FUN! My last big hurdle before classes end is a research paper due in a week.

I had an interview on Friday but nothing has panned out yet. Still jobless. I'm trying not to get stressed about this summer...I've decided to start the ""Support a College Education"" Fund via Ebay. Everything's going. Everything. Everything you never knew you wanted but will when I'm through with you! I'll keep you posted on how that account comes along. It'll be fun. :)

Alright, back to my paper and scholarship stuff. We'll see how that pans out.

"event","I've realized after a year of hurt and confusion that you just can't handle being friends. You don't want to work at it. You are perfectly happy throwing away a wonderful friendship because of jealousy. If its not jealousy, then I don't know what it is because you feel are too high and mighty to explain it to me...to work things out...you never wanted to stay friends because if you did you never would've treated me the way you did. You never would've assumed that it was over. You made that decision kid, not me. You got mad becuase I found someone and that meant you lost time. You weren't there for me when I needed you. You didn't care to be.

I'm sure you say the exact same things about me. I'm sure you've talked me up to your friends to be the biggest bitch of the west. I'm ok with that because I know who wrote the apology letters and tried to talk and invited you to a party that wasn't even mine and TALKED to you when you pretended I didn't exist. 

I wish it could've all been different. I wish we were still friends and you could accept my apology for whatever the hell I did that was so severe as to end a friendship. But I've realized after a year of having no friends and crying and being hurt by you that I can't allow this anymore. I can't let you ruin my life anymore. 

I've said it a million times and I'll say it one more time: I can't fix it unless I know. You never clued me in. You never wanted to clue me in. You wanted to be the victim of some nameless crime. 

I extend one last apology and accept yours, whether you offer it or not.

I wish you all the best. Life is too short to harbour these feelings that slowly eat you inside out. I want to be friends, I'll always want to be friends becuase I miss that friendship. I swear I've never laughed so hard as when we were friends.

I'm sorry. Maybe one day we can talk. But that day doesn't seem to be in the near furture, at least from your end.

All the best-Good bye."

Its really neat to play that ""where was I a year ago"" game...I've come out on top. I've cut a lot of the fat/drama out of my life which allows for so much more breathing space. I've prioritized. I've learned alot. I've finally been back to Medival Times, played in the snow, and seen Dame Edna. I drank too much again at New Years but loved every second of it. I've learned to be quieter. I have a posse. I have a new computer. I've loved, really really loved. I'm learning to love in ways that I never thought possible. I'm finally in school. I'm out on my own. I'm 20. I've never laughed as hard as I have this past year. I'm so blessed.

-Spring Break is next week! WHOOOO. Plans are to do a whole lot of nothing at home. OH! And go into the city for St. Patty's Day to see Dame Edna with DJ. FABULOUS!

Have to blow dry my hair. 2 shakes.

oh! Maggie & Fish! I totally bought Girl Scout cookies the other day it took me back, old school! Only they didn't have tagalongs...

It snowded hard core yesterday. Bleck. Saturday was beautiful-you could smell the ground again and everything...and then it snows 3 inches on Sunday. Mutha Nature is a big tease.

As you can tell be now I'm procrastinating about writing my outline for Coms. I'd rather chew glass by this point- seriously. My other classes aren't that bad. We're reading detective stories in English (Poirot all the way!), Locke in my 2 political philosophy classes, and Islam in SEA in the Intro to South East Asian studies class. Cheers to that!

I'm so tired these days. I become physically tired taking a shower. Everyone says its because I sleep too much but that's a GROGGY tired...like..you just can't get moving. This is the ""I've worked all day and am ready to drop"" tired. I'm terrified I have mono...

The number one trait that is truly ridiculous in a TWENTY YEAR OLD is immaturity. I'm talkin' about the whining, can't discuss issues with people, awkward, snide remarks behind the back, BITCHY attitudes. YOu all know what I'm talking about here because we all have at least one in our lives. 

I feel better. You can grow out of immaturity but you can't grow out of being a bitch. IT really has to suck to be you. There are no two ways around that one, buddy.

Reading a lot of Tocqueville and CS Lewis lately. Morality (and lack thereof) is on the plate this month. Lots of good conversation with my honors professor about it all. He's the only person on this campus that I regularly talk to. That's sad.

Thinking about transfering to a school better suited to me. We'll see what I can find. 

Its getting cold. 

Thanksgiving is here. Holy shit. Where has this year gone? I swear I just came home from my birthday night in Macomb LAST NIGHT! Crazy.

Work is work....its money and that's all that matters.

My pols260 term paper is one of the best I've ever written...we'll see if my teacher agrees.

Everyone is coming home for break. I feel like I've lost some part of myself and seeing these kids, especially J, will help me regain what I've lost.

Madonna is wearing nude nylons in HUNG UP...I don't know how to feel about that beyond the fact she looks ridiculous.

Looking back I feel like I haven't accomplished anything this year.....bleck...pols time."

"event","12 reasons why gay people should not be allowed to get married

1. Homosexuality is not natural, much like eyeglasses, polyester, and birth control. 

2. Heterosexual marriages are valid because they produce children. Infertile couples and old people can't legally get married because the world needs more children. 

3. Obviously, gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children. 

4. Straight marriage will be less meaningful if Gay marriage is allowed, since Britney Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was meaningful. 

5. Heterosexual marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are property, blacks can't marry whites, and divorce is illegal. 

6. Gay marriage should be decided by people, not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of the minorities. 

7. Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America. 

8. Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall. 

9. Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract. 

10. Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why single parents are forbidden to raise children. 

11. Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and we could never adapt to new social norms because we haven't adapted to things like cars or a longer lifespan. 

12. Civil unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a ""separate but equal"" institution is always constitutional. Separate schools for African-Americans worked just as well as separate marriages for gays and lesbians will."

If you don't want to/can't work then quit. Please stop making my life a living hell and making me pick up after you.

School and work are a bad combination.

School, work, and booze are a worse one.

Mondays come too quickly now.

Everyday feels like a Monday.

I repeat: Mother Nature is a big fat tease. Beautiful autumn weather Friday and then the weekend turns out to be bleck. C'mon now.

Iron Chef isn't shown on Saturdays at the same time it shows during the week. They show Iron Chef America. Horrifying.

I'll be 20 next month. I'm scared I will never accomplish anything because I have yet to accomplish anything thus far.

Travel has become more of a distant dream than a plusible idea. That's heartbreaking.

Homework time....I will be saying that for the next 4 years of my life. (Not happy about that)"

My best frien is gone and I don't even know what I did. I'm a bad person like that.

Today is friday. I had to go to work for 8 hours. I am back at the candy store. I will never esscape the hell known as Fuzziwig's. I have a 12 hour shift tomorrow. It makes me hurt but I need the money. I spent so much money this past year on nothing at all.

JSH never calls me anymore. he stopped liking me too.

Woke up an 8. Had to be out the door by 8.30. Rushed in the shower and forgot to rinse of the conditioner. Deposited at work by 8.45 even though I don't open the store until 10 because my brother had to be at work early. I can't wait until he's gone.

Came into work and its FLOODED. No, literally FLOODED. There's an inch and a half of standing water wrapped around the counter...the Pepsi machine clogged up. Spent 45 minutes cleaning it up instead of trying to rinse my hair out.

If I ever get so pretentious as to feel my opinion is more important than ANYONE ELSE'S please shoot me.

Had a dream I was shot. It hurt, even in my dream. But then Maggie came and took me to her big Laguana Beach style house and we sat in the jacuzzi and Stephen (the hot guy from L. Beach) was there too. Yum. Maggie, is Laguana Beach a real place in California?

My parents and I had yet another knock down drag out. I realize if I just take the blame for it all it goes by quicker. It will be better in a month when I don't have to put up with their shit.

Another gym session tonight. Already bought my tickets to the gun show.

Mr. 88 acquired a casa over the past week. Nice place. Set on 10 acres. Pretty in the rain. Quiet. It will be a nice getaway during school.

I have no money. I love this. I spent so much of it that I turn around expecting it and its gone. I try to cook my books everyday to squeeze it all a little further...not happening...

10am. Time to open this shithole. This time in 2 weeks I'll have my keys to my own place. I can't move up there until Chris goes up because he has the car...but at least I'll have an escape.

Still have to work here 25 hours on weekends to stay afloat...not exciting.

Bleck. Make this day be better."

Natasha Bedingfield

Threw some chords together
The combination D-E-F
Is who I am, is what I do
No one's gonna let it down for you
Try to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration
(But it's not coming easily)
Whoah oh...

Trying to find the magic
Trying to write a classic
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know?
Waste-bin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you...

Read some Byron, Shelly and Keats
Resided in over a Hip-Hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean
With dead poets and drum machines
I know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find a killer hook
Now you're gonna raise the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough

These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you...

I'm getting off my stage
The curtains pull away
No hyper bowl to hide behind
My naked soul exposes
Whoah.. oh.. oh.. oh.. Whoah.. oh..

Trying to find the magic
Trying to write a classic
Waste-bin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you...
I love you, is that okay...?"

But whatever I'm doing wrong, however I'm doing it, needs to STOP! Opp! Are you talking?! WRONG! Going out with your friends? WRONG! Breathing? WRONG!

This past year has been absolutely nuts. I've had wonderful times, great memories, crazy nights...lots of new people...new hook ups...new adventures...

But there has also been heartbreakingly lonely times and depression beyond comprehension and disappointment...

I've learned alot but I'm so ready to go to school and see if I still can write a paper. I'm ready to get out of this town again.

Summer is flying by...all these great things that we've planned haven't panned out. Lately I feel like having a boy has stopped my friends from calling as much because they assume I'm with him...that blows...I feel like I'm missing out on the fun, single life...the grass is always greener on the other side, I know.

He's a nice guy. He's a great guy. Is that enough? Me starting school in the Fall will defintely test our relationship. I don't know how well I'm going to be able to juggle 15 hours (3 of them Honors), 25 hours a weekend at Fuzziwig's to stay financially afloat, college social life and my need to be in the middle of it, family struggles, friendships, AND a boy. What have I gotten myself into?! Feast or famine, I tell ya.

London blasts this morning. Terrorists bombed 3 metro trains and a double decker. There are reports now saying the double decker was a suicide bomber. Honestly, what the hell are people thinking? How does BOMBING fix anything?! It dosen't earn respect from anyone; it only creates a hostile environment...good governers! What is this world coming to?!??!

I will be 20 in October. 20 years old. I'll have pranced around on this lil globe for 20 years...wow. Talk about feeling completely unaccomplished, strangely old, and frightingly innocent (well..maybe not INNOCENT...) all at this same time...Like I told L the other day- either roll with the world or it'll roll right over you. Yeah, I just got rolled over...bitches...

Went down to the Taste this weekend. Fabulous amounts of fun! Ate alot of corny stuff! Danced in the fountain. Made out on a bridge and stopped traffic, yeah, that's hot! ;)

Rosemary, Heaven restores you in light.
You're coming with me.
Through the aging, the fear, and the strife.

Its the smiling on the package
Its the faces in the sand
Its the thought that holds you upwards
Embracing you with two hands

My, my, my...where will this world take me next? I pray I am smart and capable enough to make this all work. I really don't want the peak of my life to be a silly exchange when I was 16. I want to do more in my life than just that. I want to do something wonderful. I want to become someone great. I just want to be happy."

Today is a flustering day. My brother took my car today for his internship...I won't have it all summer. Its frustrating that he gets priority. 

I got super sunburned at the theme park yesterday in the Dells...forget sunkissed..I was sun raped...it hurts.

I'm sitting here at work on another Monday I orginally had off. Yes, that's 3 Monday's in a row I've had to come into this shit hole. 

The less time spent at home the better. Everyone is getting on my nerves. My litte brother is annoying, my older brother thinks he's God, my mother is menopausal, and my father is too far buried in the TV after work to know his left from his right. 3 months and I'm outta there...not like I'm really GOING anywhere though....20 minutes down the road to a school I didn't pick. That's not that exciting. The only truly exciting part is getting my OWN ROOM in an appartment with two fabulous chicas. I'm looking forward to that.

I am going to pay rent this year and hopefully be able to cover rent & tuition next year. The thought of having MommyDaddy pay for everything is sickening. I don't want to be my older brother.

Its so quiet in here I can hear the slurpy machine....

Mr. 88 is picking me up after work today...very ready to see him.... :D

I think the girls are mad at me but I'm not sure...I'm (sadly) not a mind-reader...meh...

I have really fun burn lines from this weekend...like the 2 marks on the side of my face from my sunglasses...yeah, that's hot.

I'm flustered because the ONE summer I'll probably have $$ and time to spend that $$ I have NO CAR!!! >(

Whatever...hopefully this day'll get better. Monday's aren't my best days.

This weekend is Memorial Day weekend..the store is gonna be nuts...the family is talking about going camping for the weekend which would be great because then I would have the house to myself. 

My only off day this week is tomorrow...I need it...

Alright, I've gotta open the store....bleck...."

Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing someday it'll bring me back to you
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

And you may not know
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning"

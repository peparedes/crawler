 Well last night was really fun :]
even though we had absoulutly no luck in getting any goods.
haha things started with me nadine jill and taylor meeting up at the gymnastics meeting
with me and taylor are starting for the first time this year just to jump around to mess around haha. then we went to jillys house and got ready then al butt, wes, j del, and john casey came by :) we didnt stay fo long so we ended up back at wes' to watch tv, laugh, and get warm haha. I stopped by chris mckenzies house too i miss that kidddddd
later on we ended up at a fire at the garvey house, it was cold so we left. then jilly made us grilleed cheese and soup hoping that the russels wouldn't wake up ahah. then snuck home round 430.<b>i love hanging out with all of these kids its so random but we have sooo many laughs and gts.

"event","<small><center>So I guess I'll start by
Saying that I love you,
But you know, this thing ain't been
No walk in the park for us

<b>How do you let it go? 
When you just don't know what's on
the other side of the door
When you're walking out?</b>

But we know that we gotta go
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it,
And it's killing me
Cause....there's never a right time to say Goodbye....

Boy you know,
We should be apart, baby I
I just can't do it
And sometimes it makes me wanna cry

wow i just have way to many feelings building up inside me.
i have not used this thing in so long either.
today isnt really a good day i feel sick again like always.

its so hard to loose someone you really care about.
especially over somethings that clearly could have been avoided by making the right decison.
if you say im your everything and truley mean it things would have never happened like this.
its happened so many times noww i feel perminently let down by you and your lies.
and even though we are over now, i cant help but feel broken when you get involved with someone else.
but why do you claim you still love me....    all i wanted was to teach you a lesson but clearly it didnt work.
life is too short to waste my time on this and you. but i can just forget about you as much as i want to.
youll always be a close friend because i never leave anyones friendship.
oh yeah and girls just some advice i'd be careful with this boy!

but hey school will be here soon enough and things will be alooooot better.
its so sad thats summer is almost summer but gotta make the best of it :)
oh yeah and tonight i have volleyball practice but i suck haha hope for the best i guess lol

love peace and happiness     MARIE<3"

If you catch me at the border I got  visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one  down in a second if you wait

Sometimes I feel sitting on trains
Every  stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner now we're making  that fame
Bonafide hustler making my name

All I wanna do is *BANG BANG  BANG BANG!*
And *KKKAAAA CHING!*
And take your money

Pirate skulls  and bones
Sticks and stones and weed and bombs
Running when we hit  'em
Lethal poison through their system

No one on the corner has swag  like us
Hit me on my banner prepaid wireless
We pack and deliver like UPS  trucks
A radio in hell just pumping that gas

All I wanna do is *BANG  BANG BANG BANG!*
And *KKKAAAA CHING!*
And take your  money

M.I.A.
Third world democracy
Yeah, I got more records than  the K.G.B.
So, uh, no funny business

Some some some I some I  murder
Some I some I let go
Some some some I some I murder
Some I some  I let go

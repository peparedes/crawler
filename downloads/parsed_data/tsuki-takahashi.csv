waiting 
hoping

anticipation. 
scared and excited.

ink bleeding through the paper. 
etched and scribbled

Where are we going, so far away
And somebody told me that this is the place
Where everything's better, everything's safe

Walk on the ocean
Step on the stones
Flesh becomes water
Wood becomes bone

And half and hour later we packed up our things
We said we'd send letters and all those little things
And they knew we were lying but they smiled just the same
It seemed they'd already forgotten we'd came

Now we're back at the homestead
Where the air makes you choke
And people don't know you
And trust is a joke
We don't even have pictures
Just memories to hold
That grow sweeter each season
As we slowly grow old</i>"

Subject: Drowning Our Secrets

Dear Frank, 

Yesterday me and my closets friends went to the pier and wrote down all of our secrets on index cards. Once we were all done we threw our secrets in one by one. We stood there and watched all of our secrets that we've kept hidden forever just float away . . . No one really said anything as we watched the secrets float away . . . We lost a piece of ourselves, but we found something too. 



that means so much to me. 
and we saw mermaids. 
i bet they did too....

P.S.: i saw her."

A happy girl, she's spinning
These strings in her curls
And it's only the beginning 
Of a trip around the world
I feel like just a child
Sinking down one hundred million miles
Deli markets with thier flower stands 
Across a bridge and across the mountains
Threw a nickel in the fountain
girl whispers
make a wish 
make a wish 
kiss the coin and fate does the rest
to save your self from troubled times 
go back to meadows, streams, and beautiful green

part 2:

There is no use in waiting
Offer up your steps so I can climb
Show me all your figure paintings
Etched in the middle of the night
Let me stretch upon your carpet
Let me hear the rain tap on your street
Knowing I am safe on the inside
Blankets wrapped and drifting off to sleep
i have a new dream
[This time we ride roller coasters into the ocean]
We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world 
And I guess it's worth your time
Because there's some lives you live 
And some you leave behind
It gets hard to explain
[soon i run out of words and they just dont come together
as i wish they would]

part 3:
Follow me through a city of frost covered angels
I swear I have nothing to prove 
I just want to dance in your tangles
To give me some reason to move 
But to take on the world at all angles
Requires a strength I can't use
So I'll meet you up high in your anger 
Of all that is hoping and waiting for you"

"event","im not used to fine. 
its not in my vocabulary.
I could help myself to something
Like a little bit of revelation
You could be the one to help me help myself.
So let me go out there
I can breathe fresh air
Stay with you all night
Just let me love you
Just for a while, want to
Be with you all night
Until I fall asleep
Just let me be here
I won't tell anyone
Don't want to wake up
The blind lead the blind so why can't I find my way
This could be Heaven but I don't know where I am
I am too scared to come out from behind here
My body is aching, it feels like it's wearing me
i feel like butter scraped over too much bread 
that kind of butter you melt before spreading cause it just rips the bread
Say the first thing that
Comes into your head when you see me
If it looks like it works and it feels like it works
Then it works
dont try to impress me with a cheesy montauge 
or words that you dont remember what they mean
it doesnt impress
the girl in the green dress
with brown flip flops on 
and a black bag thats tearing apart at the seams 
look into her eyes
she is a mess
full of insecruties, hopes, dreams...
look at her butterfly necklace hanging just below the cleavage that teases you constantly. 
look at her charm bracelet with flowers
how everything clings to her so beautifully 
like her hair shining in the light.
every year she comes to the lit up dance floor of perriwinkle pink dresses and purple sashes
and never dresses up too fancy 
never a dance partner 
never a lover 
only a dreamer 
she says as you are talking
""I've waited here my whole damn life
And I've forgotten what I wanted...but theres no where else i can go...""
""maybe i wont suffer..i'd be lying to myself....but theres no way out that i can see.""
she tells you to reach out and take it, cause shes so afraid of this fear."

<i>Has nobody asked you how you are?
You look like you might not last the day
I wouldn't have made it very far
So we'd make a good team right away
I've not made amends for yesterday
My lip won't get me out of it
Waking up dreading hearing tales
Of all my nightmares being true
I take a breath and grab the phone
Secretly hoping you're not home
I'd leave a message - I was out
Out of my mind on drink and drugs</i>




scared to talk with you not in person. 
what a conversation that would be. 
dead silence everywhere and you just sitting there. 
staring at me till the sun came up. 
i'd just die.




part 2:

<i>It took half the time
I am still afraid
So stay by my side
And hold on to my hand
Try to teach me that
I'm alright, I guess
But there's so much wrong
But there's so much right
I guess we'll agree
To differ on one thing</i>



you tell me that im beautiful. 
and i must say, i believe you. 
i dont know why im so afraid to love you back. 
i dont know why im so afraid to be by your side. 
but hold me tight and tell me everything will be alright anyway. 
cause im sure of one thing 
i need you here. with me. to protect. to keep safe. 
[This could be the very minute
I'm aware I'm alive]
you may be the key to finding myself. 
and this is something that scares the living hell out me like nobodys business. 
[You're the only thing that I love
It scares me more every day
On my knees I think clearer]

[It's easier to lie and be safe
Time and time again I'm half stalled
One giant leap of faith is easy
When everyone you ask is so sure]
but she..but i....am not. or i am. 
ya see, what this kind of thing does to me?
When I know I'm fine, I'm not used to fine"

woodsy outdoors.
posters and record players. 
swings. 
these things are things i never had.
but they remind me of the good times. 

all those little notes you gave me, i kept them all. 
i remember all the stupid dances. inside jokes. and peanut butter cookies. 
[""i love my friends. no matter what.""]
all these things are what mattered to you. 
and you knew, they mattered to me too....

you said dont cry. that you've had enough of tears. 
so have i....
but i cant help but cry. 

i just want to get away. away from here. all this stress. just get me out. i dont want to be here.
the last thing i said was i love you. 
i smiled. 
i think of you everyday. 
i will think of you everyday.



so i guess thats a poem."

ok..here goes....

so i was chating with katie k and i told her about how kayte asked me about how people in the group were doing. one person imparticular...bet you can guess who. dont think i really have to tell you....(and no, its not katie k) 

anyway, i was frustrated about it. and i told her, ""what does she want me to say?...we barely talk anymore.."" 

and shes like,  i dunno. maybe she just wants to see how you feel about them. 

and i was like honestly, im not obsessed. i dont think i am, i dunno what you guys see but thats how i feel. and honestly, i thought i would stop thinking of them when they left and i didnt.
you can qoute me on that. 


in my gut, in my instincts, this didnt feel right. i felt like that bitch trying to explain herself and just telling lies and not bieng herself. 

as soon as i finished, she said she was gonna go. 

i felt inside my gut, that it was because of what i said that made her leave. 
so i texted her and i apologized. 
i was like, im sorry if what i said made you leave. 
and she was like no. 
and i texted back with, ""im sorry."" and shes like for? 
and im like whatever i said or did to make you leave.

"event","im thinking of just getting a journal for poetry. 
tht way, i dont have to use up all these sites for it. 
and i can write them when i feel like it. 
cause most of them are current anyway. 
there old things from the past i just remembered to write or suddenly thought about on the way to school, in the rain and all my friends calling my name 
my shoe was stuck to gum that day 
i failed the test 
i was tense, couldnt relax 
can everyone see the tension setting in, taking over. 
i figure theres only one thing i can do. 
get a journal. 
write tons of beautiful poetic lyrical poetry 
and leave a page out, at the book store or at someones house before i leave 
or even at school in my classroom, or in some unsuspecting backpack.
and then go home and wonder what that persons thinking as they read it. 
or what they'll do if they find it. 
i hope its extra special. 
i will make it so. 
so they cant resist. 
and then make it like i wrote it for them. only not. cause it was for me. for that day. 
i felt bad. i needed to vent, to get it all out with pen and paper. 
i'll send one to each friend annonymously and see what happens. 
if they mention it to me in on the phone or in a bulletin. 
cause they feel special now, they've experienced some strange coincedience. 
but i can only send it to one. 
so they dont catch on. 
and it must be something totally irrevelant to them. 
something i just thought up over hours of gruling, sipping over diet pepsi in my pajamas at 3:00 in the morning 
or on my way to ny before i go 
sending a goodbye like i'll be gone forever, leaving them guessing as the meaning to my story. 
or not. 
maybe i'll just write a hundred random things jumbled into one so somehow it all comes together."

"event","To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbye
I nearly do...
i hug you tight and want to stay and tell you all the things i never said. 
im back where i started. 
covering the same ground cause you never listened. or maybe it was opposite and i was the one ignoring your feelings about how what i was doing was bad. 
but i hate these mixed signals, miscomunications, and quarrels over nothing. 
It's the same thing again
But it could become a problem if
We don't deal with it now
And you blast off in another rant
I've not opened my mouth
Can you read my mind so easily
As the madness sets in.


Two: 

Slower slower
We don't have time for that
All I want is to find an easier way
To get out of our little heads. 
Are you watching me at those times when my face is emotionless 
do you catch those moments when i dance with some stranger eyeing you and your lovely date every chance i can
unkowingly being watched by you 
watching my emotionless face while i dance with this  stranger and wonder what could be 
and why i go through all this crap 
all because i said ""i love you"" 
it was only three words 
how can they be so powerful 
[you know your in love when the hardest thing to say is goodbye]
i wish i could make you understand my thoughts 
but you barely pay attention 
and not knowing what really goes through your head 
your attempts to feel less guilty 
drive me insane 
the fact that i'll never know what your lips feel like agianst mine 
the fact the only touch i'll ever get is a friendly hug or wrap around the shoulder....

Three: 
Happy with yourself
Well you've never looked so satisfied
Teasing me with stuff like a spoilt little brother
You finished yet?
Have you got what you really want? 

let me know when your done hanging the messes we had over my head 
let me know when you know what you really want from me 
instead of saying what i should do or what im doing 

its even more amazing  for me to know 
You're the only thing that I love 
i wish i hadnt given you that note 
to hear the words i never wish i had 
Goodness knows I saw it coming
Or at least I'll claim I did
But in truth I'm lost for words

[this is all so complicated every time i attempt to explain it.]


Just because I couldn't say doesn't make me a liar
I noticed a change in the tone of your voice
It's so clear
My role in this mess
Is not something that I can be proud of

i dont know how to say all of these so everythings all jumbled into bits and pieces that dont really fit 
all spat out in the face 
maybe a trace or a clue can be found 
to sort it all out."

theres so much to say but not enough time to say it in.

im sad, yes. but im happy. content. 
a simple line in a series of lyrics can explain it all.

not get on. 
just wait for it to come. 
say hello to everyone for no reason at all.

but the sadest ones, you may never know....

i really have no idea where that is going, but i love it. 

okay now. what i came to say. im going to tell you a few things about me....

1. i have compassion. i believe people can change. 

2. i never know exactly  how to say what i want to say. i find several icons that express bits and pieces of what i want to say, and post them all over my myspace profile. ( even the ones that remind me of people. if i want to say what something without actually telling them). so i say how i feel in that moment.which isnt always good. but i will always come back and apologize later. no matter what. 

3. I'll tell you everything about me, if you only ask me kindly. anything you want to know. my whole life story if you like. but only if you listen. i only put up with those who are willing to listen. 

4.im not the nicest person sometimes. but deep down, im very kind. im strong emotionally. i overanalyze situations and make even the little things bigger than they are. 

5. i learn from my experiences. and others too. 

6. i tend to write alot. ( i express everything through my icons and poetry. cause thats how we do.) 

7. im never prepared for anything. ever. 

8. my face. will tell you exactly what im feeling. if you look closely. just pull of my mask. trust me. you'll see the real me. 

9. i like talking online and on the phone for hours on end. late at night. 

10. dont fuck with my mind. i have no patience for deception. if you love me, tell me so. but in the simplest form. im not a mind reader. 

11. if i say i love someone, i fucking mean it. dont ever question that."

if the sun refused to shine,
I would still be loving you.
When mountains crumble to the sea,
There will still be you and me.

Kind woman, I give you my all,
Kind woman, nothing more.
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain,
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by.
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong,
Together we shall go until we die.
My, my, my, an inspiration is what you are to me,
Inspiration, look see.
And so today, my world it smiles,
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles,
Thanks to you it will be done,
For you to me are the only one.
Happiness, no more be sad,
Happiness....Im glad."

"event","To my friends who aren't signed up to tribe or LJ, 
 
I've had to close my information to be accessed by ""friends only."" Please consider signing up for free accounts so that you can remain in touch and up to date. It upsets me to think about someone reading over my thoughts with the intent on damaging my name instead of simply learning more about me and I don't want what I say about the friends and loved ones I have to be twisted and used against them. I am sorry for this inconvenience.

"event","So I guess this is continuation to the previous entries.  Lets hope my college english skills get to some use.  The truth is I don't remember the exact order of the fun in Rhode Island but perhaps I can tell you about the different days.  First off lets get somthing straight.  I don't spell the there words right and I couldn't tell you one from the other.  This goes back to the earliar days and I've just failed to learn it.  
 There was that day we went to the casiono in Conneticut.  This event had been planned out forever.  The plan was for all of us to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe then the three girls aunt d, grandma, and my mother would go to the Casino.  This place was called Foxwood Conneticut.  It was a gorgous building with vallet parking.  I had called them previous this summer to see if they took eighteen year olds.  I was ninteen and was of course used to the whole you have to be twenty one thing but ever since I knew about Mt Pleasant I knew places did infact exist where you could be younger.  This wasn't one of them.  My grandfather drives the van and the vallet guy parks it.  We walk in.  The place is big and gorgous.  Many shops exist.  They have an arcade, and of cours the resturan and the ever so popular casino.  D and grandma were already there and you had to laugh at aunty D walking around with her cruthches.  We sat down to luch and I'm sure someone mentioned how they didnt know all the songs being older and such.  After eating we went shopping to the gift shop.  I guess our obsession had to be the Hard Rock shirts.  We bought them.  The girls headed off for gambling.  We tried to watch them but there were too many guards of course.  My dad walks into the Casion and my brother and I just stand there talking about how much we wish that we were twenty one.  It was the fact that life just wasn't fair like that.  
 Hours later three girls return who didn't win any money.  One of them being my mother accidently bet all and it was later stated that they helped pay for the facility."

"event","The walk is gorgous of course being on the private drive.  Many people live here and to middle classers and everyone else the sickening fact is this may be one of many houses these people have that are nice.  Thelly be like we have seven summer houses.  Little p gave us the tour.  Every time we passed a gorgous house hed say somthing like and this manshion.  Anna was in a hurry to pick up Pete from the balloon festival at uri.  They left after the walk.  It was getting later for the rest of us so we scadadled. We drove home by the city beach which was gorgous and full of cars during the weekend days.  Theres nothing greater than Rhode Island as it feels so much like home.  I wont say nothing but pretty close.  I went to sleep knowing I was finally in Rhode Island.

"event","So I guess I should probably say that my grandparents are great and they take the best trips ever.  I've never actually told them this but I should.  My grandfather starts talking about uncle ps new toy which is actually a hot tub that got added to his house.  The house is just gorgous too by the way.  

   Our first stop is to get somthing to eat at a Tim Hortons in Narraganset.  Im finally to what I consider to be my home or one of them <3 ya bloem st too.  We pull in P and Ds drive way.  The dogs which are German Shepards come out.  They are really cute.  Little p comes out.  He is one of the grand children of P and ds.  I guess that means Anna and Pete are there.  They are his parents.  Little P comes out and hugs us.  He is eight years old now.  Turns out Anna is there but Pete is with the Lions club.  I ask what the Lions club is and find out they help people get wheel chairs and such.  Pete was helping out with the festival up at URI.  Hes alumni of course.  URI was actually having a balloon festival.  I hugged everyone and Pete and D.  They are excited as we didnt come last year due to me having my highschool open house.  D is like take ya coat off and stay.  Anna asks me about school and I ask her about teaching.  My father and I wonder if there are any races taking place in Rhode Island this weeek.  We go upstairs and search the web.  We find a few.  Blessing of the fleet comes to our eyes.  It says ten k so I think this might be hard seeing as that I have only run five ks.  But I decide to do it.  We go downstairs little p wants to race around the house.  I have flip flops but take them off.  I let him win but only by a little bit.  
   It's time for dinner.  We talk about the race and Uncle P thiks I will do well in it.  First we get the salad annd the pasta which is delicous.  My mother gets a glass of wine because its the doctors orders that she starts drinking wine for some reason.  Everyone else has wine.  The foods delicous and everyones laughing.  Little P gets to sit by his grandfather uncle p.  All at once we decide to yell thank god Im free. Uncle P yells I saw the light.  We have a good time.  I do my best to help with dishes.  The deserts the fun part.  There was shortcake and the coffe was so good.  I have never tasted coffe like that.  My grandmother and Uncle P put a shot in ther coffe and so does Anna.  I ask if it goes good with coffe and Uncle P goes oh it goes good with anything.  

   Later we go for a walk around the gorgous private drive neigborhood




To be continued later.  take it easy folks."

"event","We wake up early and head to Grand Rapids to fly first class which is seriousally nothing from Grand Rapids.  They check and do the usual stuff.  My mother buys a magazine for the trip.  I see a tour group heading to Germany.  They asked my father to take a picture.  They held a sign that said somthing like Germany here we come.  My dad said somthing to them in German to say instead of cheese.  So we get on what's a short flight to Chicago Ohare which I used to think was the greatest airport in the world but being older I viewed it as a place where there was just too many people and was much too hot.  It was still early so we got Starbucks.  I got a bagel which wasnt bad for somone who never eats breakfast.I sat on the ground with my brother because seating seemed to be limited.  Ohare is quite interesting because you can see lights on the ceiling you ussually end up doing quite a bit of walking in order to get to your  flight.  Our flight of course was headed to Providance Rhode Island.  My great grandmother had once lived in Providance.  They had a huge house which was once actually pretty cheap.  My great grandfather fixed it up and it was used for rentals.  They raised six kids with the help of auntie of course.  That house was so much fun but no longer was around since she passed away.  

    I hear them say we are putting out a red carpet for the people in first class.  I laugh and do a little dance as we walk over it.  The airplane i guess has terriable servous for first class as i hear but its been so long that it doesnt bother me.  And lets forshadow to RhodeIsland where there will be plenty of great food from the ex chef of the best italian resturant.  The plan rides intersting as heck.  In fact the head phones now have some type of like 104.5.  It probably repeats about thirty songs but it was interesting hearing that Glamorous song by Fergie because at the moment I was first class up in the sky and for a week I would be living the life.  

   We get there and see Grandpa G who is just as grouchy as ever but then thats just who he is.  We porfin get the luggage and drive through RhodeIsland.  The suspense is gonna kill me tell we get there."

leonna knows everythjing about efverone.  alot of the gossip i ever learned was from her.

          Uncle Ray and uncle Louie were well known painters in the rhodeisland area.  My great grandfather may have been with them at this point too.  they were well known painters.  They go and they are about to paint this guys house.  He says be careful of the bird.  this bird everyday sits on his shoulders.  so they are painting along.  the cage gets knocked over.  the bird flys in the air and gets knocked out from the paint fumes and falls in a bucket of paint.  so they run around every pet store in providence i think they finally go to a second cousins or somthing.  they are looking for a similar bird to this dead bird.  they find one.  they put it in the cage.  the mans talking to his wife and he goes i told u these painters would mess up the bird never realizing its a differnet bird."

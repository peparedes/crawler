An Australian inventor has created a weapons system called Metal Storm that is capable of firing a million rounds a minute, CNN reported June 27.

Mike O'Dwyer spent 30 years and his own money to develop the electronic technology for the weapons. The U.S. Department of Defense has since expressed interest in Metal Storm.

The value of Metal Storm, says O'Dwyer, is its ability to precisely deliver rates of fire and different types of projectiles.

The weapons in the system include a handgun, which can precisely fire on a target and only be operated by an authorized user, and a grenade launcher that can fire either lethal or non-lethal ammunition.

According to O'Dwyer, the firing mechanism of Metal Storm uses electronic ballistics technology, so unlike other guns, there are no moving parts.

Both the U.S. and Australian military are interested in the potential speed and flexibility of Metal Storm weapons. They have given O'Dwyer $60 million in research and development funding.

O'Dwyer also expects sales from U.S. defense and police agencies next year.

We also went to a sneak preview of the ring.  It was a great film.  It could have been scarier but i still enjoyed myself.  I like how they put subliminal messages into the movie just like the exorcist did.  A few times during the film you would see the ring for a few frames.  Its supposed to increase the suspense.  I really like the main actress.  I can't remember her name right now.  She can really scream."

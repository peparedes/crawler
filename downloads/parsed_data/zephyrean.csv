"event","So,

It's official. I'll begin working for <a href=""http://www.tessgiberson.com/"">Tess Giberson</a> in July.
Also, potentially <a href=""http://www.sarigueron.com/"">Sari Gueron</a> and <a href=""http://www.unitedbamboo.com/"">United Bamboo</a>
I've sent a resume and coverletter to <a href=""http://www.maryping.com/"">Mary Ping</a> but we'll see what happens.
Contacted Proenza Schouler even though I'm not too fond of their clothing. Same goes for Anna Sui. 
Tried writing a coverletter in French to Dries Van Noten. Mon Francais was probably so bad they didn't respond."

I need some distraction from everything that's been pissing me off lately."

"event","In a mere 48 hours, I travelled by means of every method of transportation available. Legs, car, subway, train, and airplane. 

Montreal was an experience. Highlights include meeting an Antonio Banderas lookalike named Javier from Barcelona in the hostel. We went out for drinks at a bar called Le Divan Orange where we saw a jazz show. He recommended to me some of his favorite underground music and film. I will probably never see him again, but that's okay. Additions have also been made to my French vocabulary. 

I really want to move out of America."

"event","Lately, I have been spending my days attempting to teach myself the French language through various sources such as the internet and books. I must master the language so that I will be able to communicate with a potential lover and for the upcoming journey to Montreal! 

I am definitely leaving school and moving probably to New York. My imaginary apartment in the city may become a reality. I will, for a short while, return home for some southern hospitality before my embarkment on a brand new life. I went to an art shop yesterday and was excited by the sight of blank canvases, paint tubes, paper, and pencils. I am getting excited about art again. 

The weather has been beautiful to the point of me not knowing how to handle it."

"event","Sometimes, when you least expect it, you see something that adheres to your mind. The image is engrained into your memory. Yesterday, we were speeding along the highway. I was in the backseat, falling in and out of consciousness (the sun was just too warm). I opened my eyes and there was a silver convertible beside me. In the passenger side was a sleeping boy (the sun must have put him to sleep as well). The back of his head rested comfortable on the headrest, his dirty blond locks and his navy blue scarf danced in the wind. The sun casted a yellowish-gold light across his face. The driver quickly sped past our car. I silently cursed at my father for not being able to keep up, letting him escape. I kept my eye on the convertible; when it switched lanes so did my eyes. I stared until the silver disappeared into the distance. Oh well, I am glad to have caught a glimpse. 

okay, so perhaps I'm making this sound more romantic than it really was but I have the tendency of making everything in my life romanticized. 

...and I am thinking about boys far too much these days."

"event","I travelled to New York City on Friday and I am now employed by Tess Giberson. I will begin my internship in June. The studio is in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan. It is nestled on a strip that consists of the boutiques of Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney, Yigal Azrouel, and others. Her studio was bright and spacious. Animal Collective and other nice sounds filled the space. Tess' friend was in the back room painting. We spoke about the painting department at my school/his old school. I am looking forward to working there.

"event","about seventy-two hours ago:
i was driving along a scenic landscape far from home when it happened. the more pavement i consumed, the more saturated the sky became. i watched the azure slowly give birth to a saturated shade of pink and orange i had never seen before. i turned into a corner filled with trees. streaks of pink and orange light escaped between the leaves and branches. suddenly, there were no more trees and no more streaks. i stopped. the sky's intensity was intensified by the mirror beneath it. the entire world was filled with warmth. i knew at that moment what beauty is. 

this is happiness."

"event","there is a treasure chest of a thrift store in a town called athens (georgia). i wanted every single item but my anorexic wallet allowed for only two purchases. 

1920's coat and a sweater that reminds me of oysters.

later i fell in love with lisa's friend zack's marvelous 1820's home. every wall was covered with alice neel-esque paintings. <i>Inspiration</i>. i, too, shall live in an antique dwelling that smells of patchouli incense, oil paint, and turpentine and paint all day in a room i call my studio and cover my decadent walls with canvases!

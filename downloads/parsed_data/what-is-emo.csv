Stephen just woke up. He rolled out of bed, his hair messy and rough, sticky from the leftover product that embodies it. He had fallen asleep in his clothes, a loosely fit white t-shirt and name brand jeans. A contemplative smile is spread across his face; he looks down at the floor, remembering the previous night's occurances. His forehead is slightly wrinkled, not from age or concern, but from laughter and experience. He puts one hand in his pocket, relaxing his arm. In his other, a burning cigarette, used to calm his morning and ease his nerves. He is leaning against the doorway, the weight of his body resting against his arm. Dark shadows outline the furniture in the room behind him, the light barely profiles the manicured wood and reflects off of the blonde streaks that illuminate his golden brown hair. His t-shirt hangs down across his faded eye-lit belt. His belt is expensive--much like his jeans, it is made to look worn and barely holds up their loose fit. Beside him, the cigarette smoke swirls towards the ceiling, floating up, up, and up, then disappearing into the shadows. He stays standing there for a moment, enveloped in his thoughts, studying the day ahead of him and the nights that are to come. In this moment, he is relaxed.</lj-cut>"

I need the smell of summer, I need its noises in my ears. If looks could really kill, then my profession would staring. Please know we do this cause we care and not for the thrill. Collect calls to home to tell them that I realize that everyone who lives will someday die and die alone. And we won't let you in. Though we're down and out. We won't let you in. I wrote more postcards than hooks. I read more maps than books. Feel like every chance to leave is another chance I should have took. Every minute is a mile. I've never felt so hallow. I'm an old abandoned church with broken pews and empty aisles. My secrets for a buck. Watch me as I cut myself wide open on this stage. Yes, I am paid to spill my guts. I won't see home till spring. Oh, I would kill for the Atlantic, but I am paid to make girls panic while I sing. And we won't let you in. Though we're down and out.
We won't let you in. And we won't let you in. We don't want what isn't ours. We won't let you in. You win. And the coastline is quiet. While we're quietly losing control. Yes, we're silent but sure we inventened the cure that will wash out my memories of her. ""The harpoon is loaded. The cage is lowered. The water is red."" Like you. </center>"

And I ended up with picture perfect sheet music
I read your musical notes with a composer's eyes
And heard out song for the first time
My spine is still tingling, mental images of your fine tune
is what I've been nodding my head to lately
Every now and then you can catch me humming
your nudity under my heavy breath
I heavily suggest you resurrect
your ancient neglected dust collector
If you distrust the distance in my seldom plucked heart strings
Sit stripped before your full length
Perform your reflection backwards
Maybe then you will understand the rhythm in my movement
Listen when the news is sent
Extend when the rules are bent
I'll be waiting to take your lead
Make me a victim of your two step
Make me an apprentice of your body parts
Teach me to dance to your beauty marks
I'm stepping on toes here and I don't care
It's hopeless, it's hopeless
It's hopelessness, its hopelessness holding this openess to blow a kiss
So close your lips but don't get pissed
and throw a fist at this vocalist
I'm not emotionless, in fact I broke my wrist
when I wrote the list of all those I miss
This is my poker face, Mister Feel Nothing"

"event","thought you'd be looking for the next in line to love then ignore put out and put away
and so you'd soon be leaving me along like I'm supposed to be tonight, tomorrow and everyday

there's nothing here that you'll miss
I can guarantee you this is a cloud of smoke
trying to occupy space
what a fucking joke, what a fucking joke

I waited for a bus to separate the both of us and take me off far away from you 'cause my feelings never change a bit I always feel like shit I don't know why I guess that I just do

you once talked to me about love and you painted pictures of a never-never land and I could've gone to that place
<b>but I didn't understand
I didn't understand
I didn't understand</b>"

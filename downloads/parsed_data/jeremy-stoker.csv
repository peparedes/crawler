"event","Hello my <3! I'm so glad you found time to write in here. I seriously loved everything you said. And don't ever feel like you have to stop writing because your talking about yourself. That's what I wanna hear! We don't talk enough so I want to know EVERYTHING that's going on with you! I think that's awesome that your moving to Utah. Getting away from everything is also such a great growing experience. You grow up so much when your on your own.. and you become independent. Which is always a good thing. You school looks beautiful. and The city too.. You should come to Seattle. If you like the urban type cities that is the place to live. It is AMAZING. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. I love it. I love the pics of you and chase. I'm kinda confused by this off an on relationship, but I know that right now you guys are just trying to figure out where to go, since you do live seperate lives with him in utah and you in vegas.. I know the love is keeping you guys together, and hopefully it does as long as you want it to.. Which I'm sure that is forever! hehe. You guys are adorable. Is it kind of mutual this off and on thing? Or does just one of you want it to be like that and the other kind of goes along with it? I'm sure it's mutual. You both are just finding yourselfs.. and you need to see if that's where you are meant to be..right? Let me tell you something though Eri.. If you feel like he's confused or whatever, that's how ALL guys are.. OMG.. they are retards sometimes! Me and Jenny were talking about it on our way home from san antonio yesterday..and we were like how come guys are so stupid about certain things?! lol..We figured out that they just cant handle their emotions at all..and they get scared when they feel something that they never have. Not saying that this is what chase does.. but if he ever acts weird or like he doesn't know what he wants.. don't worry. cuz they are ALL like this. lol..So you guys are on right now then? what happens when you are off? is it pretty much the same thing? that's how me and eric were for a while during the beginning of senior year and some of junior..we wouldnt lable ourselfs as bf and gf but we'd always be together.. so i dont get it. lol.. guys are weird with their not wanting the lable. but hey, now we are married! its crazy when you give yourself completely to someone else huh.. and everything you said youd never do..you find yourself doing.. its nuts. but its so amazing.. its hard to imagine losing them though.. i always think about it and i really couldnt imagine living without him by my side. unless he did something stupid like cheated on me..then id kick his ass and be like BYE.. but i know that it wouldnt be easy. but i know that wont happen either. lol. you asked about married life so ill tell ya. its not too much different from being in a serious relationship.. besides the fact that you know theres no turning back..and you cant take breaks.. and thats the person youll be with for the rest of your life, no matter what. but i think its amazing. i love being married.. i knew he was going to be the one and i dont care when people think we are too young or whatever. i know we arent. ahh..paying bills all by yourself is kinda tough too. its weird cuz im visiting tx right now and im scared to even ask my mom for a dime anymore ya know.. its like once your married you feel like your husband has to take care of you and you feel like your parents have done enough that you dont want anything from them..but then i think well most people who are 18 arent married and my parents would still be supporting me.. but i dunno..so thats tough.. i dont like being scared like that. its kinda like you dont want them to think that you cant handle buying your own soda or something ya know? its just different. but the ups outway the downs so much for us. we have our little arguements and sometimes we've had a few big fights where ive left our apartment for a few hours and didnt talk to him for almost the whole day.. but we get over them so quickly. its like once we've cooled down to talk about it it's over.. we havent fought for such a long time though.. everything is going so great right now. and this lil vaca away from eachother is going to be great too..cuz we hang out with like eachother and that's it, ya know? i have one friend up in washington..and shes married too, so we dont get to hang out much. but i call her everytime and we've really became close and i tell her everything. i talk to her more than char and steph.. char and steph are hard to keep in touch with these days. just because we all have our own lives and i really feel like most of the time we are too different. but ill always be friends with them.. char though, i dont call her much at all because shes always been hard to talk to.. i cant stand calling someone who doesnt listen to anything about you and just talks your ear off about them..which i hope im not doing to you right now..lol.. but you know what i mean right? i try and tell her something and she wont be paying attention. i just dont like it. oh my god.. you know sheena? shes prego and shes due TOMORROW!! i guess she hasnt had it yet cuz she hasnt called me.. but isnt that weird?? shes having a girl, and her and her boyfriend arent together anymore. ok i know you dont care, but i thought that was crazy. lol. Davy has been staying away from the house lately cuz the repo man is looking for him cuz he hasnt paid his truck payment in 10 months!! what a dumb ass huh?! gosh eri you need to whip him in shape. ever since you left him he's been going down hill..lol. hes so stupid..gosh. lol. oh.. me and jenny were talking last night.. do you remember my cousin tony? LOL.. you have to.. haha.. you loved his karaoke dont you? lmao.. we were making fun of him at dinner last night and i was like eri was over when he was singing, and she started crackin up cuz she knows that youd make it even more hilarious then it was already. 
I know you want to know whats been going on with me..but really nothin has. the familia and i just got back from 2 days at sea world.. i almost died both days. it was so hot. i hate the heat just like you..lol. i cant stand it. but they had a water park so it wasnt all bad.. but ugh i got sick before the second day so i almost died the second day.. i couldnt stand it. but that was fun.. its nice to be home. 
i need to get a job when i get home. we are broke. well we are doing fine with money, but a little extra would help out a TON. so im gonna look when i get home.. and other than that everything is going good. im gonna go to cosmo school either when erics in iraq or down in washington after he gets back. i decided thats what im gonna do with my life i guess. i like it so im sure ill be happy with it. its so hard trying to figure out what you wanna do for a career. argh. hey! you have to tell me how criminal justice is cuz thats what eric wants to study. so tell me what its about k! ahh sorry i bored the hell out of you..but i gotta go. we are going to see my momma at work on her break. but before i go i wanna put some pics of us on here so you can remember how great our friendship was/is.. i love you eri and we need to keep in touch more! write me back k! <3 you!

"event","<P>It has been forever since we've written in this silly thing. Jeremy needs love. And I am back to show it. I am so sorry that I am probably the worst kind of friend to keep in touch since you've moved away. What can of best friend am I? Gah. I have the worst flaws. I'm a bit of a flake and selfish. But I am currently trying to learn how to manage it since I am logical enough to understand that I have a problem.I just am a bit of an irrational and unreliable person but I can be the exact polar opposite of that too. So practically I have bi-polarness of strenghts and weaknesses. I'm just a bit of everything.&nbsp;Like I said, I am fixing on it. But I promise, if you have thought that i have forgotten you, that's so not true. It just really seems like I am always so caught up in myself and my needs. Gah. But otherwise, I don't think its realy the right time to pick apart my weaknesses... Truthfully is I really miss you. I always have since you moved away from day one. Maybe even from the first time we started drifting apart. Julie, we had one of the greatest friendships out there at one point in our lives and I will never forget it. I still expect to sit near the lake as 80 year olds as our husbands play cards of some sort together. I still can't believe you're already married. Gah. You're not even mormon and you're married! haha. I am seriously so proud of you. You grew up so fast and I still think of you as itty bitty Julie. You probably are still itty bitty Julie. It's weird to know how we can not talk for months and we can always pick up where we left off. We still have an amazing friendship, jubie. Ah. Anyway, so how is it to be a wife? I don't think marriage is close to my lifeline right now, but I can't wait to go to you for advice about it all. So what is new in life? What do you do with your days? You ever watch South Park? Because you should. But other than that, detail me about the married life. Gimme some perspective into it. I'm so curious. I truly am. I'm a sucker for details. Ha. So yeah let's switch life stories... I would love to hear what's going on with you and everything that's even running through your mind. Treat me as your own journal..... Well, let's see.. me. Ew, I always hated talking about myself. But I guess here it goes, I've currently been mind fluctuating with what direction I want my life to go and been involved in an on and off again relationship. Where do I start?? Alright... mmm I've attended UNLV for the last two semesters and after a year after high school, I still feel like nothing has been done. I don't know what i'm even go to school for. I hate Vegas because i hate the weather and I'm grumpy in the heat. Right now, I'm grumpy. But there's so many things that tell me I should stay here, but something bigger tells me that I've always been the type that felt the need to venture what else is out there, or I will always wonder if I don't. So I have been deciding off and on again if I was going to transfer schools and move to Utah all by myself... I was for sure going in September... then changed my mind to January. Now I am doing last minute planning (something I would do) to move by the end of August. I just woke up one day and realized.. I need to get out now. So I am currently wokring on that and I am running out of time. I think I;ll be attending Weber State University and still prospecting to major in Criminal Justice. What the hell am&nbsp;I going to do with that? I don't know, but whatever I'm just depending on my book I am writing right now called Trees, yet it will have nothing to do with it.</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://www.ogdencity.com/images/Residents/weber%20state%20universityweb.jpg""><BR>That's where, as of right now, I will be attending. Who knows with me, things are always changing. I wish for some stability but hey I'm onl 19, things are always freakin changing. I just hate change when I'm already comfortable. but I guess live for the moments. <BR><IMG style=""WIDTH: 362px; HEIGHT: 190px"" height=297 src=""http://www.hellosaltlakecity.com/SaltLakeCity/images/Salt%20Lake%20City%20c1925.jpg"" width=367><BR>This is where I will be moving to. Just a 45 minute drive from school. I would live where my school is, but I find the metropolitan type of city irrisistable. Don't you? I'm sure you have more of a city in Settle than here in Vegas. I just find Vegas dirty and gross. All of it isn't really to me. Where the only places we have big buildings is the strip and the people who walk among that place are tourists. I have a sweet tooth for tall buildings. Maybe cause I long for something I don't have. I would love to be where you are. I plan to one day move to Seattle once I kind of see where my life is directing to.Are you planning to stay in Washington? Or do you think you will one day move outta there. Where do you realy want to settle one day with Eric? I wish I could fast forward in ten years just to see. I wish someone told me how sporadic life can be. Maybe it's not life, it's the people. Whatever. I talk too much, don't I? I wonder if I am boring you to death. I am sorry if I am. You should show me a bunch of pictures of your life. I want to see everything!!! I am a visual person. Haha. I miss you so much though I really do. I think this entry is already too long and I should cut it short, but there's so much still to say. Bleh....So yeah... <BR><IMG style=""WIDTH: 191px; HEIGHT: 205px"" height=288 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v600/she_is_glamour/kisss.jpg"" width=217><IMG style=""WIDTH: 138px; HEIGHT: 206px"" height=399 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v600/she_is_glamour/DSC00035.jpg"" width=258><IMG style=""WIDTH: 176px; HEIGHT: 206px"" height=410 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v600/she_is_glamour/pol.jpg"" width=339><BR>Isn't he the cutest thing alive? gah, I'm still as in love as day one. But we're going through so many changes in our lives to realize that we're way too young to be so serious right now. It really sucks lately. Like, how he might go on his mission and leave me for two years... and how we're both moving away to different places and everything. It's been kind of tough on us although the only thing keeping us together is our love for each other. But damn, he really did get comfortable with me. I've never been so dedicate to one perosn in my life that he has so much control it drives me nuts. Dude, this relationship itself has made me a crazy little asian. I hate it and love it all at the same time. It's so frustrating and confusing but yet, I feel like its always worth it and fight for things I want. Dammit, why can't things be simple. We took a break awhile ago but never had the guts to really do it. We were stilll as much as a boyfriend/girlfriend would be. Even til this day. So we'er kind of this weird never ending cycle of repitition. All in all in a mont and a half everything will really change, because we're taking different roads to places. I don't know I can't predict. I should stop talking about this though now bc this is a topic I can drag on for hours and hours. Maybe bc he's my main thang haha.<BR><BR>So yeah, I don't know what else to say because I still have so much to say but I just don't know if I am sounding too self absorbed cause its all about me. But I hope you know I want you to do the same exactly. I want to hear everything even if takes years and years to write. haha. I want a book gosh darnit. Well, I've been handling the me and Chase thing pretty good and times are tough. But I constantly surround myself with my good friends all the time. I was on TRL for a straight week in the beginning of june haha. I still hang out with Melissa and Jessica a lot a lot, and I want to take advantage of it before I leave too. I actually hang out with alot of our old HS friends since theyre been back from College. haha. Nothing too much has changed. My sister like yours, is getting so pretty. I can tell Kizna is going to prosper. She is so independent, unlike me. I think that's why I'm in a rush to get out so I can learn for myself to stop relying on everyone. Ooh. The sound of freedom sounds kind of good right now. <BR><BR><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v600/she_is_glamour/Copy-of-DSC00043.jpg""><IMG style=""WIDTH: 210px; HEIGHT: 152px"" height=471 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v600/she_is_glamour/plokkker.jpg"" width=210><IMG style=""WIDTH: 201px; HEIGHT: 154px"" height=380 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v600/she_is_glamour/ddd.jpg"" width=201><BR>PS.

Eric and I are doing really good and we are finally settled in now. Drama has been going on here in texas though. Jasons in jail.. he's being stealing stuff around the city and it finally caught up to him. My parents turned him in once they knew for sure what he was doing and had proof..

Never a dull moment in our family I tell ya. lol.. Other than that there hasnt really been anything new with me. Got a  new car, new apartment, we are doing good with money now and I like shopping too much lol..

"event","Eri!! I just tried to call you! ahh I'm going to be really really really really sad if you can't go to my wedding. Seriously when the lady told me that that was the only time they had, I was thinking about you the whole time, and I was just like Ok we'll take it. All sad and stuff. I really hope you find someway to either get off early or have someone cover your shift.. or call in! lol. I wouldnt make you do that, but I reallllllllllly want you to go. You don't even know. You have to go. I will go crazy. You scared the shit out of me when you told me the love of your life broke up with you. I was like WHAT? lol..then I realized you were kidding. I know how you feel about wanting it back to the first month. It always changes around the third or forth month like I told you before. That's just how it is. And you just gotta learn how to cope. I promise you he doesn't love you any less than that first month tho! And, when it seems like he takes you for granted, hes just being a normal human like we all get when we know that the person we are taking for granted, arent going to go away. At least thats what we think. And we all do it. And it sucks. And I wish it wasnt like that, but it is. :( We all take the most important people in our lives for granted, and until they are gone, we don't realize it. He loves you just as much as the first day he met you, even more, and when he acts robotic, its just him realizing that you are going to stick by him forever. Or until you get sick of him. lol. Jk. Just normal relationship stuff. I'm soooo happy for you on your 6th month anniversary tho! That is freakin awesome! This is probably your most serious relationship huh? Now that we are outta highschool and have matured, well kinda. lol. I'm really happy for you tho. I'm so glad that you found someone who is truly good to you, because if he wasn't..I'd kill him. You were hilarious on the phone. I really hope you get to make my wedding. I'll die. Really, you HAVE to be there. I'm not kidding. I know mel gets off at 1:30, so she shouldn't have a problem. But if you can somehow get off with her, or someone covers for you and you two can make it together, that would be awesome. Because I <b>neeeed</b> you there. Well I really have a ton to do today, and you need to call me and we'll have to figure out something we can do to get you to my wedding. I'm sorry this is a problem. Argh! I wish it wasnt booked. I wonder why the hell it is. That annoys me. I love you. Write me back, call me, talk to me, jeremy me. Bye."

<P>I feel like jumping off a building. That is exactly what I feel like doing. I got the worst news today. I'm not going to make it to my best friend's wedding. And also the love of my life broke up with me. Now today is officially the worst day of my life. Well, those are two factors that would make my life super suck. But only one is true.&nbsp;I don't know what to do!?!? I can't believe I won't be able to make your first wedding. I don't know what to do. When I got the news I wanted to cry. I want to cry now. I should cry now. I am crying now. Dammit. I am sooooo devastated. I'm sooooo devastated! You know how energetic and hyper I was last night. Well, I am polar opposite. I don't know what to do!?!? Well, in just a couple days you'll be here and we can figure this out. I'm your best friend! I neeeeeeeeeed to be there?!?! I'm a terrible friend. I feel like a terrible person. I feel terrible PERIOD! Ugh. UGH. uggggggggggh!!!! I seriously feel like I can kill small school children right now or anything relatively close to that...&nbsp; What the effffffff!?! I am going to see what I can do. I will try everything. I promise. I will try my very hardest. PINKY promise. For the sake of all the kid's in Newton....<BR>Do you remember Mr. Pyne? He past away when we were in 7th grade. Morgan Holland was devastated.<BR>I don't know what to do?! I know that you are spending Thanksgiving with The Sakuma's but if you have room in your belly you are invited to my family thanksgiving. So if you want there is an extra seat just for you. .. <BR>So, this officially has been a crazy day. Well, Chase had a show tonight. And I wasn't able to go! Boo me! I suck as a girlfriend and a best friend. I always have work on important days. I ended up falling asleep after talking to you on the phone last night and didn't do make take home test that I did all morning and showed up 30 minutes late to class today. After, a good day at work ( and yes, it was actually a good day) I went to in n out and watched family guy with Melissa. Now I am writing to you before Chase calls me. I am going there after work tomorrow. I know I shouldn't be going there because I have a ton of things to do, but I feel like I really want and need to. I can't progress correctly without seeing him becasue I miss him like crazy all the time. And second, we are celebrating our 6th month anniverary tomorrow too. I can't wait. He is so amazing....<BR>My night has now ended at the worst now though. I can't go to your wedding! Until that changes..my mood has now officially gone done for the weekend. And jsut to top off that I am PMSing big time. I feel bad because I totally blew up on Chase.</P>
<P>Heyy... I just got off the phone with Chase. And I don't feel so good. I miss how everything was in the beginning it was just a month ago when everything was perfect and now I feel like sometimes he takes me for granted. Whatever. I don't want to even talk about this. I don't know why I get so emotional. He's like a robot sometimes. Uhhh. Whatever, Anywase, the important is your wedding. I'll talk to you soon. Wb here asap. &lt;3 I love you so much. Last night made my night alking to you on the phone. I am so sorry for being so crazy. haha. Well, I hope to talk to you soon. and 3-4 more days I get to see you! yayyy&lt;3</P>

 You know what's funny?.. Typing in our password. lol. It makes me laugh. Well anyway. I'm soooo sorry I missed your call yesterday! I was out allll day and I wanted to call you when I got home, but it was really late and didnt want to call your house and bother anyone. Even tho now I remember you are insomniac and that your mom is probably still out of town. I'm stupid. But I was dead tired and I know we can talk for hours. That little boy and big brother story.. OMG. I know what you mean when your heart is going to pop out of your chest because that happens to me ALL the time if I almost get in a wreck! Ahh.. Thank God that you both swerved. Somebody is looking out for you, and them.. because they would have been the ones who got hurt. That's scary tho! Yay.. I'm so glad you got the 23rd off because I want to spend a day with you!! Eri you can wear whatever you want to the wedding! Don't matta. I want Mel and Jess to come too. I really hope Eric is fine with doing it on the 27th because that's what I've told everyone and people took work off for it, so I'm hoping that's ok. lol. I'm sure he won't mind. I hope. We are going to be running around like crazy chickens trying to figure out everything, but I know everything is going to work out good. No, I can't sleep! I'm like dead tired at night and I'll go try and go to sleep and I just lay there and think of everything and can't sleep. That one night I talked to Kathy and she was lecturing me was really the worst night. I layed there for like 4 hours not being able to sleep. But I calmed myself down after that night and now I just think to myself, it's going to be fine.. I'll show you my dress when we hang out on the 23rd! I'm going to be staying at Steph's.. so you can come over and look at it, then we can go hang out and do whatever crazy girls like us do. hehe. It's ok about Ryan Cabrera! I read it on your myspace and it's ok.. lol. I love that man tho. His new song is awesome! :) Well I think I picked out my chapel. I'm just scared to reserve it because I haven't talked to eric. But.. I'm not scared because those chapels are opened all day and I'm sure we can get squeezed in sometime during the 27th. So no worries. I'll probably have to book it like RIGHT before I leave for vegas. Cus I'm gonna wait till I get a letter from him, and I'll probably get one wed, or thurs if he writes back right away like I told him to. So hopefully that's the case. I'm going to go and spend Thanksgiving with Eric for sure. I wouldnt want him to have to handle that by himself. If kathy did put us through that. Which I really hope she doesnt. But she hasnt mentioned the wedding to me anymore, and I havent either. So she's probably just waiting to yell at both of us when we get home. Oh well.. It will be ok. When she sees how involved and supportive everyone else is, hopefully she'll be more used to it. Jamie and Wades mom's are throwing the reception now, so we'll see how that goes. It's really turning out to be a wedding. Not just like some cheap drive thru vegas thing. Which is cool, I just wish my parents could be there to see it. That's the whole point of a renewal ceremony tho, which we will have one. I'm not missing out on everything I've always wanted. But this one will still be perfect. So anyway, enough about that.. It stresses me out.lol. How is school and work going?? Have you seen chase lately? Are you getting good grades? and what classes are you taking? cuz I dont know that! I wanna know.. so fill me in! I gots to go tho hun.. Dinner time. I love you!! Write me back or Davy is going to break up with you"

I am so sorry that I took forever to write in this back. I actually started a couple times but then I never liked what I wrote. haha. I can be the most annoying perfectionist at times. But anyway, I called you yesterday and I think I left a message. I can't remember but I know that your voicemail sounds like a feminine Justin Timberlake. You sound cute. I miss that voice of yours. I know I just talked to you on the phone and all but I am more looking forward to seeing you in person. I took the 23rd of at work and I am free all day. If you need me to pick you up the airport or wherever you are. I am willing to. So you and I have to hang out that day. I'll treat you. I miss you so much. So please take that day aside for me. I also took of the 27th. I still have to work in the morning but I will be there at your big day. I am so excited. I can't wait to see your dress. I am way excited to see it. I am way excited to see you. Tomorrow, then it will be 7 days until you are here back home. I am glad things are sounding a little better with Kathy. I know it's tough, but hey you have to go to that dinner and stick by Eric 100%. She sounds really intimdating. So, has she compromised yet? Is she going to the wedding? Your hearts and minds are set on this wedding. Whether or not she comes, it's not going to change things. So why doesn't she make the best of ita nd go to her son's first and only wedding he will have in his life. That is my opinion. I am excited. So what dress should I get? I don't know what I should wear!? Maybe you can help me out when you're here. Well, I miss you face a whole lot. I hope you like the pictures I took for you. Haha. I am lame, I know. And I am such a photowhore. Eh. Oh no, and I have bad news about Ryan Cabrera. He is playing this Wednesday on the 17th and not on the 23rd. I lied and I am sorry. My mistake. Don't worry though, we'll do something better. But anyway, so are you stressed with all these things happening to you in just a couple weeks. Can you even sleep at night? I mean I know I couldn't if I had all these things on my plate. Shoot, I can't sleep now and my stuff isn't that crazy. JUst term patpers and work all the time. It's non-stop. I can't get a hold of myself sometimes. But yeah, how is Eric? I miss that Sakuma too. MHM. So, anyway. My life. It's simple. I go to work. I go to school. The end. It's repetitive..it makes me crazy. I have Chase which keeps me sane. ANd Melissa helps me go through my day because she seems to always make me feel better after the worst day. Yesterday, I almost killed a boy. I was crying right after too. Alright, so this is waht happened. I was driving out of the drive way and sped up quickly out of there. This non-chalant 13 yera old boy and his 4 year old brother sitting on his lap drives towards me in their little motor bike. At the most I was just going 25 mph and he was going pretty fact too. He came from a blind corner and went head on to my lane. He and his little brother were like inches from death. I wish I was exaggerating, but it was soo scary. We both swerved in time, as if it was some game of chicken because we both were in shock and almost had no reaction to this whole situation. The screech on my breaks shrilled the whole neighborhood later on my sister informend she even heard the noise from upstairs her bedroom. I smelt the rubber from my tires even when I arrived work. It was bad. So, after the whole thing I was holding my chest hoping that my heart won't pop out because it was beating so fast. The two boys backed up and I rolled my window down. He looks terrified and very sorry. He kept kissing his little brother on the head and saying ""IM SO SORRY IM SOO SORRY>"" and then kissing the little boy in the head. The 4 year old boy was so naive and was smiling and he was so adorable. I wasn't even mad just concerned. And for the first time I felt like a mother there. It just felt that I really cared for them. All I said was, "" You guys have to be safe and look where you guys are going....slow down.....be safe...etc etc..."" and the older brother just kept apologizing. I feel bad..he knows it was his fault and he knows he put his little borther and him in danger. I drove off and told them to be safe. And the young little toddler in his cute little voice was like ""You drive safe too."" and waved. It was so adorable. I started crying when I pictured the situation to go a different direction.... What if my brakes suck? And what if we both didn't swerve at the right time? what would've happened? That was what happened in my day yesterday...well, that and I watched a whole season of Mr. Bean and it reminded me of you. I know this is long and probably boring. I hope you like those pictures in the previous entry. I love you and I can't wait to see you soon. Wedding countdown!!!!

 Hi Jubie.. I got a dress!! Yay!! It's realllly pretty. It's one sleeved, know what I mean?, and it has diamonds alll over it, and it has a little train in the back, and its tight fitting. It's really pretty. I'm really excited! And I got a letter from Eric yesterday and he told me that he feels exactly like I do, and he is not going to let his mom stop us from this. :) So I'm not scared of her anymore. I'm excited. I know everything is going to work out awesome. So YAY! Where have you been shaggy? I havent heard anything new.. :(. I talked to Erics mom again today and she just IMed me all nice and was asking me to have thanksgiving with them and everything. So I told her I would love to. But I'm scared. I think she has an evil plot behind all of this. Like what if she announces it at the dinner and makes us explain ourselves and stuff. Urgh that would suck. Maybe I should back out of going. But, I don't want eric to be pressured. I dunno. We'll see what happens. I'm going to book a chapel before then so.. screw her. lol. Well I'm coming soon erikita! And I am excited. We are hanging out k. Well.. WRITE ME BACK! Love ya!"

   Hi Jubie.. How are you doing. Well Erics mom is still not supporting us but after I talked to her I think she understood more about why we are doing this. She still doesnt think weve thought this through enough and thingks we're too young or something. But whatever. She'll see when it happens we are serious and nothing is going to stop us. So yes you are right. whats meant to be will happen, and if he wants this as much as I do nothing will stop us. So I found a BEAUTIFUL dress. omg I love it. but its 270 dollars. I wasnt planning on spending that much on this little ceremony, but this is our real wedding, i think i need a nice dress for it. It's tight fitting, has diamonds all over it, and has a slit in the front and the bottom of it is sooo pretty. its gorgeous, i love it. Im so freaking excited. Im not nervous at all.. just stressed out because of erics mom. but ive been telling myself not to be. so i cried everything out last night and i feel better. So anyways. i am dead tired from running around all day and then i have to go get ready to go to grahams here soon. have i told you about grahams? its the club we go to every thursday. thats where weve met all of our friends at. lol. thursday is college night. ive probably already wrote about this. but ya know.. its ok. jeremy stoker. lol. i wonder what is up with that pretty man. hes cute. i love him. lol. i hope you have fun watching the oc tonight!! i guess i need to get hooked like everyone else is. but i havent even watched an episode. the previews dont look as good as everyone makes it out to be. the main girl looks like she sucks at acting. lol.. she annoys me in the previews. but, ill have to check out an episode sometime and see how it is. i cant tonight unfortunately because jenny is obsessed with grahams. lol. oh well..something to do. eri, lets hang out on the 23rd. do you work?.. let me know. cuz thats the day before eric gets home and charlene has school and work and steph does too probably, and i wanna hang out with you! so let me know if you are freeee.. lol. well you better write me about everything thats going on in your life in the next entry, and tell me how your little gathering with your oc friends went! k.. love you!! but shaggy. you like shaggy, and his psycho friend! lol..byye!

<P>Uhh. Isn't it weird when the adults start acting more like children than their children? Yeah, Kathy needs to understand that this is what you want to do. This both you and Eri'cs decision. In time, she will give you her support, but it will take time. Maybe it's hard for to let go&nbsp;of Eric or something. I know you want so bad her okay in things, and not everything can be perfect or the way you want it. But everything will work out. Everything happens for its reasons, and it will fine. The things that are suppose to happen will happen whether or not she does support or not. You know you love him and he loves you. Kathy understands that, but she's not in your position so it's harder for her to see. You just have to keep proving to her that you both are ready and even if you don't get her approval before the wedding then that is her loss for missing her son's wedding. But even after that, you two have to prove to her that you guys did make the right decision, so even if not now, but in later times..she will finally give her regards to both of you. Feel really blessed that you have parents that gave their blessings to you. I love your parents. They're like mine too. Two amazing people....Geehz, how much I miss coming to your house and listening to your dad sing and your mom give me that smile...I miss that so much. Please tell them hi for me? I would really appreciate it. So anyway, I hope you find that perfect dress in time. I know you will. No matter what dress you find, you would look beyond amazing. I got this new Mac eyeliner you can use on your wedding day. It works amazing, haha. I'm sure you'll have your own eyeliner but still. And since Jamie and Wade are planning your reception party..Can I have the pleasure of planning your bachlorette party? I promise it will be worth it. Mhhhm. I'm already pouring with ideas. I'll invite all of the girls you want me to. So have you talked to your mom about me walking with her walking you down the aisle. Actually, I don't know if you'll want that... If I have to give you away, I just might never let go. Or have a really tight grip on your arm and you'd have to struggle from my grasp. I never thought it would be this soon to see you get married. What...<EM>Julie is getting married?</EM> What....<EM>Julie's wedding day is on the 27th?</EM> Saying this aloud all feels like some crazy illusion, but some how it is so surreal. I am way happy for you. I know you and Eric will be happy. And I know that Davey still asks about me. These are facts known to all. This is quite a long entry huh? I've always been a writer..I'm sorry if I bore you. I just hope that all will go well. I'm counting down the days until you are here. And I am really looking forward to spending some time together before you are Mrs. Eric Sakuma. Weird that I am going to be Mrs. Eri Sakuma. Hmm. Sounds good. I love you both. I love youuuu. So how are you feeling, my new bride? I can't wait to see how you look.&nbsp;I can't wait at all. Here's some dresses I found..Maybe you'll like some of them?

You wanted me to tell you my thoughts,day, yada yada, so here I am. lol. Kathy (erics mom) just IMed me and was like ""We need to talk, are you going to be on in about an hour?"" and I told her I'd get on.. and she said Ok talk to ya then. And I said is something wrong?.. and she was like ""hmm...can we talk later"" and i was like alright.. So urgh!! She found out that I'm planning the wedding I think and I think she's really mad. But whatever, I'm over it.. I'm gonna see what she says and just tell her ""I totally understand that you don't want us to, but this is what we want, we are ready, and we are going to do it. So you can either support us or not. but we'd really love your support"" So.. we'll see. We are adults. This is our decision to make. get over it!.. lol.. So we'll see. On another note. I went shopping for dresses today. Didn't find any. Waco sucks ass. So.. I'm going to austin friday and we'll see what they have. I'm so excited, but when Kathy comes in to mind I just get all frustrated. argh. lol. It will be OK tho. Everything will be fine I know it. Wade and Jamie want to pay for the whole reception. I guess they are gonna plan it and everything and I was just like ok..whoa. lol Like that was really nice of them. I hope they dont go overboard. Well Eri lynn I told you my thoughts, its your turn! Tell me about your day, your life, your frustrations. I wanna hear. lol. Your post is hilarious. So many wonderful memories that just make me smile, and frickin crack up!!

"event","<P>It's funny how we always have some device to keep us together. In high school it was a notebook or notes, then it turned through email and the internet. To now having, our personal Livejournal that keeps a scrapbook of letters. Anything to keep in touch with you. I am glad. &lt;3</P>
<P>Texas, <BR>It was nice to talk to you tonight. Even if I haven't talked to you in awhile. I can always depend on you for awkward silences and boring conversations.&nbsp;&lt;3 No, you know that is quite just the polar opposite. It's weird how we can pick up wherever we left off. That's what true friends are. And you have always been a good friend to me. I can't thank you enough for your loyalness throughout the years. And without you, I think I would've been still in 8th grade trying to pass that stupid geography test but luckily, you and I are smarter than Jordan Hafen...and coincedently&nbsp;getting the highest grades in that exam together and for some reason we sat right next to each other. I'm glad we don't have to cheat in order to be smart. It comes so natural for us. And without you, I'd probably still be waiting at the mall valet bench hoping someone will come pick me up, but I had you and luckily we got a ride home. From a nice man with a stepchild, a ruined boxing career and a weird wife. It's funny how that one specific boxer was a valet man that day. What a nice man to tell us his life and take us home. I probably would've liked it enough if he just took us home...and I don't think I should even begin with our lovely time wiht those little boys we rode with at the Logandale carnival..I love Bobby and Greg. Amazing boys , that I can never forget. But I am loosing my main track here. My point is I am glad I got to talk to you tonight and as well i am glad to be blessed with someone like you in my life from the past to the present and to the future as well. I am looking forward to future entries in this LJ of ours. I want you to tell me everything, because I am very interested...down to the littlest thing. I want to know. I want to be there for you and need ou to know I am lawyas here to listen. Your life is my business. I feed of your thoughts....It's kind of late...And I've got a full day ahead of me. I hope to talk to you soon. And more than anything, I want to congratualte you on your wedding. I am very happy for you. And I know I have repeated myself like some broken record player...But really, I am very excited for what the future has for you. I know it's many great things. Bye Dorothy. <BR><BR>&lt;3 VEGAS</P>

Broad, is this sea
The salt, enters the wounds
My take, on you is simple
So heal, your fear
To heal, your fear
Time, spent wading off shore
The calm, before the storm
My take, from you is simple
So heal, your fear
To heal, your fear
You're such a comfortable liar
You're such a comfortable liar
You're such a comfortable liar
You're such a comfortable liar
You're such a comfortable liar
So calm
Cause I said wrong
You comfortable liar
You comfortable liar
You comfortable liar
You comfortable liar
Liar

""Get Some""

I tried an idea for no reason
Keep the sun off our shoulders
Crawling back to

[Chorus]
A black out
Touching new life
Face down
Set the pace again

The drive the idea still existing
Sat and shuddered broke the pattern
Falling inward
In and down up and out
Let it go follow way back
Call it off any day anyway
Make you feel this
A black out
Touching new life
Face down
Set the pace again
[bridge]
Don't take the fall
We'd hate to see
That's entertainment
Get some
Eyes on the goal
Last one to get
Is passed over looked over
Never rehearse
They've spiked the water
It's in the blood
Get some
We've underestimated
How can I
Get some
How can I [x3]
Get some
[outro]
A blackout
Could this be the one

""Another Know It All""

Damn you're so dull
Still need to borrow your hate
Change what they can
Persuade us back under cover
Oh old you're so over
Who made you king of the ages
Tending the wounds
Thinking of adding another
[Chorus]
But the
Chosen never wrong
He sat holding
Several thoughts
I'll take anything
That's not bolted down
Tricking us in, don't get along if they're brothers
So phasing it out, correcting vision with fists
And drawing a line, still give it less than a week
Checking the wounds, thinking of adding another
[bridge]
Free what's bolted down"

"event","Wow u wanna talk about a bad day. First my step dad chews me out like the ass he is. Then play a awful round of golf losing at least 10 balls within the first 3 holes, then on my way to canada we get pulled in by customs then searched ( they found nothing YESSSSS) then held by Canadian Police for at least an hour because of a former Criminal record from at least 15 years ago for my uncle. then after all of this they turn us around and tell us to leave Canada, we get back to the us side and we got searched before we even made it to the customs officer they were doing random checks on the us side, then when we get to the booth she searches our car fucking gay I couldnt believe it, then after all that I took a wrong turn in detroit got lost but thanks for ware I parked for all last season for the lions games I figured out ware I was. then we stoped by Comerica to see if there was a game and of course there wasnt. so we drive the hour back home. then spend like 40 bucks to fix my headlight broken by the Customs guard. there gose that pay check. so now my uncle gets mad so go to Mt. Pleasant to go to the soaring eagle casino because obviously we couldnt go to Windsor's casino and im not old enough for detroits casinos (7 months YESSSSSSSSSSSS). after we left there got pulled over my a state trooper for no reason at all he said he detected alchahol in the car both of us sober searched my car didnt find anything had to be a dick and try to get me on other things which i dont understand. got home watched espn to see who won the indy game. Really hope we dont go to game 5 with phily i dont want to work game 5 at the palace I cant stand Iverson really wish that guy who threw a quarter wouldove thrown a rock. He wasnt in my section tho so i couldnt tell him that ha. But im out I have to work Boxing tonight at the palace. lata"

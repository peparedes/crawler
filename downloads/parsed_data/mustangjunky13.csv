"event","good morning well not really a good morning but i can not sleep and i must make account of the events that led to my inability to sleep.

1:30 restless 
i roll around unable to escape the reality of the world and slip into the mesmerizing wold of dreams i jump up in search of a stable something to help lull me out of this dreary existentce. perhaps a glass of milk and a cookie. The bright lights hurt my eyes to my dismay no milk can be found. the pantry reminds me of the cartoons where nothing is in there but cobwebs.the sound of the car starting is almost deafening at two in the morning. The blair of the music keeps me, well actually i was not sleepy so it was just good to drown out the screaching produced when singing occurs.mmm milk and a coffe doughnut nothing better in life. The sound of prrrrrrrr is alll i remember as the cat lulled me to sleep aroound 2:00

3:30 jolt

the feeling of cold sweat, an inability to breath, a cold shiver drifts across my spine, and goosbumps run across my whole body.  was it a dream or did i hear a voice

 i never have woken up like this before 

well maybe it was my computer i left it running with a cd in it berfor i went to sleep. 

no it was my uncle he called my phone around 3:45 then the home a minute later he was looking to pick up his four wheelers at 4 in the morning.
well let me start with a little history my uncle is manic depressive and has gone beyond the far end. he was kicked out of the house and soon faces a divorce but will not take his medicine to get under controle. i would not like to face him as he is.he is no longe rthe uncle i knew and loved he is dead to me. i refused to open the door for him and eventually he left. 
the one fear i have is that he had another person with hiim i did not know. i know that nobody he knew befor he went manic would be with him so it could have been some person looking to rob the home. 
this was not the beginning to a day i was hoping for.i went home knowing the only reason they did not break into the home was because i was there.
why is it a necassary rule for family to let you down. i will never trust family for anything ever again"

Robert Frost
 
Nothing Gold Can Stay

Nature's first green is gold, 
Her hardest hue to hold. 
Her early leaf's a flower; 
But only so an hour. 
Then leaf subsides to leaf. 
So Eden sank to grief, 
So dawn goes down to day. 
Nothing gold can stay. 

i like its bitter truth but i cry whenever i think about it"

enough of a place were good people suffer and die

enough of a place were the bad people prosper 

enough of a place that seperates the weak from the strong

enough of a place were people starve to death when there are people you own billions

enough of a world were real men are scoffed upon and men who model underwear are sought after. 

enough of a world were one man considers hard work as a day at a desk.

enough of a world where men like firemen and policemen and teachers make enough to scrape by while video game programers make millions.

enough of a world based upon what is seen in reality television.

enough of a place that glamourizes stupidity like jack ass and viva la bam

enough of a place that moves from fad to fad or however it is said.

enough of a world were skinny and orange are terms used in reference to beauty rather than pencils.

enough of a place where religeons condem eachother to hell with out realization that the person they condem could be there best friend

enough of a world where people can overspend to look more high class than they really are

enough of a world where cancer can kill unbiased and with no sort of warning

enough of a world where disease is spread knowingly 

enough of a worl where crack whores can get preagnant and ruin several children while good people are unable to birth a child. 

enough of a world where kids must live in filth or even not be able to afford shoes

enough of a world where kids under 16 have cell phones or worse find it sexy to wear a thong

enough of a life used struggling to fit in or be a part of a group

   I lke school right now it is just so fast i mean i am supposed to have like three papers and two tests done next week you would ythink they would be spread out but no they are all right next to each other like they planned it that way to see how we work under pressure and it is not like i can get started now we have to do all this in class or on the internet between a certain time period.that sucks i got two internet tests due by the same time and one is timed.this is fucking ridiculous. 
   ok back to my first thought i can not believe i let the world slip from me i am a complete out cast as it goes i mean i did not even get emails telling me to keep writing so i guess not many cared i was gone. well let me tell what i am up to i am in school of course i am working doiing american Eagle, Babysitting, and working at a car garage now helping with cars and answering phones. it is cool i suppose but i just seem to have so much going on at one time but i need the money to pay for the massive debts i have racking up well that is mostly it so i think i will go for now but i will be back later tonight."

"event","Dear journal,

     ok well guidlines do not decide to wait till the last minute to see an advisor about your next semester classes like they force you to d at cbu i was unable to talk about my classes till this week that sucks everyone else i know said oh well i got to take this and that lalala and i was like i have not eve n talked about it yet. well i am supposed to go talk about it today at 10:30 so i will be able to tell what i got to take next semester. 

     also it is like 500 dollars to breech contract so i can lkive at home and not pay so much to live at the dorm it is cheaper to pay the cost but damn five hundred dollars to breech i can see like fifty bucks a little sting maybe but five hundred damn. thta hurts me deep in the hole of my pocket. i hate being poor so today after class i am going to starbucks and video movies and more to get a job a needed job with christmas coming up and all. 

     i have never had a prolem getting a job befor i show up i interview then bam i am handed a uniform amd i got the job. i have done this like five times no problem plus i got good references at most of the places i worked at it should not be hard to get a job. the only problem is i might end up liking coffee if i work at starbucks plus everybody will like kill me on the i want coffee bring me coffee lalala. 

     ok if nobody has noticed my new thing is lalala because i like to think of people saying that when they annoy me. seriously i visualize them saying that and do not hear what they really say i have a strong ability to tune people out it is very easy i can not explain it i just can do it. i really thin everyone should try it and perfect it if possible.the only prblem is it can not be taught it must be in the genes cause oh man can my mom do it i have seen her in acdtion and damn she can block out a train wreck.

      i wish i had a little clock thing that slowed down time so i could like finish thing faster and not have to worry about all the things i worry about. it is not a big deal i just have alot on my plate and i have a small stomach nice metaphor huh well i thought it was. but see i can stuff myself and finish it all cause i know i have to and so far i have been doing alright nothing to complain about but i thank sara and all my freinds for that even jason and johnathon for the relaxing weekend at the utk football game which was fucking awesome all i got to say is nazi rainbow cow yep and we beat alabama. 

well i got things to do an advisor to see and such so i will return to tell what i got to take next semester after my almost month and a half break for christmas

goodbye journal."

<P>&nbsp; ok well today has been alright so far i have had the normal everyday school stuff no test or anything i got my normal nap inbetween my 9:00 and 2:00 class i always enjoy. however i would like to state again that english class sucks hairy nut sack and shoukd be taught by un stupid people that teach not baby and badly grade papers. i think she got her degree in teaching at like a day care about thirty million years ago. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src=""http://www.streetcredart.com/paintings/screaming.giraff.with.statue.large.jpg""></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>well now that i got that out what about last night man did it pour it literally threw my door open scared the shit out of me and i think lightning hit right outside my house not to mention the down pour it was litterally raining buckets upon buckets yikes. i am normally cool in storms but i was like damn lets build a fucking arc in this mother fucker pooky. with some secret ingredient or something i mean damn. my dogs were freaked out it was crazy talk. well it really was not that bad it was loud and very heavy rain thunder lightning and such but really it would have been cool to go out into it and just twirl it was like jim carry and the malco rain or was that the cable guy or was it the truman show well one of those movies he twirled in the rain and it was cool i might do that tonight it is supposed to rain hard tonight too.</P>
<P>oh the title nap is just cause i want one but i can not i got a meeting to go to at 4 and i can not go to sleep right now which sucks ass but atlest i went to vote bush bush is all i want hehe. get it ""bush"" anyway i voted for bush only cause i hate kerry not that i like bush he is a dushbag of all dushbags but kerry is just really scary bush pales in comparison of stupidity to kerry really he does sorry kerry fans. but back to the real problem i want a nap a good two hour power nap to just get the sleepin moving then i want to go running or work out something. </P>
<P>i got so bored in english class i drew a huge ass dove with a crown of thorns and tears on my forearm and a maltice cross on my hand not too bad if i say so myself but i do not think tatto artist is in my near future unless i can use a connect the dots or color in the lines type of proccess and i think they do but they have to sketch the desighn first so i would need a helper. well that was just way off and random conversation with myself. anywho i am loving the cool temp lately i mean it really kicks ass pluss i get to wear my winter wear oh yeah baby sweaters jackets and more oh my. the only problem is i wear these things with shorts and people are like why long sleavs short pant not the bright thing to do my freind. then i am like why not my legs are warm my top is cold so get off my back ass face well not so much the get off back and ass face part but the top cold bottom warm thing very much so.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; ok well today is the day i mean i get down to business on my scrapbook and fixing up my bird house that is right my bird house my chiurch is gonna raise money by selling birdhouses made by famous people and artists and people like me so i think i might have my plan make it in to an old general store yep or put photos of like old thing on it or both i am not too sure but i got it all ready i am feeling artsy today and i will work in the world of glue tape and wood. well atleast i will try not sure how good i will do but i can hope can i not and hope i will do.</P>
<P>why is it so hard to live i mean i do all i ca to make life easier and yet it smacks me down like a wet mut it i think there is not enough time in the day not becaus there is not enough time but as a sick joke to fuck with people and make them rush around and not finish so they feel bad about it and got to do the same thing in the morning time is really just a way to keep the man down well i say fuck the man and time well i am not so much for fucking a man but time yeah. i say we make enough time in a day i mean why not a bunch of drunk ass people made time up anyway so why not change it to make it what we want hell i think i am gonna make my birdhouse a clock oh yeah a clock that has enough time in the day where we have 15&nbsp; hours on the clock thirty hours a day. </P>
<P>well we could try that but really i am too lazy to do it and what for i like not finishing what i have to do in the day i already got.</P>
<P>well i am tired and want to go plus i got a meeting&nbsp;so be back later&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bye journal.&nbsp;</P>"

   well i had a vision today, i was in the middle of the day, then i got called it was a freind telling me about a thing at school. they had a car smashing go on at school a quarter for every swing with the sledgehammer it was like a dream come true i maen i have done it before at a highschool as a reminder for the prom promise but this was perfect. i have been feeling controlled squashed and this was like  a fresh breahtof air. oh momma. each wack with the hammer was like a brick being lifted off me. it was wondrfull oh baby. i smashed a window ripped a door off and busted the radiator.it was the greatest thing of all time especially since i do not have my car yet and i got to destroy someone elses. it was like heaven.i just seem to be lost in everythingbut i am just really glad that i made great grades at mid-term well atleast so far i got the western civilization exam tomorrow. yikes well i am not to bothered by it i think i could handle it no problem since the main part is an essay.i really like that i am good at essays especially ones about history. well i just like to learn history. it is interesting and you can learn alot about it like what we are and where we came from. well i just a not too worried about it but i need to study. i do have all morning tomorrow morning so it is all good. well i suppose i could stop boring you about my school stuff.

i am gonna have the best weekend. i am gonna have an oktoberfest full weekend then see sara alot and drink alot and have a relaxing weekend i just hope everyhting goes well for the whole oktoberfest we really need to make money this year. well i am actually writing this at the fest since i am hacking in on someones internet. well i think i should go well i will be back later.

   well i have had a most awfull week of all time and it is only wed. i mean well it could be alright if this weekend is alright. plus i get al next week off haha. anyway first sara left to go to boston i am happy she went but i really miss her not that i would have had much time to see her anyway but maybe i could have made time. then it is fucking mid-term week and it sucks ass the easy tests are over not that any will be too hard but i mean this sucks ass cause they give like only one test for each like mid semester then a final no like little quizes or such but two fucking tests yes two fucking tests per semester that really blows. i mean a couple of my classes have minny test everyonce in awhile but two only have the two test that make up like fifty percent of my grade damnit.

   not to mention the fact that it has not been sunny in like four or five days i feel like shit and it is cold. i have to drive the shitty ass truck i got so i could get around since the stupid fucks i let work on my car are taking forever to do something simple as hell it is pissing me the fuck off the damn fuck off. i just do not understand how people can be so fucking retarded. oh for the love of god i just talked to these people and guess what the women that owned the place and ran it died on saturday. how and the hell can this happen to me i eman really i am sorry may sound heartless but she could have waited till later i mean damn.

   ok well it is not all bad i mean i am in good health i got all week next week off sara gets home todayi got the oktoberfest and friends to see this weekend i will survive i suppose.


   but for real i wish some people would tell me if they liked my dummy site if i have not shown it to them"

    Excuse me on my last entry i was a little bored and had things on my mind so i decided to have a little fun and be a little weird. I like to step out of the norm and be a little original or creative. anyone have like a million things running through at one time and wish you could just write them all down right there or put a pic down of it in a book. you know i think i might just start to do that i saw a guy in one of my classes that has a like three four hundred page book leather bound that has notes songs photos sketches. he had sketches in marker pencil those coal pencils and very cool cuttings from papers and magazines. i want something like that to be able to recall my thoughts and ideas of the day better. hey maybe even give it to my kids so they can see how twisted and weird i was when i was younger. my kids will have nothing on me i know it. well maybe a little since i will give them alot of weirdness, but maybe they will turn out like sara and i will not worry about them. that would be really great.

   I mean really she is the better of us and i think that is good cause she keeps me in line especially in college. i might go loose on fall holiday though i am talking full on party oh yeah. i could do it at heathers party with jason and johnathon so sara can take care of me. I mean I have not let loose in awhile. It is not like really go crazy and get so drunk I can not pee straight but i like to be a little loose. i still hope my kids take after sara rather than me maybe they would not gain my fathers genes.i do not think the world would loose much to be rid of the odd behaviors of my dad.really it would not be at a loss if it lost many of mine i almost beg that i do not pass on many habits to my kids.

   somehow i find myself lost in it all the thought of college leaving so many years so much history behind to now believing i am deciding my life. i mean in high school life was the football games the parties. life in elementary school was the next meal the next disney movie, hell the next school project or science fair.but i have stepped upon the next plateau into the thought of life as what job i want who i am going to marry where i am going to live. i know it may sound too soon to think about it but it is staring me in the face i know who i am going to marry what job i want well supposedly what i want to do it may change. i do not know where i will live but that will come.i do not want to say i have a planned out life but i feel like it has just fallen into my lap.

   Think about all we have done in our lives so far i mean really we survived high school we survived friends and love. we survived learning to finger paint and drive. we learned our abc's and that there are something like 32 flavors of jello shots.we got cell phones and moved from video cassette to dvd. we replaced the floppy disk with cd-rw and speed up the internet with cable instead of dial up. we saw comic books become full length films we fucking saw a historical event, that ranked up there with kennedy being shot, on 9-11. we learned what is cool and what is not not we saw the fucking new millennium. we have seen corruption in the oval office and the dawn of the damn reality TV escapade to hit the nation. we all fell into the world of free music with the mp3 programs.we figured out who we wanted to be and who we wanted to hang out with. 

   Now just think we are not even a third of the way through this horrible existence we call life. think of all the things we will see in the 80 to 100 year lives we have on this planet.the only truly great thing is that no matter what we do or see in this life it will never compare to what comes next. that is what i look forward to and always will. i do not understand why so many people hate the life they are given i mean really it is a gift just take it and run get all you can see everything you can live every moment do not let anyone or anything stand in your way or shut you in and smother you. well i just wanted to ramble a bit hope you do not mind i will see you tomorrow 

thank you for listening

    i am orry i have ignored you lately i hope you were not to lonely. i have just been busy plus writing every day leaves not very fun stories and boring entries.to tell you the truth i am not really having an exciting time i am just getting along day by day happy with what i have. i kind of wish there was more more excitement in my life it all kind of feels like a routine. well i guess i will ge tto be free during fall greak summer break christmas break. maybe it is just school i think i might write and send a video to the road rules and real world and see if they take me it would be fun i might not be pretty enought though i mean not many normal people get on the show anymore. hey but they do need a good clean catholic they always have one on every season it is like a given that might work for me.

     i do not know am i alone does everything seem kind of sluggish and set in pattern.i mean baseball practice does and school does but that is given they are supposed to but is everything supposed to feel that way.

     i did break pattern this year i did not go to the fair but once and it was only for a short while i normally go twice for the whole day. once for food. then once for the rides. bu i did not go but once i got some great food and had fun while i was there but i missed the two days.
but you know it will be fine i got next year and the next year. no worries.

     i have been working on a project lately a birdhouse for my church each year we have a bird house bash to raise money people dress up bird houses and we auction them off. i am thinking of do a collage of pics of things to make them look anyique use a sander and gloss then crinkle them it will be good when i am done i also have been wiorking on backgrounds for my livejournal if you like any you can hav  them i will be putting up new ones on my dummy fomat i will leave them a few days then change if you want check this site out periodically and tell me if you like them i save the programs so i can send them to you 

        the site is http://www.livejournal.com/users/stmarys_church/ but for full effect push F11

     so what do you think tell me reammy i worked on it for awhile to get all the coordinates right. well i think i need to go i got to get stuff done i will be back later to tell you more of my day. and last week."

     well i titled this school only cause i am in english class right now reall bored we are going over the stuff for the mid-term. this teacher reminds me of mrs. hatefield and ms. sparkman combined ahhhh. she is nice and all but really odd. i do not know i just feal like i am back in elementary english. i am not really complaining i just feel bored. maybe it is cause mr. cook was so hard on us that this class seems especially easy.
     there is really nothing for me to do in thi class because i am supposed to be writing a descriptive essay and we are just going over the topic sentances and thesis right now she gives us both of those and then we write. no joke we are supposed to write a descriptive essay about the stuff at the fair like the food the rides and stuff. it is rather interesting i suppose but really i do not know how this is supposed to help us.
     well today i am gonna park cars in the lot for the fair from five to 10 or so it not that fun but i get money off baseball stuff i got to buy. on saturday i am going to park cars from early to like twelve then i am going to the u of m game woohoo. then i might go to the fair i really want to i have not been so far i just have not had time to go yet. maybe i will go on saturday.i do not know i will go one day. well i think i am gonna start on the paper soon so i gtg i will be back later.

     I really hate the doctors office if i could i think i might just get better by myself. it is not that i am sick either i just got to get a physical done. but i get there ten minutes early just in case then i get in the office on time then i have to wait in the room like thirty minutes i actually fell asleep oncewhile i was in there. it was not good i mean it was like they forgot about me. then after i did that they took like five second to check me over they left me for another ten minutes. then i had to get stuck by three needles one for the skin test one for a mmr vacine and then one for a sugar blood test. this really sucked ass i mean all that time and it was like five minutes they saw me in all and three needles it sucked. what good comes from the doctor unless it is for stitches or a cast really. i mean i could actually stitch my own cuts really. then i would only need to go for freaking casts on broken bones.

i am sorry but i just hate the doctors office it is not that i am afraid or anything or i hate medicine they just take so much time to do stuff and they are alot of times not good at what they do in the first place. anyway i am going to start looking for a job a waiter job. i know what you might say working with food but really i can do it cause they get awesome tips i am going to try for ronnie grisanties i know his neice oh yeah and maybe houstons nice restaurants so i can get good tips.a friend told me he made 2000 dollars in tips at houstons in one week. just think what grisanties would make.

my other options are the peer (high scale seafood) or a bar in cooper young area. other than a waiter i might be looking for a clothing job maybe dress up nicely act gay go to abercrombie and fitch then i would
have oppurtunity for discount in every clothing store in the mall. except pac sun and express. maybe i would go to express for a job hmm. maybe if american eagle needs people i could get a good review from chris that would be cool to work with chris. it is not that i need a job but i am just bored at night i can do homework on weekends breaks or durring the day in between classes like i already do. it is not like a job would hinder my life except maybe time with sara that would suck but i do not think my job would jump in too much i mean she is working as well so.

i hate free time you know i have to be busy or i am not happy it is just how i am. i even listen to music befor i sleep or watch a movie. calm time is not something i do very often i only do that when i am with sara and i love it but when i am on my own it sucks. well if i do go to get a job i will be back to tell you have a good day.

    well today i started out badly i assumed sara was gonna drive to this thing we were going to and she wasn't. so if i had gone to get her when i found out we would have been late. well it would not have been that bad to be late but she does not like to come in late to something. i realy screwed up i missed out on seeing her this morning and i could have seen her later when i picked her up from work but now i will see her none at all. on top of that i feel bad cause she wanted to go to this thing i think and i messed it up for her.

i just do not know what to do to make it up to her it was just careless of me,but she does not seem to be mad.however i do not think she would tell me if she was dissappointed. maybe she will forget about it after my supprise for her tomorrow.well atleast i hope she does. it is a good plan i think except i am missing one thing.but it will work out.

i have to park cars for the fair today that should be fun not well it is ok i will try to have fun and then i do not get to watch the game it is on ppv grrr. oh crap i gtg ahhhh"

     why is it so hard to shop for a girl i mean really. i got her some stuff i know she will like but i wnat to et a jacket for her. i was gonna get her a purse with the new york sky line but she says she does not like it. you would hink blue jean jacket easy right nooooooooo there is like thrity diiferent styles and colors. there are regular dingy rock splash all sorts of different ones. i found one she would like but they do not have it in the store. they had one in the store but i do not know if she will like it. i am going to burlington coat factory today and the mall with sara tomorrow so i will figure it out i suppose i just do not like the idea of sara picking her own present out. maybe that is just me but i want it t obe a semi suprise but she wantsto go pck it out so i will let her,unless i find one tonight.the other things i got her i know she will like they are great.

     i have to say i love sara with all my heart but i wish i just knew what she wanted she is hard to shop for not because she does not like alot of things but because she doesn't like me buying her things in general so when i get a chance i want it to be really great.well i gtg so thanks for listening.

Bye journal"

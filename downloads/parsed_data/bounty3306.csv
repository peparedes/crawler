"event","WOW so much energy right now!!! I love having LILY HERE. When her and I are together things are so funny.  No matter what!!! We were just laughing how the girls on the floor hate to go to the bathroom by themselves, like they're in high school together.  She was singing to the radio she NEVER does that... Karokee what??  the fact that our desks are 2 feet apart and she'll turn around and yell ""FUCK YOU BITCH!!!""  hahahha I dunno why but she makes everything SO FUN!!!!  I can't wait when we live together in Portland.  I hope she doesn't go home as much as she does now cause I'll miss her.  She doesn't know it but I hate when she goes home, it makes me homesick cause she's like my sister and when she's not here the room is empty and cold.  This weekend I am going home and haven't been home in a month and it'll be the first weekend that she's going to be here.  We never plan our time together. That's why I love the fact that we are roommates cause we would never see eachother.  

It just took me 2 minutes to write this when I have a 4 pager due.. so I am going to get back to that BUT I CAN'T... TOO MUCH ENERGY!!!!"

"event","Im feeling much better now that I got some things off my chest.  Anyways.  Yeah I'm excited Elise and I were talking about naca nationals today and discoverd that we are going to have to save a shit load of money if we want to go.  But we are going to so it's all a matter of getting our crap together.  It's going to be worth it.  Regionals were a BLAST and I met so many people who are going to help me with my major and help me figure out what I need to do.  So I hope I meet even more at nationals.  I REALLY hope it's another bonding experiecne like regionals were because it was great being with some people and not having to worry about (home)work or anything along those lines.  

Looking into the spring semster is going into effect soon! SUPER excited picked out my classes... and now I am going to be on the move over to Portland.  I hope it doesn't suck.. it shouldn't and if it does oh well you live you learn right?  That's how I am going to look at life now.  It's the only way to.  I was talking to my mom the other day and she said something that REALLY touched home she said:
""I''m so glad that you are having such positive things going you are such a good person rose and you deserve such good things in your life just don't let the bumps get you down...well i'm glad that you are staying focused on your studies and you are trying to make a future for yourself because when all is said and done that is the only person you can count on.""
  It's true and I love my mom.  I miss her so much and I really can't wait to get home and spend the holidays with her!!! No matter what mood Im in she puts me in my place."

"event","I dunno if I want to transfer out of here or just move to Portland.  It seems that I need to do something! Everywhere I go I turn around and someone has something bad to say about someone else.  it's childish.  it's lame and it's getting old.  I love the fact that I am here in Gorham for work and it's convient to have a hop skip and a jump to work but I don't care anymore. I need to grow up somewhere and it's not going to happene here.  I think many times that I just want to leave USM all together.  What's the point of being here?  Yeah I have lots of wonderful people... that I never hang out with.  That I never see and when I do it's all about drama and who's talking shit about who.  It's lame.  GROW UP.  I can't deal with any more crap.  I think that a big part is Im burnt out.  I haven't seen my parents ina month. Which is okay but it's been a long month for me.   I would say I lost a boyfriend but it was more of a gain of self freedom.  and I 've come close to loosing a best friend.  Which I can see it happening soon becasue we talked last night and we see eachother in different directions.  It's so hard because people grow up and they move on and you see that AFTER it happens.  One of the worst feelings that could ever happen to someone has happened to me twice this month.  Then getting sick from going to naca was the HIGHLIGHT of it all I call my mom and she said not to come home because I was sick.  SO now I dunno when I can go home.  ALL I WANT IS A HUG!"

"event","ONE OF THE BEST SONGS TO DESCRIBE EVERYTHING at the moment:



""Welcome To My Life""  -Simple Plan

Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place?
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you
Do you ever wanna runaway?
Do you lock yourself in your room?
With the radio on turned up so loud 
That no one hears you screaming

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels all right
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you 
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more?
Before your life is over
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding


No one ever lied straight to your face
No one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy but I'm not gonna be okay
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
Never had to work it was always there
You don't know what it's like, what it's like





all I can say is... WOW... this song describes EVERY moment of this year (so far)  



let's see life's been kinda weird this year and it's not that it hasn't been for everyone.  Just one fucking stress rollercoaster where I want to stop the ride.  But no one wants to listen!"

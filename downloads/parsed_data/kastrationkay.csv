If anyone reads my entries, they must notice that I occasionally paste some Stephen Lynch lyrics in or have him as my current music. Well, I've been so psyched about it ever since I got the notification via e-mail. Stephen Lynch and Mitch Hedburg are co-headlining a tour all fall! That's awesome...and what's even more great...is that they will be in Boston on November 6th! I definitely want to see that show because I've never been to a comedy show before and both comedians are hilarious. If you haven't heard of them, here's <A href=""http://www.mitchhedburg.net/"">Mitch's web site</A>, and here's <A href=""http://www.stephenlynch.com/"">Stephen's</A>. It will be so awesome, provided the show is not 18+. I would just crawl into a hole and cry, because I always seem to get the shit end of the stick when it comes to things like this. But if I can go, it will be on the same day as the SATs, so it will be kind of like a reward to myself for taking the damned test twice haha. I just thought I'd write about that because I'm waiting for Stacey to get dressed. Then, we're going to her mother's house so she can make the CHEESECAKE :oP. Ta ta everyone...</P>"

I couldn't care less though because I like to be alone sometimes. Not all day though. For most of the afternoon I sat on-line. Then, stamped more Avon books because the second of the three orders came today, which sucks, considering I'm not the Avon lady and don't get paid for this crap. Eventually I showered, took the Jimmy to get gas, picked up my paycheck, deposited it at the bank, then went for a drive around the fort. I hate being stuck behind SLOW drivers. It was the first time I actually got to the truck, go for a ride, etc. in a while. Now I have nothing to do.

"event","Ashley and Corey came over today. We cooked some burgers on the grill. It was nice to have people here for once.
But some unfortunate news...my dad had a check-up at Mass. General today, and was admitted (meaning he has to stay overnight). They had to give him three pints of blood and take out the stent they had put in because of a blockage. He also had to have an endoscopy, as well as a biopsy because something is wrong :o(. I think he will be okay. I hope he will. I don't want to see him stuck in the hospital for another few months. He deserves better. He busts his ass all the time, and tries hardest, even if he will never be back to normal again. He barely has enough money from disability to pay for things. What he gets is definitely not enough to support a family of our size, but that's okay, because they give others w/o families more money! Most of his check goes to the mortgage and utility bills. My mom needs to get off her ass and get a job. She just quit Avon. If I had a family to support I wouldn't be sitting around. It pisses me off and it's sad to see my dad depressed because he can't do things he could just a few years ago. It's sad to see someone that actually has ambition and that actually wants to work, who can't ever fully recover because working as much as he used to would put him back in the hospital. It makes me sick to see some who can do so much more than my dad is capable of anymore, but they don't. They collect a check from the government when they are fully capable of working. Not all, but some. I know some people are on disability for a reason, so I'm not criticizing them. This isn't directed toward anyone I know. It's about the people I see with nice houses that didn't earn such a luxury, and all of the other gluttonous bastards. I would feel guilty if I were on disability or something similar. Working makes my anxiety worse but I can't see myself doing nothing. I'd feel more worthless than I already do. I need help but I don't want to take financial hand-outs. I want to talk to someone who can maybe help me figure things out. I don't want to be like this. I want to be able to handle the most difficult people and difficult tasks without breaking down. This entry isn't about me though. It's about my dad, and I hope everything turns out okay. I just gotta try thinking positively for once. For everything. And stop letting everything aggravate the shit out of me. That's all for now. Good night..."

Today I did Avon with my grandmother from about 10:30am until about 1pm, showered, visited Jackie at Lowdowns, dropped my proofs off at the studio again, went out to eat with Caleb at the Ying Dynasty :oP, and went to Ashley's house. I think some things are really fucked up, but I can't have an opinion and I don't want to start anything. I just really hate it. Well, I'm going to go eat some shrimp chow mein. Ta ta..."

"event","My right shoulder and my lower back have been hurting for a few days and I have no idea why. It must be my bed because it's not the most comfortable thing in the world. I just hope it passes soon because I feel like crap. 

Yesterday I was home. I never went out once, except to get the mail and my grandmother's laundry. I did some laundry during the day, went on-line, sat around, felt bad for some things, sat around some more, talked to Jackie on the phone. I was going to go see a movie with Ashley yesterday but Caleb had to work on his car first and by the time he was done, I didn't feel like going anywhere. I just watched this show ""Big"" with Caleb, where they go for world records by making huge versions of things, such as a barbecue grill, which was what they built last night. Pretty interesting. 

Today the Avon is supposed to come :o/. I had to put in THREE Avon orders Sunday because everything was screwed up and we never got two of the campaigns, so today should be lovely. Blah...I need to go to Mare's studio again because they returned my proofs and  order form, saying I didn't clarify the image numbers when I thought I did. Well, I don't to type this anymore. Ta ta for now...

P.S. Now I'm realizing it. I'm sorry :o/. I think others should be sorry too, though because I wasn't the only one that said things."

"event",": NEWSWEEK reports that George W. Bush, appearing before a right-to-life rally in Tampa, Florida on June 17, stated: ""We must always remember that all human beings begin life as a feces. A feces is a living being in the eyes of God, who has endowed that feces with all of the rights and God-given blessings of any other human being."" Bush repeated his error at least a dozen times, before realizing that he had used the word 'feces"" when he meant to say ""fetus."""

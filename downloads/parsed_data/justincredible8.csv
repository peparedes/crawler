"event","<strong><em>this weekend was extremely boring. i worked and slept. wohoo. i read my book. it is actually a good book. it is a very sad book though, i feel bad for this poor girl. the paper due today will be easy, i mean its just my opinion, it cant be too hard. i just got to make sure i know what to talk about, and make it long enough, because i can give my opinion in one sentence. im not very good at making papers long. so hopefully i can manage that. class is about to start.</em></strong>"

"event","ok so i finished big fish for the second time. still a pretty good book. and this time i have read it more throughly and paid more attention to details so hopefully i will do better on quizzes and stuff. right now im starving, i only have one class on mondays. math from 8-9. then i come home sleep and study. biology and chemistry are going to be hard. i cant wait for it to be summer already. im a texan and prefer it hot than cold. except if the A.C. is not working. then hot is bad. i cant wait for spring break to get here. i get to go to north carolina. and hang out on the beach. if the waves are big enough il get to surf. which i am not very good at, so sometimes i prefer to boogey board or body board. k see yall tomarrow."

That's what you're thinking, and no you're not wrong.
I never heard of you until your last song.
And that shit was whack as fuck, how the fuck are you a Bomb?/

So now that's brought up, I'm like a bomb squad.
Cuz I'ma disable your vocals cords when I pull your cards.
You're named after God, that don't make you better.
Plus I'm Agnostic, so that fact don't even matter./

If you didn't spend your last track on teaching how to rap
Instead of you actually rapping, then you wouldn't be whack.
But instead, you bored the populace with that nonsense.
So now I gotta go extra hard when I drop this./

Just to make this battle even worth watching.
Because knowing you, your dumb ass gonna go off topic.
When people hear Spawn, they pay homage.
But when they hear you, they want the track to stop quick./

I'm not just saying that, because this is actual fact.
I showed niggas your flow, and they said you were whack.
Then they also asked why am I wasting my time?
I told them, ""Yo, don't worry, I ain't wasting my lines./

This kid thinks he's good, so I gotta show him
That he's trash in the booth, just so he would know this.
I'm battling in some competition, he was in the ladder.
My last battle was more challenging, and he didn't battle.""/

No joke, how are you more whack than nonexsistance?
Because that's your career, which is also on your wish list.
I could be a pinata, and you still couldn't hit this
Without a blindfold, because your flow is a gimmick./

I never met a dude who repeats himself in the same verse.
You gotta be stupid as fuck if you think you ain't worse.
Spawn'll spit some shit that'll make your brain burst.
I come to raw on the mic when I recite and spray words./

You sound like the dude who sings, ""Show me your genitals.""
Cuz you review positive don't mean I'm a friend to you.
Your arrogance keeps you alive, so I'm the end of you.
Mad at the world cuz it's yourself that's apprehending you./

Yeah, this is practically a response of a verse.
That wasn't even my battle, so I did do you dirt.
Just to show how easily I could defeat emcees
With their own words, Cuz I be the C/

Y - R- E - Z, Cyrez leave you lifeless.
I should go to your house and fuckin leave you micless.
Just because you have this fuckin sick rhymer's mindset
Minus the sick rhymer's rhymes and plus less rhyming./

Your punchlines are garbage, generic is an understatement.
Don't act as if the Door of Skill closed, and you got your leg in.
That shit snapped in half because you couldn't take it.
What I'm implying is that you lack the brain power to even/

Make it. Spawn's words leave you shakin.
I smoke more chumps than blunts with Jamaicans. Wanna front,
Get stumped, verbal gun leave you aching. I'm out of patience.
Call my ass a burgular the way I throw a break in./

Rapping on my beats about your shitty life.
And how you turned to God, why the fuck you have a mic?
Only reason why people would listen to your EP
Is because of one song, because the beat was by me./

Your fire freestyles leave me a cold and sober.
Next time you ask for a beat, I'll give the cold shoulder.
Game over, you lost, just stop rapping.
A future for you with Hip-Hop is just not happening./


Just been trying to get back into rapping. Figured I join a competition on newgrounds, and this is the latest verse I've conjured against a kid named Jiroh-Bomb. Still patching a few parts on flow, so this isn't the final draft. Just a general idea. Verse meant for 80 bpm."

"event","Been ages. Feels like forever since I've wrote in this thing. Well, I've grown quite a name for myself on NewGrounds.com. Gone far enough to have people send death threats. Good times. As far as the music goes, I found a good group of people who I would like to say is my crew. Good rappers / producers. Mainly Yun Veroz. Got a real underground kinda sound. Also working on an LP, almost done with it. Need like 4 more tracks, and it'll be safe to say that it's completed. Need a new music computer. Preferably a laptop. Producing on the go. Good times."

"event","But yeh, I'm still living. Same old shit, different smell. New days, new faces, same old problems. Drama has been calmed down in real life, but as far as music wise, still always in my little quarrels. Dudes looking to jump me from the Bronx cuz I pulled a lot of cards on them, and they offended. Whatever....

I've been grouping myself with a bunch of musicians. A lot of them of them online, a few of them through family, all a great way to expand my style. My tracks sounding more proffessional, which is always a plus. Learning bout equalizing tracks, and all that other good shit.

Anything else? Um... Graduated HS, starting going to a trade school like a month after. Already almost done with this shit. Pretty difficult shit, damn computers. If I got more to update, or if I need to vent, I'll just post here. =p"

[22:58] leonhartba: lmao
[22:58] cyrez666: No, seriously.
[22:58] leonhartba: I know that xD
[22:58] leonhartba: got pissed at the first stage
[22:58] cyrez666: My team is full of a bunch of douche bags.
[22:59] leonhartba: xD
[22:59] leonhartba: and enimies got spidey sense
[22:59] cyrez666: I should just try to get a mod for a fucking good weapon
[22:59] cyrez666: Nah, I can sneak pretty damn good
[22:59] leonhartba: they see u even if u hiding
[22:59] cyrez666: It's my team that kicks a can or something
[22:59] leonhartba: xD
[22:59] cyrez666: And boom, they turn around
[22:59] cyrez666: I start shooting
[22:59] cyrez666: and waste like 13 bullets on one guy,
[22:59] leonhartba: lmao
[23:00] cyrez666: and it's bad enough that when you reload
[23:00] cyrez666: you throw the entire clip out
[23:00] cyrez666: and the remaining bullets
[23:00] cyrez666: not like that in the other ghost recons
[23:00] cyrez666: and you can't even pick up another fucking weapon until you reach a drop zone
[23:00] leonhartba: wtf?
[23:00] leonhartba: ok...now that I didnt see...
[23:00] cyrez666: thank goodness GRAW2 isn't like that
[23:00] leonhartba: lol
[23:01] cyrez666: and also, they fucking run in my line of fire
[23:01] cyrez666: right in front of me
[23:01] cyrez666: so then it puts my gun down
[23:01] cyrez666: while i'm zoomed in
[23:01] leonhartba: lol
[23:01] cyrez666: then, the fucker moves
[23:01] cyrez666: i eat bullets
[23:01] cyrez666: and he walks away
[23:01] leonhartba: n die
[23:01] cyrez666: nah, i dun die
[23:01] cyrez666: i just get close to death
[23:01] cyrez666: i usually just start at the checkpoint again
[23:01] leonhartba: oh
[23:02] cyrez666: i go through with my shit alway green
[23:02] leonhartba: hehe
[23:02] cyrez666: for the simple fact that any little hit kills you
[23:02] leonhartba: unless ur idiot buddies fuk over
[23:02] cyrez666: yet your team can eat like 30 bullets
[23:02] cyrez666: trust me, I emptied clips in them.
[23:02] leonhartba: lmao
[23:02] leonhartba: out of anger?? xD
[23:02] cyrez666: Basically.
[23:02] cyrez666: Since the fucking enemy is too far away to hit with a normal fucking gun
[23:03] cyrez666: It pisses me off
[23:03] cyrez666: cuz your team doesn't shoot
[23:03] cyrez666: and when you get a sniper rifle
[23:03] cyrez666: you can get an mp5 with only 5 clips
[23:03] cyrez666: I use about 12 in each match
[23:03] cyrez666: and that's even with me saving bullets
[23:03] cyrez666: one shot per time
[23:03] leonhartba: lol
[23:03] cyrez666: no rapid fire
[23:03] cyrez666: so yeah
[23:04] cyrez666: they give you 20 bullets for the sniper rifle
[23:04] cyrez666: 5 clips of 31 for the mp5
[23:04] cyrez666: your team doesn't shoot
[23:04] leonhartba: n those head shots/
[23:04] cyrez666: dude
[23:04] cyrez666: headshots are nonexsistant in this game.
[23:04] cyrez666: no lie
[23:04] cyrez666: I put my team in a corner
[23:04] cyrez666: sneaked to one dude
[23:04] cyrez666: zoomed in at his head
[23:05] cyrez666: pulled, and he fell
[23:05] cyrez666: me thinking he's dead
[23:05] cyrez666: i turn around to run
[23:05] cyrez666: he gets up, and starts shooting me
[23:05] leonhartba: ROFL
[23:05] cyrez666: like he's mother fucking wolverine or something.
[23:05] cyrez666: It really sucks
[23:05] cyrez666: And then! they put the enemy so fucking far from you
[23:05] cyrez666: that your guns won't do shit
[23:05] cyrez666: unless you have a sniper rifle
[23:06] cyrez666: so when you zoom in
[23:06] cyrez666: and you tell your team to cover you
[23:06] cyrez666: they just stand there
[23:06] cyrez666: I was zoomed in, and I saw my dude's camera
[23:06] cyrez666: the tango was right there
[23:06] cyrez666: 4 yards away from me
[23:06] cyrez666: i'm bussin caps in bastids necks and shit
[23:06] cyrez666: i expect my dude to shoot him
[23:06] cyrez666: nope
[23:07] leonhartba: I got pissed of as hell in the first lv, team dont do shit
[23:07] cyrez666: i got shot 5 times before my dude shot
[23:07] cyrez666: i know
[23:07] cyrez666: and they made it so then it's a team fucking effor
[23:07] cyrez666: effort*
[23:07] cyrez666: so if they die
[23:07] cyrez666: you're screwed
[23:07] leonhartba: I give em an order, they run right through the enemy stronghold
[23:07] leonhartba: FFS!
[23:07] cyrez666: but you basically want to kill them since they don't do shit anyway
[23:07] cyrez666: so you figure you can try to loot their bodies
[23:07] cyrez666: But no!
[23:07] cyrez666: wait! 
[23:07] cyrez666: it gets worse!
[23:07] cyrez666: You go alone
[23:08] cyrez666: you're against a wall
[23:08] cyrez666: your team doesn't even follow automatically
[23:08] cyrez666: you figure that they'd have enough common sense
[23:08] cyrez666: but no, you have to pay attention to making orders
[23:08] cyrez666: and the fuckers shooting at you
[23:08] cyrez666: so you're surrounded
[23:08] cyrez666: with a little shitty ass vase as your cover
[23:08] cyrez666: dunno how the fuck you got there
[23:08] cyrez666: but you're there
[23:08] leonhartba: lol
[23:08] cyrez666: you tell your team to come
[23:09] leonhartba: I hate the little order map too..

[23:16] cyrez666: Also!
[23:17] cyrez666: About GRAW!
[23:17] cyrez666: The stupidest thing ever!!!
[23:17] cyrez666: Mounted machine guns are like fucking heaven in that game.
[23:17] cyrez666: For the simple fact that they are 100% accurate, and hit hard as hell.
[23:17] cyrez666: And they have that little casing in the front so you can't shoot them.
[23:18] leonhartba: xD
[23:18] cyrez666: But then, it doesn't make too much sense for the simple fact you won't be able to see shit
[23:18] cyrez666: there's a little peice that shows the forehead, but that's it
[23:18] cyrez666: so yeah
[23:18] cyrez666: I order my sniper to go to the corner and pop him
[23:18] cyrez666: since I have my little faggot mp5 in there
[23:18] cyrez666: they made that gun so bad in that game
[23:19] cyrez666: made me cry the other night
[23:19] cyrez666: so yeah
[23:19] cyrez666: i order my sniper to move in
[23:19] cyrez666: the fucker runs in the middle of the god damned street
[23:19] cyrez666: FOR NO REASON
[23:19] leonhartba: I know
[23:19] cyrez666: It was like 15 feet away from where I told him to go
[23:19] leonhartba: like there is no bbetter way to the location
[23:19] cyrez666: Which was on the same sidewalk that I was on
[23:19] cyrez666: So yeah
[23:19] cyrez666: He goes, runs in the middle of the street
[23:19] cyrez666: Takes like 9 bullets
[23:19] cyrez666: Then dies...
[23:20] cyrez666: So outta anger
[23:20] cyrez666: I rush up
[23:20] cyrez666: 3 bullets
[23:20] cyrez666: full health
[23:20] cyrez666: dead
[23:20] cyrez666: WTF?!
[23:20] leonhartba: lmao
[23:20] leonhartba: head shots from a machine gun
[23:20] cyrez666: Basically.
[23:20] cyrez666: I can snipe better with those guns than I could with an actual rifle
[23:21] cyrez666: You'd figure it'd be the other way around
[23:21] cyrez666: But logic was thrown right out the window as soon as the enemy gets there
[23:21] leonhartba: lol
[23:21] cyrez666: with your dignity and sanity splattered on the wall behind you
[23:21] leonhartba: dead after 3 shots xD
[23:21] cyrez666: No lie dog
[23:21] cyrez666: I was here for bout 5 hours
[23:21] cyrez666: since I woke up
[23:22] cyrez666: dude, I woke up mad!
[23:22] cyrez666: I already knew what was gonna happen
[23:22] cyrez666: yet i tried to prevent it
[23:22] cyrez666: play smarter
[23:22] cyrez666: order my team a bit less
[23:22] cyrez666: run less
[23:22] cyrez666: be very observant
[23:22] cyrez666: next thing you know
[23:22] cyrez666: bout 25 mother fuckers start shooting
[23:23] cyrez666: you try to roll a grenade on the floor
[23:23] cyrez666: only to realize that friction is like 30x stronger in that game
[23:23] cyrez666: so your grenade goes nowhere
[23:23] leonhartba: lmao
[23:23] cyrez666: so you're looking for somewhere to run fast to without getting shot
[23:23] cyrez666: but while all this is happening
[23:23] leonhartba: granades were only fun thing I had
[23:23] cyrez666: your team automatically decides to follow
[23:23] leonhartba: tho it seemed the guy was a professional pitcher
[23:24] leonhartba: he throws those granades..FAR!!
[23:24] cyrez666: and they all get slaughtered by the 10,000 bullets of rape the enemy is sending your direction
[23:24] cyrez666: and you're there, a lone, knowing you don't have a fucking chance in hell to survive
[23:24] cyrez666: so you run around a building
[23:24] cyrez666: and once you start shooting
[23:24] cyrez666: you find out that you're doing better
[23:25] cyrez666: taking down everyone with that faggot mp5
[23:25] cyrez666: silenced
[23:25] cyrez666: and the next thing you know
[23:25] cyrez666: *BUMF*
[23:25] cyrez666: Power outtage.

Broken Heart. 
Shattered Dreams. 
No remorse. 
Tragedy. 
Open scars, 
battling. 
Behold my heart's cavity.


Words spoken from heart, spitting negative remarks.
Shit tearing me apart. Now released from tha dark.
And so it starts, tear these precious thoughts from my precious gods.
Without any lords, who's to reign with brute force?/
And now niggas see it's just us doing justice.
And it's just that people don't see what it just is.
False accusations. Just this gettin published
Nuclear substance. Never lookin back is a must./
Never drown in my sorrows, all these dreams I have borrowed.
Never knowing if I'll be able to see tomorrow.
They say at the end, you tend to think bout the beginning.
So how can people say this is the end without listening?/
This is real talk, coming from a real poet.
A real story, from a kid who is real potent.
Still showing the skills flowing like distilled oceans.
I build visions, my eyes are still open./

Times gettin hard, and it's tearin my heart.
But you gotta accept the fact that I never look back.
All in all, I get up if I fall.
No matter what, stand tall and never look back./
Like a soldier with a sword, I keep moving foward.
Continue taking orders, so I never look back.
So the beat plays the lord, and I just follow along
Cuz it never does me wrong, and it never looks back./

Broken Heart. 
Shattered Dreams. 
No remorse. 
Tragedy. 
Open scars, 
battling. 
Behold my heart's cavity.

Broken Dreams, shattered heart. Relive the massacre.
If there was a way outta here, I wouldn't pass it up.
Probly ghast it up, just to be let down again.
What the fuck is wrong with you?! How can you pretend?!/
That everything is fine, peachy and dandy?
From a blink of humanity, I'm on the brink of insanity.
Reliving in Amity, bring the peace to tha family.
On the seige of pain, my mind is breathing calamity./
Breathe deep, stand still. I said stand still!
Can you hear the calling? They're telling me to kill.
Rejection objecting my entire intellect.
Crossin paths, twines of fate intersect./
Shattered mind, your actions has shattered mine.
Fabricated lies reply when I ask why.
Hear my battle cry, warrior of the west side.
Call me the Disciple of Death with red eyes./
From the blood we have cried, constantly in peril.
They say mind bends and twists to cope with the pain of the world.
But my shit has literally snapped in two.
Giving me a split image that feels like stabbing you./
That's something my original self can't allow.
The love is still around even though you played me out.
I can't be with you, yet you're all I crave.
You're all I fear, all I need till the last time of days./
And within these last rhymes I say, I pray for the best.
If there was a God, he hasn't been my savior yet.
No matter what I do, the results never vary.
One set of footsteps behind me, never been carried./

"event","Good times... Bad times... times that made me feel like time hated me and moved slow as fuck. These past 4 years were full of ups and downs... Gaining new friends, and losing old ones. 

Freshman year... my craziest year... *chuckle* Throwin myself on the floor just for the shits and giggles of many. People thought I was a lunatic... That put me at ease knowing that they thought I was crazy. They were too scared to even walk by me. Heheh... 

Sophomore year... Standing up for things that was forgotten by many who participated. Barely anyone remembers who stood up for their rights that year... It seemed that I was the only one who did. Writing Petitions and shit... good stuff... It was also the start of TdM. I still feel that the family still considers themselves as being part of TdM, since we were basically close as hell. The everlasting memory of Tino. *laughs out loud* Months upon months of his bullshit, then finally... I was able to end the feud, and beat his ass. Also, the year of many relationships beginning... The best year to in my opinion...

Junior year... The year of friendships getting stronger. The year hearts were broken. The year my mind elevated to a point beyond imaginable to the rate it was growing with maturity before. This is the year when I was the strongest. But at the end... Certain things reminded me how fragile I really am inside...

Senior year... The year that we bid farewell and go our separate ways... Many of friendships has ended. Some friendships have just begun... Turmoil is at it's peak, yet no one realizes it. There is more to come, no one knows what the future holds for us...

They say when you're at the end of a certain, you begin to think about the beginning... How it started... What made it most memorable... What made you hate it the most, but made you love it even more. I like the outcome to this chapter of my series called life. Though some people don't put as much thought into this as I do, they'll sure as hell feel the same way... And it's good to know that you've made a difference within some people's lives....

Tragic in a sense, it seems my only hope is captions.
Off a broken axis, I try to hold that last gift.
The feel of that last hit. It seemed that moment was magic./
And every other day I fell that moment was classic.
And now I turn around, you calling a son of a bastid.
Niggas say I'm different when I say I'm done with this rap shit.
Talk behind my back, and ask ""I wonder what happened...""/
There's a difference between skill and rhyming with ad libs.
My flow is poetry, now rap is in a casket.
And now shit is drastic. Don't know who you can laugh with.
Or pack a gat with. Everywhere niggas getting gunned up and blasted./
So watch ya back kid. Choose ya friends carefully.
Keep ya mind wide open, never tread carelessly.
Cuz you best believe ya friends will leave you dead in the streets.
Or stoop as low to put one in ya head as you sleep./"

Clouded by fear, words shrouded the mess, How to forget
The best held back by tears. Thoughts trapped in the net.
Now they appear, loud and it's clear. In & out of the ear.
And now that I steer down to regret, try to down it with beer./
Non-alcoholic, crazy as fuck. Steadily drowing, givin it up.

Not around when they boys go impounded. How they found em?

"event","Today... a hell of a day. The shit starts out with me catching a hockey stick to my face, followed up with an arguement. Then, I talked to one of my teachers about college...seems that I can get somewhere by making blueprints to shit. That sorta shit comes easy to me. Then, held a robotics meeting without losing my temper. That's always a plus. Then, when I get home... my faggot brother wants to start talking shit to me about me wanting to go to the Marines and/or Airforce after two years of being at PCCC. So yeah, I told him to go fuck himself, die a slow painful death, and have a fast ride to hell. Then he starts with my sister in front of his friend saying how she listens to 'devil music.' Yeah... Slipknot maybe pretty damn hardcore, but it sure as hell doesn't worship the devil. So yeah, my sister told him to go fuck himself. Then like 10 minutes later, my brother comes up to me saying that he was only joking. Yeah... jokes are meant to be funny, not ignorant. So me and him was arguing for about 30 minutes. His most quotable line: <i>""I'm the big brother, so that means that you can't beat me...""</i> And then he had plans to go to the military before me, but to try to atone for his mistakes, and do something good in his life. I only plan to go cuz that shit is gonna pay 100% of my schooling. I told him I envy him for his knowledge, because if things came to me as easily as it did him, I would've became something already. Not some fucking 24-year old basehead who lives with his mother and barely sees his daughter due to his heavy drug abuse. I also asked him what did he do in HS that would look good on a resume for college... Nga started talking about shit he did 2 years ago. As for me, I'm already getting an internship working with AutoCad, I've spent for years in the robotics team, which of this year I'm officially president of, I have computers skill beyond that of anyone you can possibly imagine, and I took two years of A+ Certification classes. What has he done? Got high in the hallways, got expelled for fighting, got kicked out of his mother's house for a while, came back, and does absolutely nothing. And he tried to say that I'm alike him in many ways, but only named that I rap. He tried to turn it into a career, and failed miserably. I do it to relieve stress. And the nigga has the nerve to say that he writes because he's stressed too, that's he's been through more. I don't doubt the fact that he has been through more, but the nigga is weak willed, and has been smoking weed to ease his own problems in which he has gotten himself into. As for me, I have no choice but to go the route that's in my path. I was born into my fucking stress, there was no way around it. Period. I never stressed over something that I put myself into, because I knew I did it, so therefore I had to get myself out. But noooo.... This faggot took the easy way out and smoke his pain away. As for me, I can't even get high due to my fucking temper. So I have to deal with it twice as much as he does. So basically... for anyone who cares, his beats are for sell. I can care less of what he has to say. He can suck a dick for all I care..."

So yeah, we got the tracks in, and then when I come home, I found out that there was a shoot out in front of my house like 15 minutes before I got home. More pussies thinkin they tough... Oh well...

I also checked my SAT scores today too, got a lil bit over excited. I thought my score would be all of them added up.

Math: 460
Reading: 420
Writing: 430

Well... it was my first try, and I didn't study for shit. Oh well, I'm happy with that. I don't feel like going to college due to the fact of how much it's been stressing me out. All I got is my music, I don't need a degree to get far in that. I should go for my A+ Certification or something, maybe I could get a good paying job... Like maybe 15 an hour or something... I'll need to look into it.

Well, that was my day... I'm fucking tired..."

I really don't think that he did as much I did. After all, the beat was a collaboration with me and my cousin. So yeah, why don't you guys tell me what ya think between the two beats.

"event","It's been a while since I updated, just thought I'd let ya niggas know how I'm doin. I've been chillin for the most part, playing Mortal Kombat Armaggeddon. I happened to buy it when I stole the nigga's phone who made me catch an anxiety attack a few months back. The dude had a Sidekick 3. I was planning on keeping it myself, but I chose to sell it quickly, and sold it for 80 dollars. There was people who was willing to buy it for more, but the quicker it got out my hands, the better. So yeah, revenge is sweet.

Other than that, I've just been on my grind on music. I'm about to sell two beats, get me some money, and get me some clothes. I need more army gear.

I was supposed to go with Steve and DJuan to tha mall today also, but my mother mad at me cuz some teacher called her saying that I wasn't doing my work. She wouldn't tell me who, like if it wasn't important. If she was to tell, then I'd be able to tell her how I'm doing in the damn class.... It's whatever though. I mainly got classes I don't need this year, so I could care less.

I took the SATs this weekend too, and was supposed to follow that up by going to a job interview. I took the test, shit was long as hell. It wasn't that hard, there was just a shit load of words that no one uses in there. I didn't go to the job interview, I thought I'd just chill, and focus on school more, since I can barely manage homework cuz I'm always making a damn beat. Fuck it, atleast I'm productive.

Well, that's life lately. I'll get up when more shit pops off."

Despite the fact I write in tact is that my life is black.
Faded away with tracks that in no way can bring me back.
Bring it back, the lies are in fact the reason why I rap.
Strayed away until the day I can get my fucking life back./
Asap, I'm quick to blaze tracks, and keep shit to myself.
I'm feindin, believe that I mean it, spittin for my health.
You've seen Richard Medina at his meanest, time for ease.
I'm probably the reason these anamolies are breathing./
I'm possibly just seeing this monopoly just creeping
On top these streets with the hottest things you've ever seen.
Stopping me is seemless the way I'm paving roads like cement.
Dropping shit like birds with shit you haven't seen yet./
Meeting fate with a twist in it, some ballistic shit.
Living rhythm in the flesh, mystic lyrics kickin it.
Sick of this, I'm just sick niggas bitching B.
Die and be free of pain, or live and fight tha misery./"

"event","What would you do if someone who has more authority than you screws you over, you approach them on the subject, and they catch an attitude with you? And just cuz they're in a higher position than yourself, not even the ones closests to you believes you because you're the one who blacked out, and you have a history of anger and what not. And cuz of this, this ruins several opportunities to enjoy yourself in the near future. How would you handle this sort of situation?"

"event","Why is it that everytime I eat out in Paterson, some muthah fucking crack-head comes up to me for money, and has the fucking nerve to touch me like that's going to convince me? I hate it when people touch me, so why have the nerve to touch my fucking arm over, and over, and over like if I'm going to give drug addicts a fucking dollar. Last time one tried to touch my hand, I pulled out training sword and swore to break his damn hand if he touched it. So yeah... today some bitch asked tried talking to me... I looked at her, and pointed at my headphones (which we blasting with music at the time). She comes closer and tried to listen to what I was listening to, but I just stared at her with a mean ass look. She walked back, and started talking with someone else, and then later, got into an arguement with one of the customers in the chicken store I was in. So while I'm there waiting for the food to be done, she asked me for 75 cents, and touched my arm....

This bitch... I didn't black out, I just stayed quiet, but I stared at my arm for like 15 seconds, then looked at her with the same face as before. She was like, 'I guess you don't want me touching you.' I gave her that 'No shit you dumb bitch' sorta look, and she walked away. The next crackhead who even dares to try to touch me again is getting stabbed. I swear, I fucking hate crack-heads.."

"event","Well... I went to school today. Some people asked me if I was fucking stupid. Others said it fits me well. The ones who tried to joke got dissed back, and made looked stupid as hell. For instance, one of the most ignorant people went and told me, ""That's why your big ass head looks like a dick."" Only a few people laughed. I replied, ""No wonder your mother keeps coming for more."" He didn't get it. I was told I'm tha most gangstah/craziest nigga today also. It's not that I'm gangstah or crazy,

Also, I almost got locked up for assaulting an officer... Niggas think they bad cuz they have a badge. Fuck that. 

Also, I chilled with Julio and friends today. Niggas is funny. I applied to several colleges that deal with music production. It's all I know, fuck it. Atleast I have something that could get me somewhere...

Well... I'm tired... I'm sleepy... And fuck Red Bull. Never take Red Bull for free from white bitches... They'll decieve you."

"event","Well, I have some good news, and bad news...

Tha good news is that Julio, Leon, and Kenny are teaming up with me for my album. Julio doing mass production of Cds, Leon doing the graffics, and Kenny managing everything. They said they'll get a mic for me, and we're going to build a studio in Kenny's basement. They're willing to pay like 300 for a mic, maybe even more. So yeah, that's some good shit.

Tha bad news is that I gotta re-record a couple of songs. Not only that, I have to tell them niggas stop planning shit without me. They already started coming out with themes to instrumentals that I already gave to other people. And also, some of their themes are like... all martial arts and shit. Capoiera, a ninja master, the works. I told em that not much people would feel that sorta shit, so that'll just be a waste of time. (no offense guys)

I need to speak with them in person, and show them all the instrumentals that might be on the album. So yeah, we're starting tomorrow on the studio. Well, all we need to build is a booth, and then get some long ass wires to connect everything. It should be all good. I'll update tomorrow to let niggas know how shit went.

Also! I just put up a new song on my music page on Myspace. Feel free to check it out, it's called 'War.' (I couldn't think of a better name, hopefully I'll figure something out)"

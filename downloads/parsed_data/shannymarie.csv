"event","I just wanted to see if this account is still active. I am in a point in my life I want to re-read my old posts and move on. I am 29 years old now and I feel I am having kind of a life crisis. I am trying to hold on to people that seem to not want me in their lives anymore or at least that is my perceptive. I am a negative thinker. My nickname in undergrad was the voice of negativity but I feel maybe that's just my mind set and I don't like it. Thinking negatively causes me stress and anxiety. This anxiety is something I've suffered alone with for far to long and one reason I am writing again is to help release some of that anxiety. I find it strange that I tell people to seek counseling on a daily basis but for myself I could never go. I think it is because I don't want someone diagnosing me from one meeting. I've already diagnosed myself. I have an obsessive compulsive personality disorder. I want to control all aspects of my life and that is impossible. I know this rationally but I cannot help wanting to be in control. All this control causes stress. Especially when it comes to people. You cannot control others actions, thoughts or how they treat you. I feel lots of people come and go out of my life and I always internalize it. However it isn't personal it is part of growing up living our individual lives. This all I know... Rationally but still I get upset and sad when those relationships fade. There are not many people I can count on. I have a small number maybe count them on one hand of people that I feel will be there for me but I still want to rekindle those relationships that seem to be lost. Relationships are important. In life you will always have those memories with those people. But sadly memories is mostly all I have. It seems people come and go out of my life quickly. Do they think about me as I think of them? I always wonder this but never get an answer. I am grateful for those few that stick around but I wonder about those others so very much. When will people slow down in life and maybe remember what used to be important to them... Was I ever important. I guess I'll never truly know and this I need to come to terms with and move forward and move on and remember those good memories. My fictional soulmate had it right when he said don't tell anyone anything or your start to miss everyone. Yet I don't live like that. I can't because with all my flaws, negativity and anxiety I still thrive on the company of others. So I guess I wait and see if I am important to those that I find and keep so important to me in memory and in my heart!"

"event","My mind is a scary place. I try to not to think too much because when i do, things like this happens. 

I have always wondered if i was attracted to women if my parents would hate me more. I love my husband very much. But i have always wondered if i was a lesbian if that would be the nail in the coffin of my relationship with my parents, I suppose it is a good thing i enjoy the penis. 

my parents... or maybe just my father do not like me. They do not want to get to know me. They do not like people who are different from them. I am everything they are not. I am open minded, super liberal and a humanist and believe there is no god and hate there military and america. However with these statements there is more to me then that. I am peaceful and hate murder and hate hate and pain and suffereing of any kind, either it be of americans or any other people. Therefore I do not respect the military of any country. 

I do not understand why if you live in the USA you think you are a special kind of human. Why do we think our countries = our idenities? I love john lennon he had it right saying there should not be countries, possions or religion. But however we live in a society where people believe they need faith, land and things. So i will be the odd one and the one hated for not supporting ""the troops or america"" 

My goals in life seem to have changed a lot over the years. I kind of wish I would have never went to college. I would not owe all this debt and could do one goal of mine, which is to travel the world, and maybe i would start here by selling the car and using the money to buy an old rv and travel and bum it. these experiences would be more vaulable then this so called education i recieved from hanover college that got me nowhere, but working two crappy jobs i could have got out of high school. Maybe i am just restless and need a move and start a new life. 

because i feel stuck.... stuck in the same body, life and jobs that i hate. There is only a few things in this life i live that i enjoy. I enjoy Daniel, Jade, Abby, CDs, Movies and my bike (that i got to ride for the first time yesterday since daniel built it for me for christmas). 

I feel so old and lost now adays, I stay up days at a time to go from one hated job to the next to make shit money to be spent as soon as i get the check on bills for a shit education im not using. I seem pissed and irraible all the time. 

I need a new plan, new place to live and a new happy life. 

I want to be happy like i used to be... I want something to look forward to... I want so many things, and have no plans on how to get them... ok im done ranting.... sorry to depress you if you read this... but misery does love company!!"

"event","OK so it has been a while, and my life pretty much sucks post Hanover. I am here to update about what my life has become and how i hate it right now, so if you dont want to read about it stop now.... Ok, So post -Hanover I went and worked at the theatre while looking for another job, I was there all summer and become concession manager so i got a raise to a whole 8 dollars an hour wow. Then by the end of September i got a job at a place called residential concepts where i work 3rd shift, where i only make 10 dollars an hour, an only required a high school education. So i work two jobs. I have to work both these jobs to pay for my student loans that start this month.. and by this month i mean December. I will be paying a total of 1100 dollars a month on bills, and that only includes, student loans, car, car insurance, phone and gas. So i still live at home 26 miles away from my loving boyfriend, who i only see once a week if that because i work two jobs. I hate that i have to work two jobs to pay for an education that has gotten me no where so far. This economy i graduated into sucks. I just want to work a job where i make something around 15 dollars an hour, 40 hours a week, monday thru friday first shift. I want it to be something i love and excited to go into and not dread. I would still keep my job at the theatre for something like 20 hours a week or less just for the perks and the people. That job isnt bad as long as im not there for long times, about 8 hours a day is my limit haha. 

So the only good things i have going on for me is my man Daniel. He is simply amazing and I barely get to see him and it sucks. I want to live with him and start my life with him but with the two jobs i barely can live now, let alone adding more bills. Blah life. I never signed up for this, when they explain college in high school they say that its worth the money because you will be making enough to live and pay off the debt and be very educated. Well i have the education and debt... and where is that getting me but in the poor house and at my parents. Plus my dad hasnt worked for almost 9 months, he does have an interview friday but who knows if he will get it. So life here is hard. I want to be happy and have time to have fun, im 22 years old, i shouldnt be so stressed out and tired all the time, but that is what my life has become. I miss my friends from college, Larissa in particular, I miss Daniel all the time, and Lauren has been distant lately but that is a whole other situation that stresses me out too and dont really want to talk about now. Also, I would like to see those friends I used to be close to and have some how just disappeared out of my life, You know who you are. Does growing up mean, growing apart, in my experience it seems so... I wish things would just change!!

Oh Life, I did not sign up for this!!"

However, It is an unique color and it is a hatchback... My bills are going to be expensive now.. I hope i find a job that is worth the schooling.

"event","OK so I am on my last spring break... And i am fucking stressed out. I went to get a new car and didnt think i would have a problem because i am empolyed and have a credit score of 729.  Yet they said my income isnt good enough.  So i need a co-signer or it is a no.  and i start to freak out, because without a car, i cant work and without work i cant pay my student loans off in a couple months when those payments start coming in.  I should be so happy that i am graduating and will have a BA May 23rd... but i am not.  I am stressed that i will be a failure because i wont be able to get a job, and wont be able to make my payments.  Also, my parents are stressing me out because my dad got laid off and the company is closing so, he keeps talking about losing the house.  Im freaking out.  I am about to have an anxiety attack because there is nothing i can do.  So i mentioned to him that i was going to charge a car for 3000 dollars and make big payments. and he hates that idea becausse of the lemon i got before.  Now i hear that my cousin might co-sign for me... I dont know though, Im scared! I know i will be making payments on time and that isnt a problem, i just dont like that pressure of him name on my car and my dad's name on my student loans. My life feels so scary, and the worse part is i feel like a teenager in an adult body and world.  I dont know why i feel like that, maybe because people have never treated me like an adult.  I wanted my independence yet i cant even do that because the banks wont give me a loan.  But to get a great car should i not take the help being offered?  I dont know... im confused and scared."

"event","So last night I got into an argument with Daniel, about nothing serious, it was stupid, yet i pushed and pushed the subject, he asked me many times to drop it and i couldnt, I am a pusher.  I push myself to do 50 things at once, and i push others until they dont want to be with me anymore.  He went to bed mad, and when i woke up this morning, i was ashamed of my actions and words.  But that is what i do, i push people until i get answers and until i understand what they are saying. Yet, i shouldnt have pushed him because apparently it is a senstive issue, but i just couldnt understand that. 

I dont know, He says he is over it, that he loves me and isnt going anywhere... yet i have this feeling of being ashamed and sad and ive been crying all morning because i feel disconnected from him and actually i have a feeling of it being over.... 

I could blame all this on hormones, because thats where the conversation started and then i got my monthly menstrual cycle this morning.  

but i will not blame it on hormones because it feels like i am a fuck up at everything i try to do.  Maybe i am not supposed to be happy, and not supposed to be in a loving relationship.  Maybe i should end it now, before i mess his life up too. It hurts me to even type those words, because to lose Daniel is my worse fear currently, but I think that he deserves better and that I am not the right girl for him, because all I do is push him and not listen to him when he is uncomfortable. 

I am a pusher, I push myself to be a good student and graduate, I put pressure on myself to get a good job and have great credit, but i do these things because it is in me.  But i dont think having a healthy strong relationship is meant for me, I always do something to fuck it up. I always push the man i am with to be someone he isnt or express his feelings when he isnt comfortable.  I am a fuck up and a pusher... What should I do.  

I love Daniel, but he is better off without me in his life.... But i am not better off without him in mine... what do i do... I know what i have to do right now... and that is go to class because I push myself to get over my emotional break downs and do what has to get done. 

I am a pusher... FUCK!!"

"event","I had a great weekend. I am on winter break from school, which means there is half a semester and a month left of school. OMG i graduate at the end of may, that is ridiculous.  

Anyway, This weekend I came into town and Daniel wanted to see me of course, so he sweetly offered to ride 15miles one way to milford to watch a movie with me.  We meet up at Showcase where we saw Taken.  This is a great fucking movie... the ending wasnt the best I didnt think, but over all a good movie.  Daniel is an amazing man, I love him so much.  He gave me a 25cent ring he got out of one of those toy quarter machines.  its cute, so now i wear that ring and a bracelet he got me out of another machine.  I havent taken either of them off yet.  Daniel and I have been dating now for 2 and half months.  It is amazing, and we are met for each other, i dont know how i know, we just know... its weird.  Anyway, after the movie, I took him to texas roadhouse, it was a great dinner and it was fun eating and talking to him.  Then we made out a little in the car, and then walked around Walmart, where we were being goofy taking random pictures of me wearing different hats or holding fruit up or toys.  It was a lot of fun. We were just so happy being around each other and being giddy. Then the night had to come to an end.  We kissed some more and i drove him back to his bike at the movie theater and we said i love you and goodnight.  He got home safely and said that he would had riding 30miles to see me if he needed to.  I think he is the sweetest guy i have ever dated and I am so lucky to have met a man like him, this is what ive been wanting and waiting for all my life.  He is perfect for me, and thinks im perfect for him, and we complete each other. This is real and this is it :).

So Saturday Lauren came over and picked me up, because her boyfriend's birthday is monday so we were doing out to celebrate.  Lauren and I watched a movie and then we all played phase 10.  Then we went to play pool, I actually didnt have the best time, I missed Daniel, but it got better as the night progressed.  We went to Ihop after playing pool and we ate and then I sleep on the couch.

Sunday Lauren took David to training (he is going into the National Guard) so he has training one weekend a month until he leaves for basic at the end of June.  Then around 11 Lauren and I had lunch at TGI Fridays, and then played board games all afternoon.  David got done around 330, and then we watched tv until around 520, then we to watch a free movie at my movie theater, we saw Unborn, another good movie. then ate some dinner and they took me home.  

It was a great weekend, I love my friends and I love my boyfriend. Today, Monday, I went to the dentist which i love the dentist and I have healthy teeth yay. And tonight I will be working tonight at the theater and most of the week I am sure.  So, I have some school work to do this week, and working nights, then back to school on sunday, where the month of march will be very very busy and april will be busy with wrapping up the semester and May should rock, one class, one month, then graduation.  I am excited to start my life, as a true adult, get my car spring break and start my life with my wonderful sexy boyfriend in June, and hang out with my amazing friends, plus hopefully get a great job that I love. I am being optimistic for once in my life and i am happy about that. Ok i am done now, until next time. ""live in the now""--waynes world"

However, the future still has me freaked out. I dont have any job offers and i dont know where to apply. And i fear when i do apply and if i get an interview i wont be able to go to the interview because i dont have a car.  I cant wait until april or may when i can go buy a car and yeah ill have car payments, but a new car wont be a lemon and i wont have to worry about them breaking down. 

Daniel and I are doing wonderful. He is amazing. He told me i could apply to anywhere in the world and where ever i get a job, he is willing to move to just to be with me and start a life with me. We have known each other only for a couple of months but it feels like years (in a good way).  We feel we were meant to have met and just meant for each other. He is amazing and the best thing to have ever happened to me. I get to see him again on the 21st and i get to stay the night with him. I am really excited about this. This relationship is real, intense and just right. I just know we are meant to be and he is the one. Well that is about all i have to say right now. Love you all.

"event","So here i am back at school for my last semester. It feel weird because i dont feel very connected to friends here anymore.  I think i am preparing myself for the end, when i lose a lot of friends because we dont stay in contact, though i am sure we all will say we will. I have 5 months left and i will have my BA, and no job and no future... I am scared and i dont know what to do with my life.  I have already started job applications, but its not realistic when you cant start until June 1st. I am taking some nice classes through. I have my Independent Study, which the survey part should be up and running by monday i hope. sociology of gender which i am taking pass/fail and i really like so far.  Classical indian philosophy, which i know i will like and it is already interesting. Also, i am taking psychotherapy.  I am nervous about this class, because our coursemates get to watch us do some sessions with people. that is kind of scary if you ask me.  Oh well, it will pass.  There is two major things that give me anxiety when i think about them, comps (the exam in which tells me if i pass college) is feb 7th. and my independent study will be presented at Butler U april 17th. These two things stress me out so much, and i hope i will be able to pass them so that i can chill and realize yes i am not going to be a failure and actually have a BA by may 23rd. 

On another subject, my relationship with Daniel is going very well. He is the man of my dreams, and i have found him to be a great friend as well as a lover. I am happy we have met each other. Summer of 2009 will be amazing and i hope goes the way i want it to go. Well i am going to go do some school things. Have a great day all that read this thing.

"event","The only day of the week I was looking forward to was tuesday.  It was my only day off work and the plan was to hang out with Lauren, David and Daniel.  Well needless to say it didnt happen becuase the ice on the roads fucked everything up.  I was so disappointed and complained like the whole night on the phone with Daniel. He is so hopeful for our relationship and is so chill.  I love how he doesnt like the distance and not seeing each other much get his hopes down.  Then after that disappointing night, I worked Christmas eve from 12 to 4.  Then i went to Willie and Joe's house (adopted grandparents). It was fun to see everyone and catch up.  Joe told me he will get my a deal on a brand new car in May, because he just retired from Hyundai but he can still get me a deal.  So i plan on getting a new Accent hatchback at the end of May.  Then after leaving their house, Chris and Erin came over we exchanged gifts and chilled for a while then they left and mom and dad went to bed.  That is when i got all depressed because everything seemed so different this year.  Then i went to bed because i was down and nobody wanted to talk to me.  The next day was christmas.  I worked from 1230 to 10 in the box office giving tickets out.  We were not busy at all.  But Cyndi (the assistant manager and good friend) had Roswell so we watched some of that, so that kept me entertained.  Also, Daniel texted me all day because he knew i was working, also, because he was all alone on Christmas, how sad is that. We were apart on the holiday.  it made me a little depressed.  Friday came and Lauren asked me to hang out after work and i was like sure. So, we planned to go to Jefferson Hall on the leeve.  Next thing i know, our double date happens friday... so yes i got to see Daniel again.  It was a magical night.  We didnt leave each other's side and he held my hand the whole night. and we made out a little it was nice. We have this strong connection and i can not explain it because i have never felt this way before.  Like when we look in each other's eyes, there are sparks and it is such an intense feeling i have to look away.  It was an amazing night. and i am forever grateful to have friends like Lauren and David, that would offer to go out of their way to pick my boyfriend up to hang out with.  We all have good chemistry and i think this 4some is a good thing.  I think we all make great friends. Yesterday, i hung out with Lauren and at lunch we talked about plans for after i graduate.  As of right now we plan on getting a 3 bedroom house and us 4 living together and she is going to try to help me get a job at her work.  It seems my life is coming together. I have an amazing boyfriend, great friends, im going to be graduating in May and getting reliable transportation.  so right now i need to worry about passing all my classes so i do graduate and then job searching to make money to move out and make all my dreams come true.  well i need to stop looking towards the future and ""live in the now""  have a great sunday everyone!"

"event","So this year christmas eve and christmas has not been the same and i am very sad about this.  As most of you know, the person in my family i was closes to died before christmas last year.  We she was the glue that kept this family together.  After she died, my dad's side of the family came over to our house for christmas eve last year to keep the tradition of getting together alive.  However, this year it was totally different. i worked from 12 to 4, which was boring and pointless, we didnt do much business at the theatre.  Then i came home, we got ready and went to my adopted grandparents house.  It was fun, but not many people were there.  Then i went with chris and erin to get their presents for mom, dad and me.  Then we came over mom and dad's and did our christmas... which we normally do christmas morning but i volunteered to work 1230 to 10 tomorrow (which i regert now because im going to be lonely and feel unloved).  well that was change number 1, we open our gifts from each other and they were nice gifts, i got classic black and white chucks, very bring colored socks, flannel pjs, and gift cards, one to JC Pennys and one to McDonalds.  it was very nice of everyone, since i know we were hard up for money this year just like everyone else.  So after that change, nobody from dad's side of the family came over.... that was really weird.  It is weird and sad to deal with change like that, because since i can remeber i have seen that side of the family on christmas eve.  It is sad how losing one important piece of the family, the whole family falls apart.  More importantly, i dont feel happy this year because, i have no grandmother as i mentioned, also, the important people in my life as miles away from me.  I just want to be hugged by my best friends and my boyfriend.  I feel so alone, i know my parents care about me, but they just dont understand me and judge me a lot.  Therefore, my true family are those that care for me despite our differences and accpet me for my opinions and love me unconditionally.  I am so sad this year... i think i will go to sleep and dream... then get up tomorrow and go to work BLAH.  Oh well please text me or email me.. if you have happy things to say. Merry Christmas... I suppose... ""that lamp was electric sex"""

"event","Saturday I went and hung out with Lauren all day. This included eating fast food and drinking screw drivers.... needless to say didnt end well haha.  I drank a lot, threw up taco bell, washed my clothes,which means i walked around in a bra all night, and made a fool of myself on the phone with Daniel.  Lauren and I were in bed by 930pm... how sad are we.  Sunday went a lot better. Lauren, David (Lauren's boyfriend) and I went and got food at O-Charleys.  I did not eat much because i had a stomach ache.  Then I came home got ready and went and met Daniel at his house in P-Ridge. I was so happy that he still wanted to meet me after how I acted on the phone.  He is excatly the same in person as on the phone and internet.  We connected very well and had a great time talking, playing cards and just hanging out together.  We kissed it was so nice. After kissing a little he looks into my eyes and says ""Shanna you are my girlfriend now right?""  It was so sweet and romantic, I said of course and we kissed more. It was an amazing moment.  Then, around 5:40 we left to meet Lauren and David at the zoo by 6pm.  We get near the Zoo and there is so much traffic, that we did not get parked until 6:20pm.  Then i call Lauren and she says they are in traffic and just go ahead and wait for them by the enterance of the Zoo. So Daniel pays for both of us, for our offical first date.   We wait until around 7pm for Lauren and David, then we go into the Zoo.  We walk around the Zoo looking at the lights and animals, Daniel buys his and my dinner and we all just hang out and have a lot of fun.  Around 9:20 we head back to his place, where we have a great goodnight kiss and I go home.  He is the most amazing man I have ever met.  I have never felt like this so quickly for someone.  I would not say I love Daniel, because we have only known each other about 3 weeks, but I am quickly falling for him.  I feel it is meant to be and he says he feels the same way, which is nice.  It is nice to have a man that isnt afraid of his feelings, and will share them with you.  He is smart, talented and just all around amazing.  Its so weird he is like perfect for me. I am so happy and a lucky woman to have found him. I cant wait to be with him more.  He even said we will keep in communication because it is likely i wont see him again until i graduate, and when i said that to him, he says we have our whole lives to be together Shanna, you get your education, i am not going anywhere.  He truly likes me :). I am happy :)  Have great days all! ""Why so serious??"""

How am i suppose to prove to an employer that i am the right person for a job if i cant even do school work. I think i am just scared to graduate because i dont have a plan for after May. 

My life seems to be coming together however, because ive always said i wanted to be with someone when i graduate and know there is a future with that person. Though i yet have meet Daniel in person (which will happen next week when i get home), we both have strong emotional and mental feelings for each other. Actually it seems to be too good to be true. It is actually pretty scary for both of us. But who knows where my future lies, i cannot predict my future. 

All i do know is i have to graduate and 6 months after i graduate i will have bills, and lots of them, fucking student loans. I hope to eventually go to ireland... so if anyone wants to help me plan that trip, im thinking summer 2010, anyone up for going?  Well have a great day. ""im getting to old for this shit"""

"event","So last night i read some of these rediculous post. i was so immature i dont know what i was thinking, talking about love and boys.  Well lets stay in that tradition and tell you about a dream i had last night which will lead into tell you about this guy... OK so i have this crazy dream last night, that i was at a party and every guy i have ever had a crush or relationship was there.  The thing is they were all kissing girls except one, which was jeremy brownlee.  Jeremy hugged me and we sat on a couch and he was drunk and i had a drink in my hand.  Next thing i know jeremy's arm is around me but hanging down between my breast and im just chilling. A girl looks at us and say i hate when people who dont belong together get together. Jeremy quickly removes him arm and says oh me and shanna arent together we are just good friends, id rather be with you. He gets up and starts kissing this girl.  Then i walk outside and drown myself in some more alcohol.  At this point of the dream i cant even walk, and as im about to fall to the ground, Daniel catches me and says you saved my life, now its my turn to do that for you. That is when i woke up. what kind of fucking dream was this huh? I dont know what it means but it has to mean something.

So, ok let me tell you about Jeremy and Daniel.  Jeremy is this wonderful man on this campus, that ive said he would be the only person on this campus i would date. He is smart intelligent and awesome. However, he is a huge flirt and we are just friend even though i thought i liked him a lot once, but that has no passed because i know jeremy and i are meant to only be friends, and i appreciate him friendship.

Next is Daniel, oh Daniel. I posted a craigslist ad a couple weeks ago and i get this email last week from Daniel and i answer back because he seemed like a great guy.. and i was right he is.  We talk online for about 7 to 8 hours everynight and we have so much in common.  I have never felt this way for a guy before, like i loved jerry you all know that, but with Daniel its like this connection of emotions and the mind. Also, i understand him and he understand me. We plan on meeting in person next week sometime, probably sunday it looks like. I have strong feelings for him already and it scares me. I always get hurt when it comes to guys and im scared to fully open my heart to this possibility even though i like him so much. Do you think you can like someone that much over the interenet? or am i just crazy?  I dont know the answer to that, but for some reason i feel we were suppose to meet and get to know each and be together. Who knows i dont know where my future lies and at this point in reality i would like to live one day at a time. So, i think i need to stop having such intense feelings and just listen to my mind for a while. I dont do that enough. though at this point my mind says he is a great guy too and i need to give it a chance and i know i am going to. I like him, i truly do, and who knows this might be good for me... 

BTW i was reading through this as i mentioned at the top and i used to end on random quotes, usually from movies.. why did i ever stop that, it was a fun way to end these post. So i will start again now. "" let what may, let what may.."" That was from moulin rouge."

"event","First off happy election day :). I hope everyone votes. Next, there is this car that someone at my parent's church is selling it is a silver ford escort with 92K on it, he wants $1200 dollars for this car. Mom calls me today and says, ""how much money do you have in the bank"" i say $1000 dollars, and you she preceeds to tell me about the car.  Why would she tell me about it when i cant buy it since i only have $1000 and not the asking price?  Now i am excited that i could get this car, because i need one badly, but i dont even have enough for it, and the Kia died which means even if it isnt sold by the end of December i cant work to get money for it because i dont have a car.  This is an evil circle. I am upset, i really need a car, because i will be graduating in May, and how am i suppose to fill out applications and get a good job if i can not go anywhere, and soon i will have bills to pay which means i have to work.  I hope everything works out in my favor, but nothing ever does, so i dont think i will get this car. But it is good to dream. I wish someone would just offer me $400 dollars, and i would pay them back after christmas. Oh well, here is wishing.

BARACK THE VOTE :) i will be watching the results of the election very very late :) much love all."

"event","It has been a long time.  That is because i find my life is boring and have no reason to write.  Currently i am sitting at home in batavia because my school has closed campus and cancelled classes for week due to no water.  These wind storms really did a number on electric and little towns.  So here is the update of my life.  I am a senior and i dont feel like doing at work, however i have tons to do.  So i am glad i am off school because it will let me caught up.  Next, i am single and i really not enjoying it.  i never thought i would be one of those girls that ""needs"" a man, but it seems it would be nice to have someone that thinks about me all the time and wants  to be around me.  Maybe one day ill find that person.  I am not very depressed about it or worried about it.  so maybe i dont need a man to be happy.  Even though i have a lot of work to do as a senior, i keep thinking of the future, like grad school applications, the GRE, moving out of this house and living on my own...which means bills so i need to find a good job.  i guess i've always needed school to feel like i didnt need to grow up.  yes i consider myself an adult and independent, but i find the thought of a real job in the real world with real bills scary. oh well. have a great day all.  much love. and if you are in cincinnati or near this area and want to hang out let me know because ill be here until sunday and i currently have no plans. peace and love"

"event","I have not updated in a while here are some of my thoughts and feelings about my life and how it is going or the lack of going in the case of this.

I have been in school now for about four or five weeks. ever since i got back i have not been motivated. i do the assigned work and i try to read as much as possible but my heart isnt into it. i wonder to myself what has changed. i think it is that i have been in school for 16 years now and im just tried of it. i feel restless and want to start my life. i look at everyone i used to hang out with from home and its like they have their lives together and i dont. i mean i have a total of 2100 dollars in my bank account and im 60 thousand dollars in debt. i live with my parents and i have no car. the money in my bank account is going fast and it seems i am always starting over from nothing. i dont see any improvements in my life. i am poor, carless and without degree. i know degrees take time which is why i am in school but it seems it is taking a lifetime. im told to not rush things because soon i will be 50 and asking what happened to the time, but i feel it is taking forever. i just want to start life! so on a realistic note, since i am a jr. i will keep going to school and graduate next year. the question is why?? what will this degree get me. it seems a BA is pointless. look at dan for instance, he has a BA and works two jobs and always tired. so i guess this means i have to keep going to school so that i can make something of myself and do what i want to do. which brings me to my next question, what am i passionate about. what do i want to do? i have no idea. i am clueless. i feel i am not passionate about anything and that i am not good at anything. i feel sad and helpless and unintelligent compared to my peers that seem to have their lives together. Then we come to the daily work, i am non motivated yet i have a tons of things to do. they will all get done because i also have a compulsion of not being late and unprepared. the thing is why am i so unmotivated as it seems the peers i have here at school are motivated?? i am really that different? 
i have not yet talk about my love life. it seems to be going well. i love him and he loves me and we are happy. which is the one stable thing in my life. it is so weird that, that would be the one stable thing because all through growing up it is the only thing i have longed for and school came so simply. did my life really change that much in 3 years. that love is easily obtained but school is hard for me. i have gotten more attractive and untelligent at the same time. is there a correlation between the two? i would think not. i do not know what is happening in my life, and yet i feel i should go with the flow of things. get my assignments done on time and study for pointless test on material i dont know if i even care about and become thing great student, but in the end what does it get me? where is the benefit to all this work. when will it pay off. will i always be the poor kid with dreams that arent accomplished? i will have to think more on this subject. i hope that some day i get all my dreams and i have love as well. is it possible to have love and have dreams. or do you have to give one up to achieve the other. i would hope not because one day i hope to have a career i love and have a man to love. i hope that man will be the one im with. and i hope that one day i will figure out what career i want and what will be the easyist way to capture that dream.

HOLDEN is my soulmate, i wish he wasnt fictional, if he wasnt fictional i would so give him the time.  i would also go into the woods and live with him and do all the things he wanted to do.  god life would be so much easier if HOLDEN was real.  but then again he probably would want someone that kept all their kings in the back row and all.  but if you really want to know the truth i love gerald.  i try to convice myself i can get over him super quick, but i know thats a lie.  it took me a year to get over thomas and i only dated him for like 6 months.  but ive been with gerald almost 10 months and i love him to death.  i hope there is a good reason he isnt calling or texting me.  i worry too much. maybe i have anxiety which is causing all this insanity in my head.  maybe i should just get drunk and sleep until im calm again.  but maybe alcohol is not a good idea. actually i think i should probably not drink.  i dont know what to do.  i just want to get over this craziness. i just want to be normal again.  i want gerald to call me everynight and text me once or twice a day.  and i want to enjoy school and learning and most of all i want to have faith again....but what is there to have faith in. everyone leaves you and doesnt talk to you when you have opposite opinions.  and if there is a god why would he let me fall so far down.  and if there is a god then why do so many people reject him?  im done with this stupid journal entry. goodbye... why am i such a fucking cry baby! god i fucking hate that im so fucking emo and hate my life so fucking much. GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK THIS SHIT!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","ok so i am just going to ramble. nothing is really going on with me but i havent written in this thing in forever.  so i have two weeks, well actually less then that left for the semester.  which means summer break is like a little over a month a way.  i am quite excited about this.  i miss my boyfriend and making money.  i love money and i need some badly.  anyway, i think i am going insane, i think i have written about this before, but here we go again.  so i dont know if live is just a dream or reality.  i think alcohol does this to me, it is after a heavy day or night of drinking i start thinking like this, but it always last longer then i wish it would.  its been 3 days now and i dont know what is going on.  i think i get assignments done and do things and i guess thats good, but then i doubt i did them.  that is the problem i do things and the next day or even later in the day i have to wonder if i really did those things or was it all in my head.  it kind of scares me that i cant get a grasp on reality.  anyway lets change the subject, ok so i love gerald and i cant wait to see him. we have been together almost 10 months.  that is crazy.  i really hope he is the one because it would be a waste of time if he wasnt.  well not realy a waste of time, but i dont know.  sorry for the pointless ramble but i have nothing else to write about so i am writing whatever comes to mind.  be glad you dont live in my mind or you would be insane as well.  see ya much love. ps. ill be home april 18 or 20 to the 29th.  much love."

"event","i have a lot of fears and recently they all have come together.  i am afraid of change.  i have anxiety when it comes to change.  i dont like change, when i started high school i freaked out and then it become ok. i never had a real boyfriend until my senior year and once i did when it was over i freaked out, i would say i loved thomas but i think i was more upset when it was over because it was a change in my life.  then i went off to college, and i didnt leave my room the whole first day.  i was scared of making new friends and the new life i was about to begin. but now hanover is like a second home but only because of the friends i have made.  i eventually got my license and started driving, i used all my money on a car that is no longer with me.  so this is another change i face, im poor and my bank account is sad.  i have a love in my life and that i hope doesnt change but it scares me to think it could.  this brings me to my next fear being alone.  humans are not meant to be alone which is why i have problems when my friends abandon me.  i have gone through a lot of best friends in the past 2 years and its sad.  i miss two of them very much but one i see more then the other.  they both have a lot going on and we have drifted away from each other. now i have a new best friend at home and one here at school.  the one here at school it seems is started to drift as the other ones did.  the one at home seems ok. she is always there, but if she was to get a new job then i doubt she would be there.  then we look at next year, everyone i hang out with will be going away, going aboard to study, even the for mentioned best friend.  i will miss them all, but i do not want to sit here and rot when they all are gone.  i dont know what to do i am scared to transfer because that is a big change, but i am also scared to be alone.  at home i have people that want me there.  gerald wants me, cyndi wants me to come home and maybe even get an apartment together.  then i think my friends at school will only be gone 4 months.  i dont know what to do.  im scared.  im afraid.  i have fears.  i think they are natural, but they are ripping me to shreds.  i miss my old friends and i will miss my new ones.  i guess its true people come in and out of your life.  but i wish they would stay, because i hate being the only one that doesnt change!"

"event","so lately ive been really down.  im thinking of running away from everyone i care about, because lately its like they dont care about me why should i care about me.  i have been having urges i hate having lately, but ive been trying to ignore them.  why is my life so complicated??  one of these days im going to do something that i will really regret, but hopefully not.  i dont know why im so depressed.. i was really happy but now all i can think about is sleeping and hopefully never waking up.  i just want to be done with college and start my life.  i dont want to be a teen anymore.  i dont want to be depressed anymore.  i want a happy life... but it seems that i have nobody anymore... its like my life is going down hill and i should have expected this because of how great it had been going.. im not meant for happiness.  im not meant for happiness probably because life is full of suffering and somewhere down the road someone thought it would be funny if my life was full of suffering.  i just dont want to be here anymore!  only 4 days of regular school left and then 3 exams.  i hope to be home thursday of next week.  taking a break is good.  i probably just sit at home by myself and die... that sounds good.  on another note i decided what religion i believe... i believe in buddha's teaches but i dont believe he was a god, nor do i believe in reincarnation.  i believe when someone dies they become nature... therefore i will follow the peaceful teaches of buddha, who only became enlightened because of the suffering in the world.. so maybe i have to go through suffering to become enlightened.  and i will also study taoism because they believe your fate in life is to become one with nature and i believe that fate is accomblished when you die.  i am not going to off myself so dont worry for those who are reading this (if anyone is).  im just down and this happens a lot during holidays because i get with my family and their goal is to make fun of me until i cry i think.  i am like the joke of the family and i dont know why?? but since thanksgiving i have been down and i dont know how to get back up. its like everyone and everything i have ever cared about is gone and i dont know how to get them or it back.  oh well life goes on and i must stay strong to say in this life.  well im done complaining about myself there are people in the world that have it worse off then me... that is why i usually hide my depression but for some reason i hate to write about it.  sorry to bore all of you... if anyone is actually reading this.  oh well be home soon, cant wait.  bye"

"event","so, my weekend was fun... on friday night i went over to young house (a theme house, it looks like a real house not a dorm).  Anyway the reason i went there was to learn to knit, well that didnt work out too well.  I suck at ""women's work"", oh well.  then people that lived there started bring other people in and they all had alcohol that was fun.  so larissa and I decided that we wanted to go eat and then get drunk.  so we went to the shoebox and ate with kari and aastik and then we all went back to young house.  That was a good time.  i didnt get too drunk but i was in a good mood kind of drunk.  The saturday all of us went to brunch at 1130, and i had to work at 1215.  i went to work, josiah is really doing well with his therapy, i love giving therapy, im happy im a psych major, even though i like philosophy a lot also.  so, after work i lyed around for a while and watch elf.  then kari and i went to dinner.  she called it a date and wanted to be the guy lol.  it really was just having fun.  then i decided i didnt want to wait anymore so we moved all my stuff down here.  so my new room is 213 and new number is x7529. im happy to be kari's roommate we get alone well.  so after i moved in larissa came over and we all started getting ready for lambda's 80s party.  that was a good time.  we went to walmart go someone to buy us alcohol, i still believe the US should catch up with the times and make the drinking age 18.  look at french, germany and like all of europe there drinking age is like 16.  oh well.  so we came back to my room had a few drinks and headed to lambda.  Lambda was a good time, except can you believe this... they had rap music instead of 80s.  i was kind of pissed.  you dont have a 80s party and play rap music, you play 80s music.  oh well.  so all and all it was a fun weekend, but on this sunday i will be doing school work and possibly going to church if larissa feels ok.  well ill update again sometime.  see ya all.

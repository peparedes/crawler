"event","Woohooo I am on another vacation!  This time around I won't have to work on household items that require manual labour.  I am actually planning on taking a trip to London and then with some friends from London going to Canada's Wonderland.  I haven't been to Wonderland since I was 11 holy cow I can't even count how many years that has been.  Summer is going pretty good relaxing out in the sun is the best, done that today.  Sitting in the sun reminds me of Cuba, ah Cuba it has been a while since I have went away somewhere nice or outside of canada.  Maybe during my vaction time next month lol I have three weeks to fulfill for the year 2004.  

Drove out to Harrow today with a friend to check out the sites......well didn't see much but it was a nice drive.  Well I am off to go rollerblading catch ya'll on the flip side.  Sorry I haven't been updating as often as I wish but my computer in my room is still not internet functioning.  Until then Keep the Peace."

"event","How can the cable company make appointments and say between 8am-4pm?  I find that pretty rude if you ask me!  And still I wait in the name of more than one station on my television.
I have been on my vacation now for exactly one week, oh how I needed this time off.  I have come to realize I like to garden, funny how I always said I would never garden and how I made fun of dad all the time.  I spent 40.00 yesterday on dirt, flowers, and yup cow manure.  I was having a hard time picking between cow poop or sheep poop when mom pointed out the obvious for me in the most simplest of terms.  She said, ""Cris, shit is shit!""  Lol had myself a good laugh at that one.  I am to plant my flowers today yippeee (as I wait for the cable guy!)"

"event","Well I have been pretty busy since I move back home, you know getting my shit together and all.  haha!  Things are going cool I moved into the house a couple weeks ago with a few renovations and porch painting sessions still on my list.  Fourteen minutes ago I started my 14 day vacation wooo hooo!  It has been exactly one year since I took any time off to that extent. 

So how are things>>>> Going good.  Job is good, life is good just trying to save some moola oola but that can be challenging when there is so much to do here at the house, Paint, blinds, decorating, and the list goes on.  I havent' really seen anyone since I have been back maybe a couple ppl but Ihave been working a lot of afternoons which inhibits my social life. My family is doing good seems a bit better since I am back (maybe just cause they are not worried about me)

I miss my pals in London, Oh shit I still owe money for that overdue book at the public library.  DO you think they will send the troops after me?  I hope not!  Well I am off to shower and relax and enjoy this long awaited vacation........call me if you wanna hang my peeps!!

"event","Wow that was some journey!  I have officially become a windsorite again.  Oh how I have missed it.  I have been home for just under 24 hours now and it feels right.  I realized on my way home last night why I had to move to London, and it feels good knowing that I made it through everything there (especially the winter).  I am currently living with my parents until the house is ready for us to move in.  Things are so much better now since I want to be here. I don't have to run anymore, windsor is the shit!
Now I just look forward to getting my stuff unpacked again.  I am going to enjoy this summer I can feel it.  Funny how much familiarity with things can put your mind at ease.  Now I just need to plan for that vacation mmmmmmmm.........(I will dream until then)
I felt so sad to leave my krew behind, they were the greatest employees ever.  They  put on such a shindig for me too. Complete with banners, presents, cake, and beer umh I mean no beer lol.  The overagers and managers took me out last Friday and got me slammed. That was a great time!  Fun shit!  All in all I will miss them dearly.  I guess things and life goes on but they were so sad they made me a card that had about 100 people sign it yearbook style.  Oh and Ryan got me some Canadian club...what a fucker!  Tata off to have a drink. (Of tea)"

"event","Well my apartment has been in shambles for about a week now and I cannot stand it!  My momma cat knows we are moving, she is moping around all sad, she knows the move comes with the stress of two new cats for a month. 
Been working the 4am shift the last two days.....wow, I cannot go to bed early!  So, I only get three hours of sleep a night and that sucks. 
Only 5 days till the big move (again)! I am going to disconnect my computer on Monday so I might not be around for a week or so.  

would anyone honestly rent a skidoo and use it on the Detroit River?  Hmmm????"

"event","Well it is 11am on thursday and I am tired tired tired.  Moving all my belongings in one week, I hope it is a nice day like today to move!  I am pooped just tired of trying to get things organized for the move home.  Between working and cleaning and packing I pretty much only have time to watch the hockey games......(GO LEAFS!)  

The funny thing about packing is you realize how much junk you accumulate in such a short period of time. I mean really am I gonna need that paper I worked on in grade 11?!  Still I cannot seem to allow myself to toss it.  Maybe it was the hard work that was put into it that holds a sentimental note in my brain or maybe I am just a packrat.  speaking of rats...last night a squirrel ran across my balcony with what I thought was a rat in its mouth..ewww but then three min later it ran across again with another in its mouth...then another so I had to get up and look at this point.  It was a mommy squirrel in baby transport she was running across my balcony to the floor below.  It was cute!  No, I will not run home with my kitty's in my mouth.  MMM fur in my mouth how pleasant.

Well my venture continues today as I have to hopefully finish packing and cleaning... I will never finish packing.. it will never end ahahhhhhhhhhhh!

Cant wait to take a vacation!"

"event","Well I know everytime I start writing journals I give up on them after the first week...why you may ask?  Well it is due to my personality complex of being an over achiever..haha  Really I just forget and plus I know no one but me is reading them.

Good news on the homefront I am coming home.  I am so happy, I will be working at the KK in windsor once again.  Back with my original krew and I know I will love it. (not that I do not enjoy the krew here they are amazing honest if I could steal them I would).  So no more fresh air london and hello deisel haze of windsor.  

I have finally gotten myself a life plan.  Get my shit in order and get some knowledge in this underused grey matter of mine!  Funny it has only been 5 years since Ihave been out of university and I miss it soo much!  Honest, for those with kids or who are in university themselves trust me when I say you will miss it.

So, I am happy to announce my arrival on May 3.  If there is anyone who wants to help me move (thanks but I know no one reads this) hahaah

See ya in 16 days........"

"event","I picked up a book on Chicken soup for the soul today and started reading the first few paragraphs.  Now, did this enlighten my soul?  Not really I think I have enough of my own problems to read about others  and their enlightening or dramatic life events.  I say the minimal amount of drama right now the better!  

Been feeling kinda tired lately, I think it is because I am in need of a vacation.....ah the flight, the people, the weather, the time away, and what is stopping me THE MONEY!  Ugh, I wish I could just spend the way I did 3-4 years ago!  I would not have 3 weeks of vacation waiting for me to take it if that were the case.  ( But now that I brought it up, it is the way I spent that has gotten me in this position...hmmm lol)

Things on the homefront (aka work) have been not too bad since I made a pack to be carefree *not careless*  I have come to the realization that in my work I take things very personally. huh, anyone remember my crying allll the time at Harv's? Them's Those were the Day's 

I am coming home this weekend and I am looking forward to it. I miss everyone like mad and this way I get to spend time at home with everyone on the holiday.

Off to make some Chicken soup.  Should this be special enough for my soul???? YOu decide!"

"event","It is April and we have gotten snow!  I could not believe the sight of it when I left for work this morn(which btw was at 3:30am)!  If I must say the rumour is true,London ontario does recieve its fair share of snow.  Everyday this winter consisted of leaving the house 1/2 hour early so I can clean off the car.  I cannot wait to see the warm sun of summer.  It is the one thing that will brighten the dull winter months that makes everyone a hermit.

I have been doing good with my stay positive attitude at work this past week.  I just realize it is extremely difficult when my fellow managers come to me and complain though.  I am trying to keep the mood up (and that is challenging) but I know I can do it, I feel better not letting things bug me too.  

I am going home this weekend...I am excited as always to head to my home town...ah I miss it sooo.  The skyline, the stench of diesel, the traffic, the condensed area, and mostly my friends and family.  

Well I slept today for a bit so now I am fully awake, gonna go for a drive to see the krew and a coffee (so I am addicted to coffee now too for those who didn't know)"

"event","It occured to me today on my way home from a long and stressful day of work,  if there are other life forms in our universe would they be  called aliens?  When you really think about it I may be an alien to other lifeforms so, why can I not consider myself an alien??  Ah, I do miss my philosophy classes from university.  It was there I was able to ponder the meaning of life and express it in a way that was acceptable (and got good grades for it too).   Now I am reduced to thinking about the mundane in order to push away the present....

There was this one time, I was standing on a boulder in the deserts of Nevada thinking who put this boulder here? Was it man? Was the omnipotent god?  Or did it just fall there damnnit?

I then had to deduce that it was likely the combination of all the above.  And now this conversation is putting me to sleep.  Sorry now that I wasted an entire 4 minutes typing that.  Oh no I will never get that time back either unless I secretly turn back the all the clocks that are within my arm range.  nah that would take another two minutes and those two minutes would only counter balance the 4 that I started with.  Anyhow, as everyone knows I am bored cause i work at 4am on Sundays and 8:30pm (saturday night0 is my bedtime.....so night night

So, today is my first journal, hmmm not bad not bad I think I am gonna like this journal program."

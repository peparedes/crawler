"event","I got a call the other day and asking me to if i wanted to go and do some work experince when i'd finshed univeristy for the summer (at the company i was orignally going to be doing it at).  I was very pleased until i realised that i may be doing work on another project with a carnival. However the power remains some what in my hands as i was offered the three weeks till the end of year to decided what i'd like to do. This was indeed a great turn of luck as recently is been alittle bit shit. i managed to burn one hand four in seperate places...which ismaking my  mask making hard as my hand is pretty sore... one burn is my own fault from when i was alittle tipsy as decided to burn a drinking straw, lucky jack stopped me from further injuring myself.

Had a pretty good thrusday night down the manor in bracknell, with lots of loevly curry and kopperburg...YUM! oh and the company wasn't bad either. Ended up meeting up with loads of old work mates that all seem to still be excatly the same which is nice. I think Hazel had fun meeting Jack and Toby and ...Marshall.... wearing a god damn awful kiss hat...he will never learn. 
One of my mates has just come out and she seems alot happier, though she does now seem alittle obessed with Pink. 

I've been feeding my gulity pleasure while i've been home and have been listening to all the McFly ablums... i think even my sister is sick of hearing them now hahahaha *evil laugh* but i won't ever get sick of them lol.

Well thats about all i can say to put off essay writing so sound go get on with it."

"event","Easter holidays i have concluded are too long but also not long enough. I have so much work to do that i could do with extra time, but at the same point i have far too much time in bracknell, and since my friends in sunny bracknell all seem to have new girlfriends, they are far too busy having sex! 

It's not all bad though i have nearly finished one of the three masks i had to make...its taken bloody ages though! not happy about that...oh and god i am sooooooooooo sick of sanding!!!!!

Parents decided to go crazy and paint the living room... two different shades of white.... what the point was i have nooooooo idea but they seem pleased with it.
Sister's spending all her time with her newly peg legged boyfriend jimmy... getting love bites and having pillow fights... *yuk*. 

i have managed to make the best of the nest that i call my room at bracknell....its funny, to shut the door in my room you have to stand with one foot on the bed and the other on the small foot space on the floor..lean back and close it...that is literally the amount of space i have...roll on summer! :)"

"event","those are not the words...its 'arms race'..i can not stress that enough. 

Costumes for the royal albert hall are coming along very slowly, finally got nick rayburn to admit he needed to order more paint...no mean feat i'm sure anyone whos met nick can tell you. (For the benifit of the non herts uni students nick rayburn is one of the many 'wonderful' tutors we have)....wonderful translates as 'alittle crazy but funny none the less'. 

Went to IKEA on saturday...which was long and very stressful. we had to wait 20 mins to get a parking space...unreasonable in my eyes...especially as i was very hungry.

i got to pretend i was a snow cow with some of my uni mates on thrusday. I decided to brave the snow and walk to uni, looked like a mad women giggling to myself. Was worth the loner style walk as i ended up having a short snowball fight with the thirds years...it was short because i can't throw and anna ran away! it was only me and rachel and i was more of a hindrence then a help to her. Proceeded to build a rather childish snowwomen...obviously with over sized breasts and a tiny head (the head kept falling off). 

well thats about as exciting as my week got....oh i got to watch 'dirty dancing' for the first time on sunday....truely a life changing film"

"event","well its been a fair while since i updated but thiswon't be long..i get bored of typing.

well i had a pretty cool birthday..apart from chipping my tooth on a glass when i was alittle bit worse for wear. Also ending up talking to random strangers about london theatre on the bus as they'd just come back from seeing the lion king. They loved my words of wisdom.

then the following week if was the shmoos birthday which was highly amusing. She had a black and white party and most the guests ended up with some kind of face paint on. We all ended up sat on the deckingin the freezing cold singing and smoking on shmoos houka pipe (thats not even how its spelt).

Then last tuesday saw hundred reasons at my uni was pretty cool ended up in the pit with hazel, anna and rachel with some lacross boys as our protection from the beating arms of the drunk first years. 

Next tuesday we are all going out for hazels 21 1/2 bday dressed as lego men for the retro night at the font...going to be good. 

As uni work goes it fairly good, currently making costumes for a performance at the royal albert hall...which is going well as  can be expected with the kind of designs we have been given. I tell its the first time i've known how to do anything on this course without being told..makes me feel very clever.

Well this was a fairly long entry for me"

"event","Came home rather suddenly tuesday had a mini break down like at college when i was DSM for Daves lot...you all remember it. Seems really silly now but it was good as my sister got to drive on the motorway for the first time and i got to see my cat :) 

It wasn't even just one thing or person...it was all over nothing really.... (really it was those trickies stairs that sent me over the edge), but like i said i got to come home and see my family which i feel i've neglected recently..or rather over the last year. I tend to do that...replace them with the boyfriends family. I suppose its easy to see fault in the people that have always been there for you. As most of you know my sister and dad don't get on too famously and my mums been phonng me concerned about his well being, wanting me in some way to make it better and sort things out between them... i now know thats impossible. It' been worrying me alot as the thought of losing my dad or him breaking down is the scariest thing to me and most real. So on top of the stress of uni work, not having a job, no money and serve spottage (again) i've been feeling alittle low recently.  

Blah ... enough with the explaining of boring emotions, basically i needed a break from everything  and coming home to see my cat has made me 100% calmer... every house should have a bald ginger crack whore cat.

Everyone seems to write really longs entries but i run out of things to say really quickly.....so i shall proceed to try and write some more things.

I got an email back from Weta to aid my research which was pretty cool as i didnt think anyone would actually reply. Gotta start setting up my work experience soon... going to see about maybe working at nimba creations...but first need to work how i'll get there and back.

As i don't have a lagre brown paper bag i shall become a hermit ashamed of its face. 

I'm fed up of having them. Nothing i have on my person is nice... i have bad roots from my attempt to cover my growming out blck bits...which in turn went an odd ginger, dodgy eyebrows cos i can't pluck for shit, teeth that dispite a brace have gone weird, shit skin oh and beileve it or not i don't like being this skinny!.........................................

Uni lifes bumming along alright now. Just getting into the throng of my new assignment, redesigning a computer game character and sculpting it. Should be good...but we shall see. 

As for my love life thats bumming along just fine too. Living with you boyfriend is sometimes the hardest thing in the world but most of the time its the best thing in the world. Boys smell sometimes to and how do you politly tell them they should really have a shower?

the best bit about not being a fresher is not having to live in halls. sure its good for the first couple of weeks..and sure its funny when the fire alarm gets sets off at 4 in the morning...but a year of that is just gay as shit.

the problem with not being a fresher is that this year our marks really matter if we want to get a good degree and go on to the 3rd year. oh and i have to queue for over an hour to get a council tax certficate :("

You fall in love quickly and easily. And very often.

You tend to take more than give in relationships.

You tend to get very attached when you're with someone. You want to see your love all the time.

You love your partner unconditionally and don't try to make them change.

You stay in love for a long time, even if you aren't loved back. When you fall, you fall hard.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howareyouinlovequiz/"">How Are You In Love?</a></div>"

Jess, Gayle and I were chosen for the best dressed people in the FOnt yesterday for the Hellsfire Ayslumn night. Twas fun hehehehe  all wore nurses outfit (of some description) and cover them in blooded hand prints..the best part is cos my one was pvc the hand prints wiped off at the end of the night lol. Zombified all our faces and gave yourselfs very big hair lol was AWESOME! 

Had a proper boggie and can safely say i danced to my fullest retardness. WAs also getting alitlle bum raped by the lanky emo guy at uni. It didn't matter how hard Jess or I pushed him back with our bums he just kept hitting me wih it, drunken fool. Only one bad point of the night i have got a brusied foot as there was a small mosh pit to one of the songs and i can safely say i was trooded on by some big fat fucker! 

So no hangover but a brusied foot. Could be worse could have both. To top the whole noght off Jess made me a lovely pizza and let me burrow the producers which i watched the first 5 mintues and last 5 lol."

ANd then start to question something very dear and important to you for no reason...or maybe there is a reason maybe not everythings as perfect as you first thought? 

Or maybe just being left in a house all day and having practically no sleep is making you think about things that really don't matter anymore.

had random drunk guys trying to dance with me which is scary when your sober, but mary saved me quite a few times. Had a little boogie with Craig but he's funny so that was cool. Gayle was a lesbian for the night which was wise as her ex boyfriend told me he still fancied the pants off her... nice awkward conversation. 

Helen had a dance off with a guy that had taken quite a shine to her and spet most of the night rubbing his bum on hers. 

The fun really began when i had to put gayle to bed. I'm very impressed she didnt fall down any stairs, if it had been me i would have spent the niht sleeping at the bottom of the stair well lol. Hope her heads okay as she smacked it quite hard against her bedroom wall.

all in all a very random night."

Oh su i have to present some work on the 9th (its only a interim), but hopefully i shall be coming down afterwards. Really depends on how much money i have. I will try though. Oh is it okay if luke comes if eh's not working?

And so to look cool for the fancy dress Luke and I decided to call round Jess flat to get zombiefied. Luke ends up wearing make up (which he seemed to enjoy, should i be worried?) i end up with huge back combed hair and blood running down my face and just to take the piss fake slashes by my wrist (fucking emo kids hehehe). Once Gayle, Jess, Luke and I are a suitably zombiefied we had up to spams to convince her that she wants to join in on the crazy make up fun (wasn't hard to convince her, she tired to resist but what was the point really we were going to put on her anyways). 

Once we picked up spam we head to Gayle's kitchen for pre night out drinks and cheap pizza. Here we transform spam into a crazy sally (nightmare b4 xmas style). When we get to the Font bar i manage to get separated from my mates and end up talking to sleazy dave who couldn't stop staring at my breasts (Quiet scary). 

Be the end of the night i end up breaking my wand in a pit and losing one of my favourite ear rings NOT IMPRESSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

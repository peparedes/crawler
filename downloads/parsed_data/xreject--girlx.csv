me happy happy

also, people! listen! if your kinda sad, or a little blue or someone/something has pissed you off then can you just say what it is, and if you want to talk about it thats even better but i hate knowing that people i love are upset and not having a clue why. you dont even have to go indepth on feelings and stuff but say something, anything."

"event","had great weekend, well apart from the working, but inbetween was awesome :)

even though life isnt as good as it could be im still really happy, wee things that would usually have me crying like a bitch dont bother me that much, and the only thing i was a little worried about has been resolved tonight (there must be a god)

arg took such a little drug craving in work but i new that what i wanted was impossible to get so i just went to the bar afterwards and had a coulple of drinks then home, jennas home with me too woop
sad that i cant get drunk cos im really in the mood today but happy im home to talk to my unkie daz

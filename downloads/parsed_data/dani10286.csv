"event","so basically i dont know why i decided to take summer classes because they SUCK!!!!!!!! my consumer behavior class i had a midterm (i got an 87 so it wasnt too bad) and now monday i have a 6-8 page paper and 7-8 minute presentation i have to do on the gay and lesbian subculture and their consumer behavior patterns like wtffffff! ive been procrastinating so its saturday and i only have 1/2 of it done and its due monday night... oh well... i just want this class to be over! and i have an english class and i have to do a 5-7 page paper on love and death from 3 stories and like how they compare and contrast...its so dumb! i didnt have any papers or presentations last semester...ahhhhhh its stressing me out! it is suppose to be summer and i should be at the beach but i am in my house working on this dumb thing!!! 

last night we went to devroe and went on the swings woooooo i love going there at night its so pretty and there were so many stars!!! hahahah i am such a geek! i wish harry was here because i would take him there and we could just get a blanket and cuddle and look at the stars and ocean hahahah wow im pretty gay, huh? oh well! :) 

speaking of harry... he seems to be doing good out there :) just working and hanging out...only a month a week until i go out there!!!! i am so excited!!!! hahahaha but its understandable... i havent seen him since march 18!!! wow that is like 3 months ago from today...it seems like forever though :( i need me some looloo hahahaha it hasnt been easy though...but now i know how it is to be in a long distance relationship...its all about trust big time...and that is a little bit hard for me, but he has never given me any reason to not trust him i just think waaaaaay too much i think...oh well im only human :)

cookout at my aunts today for fathers day... which basically means me, my bathing suit, a hot tub full of ice to make it cold hahaha, and some white russians NICEEEEEE :) 

party tonight, maybe? this could end up being very sketchy!!!!!"

"event","last week i took a week long class from 8:30-4:30 and then night class from 6:30-9:30... i have never been so worn out in my life... i will never EVER do that to myself again... i had a midterm on wednesday for the class, a final on friday, and i have a 5 page paper due on monday!!! i am so not in the mood to write it :( blahhhhhhhh its summer seriously! wtfffff! well i guess i have to do what i got to do in order to graduate in four years... 

and other than that nothing else is going on... sarahs 21 bday was on may 19th and we went into boston to fire and ice.. that was an adventure driving in there hahah we got lost going in and coming out but we made it home :) and now i dont really have anything to do...

im going insane from boredom!!! i hate massachusetts there is never anything good to do except drive around and eat and be fat seriously hahahah no wonder why this world is getting obese!!! thank god for TCBY hahaha that ice cream is wicked good! or should i say ""frozen yogurt""...i wish sarah and amanda lived close to hang out but its alright ill see them at least a couple times this summer! trips to hampton beach wooooo (and hopefully i get over my fear of driving the highway! i HAVE to stop with that! it is a hugeeee fear, but i need to overcome it!)

im starting to miss harry like crazy :( this whole situation sucks balls hahaha but no really it does... like i havent seen him since march 18!!!!!!!! wtfffff is that???!?!? seriously im going through withdrawals...i think being in love is like being addicted to a drug it is so weird...not like i count or anything hahaha but its like 2 months and a week and i still have 2 MORE MONTHS!!! it sucks when you have a boyfriend but you cant see them or cuddle with them or hold hands with them or just sleep with them... it is a very weird situation...it feels like im with him, but im not? i have no idea... and all it is is constant worry, like i hope hes not out with another girl or i hope hes happy out there and i hope i make him happy, its just a lot of questions floating around in my head that wont go away as hard as i try to not think about it... i guess its human nature to worry about the things you have no control over...i think im just afraid of getting my heart broken, as cliche as that sounds...but i cant live my days thinking like that! i need to take each day at a time and do things for myself that i enjoy and that i find rewarding... i cant sit and worry it will take too much of the life im suppose to be living away from me...i need to stay happy and focused and soon everything will fall into place"

he flew in on friday and we went out to eat and got chinese food :) it was so weird not having him around! but on the other hand it was good too because i got to see people i haven't seen in awhile :) and i didnt go out to eat so i lost some weight hahah

today is our one year anniversary! he just surprised me at work with two dozen roses! one set of red ones and one set of pink ones :) they are sooo nice!! and he met the people i work with and ate the rest of my mom's dube's chicken hahah 

tonight we're going into boston to vinny testas or just staying around here and going out to dinner..i cant believe its already a year!! i made him a scrapbook so he can have it to remember stuff and to take out to new mexico when he moves out there at the end of february..

it is definitly going to suck trying to keep together a long distance relationship...but if its meant to be then it will work out! hes making really good money down there already and is already looking for his own apartment or condo! im so proud of him for taking this opportunity :) 

i have classes everyday this semester which sucks....so i go into class 8:30-2:20 on mondays and tues/thurs 8:30-1:45...wed/fri i go in 8:30-10:20 and then work 11-5..not too bad...bus calc, macroeconomics, and financial acct are already kicking my butt...i havent had so much homework in college yet! this semester is going to kill me...oh well!

it was relaxing...we just hung out and went shopping and had some cookouts... we went to bill's parents house for new years eve and she cooked steak ( made chicken just for me because i hate steak hahah) and it was a nice meal...i kicked their butts in uno and we just had a good time :) me and harry went in their hot tub and just hung out...instead of saying happy new year at 12:00 out there we said it at 10:00 because when it was 10:00 out there it was really midnight at home :) 

harry was suppose to fly home with me on tuesday but he ended up staying in new mexico last minute to train for his new job out there...so i had to fly all the way home alone :( and there were delays in albuquerque and chicago! i got to the airport at 11am and didnt get home until midnight in boston!! 

thursday night i got pizza at little italy and watched sisterhood of the traveling pants with amanda! that was fun :) friday night sarah picked me up and i went to her house in amesbury and just hung out around her town...saturday i went to see memoirs of a geisha with jamie...that movie was really good!!! and sunday i just went to the gym and started making harry's scrapbook for our one year..

harry is suppose to fly home on friday but now he's saying he might not be home until february 1st??? :( i miss him alot...its going to stink next month when he actually moves there :(

but last night i bought tickets to go out there from march 11-march 18 during my spring break to go see him :) 

i hope this all works out between us... distance is a hard thing to work at :("

"event","went to the patriots vs. tampa bay game on the 17th!!! it was soooo much fun!! i won raffle tickets at my work christmas party and they were club seats!! soo obviously i took harry and he was so surprised!! when i won them at work i didnt call him and tell him i waited until he came to my house...and i laid out a set of directions to the stadium that said turn over on the other side and said the game time and place and he was sooo excited!! he just kept smiling and couldnt stop lol so the seats we had were in the red seat section in between the 20 and 30 yard line and we had a place to go inside too! and there were huge bars set up and leather couches and seats and bar tables and chairs and the bathrooms were soo nice like a rich hotel lol it was so much fun! we both bought patriots jerseys the night before and wore them :)

harrys parents left the 20th for new mexico so we've been going back and forth staying at my house some of the time and his house the other half of the times...brad's home from the army so him, sean, nicole and steve came over harrys one night and we just hung out.. and we went christmas shopping with jimmy!

harry stayed over christmas eve and we opened presents together in the morning :) it was so much fun having someone else to open presents with instead of just me my mom my dad and mistletoe lol harry got me one of those workout balls i wanted, northface boots (for when i have to walk to school in the snow lol), a pink northface jacket with matching hat, scarf, and gloves because he wants me to go skiing with him, a pink water bottle, bath and body works stuff, and a soft big white christmas teddy bear! then we spent the rest of the day eating lunch at my house, then we stopped at his grandmother and aunts house! it was fun :) larry stopped by with jay christmas night because we havent really seen him since he moved to boston in november! he seems to be doing pretty good :) 

we leave friday for new mexico again!! it should be fun...i might try skiing and go with him and bill to a resort in colorado! i hope i dont break any bones or anything lol

we're not breaking up, it's just going to be so hard not seeing him like i do now...

he's going out there for work...selling machines for food packaging companies, and he'll make a good salary plus commission off of all the machines he actually sells...but its still going to be hard..

ill go out to visit him for spring break in march...and then ill have school until probably almost july because im going to take a couple of summer courses so i can graduate faster and move out there with him...then maybe spend a month of summer out there?

ahh this is not going to be fun...

ill just keep myself busy with classes at the gym and maybe actually study, considering i decided to put business calculus, accounting, and macroeconomics all into one semester..good one danielle!

"event","new mexico was amazing!!! i can't believe i've been and im already back home!! kind of sucks being back here..but that's life i guess...

the first day we left at 1am to get the plane at 5:20...then we changed over in cincinnati and got to new mexico at 10am...me and katina went shopping and harry and bill went to work...then we went on this tramway up the mountains and had appetizers at the restaurant on top of the mountain...you could see the whole city from up there!! then we got dinner..i got chicken while everyone ate their huge steaks lol

thursday was thanksgiving...we went over around 2 so i spent the whole morning reading nicole ritchie's new book...i ended up finishing it before we left new mexico lol all about her life and drug problems...it was sort of interesting...thanksgiving was good..the usual turkey and mashed potatoes but she made sweet potato fluff with marshmellows ew and green bean caserole ew...i tried both by they were nasty...bill stuck the turkey neck in his pants and freaked me out because it really looked like his wang hahah..then bills sister jenny brought her mexican boyfriend for dinner, oh and she had to let us know he shot to people...awesome...he was like a 5'3 midget guy with fake gold jewelry everywhere...what a weirdo...then we went in their hot tub outside sooo nice! its like built into the concrete and stuff...so cool! 

friday me and katina went shopping..ahh the malls were ridiculously packed with people...but they had really good stores..they had a forever 21 down there and all stores like charlotte russe and h&m..when i move out there ill definitly have some good stores to shop at :) then we went to see bill's warehouse/office where harry's going to work in february :( i dont want him to leave but its REALLY good money out there..so whatever will benefit us in the future..they showed us the slums and we got lunch at some brazilian buffet...it was alright..they came around with meat on sticks and i tried fried bananas lol then we bought bill and katina a water bubbler thing for their house...then we just ordered pizza and called it a night!

saturday we went to breakfast(they served fruit with everything and it was healthy, no grease)..then we went to santa fe and shopped around...it reminded me of a newburyport or a rockport with stores lined up on the streets and basically tourist attractions...like some weird staircase in a church we saw that shouldnt be able to hold weight on it but people can walk on it...i got my mom some turquoise earrings and my dad a dreamcatcher thingy...then bills parents took us out to dinner..his mom was drunk so it was a good time lol

sunday we went to breakfast in some ghetto place and bums were walking in and asking for money...it was a little weird...and then we went shopping in old town albuquerque...kinda a smaller version of santa fe but it was still fun to walk around...i got a cold stone cake batter ice cream :) love it! and then for dinner we went to olive garden because we love it there and plus theres none around here!

and then monday we just woke up, went to the only dunks in the city (by the way, they didnt have ice for ice coffee AND you had to put your own cream and sugar in the coffee!!!) starbucks was everywhere instead of dunks...and then we had the plane at 9am and got home around 7pm..long day!!

but it was soooo much fun! they had chick-fil-a drive thru's, panda express drive thru (chinese food ew), whataburger drive thrus haha, carl's jr drive thru, and best of all they had SONIC everywhere!!! all the roads are like highways and mountains are everywhere! its so pretty :) the houses are all stucco and one story and the mansions there are gorgeous!

we met bill's aunt and uncle and they have not just one house, but FOUR HOUSES!! they even have one in vail,colorado where all the famous people go to go skiing!! AND they have live in maids, cooks, and gardeners!!! thats so crazy!

well thats the trip and ill be going back there in march and probably spending the whole summer out there since harry's moving there in february!i can't wait :)"

on the other hand...my dad is in salem hospital right now because he has cellulitis..its a leg infection..he can't really walk because his leg is swollen and painful..he was suppose to be coming out today but they're keeping him in even longer now...he probably will still be in there for thanksgiving :( i feel bad leaving my mom home, but she told me to go to new mexico with harry..if it worsens up before tomorrow night i will definitley be cancelling my plane tickets...

i saw harry potter yesterday with harry...it was really good!! but for some reason i thought the prisoner of azkaban was scarier than this one! those dementors are definitly freaky looking!

i hope these new mexico people serve turkey on thanksgiving and like mashed potatoes... there is no way im eating like pigs feet or whatever crazy food they eat out there...ill be eating bread and butter if thats the case 

harry's christmas list:
-buddha statue
-scented matches
-GNC gift card
-american eagle jacket
-swiss army watch
(yeah he doesn't read this thing)

im going to get him some shirts and that's probably about it...maybe a movie too?? family guy dvd's!! hahah stewie is awesome!

the malls are so crazy already! why is christmas such a stressful hectic holiday??? 

i got my mom an annalee doll for christmas :) she loves those things and i got it from the real store in new hampshire! i dont know what to get my dad yet..probably just something sports related..

ill get harry's parents a restaurant gift certificate...probably to capone's because that's where us 6 usually get dinner when we all meet up :) 

my mom always makes my nana a calendar with my huge face on it...really who wants to stare at my face for a WHOLE YEAR??? haha i have no idea!!!

i cant believe its already halfway through november and first semester of sophmore year is almost over!! soo weird!!

i went to danvers high with sam last night because fenwick was suppose to compete in the cheering competition but they didnt send in papers in time? so they couldnt? but it was still fun...we went to applebees too mmmm!!!

on another note...harry might have to move down to new mexico for a couple of months because hes going to start working for katinas boyfriend bill selling like packaging machines (bill makes a shitload of money doing that)...bill even made him business cards already!!.. but that wont be until like february-march... but still its going to suck pretty much..and obviously i cant just up and leave and go down there with him?? i have to finish school and theres nooooo way neen will let me move out there until im done with school...which is still 2 more years..

we're going down to new mexico in two weeks for thanksgiving.. hes going to go to the plant bill works at and learn stuff then, and we're probably going to go to santa fe and alburquerque (or however you spell it lol)it should be fun..but we need to stop in cinncinnatti ohio and then take another plane to new mexico which will be a pain in the butt but i guess it will be alright...and we're flying out of manchester,nh airport?? 5am in the morning too!! hmm this should be interesting..."

ended up going to bed really early and waking up really early the next day... we met up with diana and artie and all of them and went to this apple picking farm... it was raining so we just bought apples that were already packaged...and got some cider and apple donuts MMMMM...then we headed over to the annalee shop and some furniture store...everyone was hungry (like usual) so we went to hart's turkey farm..sooo good!!! i ended up falling asleep at 7 that night lol

monday charlie made breakfast and then we drove up to harrys uncles house who lives near salem, new hampshire... his grandmother made us soup and we just all sat around and talked.. i played barbies and polly pocket with his little girl cousins hahah it was fun though!!!

i had a midterm in marketing tuesday and a quiz in law... ewww but i think i did ok... and tuesday night we went to angelica's for katina's 25th birthday... it was fun! cindy's whole side was there and sam went so it was fun!

were going up new hampshire tonight after the gym... it should be a good weekend! if there is no drama...because whenever we go up there it always seems like their is constant drama...and not even just with the kids its the adults mostly! but we'll probably go to the friedburg fair, shop at some outlets (i need some new jeans/black pants!!) and get dinner at the best restaurant in the world...OLIVE GARDEN!!!! mmmmmm love it!!

friday i got my hair done...instead of getting lowlights i decided on lighter highlights because im too pale to get dark hair...it just wouldnt look right..then friday night me, harry, sarah, and ruth went to the cheesecake factory...their bf's had to work and sam went up camp so it was just us 4...it was fun though :) we just talked and laughed and watched the red sox game...then at the end the people sang happy birthday and wrote it in chocolate on my cheesecake plate mmm hahah harry got me a watch, some body lotion stuff, and a victoria secret gift card haha sarah got me a victoria secret gift card too!! after that, me harry and sarah went to harry's friend bills house and saw brad, sean, nicole, jimmy, and steve...that was fun :) amanda gave me a nice bday call at 12:30 hahah thanks amanda! hope those embry-riddle pilots are treating you good! :)

saturday i worked til 12:30 and then went to golds with harry...after that we went to brad's house for his birthday slash going-away-to-the-army party...we ended up at this kid blodgett's house and just hung out...met some nice people and sat around a little bonfire thing...we should do this more often!

sunday harry woke me up early and took me to marias for breakfast...then we headed to burlington mall so i could waste my birthday money on clothes..figures i dont buy any clothes haha i got a purse from aldo (its bronze or copper?) and has sequin things on it..and then i got this lip gloss at sephora and bad gal eyeliner from filenes..then we met up with my parents and his parents at rainforest cafe mmm i got sang to again (ew i hate that its so embarrasing...then we went to the hospital because harry's cousin david's gf sarah had her baby boy :) he is the cutest baby i have ever seen! i held him for like a half an hour and he just laid there sound asleep!!! sooo cute!

2 weather and climate tests this week...ahhh shoot me! one is for the actual class and the other one is for the lab...i hope their easy!

katina and bill come up from new mexico on thursday...i cant wait! it should be fun! i havent seen her basically since april..we're going up new hampshire next weekend for the holiday and we're going to the friedburg fair and apple picking and all that fun fall stuff :) i hope the leaves are all changing colors up there!! we'll probably spend a day in boston and go to the wrentham outlets to go shopping! woooo! they leave october 16 so it should be a good time :) and then me and harry go to new mexico to see them for thanksgiving and we get to see their new house!!

"event","ok so this week went by kinda fast...thank god!

i had a law test (did probably really bad..) and then i had a communications and a weather & climate quiz...which hopefully made up for my law grade...

went to the mall wednesday night with sarah again lol i got a pink purse from the gap and it has cute red cherries in it! i love it! and i got a pink cordoroy skirt from american eagle and a white tank top thats tight on top then flows out kind of...only $6 for the tank!! and the skirt was on sale too! haha bargain shopping is key

other than that school is good :) one person is bugging me ALOT and i just want to punch her in the face, but theres nothing i can really do about that...maybe someone else can punch her in the face for me :)

tonight is cheesecake factory MMMMMMM :) sooo good! 19 finallyy! i think its just going to end up being me, harry, sarah, ruth, chris, and larry...this birthday needs to jump 2 years ahead sooo i can be 21 and actually go out with harry and his other friends to bars and just have a good time...

im also getting my hair done today at 11:30! im kinda nervous, because 1.) im getting lowlights instead of highlights, kind of a chestnut auburn color and 2.) im going to try and go for the long side swept bang kind of look. it better come out good!!! if not then....that will just suck and i will never get a haircut on my birthday ever again...

i love my lulu and its going to be 8 months monday awwww <3 he makes me smile alot :)"

classes seemed like they lasted forever this week, and i felt like i was rushing around everywhere all the time...

stupid bookstore sent me the wrong book which i was suppose to get ""the next business day"" but didnt get it until 2 weeks later...stupid people who work there..they send the book late AND its wrong...what is so hard about working at a BOOKSTORE?!? 

other then that...school is alright...my ethics teacher is a nutcase who never stays on track and seems like hes always speaking a different language..my weather & climate teacher is bald on the top of his head but has brown hair around the sides and back? what a goofball..and he wears his pants up to his belly button...my marketing teacher is boring but we get to watch movies :) one had a janet jackson music video in it hahah my law teacher is pretty easy, shes young and she outlines so you never have to take notes YESSSS...my lab teacher is pretty easy, and my communications class is fun because we listen to music and talk about nothing :)

wednesday night i went to the mall with sarah and ruth...got some khakis at american eagle :) i dont know why, but im just sick of jeans so i decided on a good old pair of khakis..we saw nikki at express! and then we went home...

next friday night cheesecake factory at burlington mall!! soo excited :) finally 19!! one more year til the 20's! thats sooo weird! but cool too i guess!! 

on another note... neen is a bitch... she has been and always will be one :)"

i went to sarah and ruth's apt last week...its soooo nice! i wish i could move out of my house... but id rather save my money for later on i guess...the apt's kind of remind me of the mass art dorms but they are bigger, since 7 people live in one apt...

went to jj's apt in boston yesterday with harry and larry...its right next to northeastern (where he goes) and emmanuel...its pretty nice, but not worth $650 a month with 7 people living in it! they have a cute little black puppy and it fell asleep next to me! we just watched some of the football games and met his roomates and then went home...

and then we left there and went to harry's friend rich's house down the street from his house and he had a big going away party because he left for iraq sunday morning.. saw some random people that used to go to fenwick and some peabody people i had met before...sarah and kyle stayed for a little while but then they left..

tuesday i was driving to his house and so im driving right near bonkers and this jerk pulls out of there wicked fast through double lanes even though there was on coming traffic..so this guy pulls halfway out into the right lane and the kid on the left of me went around him and the guy got so pissed...he backed his suv up so fast and sped up to the kids bronco stopped at the red light..the guy jumps out of his car and starts beating the kid in the passenger side..no joke..so the kids sped off and it was crazy.. that is definitly the craziest thing of road rage i have ever seen in my life

"event","went to new hampshire from thursday thru monday..

thursday we left at like 8:00 so we missed all the traffic..we stopped at wendy's eww...then we went to harry's grandparents camp..we fell asleep on the couch watching the news at like 11

friday we just hung out.. we set our tent up outside and blew the air mattress up..but then harry didnt feel good so he took like a 3 hour nap while i watched some maury and some makeover shows..fun time..then we went on an adventure to try and find olive garden because we wanted some really good italian food..soo we got lost and went a 1/2 hour in the opposite direction but then we finally found it and it was amazing :) then sam and everyone was up camp when we got back so we just sat around the fire and toasted some marshmallows mmm...

saturday we took the jet ski out and were on that for basically the entire day..and we layed on the water trampoline..i got so burnt even my lips got burnt which was weird but its ok now i have some color :) at night we went to weirs beach and harry had the tattoo guy draw up this tattoo he wants to get on his left arm or his calf, idk which one yet..and we took pictures in the photo booth, ate some ice cream..we were gonna go see war of the worlds in the drive-in but noone else wanted to so we went back to the camp and had another campfire..

sunday harry cooked me breakfast :) then we spent the day having a cookout at sam's camp and went on the jet skis again..and then all the kids took the pontoon boat out and we went to the rope swing and just swam around and goofed off for awhile..at night sam's dad, harry, and dennis lit off fireworks in the backyard of their camp..they were so good :) better then the ones they were doing on the actual lake..boats were stopping by and honking their horns because they were so good hahah it was fun...

monday we went to sam's camp and they cooked a hugeeee breakfast...there was probably 20 people up there..it was nuts..then we took the jet ski for a last time run and took it out of the water, packed up, and left.. we made it back in a record hour and a half..no traffic at all..then we stopped at harry's house to change, and we went to see war of the worlds..it was alright, kinda reminded me of signs..then i finally got home at 9:00

last night we ate at monte's...sooo good :)

tonight im going shopping!! yessss finally!! i need some new clothes :)"

"event","There may be days when you get up in the morning and things aren't the way you had hoped they would be. That's when you have to tell yourself that things will get better. There are times when people disappoint you and let you down, but those are the times when you must remind yourself to trust your own judgements and opinions, and to keep your life focused on believing in yourself and all that you are capable of. There will be challenges to face and changes to make in your life, and it is up to you to accept them. Constantly keep yourself headed in the right direction for you. It may not be easy at times, but in those times of struggle you will find a stronger sense of who you are, and you will also see yourself developing into the person yoy have always wanted to be. Life is a journey through time, filled with many choices; each of us will experience life in our own special way. So when the days come that are filled with frustration and unexpected responsibilities, remember to believe in yourself and all that you want your life to be, because the challenges and changes will only help you to find the dreams that you know are meant to come true for you."

we left friday night around 7ish and got up to the camp at 8:30..we set up the tents (sam's tent went up really easily because they had a new tent..but me and harry struggled with my aunt's like 1970's tent..but we eventually got it standing up). we just had a campfire...cooked some hot dogs and hamburgers on the little grill and just hung out..on saturday we went to the beach..we left around 9 and drove down and walked through all the little stores and we all ended up getting a henna tatoo, which took like 2 hours because there were six of us (me harry sam jack dennis and jess). as much as i wanted to go lay on the beach, we didn't. we ended up back at the camp because it was soo hott and we made lunch and then went swimming in the pools at the campsite. later on we went back down the beach and took a trolley. me and harry got a caricature done of us on a sailboat hahah its funny...then we got some food and walked back to the camp. it was still like 90 degrees out at 8 o'clock so we all went swimming again and hungout in the jacuzzi. we ended up going to bed at like 11 and waking up at 8 to leave on sunday morning. we stopped in a little breakfast place in saco,maine and we were on our way.

sunday me and harry just hungout and watched spiderman 2...then we went to his house went swimming..went to dick's to try and find a better tent so we can bring it the next time we go camping.. and then we had to go to sam's house for their cousin david's 21st birthday..it was fun everyone was getting thrown in the pool..harry picked this kid capano up (who basically pounced on me up at sam's camp last summer..eww) and threw him in the water...it was funny :) 

next weekend we're going up to the camp in barnstead,nh..that should be fun :) thursday night until monday night...harry's friend larry might come up saturday and sunday night but that should be fun he's cool to hang out with..sam's dad is going to light fireworks and their going to have a hugeee cookout so it should be fun :) my mom and dad might come up for the day, but i doubt it because my moms retarded. 

maybe i should do some work..."

no song that i could sing but i could try for your heart
our dreams they are made out of real things
like a shoebox, a photograph, a sepia tone lovin

love is the answer there is for most of the question of my heart
like why are we here and where do we go and how come it's so hard
it's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
i'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're together

mmh it's always better when we're together
yeah we'll look at the stars when we're together
well it's always better when we're together
yeah it's always better when we're together

and all of these moments just might find a way into my dreams tonight
but i know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings
it brings new things for tomorrow night you see
that they'll be gone too, too many things i have to do
but if all of those dreams might find a way into my day to day scene
i'd be under the impression i was somewhere in between
with only two, just me and you, not so many things we got to do or places we got to be
we sit beneath the mango tree now

yeah it's always better when we're together
somewhere in between together
yeah it's always better when we're together
yeah it's always better when we're together

i believe in memories
they look so pretty when i sleep
and when i wake up you look so pretty sleeping next to me
but there is not enough time
there is no.. no song i could sing
there is no combination of words i could say
but i will still tell you one thing

we're better together <3"

"event","I am preparing for what will most likely be the greatest experience of my life.
In 29 days I will embark on a journey that I never thought possible-seven weeks in Europe with the love of my life...I have never been so excited about anything in my life and every day it gets closer, the more impatient I get.  I may never come back.
On July 5th at 9:35p.m. we leave on a non-stop BA flight to London were we will spend five days.  From there we will a short flight to Paris were we will spend five days and take side trips to Normandy and Versailles.  Then we will take a night train from Paris to Milan and spend a week with Jim's family and our friends Lorenzo and Daniella (who we met last summer) In the small town of Mercalo, a small town in Northern Italy between Como and Milan.  After a relaxing week and more food and wine than we will be able to handle, we will spend two nights in the senic Cinque Terre in the town of Vernazza where I will celebrate my 21st birthday.  Then we will spend four days in Rome seeing all the beautiful historical sights I've ever wanted to see.  From Rome we will go to Vienna where we will spend two nights and then it is on to Muich, Germany and drink in many a beer hall, then to Amsterdam (for the sights AND the coffe shops) and then will spend a relaxing to weeks in the beautiful city of Bergen, Norway.
This trip is a dream come true."

"event","I've always told myself never to regret any of my choices, that everything happens for a reason and life will eventually unfold the way its supposed to, but there are things that I can't help regretting right now. I dropped out of college last year before the first semester even ended- granted I was bloody miserable- but I still feel like an ass for doing it. I know I was wasting money and I didn't even know what I wanted to do, but who does that? My only conselation is that I've had alot of time to find myself and realize what I want to do with myself, well I figured out what I want to do with my life, but I still haven't ""found myself"". If it's even possible I think I've lost myself. I feel like I know myself even less than I did before and that's just plain frightening.

I'm lost.

So many things are running through my head all the time that I can't even keep my thoughts straight. And there is a certain someone that I can't get off my mind even though they shouldn't be in my thoughts at all. Hell, I don't even know who I am anymore.

Next week I'm scheduled to work 36 hours (8 of which are sunday- Time& 1/2!) which will make up for my completely uneventful life. I'm 19 years old- shouldn't I be getting into trouble and having fun and shit? Maybe I got it wrong.
So for now, I'll just sit and listen to my launchcast station featuring: dashboard confessional, bush, the eagles, jimi hendrix, incubus, the get up kids, the starting line, elton john, third eye blind, queen, barenaked ladies, tom petty, the grateful dead, smashing pumpkins and more!

"event","Well, I passed the pre-employment drug test to work at Khol's HOORAY! I didn't smoke for a month before I took it so I was pretty sure I was gonna pass but I was still worried about it. Last night I smoked for the first time since 7/27 I was high as fuck after like 1/4 of a peach phillie smoked with Nikki and Paul Sales. GT's.
Everyone is going back to school, which makes me sad but I'll be working anyway and have more time to learn to drive :-) I also have to fill out applicationsfor nursing schools (BC, Fairfield, University of So. Florida and University of San Francisco) I REALLY hope I get into BC but I can go to all 2 out of the 3 others for free 2. Thanks for working at BC Dad! I'm super wicked bored and I wanna go get high."

"event","Wow, what an AWESOME time! Band Camp 04 was the best so far! There were 21 counselors: Me, Nikki, Stacey, KateWatt, Foye, Megan Donnoly, Megan Shnelle, KateMcLean, Christine Dizuba, KaitMac, Elana DeFonte, Ski, Myles, JoeMac, Mark Lessard, Mark O'Connor, BJ, Matt Giblin, Colin Chambers, TM and Dave Hunter and we all got along great (with the exception of a couple incidences) and it was such a great week, especially the last night when we all satyed in the buffer cabin and 11 of us stayed up ALL NIGHT it was AWESOME! SKi shotguned 3 cans of coke and started tweekin out and he had us laughing hysterically for hours. We were all jacked up on soda and candy. We went up to the main lodge at 3 am to try and find more soda, we were unsuccesful, but we did steal milk and chocolate syrup and we took chocolate shots and ate the entire bottle in under 10 minutes. On the way back to the buffer cabin I busted my ass- I fell and twisted my ankle and cut my knee but it was funny cuz we were all messed up. It was like we were stoned and drunk, but we hadnt smoked or drank it was out of control and I got to know some great people.
Last night Ski had us all over so we could get drunk for real. I had an awesome time, even though some people were doin some CRAZY shit that I didnt see commin. TM drove me home around 1:30 and I'd passed out by 3 and didnt wake up til 6 tonight!
To summerize the whole week it was an awesome time with incredible people and I can't wait to go back next year

Maybe hanging out with ex-boyfriends ::cough coughtimwheatoncough cough:: does that to you. Thinking about the past is never really a good thing. Maybe if he didnt look good and I did I wouldnt be having this problem. Why is it that I always have to stir up the past? There must be something unfinished I have to take care of that I haven't figured out yet and until I do I'm just gonna stay on this downward spiral. This sucks. I miss Nikki.

"event","So yesterday Nikki and I went to see M.Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"". It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, If I were to see Mr. Shyamalan on the street, I would slap him across the face and DEMAND my $6.25 back(had it not been a matinee, rather than slapping him I'd kick him in the nuts) Nikki and I went expecting to see a scary movie. The review even had the audacity to say this movie would ""Haunt your dreams"", this couldnt have been further from the truth. Now I know many people are saying this movie is ""brilliant"", but the movie was a crock of shit, plain ans simple. I'll tell u how it ends so you don't waste your money. It ends up this professor was pissed off at the world and decided to do an experiment, moving a couple dozen families into a village surrounded by woods and beyond the woods, blocked by high fences, is civilization. He and the ""elders"" then claim the woods are haunted by ""large creatures"" and you cannot trespass or they'll kill you. They made costumes of these creatures and scare the shit out of people to keep them from leaving, thus living in a secluded village with no electricity, money, or medicine. wtf is that? I'm still pissed off.

The drive home however, was a different story all together. We had just lit a fat blunt no more the five minutes ago when we got pulled over by a state cop.

I look around and everyone I see is in love and I hate to say it, but I'm so jealous. I want to be in love so badly, its like my goal in life- my ultimate dream- to have this beautiful storybook romance, even though I know it will never happen. And to top it all off, I woke up Tuesday to my cell phone ringing and how was it? None other than Tim Wheaton. ""WHAT THE FUCK?!?"" is what you would be thinking to yourself if you know me/knew me in high school. Tim Wheaton was my first love. It's like someone is playing this ridiculously evil practical joke on me.

It was the first time in quite a while that I had a ""Sleep Over"" lol it makes me sound like I'm in junior high, but we had quite a few laughs. I'm really glad I've been hanging out with Foye and B-Riley lately, I've really missed them alot. I have been re-kindling some old friendships lately. Tonight for instince I got to hang out with Ryan and Pat for a little while, which was very cool.
I had alumni choir tonight, Nikki came for the first time which was excited. I felt like we were back in Madrigal class in high school, it was funny.
I'm enjoying this 3 day weekend from work far too much to take back Sunday nights. They FINALLY fired that terrible girl that never showed up for work. The fired her like two minutes after she punched in on Saturday night. I was about to leave and she came back to the front desk, punched out and left. It was very humerous.

Then we went to the Braintree mall and I got a new pair of shelltoes bringing my total to 4 pairs...I need more. Then we went to the Walpole mall and she got her ears double pierced and I got a red sox t-shirt. I had to work, but only til 8 and then Nikki, Foye and Bryan came to the Comedy show( at my work) with me. There was one guy there(I forget his name) who was absolutely hilarious. He's had Comedy Central and HBO specials. He's from Boston(Roslindale as a matter of fact) so he came to perform for fun. I almost died laughing. Then we went to Friendly's.
Overall today was a good day but strangely, I find myself depressed(again) for no reason. I dunno man, I just don't know I think I'm going crazy. this shit sucks."

Last night I had Alumni choir which went very well. We are singing the most beautiful song, Sing Me To Heaven. Concert Chorale sang it my sophmore year, it's my favorite piece from high school. All the selections Moen chose for this year's alumni choir are great, I'm looking forward to learning them all.
Today I had a very nice lunch at Perk's with Katey Foye before work. Work wasn't terrible tonight, it wasn't good, but I didn't hate it.

This is the best song lyric I've heard in quite some time. I can relate to this song quite alot at this point in my life.
So I have three days off in a row now, I don't know what I'm going to do with myself. I know I need the money, but I'm also very happy I dont have to deal with all those shitty people for 1/2 the week. Almost everyone at my work sucks. All the customers suck too. My job makes me angry, I'm always angry at work but up until now, I transformed that anger into really fake sweetness and I was always super nice to all the customers but lately, I'm just PISSED. Like today I sat a party of four at a table because the waitress next in order only had tables left. I got them they're settings and had gone back up to the front desk and two minutes later they came back up to the front desk and said ""yea, we'd prefer a booth.."" If your gonna be an asshole and ask for a booth, at least have the decency to ask BEFORE I seat you. People are such asses, you wouldn't believe. What's the big deal? Sit your ass at the fucking table and DEAL with it. Then this wicked shitty party of three came in like an hour later and I brought them to a table, they asked for a booth so I brought them to a booth, then 2 minutes later they moved back to the table... are you FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?!? People are shitty I hate everyone.
Ok I'm done with my rant, I needed to get that out, I feel much better now.
On the plus side, They let me go at 3 o'clock today and I was scheduled til 4:30. when my manager told me I could leave I was so excited- I'd never been cut early on a Saturday before. So I went to Nikki's moms house and smoked. I hadn't smoked in like two weeks so it only took me like 10 hits to get high, when I was a Super Stoner it took me like 20. I'm glad I don't smoke as much anymore, I feel like less of a useless piece of shit than usual. Anyway. Then drove to the Braintree plaza, but it was so packed, there was a carnival and shit and we were way too stoned for that shit so we just went to Newbury Comics down the street and then Wal-Mart, good times were had by all.
Tomorrow should be pleasant as well, Gina and I are going to see Shreck 2 which I am very excited about. 
I'm done."

She's trying to convince me to get an apartment with her and Adam- I said I wouldn't be confortable in that situation unless I had a boyfriend and then the four of us could move in, but I don't see that happening. It's not that I have a problem with Adam or anything, I just think that despite all efforts to make it a comfortable living situation that it would still be awkward-no matter what. Living with a couple isn't the way I wanna go.
Today at work I was outside smoking a cigarette with this girl Bridget and she has me pretty convinced I should start waitressing. She was telling me how, when she was in school, she was waitressing 4 nights a week and made enough money to pay rent, car insurance, and her cell phone bill. So I was thinking I could hostess 2 shifts and waitress 2 shifts and that would work out for me- for now anyway, but who knows.

You wouldnt know it tho, its like -1000 degrees outside its ridiculous. Last night I joined the Madrigal alumni choir(yes, we're changing the name) and that was exciting- I havent sung in 7 months since I dropped out of BSC. It's great cuz BJ, KateyFoye and B-Riley are doing it too and I'm really glad I'll be seeing them on a regular basis. But other than that things are pretty shitty. I mean I've always been relativly happy with my life, there has always been at least one thing I had going for me but lately everything has gone to shit, nothing is going right-seriously EVERYTHING. Anything that could go wrong-has. Don't get me wrong- I'm wicked excited to see BJ Foye and Bryan, tonight me and Foye went to Perks and watched a movie and talked and it was great, I'm just not happy. The whole Pat thing going up in flames is part of it, but other than that I'm not sure. Thats most of it, but then there's me basicly giving up on everything I ever wanted, like singing. Alumni choir is something, but I've given up on singing as a career- I'm just not good enogh and it sucks cuz there's nothing else I want to do. So whatever.

I have been hanging out with a bunch of people from work lately which is cool, the only downer is me and Nelson are the only ones who aren't 21. I can't wait till I turn 21 I'm gonna be such an alcoholic for like six months, then it'll get old, but it'll still be cool to be able to drink at bars ok I'm rambling."

"event","Ok so my throat is so sore that it's painful to talk- I wont even answer my phone, its just not worth it. And I have to work tomorow night I'm gonna be so miserable- but at least my temperature is down. Over the past two days I have eaten a gallon of sherbert, two dozen popsicles, five cans of soup, a million cups of tea and about eighteen gallons of water. 
I haven't smoked weed in 4 days. This sucks massive donkey balls."

"event","Well I've been sick the last couple of days and it sucks alot. I had to call in sick to work Sunday night. I was talking to Nelson the other night and he says to me, ""So what's the deal with us?"" I was so made all I could say was ""Are you kidding me!?!"" He's the one who called it off and now he's asking what the deal is with us? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Here he comes crawling back, I have to say thogh I'm not really suprised, not in a conceeded way, I could just tell.
On another note, I've become addicted to ""Average Joe: Adam Returns"" It's great I love him so much.
I bought I new bong and I havent even been able to smoke out of it yet since I've been sick, but I'm goin out tomorow no matter what."

"event","I don't know what my problem is. Today was a very good, fun and productive day. I FINALLY got my tattoo finished, got a ,marvelous little red bong and spent the day shoping with Nikki. Nothing bad happened, all was well, but for some reason I feel like I've just been going through the motions with everything I do, I'm not passionate about anything I do anymore. Esspecially today, I just feel sad and I don't know why. When I got home I just teared up for no reason I don't know what my problem is. I really hate when I'm all fucked up like this, I thought I'd gotten past it all but I guess I was wrong.
Maybe I just need to smoke or get trashed or sumthing, anything to take my mind off of everything that's wrong with my life- no boyfriend, no one to talk to, no future- just to name a few. I've just been feeling really lonely. I'm surronded by people but I feel so alone."

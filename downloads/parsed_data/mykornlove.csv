I taste like nothing, except a tomato. I'm sometimes sweet and sometimes tart; sometimes juicy, sometimes crisp. The roles of a tomato are many and varied. I am an exception to all the rules. <A HREF=""http://quiz.ravenblack.net/flavour.pl"">What Flavour Are You?</A>

You dont want love to come through to you. You like<br>it the way you are. To be unreachable, no need<br>to show feelings. Hiding everything inside you.<br>You are already used to it. You say yourself<br>that you dont need anyone, that you stand on<br>your own two feet or that you dont have time<br>for these things. But in reality you are scared<br>to get hurt. You feel save where you are: by<br>yourself, nobody can hurt you there. You<br>invent your own relationship in your dreams.<br>You just need to know that you COULD get a<br>partner.
Thats it.
PLEASE VOTE, I want to know what you think about my<br>quiz, I worked hard on it.You can always<br>message me or tell me how I can improve that<br>quiz. Ill sure write back.

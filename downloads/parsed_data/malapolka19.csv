"event","Today was a pretty good day....for a while at least.  School went by quick even if I didn't want to be there.  I came home to do nothing special.  We later left to drop my sister off at Polish school and we went shoe shopping......OMG I cannot believe I could not find black sketchers anywhere.  That really got me mad.  Maybe I have to settle for white ones.  If anyone knows where I can look please let me know....Anyways I'm out for tonight...."

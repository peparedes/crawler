""Pirate Jenny"" from <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Threepenny Opera</span>.<span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span><br /> </span></span></span><br /> So it's really fucking cold. And we turned the heat on. All these old pipes sitting in silence, biding their time until it's that really-fucking-cold time of the year. Creaking in annoyance as they're put to work. Creaking like some sort of old war machine.<br /> <br /> War machine? What the fuck. I'm tired. And cold. But.. ""nobody gonna sleep here"". Overactive imagination...<br /> <br /> When I was a kid and it was this time of year, the whole turning on the heat was a horrible, terrible thing. That's when the demons and beastly things would come out of the radiators. We've got these old radiators, you see, and when they come on, they make these creaking whistling shrieking sounds. And I would think some sort of creature was coming out to eat me. And this is still ingrained in my mind when I hear that sound.<br /> <br /> So, I'm going to be up all night, listening to all the creaks and cracks and groans coming from all the empty space. Upstairs. In the dark. Where I sleep. Alone. Stupid sounds. Last week I went upstairs and saw that the door to the spare bedroom was halfway out of the doorjamb. Of course my mind went into overdrive. I left the TV on, thinking that IF there was some sort of mass murderer hiding in there (a very bad mass murderer who can't be bothered to tightly shut doors), he or she would be waiting for me to turn the TV off, then wait an adequate amount of time afterwards, then assume I'm asleep and jab me in the neck with a knitting needle. So I left the TV on and read and left the light on. I hate how my mind works sometimes.<br /> <br /> The plus side is the smell of the heat. It's oddly comforting. It smells to me like how I'd imagine a grandparent's house would smell. Minues the old people smell. It smells like ""home"". Heat. If you go to take a hot dish out of the oven, and then smell the oven mitts afterwards, that's what it smells like. Oh, never smelled oven mitts before? Call me crazy.<br /> <br /> Back to the whole ""Pirate Jenny"" thing. Fuck me dead I love this song. So creepy. I'd post the lyrics if they weren't so long. I always like those kind of stories. Someone who seems so small and quiet, people look down on, then BAM it turns out they're psychotic and have just been biding their time to strike. <br /> <br /> I've only been able to find the German version of the song, by Lotte Lenya, which is good enough. I've heard Bea Arthur do it, and she's great. God, I'm so gay. I wish I could find Nina Simone's version. Or Ute Lemper.<br /> <br /> Lars von Trier was inspired by ""Pirate Jenny"" to create the Grace character for his America series. A little refresher course for those who don't know: von Trier isn't the biggest fan of America and is making this series about how evil and corrupt we are. Kind of. There's more to it, but that's the basic premise.<br /> <br /> The first movie was <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Dogville</span>, and Nicole Kidman (!) played Grace. She's a fugitive and the kind citizens of Dogville take her in and make her earn her keep. It all goes well. Grace is nice and quiet. But there's something up with her. A black car comes to ask about her. A man in the back hides behind a curtain, offering a reward for her. Wanted posters come up. Then a terrible thing happens to Grace, and the townspeople blame her, then turn on her and end up doing all kinds of horrible cruel things to her, and in the end she gets her (just?) revenge. The whole thing is filmed on a soundstage, with a black floor with chalk outlines of houses. Very little props. It's like a play. The movie is three hours long. Of course, it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I think it's pretty much amazing. I've watched it three times now, and it's never seemed like three hours to me.<br /> <br /> A lot of people hate the movie, of course. ""It's boring."" ""It's so unAmerican."" ""What's he trying to say?"" I guess agree most with the theory that this is von Trier's take on how we treat immigrants. They work for us, stay out of the shadows, but if they step out of line, we try to squash them. It's pretty true, but it's not like we're the only country.<br /> <br /> The second movie in this trilogy is <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Manderlay</span>. Grace is played by Bryce Dallas Howard this time. After the disaster of Dogville, she and her father and his cronies are driving home. They happen upon a plantation where slavery still exists. Oh yeah, these films all take place in the 1930s. Grace takes it upon herself to set the slaves free. This was a really really controversial movie. It deals with race. Of course it is. And I really REALLY FUCKING WANT TO SEE IT. It opened up only to art house theatres, but of course it didn't come to any around here. Not even Ithaca. I was quite saddened. BUT... Yesterday I found out it's on DVD. It's OUT already. How the fuck did I miss that boat? I put it on my Netflix queue. I just need to watch and return the stuff I have.<br /> <br /> Yesterday I also found out from Steve that Lucky McKee's <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Woods</span> is out too. WHAT THE SHIT. I need to watch some movies.<br /> <br /> Aaaaaaaaand I've been rambling. So I'm just going to shut up.<br /> <br /> Oh yeah, I want to do a whole story thing inspired by ""Pirate Jenny"". I don't know what yet. ""Pirate Jenny"" meets John Waters. That would be interesting. A play, and have it in the Brechtian style. Ugh, I'm so gay.<br /> <br /> I've decided to just post the lyrics to ""Pirate Jenny"" just for the sake of completeness.<br /> <br /> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Marc Blitzstein's translation of ""Pirate Jenny"" by Bertrolt Brecht and Kurt Weill<br /> <br /> </span><i style=""font-style: italic;"">1</i><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> You people can watch while I'm scrubbing these floors</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> And I'm scrubbin' the floors while you're gawking</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> Maybe once ya tip me and it makes ya feel swell</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> In this crummy Southern town, in this crummy old hotel</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> No. You couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'.</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> Then one night there's a scream in the night</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> And you'll wonder who could that have been</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> And you say, ""What's she got to grin?""</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> I'll tell you.</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" />  <br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> There's a ship, the black freighter</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> with a skull on its masthead</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> will be coming in.</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" />  <br style=""font-style: italic;"" />  <i style=""font-style: italic;"">2</i><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> You gentlemen can say, ""Hey gal, finish them floors!</span><br style=""font-style: italic;"" /> <span style=""font-style: italic;""> Get upstairs!

"event","I'm hopped up on tea. Yes, I realize that this is a rather gay statement. But I'm tired and don't give a shit. It just took me six times to type ""shit."" I just did it again. I keep wanting to type ""shot"".<br />  <br />  Oh, but what a mood I'm in. Earlier my glasses broke, andI shall have them fixed at Wal Mart tomorrow. I went to bed early and read for about half an hour. My eyes felt tired, so I turned off the light and layed down and closed my eyes, but twenty minutes later, here I am, bitching. I blame it on the tea. Lipton. That caffeine. I've been on this major tea kick this week. I love the stuff. It's pretty much all I've been drinking. Big mistake to drink before bed. And now I've got some DEcaffeinated Sweet Dreams tea. It should bring me down and make me sleepy, if the monitor burning into my naked eyes doesn't do it first.<br />  <br />  BUT I am in SUCH a mood to write. I fished some plans for this screenplay from a year or so ago out and I hope to maybe start working on it soon.<br />  <br />  I had a <font size=""3"" style=""font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"">Piccarillos eggplant sandwich for supper. Amazing. On the way there, I saw a cluster of those Holy Roller sign-waving people gathered in the mini-park across the street from </font><font size=""3"" style=""font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"">Piccarillos and Hunters. The ones who always picket on the four corners outside of Wegmans, preaching about God and Jesus (Jayzuz), and how the world is going to hell in a not-so-neatly-wrapped handbasket, etc. etc. They were gathered in a circle. It looked like they were getting a pep talk before heading off into the great big ol' world to keep fighting the good fight againt sinners and Sodomites. However, one of the corners was already occupied. A small cluster of people. One person waving the Stars and Stripes. The other, in a pair of fairy wings, waving a ROYGBIV Gay Pride flag. I instantly loved them. There must be a Gay Pride place or group in Auburn. I want to join! Maybe I'm just tired now. Maybe I was just really hungry at the time (haha... ""<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Some</span>one's HUNGRY!""). I just wanted to help and join the whole gay rights cause. Watching that steaming, festering dog turd of a film adaptation of the amazing graphic novel <span style=""font-style: italic;"">V For Vendetta</span>, the best part was the whole scene with Valerie's letter. It brought tears to my eyes. The one line, ""Why do they hate us"" resonated so much. All the shit people do. I never was big on movements, but coming home, with my green hair, and some fucking redneck driving by and yelling ""NICE HAIR, FAGGOT"" really incensed me to do something. It doesn't really make any sense. I've never had any outright homophobia or hatred directed toward me, myself, but I just feel fed up with ignorance and such. Coming to know about the Phelpses didn't help either. Fuck them. In the ass. Ugh. I'm all tired and self-righteous. I need to go write.</font>"

"event","Watching the <em>Science of Sleep</em> trailer. Looks a bit like <em>Eternal Sunshine</em>, but I don't care. Looks all quirky and lovely. I want to see it. I just have this thing for unconventional love stories. Awwwbigsigh.<br /><br />Want to see <em>Sweeney Todd</em> too. Gah. Tickets are going, going, going.<br /><br />Oh, yeah. Today, I was at Marten's, with my father, getting fresh corn and zucchini and stuff, and as I was getting corn, a vehicle drove by, and this loud voice blared, yelling, ""NICE HAIR, FAGGOT!"" Lovely. I go all the way out to Idaho, and I never get any overly hateful comments about my hair, I'm home for less than a week, and, hello homophobic ignorance. I hate to say it, but it made me feel shitty. More shitty at their intolerance and the fact that they probably wouldn't have said anything if they were just walking by me instead of driving by. I fucking hate that I have to live surrounded by these types of people, that I have to feel crappy because of who I am. Fuck them. I need NYC.<br /><br />I really need to put the finishing touches on my journal I kept during the trip. I didn't document that Saturday, when I went to the redneck reception. These people were all sorts of proud of being redneck. Nothing against rednecks, but the image I see in the media is of two-stepping, cowboy-hat-wearing, truck-driving, drunken wife-beaters. Hell yeah at pride for that. But I'm sure they wouldn't be too keen on gay pride, although I'm sure I'm a lot more able to hold my tongue.<br /><br />There was one guy who was wasted and all over Nettie. She told him off, and he'd come over me, putting his arms on my shoulders and talking quietly about her. It was disgusting. I was beyond uncomfortable, but didn't say anything. I've been around enough drunks to know that some of them can be set off by the slightest hint of sarcasm. Reminded me of Burns and JR and others I've witnessed beating the shit out of the women they ""love."" I had this awful twisting in my stomach all night. I hate that I have to feel like that, but you never know what alcohol is going to do.<br /><br />I used to be anti-booze. Not straight-edge, just didn't like alcohol and didn't see any point in it besides to make you a fucking blubbering idiot. Now I just realize I'm anti-idiots who can't handle their alcohol and end up beating the shit out of loved ones or driving and killing others. Just the other day this guy drove drunk and crashed, sending his four year old daughter flying out of the windshield. I have no sympathy for him. Ugh. End rant.<br /><br />So, on a good note, I have a new dog. This couple at the Redneck reception breeds Jack Russel Terriers, and Mom bought a puppy. He had a spiked collar, and when Mom told me to name him, I tried to think of punk-ish artists. Baudelaire came to mind. Didn't fit. Then I went from JACK Russel Terrier to JACK to.... JACKson Pollock. He was kind of a punk in his day, so I named him Jackson Pollock, and Mom likes Jack Nicholson, so his full name is Jackson Nicholson Pollock. I hate people who give their dogs full names (hi, Star Jones), but oh well.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/000018pz/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" align=""left"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/000018pz/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/00002c5e/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/00002c5e/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/00004911/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/0000379q/s320x240"" alt="""" /> <img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/00004911/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/000059x8/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/000059x8/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a> <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/00006sx9/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/00006sx9/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/000085qh/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/00007z8g/s320x240"" alt="""" /> <img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/000085qh/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/00009cs2/""><img width=""319"" height=""229"" border=""0"" align=""middle"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/kiriyama6_kills/pic/00009cs2/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><br />Gah.

So..... I masturbated.





And I was tired and didn't want to get a tissue, so I just let it go in my hand.




And then I must have nodded off. With the mess in my hand.


And then I woke up, and it was gone. Only it wasn't. It was like my hand absorbed it. Like a...YES. Like a LOTION. My hand was all smooth and supple. And a bit sticky. Obviously I washed my hands.

And Amy(Greene, not my sister)'s response to an email I sent her. She was a sort-of-friend. More of a friend of Randy and some other people I don't remember. Anyway, she had borrowed some of my underground horror books (Ed Lee!) and then after a falling out with some mutual friends, moved. I was pissed, since she had had my books forever, and I never got them back, and sent her a semi-harsh email. I didn't think she ever responded, but I found it. I should read it.

"event","Today was a pretty good day. Many things learned. It was <em>so</em> good and I'm <em>so</em> cool, I'm going to be totally cool and give you the blow-by-blow.....<br /><br />World Lit. Finished up Baudelaire (Valdina made comment about Baudelaire dying his hair green, made a comment about how I should have done it for today, everyone looked, HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHHHHHHHHHAAAA). I'm going to miss her...uh...sultry voice reciting such hot stuff.<br /><br />Was going to get a haircut, decided to wait until Saturday. Plan for going to mall with Nikki and Sandi. We hang out for a bit, then head out.<br /><br />Walk around mall, go into Asian store. I got myself some pretty nifty chopsticks, (OH SHIT I LEFT THEM IN SANDI'S CAR), and now I can be a COOL fat kid and whip them out at China Buffets 'round the world and tell them no need to supply their weak little wooden sticks. I have my own, thank you sir.<br /><br />Leaving the mall, I spot a Hooters, and make a (sarcastic) comment about how we should go there. I am taken seriously and it's considered such a good idea that Sandi thinks she can pull into the parking lot, when she's three lanes away. A near accident. We go to a bank, get money, and go back to Hooters. Slightly ditzy waitress. Nikki has the hots for her. Realizes she's a lesbian. BAM. Epiphany. Wow. Continues checking out waitresses. Waitress says she's ""tired"" and we get a new waitress, who's kind of a bitch. We leave.<br /><br />Back at Sandi's my lack of getting a haircut is mentioned. While doing up Nikki's hair and putting in her chopsticks, Sandi says she'll do my hair. I say, ""Okay. Wait. No. Not okay. Well...okay."" On and on and on. I decided to give in. A few snips and a close call with some scissors later, I have a nice new haircut. I like it. A lot. I say it many times throughout the night. We head out to go....[drumroll]....BOWLING.<br /><br /><img src=""http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a230/kiriyama_kills/IMG_2180.jpg"" alt=""Holy New Haircut"" /> (holy new haircut)<br /><br />We bowl. I lose. Badly. I get a 45 or something. Nikki and Sandi don't do all that much better. We realize we don't have any more money and decide to leave. I go to the bathroom. Go into stall. Pee. Flush. Open door, hit something, assume it's a human, say (since I'm a considerate human being), ""Sorry."" I see it's just a sink. Some really COOL (note sarcasm) redneck-ish guy says, ""Oh, I think ya bruised tha sink thar. Heh heh."" I say, ""I think it'll be okay."" I go to wash my hand. No knobs on the sink. The really funny guy turns off his water, which means you're done with the sink usually, and I turn the knobs and start washing my hands just as the funny guy pumps soap onto his hands. ""Oh, wanna share ma sink, do ya?"" he asks. ""I sure do, sir,"" I reply. I leave. I make a big deal. No one else thinks it's a big thing. We leave.<br /><br />We decide to go to Denny's. Stop at Sandi's so she can take her own car and Nikki can take her own car. We go to Denny's. Nikki tells Gaby she's a lesbian. Discussion follows. We wait to get waited on. I share the outline of my new short screenplay (wow I'm really cool). Nikki shows us how to play Texas Hold 'Em. We draw and wait. Draw and wait. Ever since Nikki got fired by that bitch (forget her name), it's been shitty going to Denny's. The Bitch is the manager. We never get waited on. No one asks what we want to drink. Fuckers. We leave.<br /><br />So I got dropped off and now I'm hear, and now I'm done."

Ulla Thurman can sing. And sing well, too! Will Farrell threatened to break loose a few times, but he was good as the Nazi playwright. Roger Bart and the guy who plays Roger de Bris (I forget his name and don't feel like looking it up) were good. Roger Bart plays a good flamboyant mo. Gary Whatshisface does drag well. They did cut my favorite part from the stage show, though. In the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Springtime For Hitler</span> sequence, de Bris as Hitler (a GAY HITLER [""Heil myself""] - how genius is that?!] defeats Stalin (by shoving him offstage) and FDR (by pushing him-by his wheelchair-offstage as well).

You get the point. We passed through the bar district (whatever the street's called), and we shouted something just as a yuppie couple were getting into their vehicle. We kept going, then noticed a vehicle following us. We panicked, thinking it was the yuppie couple. I suggest we went down the Austeel service road to see if we were being followed (it comes out onto North Street-I think). We turned. We were followed. That's when I started freaking out, thinking some psycho was going to drive us off the road and/or kill/rape us. I tend to overreact to such things, but hey, I have an excuse. Anyway, as we came out onto North street, the vehicle turned out to be a cop car as its lights lit up. We got pulled over. MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF BEING PULLED OVER. And the cop was a dick too. Apparently, Nikki wasn't driving to terribly well, sliding all over the road. At least we weren't pulled over for screaming obscenities into the still of the night.<br><br>Oh, and I tried cigarettes for the first time. Didn't like it at all.

<br>
Wow, that sounded gay.<br>
<br>
Well, anyway, I recently got over that. I haven't been on the computer
(gasp!) for a few days. The thing crashed or something. Couldn't get
on. Had to delete the entire C Drive. So, everything I've written/been
writing for the past year and a half. Gone. All my photos. All my
music. Gone. I was pretty fucking depressed. This on top of my mother
being out of work since about Christmas time (my dad <span style=""font-style: italic;"">just</span>
getting back from being sick), my financial problems, blah blah blah. I
was feeling pretty low. Then the whole computer thing. It sounds really
fucking lame, but it felt like losing children. All these people
(characters) I've created. Loved, hated, wanted to finish their
stories. Notes I've made. Outlines. The few things I finished. Some I
started. Gone. All gone. And yes, I realize in the whole grand scheme
of things, this is all pretty irrelevant.<br>
<br>
Well, I've pretty much come to grips with all that. I'd printed out
some of my outlines, so that's not all lost. I just need to find them.
I still have my Photobucket account with all my photos (duh) I've
uploaded there.<br>
<br>

"event","<P>So the other night I woke up at about 1 in the morning and couldn't fall asleep, so I watched <EM>The Royal Tenenbaums</EM>. It's now officially one of my favorite movies. Wes Anderson is a god at editing and selecting songs for soundtracks (so are Tarantino and Cameron Crowe). The prologue, set to the the orchestral version of ""Hey Jude"" by Mark Mothersbough, with&nbsp;the climax of Richie letting Mordecai soar over the city as the song crescendos&nbsp;to the&nbsp;auditory orgasm of&nbsp;the ""na na na na na na na Hey Juuuuuuuuuuude""s (I'm a complete sucker for songs with ""na na na""s in them. Clapping too), it gives me shivers every time. Plus the use of Nico and The Velvet Underground. I must have been really tired, but I was crying at the end. Fuck you, I was tired and yawning, and when I yawn, my eyes tear up and...yeah...</P>
<P>Speaking of auditory orgasms and Beatles songs, I cannot wait for this new movie by Julie Taymor. A musical set in the 60's, with Beatles songs. Taymor is such an amazing creative mind (<EM>Lion King</EM> stage production, <EM>Titus</EM>, <EM>Frida</EM>), and I can't wait for this to come out. It had better come to Auburn. Or Ithaca.</P>
<P>After <EM>The Royal Tenenbaums</EM>, <EM>Harold and Maude</EM> was on. Watched some of that. Probably one of the greatest love stories EVER. Speaking of love stories, I've been working on the one I wrote about before, but all I've really managed to do is convert it from third person to first person. Go me. It's about an on-again, off-again prostitute with schizophrenia and a pretty bad drug habit falling in love with a guy, and they go off on a road trip to visit an old friend and the guy's family. I'm not sure where I'm going with it. Hopefully I'll figure it out.</P>
<P>I'm going to be really cool and make a list of my top ten favorite movies.</P>
<P><EM>Dogville</EM><BR><EM>The Royal Tenenbaums<BR>The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover<BR>The Graduate<BR>Female Trouble<BR>Kill Bill </EM>(both volumes as one)<BR><EM>Rosemary's Baby</EM></P>
<P>Meh. I could only come up with seven I really truly love.</P>
<P>I bought <EM>Pucnh Drunk Love</EM> at BJ's for 9.99. <STRONG>9 fucking .99</STRONG>. I love BJ's [insert imature double entendre giggle here, that means you, Nikki]. I should go watch it.</P>
<P>And I also ordered some shirts from RottonCotton.</P>
<P>A <EM>Wicker Man </EM>one. A <EM>Battle Royale </EM>one. Camp Crystal Lake. Divine. ""Everytime You Masturbate, God Kills a Kitten."" ""P.E.T.A. : People For the Eating of Tasty Animals."" I'm not proud of those last two. Can't wait for them to come innnnnnn.</P>

"event","<P>So this morning Mom mentioned the Village Camera Shop again, and asked if I'd be ""terribly offended"" if I knew what I was getting for Christmas, after I choose the camera I want. Of course I won't be. It's still kind of settling that I'm probably going to be getting one.</P>
<P>I seem to have lost my cell phone. I'm quite sad.</P>
<P>Last night was the final night of Intro to Moving Image. We watched one of my favorite movies I forgot about, <EM>Shallow Grave</EM>. I loooove watching it with people who have never seen it, and therefore don't know the little twists throughout. The reactions were priceless. Good stuff.</P>
<P>Yesterday was the last day for Western Civ, Abnormal Psych, and Economics. I think I did...eh...al<EM>right</EM>. I hope I did. I'm just a little bothered that the sense of relief I was expecting isn't coming.</P>
<P>This weekend I plan on re-reading everything for World Lit. I even plan on making little note cards to study from. Now, if this actually happens, I'll be surprised. I really, really want to pass this class, dammit.</P>"

"event","<P>So I haven't updated in a while, and Nikki told me to update, so I guess I will.</P>
<P>The semester's almost over, and I have a shitload of stuff I have to get done. I should be doing that instead of updating this thing. But I'm a sucker for procrastination.</P>
<P>I only have today, tomorrow, and tomorrow night, then I'm totally done. Except a test Monday. THEN I'm done. Then I can look for a job. Start going back to the Y. It'll all be good.</P>
<P>I really should be working on this goddamn paper. It's for World Lit, a class I don't even need, and I'm not sure why I'm stressing. That paper's 6-8 pages. Then a 5-page paper for Western Civ. I need to finish a ton of little assignments for the same class. Study for Abnormal Psych. Study for Economics. Do the last assignment for Economics. Blah, blah, blah, I know, but this is actually kind of therapeutic, so shut it.</P>
<P>Mom and Dad asked me what kind of camera I want last night (!!!!!). So I guess that means I'm actually going to get one. Wow. I'm beyond excited. I've only been wanting a camcorder ever since I knew what one was. And now I might be getting one. ;aksjflsgflsflsfdlhng We're going to go to the Village Camera shop. That's where Mom got her digital camera, and where Uncle Tom, the family's expert on this type of stuff, said we would get the best deal on the best digital camcorder.</P>
<P>And I keep kicking myself, harder each day, over NOT majoring in video at CCC. Stupidfuckingidiotmotherfucker. GAH. I didn't think it was what I wanted, and come to find out, it IS what I wanted. God damn it.</P>
<P>Ah well. I guess I'm going to start my World Lit paper. Blah.</P>"

"event","<P>Last night I saw <EM>Derailed.</EM> I'd read the book and maybe since I knew what was coming, that could explain why I wasn't so thrilled with the movie. Two of my favorite actors, Clive Owen and Vincent Cassel, in a decent little thriller. And I honestly think Jennifer Aniston is a decent actress. And The RZA's not too shabby. So anyway, the movie was...eh...</P>
<P>And today I went to Ithaca to see <EM>Good Night, and Good Luck</EM> and <EM>A History of Violence</EM>. <EM>Good Luck, and Good Night </EM>was interesting. Almost all of the action took place inside the CBS studio. The black and white photography was beautiful. Great acting. The camerawork was really different, and I'm not sure if it was different in a good way or not.</P>
<P><EM>A History of Violence</EM> was alright.&nbsp;I guess I was so hyped about it I feel a bit let down. It's hard to believe it's a David Cronenberg film. Pretty un-Cronenberg-esque. There were a few touches, such as unexpected moments of really, really dark humor.</P>
<P>Oooo. I went to the second-hand book shop and got a few books, one of which is John Waters' <EM>Trash Trio</EM>, the scripts to <EM>Pink Flamingos</EM>, <EM>Desperate Living</EM>(my favorite Waters film), and <EM>Flamingos Forever</EM>, the unfilmed sequel to <EM>Pink Flamingos</EM>. I got the script to <EM>Breaking the Waves</EM> as well.</P>
<P>Then, at this used-CD/DVD/record shop, I found <EM>Southern Comfort</EM> for $12. Yay for trannies.]</P>
<P>Now I have to go finish the first disc of <EM>24</EM>'s 3rd season and watch <EM>Palindromes</EM> (yay for Tod Solonz&lt;3) so I can send them back to Netflix.</P>"

"event","<p>So, I have the BSG Last Supper photo on my desktop, and as I started to sign off after tonight's ep, I remembered they'd said the picture revealed everything for the final season. Obviously this is in retrospect, and it's probably been said already by someone more astute, but, as a major DaVinci Code fan, I had to post these portions of it:<br /></p><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Spoilers from tonight's ep"">Six is the sacrificial lamb, with Baltar figuring as John the Beloved, and we see this come to pass at the end of the episode when Athena shoots NatalieSix in cold blood...<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/centaurea/pic/000346hr/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""208"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/centaurea/pic/000346hr/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />Obviously her death changes the whole game, though it doesn't necessarily imply she's the saviour, since the roles are all shuffled throughout the tableau. <br /><br />The BSG Last Supper is missing a person on the left side, who is interestingly not the Judas figure--Lee has his elbow on the table, the same rude gesture as the original Judas, though he is facing away, rather than having Judas' expression of shock at being found out--but rather Peter.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thinking about it now, I suppose that's fairly appropriate, since Peter is the rock the church was built on, and the Final Cylon would be the cornerstone of this whole mystery. However, in the DaVinci conspiracies, Peter's slashing hand gesture towards John/Mary Magdeline and the knife in his other hand&nbsp;is considered part of what reveals the ""truth"" of the Magdeline story.&nbsp;These symbols aren't missing--Tyrol has the knife, and Athena has the slash (oh, the fanfic):<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/centaurea/pic/00035cgg/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""151"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/centaurea/pic/00035cgg/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />Tonight's ending is shown by these two gestures: she's grasping Karl's hand to show familial solidarity and slashing with her right hand across the same sight line as Six's exposed wrist, like so:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/centaurea/pic/00036b5e/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""124"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/centaurea/pic/00036b5e/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />Incidentally, I got the idea for the overlay from <a href=""http://www.spacewesterns.com/articles/60/"">this guy</a>, who makes some very interesting points, but I don't think quite got it.

"event","So, I pull up in line at the Starbucks this morning to get my Monday morning courage and suddenly, this thing catches my attention--a huge spider is lurching down the building near the car in front of me.&nbsp;The driver&nbsp;looks over and is watching it with huge eyes, leaned away from his window. I stare at it, mouth agape. I see the people behind me pointing, incredulous. <br /><br />The car pulls up, and I'm next to it now, and it is at least the size of my fist, if not more. At one point, it runs down to the sidewalk and towards my car, so I think it must be making a break for the bushes on the other side of the driveway. Hoping I don't run over it, I pull forward. <br /><br />My window keeps getting stuck down lately, so I pull up to the window and open my door to hand the girl my card. Next thing I know, there the spider is, about a foot away from the window! So I say to her, ""Um, you might wanna close your window a minute, because there is a HUGE spider out here."" Of course, nobody really understands what you mean by huge until they look themselves, so she pokes her head out and screams, running into the center of her spot, away from the open window. Each barista takes a turn at the window, looking and squealing, and of course the whole line of cars is full of people pointing and covering their mouths. <br /><br />At this point, we're all a little hysterical with laughter and creepiness, and as she finishes my order, the spider comes EVEN CLOSER, all the way to the edge of the window, with me going, ""UM!!! UM!!! SOMEONE SHOULD CLOSE THE WINDOW!!!!"" <br /><br />The barista looks at me and says, ""Are you ready?"" So I say, ""Yes!"" and she tosses my drink and scone to me and I speed off. $10 bucks says the thing made it inside. I'm pretty sure it was a male wolf spider.<br /><br />You know you want to see: <br /><a title=""Danger at the Starbucks Window by sdpalladio, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahphrase/2467155475/""><img height=""180"" alt=""Danger at the Starbucks Window"" width=""240"" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3004/2467155475_634835b6ec_m.jpg"" /></a> <br /><br /><a title=""Starbucks Spider by sdpalladio, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahphrase/2467980716/""><img height=""240"" alt=""Starbucks Spider"" width=""178"" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2039/2467980716_2887f79dc5_m.jpg"" /></a>"

"event","<p>We just opened our new hospital on campus, and there are a lot of new people around. My office is at the end of a very long, convoluted hallway, and you can't accidentally get there. It's like 4:45, and the head of the new ER walks in to ""introduce himself to the neighbors,"" which originally really confused us because the ER is nowhere near here. We cracked ourselves up with picturing him walking down the long, long hallway, randomly walking into offices and shaking hands like a politician.<br /><br />Today we figured out that his private office is on the hallway, so that makes more sense. I'd actually met him several times before, but I let that slide since I'm sure he meets a lot of people every day.</p><p>Anyway, he starts saying how he and some other doctors just started a new Emergency Medicine journal, and I say that's wonderful, and that I know the staff of the main EM journal, which I'm sure he reads because published by their main association, so I'm familiar with the issues they might run into. But he looks at me blankly and says, ""No, this is a new journal.""</p><p>So I try to explain for him, ""Yes, but I mean, I know the journal staff of JAEM. They're very nice."" And he keeps looking at me kind of spacey, and says, ""They don't work on this. This is the journal we just started.""</p><p>There was a beat where Robin looked at me and started to jump in there to clarify, and I just gave him my best Bless His Heart smile, wished him luck, and said we were available for any related journal questions he might have.</p><p>Doctors.

"event","<p>What a weekend! I ate at my two favorite places ever while visiting my brother in Orlando to attend a yoga seminar. His 28th birthday was last Wednesday, so I went a bit early. Friday night we hit Seasons 52, and if you're ever in a city that has one, YOU MUST GO. The one in Orlando is fantastic, right on a lake. It had been 80 degrees, so we took patio seating as the sun set over the lake and ordered mojitos--they make the best ones. Their theme is to change the menu with the season for the freshest food, and change the specials by the week so there's always something new. All the food is under 500 calories, and I've never had anything I didn't like there. Carmelized scallops, sun-dried tomato pearl pasta, and asparagus. Hello! With one of those shotglass-full desserts of chocolate and peanut butter mousse. If you want to know who started that trend, it was them.</p><p>We stayed up way too late every night talking about his new job with the space program, and I feel very educated now on the whole thing. I also discovered one of my personal pet peeves: unfinished roads with turnoffs to nowhere. You know what I mean--you can SEE where you want to go, but the road isn't done? He was showing me the Google map of NASA and pointed out where the road to the original Launch Pad A should have been (the one they use most often is called Launch Pad A, but was really Launch Pad C). It just ends in the forest. Did you know they'd originally planned to have launch pads all over the coastline and send up a shuttle every week? Only 2 were built, but they're thinking of finishing the 3rd. Not seriously, really, but it comes up. And, so, I am personally starting the I SUPPORT LAUNCH PAD C campaign just so they'll finish the road :D</p><p>During our lunch break on Sunday, I spotted something that made my heart glad: bd's Mongolian Grill. I'd been to the one in Traverse City several years ago and had a blast, but there were none in Florida. I even tried convincing one of my friends who wanted to buy a franchise to bring them down, but no luck. 3 years later, HOORAY. Joshua met me there after yoga and we celebrated with a margarita (that's my post-yoga celebratory restaurant rule) and ridiculous amounts of stir fry. </p><p>Somehow I don't think celebrating my own bday in Jax with my parents this weekend will be quite that fun, but it was a nice break.&nbsp;<br /><br />Yoga training went well. I surprised myself with how shakey I felt during our first class, but now I think it was related to not eating lunch first! Duh! When it's at that facility, it starts at a weird time, so it never occurs to me to get food before I'm stuck in class. Most of the material not related to poses was about communication--with yourself and with your class. Timely and helpful. It was my favorite instructor, and she keeps things from getting too weird or burdensome. Good group, good class, but I'm glad to be done. Feels like I'm finally starting to make progress on my training, and I'm subbing in for classes the next two Thursdays.<br /><br />In other news, sorry I haven't been around much on LJ. Just been absorbed in other things. But I still love you! ;-)</p>"

Aliens, I assume, but who knows.&nbsp;<br />* They were trapped by being filmed originally? Or disappeared because they ran out of work? Or both?&nbsp;<br />* The first two can escape off the film as shadows, but the others have to walk out of the middle of the screen in plain sight?&nbsp;<br />* They stole people's breath in the past for what reason? To listen to them scream in a bottle?&nbsp;<br />* If they were only there to steal people's breaths and the victims still existed, why did the carnival disappear with all the people in the past?&nbsp;<br />* One breath actually remained IN the bottle when it was open?&nbsp;<br />* What was going on with the puddle of water? It used to be the ocean? An abandoned pool?&nbsp;<br />* Why didn't they just GO to the ocean?! It's not like Britain isn't an island.&nbsp;<br />* They're ""ghost makers"" but they keep the ghosts in a box that no one ever sees? How did anyone know about the ghosts then?&nbsp;<br />* When the people finally do die, the ghosts don't exist anymore? Isn't that, like, reverse ghost principle?<br /><br />Furthermore, you can't tell me that Jack happily blew his head off every night just to track down The Night Travelers, and then didn't catch them or even know who they were until now.&nbsp;Because, if everyone in the film walked off the screen into real life except Jack,&nbsp;that means THEY were the Night Travelers, and he worked with them.&nbsp;I guess you could argue that it was 2 carnivals spliced together, but Jack says specifically that he remembers the people on the film. So who are the people that appeared suddenly in the middle of the night and didn't advertise? And if Jack was at that very carnival, how did he miss the fact that the WHOLE THING DISAPPEARED?! Did it disappear because they were aliens, or did it disappear because someone filmed them? Either way, why wasn't he just left standing in the field, because he is clearly not trapped in celluloid.<br /><br />I'M SO CONFUSED.<br /><br />This is one of those episodes that just make me feel terrible for the actors that they had to be serious and act out the whole thing when it was forced-excitement plot with zero character development.&nbsp;<br /><br />Total. Bollocks.<br /><br />Of course&nbsp;I hated ""Small Worlds"" too. If you're a PJ fan, I'm sure you enjoyed both of them, but I am unmovable, so please don't try and convince me otherwise.

He has the touch. That last look with the feathers is wild, but hypnotic.<br />* Chris - a little Cruella de Ville, but I LOVE the screen printing and color transitions.<br />* Jillian - clearly stuck on the dark grey steel and belt look...&nbsp;well made,&nbsp;but I don't see much of an evolution.<br /></div>"

"event","<p>The holidays are always full of extremes, aren't they? It seems like just as you get ready for one thing, the time for that has past and it's on to another thing that you're not ready for. Nothing ever really settles down, and everything conspires to keep it that way. Or something like that. Cases in point:<br /><br />1. Cards: Doing Christmas cards was the last thing on my list. I was so in the mood to write them last week, but didn't have time. I carried them to work with me and back. Finally, yesterday, I had time.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; Then I had a brainchild: Hey, some of my relatives have never met Adam, so I should do pictures! I printed out some small ones on the work printer, which is lovely, but then tends to stick to things.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; Another brainchild: Hey! I should send some to Walgreens from Snapfish! I can pick them up on the way home!<br />&nbsp; Phone call, finally, at 9 PM from Walgreens: Sorry, our downloads are taking too long. See you tomorrow. So, I opt back to the printed versions... now I don't have photo corners. Blow the whole thing off til this morning.<br />&nbsp; Stopped by Michael's this morning to pick up photo corners....<br />&nbsp; Incidentally, have you ever gone in there in a sentimental mood? Particularly into the scrapbooking area? Personally, and on every other day, I feel that scrapbooks are the Great Satan of Modern Womanhood. I see the pictures of mothers and daughters happily bonding over Scrapping, and first of all, if that were my mother and I, one of us would end up dead in a heap of glitter&nbsp;with butterfly-shaped holes punched out of our skin; secondly, I can't imagine spending 4 hours on 5 pages in a scrapbook--photo-fiend that I am, I would still be on my child's 2nd birthday as I sent them off to college; thirdly, the activity perpetuates The Evil that is cutting photographs into little cute shapes, and, since nobody can cut a perfectly even circle, lopsided ones at that.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; But today, I wander in and am captured by the Shiny that is the Martha Stewart aisle of tissue paper flowers and wedding favors on sale and whatever and I'm like, oohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; *glazed eyes*&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; *fantasizing about all the little romantic things I could whip up*<br /><em>&nbsp; </em>Then it took 6 rows and 15 minutes to find photo corners, and I was back to my cynical, foo-foo paper-and-glue-hating self.<br />&nbsp; Anyway, at noon, Walgreens calls and the pictures are done. Glossy, much to my horror, and not cut apart, which means I will get fingerprints all over them.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; Finally, at 2, I sit down to do them in between editing Moments in Ophthalmic History *snore* and... I cannot think of a word to say to people that doesn't sound completely ridiculous, particularly to the expectant parents on the list. What do you say? Can't wait to hear about the baby eventually coming at some point if you even remember&nbsp;me by then because you're covered in baby drool and the last thing you'll be worrying about is informing your 3rd grade best friend?&nbsp;Nothing sounds right.&nbsp;<br /><br />My Christmas cards are doomed, I just know it.<br /><br />2. Food: Prior to going up north 10 days ago, I resolved to eat healthily, knowing I'd be running about willy-nilly and needed to be well. So, I did--I had salads and veggies and juice and no Starbucks. I felt great.<br />&nbsp; Then I went up to visit, and we got engaged and embarked upon our Tour de Family and Friends. At this point my diet turned entirely into champagne and hors d'oeuvres. And the occasional ham and cheese from Dunkin' Donuts. By Sunday morning, my stomach was completely shot.&nbsp;And when I say completely, I mean completely.<br />&nbsp; Thanks to that, I was on oatmeal and soup for the remainder of the week, given that my stomach soundly protested against anything that <em>tasted</em>. Dear Tummy, no, I would NOT like to have yet another bowl of plain Farina, even if it WOULD greatly amuse my late grandfather, God rest his soul, that all I can eat is what he ate&nbsp;as breakfast porridge in 1918. Love, Me.<br />&nbsp; Then Party Season kicked back up on Friday, and now I have pretty much eaten nothing for 4 days but spiced ham, tiny buns and mustard,&nbsp;and chocolate fudge. And the occasional pear, thanks to a basket from our publisher. Healthy!<br />&nbsp; Tomorrow I plan on implementing my Peppermint Mocha Frappuchino-only diet. By Christmas I should have red and green sugar sprinkles floating on the surface of my eyeballs.<br />&nbsp; The good news is, I'll have enough preservatives in my system to sit on the shelf without&nbsp;spoiling&nbsp;til May.<br /><br />3. I had some other point, but I forgot what it is. Maybe I'll remember after finishing this fudge.</p>"

And I gave myself&nbsp;a pass for a while, thinking it would hit me later,&nbsp;&nbsp;buying a couple things the day after. Then it hit me on that&nbsp;Saturday: I am going up to Massachusetts this Thursday, and if I don't buy everything for&nbsp;</p><lj user=""shakasulu"">and his family (and in the process, everyone else) within a few days, it won't get there on time.&nbsp;His house is now laden with boxes that he is not allowed to open.<br /><br />And so, I am just now emerging from a week-long haze of Christmas ideas/creation/purchasing/bills, etc., including a long weekend in Orlando with my brother where we hit the Millennia Mall 3 times,&nbsp;Waterford Lakes 2 times,&nbsp;and the new IKEA, which, because it only opened a couple of weeks ago,&nbsp;involves shopping with approximately&nbsp;the entire population of Europe.&nbsp;There should totally be an oasis in every corner, because between the 3 million square feet, cloth fibers, and dry warehouse air, I was in a state of near delerium by the time I hit the bottom floor where you buy everything. Which may be by design, I'm not sure.<br /><br />As I wandered through the&nbsp;Nouveau Scary Large Candy World of Lights Scents Music Christmasland, two memories from holidays past occurred to me:<br /><br />1. <strong>""That's not from <em>Santa</em>!""</strong> - My parents were very religious when I was little, so we did not believe in Santa. Sure, they told me <em>about</em> Santa, and I knew all the stories and carols and whatnot, but I knew who my presents came from. My grandparents&nbsp;compromised by making some tags from ""Grandma and Grandpa,"" some from ""Baby Jesus,"" and some from ""Santa and Rudolph.""&nbsp;<br /><img alt="""" align=""right"" src=""http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:EibbEIOv6ayiNM:http://www.palmbeachpost.com/shared-blogs/palmbeach/thompson/media/David%2520Caruso.jpg"" /><br />I remember one Christmas very clearly where all the grandchildren sat near the tree, tearing through the gifts, where my older cousin said to me, ""Look what Santa gave me!"" I, being all of probably 5 or 6, pulled the name tag off her gift, held it next to mine, and busted out with the handwriting comparison. ""Aimee, THAT's not from Santa.&nbsp;It's Grandma. Her handwriting is exactly the same! Look at the t's! Look at the a's! It's the <em>same pen!!!</em>"" If I'd had a chemistry set, God only knows what I would have done to prove it.<br /><br />I finally realized this weekend, regardless of what I'd been told, I was clearly too much of a nerd to believe there was a Santa, even then. Honestly, I thought Grandma was just being ironic, and cleverly so. It never occurred to me they were trying to fool anyone. Because, by George, <em>the handwriting was the SAME. </em>*puts on black shades*<br /><br />2. <strong>Child of the 80s Flashback</strong> - Who else played with Strawberry Shortcake dolls?&nbsp;They all had cute little girl&nbsp;outfits and pets and were scented.&nbsp;My favorite one was Lime Chiffon--not because I was crazy about her look, but because she smelled the best, like vanilla and citrus. I'm not really sure how we all looked, snorting our dolls and whatnot, but I loved that smell.<br /><br />While shopping for stocking stuffers this weekend, I went into <strong>Yankee Candle</strong> and&nbsp;was smelling down the wall of votives when my eyes went wide and I grabbed my brother's arm. ""OHMYGOD!!! Smell this! This is so familiar!! WHAT. IS. IT?!....... IT'S LIME&nbsp;CHIFFON DOLL!""<br /><br />He, of course, backed away from the lunacy and took my word for it (they didn't sell scented Legos, I guess), while I purchased&nbsp;a Vanilla Lime votive&nbsp;immediately so that I can continue my doll-sniffing in an adult fashion--by making my whole apartment smell like one.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.yankeecandle.com/cgi-bin/ycbvp/product_detail.jsp?oid=4092633""><img alt="""" align=""middle"" src=""http://www.yankeecandle.com/yc/images/retail/120/1107081.jpg"" /></a>&nbsp;= <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/centaurea/pic/00030b43/""><img height=""130"" alt="""" width=""98"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/centaurea/pic/00030b43/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><br />Incidentally, Hasbro, I am disappointed in you: the new versions of Strawberry Shortcake Kids look like Jon-Benet Ramsey's, not&nbsp;freckly munchkin toddlers. For shame!<p>&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""My feelings on Razor"">Of course it was great to have BSG back for the night--the poundy&nbsp;drums, the&nbsp;rebooted count on the&nbsp;White Board of Extinction (my favorite character), etc. I thought the battle scenes all looked great, and the panning of Pegasus in dry dock was beautiful.&nbsp;I didn't even think the old Cylons and their ""by your command"" was too cheezy.<br /><br />Overall, though, I didn't think it was quite explanatory enough, and it was a bit too soft. The story lingered so much on the interplay between its four main female characters that it started to feel like the Ship That Estrogen Built.&nbsp;Furthermore, Cain playing with her oversized pocket knife, which heretofore had no meaning&nbsp;or use,&nbsp;wasn't menacing or significant&nbsp;enough to be the inspiration for the title. &nbsp;<br /><br />If their goal was to humanize Cain and provide understanding as to how things devolved on the Pegasus, ok, but each major point of horror as recounted prior to now--the XO's shooting, the Scylla massacre,Gina's torture--was not nearly as clear as it should have been to accomplish that goal. It's one thing to show ""what really happened"" versus our sensationalized understanding from the mouth of a drunken XO. It's another thing to blunt the horrors almost entirely and decline to show the rest.<br /><br />1. The XO Shooting - She's just decided to engage the enemy; the XO resists; without deliberation, she takes his pistol and shoots him. At no point do we see her noting a rising doubt in her crew, which would demand a definitive action. She doesn't seem unsure. She doesn't think about it. They don't have an antagonistic relationship. Essentially, there is no reason or warning. We're left to reason with ourselves, desperate times... one action and the crew will follow her without question... all those things could have been indicated through other means, like her glancing around to see other crew starting to question their duities. The way this went down made less sense than either her being a straight-up hardass or her making an offensive strike. It was just random and over the top.<br /><br />2. The Scylla Massacre - We revisit in the end that it was Shaw that took the first shot and killed a civilian to put down the unrest. But in that take, it seems she is the only person to take out her gun and shoots the woman. No one even knows who those people are related to yet, because they aren't as yet ""lined up against the bulkhead."" No one behind her makes a move, and the XO is still bewildered. Yet the deck is covered in dead civilians. I can follow their logic in making a statement and shooting one person; what I can't figure out is how that turned into a mass execution. And again, it wouldn't have killed someone to include a minor reasoning thought from Cain: ""If we take on these new civilians, we won't be able to feed ourselves. We'll have to leave them. Strip the ships.""<br /><br />3. Gina's Torture - Thanks to the Quizno's Obvious Statement commercials, we know Cain was&nbsp;a scorned, betrayed woman. It's obvious she feels manipulated and the way she instructs Thorne to test ""its"" limits is understandable--it isn't human, and she's pretty sure it can be cracked by using its emotional vulnerabilities. Fine. She probably even knows&nbsp;Thorne is an inhuman bastard and is doing him a favor by giving his sadism an outlet. That kind of thing would be hard to hide on a ship. How that turns into a Please Disturb sign where all the men of the ship are lined up to take a turn with her was completely glossed over. The writers said they deliberately didn't go there after horrifying everyone with Thorne and Boomer earlier, but unleashing one guy on a prisoner is a completely different thing from encouraging an environment of inhumanity on an entire Battlestar.<br /><br />Maybe that's what it degenerated to in the ensuing time before they met up again with the Galactica, but where we left Cain&nbsp;is still solidly in&nbsp;her flowing-locked, misty-eyed days of playing with knives.&nbsp;<br /><br />Overall, it just packed very little punch, other than what we've mostly already seen thanks to the minisodes as to the origins of the hybrids. I ended up caring less about her and wondering more about them...<br /><br />* So the hybrids... they're all originally human?<br />* Are they like the Navigators in Dune that can see and touch time, and this is why they know all about everyone?<br />* Or are they just lunatics?<br />* How did they make the leap from Hybrids to Humlons? Because they're still using Hybrids to fly the ships.<br />* The new Cylons... they're not cloned? They are cloned? They're original designs?<br />* Why do they need more genetic material?<br />* Whatever the answer is for that, why is it important if they finally learned how to procreate?<br />* After all those years, are they seriously still trying to figure out the anatomy of the forearm?<br /><br />The problem is, the Hybrids felt more like a distraction device at the end of a long unsatisfactorially answered question, so will <em>those</em> ever be answered... And if so, will it be in BSG: Bubble Bath?<br /><br />ETA: And one more thing regarding Lee giving the order for Kara to stay behind and blow the nuke--was that supposed to be the beginning of her problem with him, leading to an open door for him to pursue Dee seriously? They were way too cavalier with each other when she returned, even teasing. Rang pretty false for me.<br /></div>"

"event","1.&nbsp;When I spend 15 minutes explaining all that I have to do/cook/clean tonight prior to the meal that will be&nbsp;served at noon tomorrow (noon?!), that is not&nbsp;an&nbsp;opening for you to complain about how you've been doing those very things all day and guilt-trippily ask if I wouldn't&nbsp;like to do something this evening&nbsp;so you can get out of the house. Hello? One of the downsides to family is that everyone takes my ""no"" as a speedbump, temporarily slowing them down until they get what they want.<br /><br />2. Though I'm not hosting Thanksgiving itself, I am hosting a Leftovers Dinner on Friday (not just reheating, but using them in other things) to which my grandparents are coming. They don't like to host this holiday, since they do Christmas, so each year they decide which child they'll visit and just go there. Unfortunately without notice. Personally, I think it's cool, seeing as how we all have plenty of food. Frankly,&nbsp; I think we should just serve the kick-assingest meal, so that they always want to be at our house, and then we win Thanksgiving. My mother disagrees, and is in a tizzy because they were heading our way. Ah, family drama. So anyway, my apartment gets to either be the Neutral Zone or Ground Zero, depending on how it goes down.<br /><br />3. I took out the sweet potatoes to peel and cube. I JUST bought them a couple of days ago, and what do I see. Mold stringing from one of them like Rip Van Winkle's beard, threatening the other spuds. It was very reminiscent of that episode of Swiss Family Robinson when&nbsp;a meteor crashes on the island and starts growing stinging hairs everywhere and killing the goats and whatnot, a reference which I use frequently, belying the childhood trauma it inspired. Fortunately I did peek out from behind the couch to see that water killed the poisonous space&nbsp;strands,&nbsp;so I doused the infected yam with hot water and, voila, it is cured.*<br /><br />*<em>For those of you questioning my cooking safety skills, it is only growing on the skin, which is coming off anyway.</em>"

It is just as exciting as it seems. Except, here's the thing. It's so ""convenient"" that you have to&nbsp;do the following:<br /><br />1. Attend an auditorium orientation<br />2. Take 10 online classes centered on various aspects of the system<br />3. Attend a 2-hour classroom event<br /><br />Anything that takes that long to learn can only lead to evil things.<br /><br />Sometimes I think these systems are designed by the prisoners at Gitmo, who are taking out their revenge on the Capitalistic Satan via applications that are as tortuous as possible. The only thing I can see this doing is sifting out people who are currently doing their own reports and settling it squarely on the secretaries or anyone they consider to be secretary-like. I'm already used to it, thanks to our ordering system which&nbsp;adapts less intuitively&nbsp;every 5 seconds and endangers my soul each time I use it, due to the amount of cursing it inspires.<br /><br />In fact, I think that is part of the talley at the bottom: Items, Amount, Total, Years Incurred in Purgatory. It is now a subpoint under Wrath as Deadly Sin 7A.&nbsp;<br /><br />Apparently&nbsp;this NEW system&nbsp;is so helpful that you have to fill out a new report for each individual receipt and tip.&nbsp;Also, according to&nbsp;our lovely&nbsp;presenter, the system is magical, because it places credit card swipers in all taxis, so we will never have to dirty our hands with out-of-pocket cash again.<br /><br />Yeah, I don't know where SHE takes taxis, but that isn't true for any city I travel in.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, gotta go for now and order some office Christmas cards. If I'm not back in an hour, see you in hell.</p>"

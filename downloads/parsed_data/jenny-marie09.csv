"event","I've had a good couple of days. Sunday I worked during the day, came home, and changed for booth bay. Matt came and picked me up and we got food to go and then we were on the road around 7. we got to the hotel, and relaxed for the night. I ended up drinking that night and ended up getting a lil sick, so the hangover I had the next day wasn't too pleasant. After I was feeling better we went and did some shopping, then went to this italian restuarant for dinner. After dinner we relaxed and watched some movies. This morning we got up and got breakfast which was good, then we were on our way home. 

So the trip was a success. I found out the craziest thing the other night- that one of my good friends from highschool is now dating  a girl. ( and she's a girl.) I have nothing against homosexuals, but it just came out of left field; i never suspected it. as long as she's happy!

talked to my Umass friends today- i think i may be sseeing laura and sarah this weekend so impumped. i miss ashley and hope i see her soon.

matt told me he loved me this weekend for the first time and he was so nervous to do it too, he was so cute about it! love you too matthew!

anyways, im going to wrap this up. im working a double tomorrow, peace."

"event","Hellooo....Work last night was good :) I made decent money in tips which makes me happy. my dad, uncle angelo, trish, and my 2 sisters came in for dinner..my dad complained that his food was nasty but everyone else said theirs were okay! haha. ive never eaten there but all I have really heard is good things, but whatever. After work I put 20$ of gas in my car then I came home and played around on the computer til midnightish. I talked to Matt last night and he had stopped by this girl Sarah's house and didn't initially tell me he was going there..and he has slept with her..and I know he would get mad if he found out later on that I had been hangin out with Christopher, so I got kinda mad but not really. I trust him and everything, so I'm over it. This morning my mom called my cell at 7 am! She did the same thing yesterday too..she was waking me up to wake AMY up cuz amy has to work for the day. She better remember to pay me back the money she owes me!

Anyways, this was a boring entry. I gotta go throw some clothes on and head to the bank and the library in scarborough...then i'm coming home to do laundry, pack, and work out. Booth bay tomorrow :) yay! have a good day everyone"

"event","good afternoon. Worked last night and it was wicked slow, but it didn't make time go by too slow- there were a lot of issues with customers so i was running around all night trying to please everyone. tips sucked too so hopefully tonight will make up for it. I think my family might be coming to the track tonight to eat dinner, which could be cool :) 
this morning i woke up, ate, then went and got my oil changed on my car. matt made me the appointment to get it changed and i didnt want it until next week but whatever. the guys that work there are friends of him; they were pretty cool actually. one of them, carl, called up matt after i left and said i was ""exceptional."" haha. so after leaving there i went to walmart and spent $50 on some stuff i needed. I swear i love that store! i buy so much shit there. its cool though because I save so much money getting simple stuff i need because in rite aid or hannaford its so overpriced. so after walmart I came back to the house and no one was here so I was kinda in a cleaning mode so i re-organized and went through a bunch of shit in my room. then I ran 4.5 miles and sweated my ass off, then took my rotweiler for a walk..then showered...ate a salad..and here i am! i have to leave for work in 20 minutes. its been so friggen hot out today! its rediculous. at 1 when i came home it was 95 degrees outside! i really hope its not bad at the track tonight. if its bad im going to be sweating my ass off which is definitely NOT attractive!
After tonight I only have 2 more days of working which makes me happy- then im off to boothbay! there's a lot of crap i need to get done before then though. Im excited tho, its like a mini vacation :) I heard its really nice up there and we're staying in this wicked nice bed and breakfast that my parents also stayed in 2 weeks ago- its overlooking the ocean. soo i can't wait :)

anyways, im going to wrap this up. i gotta finish doing my hair and then off to the track i go. hope everyone has a good night!

I actually clicked on someone's link in their profile for livejournal and I was like hmm lets see if mine is still there..and it is! I found this on scott's live journal so I stole it, its something cool so what the hell:

. My ex is... my most recent ex (maxwell) is a conforming asshole. 
2. I am listening to...nothing at the moment. 
3. Maybe I should... get off my ass and go work out already!
4. I love... my friends and family.
5. My best friend...is ashley smith, I love that girl to death. 
6. I don't understand... a lot of things in the world.
7. I lose...things way too often. 
8. People say...I look like my mother.
9. The meaning of my screen name is...very basic- its my first and middle name plus my fav. #
10. Love is... unbelieveable, but does suck when it ends
11. Somewhere, someone is...having sex! ow ow!
12. I will always...be a true mainer at heart <3
13. Forever seems... impossible in this day and age.
14. I never want to... become unmotivated & unsuccessful
15. My mobile phone is... very cute- pink and white stripes 
16. When I wake up in the morning... i eat oatmeal then relax for a bit before i exercise. 
17. I get annoyed when...people don't believe me
18. Parties are... wayyy too much fun, especially when im at school! 
19. My fish are... dead, flushed down the toilet :( poor esparagus and angel!
20. Kisses are the worst when...they are slobbery and there is way too much tounge! 
21. Today I... am going to relax before i go to work tonight 
22. Tonight I will... hopefully make some good money in tips!
23. Tomorrow I will... probably do the exact same things i am doing today.
24. I really want... a lot of things! too many to list here!


A lil update on moi- this whole summer i've been working a lot. Tonight I am a manager on duty ( i got promoted yay!) so its going to be a long night tonight. hopefully it will be semi busy, otherwise time is going to pass realllyyy slowly. and i don't want that. I'm really excited for sunday- I am going an hour north in Maine to boothbay harbor with Matt. It should be a good time- it's like the one real trip so far i've actually planned out and followed through with for the summer so far. Trish went in for her ""mapping"" today for her radiation treatments (she has cancer). I think she's being crazy though- she is putting off her radiation treatments until august 8th in order for her to be feeling okay to go to PA for a family reunion and for her to be able to send philip off to college..and my dad and doctor don't think that putting radiation off is a good idea, and neither do I. I mean the family reunion and getting phil ready for college may be important, but she needs to stop being selfish; people want her to start radiation sooner than later, so she will be able to go to more than one friggen family reunion and will be able to see philip off to college next year and the year after that..I don't know..we'll see how things work out with her. I think she is just being stubborn and dumb.


anyways, im going to look over some old journal entrees ( haha) then hop on the treadmill and run ( the weather is shitty outside otherwise i'd be running outside! ) and do all that fun stuff...write later!"

"event","So yeah. Last night I got like no sleep. I ended up waking up twice last night IN THE HALLWAY. Then I woke up and I WAS EATING IN MY SLEEP. I think I have problems lol. I ate a power bar, thank god it wasn't anything tooo unhealthy. Last night I also had dreams that there were lizzards all over my walls and I was running out of the rooom then when I woke up I was in the hall way. That's some fucked up shit let me tell you.

So yeah I was hoping to sleep til like noon today but I was wide awake at 9 am. I don't know why haha it's not like I got any sleep last night! I ate some oatmeal then relaxed. Then I went and asked my dad if he wanted to go running with me and that's when he told me his big news- As of Septmeber 2nd 2005 he is no longer employed. I almost shit myself when he told me that. I mean my dad's a smart man and he's really successful. He didn't get fired. His branch of the company just got cut sooo..they offered him another position but he didn't accept it cuz he said the work there is unethical and too cut throat so I respect his decision. The phone has been ringing off the hook today and yesterday, companies have been calling him so I'm sure he will be okay. Atleast I hope.He's also got a severence pay for a while too so Money won't be an issue just yet. Oh and to all of my friends reading this, keep this info on the DL, thanks. 

So yeah. After my dad told me that I went and ran 3 miles, then showered. Ross came over around 12 and waited for me to get ready. We then went to panera bread for lunch then went to kohl's and bought my mom an 80$ gift certificate there from me and my sisters, then we went to the mall. I picked out ross some clothes- he wouldn't've ever've gotten them if I hadn't been there! He was glad I came and hey it was fun playing dress up with him lol. We then went to pac sun cuz he wanted some new shoes and I ended up buying a new pair of shoes. I got these like ballerina shoes that are suede that are tan, sooo cute. Then we went to Abercrombie. I splurged a little! Not too bad though. I got the cutest capris workout pants- they are hot, can't wait to wear them to school. Then I got a pair of jeans for 30, which was awesome. Then we left the mall after that and then went to the bank so I could deposit money, then we dropped off my perscription for my face, then went and got my car washed. Then I came home and napped for a while- I felt like shit, so I drank some water too. I think I was dehydrated. Then mom came over with Jess and I visited with mom for a while. I ate around 8, then got ready then headed to Chris to hang out with him on one of his last nights here.

I picked him up around 9. He got in the car and he looked adorable tonight. I gave him his present- angels and demons by dan brown, a card, a good bye letter, and then 3 family guy shot glasses. he loved his present. Then we went to the movies tonight. we saw the movie the skeleton key which was a good movie, not too scary. there are some good movies coming out- saw 2 ( saw 1 was awesome) and also this exorcist movie that's based on a true story bout some college chick named emily rose who gets pocessed. Looks good. Then after the movie we went back to his house and hung out. I left around 2. It wasn't sad saying goodbye to him- He was like passing out cuz he had taken some tylenol pm's before hand. but he did thank me for everything and for being a sweetheart and that he was going to miss me. So tomorrow is his last real day here- hes spending the day with his dad and then getting together with some buddies for dinner then heading to bed early, then hes off to ithaca friday early. take care chris!

so yeah. tomorrow i've got the day off again which is awesome. Lizz has the day off. I think we might be heading to amherst to go clubbing with some people, not sure though. It's been nice having time off I love it. I hope we get together tomorrow. But yeah. Steph called me tonight and I missed her call dammit. We need to have a chat. My rents are leaving for the weekend, im happy. It will be good to have some alone time. Alright I took some tylenol pm's tonight so hopefully i will get some GOOD sleep tonight. ciao!"

"event","Good afternoon. Work yesterday sucked, it was really slow. I was about to leave work around 6:30 and some guy came up and had me cash an 800$ ticket, and of course I had like no money in my drawer so I had to keep going to the bank and shit. But he tipped me so it was worth it :) After work I stopped by Erica's and dropped off some CD's for her, that I had burned copies of for myself. Then I went home and the family was celebrating Jessy's birthday. They didn't wait for me to get home so they had already eaten dinner and were already on cake when I got home. So I ate and Jess opened presents then Dad took Jess and Amy back to mom's. Then around 930 Lizz and Erica came and visited for a bit and picked me up. Then we went to Lizze's for a bit and hung out while Lizz ate and changed. Then we dropped Erica over at her friends house then Lizz and I went to Portland and met up with her friends Mike and Adam. They were pretty nice, nothing i'd consider hooking up with or anything lol. One of the kids Mike messaged me and shit and wants to take me out to dinner soon i'm like ahhh why can't I meet a guy I'm interested too? LOL. Hopefully in the fall or sometime this year I'll meet a guy I can date/get involved with. I definitly miss it. 

So this morning I slept in and got up around 10, ate, hung out, did laundry, then around noon I went for a run with dad. It was a good run, didn't stop or anything :-) I'm proud of myself haha. Then we got home and talked some then cleaned up the house a bit, I showered, then left and went to mom's and picked up Jess and Amy and dropped them off at soccer. Now I'm at my moms and i'm hangin out here till I have to work tonight 545-midnight. I hope it isn't slow tonight, otherwise time is going to pass real slow. I got my work schedule yesterday for the week and I work today, tomorrow 12-12!!! Such a shitty day lol. then i've got weds and thursday off, friday i work 545-11, saturday 545-11, and sunday 230-730. I hope I get some good tips tonight and especially tomorrow! I need the money for my mom's birthday coming up this friday. Chris called me this morning, said he called me yesterday cuz he wanted to see me last night, but I had no missed calls, boooo. But yeah Thursday ( his birthday ) he doesn't want to go out or anything cuz friday he has to get up early to leave for NY so we are hangin out wednesday. Last time seeing him, crazy shit. I started writing him this goodbye letter today, gotta wrap this up. And my mom bought him his other part of his birthday present so i've got that all set.

But yeah. I'm ready to go back to school already. Not looking forward to work tonight. I'm hungry so I think i'm going to go make myself some food then just relax till work. I gotta get up tomorrow at 7 am, blah! I've got a dermatologist appointment tomorrow which makes me happy cuz my face needs some help.But yeah I will write later. cya."

"event","Good morning. Yesterday I slept till 11, it was awesome. The night before was messed up- I went to my mom's house and apparently my mom had been at dad's house earlier and they talked. he had a few things to say about me lol. he told my mom that him and her raised a snot (referring to me) and that i was disrespectful and that he's really close to cutting me off for college in december. he also said that he never sees me and apparently he was mad that i missed work to go to the backstreet boys concert. my mom stood up for me there and told me that nonnie had suprised everyone with the tickets so i didn't really have a choice haha. but whatever. so friday night after work i was at mom's house crying. and that night the whole time i was at work i had something stuck in my eye so that didnt help. it hurt to go to sleep that night but i managed. but yeah so yesterday dad didn't say anything bout what he had said to my mom. good thing. i got up and did housework with amy, then amy left for soccer and dad and trish left to go birthday shopping. so i ran 3 miles then since there's no food in my house i went and got a sandwich from panera bread and the fruit and walnut salad from mcdonalds and went to moms house and hung out with my mom til work. it was so hot yesterday, it was grossss. i hope it isn't that hot today. work went well last night- i cashed a 1,500 winning ticket that i sold this lady. i made 30$ in tips last night which made me happy. then after work i went back to mom's house. i didn't go out friday or saturday night this weekend, kinda sucks, but whatever. i left lizz messages to hang out but she never got in touch with me. still haven't heard from torie. darcy called me last night when i got out of work and i think she lied to me cuz she said she was home and that she wasn't going out but she had been on the phone with dan earlier and so they probably hung out. i don't know i don't care if they hang out, there's just no need for her to lie ya know. but whatever. i hung out at moms til like 1130 then came home. talked to chris online last night- he gave me shit cuz i didnt call him friday night when i was upset cuz of what my dad had said to my mom. then i said somethin bout how i need to go back to school cuz my dad's had enough of me and he's like i don't think anyone could get enough of you/ or sick of you or something then a wink face. then i said yes they could and he said he couldn't. haha whatever. i love how i like analyze everything he says. whatever haha. he leaves for school on thursday. i don't know when we're hangin out so we'll see. today is jessy's 16th birthday. i think we're celebrating a dinner type thing for her tonight cuz i work 230- whenever, ill prob. be home by 6-7ish. i swear someone knocked on my door this morning to wake me up so i got up and ate and no one is here! lol. i don't know. but yeah im going to wrap this up cuz im going to hang out for a bit then prob. work out,shower, then off to work i go. talk later."

"event","Hello! today was a decent day. I was really angry this morning because my dad made me get up around 9 to feed and walk the dog which pissed me off cuz I was like 1/2 asleep and he usually does it but whatever. So I did that then ate some breakfast cuz i was like starving then went and relaxed and bed and read some more of my glamour ( thats taking me forever to read cuz its like 2 inches thick lol) then eventually passed out. Woke up around 1130, and got online. darcy called me and we talked about what happened on her birthday which was interesting cuz she had a totally different story then lizz but whatever haha. so then we made plans to go run errands together but she never called me after she showered so i called up erica and we went. so around noon i ran, showered, then took care of tucker cuz philip is a lazy ass and doesnt do anything with the dog. so then i went to lucindas and got a brochure bout their massages and stuff cuz i want to get my mom a certificate for her birthday, then i picked up erica and we went to walmart. i got 2 frames for the collages im making jenn and rachel for their birthdays, chris a birthday card, and myself a pretty new belly ring. then we went to best buy and i got jessy the other part of her birthday present- fall out boy's cd ( which i am sooo burning myself a copy of before a head to school ) and i also bought the all american rejects new cd which rocks! it reminds me of christopher but thats okay. then we went to spencers and i got part of his birthday gift- some family guy shot glasses which are wicked cute. also bought 2 posters for my dorm room- a sexy one of orlando bloom and then a pretty corona one. and i got a lil nail filer just cuz i needed one. its cute. then we went to panera bread and i got food to go cuz i never have dinner anymore at home, which was yummy. it sooo hit the spot :) then i got ready then headed to pierre and cathy's house. we waited for mom and amy and deanna ( they were late of course ) then we headed to the civic center. 

the concert was sweet! some chick opened she was pretty good but no one had heard of her. then the click 5 preformed and they were adorable. they were all dressed in suits and their cd is coming out next week so i might get it. they reminded me of the beatles. then came the backstreet boys! the show was awesome, they always put on a good show. they had this cool slide show going when they were backstage changing and i saw clips from the first concert i saw them in at the fleet center! they played some old stuff and some new. i only knew 2 of their new songs but i definitly want to get their new album. but yeah it was definitly a good show and we all had a good time. now i am home. ive got work tomorrow blah and i definitly don't want to go. i like not working lol and bein lazy. martina called my mom today at work and she wants me to work a double shift on friday which blows ass. i have to go in at 130, boo. i had a nail appointment scheduled for 1 so i guess i can't go to that. oh well. but yeah i just got kicked off aim so im going to try to get back on for a bit then im probably heading to bed, so ill write later, ciao!"

"event","Haven't written for a while I apologize. this weekend ross's parents were gone so lizz and i hung out there friday and saturday night. we had a good time partying. but besides that ive been busy working and shit. Yesterday during the day Brian from Umass came up and we hung out. we went to the old port and found this cool used book store and got some great deals. we also got lunch at applebees. it was good seeing him! then i worked last nite, which was alright. made a decent amount of money in tips. two guys complimented me last night- one wanted to take me out to dinner and said i looked like nicky taylor; the other said i looked like barbara strysand which was interesting cuz shes older haha but whatever. so yesterday was darcys birthday and lizz called me and invited me to hang out w/ them but i couldnt go cuz of work but apparently that night was all fucked up- darc ditched everyone who got together to celebrate for ian! she cheated on dave apparently so i dont know whats going on there. brian and rory drove like 45 mins to come hang out w/her so they were mad. then she blew me off today! crazy bitch lol. 

so today- i got up and had a list of shit i had to do on the counter which pissed me off cuz it was my day off. i was very productive today which made me happy but heres what i did- got up ate breakfast, attempted to do my waiver for health insurance online, did some financial shit, cleaned three fish tanks, vaccumed upstairs, did a load of laundry, cleaned my room, the bathroom, vaccuumed the first floor, cleaned the counters, took care of the dog, vacuumed my car, ran 3 miles, showred, then got ready lol. oh and i also finished a collage for jessys birthday. BLAH. chris came and picked me up around 6 and we went to two lights for dinner. we went to this like fried seafood place cuz he wanted to go there lol. it was alright i got a good lobster roll, had some coleslaw and fries. thank god i worked out today. i didnt eat much tho so now im hungry but im not going to eat before i go to bed. after dinner we walked around on the rocks then headed back to his place and just relaxed, gave eachother massages. it was an early night cuz he has to work early tomorrow. he leaves on august 19th- day after his birthday.im going to get him a book he wants to read- angels and demons by dan brown. i talked him into reading the da vinci code so i think this will be a good gift. i can't believe he's leaving its crazy. hes all excited to go which he should be- i mean hes a smart kid and he's going to do well, i know it. i will miss him. its going to be hard being home with him already off to college. i mean his house is like 2 mins from mine and there are memories we've made like all over the place. its crazy. every little thing reminds me of him.and im going to be jealous if he's with other girls. and who knows if ill ever see him again- i mean im jealous cuz he's got great friends at home and im sure he'll have great ones at school. he's got the best of both worlds. my friends at home are okay,but not the best. i love my umass friends to death but it just sucks when im not with them cuz i get pretty lonely. 

anyways- no work tomorrow again for me! my mom is going to call me out cuz she suprised me with tickets to go see the backstreet boys. im kinda excited-i haven't seen them since i was 11 in the 7th grade. and i know all their songs so it's going to be a good time. my mom, me, my little sister amy, her friend deanna, and my aunt cathy are all going together to the shoew. im excited! but yeah i got a new glamour magazine that i want to go read then im heading to bed- night!"

so basically lately all i have been doing is working. ive hung out with lizz and darcy a few times. a few days ago a bunch of us got together and went to the beach. lizz was being a bitch that night but hey whats new haha. i haven't seen chris in a week. we made plans to hang out this past weds. and he texted me and said he couldn't hang out cuz he had to get up at 530 am the next day and then we were going to hang out tonight and again he had to get up early. so i think im going to stop tryin because he's obviously not trying to see me. i am done- this past week i have been the one calling and trying to make plans so whatever. who knows maybe me not seeing him is for the better. even though i do like hangin out with him but maybe it will be better so it won't be that bad when he leaves for school. last time we hung out he told me that he was GLAD he dumped me- i cried when i left his house. that hurt soo bad, like wow i was so hurt.hes like yeah i was so tempted when id go to parties and see the hot soccer players and they'd be like omg chris ur so hot blah blah blah..yeah that was exactly what i wanted to be hearing. so yeah i left his house and cried. and i haven't seen him since.

nothing real exciting going on in my life at this time. no new love interets, nothing. i need to call some of my umassers and catch up with them. i haven't talked to steph since she left my house last week haha. my mom is buying a new car which is exciting. she is getting A 2005 honda civic, automatic, silver. woot woot. its pimping.

anyways, im going to wrap this up. ill write later and i promise to be more vigorious with my entries.ciao."

today- slept till 10, ate breakfast, worked out ( i started back up ) then showered then went to my moms house. i looked through my stuff in my room- i have to take some of my stuff out because she is moving. it was kinda depressing cuz some of my stuff was ruined but oh well.

After I called work we went to the lake, and it was GORGEOUS yesterday. We were out on the water from 12-5. We got lunch at frye island, this lil restaurant, and it was wicked good. I got this awesome steak sandwich with a salad. Yumm. Then we cruised around the lake for the rest of the day. I didn't end up seeing Christopher and he didn't see me either..hmm. When we were eating some drunk guy didn't tie his boat down good enough and it drifted into my dads and he got mad. 

Anyways, after the boat we came home for a bit, then I got a phone call from my mom. She was at pierre and kathy's for a cookout for the 4th of july. so jess and i went over there. it wasn't too bad- we were there for only an hour. Nonnie made some good strawberry shortcake :-) dad let me and jess take the audi TT over to pierre's and i love driving it! its awesome. i just drive it and i feel HOT. we took a pic of me driving it yesterday and its a cool pic. my moms car blew up yesterday which sucks for her cuz she cant really afford something like that right now..poor mommy.


when we got home dad wanted some icecream and i was sick of driving so dad and jess went to beals and bought pints of icecream. it was yummy. then we just relaxed till dad went to bed around 10. then i came down here online and uploaded the pics and just talked to people till like 1ish. 


now it is the morning. dad went golfing with philip this morning. i got up semi-early cuz i need to start working out again since i haven't done much since i was in the ER. alright im going to wrap this up- hope everyone has a good 4th and i will write later :-)"

"event","hello! it is really gross out today, but its a good break from the hot weather. yesterday i was like sweating when i was getting ready for work! so i got up with the intentions of working out but that didn't happen..i ended up fallin asleep again. then trish and i went and got some lunch then walked the beach for a bit, then picked up jess at school. i then went to grammy and buckys and they told me bout katie ( cuz today and tomorrow i am watching her, i actually am spending the night at their house tonite) then i came back and showered then went to work. i worked 545-1210. work wasn't bad- i worked with this girl named amy, she seemed cool. when i got out of work around midnight ashley smith was there, and we talked for a bit. i came home and slept till 730 this morning- got up and did a quick work out, showered, did a load of laundry, then had a nail appointment at 10 am. i got up so early and did all this crap cuz torie wanted to hang out after my nail appointment, then she calls me during the nail appointment and tells me that she is going to physical therapy then out to lunch with sue so she said she was going to call me after she got done that and she didnt call me till 230, while i was sleeping. so i called her back around 3 and she didnt answer so i left her a message. so i dont know. matt curran came over today, and he told me he just wanted to hook up with me so he got here he was a lil all over me, but not really, but it was still weird. i dont know- when he was leaving i told him that im sorry if i dissapointed him if he thought by hangin out with me he meant that he was going to get laid lol. oh well..might've been a lil mean there but whatever. 

tonight- no work, sushi with matty benoit, woot woot. my brother is a fucker- giving me attitude, complaining he has school! aww boo hoo go suck a dick- he doesnt want to do anything for the dog or pick up jessy so hes a homo i really hope he doesnt go to umass cuz if he does i will transfer."

"event","Good evening. SO for the rest of the day yesterday I basically hung around, didn't do much. I ended up eating some lunch, walking tucker, then sleeping off and on from 1-3 pm. People kept calling me which kept interrupting my sleep! Roar. I was getting frusturated. I got up around 3 and was still exhausted- I wanted to go get some more sleep. I showered, then off to work I went. Work was crazy busy! I almost ended up crying, a few guys were getting me really stressed out. I seriously wanted to quit right then and there but I didn't. So I worked til 10:30, then Ash had said she wanted to hangout with me, so I called her up and she was at Nate's house ( obviously- where else would she be?). So I asked her what she was doing and she said she was there and I asked her if she wanted to hangout and she didn't really say much ,but she was like Jenny I'm not like Darcy, I don't blow off my friends for guys. Soo but in the end she ended up blowing me off and staying at Nate's so I came home and relaxed then went to bed.

Today- got up around 1030, I was awoken cuz Jess and Mom were outside my window talking, so when I got up I went out and visited with mom for a bit. Then I came back in and showered, then went to my re-scheduled job interview at Michael's. The interview was short- They asked about me and college and then didn't want to finish interviewing me so tht was a waste of time. SO then I went and picked up Mom and Amy, and then we went to Sams and picked up some film that we got devloped and dropped more off, then we also got these designer travel bags ( kenneth cole! woot woot) which was awesome. Then we went to panera bread. As we were walking in we saw Chris's ex ( the one before me) Vanessa and she gave me the dirtiest look ever- I was like wtf lol. Oh well. Lunch was good! I love panera. Then we went over to Deb's- we ended up spending a lot of time there. I got 2 new bathing suits! I got this cute pink one, a light colored pink, with palm trees on it. I also got this brown, light blue, and white one- very hot. I also got a pair of jeans on clearance, and some thongs. Then we went over to walmart and got some toilitrees I needed, and also some comfy lime green capris and some spandex work out capris. I also got this sexy bra that was on clearance which was pretty sweet. Then after that I drove them home then back to Gorham I went. I had been callin Ash all day and we were playing phone tag. I ate with Trish ( we had salads) then talked to Ross and he said he was going to the movies with his friends and wanted to know if I wanted to go with him so I said sure, so I asked Torie, Ash, and was planning on asking Lizz to go. I talked to Torie and she said she neeeded sleep so that was cool; I called Lizz at 8:30 and she said she would call me back and never did, which was gay; then I called Ash and she said she was going to come, and that was at 8:45, then at 9:30 when Ross and I were leaving I called her ( she didn't have the decency to call me), and she said her mom wasn't letting her go, blah blah blah...SO basically I got blown off lol. Which sucked. So Ross and I go over to the Windham cinema and its closed! So his friends take off and we decide to go to friendly's and get some icecream then to come back here and hang out. We were planning on watching a movie, but I got online and he got playing on  my laptop, so we got distracted and didn't end up doing much. Soo yeah my night basically sucked, oh well my day was good. I talked to Darcy tonight and she wants to hang out Tuesday before she goes to work so we'll see if that happens. Blaah tonight got me mad- makes me not want to be home anymore. Hopefully things will change. Ash is now online talking to me, acting like everything's cool- whatever. I think I should just get a bf and be like okay if all three are you are going to continue to blow me off for your guys then fuck I'll do it too.

Anyways, got my work schedule for this week, the only day I have completely off is Tuesday. I think Matty Benoit and I are going out for sushi that night which makes me happy :-) I have a long shift tomorrow- 545 pm- midnight,blahh. I better rest up!! Haha.Alright time to wrap this up I am headin to bed soon- ciao."

"event","Goood morning. Yesterday I showered and then Ross came over and took the top off my jeep and then we headed to OOB. The beach was awesome! It was really nice out, I loved it. I got a lil burnt though, but its a tan today, so its all good. We got subway and some coolattas while we were at OOB. After the beach we went down to the tattoo place in Gorham. I got my nose stud changed; I like the new one I have in now better. Jessy got her belly button pierced. She almost passed out HAHA it was kinda funny. She like HATES needles with a passion. So after that, I came home and Jess and I had to clean the entire house. So then Trish brought home dinner ( she has stopped cooking, its kinda annoying ) and then I sat and talked with my dad for a bit. Trish got pissed at me cuz my dad was like "" Phil might be going to Umass "" and I said 
"" i hope not. "" and trish got REALLY angry. Whatever, I don't want him going to Umass, it's like my school, ya know what I mean? I mean I know how it would be if we went to the same school- he'd expect me to drive his ass around, get him beer, tell him about parties, etc. It's not cool. And I know with rides and stuff home I would have to base me going home around his schedule- which isn't cool. I talked to my dad bout possibly transferring and he said I could transfer if I wanted to my junior year, so we'll see what happens with that. Anyways, so for the remainder of the night I ended up heading back to the beach. I went for a walk there, it was nice. I came home around 11:30 cuz I was so tired- the sun tuckers me out. I had a belly ache too which sucked :-(

Soo today I want to go running, vaccuum my car...I've got a nail appointment today at 12:15 that I kinda don't want to go to, just because it's like in the middle of the day which sucks ass. Blaah- I better get started on my errands! Ill ttyl! ciao"

"event","Good morning! Yesterday was kinda a waste of a day. I slept for 11 hours straight- I was so tired from CT. So I got up around 11, worked out, ate, walked the dog, etc. I got subway around 4 to eat before work cuz there isn't any food in my house. Work went okay- It was my first night on by myself. I worked with the money well- I wasn't under :-) Which makes me happy. Some guys were assholes though and were SO impatient. So I am hoping it get's better, otherwise I am going to have to get a new job. But I'm sure I'll be alright. I didn't get out of work till Midnight! So late. I was going to meet up with Rossy but It was wayy too late. I went and got some chill from Wendys when I got out- it was soo good. It so hit the spot. So now I am up semi-early today. I woke up this morning cuz hot air was spewing into my room through the fan. I am going to the beach today i think! I am so excited, I'm going to be nice and tan 8-) woot woot. I have to borrow jessy's bathing suit though, cuz I don't have any for this summer yet. I found this one she has from target- I tried it on this morning and it looked decent haha so I am going to wear it. 

Last night I talked to Giba for like an hour. He is coming to Maine tomorrow! I left dad a note last night asking him bout Giba coming and he said it was okay! I have work tomorrow night til like 10:30 so i think he's going to be getting here in Maine right around when I will be getting out of work, so it will work out nicely. I haven't seen him in almost a month! I have to work thursday night though, I might call out so I can hang out with him, we'll see what I end up doing. Anyways, I think I am going to go shower and get ready for the beach! woot woot! I might actually clean out my car HAHA- ahh its so gross. Anyways, cya! ciao!"

"event","Hello again! My sister decided to be a stalker and look for me on livejournal and found my account, so I figured hey what the hell, I might as well start updating you again. Today I got back from CT around 5. Last night me and my Umassers partied! We celebrated Stephy's 19th birthday, it was a good time. Stephy got really drunk- she got sick this morning :-/ Which sucked. It was soo good seeing all my friends again! :-) I loved it. It was like we never left school- we all got back into the groove of being at Umass, and being together again. Rachel and Johnny were acting a lil distant from everyone, but whatever. I ended up talking to steph's boyfriend for her last night- She wanted me to say some things to him. She was mad that he didn't care that she was crying. So there was a lil bit of drama last night. I also called Giba last night and ended up crying cuz I wanted him to come to the party, and nope he didn't end up showing up. Which sucked cuz he LIVES IN CONNECTICUT. Oh well, he says he's coming to Maine this week so we'll see what happens. He says that I'm his girl and all this shit, but I don't know- I told him that I need reassurance (well EVERY girl does) that he's into me, and so I'm glad I told him that. I got it off my chest. I need to talk to him again sometime tonight or tomorrow, cuz last night we both weren't sober lol. Ahh oh well. Tonight I think I'm going to stay in and relax- I only got like 4 good hours of sleep last night. Tomorrow I've got work, boooo. It's going to be interesting- it's my first night with out my trainer guy John, so we'll see how it goes. Hopefully some men will give me tips cuz you know I need the money :-) alrighty im going to get going now, I shall talk to you later!"

I slept till like 12 then got up and showered and woke up steph, and then curly haired stef drove us to the laundromat where we were for like 2 hours. we did 3 huge loads of laundry while stef and joe went and got their hair cuts. then we got back to campus and we all got ready and a big group of us went to north hampton for dinner. dinner was awesome, it was a really good italian resturant. we came back herre and started drinking round 12, hung out w/ some people on the floor also. i went out to ja and then while i was there i got sick....:( not fun. some girl took care of me and i thank her for that. i came back here and went to bed around 2.

Chris called me while I was gettin ready to go to the doctor's this afternoon..it was weird cuz i was talking to trish bout us and as soon as we hung up he called..hmm kinda ironic. he was just calling to see how i was doing, and ill be honest, i was suprised to have heard from him. my doctors appointment went well- the blood cultures all came back negative, but the doc. doesnt think i should go back till sunday, which kinda sucks but whatever. so after the appointment i came home and relaxed for a while...watched some tv and talked to dad for a bit. then my mom and amy and her friend diana came and picked me up around 530. we then went over to the mall in search of a present for my dad. well we ended up shopping in macys ( i got a pair of jeans and a sweater) then we finally entered the mall and i went to abercrombie just to browze and ended up spening 186$ lol. I think i deserve it tho! ive had a rough week. i spent 80$ on a pair of jeans, woot woot, and i also got 4 shirts, not too bad. i finally found a gift for my dad at prints plus- this framed pic of babe ruth for the play room. i also bought a new cell phone cover tonight, and i got some new lotion from bath and body works and some new lip gloss. then we all went to orange julius and got smoothies and shared a pretzel :) it was nice hangin out w/ them again. i've definitly missed my lil sis. oh and we all got redsox hats haha, im wearing it now- its a winter hat, wicked cute.

after the  mall we dropped off diana then my mom went to pick up jess at a friends and amy and i watched the grinch. i stayed there till 11 watching that then mom drove jess and i home. and now im home. on the way home i texted chris, which i dont know if it was a good idea or not..but i said...""sorry to bug you , but i just wanted to let you know that i miss you :-( sorry if thats not what u wanted to hear but i had to tell ya."" blah i dont know if that was dumb of me or not cuz i haven't heard back from him. i mean ive been doing a lot of thinkin and i think its dumb for us to end it over the simple fact that chris doesn't want to make the effort to drive to mass to see me...blah i dont know. maybe i just need to move on..i just dont like having this feeling that we're ruining something for no reason..ive been sad today and its not fun..i miss my boy..


enough with my crying lol..dan invited me over to hang out so i think im headin over there..it will be good to talk to him ( cuz i really haven't talked to any one about this) and hang out cuz i haven't seen him since this summer. ciao."

I come home to see Chris and my family and I get sick with a ""viral infection"" which like leaves me feeling wicked shitty for a couple of days, then wednesday I go to the ER and I find out ive got pneumonia, and then thursday, chris breaks up with me. My week couldn't get any more shittier but whatever. I just want to go back to school. Last night Chris and I were talking online for like 2 hours...and he kept saying he loved being w/ me and cared about me, yet he can't make the time/effort to come to Mass to see me..so that's why we broke up. And he cried last night also. Makes me sad. I am sad. I come home and i'm returning to school w/ pneumonia and no b/f..I lost a boy who I really cared about..blah...here come the tears again. 

Anyways, today i've got a doctor's appointment at 1 I think just a check-up and they are going to tell me the results of the blood culture they did wednesday when I was at the ER, to see if i have any bacteria in my blood. Hopefully tonight when trish gets home or something we'll be able to leave  the house and go shopping or something cuz i'm just like dying to get out of this house...i gotta get dad a birthday present anyways, so yeah im going to go shower, ill ttyl..ciao."

"event","Howdy. So yesterday morning I was awake from 4 to like 7 am coughing my asss off..had 102* fever..and couldn't stop crying. I was miserable. So around 645 I called my mom and told her how I felt and she told me to talk to my dad and figure out if I was going to go back to school or not that day. So 10 minutes later my dad came downstairs to bring Jess to school and he said he didn't think I should be going back to school so he said he was going to call the dean of u-mass when he got to work. SO he called an hour later and the dean had sent out an e-mail to all of my professors. So I ended up taking some more meds and going asleep until 12. Then at 12 I got up and Trish made me some soup, then I went on the couch and Deb Petty ( the lady who's kids I babsat for all this summer ) came over cuz she's a nurse and just wanted to listen to my breathing..and she did..and she said she couldn't hear the air in my right lung, and she suggested that we go to the emergency room. So we did. We were there for like 6 hours. It was a pain in the ass. I'm glad that we went tho, because the doctor here was much better than the ones at mercy quick care. They did a lot of tests to me- they drew my blood twice, one for a blood count, mono test and something else, and another for bacteria cultures, which I wont hear about till tomorrow probably. They also did a chest xray, and this is where they found out that I have pnemonia. lovely. Then they also did this test for meningitis- where they got fluid outof my lower back in my spine. They also put an IV on me for that. The spinal thing wasn't too bad cuz he first gave me a shot there that made it all numb. So we left the ER around 9:00 pm. Crazy shit. Now i'm home. I missed a bio exam yesterday and I've got to talk to my professor and see when he will let me make it up. I talked to all of myother TA's and they are all really supportive of me and me getting better and having the work come second. SO that's good. Just sucks that i've got pnemonia...blah. Looks like i'm going to have a pretty laid-back weekend ahead ofme..not that that's a bad thing, but I think its good. I think i'm heading back to school on Sunday. I want to try to get there early so I can get some work done for monday and such. oh well. Alright now i'm goin to go get some reading/highlighting done for anthropology so i will ttyl. ciao."

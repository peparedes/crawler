"event","i have a question for all you tablet/e-readers...which do you think is better, the nook tablet or the kindle fire?  i received the nook tablet for christmas but ended up returning it (unopened) because i couldn't decide between the nook or the fire.  if any of you own either one, or know a lot about these things, i would appreciate any advice.

i am partial to the fire because i know amazon has a much larger offering than b&n and the ebooks seem to be cheaper.  i am interested in loading my own movies (at least some) onto the device and will mostly use it to watch videos (netflix, most likely).  the thing i like about the nook is the extensive memory vs. the fire (and the added 32GB SD card slot- i figure this will aid in my being able to load more of my own movies onto the device).  

i don't plan on storing any music on the device, nor many ebooks (at the most, 5).  mostly interested in web browsing and watching video.  so, give me ADVICE!!"

"event","well, here it is, weeks after my last post proclaiming that my new year's resolution would be to continue writing in my livejournal.  what a joke.  i guess this is in part due to my recent switch-of-attention to facebook.  i don't know.  could be pure laziness, too.

not much new has happened.  waiting for another holiday to rear its ugly head and pass by.  spending it with jason and his family (well, his mom, brother, brother's fiance, and fiance's little boy), as well my family at some point.

right now i am facing the unlikely (in my head) prospect of going into treatment for my ed- a residential treatment center called laurel hill inn.  i attended their day program a few years back and got kicked out for not liking the brand of yogurt they purchased for breakfast.  long story i won't get into here.

anyway...

looking forward to seeing my pal, laura (ventana on lj) sometime, too, during her visit back home.  well, that's it from my end.  jason is starting to chat with me now, so i'll end this here.  more updates soon...i promise!!"

i'm alive still.  been involving myself with facebook lately and have pretty much ignored livejournal for too long.  i miss it here.  i miss reading my friends' posts.  my new plan is to check livejournal and leave updates at least once every couple of days.  again, i am also on facebook (kristina lombardi) and would love some more friends!

as for things, they're still going (i guess).  took a semester off from school to focus on my health (waiting to see if i get into yet another program).  moved to the next town over.  still with jason.  yadda yadda yadda.  

hope all of you are healthy and happy.  looking forward to getting back into the lj swing of things and reconnecting with all of you.

"event","since my lj lovah nudged me (hi shannon!!), i guess i'll write a little update.  not much happening except for school, school, and more school, but i'll try to oblige.

i'm on page 33 of my thesis- should be done in about five more pages.  then i have to calculate the results of the questionnaires.  35 15-page questionnaires.  eep!

i got to see my good friend, laura <lj user=""ventana""> twice this past week (hadn't seen her in about 2-3 years).  it was great!  she is so stylish these days- so much fun to shop with!  she got to meet jason which was cool.  we talked about jason and i going to visit her and luke sometime soon, which would be super fun.  not sure if that would convince jason to move to california with me, but oh well.  

had a tough afternoon.  emotionally.  stress related to school and whatnot.  haven't heard from my parents since easter (don't know what that's about).  hope everything is okay.  

ugh...busy week ahead.  i was supposed to have a consultation for that new visian icl vision correction surgery, but, at $3,500 an eye, i figured what's the point.  i will, however, be researching that prk thing, as they said i would be eligible for that.  we'll see.  i HAVE to get rid of these damn contacts, that's for sure.

tuesday i have a therapy appointment, wednesday evening i have class.  thursday afternoon i have a doctor's appointment, friday i have a nutritionist appointment (my second one- not so optimistic, but we'll see), and saturday i have a new class, ""addictions,"" which runs from 9-6.  i will be DEAD after that class.  i took a class with this professor before, but the class was from 1-6.  i barely made it through that class.  arghh...

"event","since i was nudged (and because i have no excuse other than school, really, for my lack of entries), i thought i'd drop a line.  oh, i'm also on page 2 of writing my 60-page masters thesis and i'm in stuck-mode at the moment.

nothing very new happening in my life.  just started classes yesterday.  i am taking professional seminar II and an addictions course which, thankfully, doesn't start until april.  i had originally signed up for this class that meets tonight (and every thursday from 6-8:30), but decided i just didn't want to trek out into the snow every thursday night.  good reason, huh?  this winter is just hell- it's been a while since we've had a winter like this.

anyway...i am excited that i will be seeing the cure again in may with jason!  that will surely be fun.  good seats, too, that i nabbed at a fair price from some guy on craigslist.  we had tried to get tickets to the magnetic fields show (feb 13 or 14) but were unsuccessful as i'm sure many people were (there must have been a few dozen posts asking for tickets and offering $$$ for them).  

still unemployed.  i guess it's okay since i am in school part-time, but i've really been feeling kind of inadequate as a human being lately because of it.  the thing is, i am over-qualified for most of the positions i apply for and so i end up in no-man's land.  as such, i've been killing myself over this thesis project.

wish i could go to classes at the cambridge campus; i'm not a huge fan of lawrence, and i heard the courses in cambridge are so much better (and that they have more choices).  i am also kind of sick of living in this apartment, or apartment-dwelling in general.  i am swimming in debt as it is with all my school loans, so i am literally living day by day on social security and school loans.  i am hoping my living arrangements will change soon (who knows...it'll be a year for jason and i in july; yeah, he's got morals).

wow...surprised i was able to get this much written.  i really wish i could get back into the lj swing of things- i miss reading my friends' posts; i used to be so on top of that (read every single morning, first thing).  i will try my hardest to get back into the groove, as time permits.

because i promised myself i would get some reading done for school tonight, this entry won't be long, but i wanted to mention my difficulties lately with the eating disorder and depression.  i am about to go insane.  i have had my eating disorder now for 15+ years and for the past 10 or so years, have eaten the same things for breakfast, lunch, dinner....it's numbing me to death.  i am not on the right medications.  i have been giving some thought to maybe taking a short medical leave after the summer's semester (school) and going to cedc (cambridge eating disorder center).  i have been for numerous consultations but never entered any of their programs.  my eating disorder is not acute in terms of not being medically stable, but it is taking a toll on my mental health and wellbeing, as well as affecting my social life, something i didn't have before because of the ed.

has anyone here been to cedc (i should be posting this to ed_recovery), and if so, how was it?

went to the psychiatrist yesterday and as usual, it was a waste of time.  they (psychiatrists) are all the same- some man in a tweed suit poised over a prescription pad waiting restlessly to scribble something down once you've finished your tirade about how you've been feeling.  my thing is analogies.  i rock with analogies.  i told him i sometimes feel as though my mind is rotting away like acid eating away a battery.  that's the depression feeling.  comes and goes.  <br><br>

anyway, he recommended three options: increasing my zoloft (surprise, surprise!), splitting the zoloft in half and taking one in the morning, one in the afternoon, or trying 5-htp which is supposedly this herbal supplement that facilitates the production of seratonin.  i picked up a bottle at wild oats, an earthy crunchy grocery store in andover, and i popped my first pill this afternoon.  didn't notice anything, but i guess that's to be expected.  if nothing else, it will feel super special knowing i have an herb picked in africa working on my seratonin uptake.<br><br>

received some semi-disturbing news today.  my 28-year-old cousin is engaged to this woman he's been living with for a few years.  she's 36 and has two kids.  he was engaged to be married to his old girlfriend, jenn (this woman's name is jenn as well), a few years back and called it off a month before the wedding.  oh well.  as long as he's happy.  <br><br>

got this really good cd set, ""getting unstuck"" with pema chodrin, an ordained tibetan buddhist nun.  that's what i am burning a copy of now for my therapist.  it's funny, our relationship- monika and i.  it's more like we're colleagues or something- lol.  we recommend books (psychology) to one another and e-mail one another almost every day.  i'm so lucky to have her in my life.  <br><br>

i ended up getting the nano, my original plan.  about an hour after i placed the online order, i was browsing epinions.com and came upon a valued reviewer's plea to consumers to purchase the 30GB ipod over the nano.  makes sense, too, as the 30GB ipod was a mere $20. more than the itty bitty 4GB nano that i purchased.  when i went to the apple store this afternoon to look for a case for it, i was told that apple no longer sells accessories for the first generation nanos.  nifty.  not that i would have purchased it there (complete rip-off).  i ended up getting one from one of those annoying vendors with the carts parked in the middle of the mall.  <br>

i have been in bed the majority of the day.  when i got home from work, around 12:30, i ate lunch and then took a 2-hour nap.  went to the mall, came home, ate what i could because of my jaw pain, and slept another couple of hours.  i am typing this in bed.  i hope i sleep tonight."

"event","i recently sold my 3rd generation ipod (15GB) and got $125. for it.  i realize, after the fact, that this was stupid.  my main reason for selling my ipod was to get the nano, as i like the portability of it versus my old, heavy, clunky ipod.  <br>

so, i found the nano for a good price ($179. for 4GB, 1st generation--i don't like the new titanium ones).  but the 30GB regular, video, ipod is selling for only $20. more on the same site.  what should i do?  i know i don't need 30GB-worth of space, but the thought that i could have 26 GB more and the movie/video option (which brings up another thing) for only $20. more makes me re-think things.<br>

i don't believe i will be downloading movies from the apple itunes site ($9.99 per movie?  umm, no thanks).  i scoured the web for other sources for downloading movies, and found a few one-time-payment subscriptions out there (though they don't let you see the variety of movies until you are a member).  i still don't feel like i would have a huge desire to watch full-length movies on a 2.5"" screen.  i would, however, love to watch music dvds on the ipod, but itunes music store doesn't seem to have any of these (yet).  i asked <lj user=thenetimp> about whether one could somehow get something from a dvd and transfer it to the ipod, and he said it would be a very involved process.  <br>

"event","oh god.  yesterday, i happened to notice the ""check engine"" light go on (again) in my car.  for those of you who haven't kept up with my car news: since i hit 100,000 miles in october, i have spent well over $1,000 on my car (4 new tires, o2 sensor, muffler, front and rear brakes, starter...).  well, having some time this morning, i decided to bring it to the monroe i usually take it to for oil changes.  let me cut to the chase: i need a new catalitic (spelling?) converter.  price, including installation?  $890.  fuck. me. hard.<br><br>

of course, i am beyond frustrated and pissed at my car (can you be pissed at inanimate objects?).  ever since the first repair in october, my dad has been harping to me that these kinds of repairs are normal at the 100,000 mile mark.  after each repair, he has repeated himself, each time with a tad less conviction in his tone, that my best bet is to keep paying for these repairs rather than be insane and think about getting another (new/used) car.  i am definitely NOT in the financial place to even think about buying a car, new or used.  the fact i have the one i have is because of my grandmother who doled out $$ for it for a graduation gift.  this means no car payments all these years.  <br><br>

interesting, though, today, when i called my dad and told him how much this repair would be, his buying-another-car-is-insane speech held less conviction.  as it is, the car has 108,000 miles on it.  is it even worth $890. to fix??  how many miles left on it should i expect?  my car is a 99 nissan sentra limited edition, 1.6 liter.  if anyone can give me some wise advice, i'm all for it.  pulling into a gas station and crying was not a fun way to start the day.  :-/"

"event","i know this is a shock, me posting to my journal, as i have been very slack in the new year.  i apologize for that.  i do appreciate all my lj friends keeping me as a friend and i do want you to know that i have been reading lj here and there to try and keep up-to-date with all of you.  <br><br>

been having a very difficult time of late.  who am i kidding- my whole life has been rather unpleasant, for the most part (at least as far back as i can remember, there has been something for which i was sent to a therapist for--if it wasn't separation anxiety in elementary school, it was depression in high school when my parents read into the whole writing-in-my-journal-by-candlelight-on-a-saturday-night activity to mean i wanted to kill myself.  nevermind what was written in said journal/s.<br><br>

*sigh*  i'm at work right now.  yesterday, the dryer broke while i was trying to catch up on the mountains of laundry that had piled up over the week (evidently, they were giving away free massages or something on wednesday, my one day off, for all i know).  let me tell you- it is not a pleasant activity hauling a laundry bin on wheels, full of sopping wet laundry across rte. 1 in new hampshire to the laundromat across the street.  i actually had the gall to say, as i was wheeling the cart out the door, ""if i'm lucky, a car will hit me.""  i was dead serious.  <br><br>

monika (you all know, she's my therapist) and i were talking the other day about how ""deprived"" (?) i have been since developing the eating disorder (the depression was written in my dna).  not so much in terms of just food, but experiences, emotional reciprocation, understanding, encouragement, love, ....must i go on?<br><br>

and it's true.  i have been deprived.  i am 30 years old and i seriously feel like the invisible woman.  nobody really notices when i'm around, and nobody makes any effort to be in my company, except, of course, for assholes who just want to fuck me.  my fingers want to type: ""i just want to hide,"" but i know i can't.  when i was in high school, i used to imagine myself just disintegrating (no pun intended- cure reference) into the air.  all the poetry in my journals from those years have that same common theme in them.  <br><br>

why me?  i know i shouldn't say this.  ugh...i just want to cry now and be a little kid who whines, ""it's not fair,...so-and-so has someone in their life who loves them and wants to spend the rest of his life with her...so-and-so has a colorful life when i feel as though i am living in a world of various shades of grey.""  whine, whine, whine.  <br><br>

i am scared.  of life, basically.  i am scared of the passing of time.  i am scared of my parents getting comfortable in their role as grandparents.  i am scared of the fact that my cousin, all of four months my senior, has a baby.  i am scared that my brother is a father.  i am scared that i don't yet know who i am, if anything.  when i pan through the experiences of my life, the only ""happy"" moments i see are really just mirages, or, moments that i misinterpret as happy when all they mean to someone else is nothing.  <br><br>

when i was younger, and experiencing pain and/or anxiety, whether it be from a visit to the dentist or anxiety from being repeatedly left at my aunt's house for two weeks at a time in the midst of this childhood phase, i was always told to close my eyes and think of someplace nice.  is it odd that i feel the necessity to do this on a daily, if not, weekly, basis?  <br><br>

fyi- i may be going into an ed program in cambridge, ma very soon (i.e., within the next few weeks).  we have wireless internet access there.  i have decided to document my days (however many that may be- debatable) there.  not only for you, my friends, but for myself.  the more i explore my experiences, especially through writing, the more in touch with them i am able to feel at a time when i feel like i have lost touch with everything.  <br><br>

i love you all,<br>

Hi Kristina.
I must admit that I am not looking for a serious relationship
However I must also admit that was very attracted by your unusual
look ...understated but very attractive, broodingly so and sadly pensvely
sensual.......I found that very appealing...I would lve to get know you
However if you choose not to respond..I will certainly understand
And I wish you well........


Noto bene..Your reply seems very skeptical ..

Hello I think youre beautiful, I spend time this time of year at barnes and noble, often, how about you?


umm...okay?  :-/

firstly, i will be attending an eating disorder residential program very soon (either before or right after christmas).  another thing i am involved with is applying to a grad school program, although i won't actually begin classes until summer semester (june, 2007).  besides that, i've kind of been on a more-turbulent-than-normal emotional rollercoaster.  <br><br>

the stress is so bad, it's causing me to have a slight case of tmj--only on the right side of my jaw.  i think this is what it is, anyway.  does anyone have this/ever dealt with this?  if so, let me know.  i have some questions.<br><br>

"event","<br>why am i so nice?  i had agreed to be a guinea pig once again (first time was for a foot reflexology massage, which was actually enjoyable) and agree to let one of the nail techs put acrylic french tips on my nails.  i specified that they must be short (i can't stand nails that go beyond the tip of the finger; yeah, i cut them to nubs).  she did the first four fingers and filed them down.  when she got to the thumb, she couldn't find a tip that would fit, so she rummaged through a box of another brand of tips and put it on my thumb.  we both immediately notice a HUGE difference between the four fingers and the thumb- the four fingers are annoying the living crap out of me- feels like i have crud under my nails (they're much thicker than the one she used on the thumb and, subsequently, all the nails on my other hand).  she wants me to keep them as is until the head nail tech sees them, and then she agreed to re-do those four fingers.  <br>

i HATE the feeling on my right hand (those four fingers).  the left hand feels like my own nails.  i wonder if i will be able to stand it another few days.  i just wish i didn't agree to this.  although my nails look pretty nice (i'm sporting an indestructable french manicure right now), i prefer plain and natural over this anyday.  i just don't like the thought of something artificial glued to any part of me.<br>

other than the nails...i decided yesterday that the reason i've been feeling zombie-like the past few days is the increase in zoloft.  so i went back down to my original dose.  my goal is to be on no meds at all- it just fucks your system up.  i want to be completely natural and non-drugged/manipulated, etc..  <br>

looks like it might rain and i have to go bring the sign and flag in (i'm writing this from the spa, in case you haven't already inferred that).  ugh...a friend of mine is not communicating with me and it's driving me insane.  i don't know if i said something wrong or that he took something in an ""unintended"" way, but i wish he would e-mail/call.  this is such a shitty feeling.  that's all."

i stayed at work today longer than i needed to.  i just fed on the numbness that mindless work produces.  yet, when i left around 2:30 and went to my parents' house to do a load of my own laundry, i crashed on their couch and was out like a light for a good hour and a half.  although they express their concern, i feel nothing from my parents.  they have come out and said, in family therapy, that they are afraid to talk to really talk to me, as they don't want to risk saying ""the wrong thing.""  this just makes me feel more alienated, and i truly think this is starting to effect me in a physical way, too (hence the sleeping in the middle of the afternoon).<br>

i am so scared right now.  i wish i had something to ""ground me,"" so to speak.  i really have to get back to meditation.  also, the guided imagery exercise monika did with me eons ago helped to clear my head.  i need a shoulder to cry on, arms to embrace this emptiness i feel inside and fill me with hope, some light. :-/"

-i HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE southern accents.  when i called verizon to report my lost phone, i got this southern belle asshole whose voice annoyed the living shit out of me.  all she kept saying was, ""i'm so sorry, i'm so sorry,"" like i had lost a family member.<br>

-my mom spotted these curtains in ikea and decided she'd make me a bedspread with them.  i don't like it.  plus, it's too damn short.<br>

-i HATE HATE HATE HATE not being able to find places when mapquesting them.  i mapquested cambridge college's lawrence campus and attempted to find it tonight with a dry-run.  no luck.  i ended up in the midst of the ghetto that is lawrence.  <br>

-i HATE that i drove an hour and a half to stupid wrentham and ended up with nothing (and i need clothes BADLY).  i figured my lack of purchases this time of year is due to my distaste of fall/winter.<br><br>

ugh.  apparently, there is now a german man (from the actual country, mind you) interested in me (or winked at me on match.com, a site i think i signed into eons ago and have been plauged by ever since).    hilarious.  guten tag.  yeah, i obviously don't speak that language either.<br>

i don't think i have ever felt as disconnected from the world as i have in the past few years.  i know that's a loaded sentence that may warrant some further explanation, but for those of you who know me, no explanation is needed.  here's one, though: my dad is 70 and my mom is 65; they are clearly entering into that joyous phase of life where senility kicks in.  of course, this doesn't help me much in the feeling-disconnected thing.  to make things worse, my therapists are on complely opposite sides of the spectrum in terms of what they think the next step in my recovery should be.  i feel like i am swimming in confusion, and have been since about highschool.  i'm done talking about that, though.<br>

i hate bleach.  bleach is thy enemy.  i didn't purposefully bleach anything at work today, but while organizing the laundry room, i spotted a pretty-much-empty container of bleach and decided to rinse it out and put it in the recycling bin.  a few hours later, i notice white spots on my top.  and fuck, a small spot on my new (purchased within the last three months) pants.  that put me in a fairly sour mood and prompted me to re-schedule my next appointment with my pcp so i could keep a day clear next week to make a trip to the wrentham outlets.  i know this is probably a dumb idea, seeing as though the outlets are over an hour away and the majority of the stores i shop at are within a much more reasonable distance, but fuck it.<br>

i just hope my car makes it there okay: only 100 more miles to go and my car's milage reaches 100,000.  jesus.  i remember getting that car.  the lovely car smell, and the bass turned all the way up while i played NIN's ""closer"" over and over and over.  driving all the way to taunton to meet a guy i had met online, dressed to kill with my black lace-up doc marten boots, short army-green skirt, and lacey black top.  he was ""my first kiss.""  awkward, but how cool it was that he was three years older than me and drove with one hand on the wheel and the other climbing up my skirt.  okay, i'm getting a little carried away here.  the point is: that car has brought me through many years (7...yikes!) and many life experiences.

i wonder if it's migration season or whatever.  when i got home, my mom called me to inform me what that ""sign"" meant:  it signifies a change, beauty, or love.  all good things.  when i was in highschool, i had a brief fetish for butterflies (i actually purchased a t-shirt at a conservatory in naples, florida with a larger-than-life monarch on the front (i think i wore that out in highschool, paired with one of my signature button-down cardigan sweaters; and if it wasn't that, it was either a smashing pumpkins t-shirt or a pixies one).<br>

good news on the baby front (my cousin's baby): he's going to be okay.  of course, when my mom told me this, i just happened to question her a little more (i.e., ""are they sure he's out of the woods,"" etc..), and she asked me if that was good news to me.  argh...  i am the devil.  yes, there has been a huge rivalry between rebecca and myself, most of it existing in my own fucked-up mind, but that's done with.<br>

some guy from this free online dating site (one of many that i've signed up for over the years) is really showing a lot of interest in me.  i'm kind of weary though.  i don't know.  his pictures look like he's a model; he's french (name is gustave); he's successful (works in cambridge in medicine--works for a drug company)...  i guess because i've gone through this more times than i care to count, i have decided to take a different stance (i.e., not jump into the swimming pool before dipping my toes in to test the water).  he e-mailed me today to ask when he could call me.  he said i am ""fascinating.""  i asked him why (lol).  his response was that i seem to embody a lot of what he finds attractive in the opposite sex.  hrmm...  okay.  i made up an excuse for tonight and said he could probably reach me tomorrow, but that i'd let him know.  whatever.  life is bizarre.<br><br>

<b>edited to add</b>: okay, i'm taking down one of the ads i have on one free site in particular.  i've gotten nothing but comments about how ""good"" my pics are from sketchy, creepy guys who are only interested in one thing.  fuck (exactly).  i'm so sick of this game!  i want a dog.  then, all my problems will be solved.  goodnight.  :-/"

"event","<br>this will be a quick update-type post, as i am in bed and getting sleepy.  just thought to add that disclaimer beforehand.<br><br>

yesterday was a visit with the past: some of you may recall the story of me last summer when i passed out as this shit-for-brains nurse tried to draw my blood.  well, since then, i've had this same ""nurse"" (she's not even a nurse- i guess they take anyone off the street and train them to draw blood, which is fucking scary, if you ask me) maybe once, and there were no incidents.  yesterday, i had her again.<br><br>

of course, a few doubts crossed my mind, but i didn't really acknowledge them.  i had an order from a doctor i had seen a few weeks ago (she wanted them to check my vitamin d count), and little did i know, when i handed the order over to nurse satan that that particular test required the collection of about five vials of the red stuff.<br><br>

so she sticks me.  no big deal.  and then she moves the needle a little from side to side; it's fucking killing me, and i think i mumble, ""it's pinching over and over,"" or something.  a real nurse sees her fucking it up and offers to do it for her (nurse satan said she had missed the vein and had punctured the sides of it.  oh lovely.  the real nurse decides to use my other arm (i always have it done on the right arm for some reason).  so she sticks me (and gets the vein(!) yahoo).  she's standing to the left of me, and nurse satan is standing on my right.  i don't think it was a smart move to pass the vials over to one another in plain view while hearing comments about my veins (""oooh, here's a good one,"" ""i got hit the side of the vein,"" etc..).  when they had finally completed the task, i felt the woosiness coming on.  the last thing i remember is whimpering, ""are you done?  put the bandaid on...put the bandaid on..."" and then opening my eyes and finding myself sprawled out on the floor with five or six medical staff hovering over me.  i had passed out in the EXACT SAME SPOT as before.  dejavu (did i spell that right?).<br><br>

so yeah, not a good day.  and now i have paint in my hair from having finished the kitchen cabinets this evening.  umm...i had painter's crack- i actually managed to get paint on my lower back/upper ass area and had to ask my mom to get it off.  not the highlight of my day, but oh well.  i don't embarrass easily.<br><br>

tomorrow, i tackle the computer.  maybe the ipod device (onstage), and perhaps a fish.  homemaking is my life."

"event","<br>well, i guess i'll update while i'm here.  i had posted something last night, but decided, for some reason or another, to delete it.  the impetus behind the post was the news i had been startled with from my my mom while at work yesterday afternoon.  my cousin, rebecca (a.k.a. the pregnant, ""perfect"" one that i have referred to oftentimes in lj), went into the hospital for an emergency c-section (her baby boy was due in late november) because her placenta erupted.<br><br>

she named the baby joshua.  last i heard, she was being transported to the hospital where joshua is receiving special care in the nicu- they had to airlift him to another hospital as i guess the hospital she was sent to didn't have the equipment/treatment facilities suitable to treat him.  my mom called me again this afternoon to tell me that joshua is sucking on a pacifier and rebecca they are feeding him rebecca's milk through a feeding tube.  he weighs 3 pounds.<br><br>

i was an ass yesterday when she first called.  the first thing that came out of my mouth was, ""they named him <i>joshua?</i>  i don't like that name.""  julie poked me in the side and said, ""you tell 'em, kristina.""  dork am i.  i think i am still shell-shocked about the fact that my cousin, who was my absolute best friend in the whole world up until high school, when i became this cynical, against-the-mainstream outsider of sorts, could be married and pregnant- this seemed all too real to me yesterday and today.  holy fuck- what is with this time (going by way too fast) thing?!  what about my life (or lack therof)?!  holy fuck- i'm 30.  [enter ticking clock sound and the cliche notion of one's biological clock spitting out a spring or two]<br><br>

i'm not saying i'm now having all these maternal thoughts and urges- quite the contrary- i don't think i've ever had those kinds of feelings.  yet, i can't help but wonder- if there is no baby in my future, is there at least a husband, the kind of ""life"" i grew up being made to believe i would have: the big [white- yeah, right] wedding, the big honeymoon, the buying-of-the-first-house, etc., etc., etc.,  these events have occurred in a very timely manner in rebecca's life.  what about mine?  what will happen in my life, if not the usual steps in the life of a woman?  maybe i'm going through this turmoil that is my life for a reason- to be able to turn around one day and use my experience to help others.  i had always imagined big things for my life, growing up- not the typical life-steps mentioned above, but the contribution of something to art, to life: some sort of significant kind of sign that declares loudly, ""i was here.""<nr><br>

the more i live my life, the more i believe that my problems (i.e., conditions or whatever) are the result of a fucked-up world and a fucked-up upbringing with those same life expectations put on the backs of each generation of my family.  when are we going to stop being so pre-occupied with ""what the right/expected thing to do is"" and open our eyes to the present- to ourselves, and how and what we really feel about things?  more importantly, when i am going to let go of these pipe dreams that aren't even my own?  when will i become comfortable with who i am and what my life is about?  okay, time to get off my soap box."

"event","<br>i figured it was about time to update this thing; i hate that i've been slacking on the updating thing.  i have all these things i could be doing right now to get myself to that point where everything is in its place and my computer is back to it's normal appearance (17"" monitor and full-size keyboard, etc..), but i'm tired, so i think i'll slack some more.  tomorrow i will kick ass.<br>

today was gorgeous, weather-wise.  i spent the morning at the spa doing laundry and trying to calm down the manager/aesthetician about her lunch date (she's a complete spazz, just turned 40, and actually talks to herself when nobody is in proximity to her- she's so gregarious- you know, one of those people who are afraid of being by themselves).  i never actually saw the ""hottie,"" but i'm sure i will hear all about it tomorrow.  *sigh*<br>

went into cambridge yesterday to check out the cambridge eating disorder center.  i was going to do their outpatient program, but it turns out to be a carbon copy of the program i was in a few years back.  i fucking HATE the fact that there is no quality treatment out there for people with eating disorders.  i won't even talk about what happened, as i've already explained it a dozen times to monika, my parents, etc.., it's a slippery slope, this eating disorder treatment business.  seriously.  once you are sucked into the treatment/recovery vortex, you are there for a while.  therapy: i think i can honestly say i haven't met a therapist yet who has truly impressed me- though kristina, the family therapist, comes close.  enough of that.<br>

being in that area (cambridge) brought back a lot of memories, some good, some bad, but overall,  uncomfortable.  i spent about five years of my life in that area post-college.  it's where i had my first serious boyfriend (first you-know), attended mass art, traveled into downtown boston on a daily basis as a peon for my boss, a doctor at brigham & woman's hospital, watched the whole 911 disaster live on tv one day when i was running late to work...there was a lot of growing/changing/loving/experimenting, etc.. during those years.  they were my 20's.  i'm 30 now.  fuck.<br>

*okay, mind stop spinning, feet take kristina to library to find something to watch.  fight urge to nap.*"

"event","<br>i've been ""nudged"" by <lj user=verbminx>.  i am officially a slacker.  my only excuse?  painting, hammering, painting, hammering, painting, and....hammering.<br><br>

oh- there was also the command by my pcp that i go into a treatment program asap for the ed.  in order to avoid re-telling the whole sordid story for the millionth time, i am going to just say that in the past two weeks, i was able to bring the weight back up a bit (on my own, mind you- not with the assistance of my shit-for-brains nutritionist), and now my pcp is walking on air and evidently has lessened her grip on the whole treatment program thing.<br><br>

as i told my pcp the other day, ""there must be some key equation out there that equals my recovery (i was talking about the depression stuff, too- mostly, actually), and i just haven't found it yet.""  i don't know; when you're entrenched in something for so long and you are at an age where you are faced with the blunt audacity of the reality of this world, you tend to have doubts about your sudden ""awakening,"" key equation solved and all.<br><br>

anyway....moving on.  i want to get back in the swing of updating on a daily basis, and i promise i will, once my computer (i.e., full-size keyboard and 17"" studio display monitor) are hooked up in the room i just finished painting.  this should be real soon (*crosses fingers*).<br><br>

today, i took a trip to ikea with my parents (the only reason i drag them along is for the car space (my dinky nissan sentra has nothing on their audi a6) and the extra hands.  i ended up purchasing a bookcase (the ""expedit,"" namely), and a little side table for my printer.  it was mobbed this afternoon.<br><br>

tomorrow is work (8:30-12:30)- oh yeah, i took more hours at work- as a spa attendant (i.e., laundry queen).  i'll be working (some) wednesdays, thursdays, and fridays, as well as my usual saturday and sunday.  sunday is the only day i'll be at the front desk.  evidently, i made some silly, stupid little mistakes here and there on a busy saturday (a typical saturday at the spa sees upwards of 45 clients), and, in an attempt to hold a tiny bit of superficial power over me, the nail tech and/or the aesthetician mentioned it to julie, the owner.  oh well.  i like folding sheets and towels more anyway, so poo on them.<br><br>

okay, i am officially entering geekdom with this post, so i will cut here.  talk to you soon."

The artistic director called me a weird artist today.  Twice.  The first time was appreciated, as he used it to describe who I am to another person.  The second time, he said it as he kinda dismissed this picture I shooped while he took his turn shooting the model."

I've been given yet ANOTHER job at work.  I'm to head up a Fashion Photography Academy in the Tenley Town salon where I'm now working.  This past monday I met with my old boss so he could teach me a very basic one-light setup for shooting said photography, and this picture is the result.  Thankfully I'm not teaching how to shoot the stuff, I'm teaching how to do hair for it.  I get to shoot it myself and I'm hella excited."

"event","I left the house yesterday at 6pm ready to go to London.  I was completely packed and good to go.  I had activated International Roaming on my phone and told the bank that my creditcards would be in London this weekend.  I took half a xanax on the way to the airport and was doing ok.  At check-in I told them to mark my name as a nervous flier, and proceeded through the security checkpoint(which was crazy fast!).  I found the rest of my group and tried to relax, but it wasn't happening.  

    I bought some water and watched the smokers in the glass cage they call a smoking lounge.  It was much like looking at the Sloth exhibit at the zoo but instead of trees and foliage, there were chairs and ashtrays.  I took the other half a xanax and waited to board the plane.  When we got on the plane, it was HUGE.  Well, in comparison to what I've riden in before.  It was a 777-200.  personal screens and a row of 5 seats in the middle.  I got to me seat, sat down and evaluated the situation.  I was panicing.  HARD. 
 
    I tried to tell myself that I was being retarded and I should just get situated but nothing worked.  Susan tried to talk my down and she couldn't.  I ended up getting off the plane at the last minute possible.  I even started crying on my way back to the gate's waiting area. I feel like a total failure, but I also just feel like I wasn't ready to go international yet."

So.........

I got me a new camera for my birfday!  I then received a cute skeleton figurine thingy.  THEN I received a cool portrait lens.  You see the results above.  I'm excited to see what I can do with a digital SLR, and I'll be sure to share on here."

<i>.....dude.....</i>


I just got back from an old friend's wedding.  It was actually a really nice one, but my friend Jon and I couldn't help but be bad.  First I'll say that Jon and I were the only 2 from our original group of 8 people to show up at Matt's wedding.  The ceremony was nice and short, and went immediately into cocktail hour!  7&7 for me and a Corona with lime for my friend please!  Since Jon was driving, I was drinking(as you can probably tell from the picture), and I was damn good at it.  1 7&7, 3 Corona's w/lime, 1 Vodka Punch, 1 shot of Johnny Walker, and 1 vodka & cranberry.  We got to sit at lucky table #13 and it had a cute little plastic sign that had a number 13 on it, along with a cute little white wedding disposable camera.  So Jon and I proceeded to make nice with our table mates by making everyone hold the sign at chest level while making mean/gangsta faces for the camera.  Everyone got a turn!  Turned out that our table mates were martial arts buddies of Matt's, and they told us that he just got his black belt.  Jon wowed them with his tech prowess while I giggled at how impressed they were.  Then Matt's younger brother came up to Jon and said hello and ""holy crap it's been years I remember you blah blah blah...""  But every sentence was punctuated with a ""dude.""  I shit you not.  EVERY single sentence.  It even replaced a few commas.

The whole evening was pretty cool besides the ""dude"", and just about every picture taken of Jon or myself involved a silly face.  I even wrote ""Me Drunk, Gregg"" in the signing book/picture book thingy.  I made Jon ask permission for me to do it though."

"event","I have 2 days of work left before I go on a somewhat lame vacation.  Why is it only somewhat lame you ask?  Because even though I'm not going to the beach, I'm going to install ""hardwood floors"" aka really good quality laminate in my foyer and the powder room.  I'm literally counting the minutes until 4pm saturday.  I'd rather call in sick today and tomorrow and be done with it, but I can't.  I'm just in a foul place right now mentally, and I don't want to deal with humans.  I was supposed to get breakfast today and that fell through, but I'm kinda sore about it.  I've already made plans with myself to go to the art museums next week, and that seems to be the only thing I'm excited about.  Damn I'm pissy....."

"event","So the last mixtape was well recieved, so I'm going to make another one.  Well, I already tried to make a depressing one, but the program crashed when I tried to save it, so it's safe to say I upset my computer with it.  I want to know from you guys what I should do next.

I'd make a poll, but I'm too cheap to actually pay for this thing, so just leave a comment!

Should I :
              (A) Redo the last mix keeping it more like the first half?

              (B) Try to do the depressing mix again?

              (C) Make a dark electronic mix?

              (D) Make an IDM/D&B sort of mix?"

If I could figure out how to post pics on here, I'd show you what it looks like, and all the gay arty pics I took of the train station and the train that are bound to become my computer's desktop wallpaper.  As I am at the end of day one, today was filled with plenty of inspirational editorial hair.  I think I'm ready to go home and do quite a few photoshoots.  after classes, a group of us went to Canal St. to buy fake purses and cheap shoes.  Then Brian, Rachel and I got food at The Hog's Pit BBQ.... better than it sounds and I got to have a few PBR's too!  Looks like I now drink cheap beer only.

"event","Ugh. I woke up today and I have that feeling that you get right before you start getting sick...DANGIT!

So I am super excited!!! Thanks to BRANDON, I will be getting back into lacrosse so thats sweet. He e-mailed everyone to see if there were any leagues and the only one is through the Summit. Its crazy that lacrosse isn't that big...I mean com 'on...It is a SWEET ass sport. They use to have it at Soccer Zone but for men only. Now they don't even have it because they just can't find enough people that want to play.

So I will be doing some referring (sp?) for some lil lax players and I'm excited b/c I'll get to wear a hot ass striped shirt w/ a kilt and oooo A WHISTLE. How sexy. But I have to go into training for it too, but that's fine. I know all the rules. 

And thennnnn.... ******* yayyyyy  in DECEMBER...the first Sunday...I will get to play in a 12 week program!!! I am SO EXCITED I cannot wait to play again you have noooo idea. Omg...I hope that there will be some people who can actually play good b/c I want some competition. And if they have never played before...shoot I will not go easy on them. I am going to kick some lady ass and make as many people as possible cry BRAR HAR HAR HARRR. I am so ready. I loooove faking people out I'm so good at that too. A bunch of you better come and watch me :) I'll put on a good show for you  *wink

I'm excited that I get to play lax here. I was crying as soon as I got back b/c I thought that I would never get to play again but nowww i can!

The Four Brothers movie was ok, Brandon and I saw it last night. The begginning was kinda so-so...but then of course when all the action and shit goes down it turned out to be a good movie. I dont think I would buy/rent it though to watch it again. But it had a lot of hockey in it and that makes me want to play hockey really bad. So since Brandon is big into hockey I can't wait till snow so that we can get a gang together and play around. That would just be sweet as fuck hands down :)

k adios!"

"event","So wow, I might be coming back to Holt. Life sucks sometimes. My reasons for leaving Notre Dame: They don't have my major so its hard finding classes that'll help me, it IS in Ohio...i mean gimmee a break, it is a lot of money to be going here basically just to play lax, if i go then I can go to LCC spring sememster and during the summer (its cheaper and they do have a Physical Therapy program,) I'll be able to save up money going to LCC and working full time during fall sem so that i can get a new car and also go to a transfering college like Grand Valley, U of M in Flint, or Central since they have good P.T. programs, i would be able to help coach the Holt girls Lax team (and this is my sisters first yr playing so i could coach her too :) , and also...i miss brandon. 
Reasons for Staying at NDC: My girls, my team, my sport. Lacrosse is my life, its my #1 love (i love u too brandon so shush) and who gets a chance to be the first...and i think only person from Holt to get a scholorship for lacrosse? Not many people can play lax in college, and its tough as hell to do it at a higher level; its a priviledge. I told my teamates today about me leaving. Kylie the Australian cried. That makes me so sad. Thats like a kick to the stomach. And everyone started finding out and were IMing me and coming up to my room to tell me to stay. That hard...but realistically...i can't waist money soley to play lax, and furthermore its not really helping me out career wise to stay here. ::sigh::  I will miss my girls. They're everything to me, I love them.    All I can think about is Kylie crying.

So, Tuesday night I will be back home. The next day I will get a job at Coach's b/c its right down the road from me so I dont have to worry so much about gas. Plus, they already said I got the job. So its working full-time, and then spring sem its balancing School, Work, Coaching, and Brandon :)  I know you'll be there for me punk, I'm just happy that I will see your face again. Ha, you and your cute smirky smirks.

"event","So I got up this morning to take my sister to tennis practice at 9...that sucks. So at the moment I'm not too tired so I'm going to do some researching. Don't you guys hate having a fat face? Ok my face isn't fat, but I smile so damn much that my cheeks are humungous (to me they are haha.) So mission: look up how to loose face fatness...So I went to askjeeves.com and typed in ""How do you lose face fat"" hahahhaah this is so humoring me like no other. Damn and there's nothing. Guess I will have to get liposuction of the cheeks when I become rich with my sweet ass Physical Therapy job YES!

So I have 2 more weeks left. That sucks but oh well I guess I'm ready to get this last year of NDC over with w/ a bang. Then I'll prob go to Davenport with my bud Erica so that we can get a house together. I love that girl :sigh: and she's away on a vacation right now...

My sister just got back from NY yesterday. We had to wait at that fucking airport from 10-4pm. I about puked everywhere. But the good thing is, is that my rich Aunt got me an IPod Mini and 2 Lui Vuiton purses...I will never use the purses so I gave them to my sissy :) Idk even though its like super cool for a girl if you have a Lui Vuiton purse, I hate them b/c when I carry it I feel like some rich snob bitch, whom are the people I really dispise. But the Ipod is WAY SWEET :)    :)    But yea we had to wait so long b/c my sissy missed her flight b/c of some gay flight attendent who didn't know what was going on...so If I saw him I would probably puke on him too. 

OK plan for today up untill the afternoon...take a nap, then eat...what I have NO FUCKING CLUE...I'll prob just eat some Mike n Ikes b/c we dont even have bread in this house to eat. Hmma then I will play el guitarra, and thennnn I will finally complete my painting of A Nightmare Before Christmas which is going to be SWEET ASS. 

And then I will hang out with my bestest bud in the whole wide world who smells like heaven and who's looks resemble Brad Pitts, and who farts like every 10 minutes, and he sings like an angel, and walks with the hottest manlyiest stride with such confidence that all women who see him turn their heads in complete infatuation as they whisper to their friends: ""DAMN I'd like to put some barbeque sauce on THAT FINE ASS and slobber that shit up with my hands tied behind my back!"" and then the other one nods in aggreement and replies back: ""Fo sho girlie, barbeque sauce doesnt' give that man justice cuz that boy is SAUCY!"" yea yea Brandon mmm. word.


Oh ha I forgot. So last night was one of the funnest nights ever. Vince, Brandon, and I got all dressed up and went out to dinner. Brandon wore his tux w/ the ruffled shirt which was pimp, and Vince borrowed some of Brandons accesories to make one sweet ass grandpa/hill billy outfit. He had on dress pants, a dress shirt and then this sweet bow tie with ""xoxox"" on it and suspenders. They were so hot. We went out to Bravo's and it was soooo good. As soon as we walked in people were staring at the guys, n we told the waitress that it was Vince's birthday so he got some free ice cream. Pimp.

Hey this Tuesday the guys and I...uhh so far Vince and Brandon and I...are going to go to Deja Vu so if anyone wants to come with us (i.e Nick, James, Steve,and the rest of the gang) that'd be awesome, the more the merrier. See I've never been there before so im so siked. This will be fun. So just call Brandon or I (927-9466) if you wanna go :)"

Seriously, I want to live in a Nudist colony for a week. Think about it...Swimming naked feels good, sleeping naked feels better, eating a popsicle naked is funny, eating naked with a bunch of people is funnier. You could be like, ""Ha, I'm playing tennis naked...""   ""Haha, I'm watching tv spread eagle and I'm naked...""  ""Hahahah I'm going to go to the bathroom naked, and I don't even have to even frickin pull my pants down.""

So you think its been hot the past couple of days, but don't worry there will be a cool front coming in this Tuesday afternoon, so the Lansing Journal Forecast says, that will bring the rest of the week to the 70's. Niiiccceeee.

Today I'm going to go Put-putting with a bunch of friends which will be SWEET because its for my bud Fannie from Germany who has returned for the summer. She came to Holt my Senior year and I took her to school everyday. She's great and I can't wait to hear what Germany-like things she has been up too, oo and her sweet ass accent. She's great.

So Common Grounds sucked major ass last night. Our choices were Country, or a band our moms might listen to. No good.

So next weekend Brandon, me and whoever else wants to come, are going to go CAMPING! I've never gone camping before, I'm so pumped! I'm excited about the whole not showering, getting drunk, swimming in a lake, cooking out, campfires, sleeping in tents thing. I've only slept in a tent once when I was 9 and it was in my friends backyard in ghetto Lansing. Pretty sad.

By the way, Taco Bell...so good when your drunk mmmm

So I was thinking of inventions and what not. And while I was doing this mind scheming, I was happily eating a hamburger with bread as the bun. Then it struck me...Why don't they build a restaurant...a GHETTO RESTAURANT? The menu would be simple...it would be all of your favorite conconctions that many make up when you have no food. Bread instead of buns, Potatoe chips and a side of ketchup, ham and cheese taco, macaroni mixed w/ ground beef and corn ...and all that crazy stuff. I mean...theres so many ghetto recipes that you can come up with. And it all may sound gross...but man oh man wait till you eat it...MMMMMM.  yup."

Not I!) did the ""Cowabunga"" and ""Peace"" sign to everyone, yea....thats about it. One thing...the ONLY thing that I wanted to do while I was over there...but didn't...SURF.

So last night was my first time ever toilet papering a house and it was AWESOME. Thanks to James and Brandon it was a success. I think we should do it every night. 

But my friend April from Pennsylvania and I were talking today and she's like, ""Toilet papering is SO much fun but you know what else you have to try out? Doughnuting."" 
I've never heard of Dougnut-ing so she told me that the big thing to do in PA is to go to Dunkin Donuts at midnight and get a dozen doughnuts, b/c they're all old by then and go for $2, and you have to make sure that you get a lot of jelly filled ones. Next, you drive around at night, and any moving object you wind up and attack w/ your deliciously jelly filled doughnut. She says, ""Oh my God, and its the best b/c the outside is all hard by then but you have this gooie middle so as soon as it hits the car all the shit sprays EVERYWHERE!"" 

So thats what I'm going to do, and Brandon you have to do it with me :)

My problems: My right knee and hip, and I have shin splints that w/ each step I can feel the muscle tearing off my bones. GREAT. Someone take me to a doctor and give me a knee brace and I'll just toughen out the rest of my problems. If I cannot run this summer, I think I will die. If I can't run, that means no lacrosse. If I cannot play my game, the only sport that keeps me living, the only thing in my life that I absolutely love and could not live without then I might as well save my money up now, buy a gun, and shoot myself in the head. 



But anyways, tonight Brando n I are gonna go to some Comedy show that he gets tickets for, for free. So thats pretty sweet hopefully that'll make me feel a tad happier.

Hah the first guy didn't do shit, just stood there n like stared at us. Then we ran outta poop so we used all this crap from Brandon's refrigerator such as: ketchup, mustard, jelly, peaches, cream cheese, jello, pizza, and various other objects. It uhh, smelt like shit and I almost threw up. Ha, we got it all on tape the whole thing is a masterpiece. So...the second guy actually got outta the house, and went to go get a tea kettle to put the flames out. He looked around for like 5 min, examined the bag for a min, and then just sat behind his door lol I was laughing so hard. So we're figuring out when to make a move n run just as the garage started to open so Brandon's like SHIT RUN! Good times good times. I'm up for more mischief any night Brandon lol.

Oh note to readers: Do NOT go see the movie w/ Ashton Kutcher in it...I think its called Love Rushes In? Poo on that I almost spontaniously combusted in my seat. The whole setup was horrible and very predictable. NO...

I love my team though, and it sucks Mulls isn't coming back :( I really should be studying for my finals right now. I have mixed feelings on going back home. Maybe I should of stayed here in Ohio? Nah. I miss my Holt people way too damn much. Especially my lax girls.

So year in review: Met the roomie and we hit it off GREAT. First night...drunk n spraying air refreshener under everyones door. First people we meet: Phil, Lorenzo, and Baseball Frank. God I love you guys. Meet the Lax team...Oh hi....theres...6 of us SWWWEEETTTTTT. But we had great practices and an awesome Tourney. I was sooo nervous but I loved it. Wow I heart Lacrosse. Ahh and hanging w/ the internationals....FUN TIMES lol. Then we discover that our room is HAUNTED. That was very interesting so Rach and I basically lived w/ Kovach and Flowers for a month. Thank you guys. HA and then the clubbing days! Good times grinding on diff guys, ohh the mexican guys I first ever danced w/...""Dont touch my Dixie Cups!"" lol. Then....ehh emm DRAMA. Won't get into that. Going to NY two times, once to see Canada, second to see the awesome Bandits Pro Mens Lax Game WHOOP WHOOP! Both times in NY...drunk off my asssssssssss. Met some cool people though. Meeting Miss Kylie Flett was a pleasure. I love you Kylie. Umm especially when you carried me down the hall as I was passing out and raging about the ""hoe bag and james"" telling everyone to fuck off and suck a nut and I'd kill their mothers. Thanks for being there for me :) Lacrosse season was KICK ASS. School was STRESSFUL. Got my job at AE, met some cool people. Drunkin nights w/ the lax girls...HA, oh Tab is the best person to be w/ when drunk *wink. Stealing the B-Ball guys huge ass basketball was GREAT. Meeting James was GREAT. Umm minus the Drama and the hoe bag but ya know its all coo. I think James is the most interesting, highly achieved, hottest, best personality, funniest boyfriend I've ever had. I love you. Ummmm so now I'm just packin up the room, studying for finals, ending all the memories. Good times, thank you guys.

Yea Brandon I had fun w/ you over the weekend. Things I will never forget: Me learning how to skateboard, you jammin on the guitar (you're fuckin sweet,) going to the haunted chapel and actually finding that there is something there, chillin at the mexican restaurant w/ you n my parents, and haha at the end of the night you sayin ""Duddddee I am sooo drunk! I must of had like 14 beers.""  ....and an hr later ""Dudddeeee I HAD to have had like 14 or more beers! I think I had more!"" .....and then the next morning ""Dudddeee I am STILL DRUNK! What did i do last night?"" HAHAH. I love you Brandon. Ha, and then you getting lost, and then coming back to college to sleep till 5 pm. Good times good times. 

The end of the year sucks, only because of non-stop projects and finals coming. Other than that, yea I will miss this place. It seems like I've been here forever. I love the people here, I think I might actually cry when I leave which is funny b/c when I came here I cried b/c I wanted to go home. Good times here at lil ol' NDC. 

I really want to go lasar tagging. Ooo I've never gone paint-balling. That'd be fun. 

Wouldn't it suck if everyone had a thinking bubble and everyone could see everything that you were thinking? Man that'd suck. Because you think of things that are so weird, and most of the time sexual. ha wow. 

Tomorrow is going to be fun ;) Can't wait..."

Good times, I remember Kristin Spencer's mom would always come up to me and be like ""Whitney we just love watching you run girl."" Hahah I really miss family.

"event","So we had our second game. First one was complete shit. We played scared. They are complete and total bitches and all I wanted to do, the only thing that I would love to do right then, was kick their asses and shove all their rude comments right back up in their dirtstar. Hahah that's Kylie's word. Gotta love australians. 

But then today's game, UGH MAKES ME SO MAD! They're a first year team (Seton Hill) and were not that good. We SHOULD of won. 7-13 was the score. I scored 2 of those goals, and was the first one to score. I did really good and everyone keeps on congradulating me on it which makes me feel great. I played real aggressive and it was awesome. Then the coach came over to me and commented on how fast I am, she said she was amazed and wanted to recruit me. I was like thank you, but I'm stickin here. 

But our field was a big mudslide so it was real hard to control things. Everytime you went to fake out, turn fast, stop abbruptly, or pick up a ground ball, someone was either sliding into you or you were sliding head first into the grass yourself. It was fun. It was just one of those games where we played soft the first part, and then picked things up real fast at the end and did SOO good. But if only we played that way the whole game ya know. I know we can do it, it's so obvious. 

But next Wednesday we have another home game (Wittenburg) and we beat them in the tourney so we have a great chance of winning THIS TIME. 

I'm so sore right now it's unbelievable. Bruises and what not, makes me feel tough ha. But ok, so I have new kleets and they gave me this horrible blister. Well it's infected now I think b/c its puffyness is spreading up into my ankle and everything. The thing's this huge gaping open wound now that's soooo red it makes me want to puke yuk. 

Know what one of the worst feelings in the world is? Putting anticeptic (I think that's what it's called) into an open wound. I think I almost passed out, you have no idea.

My grandma's chihuahua died. His name was Palomo and everything. Such a cool dog. That sucks.

I'm so swamped with HW that it's all I'm going to be doing over my break AGAIN. But I'm coming home on Thursday and am so happy. Easter will be fun we always go to this breakfast/brunch thing at the Holiday Inn...haha good song. 

We're going to watch the Grudge soon. I can't wait b/c for the most part I heard it was good, but I never get scared at movies. But my friend Landon is getting us McDonald's and I CAN'T WAIT! I haven't had fast food in soooo long. Not since Christmas break. 

I witnessed a car crash today. It was really scary and I was pretty shaken up about it. I was pumping gas, and was watching into the intersection and it just happened. The lady in one of the cars wasn't moving at all and they couldn't get to her b/c the car door was locked. Damn automatic locks. But it was scary. Be careful people b/c a car crash just happens in a blink of an eye. You're just sitting there and then it hits you and it's like a dream. 

I want to see the movie The Jacket again. It's so good. 

You know what. I really like grape Gatorade. I've only had the lemon kind, and now I've discovered that there are more equally orgasmic Gatorade flavors out there :)"

So his best bet was to let the cockroach crawl the rest of the way and out the other ear. Well he would always hear the thing moving and scraping inside his head and when i finally came out he was so relieved because it was driving him nuts. Well come to find out later that the damn thing laid eggs in his head so he had to then wait for all of them to hatch, and then all crawl out all over again. How scary is that?! Makes me itch even more thinking about it ugh. 

Who ever made up that song John Jacob Jinklehimer Schimdt? What is the purpose of that song, it's so stupid. Is there a story behind it? Did someone just get bored and decide to praise a name? I mean Ring Around the Rosie, Lundon Bridge is Falling Down, they have meaning to them. I just don't understand. I should come up with a childhood rhyme. That'd be awesome and all but I haven't the time nor creativity to think of one right now. 

So I have to go to class right now: Newswriting. So uhh I'll finish this later.

Ok I'm back. Wasn't too bad. I did this article on Bonnaroo which is this music and arts festival. Tickets are expensive now b/c it's been going on for a while and the cheapest ones have already sold out. But its this amazing concert that you all should go to at least once in your life. I was but I can't b/c i have to work and yea but its 3 days of awesome concerts omg the line up is amazing. You basically live like a hippie for 3 days...dont shower, drunk and high the whole time. There's things like yoga, music technology center, man the list goes on. To check out more info go to http://www.bonnaroo.com. DO IT!

Ok i have to go eat now so i'll finish. Ok I'm back. Mmm it was pretty good. Phili Chicken Sandwich...Anyways. On April the first my dad and Uncle Ron are going to come to my lax game! I'm so excited/nervous. Ugh my game on this Wedn. is coming up so fast, i'm so scared. I really hope I'll do sooo good. I've been really aggressive during practice and coach took me aside and said I was doing really good so that makes me happy. 

It's so nice out today, minus the rain, but it's making me so happy. Hope everyone is having a great day in Michigan! Ttyl guys"

But I have to keep my cool, b/c I know that I have a game this Wed. and its slowly freaking me out. Later we went to this tatoo parlor. We're all going to get tatoo's at the end of the yr. We can't do it now b/c it's bad for you to sweat in a tatoo or something. But I'm still thinking about it. I'm not sure if I want one. I mean I've always played around w/ the idea but I want to make sure that whatever I get is something I REALLY want and just not something I get in the moment ya know. I mean its my body, for life. 

Then of course for dinner we went out to... TEXAS ROADHOUSE!!! It's so weird to go to one in Ohio. It was so good though. But the one in MI is sooo better. Service is better, waiter's are friendlier, and my salad was so small, that made me very disappointed. So...good job for anyone who works at TRH in MI, you're def better than Ohio! I kept on looking around for Shawn too. Its funny b/c whenever I go there, it's because of course I love the restaurant, but I love saying hi to Shawn lol. So I kept on looking for ya bud. 

But then we went and saw the movie ""The Jacket."" The main guy is sooo cute! But it was a really good movie. It was so sad, it actually made my chest hurt, it was so sad. I liked it. 

But now I'm back, its 2:13 and everyone else is drunk. Kinda sucks b/c they're so loud. Oh well. I'm so tired too, its hard to sleep here and I don't know why. I have tons of hw tomorrow that I'm already stressin over, and practice. Other than that...nada. 

I cannot wait to go to California. I want to learn how to surf so bad. Oooooo I get to go home for Easter break that makes me so happy! But I just want to be a beach bum and soak up the rays. Just chill back and stare at the waves. That's the best. Especially people watching. On the beach is the best. I mean there's lovers, old people, people walking on the beach by themselves. You wonder what they're thinking about, if they're happy, what they'll do after this. And I love watching little kids play. It's so funny, it makes you smile. 

I want to better myself. I need to stop stressing so much, and I need to stop eating shitty food. There. Baby steps :)

I hope I'll be something great when I grow up."

She's older, in her 20's and has done this all her life so she gets so frustrated w/ the new players, but doesn't realize how amazingly great they are for first year players. She needs to get over it b/c she's going to start bringing us down until we're shit and can't get ourselves back out of the hole. We'll be fine, I think we all just need a break from everything. Coach is getting horrible too. Today she bitched us out, saying that we're ""Fucking babies"" and what not. We need to step it up, I know I am. I need to get more aggressive, and so far it's been successful. I've been proud of myself so far this week.

Damnet, I think I'm going to get sick. I just now recovered enough to be able to play lacrosse, and now I'm afriad that this cold is going to be really severe. It's been going around the school, and if one person gets it, more than half the school will. This is the negative part about going to a small school. Ugh my neck in the front hurts so bad and I think it's swelling, but it's not a soar throaght, and I feel more and more weak by the hour...oh boy I'm really scared. I should run and work out and do things while I still can.

On another note, my grandmother (mexican side) called today and it made me so happy! I miss her so much. She's sending me $75 which is too nice, I'll accept it but as always I feel bad about excepting so much money from people. 

I'm going to start working at American Eagle, so this is cool. I get 50% off of my clothes so I'm so happy! They have really cute new spring clothes sooo...YES! 

I went to Mongolian Barbaque with some friends last night. It was sooooo good! I've always wanted to go there so it was pretty cool. It's a fun environment, I would definitely go again. It was a little on the expensive side, so I'm kinda glad I didn't have to pay. And then we went back and had movie night and watched Ray. It was pretty good, 2 1/2 hrs long so it seemed kinda like forever. But it had great music. 

YEA! One more week left of school and I'm done! I am so excited and ready to go home! You have no idea how much I miss my mom and sister. Omg. I love the feeling...once I go past Okemos on the highway, and I see that Put Put place, I know that I'm almost home. And then I get off my exit, and pass things that I use to pass everyday, and then I get into my neighborhood and see Brandon Connely's car in his driveway, as well as Mike Perry's. And then I pull into my parking spot, and walk in, and smell my house. It's so warm and I'm instantly comforted. And then my dogs come racing in and I fall to the floor b/c they all jump on me. And then I hear my mom and sister's voice ""WHITNEY!"" and Kelsey says ""MY WHIT WHIT IS BACK!"" and I hear them running from the living room, and see them coming towards me, and I have to fight back the tears as they give me this huge hug. And then I smile, and walk further into my home, and then I feel like I could stay there and be happy forever. My home."

TOURNAMENT IN 2 DAYS! So nervous oh wow so nervous. It's in Denison which is about 2 hrs from here. I think 10 games, each 25 min. I want to do so good, but me hurting I'm afraid. We only have 12 people able to play. Thats how many are out on the field at a game. The min. people getting hurt per game is 3...so, we're prob screwed. Just have to play smart. Some guys from here are going to go watch us. I love that, that means so much and its so far away. Wow die hard fans lol.

When is SPRING going to come? I'll be so happy everyday. O wow. I love it. I need to sleep like woah.

I remember my 8th grade German teacher Mrs. Luzanski (who was so awesome) had this GREAT fear of spontaniously combusting. It was so hilarious. Out of no where she'd start talking about it. Ha, the janitor has his mouth wide open... he's so into this. He looks freaked out. Dude, you're not going to catch on fire b/c of some chemical reaction in your body. There's nothing in your body that could react like that. 

I'm getting abs. YES! Our light in the bathroom went out, and theres no window so its like this pitch black dungen. So I was like hmm, how the hell do we do this? So we all piss and take showers w/ the door wide open. Yes, even #2's even though its so weird and I HATE it. LOL. I discovered a flashlight though, so I use that now ha."

Last weekend: Bandits game was AWESOME. Hung w/ people in the hotel. 5 am there was a fire. 10 am we get in a car accident. Miss our play. Rach's car dies. It was fun though, the game made up for it. 

My car will be fixed tomorrow. Battery is shot. I have to take it in, they'll charge it for free. Cool.

Game this weekend, actually tournement of like 8 games. On Sunday. Feelings: Scared shitless, nervous, anxious, pumped.

School: Too much work. I'm stressed

Lacrosse: I love it, but I'm sad right now. I want us to get better.

I want to go home. 

I like it a lot here though.

Major questions in my life: What college will I go to next year? What career should I follow?

I'm always so anxious for this day to end and the next to begin, even though I know it'll be the same process all over again. Why? What am I looking forward to?

I should go. I should sleep. Yea I should definitely sleep. Wake up call: 5 am for practice. Homework time."

I just have to take over for my sweetmate April b/c apparantly she has come down w/ strep throat over night. Yeah...If I get it, I will just DIE. 

So again I am...does flabbergasted fit? No I think that means you're just speechless? Well ok I'm just POOPED. Practice has again kicked my ass. But tomorrow we dont get up at 5 b/c we have team pics so that's awesomely sweet. 

So I love my Australian sweetmate Kylie. She's f-in awesome. She uses so many profanities...and most of the time they're some crazy Ausie phrases which just makes it all the more hilarious. Oh wow I <3 Australia. 

This weekend is when we go to NY to see the professional guys lax game! So can't wait. After that...hotel room...club...stip clubs....hot tub...oh good fun.

Shawn I think you are so sweet for thinking about me for V-Day :) Even though it REALLY won't work out, the thought was awesome and made my day. It's cool to think someone would do that just for me ;)

I think that if you could make a movie out of your life, that's awesome. It's good to not have a dull life. I wonder if mine is? I don't think so...mmm no.

I'm real homesick right now though. You have no idea how much I can't wait for spring break to come. I want to go home. I miss my family. Ha we IM eachother now, my mom and sister and I. It's funny, b/c it seems like I'm talking to a friend or something. My mom talks so cool lol, she like knows all the abbreviations and slangs and shit. Go mom.

I will forever hate tuesdays and thursdays. We have to work w/ the softball team in the gym, and their coach is hardcore b/c she's this hot shot athletic trainer. Think positively: I will get into such good shape, it's amazing. Yes...I will look hot. ahahahahh

We have to do diff drills, 2 min in each which is a lot when you're doing it. Then we sprint around the gym, and then to the next station. Things like, mountain climbers, squats, push ups, medicine ball drills, sprints (suicides, etc) oh so much more. Damn, you know those drills that football teams have to do: jog in place and get down on the whistle, yea that hurts after awhile. 

Im pooped. Im done. But I will go on.

Ever get razor burn in your armpit? OUCH. It's KILLIN me. oohhhhowooooooo

My knees are all one big bruise, ha i've never seen anything look so funny. All purply..oh ok i'll stop, I know I'm making you all hot. 

In Theology we have to watch a movie today...my 2:10 class. Its called My life..I think. It has Nicole Kidnman in it.  It's so sad. This guy has cancer and hes just really bitter about it. He's so mad, and his wife just wants him to make the most out of it, and shes pregnant too. So he's going around video taping himself so that his kid can know who he is. And in the process he learns about himself. Ugh so sad. I think I'd be so mad too though. How can you be happy when you know you're going to die in 3 months, and you have to leave everything. Your wife, you cant see your kid, you're kid might grow up w/ another dad. Wow too much. So many things we take for granite. 

""This is how we do, we make them movin like a fool up in the club"" good song ohh good so good. Makes me wanna dance. I just might. Righttt    now.   K i did it and it was awesome AHAH im so bored. 

I want to be a hippie. Wouldnt that be so much fun back in the 60s/70s? Oh man, I could def be a hippie. DAMN MY ARMPIT. 

You know what i really HATE. What really PISSES ME OFF? THOSE GOD DAMN RINGTONE THINGS ON TV!!!! They're like....press 331 for the hot rod, press 332 for hot Natalie, press 333 for the WHAT THE FUCK. SHUTUP. I DONT LIKE YOU. YOU STUPID PEOPLE I WILL BOMB YOU AFTER I...rip out your eye balls, and chop you up in little pieces slowly so that you can suffer, and look upon you with a smile as I gaze upon the work i have done. GOD. 

And then they have another one where its like a rap from this purple...what is it GOD DAMN HIPPO? And then theres this chicken....UGH. WHEN WILL IT STOP!!! HES ALREADY WATERING YOUR PLANTS, LET THE KID LIVE IN YOUR HOUSE. HES ALREADY LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE, LET THE POOR THING SLEEP IN YOUR BED! JESUS, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?"

But anyways, so today has been kind of slow. Just doing homework. I've been feeling really down lately and dont know why. But tonight we're going to go drunkin sledding, so it should be fun. 

I'm going to go to a New Found Glory concert w/ a bunch of runner guys and tessa from texas who's on my lax team. It should be sooo much fun. It's on April...4th or 9th I forget. I'm so ready. 

We have Monday off of school, but Tuesday practice starts at 6 am, so that'll suck so bad. Oh well. I'm very very ready for it all to begin. That means I'll be extra busy, so this year will start to go by fast. I can't wait for spring weather, it makes everyone so happy :)

Next weekend Rach, me and some other lax girls are going to a professional lax game. Well we're going to sleep that night in a hotel which is a mile away from downtown which is where all the clubs are. We're going to go to a strip club too FINALLY :) I've always wanted to go to one. But then we'll go back to the hotel which has a hot tub, indoor pool, and sana sawna (sp?)

But this sem I have harder classes...so we'll see what happens.

Love is confusing you know that? I think I could just possibly spend the rest of my life with you. I know I have to prove myself to you so that you know I'll never hurt you again. Don't worry I'll think of something. 

But we're young, and it's good that we're far away from eachother for now. It gives us time to be young. I really think we should just chill with people, and if that time ever comes for us to be serious...then bring it on.

But I think that you are such a wonderful person. You bring a smile on everyones face :) Don't ever change. Your great qualities will get you far in life.

Yes, tis the day, tomorrow is the day. The day I'll be going back to Ohio. Why?

It'll be ok. I mean I'll be back by the beg. of March. It's only 2 months. Plus lacrosse, oh lacrosse, im nervous but so ready. 

Not ready for my everyday routine in Ohio though. Classes at 8am till whenever. In between is naps and catch up time w/ rach, practice 2 times a day I think, dinner at 5, nap, partying till 4am, start over at 8. 

I have 2 classes w/ rach....oh TROUBLE. Great fun :) he he he       I want to try better this semester. I did really good last sem....I dont know what i have but i know at midterms I had all A's which is soooo awesome. But at the end, ya know you tend to slack. I want to try hard and not slack asss  much. 

Newswriting class will be fun. Art History= ok   Theology= suck ass  Math = easy (beg. Algebra....come on now i suck at math but not that bad) Amer. Lit= suppose to be challenging, but english is my thing.

I think it'd be fun to own my own business. Like a physical therapy place...mmm massages? I wanna be w/ people, and help them out in some way. I wish i could stand blood and what not, I'd be a nurse. I want to be a physical therapist, but I cant stand stinky old people. 

Like ok, say some guy comes in. He doesnt look like he showers, has greasy hair, and looks like a rapist. Say i have to help him w/ his foot. 
Umm no. You're gross get away from me...thats what i'd say. 
No i wouldnt im too nice, i'd have to put on a mask and rubber gloves though seriously.

Time to take a shower though... No ones home hahahharrrrr, singing in the shower is my next mission :)"

I think Kurt Cobain is hot, am I the only one? Hes so hot in like a dirty way I guess. 

Today's been so boring, so this journal is too :) I cant go anywhere b/c my car lock has been frozen shut for a couple of days now, and its really PISSING me off. That damn car is so old. 

So, good time with Shawn last night. Good movie, Garden State. I like movies when their set up is ""different."" Tried something new as well. Hmm it was fun, I'm glad I was w/ Shawn I felt comfortable. It was a little different than what I expected, but cool. Not a bad experience I guess.

""The day is done, but I'm having fun. I think Im dumb, or maybe just happy."" hmm good song

12:57...I wake up. Realize I've waisted half my day, and jump outta bed. Take piss, put hair up, brush teeth, walk downstairs to empty house...everyday routine.

WHAT THE MOTHER FUCKING SHIT? COCK! BALLS! YEAH.....SHIT!

My dog like fucking spewed shit all over the house....""There's shit...everywhere...its on the floor...its on the walls...its on the ceiling?"" 

Not really, but yes all over the floor. It's like he fucking pissed out his shit. It's like a fucking land mine out there. There is shit puddles and smear marks from his ass EVERYWHERE..cuz yeah, he's a very fluffy dog...so everytime he sits his fat ass down, there is yet another shit mark on the god damn floor.

What am I to do? Im gagging. It's all over him too, we're seriously going to have to think about shaving him.

So what do I do? I freak, I yell bloody murder at the dogs. The chihuahuas are shaking in the corner, and the fluffy one is staring at me like a dumb ass. 

So, I walk, and breathe....put some newspaper and napkins over every shit puddle, and go make some ramen noodles."

Yeah, I think I've felt that only once in my life. 

How many times have you guys felt like that? Not many I guess... and when it does happen, usually that relationship is so great that you wonder if you'll ever have another one like that. It just wouldnt be the same either. 

I hope I get that feeling when I meet my future husband, whoever out there in this world that'll be...Hmm isnt that crazy, my future husband might be doing something right at this very moment, and I dont even know him yet...or maybe i do? Woah trippy. 

I feel bad for those people who dont have a wife/husband. Wouldnt that be so sad and lonely? Everyone needs love


I really don't want to go back to ohio. really

And why did my dog have to shit on himself? Seriously, this day is f-ed up. I want summer to come....ahhh the warmness, and getting a tan : ) My house just might be below zero. I have to sleep w/ a frickin winter hat on. Umm yeah, so not cool."

"event","So, I just watched Nicolas Cage's 'Adaptation' and fell in love, which is a complete surprise because I usually hate Nicolas Cage. 
It's so realistic, so surreal, so fantastic. 
He was so..dull. And I absolutely loved it. 
It just goes to show that even successful people can fail and can be fat, balding, old and pathetic, even in Hollywood. The rest of the real world has a shot at fame! 
The script was beautifull and creatively written and flowed nicely, with choppy bits that created necessary drama and long, boring pauses. 
I love orchids. I love flowers in general, but orchids are my favourite. 
I really liked the idea behind the 'ghost Orchid' being able to find your exact soulmate. The one that you know belongs with you, only with you, and is the only one that gives you exactly what you need. It's very intriguing. 
Example; the bee and the Bee Orchid or Ophrys Apifera. The bee finds this flower, pollinates it and moves on to the next Bee Orchid, pollinating as many plants as possible. It's the bee's destiny to find it's partner, make love to it so as to create pollen to spread over the flower. It's quite fascinating, really. Even if it's more than one flower, it's still one in the same as it still looks just like the bee and to the bee, it's all the same. 
Charlie Kaufman wasn't living. He was just being. Scared of everything and everyone. He was brilliant but he was writing about things he himself would never get to experience, until he was forced to write about flowers. 
I think the world could do with alittle lesson about flowers. 
To take a minute to sit back and learn something from a living thing that helps our world breathe. 
Take a new perspective on life. 
Live every day to it's fullest.
Never be afraid. 
Never regret.
Love to your best know how. 
And never look back, only look forward. 
 
I'm quite ashamed that I hadn't seen this movie earlier, that I hadn't watched it when Meryl Streep was nominated for the award for it.. I guess I just never thought I'd get this much out of it. 

Recommendation: watch it. 
Warning: the first hour may be abit drowsy, but Charlie Kaufman ""WOW's"" the audience by the end, so stay tuned!"

"event","It's recently become apparent that old friends have become nothing but strangers and new friends have become something better. Most of us have changed, not all for the better, but changed none-the-less. Of course, this was bound to happen as the world spins we all follow it, I just never imagined some of us would become what we have. The actions of certain people have caused rifts and giant gaps that can't be fixed. These actions have consequences and those consequences will be big. Certain people go to great lengths to please others, in fact, they go so far as to disgrace the people around them. The outcome of your actions won't be pretty and you must be prepaired for this. Even if you think you've done nothing wrong, think back to the days when you were closest with the one person that stuck with you, the one person that believed in you, the one person that didn't judge and think about what you've done. Think about what you've given back. Have you given back? Have you done anything to help? No. You've simply made accusations. Assumed the worst and backstabbed. If you only knew the kind of damage you've caused.. but you never will, because you don't think about anyone else but yourself, you never have. You may say you do, you may try to prove that others are on top, but it's simply not the truth. The only reason you're happy right now, is because you've stomped over people to get there, tore down the people that were supposed to mean the most to you, people that care(d) for you. They've lost all respect for you, as sadly, have I. I never wanted it to come to this, but it seems it has and you haven't a clue as to why. 
If I ever get close to anyone ever again, I'll be sure to keep them atleast arm's length away so as not to let them in as much as I let you in."

"event","So, as of 12:30 PM today, I no longer have a bunny. She'd been really sick with that infection, but she was doing alot better yesterday and the vet said she'd be just fine after two weeks of the antibiotics. She wasn't herself this morning though, she was all quiet and hardly moved when I picked her up to give her her medication. We had an appointment to drain the fluid at 12:30 today, so I went down to get her ready to bring her over and she was on her side, I thought she was finally sleeping. But, her eyes were open and when I touched her, she barely moved and her breathing was extrememly shallow. I couldn't pick her up I was too upset, so my mum did and we rushed over to the vet, luckily it's only 5minutes away. They gave her oxygen and such but she didn't pull through. They said the infection had taken over and her heart wasn't strong enough. I just feel so awful.. I knew something wasn't right this morning, but I just figured it was the meds or something.. poor thing. Anyway, atleast she's at peace now."

"event","Alright, so I've got a few things to update on. Steff wanted me to finish up on our amazing day; that was last week. Oh well. 
So, it was our photoshoot/sugar mountain day AND our skip Philosophy/watch movies /hand out resumes in the rain day that held such great escapades. Many adventures were too occur, yet again. We discussed how great it would be if such things as penny bombs exsisted. Though, talking further about these, we decided that terrorists might actually kill us all if these were made. So, we talked abit more about these and came to the conclusion that penny BONGS were much safer and cooler. Anyway, moving onto the photoshoot. We walked down to Victoria Island to take some pictures. While slipping and sliding down the non-existant stairs we discovered a sign that said ""aboriginal experiences"" it was pretty great, so Steff took a picture of me standing by it, she thinks I look aborginial, apparently. So on our merry way we went, snapping photos of everything when low and behold we come across a hazardous waste door! So, naturally I took a picture. I tried to squeeze in to get a closer look, but the wall kind of got in my way. Anyway, we took all the pictures we wanted and after trying to break in, decided it time to walk back as our stomach's were pretty much eating themselves out of desperate hunger. So, on our way back to Rideau we see two snowboarders, who we had seen on the way to the Island, were still there! So, we tapped them on the shoulder polietly (which we should of done for button boy...) and asked them to take a picture. So, we do and carry on. So, we get to Rideau and decide we want McDonald's, they use crack in their food, it's the only reason we always crave it. So, we order our fries and drinks and head to a table. We're sitting there and all of the sudden I notice this kid is like staring at me.. like, blanting staring at me. So, I stare at him, thinking he'll look away or stop or something, but no, he continues. I got really creeped out, so we left. After the fries, we saw Sugar Mountain and ended up wanting candy.. so, in we trod, filling our bag with candy! We bring it to the counter and get the total; 17$ once again! So, after paying, we head to our bus and get on, eating our live cable wires and such (from England!) and giggling at the amount of money we've spent on tooth decaying goodness. As I'm sitting there, Steff decides she wants to me kill.. she shoves a PURPLE gummi bear at me! Those things kill..literally! I took it from her, quite violently, and throw it to the ground, stomping and squashing it completely! As I'm did this, the people on the bus gave me tons of weird looks..I think I frightened most of them. Oh well. Anyway, we part ways and that ends our photoshoot/sugar mountain day. 
So, our skip Philo/ watch movies/ hand out resumes in the rain day: We decide to hand a resume to Venus Envy, so we head to a bus and take the ride down there and get off and walk in. After looking and playing with all their products, we have a giggle at everything with a face.. and hand in a resume. After doing that, we went to a comic book place to check out the little, fluffy Gremlin stuffy we wanted to get for Kris's birthday, but upon entering, see Pucca (pretzel outside and chocolate inside!) and Collon candy (pastry outside, cream inside!) anyway, we head to Rideau for an actual meal, hand out a few more resumes in the Market and then head to the University to meet up with Kris before her exam. She bought herself some food and then brought us to a sitting area where we talked and had a good laugh. After that, she went to her class and we headed to Steff's Philo class. We got in, sat down, took out the gummi's and chowed down. After about 10minutes, we got up and left. It was horrible and we both agreed we could be doing better things. So, we headed for home, it had been raining all day, so we weren't so keen on staying out longer than we had too. On our way home, we got a few movies to watch. ""Helena, Helena, Helena... let's run away.. "" Oh man. Oh and ""a pocketful of ass..."" Anyway, those were our adventure days. Read Steff's journal for more details on our St. Patty's day. 
By the way, Pink Floyd show= love."

"event","I just finished reading Steff's post about our Tuesday adventures and her bottled up emotions and figured I'd post something of my own. 
So Tuesday was great, though she left out a few details about the excursions of the day. Like the fact that I split my coffee all over myself while sitting down, yet while trying to eat a muffin and hold onto a pole, I held onto it perfectly fine. She also left out the fact that I was her tour guide through the dead goat gallery. Oh and that I choked, many times, on gummi bears backstage and ended up throwing one on the ground for one of the actors to slip on. ;] Hm, there was also the button guy. I was the one that was trying to 'discreetly' take photos of his button, though I'm almost positive the entire bus including him knew what I was up too. It would of just been easier to tap him on the shoulder and ask if we could take a photo.. oh! She also failed to mention the walk from the bus to Centrepointe.. or the run/skip, it was fantastic, it really was. There was the library incident aswell, I managed to knock over a few books while being in a library for no longer than 20minutes, I'm amazing. I think that's it, the day pretty much consisted me, being an idiot, it was cool. 
Anyway, as per Steff's question of 'what are my defence mechanisms?' Well, usually I just pull away from the closest person to me, be it a friend, a lover, a family member, whoever I feel could reveal the most about me at the drop of a hat. This obvisously depends on the situation and what information could be leaked. I don't open up easily, it takes alot of prying to get to my inner workings and it's never easy. I don't like this trait, but it's the wall I put up. I'm usually quite elusive until I know I can trust you fully and wholeheartedly. I haven't been through as much heartache and pain as most of those around me, but I have been through alot of trivial things that've led me to behave the way I do. Perhaps I put this kind of wall up because I'm an only child? I never had anyone to 'confide' in as a kid, I didn't have that person that most can turn to, as no one was ever close enough to my life to know what it was that I was running from or why I was hiding what I was. Lately, I've been doing my best to keep certain things to myself as to not bring up MY insecurities and cause problems. I like the way things are now, though I'd like them far more if I were somewhere else.. but for now, this will have to do. I used to bottle everything imaginable up, from the stress of a school paper to a fight with my parents and I'd turn to writing or photos, but I've changed all of that. Now, I just simply don't care. Yes, I admit, there are times when it gets bad and I rant (sometimes to the wrong people), but it can't be helped, it gets to be such a heavy load that the smallest of things will set the ball rolling. Yes, during drinking binges I tend to reveal 'all' but I've alot more I don't tell, even my bestest of friends, just because I'm afraid of the reaction, of the treatment, the look. I tend to cofide in the one person I know will judge and have words; myself. But other than that, I just can't do it. The Brit knows alot more than most people I've known all my life, sometimes it's easier telling him certain kinds of things, like past relationships, hardships, heartache, yet sometimes I can't bring myself to tell him how I feel about HIM at a given time or tell him what it is that's bothering me. It probably seems like I just flat out don't want to tell him, which in turn seems like I'm hiding something, but I'm not. I just don't want him thinking I'm some kind of emotional wreck (like he doesn't know that already..) and I don't want him to think he's to do with any of this, not to say when I'm happy he's not part of it, it's just when I get moody or anxious or mad really quickly or easily, it usually means I've got something on my mind but don't want to share it. It's not that it's about you or that I've done something or said something I don't want you to know about, it's just that I have an issue and I'm to sort myself out. I've got the biggest mood swings of anyone I know and that tends to be a problem, I'm working on it. I've gone back to writing, I think that may help me tear down (a few) of the many walls I've built up so high. I've discovered that the ones closest to me, the ones I want nothing more than to tell them everything but am too scared of what they'll think of me, actually NEED and WANT to know every detail to my being. I've discovered that with outrageous fighting comes spectacular making up, with silly paranoia comes heartfelt honesty, and with unsaid words comes the best feeling ever; love. Little by little those in my life that have given me a chance are trudging across my rickety bridge, swimming my endless moat and tearing down my stone walls; they're getting in."

"event","It's been awhile since I've posted a decent update. So.. here it goes. 
For the past few weeks, I've been helping out at Orpheus, doing props. It's fun, slightly challenging but exciting to be around all the action of the theatre. 
Dress rehearsal starts on Thursday, and the show begins on Friday night, so from now until closing night, it's going to be intense. It was insane last night, most of the stage crew was missing, so props people had to fill in, as if being a first timer wasn't hard enough.. 
I was suppose to go to a show on Monday, but limited buses made it difficult. I'm kind of glad I didn't go though, apparently it sucked and not many people showed up. I'll make sure to get to the next one. 
Reading week was last week, a few of us heading to Quebec and stayed in a hotel for a few nights just so we could party it up before Liz and Allie went back to school. We had a good time, drinking, dancing and the occasional M&M fight. It was great. :) 
St. Patty's day is coming up soon, I've got a Pink Floyd show, but I think I'll skip out on that early and meet up with Robyn or something, much fun shall be had. 
Well, it would seem things seem to be going well for me, except for the whole job thing.. but other than that. I had been looking at schools in London, but the search has been holted for now, there's been a small delay. Though, the more I think about it, the more exciting it sounds. I still haven't decided what exactly I'd do, maybe just go over for awhile and check things out, see what I want to do, or maybe just take some random courses or something, we'll see what happens. 
The weather's getting much milder and alot of the snow's melting, it's wonderful! Bike riding soon! Though, I think it's supposed to snow or something stupid like that tomorrow.. 
I've got a coffee date in a few hours, oh how I've missed Timmie's."

falling into you. 
Pressed against a beating heart,

as my pulse races. 
Closing;
closing in on you.
An angels safe embrace

Eyes as piercing as a 
sparkling ocean
gazing through the murky colour

are my eyes. 
Running;
running to open arms,
running from the demons and shadows

The tenderness I give into;

"event","So, Rain was on Tuesday. My opinion: they were fantastic, though that could of been due to the fact that we were up front and centre. I would of taken pictures but cameras weren't allowed. I got a drink though, so that was cool. And I got to see the band up close, they smiled and such at the front row people, it was nice. The hall only fit about 300 people, so the show was very personal. 
Yesterday was the protest. I thought it went really well. A great turn out, considering the weather. We got free pitas and such for our efforts. Alot of chanting and shouting and booing and cheering and sign waving, it was great! We ended up getting pretty close the actual speakers on the stairs of Parliment, though we couldn't see them, we could sure hear them! They made some really good points and pointed out that there were protests going on all across Canada, so we'll be heard by someone, somewhere. Jack Layton was there on behalf of the NDP and Quebecious party, he didn't really talk alot about the issue, just about what HIS party would do if elected and such. Though, it was nice to know we have backing from political parties.

So, I've noticed I've been overly sensitive lately. I'm not quite sure why. I'm not usually emotional, possesive, jealous, envious... but recently, I've been a big green monster. Stupid things set me off and then I just stomp about sulking and being mad, about nothing in particular. I'm jealous of things I shouldn't be jealous over. I'm envious of things I shouldn't be envious of. I'm not one to sit silently and simmer over something for days on end, but I can't seem to help it. Anger has arisen and it just won't go away. I know everyone can see it, I don't make an effort to hide it. Perhaps I feel inadequate? Useless? Boring? I feel like I have to compete, knowing full well I don't, but each time I get angry, it's passed off as 'Oh, Cass is sulking again.. she's not talking to us.. she's fine though...' and the reason I got angry in the first place isn't taken into account, so it just continues.. not taking my feelings or concerns into consideration. You'd think by now, I'd of been able to control my feelings over certain things, but it doesn't seem possible. 
Anyway, I made banana chocolate chip muffins and am drinking Starbucks, all is well...for now. 

Oh, P.S. Le Garage on Satuday, come come come! Meet at Rideau at 8:30. :)

The show tonight is at the Casino theatre, so it's a Carabet setting, I'm looking forward to it, it should be interesting. We've got one of the tables up front, so I'll be able to SEE the band and be all Beatles fan crazy! It's going to be fantastic. 
Anyway, that's tonight. Tomorrow: the Lower Tutition Fees protest at Parliment. If you don't know about it, now you do, come! It starts at 11 at UOttawa Library. There's lounging and coffee beforehand starting at 7 at the school's lounge room, if anyone's interested. It'll be a full day thing with a party of sorts afterward. It should be cool, though dress warm! Ok, so that's Wednesday. Friday is Orpheus. I'm looking forward to doing this, it'll be fun. I helped Steff last year with the props and costumes and stuff, it was cool. So then Saturday: I was going to attempt to go to Winterlude, but I've recently found out that Liz is coming home for the day for a volleyball game! So we're going to go see her. :] Then, that night there's this concert thing at Le Garage in Quebec, it's free, so people should come. It starts at 8, I think, so it'll probably go till 11, at the earliest. Sunday: Winterlude! I want people to come down for the day, we can skate (though, I don't really skate...) do the whole ice sculpture thing, the snow playground, beavertails!, hot chocolate. So, if you're free Sunday, let me know. 
Anyway, be availible for Saturday night and Sunday and Wednesday!"

"event","Alright, so the past week or so has been drama filled. So much so that I'm to the point of drowning myself in self-pity, alcohol and writing materials. I never could grasp the concept of wallowing. I mean, I get the whole girls' night; drinking, dancing, ice cream, random people, fun. But sitting alone, drinking alone, sleeping all day just causes even more self-pity which leads one to go out and do something irrational and stupid just to boost self-confidence. My birthday for starters: it was decided, annoymously of course, that this years' just wasn't important enough for people to show up. So I made the best of it and drank the night away, pretty fiercely. It got alittle crazy and the dancing bit got alittle too 'personal' for me, but all in good fun, I suppose. I think we met some cool people while upstairs getting away from the guy that had pinned me against a wall.. though, I'm not sure. I remember sitting next to some guy that I didn't know and he was cool, as were his friends. Anyway, the next day wasn't so nice.. neither was the day after that. Many fights occured the following days, fights that were quiet, painful, long and strenous. Fighting about things long in the past, about bullshit, about nothing at all. I hate fighting, I avoid it if I can, but if there's no getting around it, I'm not going to back down and let the other person have the satisfaction of knowing they've beat me, simply because I don't WANT to argue-I'm going to stand my ground and win.
And to you, the one who's said I am just as stubborn and hardheaded as he: 
why would I jeopordize your trust in me, yet again? Why would I sit here and watch you struggle to get to me, only to let you find out I've got others, hundreds, according to you and your 'sources', who's information can't be wrong because they haven't got a reason to lie to you. Well, neither do I. I've worked hard to keep you, I'm not going to throw that away on something as trivial as this- I refuse. I mean, how many times do I have to prove to you that my feelings are genuine and true? How many times do I need to explain myself to you about something or another? How many times am I going to have to hear you tell me how sorry you are for being a dick and that it won't happen again? Am I going to hear how much of a bastard you are again? Because if so, no need, I already know. 

Anyway, I'm not going to run. I refuse to play that part. I refuse to let you believe what you've heard or seen. I won't get close to you, only to turn and hightail it out. I'm not like that, atleast I'm not like that with people that mean something. Though, I'm also not going to back down. I'm not going allow the crap that goes on to continue going on. Dish out everything you've got, I'm ready."

I'm going to be alone for most of the day, where's the fun in that? Oh well, my parents are taking me out for a nice meal, so that'll be something. And then Saturday's the big party day. I just kind of wish I was sharing this with someone, you know? It's a big monument, as was last years' and I hate to see it go by without someone special being beside me. 
Anyway, other than my birthday, I haven't any new news. I've been looking into taking some photo courses to fill up my days, or atleast a few of them. I kind of miss not being in school and I don't think I can wait until September. The courses I've been looking at are creative photography classes, they're abit on the expensive side but sound great! I'd get to take any kind of photos I wanted and be able to use the knowledge I already know to my advantage to make them better, with the help of a professional, of course. I'll be able to work with film and digital, black & white and colour. I'd also get to share my work with others and have the opportunity to study professional photos and see where I can improve. It sounds cool, I might sign up in March, see where it takes me. Well, I'm going to take my almost 19 self to bed and wake up to no one being home and hopefully presents left in my room..."

So, anyone that's available for the 27th, come out with us. We're going to party it up at Hot Shots, I think, then head over to Le Bop drink some more and then find other bars to go to. If anyone's got any suggestions, let me or Steff know, as she's planning it. 
Anyway, HopeSide was cool last week, I'd like to see them again. And I want my CD back, Steff.. 
Oh! On the 10th of Feburary there's another show, at Garage, everyone should come out to that too. Taking Back Sunday is also coming, March 27th, come to that too! 

I wanted you to know 
I love the way you laugh 
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away 
I keep your photograph; 
I know it serves me well 
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain 

Because I'm broken when I'm lonesome 
And I don't feel right when you're gone away 

You've gone away 
You don't feel me here, anymore

The worst is over now and we can breathe again 
I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away 
There's so much left to learn, 
and no one left to fight 
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

And I don't feel like I am strong enough

Though, it should be kind of cool, I'm looking forward to going out, I just wish everyone was going to be here for it. Stupid school, jobs.. least I won't have to buy my own drinks. ;] I got an early birthday present from Steff yesterday; the coolest shirt in the entire world and I got to have it made. It's amazing, I'm going to take pictures soon. Speaking of picutres, put the photos up from our clubbing night soon! And from New Year's! I need to get my camera good and fixed. 
Anyway, two job interviews on Tuesday, both looking good. Hopefully I'll have a job by the end of next week. Which reminds me, Cafe Dekcuf on Friday night. :] That'll be cool! 
So, I've been looking into it, and if I budget properly for the next nine months, I'll be able to study abroad. I'll have to see if I can get into the program, but I'll have the money so it'll be all good. And if that doesn't happen, atleast I'll have enough money to get my own place that isn't some shithole down the road from a crackhouse. Anyway, that'll be cool. 
Grr, I'm sick. I sound all horse-like, it's sad and of course, the phone rang like a zillion times today and I just flat-out refused to pick it up. Well, atleast during the day.. the evening call was ok. :]

What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do
Time Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true

Hey there Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me

Hey there Delilah
I know times are getting hard
But just believe me girl
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good

Hey there Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
and we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school 
And I'll be making history like I do
You know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there Delilah here's to you
This ones for you

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
What you do to me."

"event","So, it's December 10th, fifteen days before Christmas, twenty one days until the New Year and fourty four days until my 19th birthday. All things that I should be looking forward to, but I'm anxious, nervous, scared as hell though happy, relieved and feeling good about the whole thing, it can't come soon enough. I'll only ACTUALLY be looking forward to the New Year if our high commission doesn't look over the application and decide to look further into it and discover the mistruths.. I'm sure everything'll turn out just fine, there's just always that slight chance that something could go wrong, though if it does, I want it anyway SO much. I'm pretty much willing to do anything to get it. I've put too much time and energy into this to let it slip away that easily, as I keep telling him, 'everything'll be just fine' which it will. I was working today and I missed him, gay. I tried calling but my card ran out, gay. I find when I don't talk to him for a full twenty four hours I get lonely. I'm still not sure if that's good or not, but it happens and I can't stop it, no matter how hard I try. 

I've been awfully depressed lately, everything's just so.. drab. Everything is the same, it never changes and if it does, it changes for the worst. Steff recently lost a very close friend and I feel for her, I think that sort of pushed me over the edge- my breaking point. A good friend of mine is going through some other crap and I feel completely hopeless, I hate that feeling, I hate not being able to do anything to help the people closest to me. Oh, I've also discovered I haven't gotten the apartment I put money down for and the woman I was dealing with is being a complete cunt and won't return any of my calls, so I'm thinking I won't get that money back. It's kinda gay but I'm done dealing with it. Steff found me a few places to go check out this week, so I'll be doing that along with the rest of my Christmas shopping. I still have a few things I've got to send off, they probably won't get there for Christmas(as I was abit delayed getting it all together) but it'll still get there, that's good enough right? I suppose things'll look up after Christmas, after I figure out how to explain to my parents I'm moving out and starting a new life. That'll be interesting to say the least. 
What am I to expect when the time is right? Are things going to be normal? Will everything fall into place easily? Or will we have to work at it? Will it be the same as it is now? Will it change once we've met? How can I be sure he'll feel the same? I know I will, that'll never change, ever. But from his side of it.. he might be expecting something so much more, something so much better, something I can't be. What if he just doesn't like me? How will I cope with that? With knowing I dragged him here, only for him to discover he doesn't like me.. Everything I've ever done or said has been a reflection of me, a piece of what I am, I'm no different than what he's got already, but there's always that chance.. no surprises. 
The sun only shines when I'm thinking of you; the sun shines always."

Right, so I'm sitting here in a net cafe, wondering why I'm here. I guess the only reason is because I needed to get out of the house and needed a break from handing out resumes to useless people. If my phone worked, I could of called someone to tell him I would be here and we could be talking right now, but no.. of course it doesn't work. Bahh technology. Oh well, hopefully I'll see him tomorrow. 
So anyway, another screaming match of an evening last night. Apparently I'm not allowed to speak my mind in my house, or I get the ol' ""fuck off, get out of the house"" Eventually I stormed off and left. We'll see how things work out. 
So, Christmas is fast approaching. I've gone shopping and gotten a few things for people, I'll have to get on wrapping and sending 'em off though. Bah shipping and handling costs. Oh, I've always discovered that I'm getting a bunch of money for Christmas, that should help toward things. :) 
Oh! So I've decided I'm going to go back to school in August, take some photography courses.. maybe go to Algonquin with Alex, that'd be cool. 

Well, that's about all I have time for."

 Rocky Horror at the MayFair last night! We got all dressed up and bussed our way down there, looking like hookers-it was fantastic! We ran into Mel and her boyfriend, who's name I am afraid I will never remember, just before it started, they were dressed as Magenta and Riff Raff, it was cute. Everyone was so creative with their costumes, I was so proud! Props, singing, dancing, slutty outfits; it was definitely a night that will have to be repeated next year. ""It was a night they were going to remember for a very long time..."" 
I was alittle disappointed that actors didn't come out on stage and dance and sing along.. but it was made up by people shouting slut and asshole at the screen. :) 
 Anyway, so I've been told to celebrate Guy Fawks day. It's on the 5th of November, and drinking and fire will be involved, who's in? :) And even if we do get caught and try to claim we're just following the Queen, we'll be too drunk to remember! I think we should do it.

I'm sick, yet again and still feeling the remains of a Friday night hangover. :| Though, it was well worth it to see friends that have moved away and came back to visit for Turkey Day.

Clapton's set was awesome, with a few songs dearly missed. He didn't play 'Tears in Heaven' which was ashame, I love that song, nor did he play 'My Father's Eyes' another great. I was also hoping to hear abit of Cream, but seeing as he just finished up a tour with them, I figured he wouldn't play anything. He started the show with 'Pretender' and went straight to 'I shot the Sheriff', which he vamped up, quite nicely I might add. I'm not a fan of that song, but he sped up the beat a bit, and added extra vocals and such, making it almost a whole new song. Layla, of course was played, but not acoustic, which is my FAVOURITE version ever and he shortened it, it was disappointing but he made up for it with 'Cocaine' which lasted aleast 10 minutes. The encore was pretty great, he came back out with Robert Cray and played 'Crossroads' in a bluesy type sound, it sounded great. Oh and who could forget 'You look wonderful tonight', again cut alittle short for my liking, but AMAZING none the less. The guitar playing in each song was outstanding and lasted more than 6 minutes in more than half the songs- quite spectacular if you ask me. His band was awesome too, the two piano guys were amazing! The bass player.. wow. The lead guitarist was some famous guy's son.. he was young, but played with alot of experience, he played the acoustic set alone with Clapton, it was pretty amazing. Oh! I got a shirt! 
10$.. I was one happy girl! I took some photos, they aren't that great, seeing as we were kinda high up.. and to the side, but oh well. You can see the stage and SEE Eric, so it's all good.

Cause after all you do know best 
Try to slip past his defense 
Without granting innocence 
Lay down a list of what is wrong 
The things you've told him all along 
And pray to God he hears you 
And pray to God he hears you 

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up with you all night 
Had I known how to save a life 

As he begins to raise his voice 
You lower yours and grant him one last choice 
Drive until you lose the road 
Or break with the ones you've followed 
He will do one of two things 
He will admit to everything 
Or he'll say he's just not the same 
And you'll begin to wonder why you came 

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up with you all night 
Had I known how to save a life 

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up with you all night 
Had I known how to save a life 

How to save a life 
How to save a life 

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up with you all night 
Had I known how to save a life 

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up with you all night 
Had I known how to save a life

"event","So, we receieved some sad news early this morning; my Aunt, whom had found out only 3 months ago that she was pregnant, lost the baby. It was to be due on my birthday, January 23rd. She found out on Friday that the baby's heart was much too small to allow it to survive to full-term and all of it's organs were defective, as well it had brain legions. That poor thing.. my poor Aunt, she has to go in on Wednesday and ""give birth"" to something that isn't truly her baby. She'd been so excited about this baby it was almost unreal. Though, apparently this has nothing to do with the parents, it's one of those freak incidents that happens once in a blue-moon, they are encouraged to keep trying. I feel pretty useless and don't really know what to say to her..or to anyone. I was so excited to have a new cousin and on my birthday, that would of been cool. Well, I guess that was all I had to update. 
Hope you're having fun at Guelf, Marge and at Queen's Alli."

"event","On Monday Chisato, the Japanese exchange student, came back to visit and wanted to meet up with Cindy and I. So, we took her out yesterday. Our plan was to picnic, but unfortunately the weather was overcast and almost stopped us from going, but by the time we met up and got on a bus, it had stopped raining and had gotten alittle nicer out. We went down to Britiana beach and walked around for a bit then headed over to Andrew Haydon Park for some food and to feed ducks and take pictures. It's really nice down there. Much time will be spent there, that's for sure. Great photo opportunities. We fed ducks, squirrels, and a groundhog. We also chased seagulls.. lots of them. It was fun, I want to go again. 
Anyone wanna go down with me sometime?"

Bastard. 
Anyway, my photos have had a few offers to be bought.. 
People are actually interesting in spending money on them. 
Another photoshoot is definitely in order. I think I want to do a whole downtown theme. Morning, afternoon, evening, nightlife. 
If anyone's interested in coming down with me, I'll be going sometime this week. I just don't want to go alone because 1) I'll look like some super nerdy loser. 2) I'll look like some super nerdy loser..who looks like a tourist. There's a free cup of coffee in it for any taker(s).. I want to try to make a day of it. So, let me know when you're free and we'll head down. Steff, I think you mentioned you might be free.. 
Kris comes home soon! And then Alli and Marge leave.. 
I think we should go camping one more time before people leave. I love camping."

I wanna go out after work on Saturday. Who's free? I only work till 5. I wanna go eat or something.
I'm pretty sure the dentists of the world should all be gathered in one area and shot. Sent to Poland, maybe? That'd make me really happy.
Stupid cunts froze me today.

Oh, I'm trying to get things together to go to England in Decemeber. Like an early Christmas/birthday present, seeing as I'll be there from early December to early January, it'll be close enough to my 19th. 
It'll be great, also thinking of heading over to France after New Years. The only problem: finding a suitable place to stay, in England, until then. I've got family, somewhere.. I should give 'em a heads up on my visit. 
On a side note about Cindy living here.. we've inherited a bunny, Lola. :) She's Cindy's, but mine too, kinda.

Because that's all I seem to be hearing from the ones who have the unfortunate task of raising me. I can't seem to do anything right. I'm not going off to school right away, only because I refuse to let them pay, though, they probably couldn't pay it all even if I gave in and I don't have the money to pay it myself. I'd get a loan, but then I'd just have to pay it all back eventually, times a million, so what's the point? I'll go, just not right away. I'm just sick of having to live up to the standards of unrealistic dreams. I'm never going to be perfect, I'm never going to be a super genius, I'm not even going to be a normal genius.. I'm just not. I won't ever get a super job, I won't win the lottery and own a big house. I won't be able to live up to the standards that have been set before me. I won't live the seemingly perfect life they appear to live, I refuse. Moving out seems closer and closer with each day. Travelling around is another option. Once I've scrapped enough money together, I'll be boarding a plane to anywhere but here. 
On a lighter note, the photography thing seems to be taking off, this could be a promising career.."

"event","List 10 things you want to say to people but you know you never will
- Don't say who they are or who you're referring to
- Disable comments if you want
- Never discuss it again!

1. I miss you. I've made mistakes, and I've learned. I hate the way things ended and I hate that you're so far. If I could do things over again, I would and I'd do them right. I love you & always will. 

2. Get a fucking girlfriend. Stop whinning and complaining. You make fun of emo kids, you're a poser emo kid. So, shut up and get a girlfriend and make it last. 

3. We've had our share of bad times, perhaps more than needed, but it's made us that much closer. Love ya. 

4. You start playing her and I will hunt you down. You're already an ass in my books so anything you do will just make it worse. I'm not your friend, despite what you think. I hate you. You disgust me. Get your own friends, get a job, and pay for something, you lazy moneysucker. 

5. You're okay. A bit too cocky for me, but that's your stongest quality. :P With you around, things are always interesting, I'm glad we're friends. You're still an asshole, no matter how much you say you're not. :] Hang outs more, for sure. 

6. I've known you for years.. I fucked things up and we cut off all contact from each other. It sucked and I was crushed, but things were patched and we've talked. I still think the very best of you and hope to hang out more in the future. 

7. I miss you!! Come back! You're the best listener in the entire world and even though you didn't always understand what I was going through, you were so far from judging me, it was crazy. I love you for that. Don't ever change. I'll always be here for you. Call me sometime, you know the number. 

8. Phew, we've sure had our share of ups and downs.. for the downs, I apologize. Most of them were my fault. I can be a bitch for no reason and expect people to deal. I miss you. With everything I've done wrong, I must of done something right to have a friend like you by my side. You've got a huge heart and you always lent out good advice, even when I thought I didn't need it. You know me better than I know myself. Thank you. I love you. 

9. Where to start with you? Well, we've definitely been through it all. You're my best friend and I love you. At times, you need to open your eyes and see what's going on around you. Put your foot down if something is bothering you. You can't stand back and let people hurt you. You may be happy now.. but it won't last. You have to stop being fake. I know coming from me that isn't sound advice, but I know you better than you think. Just, watch out, be careful. I love you. 

10. You can always put a smile on my face. You're too cute to not like. We've sure shared some crazy experiences together, haven't we? I'm glad I got to share them with you. You're one of a kind and I want you to always know someone will always be thinking about you (those cute boys ;) 

11. I'm not sure where I'd be without you. The past two years I've gotten closer to you and we've definitely caused some 'trouble' ;] You need to get out more, experience everything. I'll help you, if you need it. 

12. You're crazy! I love you. We're definitely different, but we fit. You're stubborn and hardheaded, but sweet and kind. You make everything we do, fun. Hang outs more, fro shure, hoe. Call me. ;]

13. I've known you for.. almost 7years. We've drifted apart and found our way back together. We're just too different, I think. You're awesome though. You just need to have more confidence, more self-balance. I'd sit with you any day and looks at vintage cars. :]

14. Argh.. you honestly make my head explode. Because of you I've lost the one true thing I knew was real; me. You don't need to be in my life and I want you out. 

15. I'll make my way to come and hang out with you..eventually. You've been a really great friend. I watched you grow as a person and you've done a wonderful job. You've helped me stand a few times, thanks. 

16. I've known you forever. At times, you can be a slut, but I love you anyway. Have more self-pride, please. It saddens me to know the things you've done, or haven't done, but you let people talk about. Stand up for yourself. 

17. I fucking love you! I haven't been the best friend to you.. but I see that now and I know better. I let things get in the way of a true, honest friendship, it won't ever happen again. You've taken alot from me and forgiven me for things I wouldn't of forgiven myself for.. you're amazing. Do what you need to do in life and don't let others bring you down. I don't want to see you on the self-destructing path you once were on. I'll always be here. More hangs for sure. Beach party! Call me. ;]

18. You're nuts and I completely love you for it! You've got two beautiful children who I completely adore and you've got everything going for you. You saw things in me I didn't think were ever there, or could ever be there. You've given me so much confidence, so much self-value, so much to teach to others. I look up to you and know that we're going to be friends for a long time. Anytime you need a photographer, I'm there. 

19. You make me sad and depressed. I've recently gotten to know you and from the time I spent with you.. I went crazy and went through some pretty rough times. You were able to put personal issues aside and work on the project at hand, but you just seem so distracted. Get ahold of yourself before attempting to get into a heavy relationship.. you are a great person, you just need to find yourself. 

20. I've gotten to know you through a fantastic friend of mine. At first, we didn't really go, but I see what she sees in you, so I will give you the benefit of the doubt. But, stop stringing her along. 

21. You're a slut; deal with it. 

22. I hate you; you don't seem to get that. 


It feels good to get some of those things off my chest."

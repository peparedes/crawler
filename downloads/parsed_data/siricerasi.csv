And it was silent, so silent her ears rang and she could hear her heart beating too-fast in her chest. She&#39;d been dumped on the ground, as evidenced by bruises the screamed at her when she shifted, and god but the floor was <i>cold</i>. Her side <i>ached</i> from it, where she discovered she was laying in a puddle. Of what, she didn&rsquo;t really want to think about.</p><p></p><p>Cold, wet, and naked. Not the best way to wake up.</p><p></p><p>Still, at least she&rsquo;d woken up at all.</p><p></p><p>Her stomach rumbled suddenly, and she wondered how long she&rsquo;d been here. A day? Two? Her thirst was persistent but not debilitating, so no more than that. She wondered suddenly what had happened to the pancakes she&rsquo;d been making, wondered if they&rsquo;d burned or if Nathan had showed up in time to at least turn off the griddle so that The Grey Gull wouldn&rsquo;t burn down and Duke wouldn&rsquo;t hate her and oh god <i>Nathan</i>&hellip;</p><p></p><p>She&rsquo;d kill every one of them if they&rsquo;d hurt Nathan.</p><p></p><p>She grabbed onto that anger, let it simmer in her chest and gut and expand to fill her entire being. To block out the fear.</p><p></p><p>Fear would get her nowhere.</p><p></p><p>Her chest stung, where the taser probes had hit her, and she was almost glad it was too dark to see the wounds.</p><p></p><p>Focus.</p><p></p><p>She slowly pushed herself up, checking for injuries, but other than the taser and the goddamn cold she was in one piece. She waited for her eyes to adjust, hoping to at least figure out where she was being held, but it was so <i>dark</i>, not even a speck of light. As she climbed to her feet, fumbling around for a wall, she felt panic starting to well in her gut. The darkness seemed endless, cold and damp and so <i>empty</i>. She clamped down again, forcing one foot in front of the other, refusing to let her mind wander.</p><p></p><p>But god, it was good at that.</p><p></p><p>She&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve given anything to have Nathan here with her.</p><p></p><p><i>Nathan</i>.</p><p></p><p>Fear surged, but of a different kind, and she was damn well getting out of here if only to make sure he was okay (and maybe jump his bones). She kept walking, legs shaking a little from thirst and probably hunger and other things she didn&rsquo;t want to think about. A wall. She had to find a wall.</p><p></p><p>She did, nearly breaking her toe. It was rough, cold &ndash; concrete. Some sort of warehouse? Just keep walking.</p><p></p><p>And walking, and walking. One corner, two, three, and four. The place was <i>huge</i>, and there was no door, no windows or cracks, and suddenly she was unbearably exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Sleep seemed more productive than panic, anyway.</p><p></p><p>But damn, it was <i>cold</i>.</p><p></p><p>Still, she couldn&rsquo;t keep moving forever. And if her captors did ever decide to show up, she didn&rsquo;t want to have walked herself into exhaustion. So she sank wearily down against the cold wall, curled into a ball for warmth and sank into a restless sleep.</p><p></p><p>***</p><p></p><p>She woke to shouting.</p><p></p><p>There was a strange screeching, and suddenly cracks of light appeared in the far wall. She heard a shot and suddenly the wall exploded inward.</p><p></p><p>So that&rsquo;s where the door was.</p><p></p><p>It occurred to her that she should probably be concerned or at least curious, but she was tired and thirsty and hungry and so fucking cold.</p><p></p><p>&ldquo;Audrey!&rdquo; She&rsquo;d never been happier to hear her partner&rsquo;s voice. Even if it sounded strange &ndash; angry, <i>scared</i>.</p><p></p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she tried to say, but three days of no water and her throat was beyond dry. Still, she managed to at least croak out a noise that Nathan honed in on with disturbing speed across the rather large room. She remembered what he&rsquo;d said, about other senses being heightened, and wondered if her touch was as magnified and-.</p><p></p><p>Goddamn her non-stop brain.</p><p></p><p>He was running toward her, the flashlight in his hand bobbing up and down, and then she remembered she was naked. Very naked. It somehow seemed entirely unimportant now. She tried to stand, to make her way toward him, but her legs wouldn&rsquo;t cooperate and the most she could do was pull herself into a sitting position, knees to her chest in a vague display of modesty. He called her name again and again she tried to answer, then gave up and gave into being rescued.</p><p></p><p>Only by Nathan.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly he was there, light blinding her eyes so used to the darkness. He quickly turned it away from her face, to point it at the wall where it illuminated the ugly, stained concrete monstrosity.</p><p></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re naked,&rdquo; he stated. His face was pale, red eyes dark with lack of sleep, an expression of mixed relief and terror screwing his features, and suddenly she found herself laughing, hysterically. Nathan knelt quickly, taking off his jacket to wrap around her shoulders, and as his arms latched warmly around her she realized she was shaking, that her laughter had morphed somehow into strange, strangled sounds that sounded suspiciously like sobs. She found herself speechless for once, just leaned into her partner as he tucked her carefully under his chin, clutching at her desperately.</p><p></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay,&rdquo; he mumbled into her hair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay, Audrey, you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo;</p><p></p><p>She didn&rsquo;t have the energy to do anything but lay limply against him, every bit of fight she&rsquo;d been saving drained in an instant by his presence. She had never felt this safe with anyone, ever, never trusted anyone the way she did Nathan. It might&rsquo;ve just been the abduction and dehydration and hunger talking, but for the moment all she wanted to do was close her eyes, shut out the rest of the world and just let Nathan take care of everything. Of <i>her</i>.</p><p></p><p>She figured she deserved that after the last few days.</p><p></p><p>She was, however, devastatingly thirsty, and managed to croak out, &ldquo;Water?&rdquo;</p><p></p><p>She felt Nathan tense a little under her, demand, &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t give you any??&rdquo; She shook her head slightly, eyes still closed.</p><p></p><p>&ldquo;Never saw them.&rdquo; Nathan&rsquo;s fingers clenched where they gripped her arm, then released her as he fumbled for a waterbottle. She took a few frantic gulps before promptly spewing them back out over the floor, felt Nathan&rsquo;s hand grip her shoulder with terrifying strength.</p><p></p><p>&ldquo;Slowly,&rdquo; he reprimanded, a dull attempt at humor in his voice. She made a noise, leaned back against him and tried sipping instead, the water slipping beautifully down her parched throat. &ldquo;There you go.&rdquo; The fear was still there, an undercurrent he failed to keep from his voice.</p><p></p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; she tried to reassure him. He didn&rsquo;t even bother with an response, just stated tightly, &ldquo;EMTs will be here soon.&rdquo;</p><p></p><p>When she&rsquo;d finished the water she found herself far too exhausted to do anything but nestle closer to him, closing her eyes again as he wrapped his arms protectively around her.</p><p></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you,&rdquo; he whispered in her ear, as much for himself as for her, she thought. His voice flowed around her, eased the aching in her muscles, the gnawing in her stomach, the fear that had become such a knot in her gut she&rsquo;d all but forgotten it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna be fine, Audrey.&rdquo;</p><p></p><p>She knew she was, now that he was here.</p><br /></lj-cut><br /><p></p>"

Title/cut lyrics from &quot;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJWildQKC5U"">Alibi</a>&quot; by 30 Seconds To Mars

<lj-cut text=""so here we are, the witching hour / the quickest tongue to divide and devour"">&ldquo;So what&rsquo;d&rsquo;you think of her?&rdquo;

Dean blinked, shifted to stare down at the blonde head resting on his shoulder. Jaimie was playing with the fringe on his blanket, pointedly not looking at him or even really seeming to pay any attention. It wasn&rsquo;t like they were cuddling &ndash; they didn&rsquo;t do that. They&rsquo;d just happened to end up in a heap like this after sex, and they&rsquo;d both had some time to kill, so&hellip; they definitely weren&rsquo;t cuddling.

&ldquo;Of who?&rdquo; he asked absently, like he didn&rsquo;t know. Alex had brought some new chick in, another FBI agent who&rsquo;d just moved to LA. Or ex-FBI, actually. He wasn&rsquo;t sure why she was necessary, or why Carter had let her in. The team was getting entirely too big for his taste.

Jaimie kicked him with an annoyed noise, and Dean sighed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a fed,&rdquo; he answered.

&ldquo;Ex-fed.&rdquo; He rolled his eyes, brushed back her hair so he could see her face.

&ldquo;Okay, ex-fed. Who cares, Jaimie?&rdquo;

She was silent for a moment, chewing her lip absently. &ldquo;What if she finds out about me?&rdquo; Her voice was small, almost scared, and it tore something in his chest. Something he didn&rsquo;t really want to think about.

&ldquo;Then she finds out,&rdquo; he murmured, tightening his arm around her unconsciously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she will, sweetheart. Alex didn&rsquo;t, and she&rsquo;s been here a year.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Renee is different.&rdquo; She sounded so damn sure, almost resigned. Like she&rsquo;d already given up, which was&hellip; just something Jaimie didn&rsquo;t <i>do</i>.

So he shrugged a little, kissed her forehead gently. &ldquo;Even if she does, Jaimie, we&rsquo;ve got your back,&rdquo; he reassured her. &ldquo;Me, Carter, Ty &ndash; you <i>know </i>that.&rdquo; She hissed out a slow breath, nodding slightly as he ran a hand along her arm. She melted a little under his touch, tense muscles easing, and it wasn&rsquo;t cuddling if she needed it this badly, right?

&ldquo;Besides, I hear she&rsquo;s done some pretty shady shit herself,&rdquo; he said lightly, trying to put her mind at ease. He hated seeing her upset, more than he&rsquo;d like to admit. &ldquo;She is, as you pointed out, ex-FBI. I hear she tortured a guy so bad they fired her.&quot;

&ldquo;Sounds like Carter&rsquo;s kind of girl,&rdquo; she huffed. &ldquo;She can do all his dirty work.&rdquo;

He smiled, fingers playing lazily with her hair. &ldquo;Yeah, there was something involving a guy&rsquo;s thumb and a power saw?&rdquo; Jaimie didn&rsquo;t answer, and he decided for the thousandth time that he gave up trying to figure her out. &ldquo;Either way, sweetheart, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s gonna be a problem.&rdquo; Not with the amount of dirt Dean was sure he could dig up on the ex-fed; no way he&rsquo;d let this Renee hurt Jaimie.

Not that Jaimie needed to know how far he was willing to go for her.

Jaimie sighed. &ldquo;You always say that,&rdquo; she grumbled, shifting closer as she closed her eyes.

He smiled. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m usually right.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Asshole.&rdquo; But her body, warm and pliant and molded to his, spoke differently.

They were getting dressed later, about to head off to work, when he touched her arm gently, turned her toward him. She was still tense, clearly still spiraling in her head, and he hated to see her like that.

&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let her hurt you,&rdquo; he told her quietly. &ldquo;You know that, Jaimie. I&rsquo;ve got your back.&rdquo;

Her shy smile sent a dull heat spiraling through his gut, and he knew there was nothing he wouldn&rsquo;t do to keep that smile on her face.

***

It wasn&rsquo;t until a few weeks later, when Renee was helping Dean pack ammo, that he understood why Carter had hired her.

It was at least 100 degrees out, so she&rsquo;d finally shed the faded jacket she always wore and just had on a purple long sleeve shirt that brought out the bruises under her eyes. Well, she didn&rsquo;t sleep; point one. (He refused to think about how damn well he slept whenever he was with Jaimie.)

But then her sleeve caught on a zipper, and pulled up to expose her forearm, and suddenly Dean understood.

Carter always was a fucking bastard.

Dean wondered idly how bad it&rsquo;d been, if she&rsquo;d been hospitalized; the scars he saw before she yanked her sleeves down looked deep, still a dark angry red, and he put that together with the dead look in her eyes and suddenly he was too angry to breathe.

He stormed out of the loft, not even sure who he was angry at. Trying not to think about anything but the anger, because thinking about anything else&hellip;

Ten minutes later he was outside Jaimie&rsquo;s door, arms latched tightly around her the moment she opened it.

&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he choked into her shoulder, as she slowly rested her arms around him in shock. &ldquo;You know that right I love you.&rdquo;

She traced her fingers lightly along the back of his neck, making him shiver. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she murmured, kissing his cheek and holding him closer. &ldquo;Hey, hey, Dean, I know. I love you too.&rdquo; He shuddered, forced down the panic that threatened to flood his chest. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; she asked softly.

&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Nothing, I just&hellip;&rdquo; He shook his head into her shoulder, gulped down several shaky breaths. &ldquo;Carter&rsquo;s a bastard.&rdquo;

She laughed a little. &ldquo;We knew that, baby.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He slowed his breathing forcibly, drew calm from her warm, steady strength. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;

She let him hold her for another minute before pulling back, hands cupping his face. &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; she asked, eyes full of concern. Not that he could blame her; they were all so horrible at expressing any emotion, let alone fear. But something about Renee&hellip; he&rsquo;d always hoped Carter had some sort of limit, some line he wouldn&rsquo;t cross. That he wouldn&rsquo;t throw them all completely to the wolves, wouldn&rsquo;t let them self-destruct so totally.

He&rsquo;d been wrong, and it terrified him. For himself, and for Jaimie.

&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he rasped, trying to smile. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m okay. Just&hellip;&rdquo; He swallowed, and she ran her fingers through his short hair lightly.

&ldquo;Just you love me?&rdquo; she finished with a soft smile. He thought of Renee&rsquo;s dead eyes, flashed to that morning he&rsquo;d found Jaimie shaking beside her crashed car. That moment she&rsquo;d looked at him, strung out in her ripped black dress; that moment he&rsquo;d realized she was as fucked up as the rest of them. That moment he&rsquo;d realized she&rsquo;d do anything for Carter, from dying to selling herself to worse.

He wasn&rsquo;t sure he could ever compete with that.

He made a noise that sounded suspiciously like a sob, kissed her desperately. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he mumbled into her mouth, clutching her to him again. &ldquo;I love you and I need you please don&rsquo;t go anywhere.&rdquo;

He felt her start of surprise, the slow realization as she rested her head on his shoulder gently. &ldquo;Not planning to,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere, Dean. I promise. Okay?&rdquo;

He pulled back, hands on her shoulders and eyes boring into hers. No longer dead; haunted, yes, but not that hopeless apathy he&rsquo;d quickly grown to hate. The same emotionless gaze he&rsquo;d seen in the mirror every fucking day.

&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not her,&rdquo; he stated. She smiled softly, reaching up to rest one hand on his.

&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;And neither are you.&rdquo;

The edge of his lip twitched. &ldquo;Pretty sure we&rsquo;ve established that, sweetheart.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo; Her finger stroking the back of his hand was entirely too distracting. &ldquo;Maybe you should show me again.&rdquo;

As many times as it took, to keep that light in her eyes.</lj-cut>"

She watches him glances around the room, taking in all the photos, but when he looks back at her she sees none of the disgust she&rsquo;d feared, only concern and confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;Sweetheart, what happened?&rdquo; He touches her hands gently where they rest on her thighs and she jumps, automatically withdraws, and immediately feels guilty. The guarded worry on his face is disorienting, unexpected. He keeps his hand resting on her leg, rubbing his thumb along her skin soothingly, not letting her pull away. &ldquo;Jaimie,&rdquo; he murmurs again. &ldquo;Talk to me. Where&rsquo;d these come from?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin-top:12.0pt;"">She swallows and stares at his hand, focusing her eyes anywhere but the photos. &ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; she whispers, voice trembling despite her best efforts to keep it steady.</p><p>&ldquo;What does he want?&rdquo; His fingers reach out again to grip her hand, warm and reassuring against hers, cold and trembling. Somehow his touch, just that one little point of contact, is more comforting than any sex or drugs could ever be. She knows it should make her feel dirty, just reaffirms that she&rsquo;s a whore, a lying, conniving piece of crap, but it&rsquo;s <i>Dean</i> and it doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Jaimie.&rdquo; His gentle voice snaps her back to reality, soft in a way she rarely hears, and only ever for <i>her</i>. &ldquo;I thought you said he wouldn&rsquo;t be coming around?&rdquo;</p><p>She sighs shakily, shrugs a little. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think he would. Didn&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; She bites her tongue, squeezes her eyes shut tightly. This can&rsquo;t be happening, it <i>can&rsquo;t</i>.</p><p>Dean squeezes her hand a little. &ldquo;What does he want?&rdquo; he asks again quietly. She clenches her jaw, feels a single tear sneak under her eyelid and wipes at it furiously.</p><p>&ldquo;Same thing they did,&rdquo; she shrugs dismissively, gesturing wildly at the photos. Dean&rsquo;s face hardens, eyes glinting dangerously. &ldquo;Says after everything I put him through&hellip;&rdquo; she chokes. &ldquo;Says he deserves it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The hell he does.&rdquo; She almost doesn&rsquo;t recognize his growl, voice quiet and deadly. He grabs her chin when she starts to shake her head, forcing her eyes up to his. &ldquo;Jaimie. The guy is scum, okay? You don&rsquo;t owe him a thing, he&rsquo;s not <i>getting</i> a thing from you. You understand me?&rdquo;</p><p>A little piece inside of her dies. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m scum too?&rdquo; she whispers. She can&rsquo;t meet his gaze, feels like her pride and her spirit should be scattered around the floor like so many pictures.</p><p>But he won&rsquo;t let her look away, strokes her cheek gently with his thumb. She sees guilt and horror in his eyes, so genuine she knows she&rsquo;ll believe anything he says.</p><p>&ldquo;No, sweetheart,&rdquo; he murmurs. &ldquo;Jaimie, <i>you are not trash</i>. You are nothing like him.&rdquo; She wants to believe. She does. But Billy&rsquo;s voice is still echoing around inside her brain, words ringing far too true. He&rsquo;d known her for at least ten years; Dean has known her all of one.</p><p>She takes a shallow breath, turns her head out of his hand and stands. &ldquo;Sure. Fine. Just&hellip; just gimme a minute, okay? I&rsquo;ll be ready in five, meet you at your car.&rdquo;</p><p>He stands slowly, watching her with a look she can&rsquo;t even begin to decipher and isn&rsquo;t sure she wants to. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you gonna do?&rdquo; he asks quietly as she turns away, not wanting him to see her face. She wraps her arms tightly around herself.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; she mutters, kneeling again to start picking up the pictures with shaking hands.</p><p>He sighs, a frustrated edge to it. &ldquo;I worry, Jaimie.&rdquo; His tone bring tears to her eyes, kind in a way she can&rsquo;t understand, and she blinks them away furiously. She doesn&rsquo;t answer, knows her voice will break if she tries, and finally he just leaves.</p><p>She manages to keep herself under control until his footsteps fade, and only then does she let herself curl up on the floor and sob.</p><p>***</p><p>Dean doesn&rsquo;t worry.</p><p>It&rsquo;s just not in his nature. He leaves that to Carter, lets him destroy his brain wondering about the million possible outcomes; Dean just acts. Worry gets overrun by adrenaline, fades to almost excitement, or maybe anxiety, but not <i>worry.</i></p><p>Dean is worried.</p><p>Part of him hates Jaimie for it. He&rsquo;s gotten this far in relatively one piece strictly because he doesn&rsquo;t care, not about people or possessions (besides the occasional cold beer and his guns) or really his own safety. Because worry about any of those things could make him hesitate, and even a moment&rsquo;s hesitation could have gotten him dead a thousand times over.</p><p>Jaimie makes him completely stop in his tracks, and it&rsquo;s beyond frustrating &ndash; it&rsquo;s fucking <i>dangerous</i>.</p><p>But here he is.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been at least ten minutes and he&rsquo;s about to go back to her apartment when she appears, even paler than she&rsquo;d been when he&rsquo;d practically broken her door down.</p><p>The worry surges.</p><p>But he says nothing as she climbs into his car, knows that if he pushes her too hard she&rsquo;d just shut down completely on him, and possibly run. That scares him the most right now, the feeling he has that she might just pick up and leave at any moment. He doesn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d survive another move, another reset, and it bothers him more than it should.</p><p>He watches her for a moment, the way her jaw clenches, until finally he starts, &ldquo;Jaimie-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; she snaps. He raises an eyebrow, just looking at her, and she thumps her head back against the seat, closing her eyes. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she mutters. &ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; He desperately wants to touch her, comfort her, but he knows she&rsquo;d hate that. Knows she wants him to think she&rsquo;s unbreakable.</p><p>He&rsquo;d long ago learned that no one is unbreakable.</p><p>They sit in silence for a moment, and he desperately, desperately wants to ask if she&rsquo;s okay, wants to just <i>fix</i> it.</p><p>Instead he starts the car.</p><p>***</p><p>They spend the day trailing a lead, following him from gas station to coffee shop to strip club. Dean doesn&rsquo;t think Jaimie would&rsquo;ve noticed if the guy had danced around naked in front of her.</p><p>He takes her to his place that night, which she doesn&rsquo;t even realize until she&rsquo;s standing in his hallway and the door clicks behind them.</p><p>&ldquo;Dean&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not staying alone tonight,&rdquo; he tells her firmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sleep on the couch if you want, but there&rsquo;s no way in hell I&rsquo;m leaving you alone.&rdquo;</p><p>She sits down hard in one of his old wooden chairs, rests her head in her hands and starts to cry.</p><p>He kneels before her, brushes her hair back gently. He wants to tell her it&rsquo;ll be okay, it&rsquo;ll work out. But it won&rsquo;t be, so he doesn&rsquo;t. Instead her lifts her up, carries her to his bed as she wraps her arms so tightly around his neck he can hardly breathe.</p><p>He lays her down, pulls the blankets over them as he tucks her under his chin and curls around her protectively. He doesn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s ever had anyone to just hold her, keep her safe, and the thought of her alone tonight makes him nauseous.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; he breathes. She shudders, gives a tiny whimper that tears at his heart. &ldquo;Shh, I&rsquo;m right here, sweetheart. You&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll ever be able to leave her alone again.</p><p>***</p><p>The bed is cold when he wakes, and he&rsquo;s instantly alert. He slips silently from the bed, almost goes for his gun before he sees Jaimie&rsquo;s silhouette against the light filtering in the back door, sitting at the table.</p><p>He flicks a lamp on low and pads over, watching her blind rapidly against the light. She&rsquo;s clutching a mug of tea with white knuckles, knees to her chest.</p><p>&ldquo;How long&rsquo;ve you been awake?&rdquo; he asks softly, settling in a chair next to her. She shrugs, stares at the table blankly. &ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve woken me up, sweetheart.&rdquo;</p><p>She just trembles.</p><p>Dean sighs softly, reaches out to cup his hands gently around hers where they grip the mug. She swallows, blinking back tears as he strokes the back of one hand lightly with his thumb.</p><p>The worry returns, augmented by rage. All he wants to do is tear Billy&rsquo;s heart from his chest and feed it to him. He wants to hunt down every single man in those pictures and break every bone in their bodies, or make it so they never enjoy anyone&rsquo;s touch again.</p><p>But he swallows all of that, because he knows it&rsquo;s the last thing she needs.</p><p>Part of him wants to let her be, to just sit in silence and give her the space he knows she wants. But he also knows how easily she spirals in her head, knows that Scott&rsquo;s breakup with her is still far too fresh in her mind. He&rsquo;s fairly certain it didn&rsquo;t end well, to deal with this on top of everything else&hellip;</p><p>Her shallow, rapid breathing drags him from his thoughts. There&rsquo;s a crossword puzzle sitting on his table that she&rsquo;d clearly started, and he picks it up to find a blank clue.</p><p>&ldquo;Five letter word for &lsquo;chasm&rsquo;,&rdquo; he states into the silence. Her eyes flick up to his in surprise, pale face almost glowing in the dim light. He can feel her shaking, with one hand still covering her cold ones, but as they fill the puzzle in slowly she starts to calm down.</p><p>When he writes in the last word, Dean finds himself grinning. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;know, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever actually finished one of these.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should see my collection.&rdquo; Her voice is raspy, the full sentence almost sounding strange after an hour or two of one word answers.</p><p>He raises his eyebrows. &ldquo;You keep all of them?&rdquo; She smiles tightly, sadly.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you think I have in all those boxes?&rdquo; she responds bitterly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I have nice stuff of my own or things I&rsquo;ve collected over the years or-&rdquo; She chokes off, swallowing hard, and he feels his chest constrict tightly. He reaches out impulsively to take her hands again, squeezing tightly.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant,&rdquo; he says softly. And doesn&rsquo;t really know what else to tell her.</p><p>She retracts one hand to wipe furiously at her eyes. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she sniffs. &ldquo;I know, I just&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo; She bites her tongue, clearly struggling to control her voice. He runs his thumb reassuringly along her skin, wishes there were something he could say or do to make this any easier for her.</p><p>&ldquo;I ran away from home when I was sixteen,&rdquo; she tells him in a tiny voice. &ldquo;I ran away and left everything, everyone behind, and the next seven years are just a blur. I have nothing, no one from my whole damn life except&hellip;&rdquo; She gestures at the offending manila envelope sitting innocently on the kitchen counter, somehow taking up half the room.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember them.&rdquo; She glances at him hesitantly as she speaks, eyes flicking away as though afraid of what she might see. &ldquo;Or not clearly, anyway. Just&hellip; flashes, so many pieces blurred together&hellip;&rdquo; She shakes her head sharply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to remember, not any of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s asking you to,&rdquo; he murmurs, then amends, &ldquo;No one who matters.&rdquo;</p><p>She bites her lip, staring fixedly at her hands. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; she whispers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like&hellip; like they-&rdquo; She gestures back at the envelope on his bed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like it opened something in my head and I can&rsquo;t <i>stop</i> remembering.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s trembling again, he realizes. He&rsquo;d never fully appreciated how fragmented her past had been; he&rsquo;d always assumed the memories were there, even if she never talked about them.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to remember, Dean,&rdquo; she pleads. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can handle it.&rdquo;</p><p>He can&rsquo;t stand to see her so scared, so degraded.</p><p>He tugs at her hand, pulling her onto his lap where he wraps his arms tightly around her. &ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m going insane,&rdquo; she chokes, burying her face into his shoulder. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&hellip; I can&rsquo;t sleep, I can&rsquo;t get out my head, I keep&hellip; my memory keeps getting triggered by the smallest, randomest things and it&rsquo;s all so <i>real</i>&hellip;&rdquo; She sobs once, harshly.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey,&rdquo; he soothes, cupping her head gently with one hand. &ldquo;Okay, sweetheart, relax, breathe. I know it feels real but it&rsquo;s not, baby. That&rsquo;s all over, alright? You&rsquo;re safe here, you&rsquo;re safe with me.&rdquo;</p><p>She can only sob.</p><p>As he holds her trembling body, rocking her gently, her words slowly sink in. This couldn&rsquo;t all be about today &ndash; it <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>.</p><p>When she&rsquo;s calmed a little he asks softly, &ldquo;How long has this been going on, Jaimie?&rdquo;</p><p>She shudders, pulls back a little and swipes at her eyes with shaking hands. He can see her expression close off, can tell she&rsquo;s about to lie &ndash; and then a bone-weary exhaustion sweeps across her face, and she lays her head back against his shoulder. &ldquo;Since Billy came back,&rdquo; she mumbles. &ldquo;And Scott&hellip;&rdquo; Her little self-defacing shrug makes the rage flare.</p><p>He brushes her hair back from her eyes with disturbingly steady hands, and wonders when this anger will have a chance to vent. For a moment he&rsquo;s actually terrified of himself, but Jaimie&rsquo;s breath catches and all he can think of is her.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say anything?&rdquo; he whispers. His throat closes over with guilt as he thinks of her spending her nights alone, shaking in the dark, for all these weeks.</p><p>She laughs humorlessly. &ldquo;What would I say? &lsquo;Hey, I can&rsquo;t sleep or eat or fucking think straight because I&rsquo;m having flashbacks of when I was a fucking <i>criminal</i>?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>,&rdquo; he breathes, clutching her closer. &ldquo;You say whatever the hell you want, sweetheart, but just say <i>something</i>.&rdquo; He kisses her cheek lightly, feels an ugly despair settle into his chest when she just turns away. They&rsquo;re going to have to take some time off, he decides absently. If only because she can&rsquo;t function in the field like this. He wonders what he&rsquo;ll tell Carter, wonders how badly Jaimie will take it, wonders if she&rsquo;ll try to run, and his throat is closing up as the thoughts race around and Jaimie&rsquo;s spine is digging into his arm far too sharply.</p><p>Out of all the horrors in his mind the only thing he manages to voice is, &ldquo;You need to eat something,&rdquo; and then she&rsquo;s <i>laughing</i> against him because it&rsquo;s just so goddamn tiny against the weight of it all.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s something he can <i>fix</i>.</p><p>When her laugh turns somewhat hysterical he rubs a soothing hand along her back, tries desperately to calm her down, because if she has a panic attack or a breakdown on top of everything because of his stupid fucking inability to communicate he doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d ever forgive himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, let&rsquo;s figure all this out in the morning, okay?&rdquo; he murmurs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the middle of the night, and you&rsquo;re worn out and exhausted and everything always seems worse at night.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s rambling, he knows he is, but he doesn&rsquo;t know how else to help her. Her eyelids are fluttering against her pale skin, her dark eyes so <i>worn</i>, and all he wants to do is wrap her up in his arms and keep her here, safe and warm, forever. He knows how irrational that desire is, knows it goes against every survival instinct in his body, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop him from wanting it.</p><p>He almost wishes he could just stop caring.</p><p>She shifts a little and he can see her biting her lip, hesitation smeared across her face. &ldquo;You need some rest, honey,&rdquo; he pleads. &ldquo;I promise you, everything will look a little easier when you&rsquo;re not so tired. Just come back to bed, baby, please.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s fucking <i>begging</i>. It&rsquo;s an entirely new experience, and one he doesn&rsquo;t particularly enjoy. But it seems to work, as Jaimie nods slowly into his shoulder.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t even close his eyes after that, keeping watch over her rest. She looks haggard, gaunt in her sleep, curled against him. And he knows that even now she&rsquo;s probably the farthest person from helpless he knows, knows she&rsquo;s survived shit most people couldn&rsquo;t even imagine, but he can&rsquo;t help feeling like right now a wrong word, a rogue touch, could shatter her.</p><p>So he watches.</p><p>***</p><p>She wakes to rough sheets, the smell of coffee and tequila and <i>Dean</i>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the first morning in awhile that she doesn&rsquo;t want to curl back up and sleep forever.</p><p>Still, she never wants to leave this bed, this place. Never wants to leave Dean&rsquo;s side.</p><p>It&rsquo;s pathetic.</p><p>She blinks as he sits beside her with two mugs, smiling softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning, sweetheart,&rdquo; he murmurs. &ldquo;Coffee or tea?&rdquo;</p><p>She swallows against a dry throat, rasps, &ldquo;Tea.&rdquo; She pushes up against the headboard, taking a cup as he sips from the other. The sunlight filtering in is far too bright, and she mumbles, &ldquo;What time&rsquo;s it?&rdquo;</p><p>Dean shrugs. &ldquo;Around noon. Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo; As she looks closer she sees lines of exhaustion on his face, dark circles under his eyes. Guilt floods her chest, that she&rsquo;d brought him into this, that she&rsquo;d made him worry. She wants to protest, to say they really do need to worry about it and get to work, but one look at his face and her voice dies in her throat.</p><p>Instead, she asks, &ldquo;Did you sleep?&rdquo;</p><p>He snorts. &ldquo;Coming from the girl who hasn&rsquo;t slept in weeks? That&rsquo;s rich.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve slept,&rdquo; she protests weakly. Sure, a few hours here and there. Dean just raises an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, and I&rsquo;m the king of England.&rdquo; Jaimie makes a face. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d&rsquo;you want for breakfast?&rdquo;</p><p>She almost chokes on the hot tea. &ldquo;Careful, champ, you might turn into a nice guy here.&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugs, and the look on his face makes her want to run. &ldquo;Figured it&rsquo;s about time someone in your life was,&rdquo; he states. She swallows, closing her eyes against the emotion that floods her chest. And suddenly she can&rsquo;t breathe, feels the world tipping and warm hands grab her shoulders. &ldquo;Jaimie,&rdquo; Dean says. His voice drags her back as she sucks down air. &ldquo;Jaimie, sweetheart, look at me.&rdquo;</p><p>She does, feels tears spill down her cheeks at the compassion in his eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna work this out,&rdquo; he tells her gently. &ldquo;I promise you.&rdquo;</p><p>Later she&rsquo;s eating scrambled eggs and toast, her body tucked against his, and with food and warmth and safety she finally feels herself start to relax a little for the first time in weeks. She wants to cling to this moment, to never leave this bed.</p><p>Dean is running gentle fingers along her arm, grounding her with terrifying ease. And all she can is, &ldquo;This is <i>good</i>.&rdquo; He laughs.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sound so surprised. I&rsquo;ll have you know I&rsquo;m a very good cook when I get half a minute to try.&rdquo; She puts her plate aside and nuzzles a little deeper into his side, breathing in the smell of cheap linen and coffee. He kisses the top of her head lightly as she closes her eyes, and she finds herself whimpering at the sudden release of tension, built up over the past few months.</p><p>He tightens his arms around her a little, whispers, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you, baby.&rdquo; As she buries her face into his shoulder she lets the tears fall, lets a little of it just <i>go</i>. And he just sits with her, running a gentle hand along her back as she cries, and she&rsquo;s never felt more loved in her whole damn life.</p><p>How had she let herself push him away for so long?</p><p>(Because she doesn&rsquo;t deserve this.)</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you tell Carter?&rdquo; Her voice sounds harsh, grating to her ears as she struggles to shut her brain up.</p><p>&ldquo;Just that we needed the day,&rdquo; Dean murmurs. &ldquo;But&hellip; I&rsquo;m gonna hafta tell him something, Jaimie.&rdquo;</p><p>She sighs harshly. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; The last thing she wants is for their boss to know how on the edge she is right now, how little she trusts herself. Dean reaches up to stroke her hair, fingernails scratching gently against her scalp, and she shivers with pleasure.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me tell him about Billy,&rdquo; he pleads. &ldquo;Please, Jaimie, let us help you.&rdquo; God, she wants to. She desperately just wants this to go away, all of it. But they don&rsquo;t deserve to be pulled into this; it&rsquo;s her mess, her fault.</p><p>&ldquo;I need to do this on my own,&rdquo; she mumbles. She feels his body tense, can tell how much effort it&rsquo;s taking to keep himself under control.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asks, voice very carefully neutral and quivering with forced calm. &ldquo;Why the <i>hell</i> should you have to do this alone, Jaimie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my problem, my fault. My responsibility.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The hell it is.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s practically vibrating with anger now, and she has absolutely no idea who it&rsquo;s directed at. &ldquo;I looked at his file, after we closed the case. Assault, murder, possession, pimping&hellip; Billy isn&rsquo;t a nice guy, Jaimie. And I&rsquo;m guessing you didn&rsquo;t have a lot of say in what happened in those pictures.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t all fucking rape me,&rdquo; she snaps, pulling away to stand. Just because she doesn&rsquo;t remember details doesn&rsquo;t make that false, and she won&rsquo;t let herself be a victim. She will <i>not</i>. She backs up against the wall with arms folded tightly across her chest.</p><p>Dean slowly stands. &ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t remember?&rdquo; he says softly. &ldquo;Sweetheart, even if you weren&rsquo;t raped you are clearly so drugged in these you can&rsquo;t be in any position to be consenting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; she hisses, squeezing her eyes shut tightly. The memories flash, like a broken camera on repeat, over and over and over and she <i>can&rsquo;t remember</i>. Not the time, or the place, not anything but the feeling of skin on skin and sweat and-</p><p>&ldquo;How did Billy get these?&rdquo;</p><p>She freezes. &ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she stutters, shocked. &ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Dean is close enough now to place his hands gently on her shoulders. She thinks his presence should feel confining, terrifying, but it doesn&rsquo;t. It only feels safe.</p><p>If only he&rsquo;d shut up.</p><p>&ldquo;He pimped you out,&rdquo; he murmurs, running his thumbs along her skin. &ldquo;He kept you so addicted you couldn&rsquo;t tell one guy from the next, he used the drugs as your payment and he took these pictures&hellip;&rdquo; She watches him swallow hard, feels bile rising in her throat. She&rsquo;d always known Billy wanted, but this&hellip;</p><p>She bolts to the bathroom and throws up all of Dean&rsquo;s nicely cooked breakfast.</p><p>She feels his hands steady her, one hand rubbing her back soothingly as her body spasms, slowly quieting. He pulls her back against him when she starts to cry, harshly, wraps his arms so tightly around her she can hardly breathe.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault,&rdquo; he breathes, rocking her slowly. &ldquo;You were just a kid, sweetheart, it <i>wasn&rsquo;t your fault</i>. And you don&rsquo;t owe Billy a goddamn thing, you understand me?&rdquo;</p><p>All she can do is sob.</p><p>It takes many long minutes before she can control herself enough to breathe properly. And Dean just sits with her, still rubbing her back, and she <i>doesn&rsquo;t deserve him</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;I puked up your breakfast,&rdquo; she whispers, because it&rsquo;s the only thing she can find to say. He laughs a little, smoothing back her hair.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I need some practice still.&rdquo; He runs a hand in gentle circles on her stomach, kissing her forehead. &ldquo;I see what you meant by you can&rsquo;t eat,&rdquo; he murmurs, and she winces.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not normally so bad,&rdquo; she mumbles.</p><p>&ldquo;Or you just normally don&rsquo;t eat.&rdquo; His words ring in her ears with soft clarity, and all she can do is turn her face into his shoulder. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna figure this out, Jaimie,&rdquo; he tells her firmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna let that asshole ruin your life again. Neither are you.&rdquo;</p><p>She nods against him, still struggling to breathe. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she says in a small voice. &ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m sorry, I should be able to handle this-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant,&rdquo; he breaks in gently. &ldquo;I just&hellip; This is the one thing I&rsquo;m good at, sweetheart. I know I&rsquo;m not a good friend, or boyfriend, or&hellip; hell, I&rsquo;m not a very good person, but taking down bad guys? I can do that.&rdquo;</p><p>She trembles.</p><p>&ldquo;Please let me help you,&rdquo; he whispers, lips right by her ear. &ldquo;<i>Please</i>.&rdquo; She nods, tears streaming down her cheeks, and he holds her until long after her shaking fades.</p><p>***</p><p>He bursts through Jaimie&rsquo;s door with gun up, hands steady. Billy yelps, cowardly asshole that he is.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; the bastard shrieks. &ldquo;I told her-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, you told her a lot of things,&rdquo; Dean cuts him off with dangerous calm. The rage runs strong, pulsing greater with each breath, as it has since Billy had called Jaimie twenty-odd minutes ago.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d drawled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little hurt there&rsquo;s no pictures of me. Actually, Jaimie, there&rsquo;s no pictures at all, there&rsquo;s&hellip; nothing here. This place is sterile.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Jaimie was pale, so white Dean had been afraid she&rsquo;d pass out.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You know what&rsquo;s missing?&rdquo; Billy had asked. &ldquo;You, Jaimie.&rdquo;</i></p><p>And so the rage had grown, stronger and hotter in his gut, until he was nauseous with it&rsquo;s power. And now, finally, it had something to latch onto.</p><p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t check in with a few friends of mine, some very nasty packages are going to be sent,&rdquo; Billy was saying. &ldquo;So Jaimie had better get her pretty little ass over here. She owes me.</p><p>Dean blinks. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he states, voice emotionless.</p><p>&ldquo;The little whore-&rdquo;</p><p>Dean pulls the trigger.</p><p>The bastard is screaming on the floor, hand pressed against his leg that&rsquo;s bleeding red all over Jaimie&rsquo;s carpet. His first thought is it&rsquo;s going to be a bitch getting that stain out.</p><p>He&rsquo;s on his knees in front of the huddled form, gun cocked to Billy&rsquo;s temple. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to call your friends,&rdquo; he croons. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to tell them to burn those packages. You&rsquo;re going to tell me where any copies you have are, and you are going to forget you ever knew a girl named Jaimie.&rdquo; Billy spits, breathing harshly, complexion already sickly. Dean yanks his head back by his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;You fucking <i>shot me</i>,&rdquo; he whimpers, and Dean smiles slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;Next bullet goes in your brain.&rdquo; Billy stares at him, eyes wild with pain, and chokes, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cop, you wouldn&rsquo;t-&rdquo; Dean releases his hair to jam his fingers into the gunshot wound.</p><p>Billy <i>screams</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say I&rsquo;m not your typical cop,&rdquo; Dean tells him steadily. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t do exactly what I say, I&rsquo;m going to kill you.&rdquo; He pauses, cocks his head. &ldquo;Eventually. Or maybe I&rsquo;ll just cuff you to the table and leave you here to bleed out. A wound like that, it&rsquo;ll take hours.&rdquo; Fear flashes stronger across Billy&rsquo;s face, and Dean knows he&rsquo;s really not cut out for this.</p><p>The coward makes the call.</p><p>&ldquo;Now get me a fucking ambulance,&rdquo; he shrieks through gritted teeth, now almost writhing on the floor. Dean stares at him, feels the rage growling in his gut. He wants to beat the bastard until he no longer has a face, wants to cut at him until his body is unrecognizable.</p><p>He looks down at his bloody hands, and realizes they&rsquo;re shaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get one thing straight,&rdquo; he purrs. &ldquo;You think about opening your big mouth &ndash; about me, about Jaimie, about anything but yes sir no sir how high sir &ndash; you remember this. I know a lot of people in a lot of lockups. A lot of bad people. Some of them I&rsquo;d almost consider friends.&rdquo; He leans closer, nose almost touching Billy&rsquo;s sweaty forehead. &ldquo;They could make your life very, very unpleasant,&rdquo; he breathes. Billy pants, nodding rapidly.</p><p>Dean calls it in.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;You make me do very, very stupid things.&rdquo;</p><p>Jaimie looks up at him as he walks in the door, her face a mask of calm with terror seething in her eyes. He realizes she&rsquo;s staring at his hands and looks down, finds them still covered in Billy&rsquo;s blood.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he states.</p><p>She approaches him, pointedly takes his red-stained hand and guides him to the bathroom. She turns the shower on, scalding hot, and strips their clothes with hands he thinks might be trembling. When they enter the streaming water he just watches the pink stream down the drain, irregular patterns that won&rsquo;t let him look away.</p><p>Jaimie kisses him, gently, taking his hands in hers. She breaks off, starts to rub lightly at the stains and whispers, &ldquo;Billy?&rdquo;</p><p>Dean swallows. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be coming around anytime soon.&rdquo; She bites her lip, and he sighs. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s with Carter, off to be incarcerated. Carter didn&rsquo;t ask questions.&rdquo; He hisses a breath, mumbles, &ldquo;I shot him. I shot him in the leg and I almost left him there to bleed out on your fucking carpet.&rdquo;</p><p>She shudders, violently, and suddenly his mouth is on hers and he can&rsquo;t pull her close enough. She wraps her arms around him, holding him tightly, and whispers, &ldquo;I almost wish you had.&rdquo; He chokes, buries his face into the crook of her neck as her fingers trace lines along his back.</p><p>When she murmurs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; into his skin he jerks back.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he states, as though simply by saying it he could make it true. &ldquo;No, Jaimie.&rdquo;</p><p>He stands with her in the spray until the water runs cold, rubs at his hands until he thinks some of the blood running pink down the drain might be his own.</p><p>***</p><p>She burns the folder.</p><p>A few days later he hands her an envelope &ndash; small, white and wrinkled. She looks at him hesitantly and he smiles, nodding at it. She pulls out a photo of the four of them, laughing together at a bar after closing a case.</p><p>&ldquo;For your new apartment,&rdquo; he tells her lightly. &ldquo;Your new home.&rdquo; She just stares at the picture for a moment, then looks at him with such gratitude it almost brings tears to his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she whispers. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p></lj-cut><br /><p></p>"

"event","Me posting ANOTHER story? WTF is wrong with me?? I&#39;m pretty freaking proud of this, it&#39;s at least six months in the making. It&#39;s too bad no one actually watched Dark Blue *sigh*&nbsp;<b><br /><br />Title</b>: Complications<br /><b>Author</b>: <lj user=""siricerasi"" /><br /><b>Artist</b>: <lj user=""katekat1010"" /><br /><b>Fandom</b>: Dark Blue<br /><b>Pairing</b>: Jaimie/Dean<br /><b>Rating</b>: R (M)<br /><b>Length</b>: 32,502<br /><b>Warnings</b>: There&#39;s nothing drastically graphic, but if the subjects offend you it&#39;s probably best not to read. This fic is dark and angsty - there is certainly fluff, but it deals with rape, child &amp; adult abuse, drug use, &amp; suicidality. So I say again, if this bothers you, don&#39;t read!<br /><b>Notes</b>: This story loosely follows season 1 canon, so obviously major spoilers for that. I&#39;ve kind of ignored the fact that season 2 exists, because I was pretty angry with where they took these two. And it&#39;s my fic so I&#39;ll write what I damn well please =P<br /><b>Summary</b>: Jaimie Allen has been on the run from her past for most of her life. Dean Bendis has been trying to hold himself separate from the rest of humanity. When Jaimie joins Dean&#39;s team on the LAPD, they both find themselves closer than they&#39;d expected, and wanting more even when they both know it&#39;s wrong, dangerous, complicated.<br /><br />Link to <a href=""http://kink-bigbang.livejournal.com/80341.html"">Master Index</a><br /><br />My artist made a seriously freaking awesome poster for me!!<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Cut for art""><img alt="""" src=""http://www.mediafire.com/imgbnc.php/f02740e993c075853563c9fad873b9af62e39ef3ce14281b278e1cd34ca112bd6g.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid;"" /></lj-cut>"

Unfortunately not exaggerating. So yeah, I've listened to these songs at least 20 times each and have been fiddling with the content / order like whoa and I'm pretty damn proud of it. 

It's two mixes, but really just two parts of the same one.

Err. There are incredibly detailed and complicated reasons for the placement of each song but I'm pretty sure no one cares but me lol. 

Anyway! 

<strong>Medium</strong>: TV 
<strong>Fandom</strong>: 24 
<strong>Subject</strong>: Renee Walker 
<strong>Title</strong>: Clock Spinning Round / One Flat Foot On The Devil's Wing 
<strong>Warnings</strong>: Spoilers for 8.04 
<strong>Notes</strong>: This mix is very Dark. Dark. As in depressing, dealing with suicide / self-harm, nothing light and fluffy, no redeeming qualities whatsoever. DARK.

"event","<br />So I just spent at least 3 hours making this recap, ha. Oops. Well, I just took a midterm and got a FUCKING 98 so I deserve it. And I've been up since 4am. And I probably wouldn't have gotten anything useful done anyway.<br /><br />Dear self: good point.<br /><br />But really, 24 needs to stop demanding such detailed recaps or my academic career is going to suffer, ha.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""24 8.06 picspam!!"">So... nothing really happened in this episode. Hassan went Wacko way too fast, Sark was pretty and a cute brother, Katee was almost nonexistent, Leoben was his usual freaky self, and Renee was Super Fucked Up.<br /><br />&quot;No, she doesn't care what happens to her, that's what makes her dangerous. She's like a bomb ready to go off.&quot; Yep, that basically sums up this episode.<br /><br />&quot;If you're saying what I think you are, we don't do that anymore.&quot; I still haven't been able to decide if this show is right or left. I mean, from that I'd say left. But then we have the stereotypical middle eastern men with nukes and government crackdowns an such, and I'm not sure anymore. Also, suddenly Jack switches back to being badass? What? He needs to make up his mind. He can't tell Renee she can't torture people and then go torture people to get Renee out of having to torture people. Um, what?<br /><br />Ha, I love how much Hastings cares. &quot;As long as you can do it without risking the mission.&quot; He CLEARLY hasn't met the Goa'uld. Remember this?<br /><br /><strong>Apophis</strong>: A single human life is worth so much that you'd risk a world?<br /><strong>Jack O'Neill</strong>: That's right. That's why they call us the good guys. <br /><br />Hastings needs to meet some aliens hell-bent on destroying his world, man. Or some cylons. Or something. Sometimes I think humanity really needs an apocalypse.<br /><br />Uh yeah, anyway. It's Katee, and she's not happy. She TOTALLY jumps when Hastings says &quot;Dana.&quot; How do you even go about training yourself to respond to a new name?<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i107/darkchild912/24/8-06/1.jpg"" /><br /><br />Also, why are there like no scenes between her and Cole? I actually kind of liked them (and him). I didn't think I'd want more of him, but I do, dammit.<br /><br />Boo, looking up stuff for Kreeper Kevin. Our Katee is so talented she even manages to look ridiculously upset just looking at a computer screen.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i107/darkchild912/24/8-06/2.jpg"" /><br /><br />&quot;It's me, I've got something.&quot;<br />&quot;Damn, you're fast. Ok.&quot;<br /><br />Even being bad, she WINS.<br /><br />SO let's see. Either she really does help Kevin out, and they get away with it. Unlikely. OR she gets caught, and starts crying and gets kicked out and Cole has a horrible shocked look on his face and everyone's suprised that Miss Perfect is Not So Much. Also unlikely. Or rather, predictable, which doesn't mean unlikely.<br /><br />What I'm REALLY hoping for is that Chloe will figure out what's going on (I mean, obviously she's already suspicious). And together they will take down Kreeper. My theory is Dana's hoping to somehow get Kevin in and then get him caught, but I'm not sure how she's gonna do that without exposing herself. Maybe Chloe can come in there!<br /><br />Or maybe she really wasn't doing anything illegal (er, before helping them steal drug money), and just changed her name legally to hide from Kevin. I mean, it sounds like she served her jail time. And just because she was bad as a teen doesn't mean she's bad now, although it does seem rather implausible that the government would hire someone with a criminal record. Not like this show is plausible anyway, so I can hope.<br /><br />&quot;What's the plan.&quot;<br />&quot;You go in and take it.&quot; LOL. Literal LOL.<br /><br />Ew, Arlo the sleezebag. I REALLY DISLIKE HIM. Seriously, Chloe and Katee need to gang up on him like whoa.<br /><br />Pretty and creepy. I can't help myself.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i107/darkchild912/24/8-06/3.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i107/darkchild912/24/8-06/4.jpg"" /><br /><br />And it amuses me slightly that this Leoben doesn't even want to get anywhere near nuclear material when the other one helped nuke 12 planets. Downgrading much? Also, he's like totally desparate to get Renee to work with him. Sucks when you can't just lock her in a room and play house.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i107/darkchild912/24/8-06/5.jpg"" /><br /><br />&quot;There's no one I trust more.

And you'd think Vlad would actually have had security, which would have ruined this whole thing. <br /><br />Oh but I forgot, this show isn't plausible.<br /><br />Aww, it's Sark, and he's cute. I like him much better with a british accent, though. Also, what's a good guy like him doing dealing nuclear materials? I mean, he seems like a pretty nice guy.

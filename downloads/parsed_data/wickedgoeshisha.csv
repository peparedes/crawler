"event","olaaa!!okeh..we did some talk on what we want to do and what we need to do.choosing our group name and some other things.the word "" wicked "" had a story... actually we get the name from a legendary man that is Cik Mat Poi...You must been wondering who is Cik Mat Poi or CMP..... CMP is originally came from a TV show called AC Di sini? you must get your own astro to see this legendary man, CMP.... actually this show at first didn't make much impact in our life....but one day in Low Yat plaza, while we was wondering around, one of us said ""wicked ah lu, wiccked ah lu...sempoii...."" with a pleasant voice...we burst into laughter and we thought it's kind of cool having a trademark...then we were inspired by that word ever since that day.....so our name group is ""WICKED""....thanks to people who has been helping introducing this word like akim, azwan, asnol and not forgetting our man, paan....peace yo!!!
hahaha..what an entry!lousy!!this picture here is the CMP=p

wuhuu~we got our group set and wallah~there goes our group name..'wicked'..haha..what a name..ok..in out tutorial class on 9 November 2006, we have planned on how to make our interactive application project done. At first we got all those standard ideas on Malaysia's cuisine..something on Malaysians clothing..but then after hearing and looking what other group does, we change our mind.
we listed some crazy thing and waits for the group consultation..we wanted to do about shopping at first..but then..after consulting, Cik Jee suggested we should do about shisha..so after considering the idea given, we take the idea of the shopping thing and change it to this shisha thing..hahaa..we hope we will have a good final product then!"

"event","been a long time huh? i've been pretty damn busy myself, been on vacation from the wonderful world of retail, just to end up working some extra hours at gamestop, what fun! let me get to before the vacation first, on the 26th of June my brother and his girl came in, they have been in italy for about 2 years. there flight got screwed because she didn't have a return ticket (travel agency fuck up) and shes not a us resident (or wasn't). they finally get home, and we all have a good time catching up etc.

now down to the 17th of July, my brothers wedding, not bad for $60 and 1 week planning, his original wedding in vienna got postponed and turned into this one :-/
but it was a great wedding :) 

they left the next day for there honeymoon in lewisburg (my grandparents house). my grandparents basically live in a big vacation/camp place out in the middle of nowhere, nice place though quiet, down by the river w/ easy access for fishing swimming ect. my grandparents arranged a cabin for them to stay in from one of the locals, and it was a damn nice place (must be nice to have money). they went up about a week before me because i had to finish out work before my vacation.

now down to my vacation, left on wed for lewisburg (a day early), the drive was boring all alone i don't see how jeff can drive to canada by himself when i can't stand a 2 and a half hour drive.. bleh. got there and spent the first couple of days with my brother and my new sister-in law, shes a great girl, im happy for him to find somebody like her :)

after the first few days we go and stay with my grandparents for a few days, and make the trip back home tt charleston, not such a boring trip with people to talk too. get home, and from then on i basically work hours im not supposed to (thanks jeff :-P).

last night i finally got around to taking jeff to bennigens, one down one to go. now im wondering how im gonna get up Monday morning at 4am for work, when i haven't been going to bed till 6am all fucking week. and trying to catch up on the pile of anime i had come in while i was on vacation and busy all month.. 

and last jeff is trying to organize an anime con here in charleston for next September, gonna be a shit load of work, but im looking forward too it, we seem to have a bunch of little otaku fucks willing to come so far :) hopefully it goes well and we might try for a second/third year and so on.

but right now im done with this long winded ass post in my lj, i feel like a koala bear just crapped a rainbow im my brain so im gonna finish up noir v5 and get my ass to bed.. laidher"

"event","that's a miracle in itself :)
today was another wonderful day at work, thanks to that stupid arrogant manager the other day at least. i was left in charge Sunday with the manager/asst manager off so i was running things, and all went well till the last hour of work. i was supposed to make out an order for today, did that then i needed to get a telexon to scan the order, spent 30 mins looking for my depts telexon only to find out that it was borrowed without my permission . i finally got it back to find out that the stupid bitch that stole it dropped it and broke it, no big deal they only cost a little over $1000. so i go down to the meat dept and ask to borrow there telexon only to find its locked up, i page for the manager and 20 mins later he comes to unlock it. keep in mind i only had 10 mins left to scan a order that's 98 pages long and takes well over half an hour. the meat manager being the asshole he is refuses to left me use his until his guys (who all get off an hour after i do) scan there orders. leaving me clustefucked, so i ask the bakery manager to scan my order since she didn't get off work till 9pm. i actually thought her being a manger and all that she would know what the fuck she was doing, boy was i wrong, our order is separated by two categories, item and case quantity, so say i wanted 40 cases of corn i need to order 40 case quantity. well she ordered 40 item quantity, its packed in 50 quantity so guess how many cases we got 1! our whole order came in that way, 4 pallets of produce to last 2 days in a store that sells $10,000+ on a slow day. clusterfucked again.. so we had to get produce from a local supplier (corey brothers produce on smith street). they don't have any trucks scheduled today, so i got to make trips in my truck along with another guy in his truck, we only had to make 6 trips each! i spent my day from 7:30am-1:30pm driving back and forth from work to coreys. and when i get back t work for the last time they want me to take my hour lunch, by the time i got the last load up on the dock and in the store it was 2pm, my 8 hours was up, fuck clocking out for an hour lunch and staying there for an hour just to punch back in and hour later wait one minuite and punch out for the day.. what a bunch of morons. ending my rant fuck work, fuck people, and fuck fuck!"

"event","yesterday at work was a fucking trip, this kid came in with his mother, and i noticed he wasn't quite all there, maybe down syndrome or something of that sort. so i do my best to be as nice as possible and he tells me he wants to buy street fighter alpha 2. i look and we didn't have the game and so i tell them we don't have it. the poor fella just started tapping me on the shoulder and saying ""i wanna buy street fighter alpha 2"" finally his mom promises to buy it online for him when they get home and they leave. no more than five minuites later he comes running back in with his mom chasing close behing screaming loud as hell ""ITS A TRICK ITS A TRICK"" i just about fucking lost it, i wanted to crawl up under the counter and piss my self laughing... i know its wrong but that just hit me wrong.. funny as hell yet not."

As October comes to a close, I've decided to close this site too. I'm moving out. Where to? Only <a href=""http://ohoneohoneoneoh.livejournal.com/friends"">friends</a> would <a href=""http://ohoneohoneoneoh.livejournal.com/13223.html"">know</a>.

This journal will be purged soon.

Japanese Eyes</center>

<i><b>I appreciate my eyes.</b>
I like the fact that my eyes are contoured in a chinky manner, deep-set in an unorthodox way. I like how my eyes are unique. And like how, at some angles, my eyes look lined with eyeliner when there is really none. I like how my eyes reveal myself more than I can ever say, and yet conceal so much more than what I try to hide. I love how my eyes make me see, and how my eyes make me, me.</i>

Freedom to Play</P><STRONG><EM>Before anything else, my special thanks...
</EM></STRONG>Thanks to Sip (<lj user=""ianysip"">) who picked me up from AC last Friday and brought me to Ateneo. You're always perfect timing, meng. <EM>Salamas</EM>. I owe you five billion and beyond. You saved me (and my family) a great logistical challenge. Thank you so very much. I hope your haircut rocks. ^_^

And thanks to Patrick (<lj user=""patricke"">) for the company  dinner and loads of freebies while I was in the Ateneo/Katipunan area. I <EM>also</EM> owe you, five billion and beyond. <font size=1><EM>(Also my biggest thanks to Sabs, for hanging out with us as well at Kenny Rogers, sayang maiksi lang ang ating usapan pero next time ha!!!),</EM></font>

<font size=1><b>Usapang Ian Ysip at Mitzi Alojipan</b>
<u>Ian posts lyrics of this <b>really</b> beautiful song</u> <i>(Malakas ka sakin talaga 'Sip!!! Whoohoo!!!! *ahem*)</i>
<b>Mitzi:</b> Ang ganda, pero bakit parang sawing-sawi ata ang kanta natin?
<b>Ian:</b> You should really get this song.
<b>Mitzi:</b> I really get that song in YOUR context, because <i>somebody</i> probably belongs to you. But I do *not* get this song in MY context, because <u>nobody</u> belongs to me. 
<b>Ian:</b> Uh, no, what I meant was you should <b>download</b> this song.
<b>Mitzi:</b> Ahhhh. That kind of <b>""get.""</b> Ahehe!</font>
O_o
<i>So much for my <b>critical thinking</b> and <b>literary analysis</b>. Overthink!!! Wahahahahaha!</i>


<font size=1><b>Usapang Patrick Echevarria at Mitzi Alojipan</b>
<b>Patrick:</b> By any chance do you know what to do with a 540-piece puzzle? Cause I got it in Europe as some sort of souvenir, but now I don't think I know what to do with it anymore.
<b>Mitzi:</b>  I know!!! You can glue the puzzle pieces together, and frame it and stick it on your wall!
<b>Patrick:</b>You could do that?
<b>Mitzi:</b>  Yup! All you have to do is...
<b>Patrick:</b> No, Mitzi... what I meant was, could you do that? Do you have a place for that? Cause I wanted to give the puzzle to you.
<b>Mitzi:</b>  Ah ganun ba?!!! hehehe. Akala ko, namomoblema ka sa kung saan mo ilalagay ang puzzle.
<b>Patrick:</b> Excited ka kasi masyado!
<b>Mitzi:</b>  Ah hindi... Napa-Patrick na lang talaga ako.</font>

<i>Man, that was so <b>naive!</b> *private joke* Mwahahahahahaha!!!</i>

A very <STRONG><EM>Happy Birthday</EM></STRONG> to my fellow-anemic person: <STRONG>Mac</STRONG>!!!
Thank you for all the jokes, pang-aasar, ATENEO-kinship, great advices and for agreeing to take me to Makati Med (especially when my dad was confined) even at such short notice. Thank you for being a super-duper friend! Above all, thanks for making me feel welcome in AC when I was still new. Happy, happy birthday Mac!!! May you have many more to come! I wish you good health, peace and joy! <EM>Walang</EM> love<EM>, kasi meron ka na nun! So eto na lang:</EM> may you and your sweetheart remain steady and strong. :)

"event","My legs, (especially my right one) were hurting since yesterday afternoon, thanks to my bad cartwheel landing. I pulled a string or probably stretched my muscles in the wrong way. But I wrapped my right leg with a bandage overnight, and kept it on the whole day in school. I must say, this helped a lot. I did not cramp-up or hurt with the soreness I expected. I even walked semi-straight&nbsp;<font size=""1"">(see I wore my 5-minute shoes--quite high from my ordinary shoes&nbsp;that it slowly ""killed"" me, thus my semi-straight walking)</font> today, and to think that I couldn't even walk straight after my bad landing yesterday.&nbsp;<br /><br />I can't believe I made it to 5 rounds around the jogging path. It's been <u><strong>years</strong></u> (think college) since I last ran [as a form of exercise]. I thought I'd only last 3 rounds,... <em>even less actually</em>. But for some reason, I had the energy to go on beyond 3. I'll try to sprint next time.&nbsp;I guess all the dancing, stair-climbing, brisk walking from one end of the faculty room to the other and from GS to HS (and vice versa) has paid off somehow.&nbsp;I am so tired and yet I feel so much more energized. Whoohoo. I love exercising!<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Random story #1"">So Ian <span class=""ljuser""><img style=""VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom"" height=""17"" alt="""" width=""17"" src=""/stc/fck/editor/plugins/livejournal/userinfo.gif"" />ianysip</span>&nbsp;has decided to post Ateneo photos he took, <em>I'm guessing</em> recently. And I can't help but feel&nbsp;jealous.<br />I feel jealous of two things: The first one is how he lives so near Ateneo, and how he could easily drop by, visit and shoot. the second thing I'm jealous of is his ""shooting"" time. Why-oh-why do you have the free time to take photographs, while I don't? <font size=""1"">(Don't answer, as we both know the answer.)</font> Hehe.</div><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Hey shawty, it's yer birthday"">It's Ms. Maud's birthday today. <em>Happy Birthday Miss Mauds!</em> Also Ms. Gcel's, Ms. Irene's and Ms. Beth's. <em>Happy birthday&nbsp;Ms. Gcel, Ms. Irene and Ms. Beth!</em>&nbsp;I would have wanted to post&nbsp; digital birthday cards, but I didn't have the luxury to fiddle with Photoshop and chase these one-in-a-million birthday&nbsp;celebs for a photograph.&nbsp;So, um... belated digital birthday cards perhaps? <br /><br />Would I ever forget another birthday girl?

<b>EDIT:</b>
I <u>terribly</u> miss Ateneo. 
I miss the Gesu. I miss the people I used to hang-around with. I miss Fr. Dacanay. I miss Fr. Bulatao. I miss ANI <font size=1>[JanJan+Uri+Patrick+Cholo+Miko+Sabs+Kiko+Abet+Barwin+Paul+Enzo+Kayelle+etc].</font> I miss the weird yet brilliant beyond brilliant, and sometimes terrorizing profs. I miss GreatBooks, IS134.6 IS151, IS152, and Chinese Med. I miss Manang's. I miss the Cafup. I miss seeing the B-Boys in the Cafup. I miss stalking my crush. I miss swimming in Cervini. I miss the pseudo-runs I did in Moro. I miss the Bellarmine Field. I miss the walks I take to get to class. I miss the misty AdMU air <font size=1>(where you think you're not in the city but you are).</font> I miss the night-classes, and that chilly weather at night. I miss being a full-time student. College was fun! <font size=1>Oh so much fun, it was.</font>

Cases in point, my two most frequently supposed ""boyfriends"" since college, <b>Ian Y.</b> and <b>Patrick E.</b> <i>(both of whom are my ever dearest friends by the way)</i>. 

The present day situation is no different: YES, the list of frequently supposed ""boyfriends"" is still carried on <i>(especially with Ian cause he's whom I'm frequently with/seen with)</i>, and YES, the list is definitely longer <i>(thanks to my ultra-bored students)</i>.

<font size=1>I know people are reading, my counters and tracers reflect this fact, except that most don't wipe their feet.</font> 
It would be real nice if you'd say hello, and answer the two questions I posted here on this 3rd day of September. :)

*+*+*+*+*

Someone recently asked me, <i>""What's one thing you want to do this very moment?""</i>

Without batting an eyelash, I replied: Take a trip away from all this urban chaos; go up the mountains or probably be by the sea <i>(just somewhere a little faraway)</i> with a camera at hand, and be shooting away. <i>My mind dreaming on restlessly, creating poetry with pictures, writing stories with the wind.</i>

I want to lie down on the ground and watch the sky above, and be one with nature all over again.</center>
*sigh*
A girl can dream.

<b>What's that one thing <u>you</u> want to do this very moment?</b>

<b>+_+</b>
Moreover, I was also asked about my biggest physical frustration. 
<i>""What's one thing you want to do well but can't?""</i>
Without batting an eyelash, I replied: ""Dance ballet ala Yuan Yuan Tan <i>(alam ko kataas-taasang pangarap ang maging isang Yuan Yuan Tan,... basta kahit maka pointe shoes lang ako, ok na!!!)</i> and do gymnastics ala Nadia Comaneci. (or *actually* just be able to be agile, strong and flexible enough to do all those flips and tumbles!)""

*sigh* August has been eventful. Yes, very eventful indeed.

Wish Ken, Stoterbaums, Rache, Taskeen and *fine* Josh were here (hehehe.) to complete this pic.</center>

<b>Happy Birthday Mau! For all unexpected and expected things in life... just pray, smile and have fun always! *mwah*</b>
ps: Mau, I don't have so much photographs of your dinner. I only have blurred shots here and there. :( Would you still want them?

That was dinner last Friday night. Seeing old friends after a <u>very</u> long time is always fun. 

<lj-cut text=""So what's new pussycat?"">
One of the highlights of the dinner was when Chattie ""engaged"" <i>(or was it disengaged?) ;p</i> Ian Y. in a logic game called the <b>Penguin Soup</b>. I mean, Ian is already one of the most logical people you could ever meet, and he can crack codes and mathematical problems at warp-speed. But because it was Chattie who played game-master, 'Sip had a splitting head-ache soonafter: Not because of the game itself mind you, but because of Chattie. ;P 

I swear, the girl's gifted to mess with minds. She's so psychotic in the most riot and hilarious kind of way!

'Sip, parang nagmomodel ka dito ah... ng Penguin Soup! ;P
<i>Pwede, pwede!</i></center>

Probably the greatest surprise of them all last Friday was seeing Joshua appear right before our very eyes. He made his word flesh this time around. And he *actually* hung around. 

<b>For Josh:</b> 
Meng, as much as I want to kill you for breaking five hundred million promises of <i>""don't worry I would be there... I wouldn't miss it for the world""</i> promises you make, I have to say that I missed you. Last Friday I had the grandest time picking on you--even if it were only for a few minutes; it felt like college, only that we're all older. And while I'm at a nostalgic roll... 
...well, forget it. I'll just leave this at my grand nostalgia of picking on you and smack my sarcasm on next time and elsewhere.  ^_^
See I'm still nice. :) Counting on that Php10 phone call. You better make me kwento. (so much to tell, I know!) Until next time!

<b>Here's proof that Josh is alive!</b>

The Show-stealer: YESHUA's NOT DEAD!
<font size=1>Dude, I don't know what made you pose this way, but you look like you're picking your nose! ;P</font></center></lj-cut> 

-_-

On other news, my dad's operation was also successful. His skullcap is safely back in place. :) 
Thank you for your continual prayers. 
Although a full recovery is still a thousand miles away, at least we're taking steps toward it each day. 

Now...I'ma get back to work...Lotsa stuff to do!

<b>I will be dancing onstage this Friday.</b> 

My feet hurt. I just learned all the steps today. 
But it was fun! Dance practice again tomorrow!
 
Ian Y., drop by on Friday and take photographs of me!!! 
Hahahaha! ;-)<i>(and well... basta gets mo na yun!)</i>

At times, life can be like a vendo machine. We are faced with an array of choices, and until we decide, drop our change into the slot and press the buttons we ought to press we can never get the product that we want. 

Most often, we know what we want before we have a go at the vending machine, and we get what we want as fast as we probably can.

Ironically, sometimes, it is because of the numerous choices before us that hinder us with deciding on what we really like. Either we choose a product different from what we really wanted in the first place--out of mere curiosity, or we end up instead, shaking our heads, keeping our change and walking away from the vendo machine <u>without</u> a drink in hand.

<b>10 Things About Me</b> 
<i>(a writing exercise I copied from Taskeen)</i>

10. Up until 1999, I grew up in a Japanese-Filipino community, having had the Manila Japanese School more or less a hundred meters away from my house. It was 1999 when the MJS moved to Taguig, so the Japanese community in my area greatly diminished, or rather, disappeared.

9. I used to be so camera shy as an pre-adolescent and teenager, that I barely have pictures of myself during those years. I hated looking at myself in pictures, and I just found it awkward to smile for the camera. I promised myself, at the age of 16, to get over my silly paranoia of cameras. However I overcame this camera-shyness when I was already 19 and in junior year college. A boy who loved to take photographs, took photos of me at a daily and frequent basis--and this was whether I allowed him to or not. I eventually got used to the idea of a camera at such close range to my face ready to capture, anytime. I guess old habits die hard, I still find myself camera shy and reluctant to smile for the camera at times. But thanks to the boy, I am able to stare at the camera without feeling as conscious and paranoid as I used to.

8. In my spare time, I enjoy reading. One of my favorite books is my Oxford Colour English Dictionary. I even highlight the words I find fascinating. My favorite magazines in the world since 1996 are TIME magazine and National Geographic. Yes, I'm nerdy like that. 

7. I am not a born organizer. I absolutely despise organizing gimmicks and dinner outs, but when I am given such responsibility, I usually comply and promise myself never to get in that situation again, but somehow I still get myself in that kind of situation especially when good friends ask. 

6. Most of my bestfriends are guys. I usually hang out with guys more than [I do with] girls. 

5. Back when I was 12, I was chosen from a group of kids, teenagers and adults to be a soloist by Ryan Cayabyab himself to perform on the culminating activity of his summer voice workshop. I sang the screen version of ""Colors of the Wind,"" among other things, at the Abelardo Hall in UP Diliman. 

4. My ID number in Ateneo was 010110. Binary code coolness, I know. Initially, I planned to use 010110 as my new LJ username, but it was already taken. Because I wanted to stick to my ID number, I had to settle with and transcribe the digits into words, and thus <b>ohoneohoneoneoh</b> was created. 010110=oh.one.oh.one.one.oh. Go figure.

3. Upon graduating in college in 2005, I gave myself a year to decide what I really wanted to do in life. I chose to teach. I have no regrets with my decision. However, if I weren't teaching, I'd probably be studying dentistry right now. 

2. Last Friday, I decided to kick a ball to a student some 10-15 meters away from me, which I did. The ball flew and so did my pink Indian shoe! And what was worst, was that my footsock flew off my feet too! Hahahahahahaha!!! ;P Not to mention, this happened while Hardcourt, Volleyball and GS Basketball varsity kids were congregated at the Assumpta Court club time. Hehe. <i>Buti na lang</i> no one laughed!--Obviously, I'm the type of person who can laugh and poke fun at herself. 

1. I don't dance randomly and spontaneously just about anywhere. There has to be purpose when I dance. I only dance and have so much fun dancing when there's choreography involved--This is why I don't enjoy and do clubbing(the party kind). </lj-cut>

<b>O_o</b>
And so the week ends...
At the end of the day, it's really just about the firmness and truth of love governing our souls. And no matter how we are so battered, hurt and betrayed, we are always given the choice to transcend our former selves by re-orienting and re-evaluating our fundamental options. I choose to understand. I choose to forgive. I choose to pray for those people who are blinded by hatred and spite, and continually persecute me.

I don't know how my students took it, but I truly enjoyed the Gandhi and Satyagraha lesson. <i>I am moved with and by your legacy, Mahatma Gandhi.</i> 

More so, I thank the Lord for the opportunity everyday to teach and learn with and from my classes. It's such an honor to be in this vocation of education.

<lj-cut text=""Brain farts on this last night of July, and a speed of green."">
If my brain were a personal computer, and you connected a printer cable to it right now and print, you'd probably print out photographs. I've so much images in my head: Flashbacks of places and things that I've probably haven't thought of for a while now, as well as images that could never go away...

I guess all that I'm trying to say is that the next thing on my list is a digital SLR camera--it's something I've always wanted since I was 16. I don't know how I'll save up for it right now, as there's grad school to pay for among other pertinent and urgent matters, but I know that if there's a will, there's a way. Sure, it's a long way with my salary and all, but you know what? I've learned throughout the years that what you get in life is so much <i>sweeter</i> when you work for it.<br>

<font size=1><b>[edit]</b></font> Although, it is also just as sweet when you get things for *free* every once in a while: I could never deny the grace. And if I think about it, winning the lottery <i>ain't that half-bad</i> either, yo. 
Oh, yes. A girl can dream.

"event","Oh yes. I am still alive.&nbsp;<em><strong>Daijobo desu.<br /></strong></em><br />I've not been updated cause I don't exactly have the luxury and privilege of time especially with teaching. Sometimes the time for yourself is devoted to your students. I'm not complaining, I truly believe that it's really worth&nbsp;everything, but just so you know one of the major reasons why. :-)<br /><br />Today, classes were suspended. So I've a little time up my sleeves.<br /><br /><strong>PatrickSuperStar</strong>, here. I've updated. Had fun catching up with you earlier, after a whole 2 months of being incommunicado with you. You better get a livejournal account, cause this will be a protected journal real soon. <em>(And that goes for you too <strong>Pisy</strong>.)</em>&nbsp;<br />Once the both of you get that account, the real updating can begin.&nbsp;<em>(With pictures pa!)</em>&nbsp;<br /><font size=""1"">My friends:&nbsp;I'm a teacher now, and my students could get snoopy and read my ""writings.""&nbsp;Haha! Iba na ang usapang-teknolohiya! ;-p<br /></font><br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""So the story goes..."">From the start of my employment at AC, everything's been an emotional and physical&nbsp;rollercoaster ride. But for some reason, God makes things work out...<br />Like when my good old college laptop, Dork,&nbsp;broke down and *finally* hit the fan, I thought that was the end of portable computing for me, especially with my circumstance.&nbsp;But I was able to get a semi-brand new Dell Laptop just for a thousand pesos--just in time for lesson planning and other paperwork writing before the school year started.<br /><br />When I thought that I would go bonkers living in the hospital (and all that jazz) with trying to finish work before deadlines and at the same time try living a ""normal life"" despite the situation, Pisy or my cousin TR will text and take me out to hang out and somehow my sanity is saved.<br /><br />When I'd feel really sad and alone watching over my dad when he was in the ICU, Mac, Alan, Ms. Lorna, Pat Garcia, Mrs. Martin, Prescy, Boss Benj, the MANGGYAN team, etc... would text all these prayers and jokes that would keep me company in the middle of the night.&nbsp;Oh and the Makati Med nurses were all very warm, assuring&nbsp;and caring as well. :-)<br /><br />When my dad almost died 3 times due to different circumstances, there would always be an angel in the representation of doctors--his friends who would be there at the right place and right time, and would save his life. (And he was saved.)<br /><br />There's so much to reflect on, now that my dad's home and back from his two-month stay in the hospital. There's even so much to be thankful for. Everyday's a miracle, and life's too short to take for granted. Everything is an adjustment this point forward sure, but life&nbsp;will forever be like shoes to adjust with every step of the journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is impossible to face, especially with God and love by your side. I've learned to find beauty and joy in the simplest and smallest of things, and that I've become even more resilient than ever. My father has taught me to be strong ever since, and I guess all the more now.&nbsp;<br /><br />If there is something I appreciate, it would be the fact that I've seen love rise above all the challenges. My mother is amazing, and I pray that one day, should the Lord permit me to marry the right one for me, I will value and live out my marriage just like how my mom lives out her vocation and commitment with my father. After everything, she is ever more devoted as his wife, and has realized that despite his illness, she loves him even more. <em>""For better or for worse... in sickness and in health... for richer or for poorer.""&nbsp; </em>I feel that my parents truly epitomize the sacrament of marriage, and I guess it's such a blessing and beauty to witness and be a part of such reality in this day and age. And I can't help but love, admire and respect my mother all the more for her dedication and love.&nbsp;She is truly something. I love her so.<br /><br />My aunt, my mom's sister, sister-in-law of my dad is just as admirable as well. For someone not related or bound by blood she is as ever dedicated and committed in taking care of my father as if she were his real sister. It moves me, how much Tita Zen is such a strong, beautiful&nbsp;and amazing woman.&nbsp;She does this with her whole heart, mind and spirit that she epitomizes God, goodness and miracles through her actions.&nbsp;I love Tita Zen even more now because of how she takes care&nbsp;of my father. <br /><br />I've learned to love without expecting anything in return. This is how I love my father. Not that I never loved my dad like this&nbsp;or realized this before. But the intensity of my love for my father is so much more today than it was yesterday. Just like the song yes, <em>""I love you more today than yesterday, but not as much as tomorrow.""</em>&nbsp;That's how I love him. More and more each day.<br /><br />I don't know if I'm making any sense.&nbsp;I'm not trying to impress anyway; I'm just writing, for the love of writing, and probably to say hello and thanks.<br /><br />I would like to thank all the people who prayed for Tatay and supported our family during our moments of crises. Thank you for coming into our lives: you all left footprints in our hearts. We are never ever the same.</div>

Hear me out, like how I hear you out.<br /><br />Aren't those <u>ROAR</u> moments?!!!<br /><br />So where does sincerity and honesty come in all these contexts you may ask.&nbsp;<br />The answer is, <strong>in everything</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br />If one is sincere enough to get-to-know a person for all he/she is worth, a conversation of full attention is needed. With a full attention, you will not go around in circles, neither will you pretend to know something in order to project that you're ""in-the-know,"" nor prevent another from being his/her <em>updated</em> self.&nbsp;<br /><br />That's why we talk <em>(discuss, argue, converse, debate, fight,&nbsp;compromise and concede)</em> because&nbsp;verbal expression&nbsp;our most personal, humanly and intrinsic&nbsp;means of knowing and finding the other.&nbsp;Thus if we taint ourselves with insincerity and dishonesty in our communication ritual, then what's the point in all our talking?<br /></div>

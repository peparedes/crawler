"event","A short assessment of various anime of which I have watched one or more episodes on Crunchyroll.

Blue Exorcist - Son of Satan decides to become an exorcist. Wacky hijinks ensue. My favorite so far.

Gosick - He's a Japanese exchange student. She's a Goth Loli. They solve mysteries in post-Great War Europe. Recommended.

Gintama - Instead of the Meiji restoration, aliens invaded. Hilarity ensues. Opening sequence definitely recommended.

Space Pirate Captain Harlock - Title says it all really. A classic.

Galaxy Express 999 - No one in this world ever gets what they want, and that is beautiful. Everybody dies frustrated and sad, and that is beautiful. But watch some Harlock first.

Sengoku Otome (a.k.a. Battle Girls) - Perfectly ordinary Japanese school girl is transported back into time to warring states era Japan. Where, for some reason, everybody is female (except the talking dog). Total guilty pleasure.

11 Eyes - Interesting premise that doesn't quite pan out. Bonus points for the Hungarian.

Tono to Issho - Japanese history as it didn't actually happen.

Panty and Stocking (with Garterbelt) - Gainax.

Astarotte's Toy - Ten year old succubus needs a harem.

Hanasaku Iroha - Girls at an inn. Maybe something happened? I don't remember.

Bridge to the Starry Skies - I got bored half way through and stopped watching.

We Without Wings - Did you know black people always speak in rap? Also, rape, ha ha ha!

SKET Dance - The one episode I watched was the sort of farce I hate, but it seemed like the series might have potential.

My Everyday Life - Fake Azumanga.

Let's Play! - Alien cat girls invade Earth for Korean BBQ. Why can't I stop watching?!"

Today I got an email about a showing of ""Hazman Havarod"", a documentary about the gay rights movement in Israel. Forty-five minutes later I got another email telling me to disregard the previous email as it had been sent due to a ""technical error""."

"event","<p>I was negligent about blogging my PAX experience last year. This year, I would like to avoid that, so before going to bed, I give you the highlights of my Friday at PAX 2009:</p>
<ul>
<li>Played the Batman: Arkham Asylum demo. I couldn't even hear the dialogue, and it still convinced me it's time to break down and get an Xbox 360.</li>
<li>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle nostalgia tripping. The TMNT: Smash Up game was actually quite fun, to the extent I might even consider getting it, and I happily wore a TMNT: 25th anniversary pin around the rest of the day. Also, full size Turtle Bus!</li>
<li>I made an impulse buy of a sanely priced, used copy of Dragon Quest VIII, but I'm not sure I'll ever actually get around to playing it.</li>
<li>The following diaglouge during a discussion about cosplaying con-goers:

Dave: And there was someone dressed as an Earthbound character.
Me: Really? I don't remember seeing anything like that.
Dave: Yeah. Some one was dressed as Paula.
Me: Oh. Wow! That was Paula! She seems a lot less creepy now.

I saw her again latter, and she actually still seemed pretty creepy.

<li>Race for the Galaxy is a fun table-top game.</li>
<li>I participated in the attempt to set a world-record for most DSs played simultaneously in a single gathering. I made sure Suikoden got representation.</li>
<li>I was sad to discover that Toho Studio lawyers finally set their guns on Seattle gaming fixture Pink Godzilla Games.</li>
<li>Mario Kart 64 is still the best of the Mario Kart games.</li>
<li>Skipped the Anamanaguchi concert as I wasn't very impressed with them last year. I was drafted into a game of Settlers outside the concert hall, and from what I could hear, they sounded better from the outside then they did from the inside.</li>
<li>Metroid Metal rocked. I would have personally preferred something less metal, and more prog, but they gave a great high energy performance. I was actually disappointed in the crowd. If I hadn't been carrying a giant swag bag at the time, I would have probably moved forward where the crowd was getting more into the music. In any case, I couldn't stand still. I plan to pick up their album tomorrow if I can. The line tonight was too long, and it was already very late.</li>
</ul>"

"event","Via the application of cold logic and demonstrate that I am probably a horrible person.

First a preamble: The following thoughts were occasioned by the recent Israeli incursion into Gaza. I think this action is plainly unjustified and immoral due to the fact that the Israelis are lashing out and endangering innocent lives without any clear goals. They have clearly fallen into the ""We have to do something! This is something! We have to do this!"" trap. That being said, the following occurs to me:

Gaza is essentially an anarchic region without any rule of law, whatever nominal authority Hamas might posses. In such areas occupation is always futile since an effective occupation involves seizing the reigns of power, and in places like Gaza, no reigns of power exist to be seized.

The only effective means to conduct relations with a lawless region are to ignore it, isolate yourself from it, or conquer it. Ignoring rockets being launched into your territory is an obvious non-starter. I'm not convinced Israel has adequately attempted to isolate itself from Gaza, but assuming for a moment that it had, this would leave systematic conquest (as opposed to taking pot shots at anyone who pisses you off) as the only option and effectively make it a form of self-defense.

If the idea of conquest as self-defense does not seem bizarre enough, consider that anyone who resisted a conquest-in-self-defense would be resisting a <i>legitimate</i> authority and thus, <i>ipso facto</i>, not innocent. None of which is to say that any and all possible actions by the conquerors would be licit in such circumstances.

Please keep in mind that I'm more interested in arguing about the merits of the abstract conclusion than whether the specific situation actually fits it."

Take for example Genesis 37:5, 

vay-yachalom yoseif chalom vay-yaggeid l'echayv vay-yosifu 'od s'no otho.

A literal translation of which is ""And dreamed Joseph a dream and he told to his brothers and they josephed more hatred of him"". 

It's not like I shouldn't have seen this coming, however. Joseph was in introduced in Genesis 30:24 with the line 

vat-tiqrah eth-sh'mo yoseif leimor yoseif HASHEM li bein acheir. 

And she called his name Joseph, to say ""Joseph the Lord for me another son""."

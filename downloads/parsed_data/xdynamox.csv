"event","shit, so i just wrote an entry and deleted on accident. ill try it again though.

i had too much fun.&nbsp; i loved every single second of the smokey mountains.
and when i was in virgina visiting my family, i felt like i belonged there or something. even though its a smalll ass town. i just love the mountains and nature.
ive realized im a very outdoory kind of person. i think ive always known it, but after this trip, i plan on living it. i love adventure,&nbsp;trying&nbsp;new things,&nbsp;and meeting new people. i cant wait to get out of here. but i know ill miss all my friends a lot :(
white water rafting was by far my favorite. it was such a blast. i plan on going on class 5s. (a class six rapid would be like niagra falls)(a class six rapid becomes a class 5 when someone survives it.)
we were just on class three and four rapids.
and my tour guid, matt, was AMAZING.
i fell deeply infatuated with him.
he was like all about some soccer. and he was really flirtatious with me! i dont understand why though ...&nbsp;
what evvv.
but i hate how the first guy that comes around and likes me, or just guys that are hot in general i jump at. ITS LORAIN COUNTIES FAULT.
lasfjjkasdhfkjd i liked him so much. he's kinda the one that made me realize i need to persue my dreams of adventure and shit even though i love the city life. i mean shopping is like so much fun. i could never give that up. but for a summer job, going to tennessee and being a white water raft guide sleeping in a tent sounds really appealing.
askdfjaskldfj&nbsp;WHY do i have to be so youngggggggg.i feel like the only guys i&nbsp;like are olderish in college,&nbsp;even though i only really like one, but they are just so much more matureish and they like know what they want, thats very attractive to me. add goofyness to that.&nbsp;

non of that really made sense or came out that way i wanted to, but i guess you get the over all point?"

which could be a while
but that gives me time to buy an outfit to match them!
i love shopping. i really do.

"event","i just slepttt soooooo much. 
i got home last night really late, and didnt go to sleep till really late. but my mom still made me go to school. and i had all this stuff planned out today that i had to do. and i have homework, sorta, but im not actually going to do it. im going right up to my bed after i write this and going to sleep.

florida was so much fun. i realized a lot of stuff down thhere. we stayed on this island and it was the bomb. i gained back all the weight i lost, which kinda sucks, but whatever. i tried so many new things. like osterige(sp?) and parasailing. the guys there were in their 20s mostly, so i didnt get a chance to hook up with anyone :/ i mean i talked to people but i didnt like chill with anyone. next time i go on a trip, im bringing a friend becuase then i can socialize way easier. i spent a lot of the time by myself. which is fine. i joged two miles each day on the beach! and i would eat icecream and read books. kinda lame but whatever. it feels like so much happened down there, i just cant remember any of it. i want to go back sososososo bad. 

i have more important things to write about. but im so tired. so im going to go to sleep. im going to write them down somewhere else and get back to it."

1. What do YOU think of the way you look? i hate to sound gay but i really do hate the way i look.
2. What do YOU think about your attitude? i can be very  pessimistic at times which is a horrible trait. and once i start getting depressed im not very fun to be around. i get jealous too easily. so overall i dont really like my attitude. but that can be easily fixed?

"event","i feel like i should update everyone on whats going on.
but thats a lot of updating. i guess ill state the important stuff.

i just got home yesturday from being gone for 11 days. and i loved being gone. i want to leave oberlin so bad. i want to live in virginia. or somewhere not in ohio. ohio is lame. 
im leaving for new york city in a few days. i have a niece. her name is savannah rae. i officially cant stand looking in the mear or looking at pictures of myself. i dont like the fact that i hate the way i look so much but i cant help it. ive smoked weed before, once. i miss cutting. but i wont start again. thats a promise. i need some new people to hang out with. i like everyone i just dont think i fit in with them. im not happy when im around them. ( this is pretty much everyone except cheryl, mia, hannah, jackie, and eliza )  i dont have a best friend. and i really want one. i think my cousin who i thought was cool might actually be kinda weird.
i have one secret im afraid to tell anyone. im even afraid to admit it to myself. i feel dirty all the time. i feel like everytime i hear someone likes me there must be something wrong with that person becuase how could i be liked.
i really wish people didnt care about labels or if they are ""cool"" enough and i expecially wish people wouldnt think that they know what everyone is thinking.
these lyrics kinda explain it

Oh, but everybody thinks
That everybody knows
About everybody else
Nobody knows anything about themselves
'Cause they're all worried about everybody else


and i myself are one of those people who cared about labels (i love labels and stuff i just hate it when people judge other people by how much money they have or if this label is out, ect. i dont mind labels themselves, if that made sence) and cared about coolness and thought i knew what everyone was thinking. but ive decided to try to stop. 
i need to stop complaining and actually get a life. im sure no one likes to read these kind of entrys. i really just need to get over myself and start being happy. but i forgot how.
this entry sounds really really really lame. like beyond lame."

"event","recovered alcoholics and their kids are the shit.
i love AA its incredible. everyone is the bomb. 

so im living life to the fullest. ive stoped worrying about everything. i dont care anymore. this weekend was the best. ever. so my parents are both in AA, so we go to this camp every year in new london where just a bunch of everyone get together. and last year was my first year. and i met these two girls last year, stacey and beth. i never saw them until this weekend and it made me realize how fun they were. so we are getting together on weekends and thursday and AA meetings! haha. anyways so i saw them and like from the minute they saw me they just made me feel comfertable. like they werent weird around me. so its friday and we go watch beths bruther play basketball with some other people. his name is gary. and hes cute. i have a crush on him. and he was cool to. like he just came up and huged me and was like hannah! and he was all sweaty. ew. i told him that to. so i made him take a shower. and then we huged some more. haha. hes one of those guys that likes to touch everyone. i like cuddling by the way. its my new favorite thing. so whatever happened friday night was kinda  blur. so ill move on. saturday afternoon is when stuff started to happen. 

okay ill get back to that in a second. so i realized when im around people i like or when im put on the spot, or when i nowww someones directly flirting to me i actually get tense and i cant think straight or im afraid ill say something completely dumb so i dont talk. like at first i wasnt talking at all. im not kidding. i just didnt talk. and gary would like flirt with me and i have no comebacks so i just smiled and looked like a fucking retard. i wish i was clever. god i wish i could just come up with something that sounds funny or smart. but i never can. 

so anyways saturday afternoon. so this one weird kid had a MAJOR crush on beth. so we were trying to hook him up with her ( this was before we knew he was weird ) so like me, stacey, beth, scott (the weird kid), and danyell all go for a walk. (its dark out) so his idle is eminem, he thinks he can rape, apperently hes fucked more than 150 girls, he was once engaged to a 14 year old (hes 18 1/2 ) and we were like asking him "" dont you think thats weird and he was like "" age aint nothing but a number "" omg it was actually funny. i guess you just had to be there. and so then he sang to beth and he called it his own but it was acutally like some random old R&B song. and one of the parts he was like "" and i cant wait to kiss your lucious lips just like brother to mother "" and then beth was like "" thats fucking INSEST ""
yeah so then scott was getting kinda broing as our interetainment so we went to the basketball courts and alll hung out and watch some people play basketball. while we were doing this the cops were like circling aorund the camp sight using a SEARCH light looking for someone. and we were like what the fuck its not like we are selling drugs. so the cops like come over and i guess one of the guys they were looking for was on the court playing basketball. we had no idea who this kid was. so like the cops make him sit down and remove everything from his pockets and he has weed so they handcuffed him and this was all happening like 10 feet in front of us. so the cops are like asking us questions. and stupid ass beth was trying to be funny and like started acting like and actual slut. so me and stacey were like beth shut the fuck up. the cops liked me and stacey but they thought beth was weird. so my parents heard about the cops looking for people so they came and got me as the cops were leaving the seen. they thought i had something to do with it. my parents actually think im going to smoke shit. okay ive already had the chance about a thousand times to smoke weed, im probably not going to. drink maybe.

so after that everyone came back to the camp site and fucking loser scott starts like stalking beth. and gary (beths brother) is actually getting pissed at the guy. and so then anthony ( staceys older sister boyfriend whos actually HOTT, whos also from the east side of cleveland bitches! ) so anthonys like "" lets see what you got punk "" so they actually have a rap battle and it was so fucking funny. like scott could not rap worth shit. he said stuff like "" while you're in class im fucking your girl in the Back "" and "" yo im like mighty mouse and img onna come kill you in your house "" 
god it was funny. 

so theres this other guy aaron there. and im going to marry someone exqctly like him. the last night his girlfriend wasnt there. and he was really cool. ( hes around 22ish probably ) . and hes like funny but only when he needs to be and he smart but not nerdy. and hes like myserious but only if you want him to be. and hes the best looking man ever. im not kidding. i say a lot of people are good looking. but hes like down to earth hottie. this morning before i left he took off his tshirt like near his tent to change. and i looked at stacey and was like "" instant replay! "" and i guess he heard me. haha. but i guess he thought it was funny.

and i love campfires with funny people. it was one of those ones that was too dark to really tell if the person was looking at you or not. and i like those kinda. 

melissa was due yesturday. if she doesn have savannah by thursday they are inducing her. i really really really hopes she has it tonight so that i can be there. becuase if not im not going to be able to see the baby when its born. which is something ive been really looking forward to. tomorrow i leave for camp and i wont be home till july 4th so if not tonight i wont be able to see the babies first few hours.....

 blahh i kinda dont want to go to camp. but whateverrr. im going to be really outgoing and be like that one girl that everyone wants to know and everyone likes and no ones mean to. haha not like thats going to happen. the thing is around stacey and beth i could be really like dumb or tell them anything and they wouldnt think im like a slut or did anything wrong. not that i am. but they just wouldnt give me a bad name. and when your camping no one actually give a shit what you look like or if your dirty or what you're wearing. its just nice to be around people that dont care. ( sorry im not spelling anything right in this entry but i dont feel like spell checking everything )  and ive always been really self consiose of my body and they made me feel like nothing mattered at all. like other people notice everything. and they care to much. like when im around certain people i feel like i have to try to be skinny. or look like something to be seen with them. 

anyways my mom is kicking me off to make me go pack so maybe ill update later. most likely not becuase fred will be on probably. 
oh yeah.
freds home for like three weeks.
yay."

I went to get my physical the other day. and there were so many cute boys! they need to get their fineee asses into oberlin school district.<BR>im dumb.<BR>and i cried watching diry dancing. I cry every fucking time i see that movie. im in love with it. Ive seen it soooo many times too. And im not one of those people that can watch movies over and over again. If ive seen it once, thats good enough. Only good movies i will watch twice.</P>
<P><BR>i hate my family right now. Everyone left the house around 9AM this morning and didnt get home till like 430ish. So i cleaned 3 rooms. vacuumed, dusted, the whole shaBam. so i was kinda excited for them to get home to see that i actually did something today. And my mom gets home and tells me everything i did WRONG. she didnt even give a thanks or anything. I was so pissed off. And then my dad gets home and cole and my mom tell my dad how all i do all day is sit on my ass or sleep. HOW THE FUCK WOULD THEY KNOW WHAT IVE DONE THROUGHOUT THE DAY. they werent even home. EVEN THOUGH I ACUTALLY CLEANED. which i NEVER do. sorry im not a early bird and can wake up at 830 in the fucking morning every day. I LIKE waking up at 1130/ 12ish and starting my day. So then my brother goes on about how fat i am. Becuase his goal when hes around me is to make me cry. which i did. he won. fuck him. <BR>and my mom is PMSing like CRAZY. so of course if i do ANNYTHING wrong or even if i do something right ( like cleaning the house ) she grounds me. i needed to vent. sorry.</P>
<P><BR>im not livejournaling that much anymore. ill start. i promise. Ive even had a lot to write about lately. My mom makes me get off at 11 though and thats when all my thoughts are at full power. and she hides the fucking mouse in their room so i cant get it and get on the computer. </P>

i wrote this around 1ish today.


Soooo yesturdays drum lessons went well actually. i did pretty good. :)
anddd then i went to go get my camera and its the bombbbb. i have a crush on it. and today i took picturess. so that was funn. im really gonna miss everyone a lot. kevin squire just gave me an online hug :) haha i love being corny. anyways so school got out at 930! whatwhat. so me and a few people walked down to convinet (sp?) andd then my mom picked me up and i went to the hospital to see melissa and her big belly :)

okay yesturday iwent to hot topic to get some earing and a new belt. and i was wearing my against me! tshirt. so the guy that works there was CUTE and i have a huge crush on him. so i was getting my stuff and we started to talk about against me! and he was like yeah later on this year i think they are coming to ohio to play another show. And he was like yeah you should go :):)
i know its really PATHETIC that i go all asdjflksdfa over this. but he was sooo cute. i hope next time i go to hot topic he'll talk to me again! alright. im sounding wayyyy to dumb. 
i wish i was clever. I say the dumbest things. and im not kidding either. I wish i could like come up with this cool thing to say that would be all slick. but instead i say things like ... You Bet! .... 


when i was getting my camera the guy who was helping me thought i was 16/17

hell yes.

now its just time to lose some of these love handles/jelly rolllsss..
but im not even gonna worry about it anymore. whats the point. why should i give a fuck what someone thinks of me ? and if they think im to big. fuck them. they arent worth it.

exactly.

now lets just hope i can hold this attitude.

p.s. sorry my spelling sucks. i really need practice spelling over the summer ....

oh yeah! i forgot again! i dont know if i ever LJed about this, but i won 3rd place at the Open Door Christian School art fair! anddd today my english teacher came up to me and commeted on this drawing i did on the holocaust and said i should really think about art school, becuase im a very talented person :)

YES. im having such a good week :)
AND ITS FUCKING SUMMMERRRR!!!!!!!!"

"event","this post was supposed to be yesturday. so act like its wednesday.

okkay. where to start.
today was a really good day. I wanted to LJ yesturday but i called my mom a bitch ...
whoopppss ... and she heard me. So i got grounded. Im still grounded but shes not here
right now. I had my reasons to. but i really dont feel like talking about that.
ANYways i talk about last night first. I was watching Blow Out on Bravo ( i lovelovelove
that show ) if you dont know its about this hair dresser named Jonathan (gorgeous) and
hes the best. so yeah i was watching it and he was talking about how he just loves what he
does and he wouldnt change it for anything. And then he was like making this prodect of
hair stuff and he didnt want it to be shit. he didnt care about the money, and he could tell
he wasnt lying. He was very passionate. I really like that. He was also talking about how
when he makes hair look beatiful it makes him kinda want to cry. Yeah that sounds really
dumb but i was just thinking about how when i get older i really just want to be the best at
whatever i do. Im not sure what i want to do yet, all i know is that im going to do
whatever it takes to be the top. I really hope i get into some good college and i dont want
to be just another person who goes to college and then gets a husband has 3 kids gets a
nice house. goes to church every sunday, so on and so on. I just hope i become really
passionate.

another thing ive been really thinking lately are my choices. I want to go to oberlin. But i
want to stay at open door. Yes i will be going back to oberlin next year, im just not sure. I
really like everyone at open door a lot. I could totally see myself graduating with them.
And like going to cedar point and all that shit highschoolers do. I mean i see myself at
oberlin to i really just dont see having as much fun. There are a few people i like . Im
kinda afraid. Becuase 7th grade year i was actually Depressed like woah. I thought about
suicide. i didnt really care if the next day i would have died. I dont think ive ever told
anyone that. I know i would NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER do that now NOTE: THIS
WAS LAST YEAR. not this year. This year im not sad. but im not happy. Im just hannah.
sorry this all sounds gay. but whatever. would if oberlin really isnt all that great. maybe ill
go my freshman year at oberlin and then if it really sucks i will go back to open door. 

yeah so today our class went to swings and things for the day ( well till 12 ) and we rode
go carts, it was the bomb, i was totally passing up everyone :) becuase racing is in my
blood. ha. i loveee go carts <3 . and then me and tori and emily beiri ( i used to not like
emily but shes cool now ) and chris westage <3 went on these bumber boat things. and we
got soakkkeeedd. so at the end since we were all already wet we just jumped into the
water :) it was so much fun. And thennnn on the way home i sat by kevin U. on the buss.
cuteee. this might sound realllyyy superr weirdd. but hes just one of those guys that you
could flirt with forever but never want to go out with. We were actually on top of
eachother the whole way home. 

im really tired.

so today i have drum lesssonnnsss and i really dont want to go because i dont practice and i can tell mr jones gets kinda pissed because i suck. 
And im also going to the mall to buy my digital camera today :):):):) so that i can take pictures of everyone and you all will have an idea of open door ... even though only like 5? people read this thing. haha. thats really pathetic."

"event","mmm im really excited for this summer. last summer was okay. i have a feeling this one
is going to be better. this summer i plan to hang out everywhere but my house. i guess i
could try riding my bike into town or something. but thats a ways away and a really busy
road. but this summer im going to get off my ass and do stuff. and im not going to think
to much about life. because i kinda get depressed when i do that. and i hate being
depressed.
maybe ill do a end of the school year post where i write all about the stuff that i learned
this year, and all the new kinds of people i discovered. yeah that sounds good. not right now though. im not in the computer mood.
but ill update anyways becuase mias craving an update :)

so today was this ""blow out"" party at our school for just our grade. and i thought it was going to be really lame. but it was actually a blast. there were only like 2 shaperones and they didnt even watch us. but like everyone was being super nice and everyone was happy :) i love being places where everyones happy. me and justin isaminger switched tshirts. i was wearing his Langston Wrestling CHAMPION tshirt. it was pretty hott. and he was wearing my bayside bobcats tshirt, it was really tight on him. heh. 
and then i was playing football with kevin squire, hes kinda cute, and we have this joke that hes my body gaurd ... anyways long story. and like kevin S. is the bomb. And mostly i was hanging out with Kevin Urbansky. Hes really fun to be around. and hes hottttttt. i used to think he wasnt, but he totally grew on me tonight <3 and he said he cant wait to hang out with me over the summer :) . im really excited for that. and all the girls were being really nice to me, kinda unusual. but it was cool. im kinda gonna miss everyone from open door. it was a lot of fun. 

anyways ill finish this another time. i just got a call from my friends. sleepover tonight. :)
and im canoeing tomorrow!!!!!! i love canoeing :)
:) :) :) :)

"event","yesturday was pretty good.
this week has been crazy.
well not really. but im just going to say it has.
anyways i think im going to the mall soon becuase victoria secret is having their sale thing. and im kinda hoping for a new skirt. eight grade graduation is coming up. im excited becuase im gonna get my parents to buy me a new outfit, shoes and all :-) . gosh i kinda realized how thankful i am. and my parents dont spoil me, im thankful for that to. even though we are considered a wealthy family i still have to work for everything i want and stuff. and like over the summer im going to all these camps and new york city! and im just thankful that we dont have to worry about money at all. 
so this weekend Freds home from his army place. and yesturday we all went out to dinner. it was nice. fred, melissa, grandpa, mom, dad, cole, and me. and fred was being nice. he got aviator sunglasses, haha. he said he would try to make it to a soccer game i have sunday ... even though i doubt he will. i really hope he does though becuase fred never goes to my games. it would mean a lot if he did. but hes going to the indians game that day so i highly doubt he will :-\ . 
lately ive been feeling really like ehck about everything. like we i go places i always feel like im to ugly to be trying on clothes ( that might sound really weird ) or like i feel like i shouldnt wear nice clothes becuase im not good enough. ( i just read that over and it sounds really stupid ).

one thing ive been thinking about a lot is how i only have eight more days of open door schools. this was a really good experience for me. i think i would have liked this year better than if i would have went to oberlin. like if i went to oberlin it would have sucked more than open door. just becuase oberlin middle school actually sucks a lot.  im really excited for highschool to. and getting to know more people. becuase ive realized i talk to very few people. i know people i just dont really talk to them. 
and im super excited for keris party!! :) which is going to be the bomb. and all the other summer parties. :) . im just like at that stage where i really want to meet a lot of new people. not really meet but just talk to. more reasons to get out of the house. 
but the bad thing is my parents are strict like woah. they just are like crazy about who im hanging out with and if im going to be drinking ect .... becuase my mom started drinking when she was 13 and she so stuck on me not ever picking up a drink ... 

yeah so friday night i hung out with mia and jackie and mary and it was nice. we went into town to get some icecream around 9. and i saw ashleyyy and shes the bomb so that was cool. and we saw a bunch of other hott people. and some guys even were checking us out! the thing is i was wearing like a way oversized tshirt on and crappy jeans and like no makeup almost, in other words i looked like crap. 
and mia showed us all of these hot places like fairy land or something? and it was pretty cool. i really like oberlin .. sometimes i wish there was just more to do. once i start driving im gonna be out like all the time. i cannnnoottt stand being at home ... i think thats the second time i said that.

yeah so i dont really liek the computer much anymore. so maybe ill write more later or something.
but im about to hit up the mall."

"event","this weekend is so pointless.
tomorrow is melissas baby shower that we are holding at my house and i can tell already im not really going to enjoy it.
first of all my family doesnt really get along together at all. so there's going to be all this tension. i hope no ones gets into a fight ...
i remember when i was little i used to cry myself to sleep every night. my brother/dad/mom used to fight all the time ... and it got soo bad when they were drinking.
i hope fred doesnt drink when hes raising Savannah Rae ( that's what they are naming her)
and my cousin felicia is coming ... shes really nice and all shes just one of those girls who thinks their better than everyone ... i hate that.

i hated school today.
all the girls officially hate me. when our class went to michigan wedsenday, i hung out mostly with the boys just becuase they dont care and they arent mean. they dont like judge every move i make. so i guess some of the girls thought i wwas just trying to get their boys. bullshit. there isnt one guy in my grade i like. i just cant stand to be around girls for a whole day.
and so thursday and today i could telll everyone was talking about me when i went into the room.
and today in history we were watching this movie and i was using two chairs, one to sit on, one to put my feet up. so someone wanted a chair, but they ended up sitting on the floor or something and this one girl was like "" yeah hannahs so fat she needs two chairs"" 
FUCK YOU. i was so close to punching her.
but all the guys got mad at her for saying that. it was cute how everyone was sticking up for me. 
me and kendra arent really talking that much anymore. shes blaming me for everything since im leaving. she didnt even say anything when ali said that about me. ugh, great friend.

i was in such a crying mood today. i almost seriously started crying like 4 times in school. in gym everyones always yelling at me (gym is all girls) becuase i dont try hard enough ... no one trys in gym, but someone i get blamed. 
and my parents are just being gay. My mom purposely trys to annoying me and make me get mad. she even attmeted to it today. it makes me so angry. and shes always telling me about what i should have done, or what i didnt do. i can never be good enough. 

i always fucked up in soccer today. even when i did try i was horrible. no joke.
i havent played the drums in more than a week. that makes me feel worse becuase when i go to lessons i suck and i feel like im wasting mr. jones time.

okay well im getting yelled at becuase its past my computer time.

by the way. i hate yelling.
and being overweight.

ill take up tomorrow and write something good."

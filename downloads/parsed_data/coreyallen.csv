But with blood I knew in high-school, more than twenty years ago, that there were widely available alternatives that were routinely ignored because of the huge blood business and its marketing clout.&nbsp;<br /><br />The shortages are driving doctor's to alternatives, and that is reducing shortages. Simple economics.&nbsp;Since I'd rather hurry along the long-term solution and don't need the short-term gratification of ""doing something charitable"" through the Red Ripoff, I don't donate blood. </p>"

"event","These are the same question, mathematically. If you can solve one you can solve the other. It just <strong>looks</strong> more complicated. <br /><br />The only thing in the Chinese version that is different is the proof.&nbsp;<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23393742-details/One+of+these+is+a+test+sat+by+Chinese+students.++The+other+is+the+British+version.+(No+prizes+for+guessing+which)/article.do"">http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23393742-details/One+of+these+is+a+test+sat+by+Chinese+students.++The+other+is+the+British+version.+(No+prizes+for+guessing+which)/article.do</a><br /><br />But yeah, you shouldn't be able to stop taking math and still go on to university and expect to be a chemist. It isn't the math itself that matters, it's the critical thinking skills. Math is just a very good avenue to teach this ability to think. Math also makes it easy to measure development in critical thinking skills.&nbsp;It's much harder to test a student's ability to think using writing skills or geography. <br /><br />Kids aren't dropping out of math because ""they're not good at math"". They're dropping out of math because they're not good at <u>thinking</u>. We shouldn't be letting them stop learning to think until they're out of school and out from under our control. All we get by letting students ""prefer"" something that is not math-related is stupid students.&nbsp;<br /><br />Exception: Certain people I know - Conn in particular - can think critically and don't like math. I consider him the exception. If we had other means to demonstrate critical thinking skills other than math, I'd have no complaint. But we don't. So I think we should insist on students taking more math. Sorry Conn."

"event","I found this <a href=""http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/"">blog</a> by economist Greg Mankiw at Harvard and I really like reading it.<br /><br />He posted a <a href=""http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/03/barstool-tax-policy.html"">parable</a> about taxes today that I have seen before and that really reasonates with me.&nbsp;<br /><br />Essentially it's about the wrong-headedness of people's attitudes about the rich and the poor and the question of who pays taxes and who should get tax breaks when tax rates are reduced.&nbsp;The moral of the story is that the rich guy decides to leave and his tax money disappears. <br /><br />I posted a comment a few minutes ago.&nbsp;<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Here is the text of my comment...""><dt class=""comment-poster"" id=""c3763666146745681787""><a name=""c3763666146745681787""></a><span class=""anon-comment-author"">Anonymous</span> said... </dt><dd class=""comment-body""><p>Another problem with this parable (which I have seen before in difference forms) is that it doesn't distinguish between the wealthy and those who are just high-earners. <br /><br />My wife and I are not wealthy. When we married 5.5 years ago we had a net worth of zero. She finished school and got a new job, and one year we realized we were in the top 5% of tax filers according to the IRS. It seemed unbelievable. Our net worth has reached 6 figures this year and we are concentrating on continuing that trend. I went back to school to pursue a PhD in Physics because I am not satisfied and want to accomplish more. <br /><br />The question is: Regardless of the ""wealthy"" who ""all inherited it"" we have to consider whether we can continue to make this kind of forward progress here in the USA. If taxes are increased at our expense and the benefits are minimal or if - even worse - the economic climate actually deteriorates in this country... we will have to leave. We currently pay more in taxes than three of my close friends combined earn in a year. Where will they get their public services if my wife and I leave? We have little wealth to take with us, we have only our technical skill, experience, and productivity. <br /><br />If boomers insist on increasing taxes to fund retirements they should've funded themselves like we are, if the poor continue to increase in number and demand a larger share of our earnings when we were both once poor just like them, if the government continues to squander tax money inefficiently and grow in size to no benefit to us, then we will act rationally and leave. <br /><br />The parable, for wage earners moreso than for the ""already rich"" is very valid. Take it from a couple of highly educated young people who are not rich but are determined to work hard and become rich: We will leave and pay taxes to a country that provides us with value for our money. There are other countries that are being considerably more rational about many things these days than the US. There is no guarantee that this country will automatically win the economy game and be the richest and best forever, certainly not the way it's been going lately.</p></dd></div>"

Television shows make money through advertising and they have to have closed captioning by law. <br /><br />I used to just shrug off the inaccessibility of this new media.&nbsp;It wasn't very prevalent and&nbsp;I considered much of it&nbsp;to be&nbsp;amateur trash (like most of YouTube is but I assume Bill's is not). Unfortunately as more of the things I care&nbsp;about go to this format and as less is done as prose I'm being left behind and it's upsetting. I am a big gamer fan, and all the entertainment action in that genre is in podcasts. I'm a fan of Battlestar Galactica and all their ""extra content"" online has no captioning. Even the snippets they show after the show are uncaptioned.&nbsp;I know everyone in television is only captioning because the federal government forced them to. I guess I thought my generation was less likely to be so ignorant and uncaring, but apparently not. So instead of waiting to see what happens I'm getting angry instead. <br /><br />I'm trying to balance my frustration with the cognizance that regulation will interfere with this kind of new, free, expression. I know a podcast is pretty easy to do. Turn on the mike, talk, upload, done. Some people are editing, some are working harder at it, some are even working from scripts. Somewhere in that progression from rank amateur to commercial media I think the captioning rules should be applied. In particular when people like Scott Kurtz are making a <a href=""http://secure.blindferret.com/PvP/"">living</a> off the new media, I feel I can be a bit more demanding. The only difference between his ""series"" and an old-style TV show is the transmission medium. Everything else is exactly the same, so I feel the rules should apply.&nbsp;<br /><br />If people won't voluntarily make their commercial media accessible to me then I feel justified in forcing them to do so legally. I know this will never happen but I needed to vent. </div>"

I can usually relate but in this particular case I know a bit about why it matters.<br/><br/><div text=""Why it matters..."" class=""ljcut"">First of all, solving this kind of problem in this way provides a deep education to any graduate students associated with the work. If I never did a math problem that wasn't earth-shatteringly-important I'd never do homework.<br/><br/>Secondly, the techniques developed to do this kind of thing usually result in new technologies that DO have wide-ranging practical application. This is the usual argument in favour of things like NASA, btw.<br/><br/>Finally, there are a number of areas of physics and mathematics that are lacking in solutions that resemble this kind of problem. If someone needs to know, really NEEDS to be sure, that something is or is not possible, this result may be applicable and thus important.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Just because ""yr editor"" isn't a mathematician or interested in math doesn't mean he should just mindlessly denigrate people who are working on this kind of thing.

"event","I am a big web comic fan, particularly web comics about games. I came across this <a href=""http://www.pvponline.com/blog/3055/the-death-of-politeness#comment"">post</a> by Kurtz referencing this <a href=""http://www.halfpixel.com/2006/12/28/the-death-of-politeness/ "">post</a> by Kris on the ""death of politeness"".<br /><br />Essentially the claim is that the internet, in particular the anonymity of the internet, has caused us all to become rude nitpickers. Self-professed ""experts"" on everything and anything. The posters long for the ""good old days,"" pre-internet, when you showed someone your work of art and everyone was polite and said ""oh that is very good"" instead of sniping at you behind an anonymous user name.<br /><br />Leaving aside completely my feeling that we are far, far too ""polite"" in person and never provide any meaningful feedback to people for fear of hurting the feelings anyway, I think these two guys have completely missed the point. I didn't feel like this is any less ""polite"" than people are when they're in their anonymous cars driving down the highway. People are just as rude there. That isn't the problem.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""My point of view..."">To me the problem is there are far too many people who really do think they are experts on everything. They really do want to post and to appear as though they know enough to nitpick about something they have just seen or read. We really are in an age where just about everyone that goes to a movie thinks they could've done better than the actual creators of the movie.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am certainly guilty of this. I consume a large number of theatrical plays every year. I am a critic. I will tell Jaime at length the things I think worked and didn't work. I took a theatre class last semester and wrote four critiques of plays that all got 100% grades. Many, many of my fellow students did far worse. Some never even bothered actually going to plays, they lied or faked it. Many of the papers were so poor it was obvious the writers had no comprehension of theatre as art, that they didn't understand any kind of artisitic complexity in any kind of performance at all.<br /><br />But... I feel completely certain that if you went through the online posts on online forums of things each student was individually interested in, such as games, music, MySpace, LJ, etc., etc., and analyzed how many places they posted as though they were qualified to make expert critiques of the subject, you'd find many, if not most, were convinced in their own abilities to do so. They would post as though they were experts, some politely, some rudely, some with horrific grammer or slang or obscenities or whatever, and they'd probably tell you in-person that they ""were really good"" at whatever their personal interest was.<br /><br />Realistically, as evidenced by their inability to observe and write any kind of reasonable critique of a play, the truth is they're actually completely incapable of judging most of what they consume culturally in any way. <br /><br />I think the reason they fool themselves in this way is because it's the only way they can build an internal image of themselves that is not completely embarrassing. They can't go through life with the truth that they are actually not very smart and actually don't know much about anything, actually don't know how to DO anything at all. They work in mindless jobs that are mostly image, or mostly make-work, and they go through school taking place-holder classes and avoiding anything difficult. If they really analyzed what they thought they were experts in, their self-image would crumble. I have taken non-science classes and observed otherwise stupid students who belligerently claim to be experts on many things, more expert than I am on things I have studied at length for years, or have done professionally for years. I'm talking about 18-year-old college freshmen arguing with me about software development, firmly convinced they know more than anyone else in the class on the subject. I have taken science classes and seen the students whose parents have told them how smart they are for 20 years, who can't do simple arithmetic and have no real thinking skills, but are experts in something-or-other (check out my cool&nbsp;iPod&nbsp;mix!) to maintain an image. I've seen them swagger up to their non-science friends and accept the adulation from&nbsp;marginally more-stupid people like they are kings or queens, while carrying a math exam in their backpack with a failing grade on it.<br /><br />The lack of politeness is not new. The swagger of self-professed experts covering up their true stupidity is not new. All the internet has done is provide a new, far easier avenue for this to reach a wider audience.&nbsp;<br /><br />If anything, I think we should be telling more of these people to their faces what we really think of them. Maybe if we told them earlier in their lives how little they knew, or how poorly they were doing, they'd actually go out and work on becoming real experts instead of just building these fantasy images of themselves instead. But... that would be pretty impolite, I guess. Wouldn't want to be impolite to people, oh no. <br /><br /></div>"

If politicians in Michigan think they have the authority to control the lives of their citizens in this way, what else do they think they are allowed to tell us to do? 

I am watching this kind of thing very carefully. Most Americans may have themselves convinced that their country is the best in the world, which is simply not true. Mostly they believe that their political system is perfect and invincible, but this kind of thing proves otherwise. Eventually the US Supreme Court will be stacked sufficiently well that they will cease to protect the citizens from violations of the constitution. Eventually America will be sufficiently un-free that multiple other countries will be safer to live in, and probably will have lower taxes as well. When that happens we're going to have to consider leaving. I stayed here for love. I am financially successful working here and reasonably free. But the trajectory of this country is definitely negative in both regards. The differential between Canada, Britain, Australia and the US in terms of the economy, taxes and freedoms is closing rapidly and it won't be long before the US is clearly much worse. Then it'll be time to move on. 

I have zero confidence that the people of this country can get their act together and clean it up. 

Hopefully PhD will make it easier to go when we need to."

I would be the first person to jump up and shout ""no fair"" when I see discrimination against the deaf and hard-of-hearing. I have a tattoo specifically to remind me to do so every morning when I look in the mirror.

But the deaf community has typically been a complete waste of my time. They claim to speak for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, and yet they are often more hostile and intolerant than the ""enemy"" they are purportedly fighting. 

So, while I want to do something about being able to fly and understand better what is happening at the gate and on board, and while I spend time with my company's disability council and task force, the deaf are busy trying to get rid of a deaf person that isn't ""deaf enough"" to be the president of their college. This woman - born deaf - chose to try to operate in the mainstream instead of barricading herself away from the public. So the deaf students in her school refuse to accept her as president. She's ""deaf-er"" than I am, now that I have an implant. Oh, and in France, the deaf community has parties where deaf kids smash their implants in protest of being forcibly ""integrated"" into the mainstream. 

Gee thanks. Where would I ever be without the help of these heroic deaf groups, eh?

"event","So... I'm drunk on my recent technolust sating.<br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Fanboi drivel..."">Jaime and I wanted a better digital camera for when the baby comes. But I didn't want a basic point-and-shoot, I wanted something better. I also dislike how long a typical digital camera takes to shoot a photo. I also REALLY like macro shots, which means I wanted a camera I could switch lenses on (at least eventually).<br /><br />So this is what we bought. A Nikon <a href=""http://www.nikonusa.com/template.php?cat=1&amp;grp=2&amp;productNr=25216"">D50</a> with the 18-55mm DX <a href=""http://www.nikonusa.com/template.php?cat=1&amp;grp=5&amp;productNr=2158"">lens</a>.&nbsp;We got both as a kit (factory demo) on eBay for just under $600 including shipping. The memory card (1GB SD) was only another $16 at Microcenter. <br /><br />We get some fantastic photos. We've started a kinda-sorta <a href=""http://www.cjhimages.com"">album thingie</a>. The actual website is our own domain. <a href=""http://www.CJHImages.com"">www.CJHImages.com</a>&nbsp;It'll ask for a password. You should all know my last name, but if you don't, it's 'henderson'. <br /><br />The speed of the camera&nbsp;is amazing. You pull the trigger, and just like the old 35mm film SLRs, bam!, you got the shot. It's fantastic.&nbsp;If you're just pulling the trigger haphazardly and trying to get a shot (I've probably shot 750 photos since I got the camera last night) it keeps up no problem. Just bam, bam, bam, shot after shot. SOOO much better than a point-and-shoot. I'm ecstatic about the camera, no exaggeration. <br /><br />Comments on the photos would be appreciated (put them here on LJ). It was my first try. Lots of shots in the dark with the flash turned off.<br /><br />Oh! And if you like Zenfolio, get the referrer number from me so we both save $5 when you buy your first year. I think it's a great site and a great deal.&nbsp;Excuse my sales pitch. *grin*</div>

<p>Yes. ONE.</p>
<p>For since something must needs have been from eternity; as hath been already proved, and is granted on all hands: either there has always existed one unchangeable and <em>independent</em> Being, from which all other beings that are or ever were in the universe, have received their original; or else there has been an infinite succession of changeable and <em>dependent</em> beings, produced one from another in an endless progression, without any original cause at all: which latter supposition is so very absurd, that tho' all atheism must in its account of most things (as shall be shown hereafter) terminate in it, yet I think very few atheists ever were so weak as openly and directly to defend it.</p>"

"event","So I am never on this thing anymore..facebook consumes most of my ""free time"".  YOu know ""free time""- the time that you should be doing homework, working in class or sleeping NOT playing on the internet.

It is good to see that everyone is doing well.  I like LIVEJOURNAL more then facebook I think...maybe. I don't really care to pick favorites, someone always gets hurt.

Update for those who care:
I moved to an upstairs apartment in downtown Tahlequah, a whole three minutes away from school.
I moved in with my boyfriend, whom I am so flippin' happy with.  It is crazy what finds you when you aren't looking.
We got a white cat to go along with Spooky (my black cat)...but guess what...that cat is retarded, no really she is deaf and her eyes are cris-cross, I don't think she can hear at all because she STILL doesn't respond to anything that we call her.  Spooky and her play a lot and Spooky watches over her like she is the baby, so we call the white fuzz ball Baby!
School is ooo so fun I am external affairs chairman for Student Government at NSU, which means I am planing a Haunted HOuse/Halloween Carnival and a Hayride.  I am so freaking busy all of the time.  I am also in OKlahoma INtercollieagate Legislature, which I am speaker of the HOuse of Rep. for NSU.  I started my professional career this semseter at school.

Don't laugh but I work at Arby's too...that was a very humbling moment for me.  Putting on the uniform just made me feel like the dirt of the earth but then I said:  ""Money is Money, Money is Money.""

Well I do apoligize for the spelling and for me never updating!!"

"event","School starts tomorrow and oh boy I am ready to go!  I don't have class untill Tuesday because I am only taking Tuesday/Thursday classes, I am going to try that out and see if it works for me.  ""Lately things just don't seem the same"" The people that I enjoy are around me and we all have fun, but something seems different, I can't hit the nail on the head yet but I will hopefully sometime soon before I kill something.  I've decided to go to Daytona Beach for Spring Break, it is sad that I am already planning for the next long break.  I am taking Noelle because she is funny and awesome and Theresa because I think she would enjoy it.  Oh for those still out in the dark Theresa and I have been living together again since the second week of November and things are going great except when we both drink a little too much and get in stupid fights.  It is like we are married.  

Ever since I came back from Denton, I have been drinking damn near every night.  Now some of you might think this is called being a DRUNK.  But I say I never really drink anyways and this next semester is going to kill me so I won't have time to drink and party I anyone else would be able to do.  Drinking again tonight just because I don't have class tomorrow and my dad and grandma are coming up.  I am excited about all of that.  Well I best get off.  I know things are random and not well organized but I figure it would be a much better read then something boring and something too dragged on."

It sucked really bad but I ofcourse was always the strong one.  It hasn't hit me yet because no one was expecting it.  It just kind of happened and I guess that is how it works.

"event","Okay, well I haven't updated in a long while, so SUE ME!  College is going good.  I never see Theresa anymore, and that is a good thing and a bad thing.  I practically live by myself again which is nice I might add.  I have been super busy.  I work two jobs and go to school for 19 hours and I am in many other activities.  Needless to say I am busy.  I am going to come home next weekend to see Matt, and possible pick someone up on the way down there, that would be nice.  I hate driving to Denton alone, it is so boring after a few trips down and back.  I ride my bike to school like everyday and because of that my legs are strarting to look dead sexy again which is nice.  I am slowly losing weight because I am just going and going the whole time, no real time to eat.  I am doing a thing called OIL Oklahoma Interlegic Legistation, we make up laws and get to go to OKC for five days and debate about them and try to get them to pass.  I am looking forward to being the OUTSTANDING freshmen (this is my first time, thus I am a freshmen)!  Other then trying to keep up with my homework, and rarely hanging out with people I don't have much time to party.  I am okay with that though.  The only person I see on a regular basis is Corey, but that is just because we have classes together and do the homework together or study.  I am thinking about going to OKC or Fayetville for fall break which is in two weeks.  I am not driving home again that is for sure, well for now.  I am so happy that Matt is graduating on Friday!!!  I am so freaking happy for him, I get excited just thinking about it.  I wanted to go but there was no way in HELL that I would be able to attend the ceremony.  Thank God it is starting to cool down, I have my windows open so my next utilities bill should be fairly low, really LOW hopefully!!  I am doing as good as one can do, I guess.  I would love to hang out with people more, but I will have a whole lifetime to fufill that dream, right now I am working on College.  Facebook  consumes my little life, somtimes.  If you aren't on it you SHOULD be.  If anyone ever wants to shoot the weather with me just call me and I would love to talk in what little time that I do have.  Or email me, I respond good to those too.  I do plan on drinkin' friday at my house, just some beer and a beer bong, what a trust friend.  His name is ""Koodoo"" and he never does me wrong.  I made him.  Okay well off to Trumpet lessons and then history class then a meeting so I will be done around 9 something and I am suppose to call someone tonight but I don't remember who...CRAP!"

"event","So Labor Day weekend was good.  Friday started out with a bang, well two painful bangs.  Which I will not mention on LJ.
<h1>Relationship??</h1>I stopped talking to my ""boyfriend"".  I told him ""we couldn't talk anymore because you aren't an ASS!""  I guess I am attracted to guys who are rude/ have ass tendency.  I think it is just the thought of him being mean to everyone else besides me is a good thing to me.  I like to know I am special.  I have everyone's support because the guy told me he loved me!!  Okay a little fast there buddy. So, no relationship for me.  
<h1>School: </h1>I am super stressed with school and everything else that goes on in my little world.  I was going to Rush Kappa Kappa Psi, but I didn't get in because I didn't want to play in the band in Spring, I didn't know it was freaking required.  No lost there.  I went and got Kerry on Sunday, it was awesome.  We came back to Tahlequah, packed and went camping.  We started drinking at six and everyone passed out at 12.  Light weights!!!!  I was awake and asking myself why I wasn't drunk, I did drink alot of straight vodka, and still NOTHING!!  Maybe I need to just drink Tequila that always fucks me up.  I took her home on Monday and we hung around Fayetville.  Then I came home, went to the KKPsi interview, to be later rejected.  Then HAULED ass to Atoka to meet my dad so I could get my cell phone, a new Black Razor Cell Phone.  I didn't get home untill 2:30 AM!  I woke up that morng. because I had to go to work at 10:00.  I work for Dr. Baker in the English dept. I am helping her research for two of her books and she said that the help always gets their name in the book.  So me being the person WHO SUCKS at ENGLISH, gets to be published, yes it is small but my Shannel Adams, and info will be in a back page of two real books.  When I am not at school, I am doing homework, or Band, and if not that then doing more research for Dr. Baker or working for her.  Somehow, I still manage to have fun."

TONIGHT= Theresa, Nicole and Jessica's birthday party at my house.  Oh the anticipation of drunk people at my house.  THis means I have some major cleaning to do today, and my dad is leaving today too.  Had my first football game last night, it was different.  The band still sucks but the people are starting to grow on me.  I got Bonnie's sarcasm now.  I couldn't help but be a smart ass.  Well I will write more when I have more time.  Oh I am substiting at Cookson Head Start, which means I play with 3-5 year olds when I am not at school, I also enjoy napping with them.  I like the little kids, but then again I like everyone, sort of.  Pray that my get together does not get busted or anything stupid.  Maybe even Baker will come back this weekend, he went to U of Arkanas (sp).  I have been beyond busy."

"event","I thought I would say something.  Today (tuesday) I am sick as hell.  Last night I was suppose to go out but I didn't, instead I slept.  I woke up at 6 AM and I was burning up with a fever of 103.9, my joints hurt and I was crying in my sleep, and sweating like a pig.  So after my hour and half shower I went back to bed untill 2ish.  I moved my ass to the living room and started watching Constintine (sp).  That did not last long because I shortly fell asleep again.  A phone woke me up, it was Corey but I thought is was my dad so I started telling him that his car was okay and that I didn't care when he came back and things like that.  After five minutes of me rambling to Corey he asked if I knew who I was talking to.  Ofcourse I know My Dad.  He politely told me I was wrong so I hung up and went back to sleep.  Now four rolls around and there I was laying on the couch.  I knew I should probaly eat something because I hadn't ate for the past two or three days.  I am not starving myself I just haven't been hungery AT ALL!  That sounds weird, I know but nothing sounds good.  Theresa and I were going to go to Chinese food because I love me a bowl of egg drop soup but it didn't open till 5.  So we were driving home and I said ""if only it was Tuesday and not Sunday because I could really go for a Meatball Sub from Subway."" (Meatball is the specail on Tuesdays) After Theresa got done laughing her ass off she informed me that today was Tuesday, so I naturally went to Subway.  I ate maybe two bites and then I couldn't eat anymore.  Again I am not starving myself I am just not hungery at all anymore.  On a positive note I have lost weight like crazy.  It is kind of cool.  Okay, I am tired of typing.  Please excuse any spelling errors because I am not really thinking."

"event","So Tahlequah is getting even better.  I have spent a few days out on a friends boat, lying out and watching all of the boys crash while wakeboarding.  I will try it today or tomorrow.  Life is going good, slow and steady.  I was asked if I wanted to be in a relationship and I replied for the hunderth time, no not now, maybe later.  No one up here really is all that sparking, meaning sparks don't fly when I am around them.  Theresa and Bruce moved up so that means I am even at home less then I was before.  My house is trashed and I just don't think I will be able to stand it for too long.  Getting a job up here soon, I have a few options that are looking really tempting.  My mom called me last night and bitched because I wasn't using enough of my Grandparents money for college then I kindly reminded her that I am not in college at the second.  She stopped.  Well besides wakeboarding and sleeping at the river my life is nothing out of the ordinary."

I still haven't caught up on my sleep yet because Thursday night I was up all day cleaning, then the family came Friday night, and ever since then I have been staying up way too late.  I should really be in bed right now but I had to come up to the school and print out a study guide for one of my two finals on Thursday!  I gave away two kittens, so only two more because I already have a home for the girl.  LIfe seems to be going by too fast.  KC is up here with me, and I think she realized how much I enjoy it up here in slow moving Quah.  Drank too much, sleeps too little, that is the life for me...and KC.

Am I loud and clear, or am I breaking up?
Am I still your charm, or am I just bad luck?
Are we getting closer, or are we just getting more lost? 
I'll show you mine if you show me yours first
Let's compare scars, I'll tell you whose is worse
Let's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words

We live on front porches and swing life away,
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end,
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand

I've been here so long, I think that it's time to move
The winter's so cold, summer's over too soon
Let's pack our bags and settle down where palm trees grow

I've got some friends, some that I hardly know
But we've had some times, I wouldn't trade for the world
We chase these days down with talks of the places that we will go

We live on front porches and swing life away,
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end,
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand....until you hold my hand

I'll show you mine if you show me yours first
Let's compare scars, I'll tell you whose is worse
Let's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words

We live on front porches and swing life away,
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end,

As soon as I was done he asked me and the guy I was beside to step outside when he was done.  Then for five minutes he accused of cheating, I don't really even talk to this guy..I don't even know his name for starters, but NOW I do.  He threatened my again, that he could kick me out of the History department, and he said that we need to ""take our romance out of HIS classroom"". Let me remind all of you again, I DIDN'T KNOW HIS NAME TILL THE MINUTE!!!  So then the guy, Kirk, talk about ""our romance"" and laugh about it.  I can't believe I have to take this easy of a history class, but the AP credit won't count towards my degree just towards my ""electives"".  I have test in Geography tomorrow, I think it might be painful but I will start studing later tonight.  Other then school, I keep my self busy.  I got burnt yesterday I feel asleep for four hours so my back has four hours of sun and my front has maybe 30 minutes, so yes I am a little Two-toned for the minute but I will fix it tomorrow!  


One interesting thing:

Corey and I made a potato gun/bazooka.  It is pretty neat!  It shots out amazing and when you are close enough the wall there is nothing left of the potato.  We also made pipe bombs, and a few other exploding things.  I never thought blowing stuff up could be THIS fun!  We are making Napom (sp) today becuase I want to see how explosive it really is."

Camping in Tahlequah
Camping in Oklahoma 
Going to Colby's
Camping in Denton
Going to the Horse Races
Going to Six Flags
Going to UNT for the Show
Cook-out at my house
Probaly going to Bonnie's 
OR NOTHING!!

"event","So I am going to Colorado this Thursday just to relax and get away and reflect.  I am doing amazing in college, maybe even a 4.0 this semester.  Finals are all next week but thankfully my last one is Wednesday.  

I played in the creek the other day with Zara (the dog), Corey, Adam and Scotty.  Scotty is this guy who says he loves me and he pays for everything mind you I DO NOTHING FOR HIM!!!  I only hang out with him around large groups of people, he thinks we should date while I say HELL NO!  Anyways on with the story.  Zara and I are playing while the boys were looking at something swimming in the water.  When I looked over there was this 5 ft long SNAKE!  I was still and Zara started barking anyways, it was a Cooperhead(sp).  We kept playing and were visted by TWO more cooperheads this is when I realized that we should get out of the water.  Corey caught a garden snake and we put him in a class bottle then broke the bottle and let the snake go.  I haven't done much of anything.  I can't wait to go to Colorado and figure things out.  I will be back in town for Bonnie's concert that following Sunday.  I am bringing my babies to town with me.

I am so happy!  I was there for the first three.  It was weird she started acting all weird and then I put her in a box and she bit me.  Then she gave out a LONg and annoying meow and then came a baby!!  I never thought being a ""grandma"" could be this neat and it hasn't even been 24 hours!  Pictures will follow in the next days."

"event","A lot has happened since the last time I posted.  A friend that I grew up with died a week ago and it has taken me a while to get think about it.  We had that history in a friendship that you will never forget. I only confined in three people about this death and only one really said the right things. 

His death made me realize that I was a horrible person who things just because I wanted the prize at the end, even though the prize was NEVER worth the trouble.  I am becoming that better person one step at a time.  Everything I did in the past is now behind me, I can't believe it took something like this to make me put my foot down.  But things happen for a reason and I believe this is suppose to set me straight.

Because of everything I am thinking about going to Colorado for a few days as soon as school gets out. I really need to relax and up there with my aunt is the perfect place.  I am also thinking about inviting an old friend, I figure I can relax with him because he is so comforting.  Then I will come home to take my mom to Houston and watch Graduation.  I think during that week of finals I will stay in Dallas.  I am going to try and avoid just about everyone.  I don't want drama and I don't need it.  I need to be closer to my family.  I figure I will have July to spend with my few friends back home.  I am taking summer classes in June.  I will lose some more weight because I just can't stand looking bad with a good tan.  We will see what I end up looking like.

I can't wait to have my house back to myself once again, I don't do the whole ""Party at Shannel's EVERYNIGHT!!!""  I need peace and quite.

Spook is about to have babies, that makes me grandma and there will be some pictures only if they are cute."

"event","Easter was GREAT!  I went with someones family and they adopted me once again.  His family was so nice, even the Baptist Church wasn't really that bad.  I even wore a nice clothes for half of the day, while the other half I was in my sweats kicking his cousins ass at football...okay getting my ass handed to me, two of them were All-American. I am signing up for Fall and Summer Classes today. Oh the fun.  One thing that I am enjoying at the moment is not dealing with bullshit. I like not being so attached because some days we talk and some we don't.  I think hard about my future and all it holds for me.  Day by day you deal with speed bumps that you hit and just keep rolling."

"event","So, this weekend.  Friday Theresa came up that was good, she is for sure coming up here.   Then I had CPR class in Muskogee, so Corey and I ventured to the city and say a Cadillac with ALL GOLD!!  He started laughing and then I couldn't help but join him.  After class we went out to his Grandmas and I feel asleep in the hot tub, the guys kept dunking me right before I would fall into a deep sleep.  Then they watched Last Samari, and I feel asleep both Adam and Corey were being jerks, they drew on me and did things of that nature.  The next day I woke up at 8 and then we worked our way to Muskogee for the second and last day of CPR.  I passed.  Now I am certified in CPR, I can save lives.  CPR class was good, it only lasted 6 hours when it was suppose to last 15!  So we called Grandma again and she met us in Muskogee and took us out to eat, then shopped in Muskogee and then we ventured to Tulsa.  Again, we went out to eat at Johnny's...man I love that place.  I went to Garden Ridge for the first time ever...wow I love that place too.  We lost Grandma for almost 2 hours, and we were looking for her all of the time.  Then we went back to Grandmas for another night in the tub, again I feel asleep.  Woke up and Grandma took us out eat AGAIN!  Then I came home and messed around until two and then to a friends birthday party and played Paintball, for the second time ever.  I did really good.  I got a lot of shots but the only one worth mention are the 3 head shots.  I got hit in the face once, finger once, leg once, and  the back of my arm by friendly fire.  I did really good for not wearing any camo or anything like that.  Then I went over to another friends and hung out and helped them study.  We talked for hours, I didn't think I could talk to someone that long that I didn't really know.  Oh yeah, I am also going to do Rookie Bridge Camp, which is the Freshmen camp that everyone goes to, I will be a volunteer, I am pretty excited about that.  So today, I am tired and I have to referee today and the weather sucks up here, then I go to study more at the library.  I may be taking a friend back home with me so he can see his family and go to Six Flags but we will have to see.  I am excited that KC and her friend and Theresa are coming up here for some of Spring Break.  I am going CAVING!  Me in a dark cave, with bats, I don't know if me and the bats are going to be vibing.  Well, on with my day.

The more I talk about it and the more people I tell my seceret to, the better I feel.  I am glad I listened to a friend.

Friends will come and go...I only a handful of friends back home and I know that all of them would never hurt me.  Bonnie, sorry about the call."

DON'T read unless you feel the NEED:

I have been told that I would sleep with anything...if this is true then power to me.  You wish I die of some diease...ME FUCKING TOO!!!  Death seems less painful.  Oh, and the real kicker is...I have A LOT of boyfriends...CORRECTION..I DATE!!!  I don't have a boyfriend, I am dating a couple of guys and the last time I checked that DOESN'T Make me a bad person!!  I am seeing what I want in a serious boyfriend and I haven't touched anyone, besides any of them.  I realized from a past relationship that sex doesn't fix things and that a relationship can't be soly based on SEX!  So no sex for me.  Fuck you.  I am dealing with shit that you don't even know about.  That is right not everyone knows and that includes you!  I just wanted to set the record straight.   I will not discuss my sex life on LJ, because I don't plan on having one.  Trust me you will all know when I will start having sex again, I will make a public statement so that way there is NO doubt in your mind.  I will forget about you, until our paths cross again, until I will stay away, and I expect you to do the same."

Life has treated me good, so has referee...250 in less then 6 hours..that is what I am talking about!  So I hope to pay of my car because I hate being in debt.  My friend got engaged to a guy she barely knows.  This brought up this ackward subject...love.  I told her that I hope she is happy and all but to remember that she is...19!  And they have only known eachother for..three weeks.  I won't get engaged for a long long long long time.  Because engage=marriage=kids=death!  No I believe in love, I found it once and then I lost it...I am good at losing things.  So school is good, job is good and hopefully this week will be good.  I am in no hurry to do anything in life, the only that is promised is death and that too has a price, lets just hope it is cheap.  Because I am cheap.  I told a few people a secret that only they know.  Death is getting closer for people like myself, we are all dying but the real tragedy is we don't know when.  So those people that I told, y'all are great and I know that I have nothing to worry about."

In highschool I was barely able to pull an A out of my ass so now I need to really study.  I am making an A in online German...I can cheat and he knows it too.  I am doing one neat thing...and that is being a Volunteer at Rookie Bridge Camp...Freshmen Orientation Camp.  College is nice.  Valentine's Day is coming up so Corey and I are going to take his Grandma to Olive Garden in Tulsa and I am going to give her one of those HUGE cards.  This is her first Valentine's Day alone.  I also advise everyone to watch the History Channel at 9 on Feb 14 to celebrate the Massacre...That is what I am doing my English Research paper over so I am recording it.

I thought these things were suppose to make me feel good, not tell me the truth!


Not much of anything is going expect school and getting in shape for soccer and marching band...maybe even corp.  If I get this one Grant worth 2000 I am doing it.  I am going to go home sometime.  Spring Break, I am going to go to Daytona Beach like I have been planning since I was like...8!

It snowed today up here, and I didn't have shoes except HEELS!!!  I don't walk well to begin with, and the whole ice and added 3 inches doesn't help AT ALL!!!"

Yes, life goes on.  I played soccer today and enjoyed myself, tomorrow I help a friend move and do more homework and start painting a house.  Oh boy can't wait for that.  I am going to start doing black and white photography again, and I can't wait.  There are a few contest that I am going to enter up here.  I like the death of people, NO LATIN WORD FOR VOLCANO!  Ha..., hell here I come.

Oh and because I don't answer my phone when I am asleep I have someone get upset with me.  Three cheers for me hip hip...!  I still can't eat much of anything which is nice because I lost 5 pounds in a matter of a weekend..Word.  Nothing new in Tahlequah.  Oh supposively I missed this ""totally awesome toga party"", ""there was hot chicks and everything..."".  Darn!  I missed the hot chicks.
Theresa is coming to town next weekend, that means my house has to be spotless.

oh I heard something neat..the band Gorillaz is looking for a new bad mate, supposively you draw a picture of yourself in cartoon figure...I might look into that.  Ya, maybe NOT!"

"event","I am thinking about skipping out of town this weekend.  Even though I could try to find things to do to amuse me, I am thinking about going to the big city and visting some family I haven't seen in a LONG LONG TIME!  I will decide sometime.  If I do I will leave as soon as I get out of class which is 11 AM!  So this leaves time for me to sleep when I get there because they don't get out of work till 4 and 5.  Maybe some family time will be good for Channel.  

Damn it I am still called Channel with an S!  Bastard english teacher last semester That I how I told him to spell my name and now that is the nickname for the class.  For my research project I am going to do the MOB!  I am going to watch Resevior Dogs, Goodfellows, God Father, Road to Predition..If you know any other good movies about the Mob please let me know.  I want to know if I can make Pulp Fiction part of the Mob theroy.

I am taking German again.  In the class I am in, I AM SMART!!  We meet every week and we talk about what we learned, but it is just students and I am the ""ring leader"".  Ha, me good at German!


Other thoughts:

What am I going to do this summer?

Options:
1) Take online classes so I can get 12 hours and get out sooner and so I will still be able to see my family and friends back home.
2) Stay here and get a real job.
3) DCI  Greg keeps calling me and asking.
4) Become lazy and TAN!

Withdraws... 1) MONEY but a grant pays for that   2) Make MONEY     3) Cost MONEY...and I have to try to get money for it by making myself sound pathetic     4) NO MONEY!"

I have to friends that are together we will call them Sally and Bob.  Now I am best friends with Bob because Sally and I grew up together.  Bob loves Sally very much.  Sally cheats on Bob all of the time with random guys.  The sick part is everyone and their mom knows about it and I being both of thier best friends know EVERYTHING on both sides.  Keep in mind I don't want Bob.  I have been a little depressed because it kills me to see Bob love Sally so much and see her treat him like trash, okay worse then trash.  He asked me what was wrong do I told that Sally kissed another guy on New Year's, he asked how I knew, I told the truth ""she told me"".  I didn't tell him about all of the other shit she did last year, oh no.  I told before I left that I didn't want to hear about her and any other guy, and if she did tell me then I was going to tell Bob because he deserves to know.  After I told him he sat there and then decided to go to bed so I stayed and talked to his roomate ""Mandy"".  So we are talking and all of the sudden Sally calls me and yells at me because obviously Bob told Sally.  So next day I see Bob and it is ackward as HELL.  So, I told him that I wouldn't call him or see him untill he wanted to see me.  He informed that I was trying to ruin them and thier relationship.  WTF?  I don't want him.  I knew that I would lose her as a friend for a while because I broke a promise.  I just couldn't do it.  I tell any secrets, I just thought this one was pretty damn important.  So now I am up here with no real friends, no nothing.  Sally is telling everyone stupid stuff that she is making up and Bob doesn't even have the balls to go to the classes that we have together.  Hopefully Mandy and company backs me up, and tells him that I am not lying to break them up.  But knowing my luck no one will say anything to him or her.  They might come around sometime.   There went two best friends at the same time.  

Honestly I feel better now.  Atleast he knows.  And the more I analyze my situation the more I realize that I went through the same thing a year ago.  How did y'all do it?  I don't really think I can lie just to lie anymore.   

Fuck Tahlequah, fuck the ""friends""."

I think that I can finally leave most of Denton behind me, the cloud has been risen and the sun is shinning.  I love home, but I love it even more because I don't live there.  My house here is great, even though Spook climbed my palm tree.  School starts tomorrow and I am excited becuase I might actually know people.  I cross my fingers.  Yes, home was nice, I think I saw everyone...yep I did.  Well Spook will be around for a while so pictures will happen ONE DAY!

Interesting, I must say.  Okay the truth, HATED IT!  I liked the people that were sober. I am not mad at the people I just get upset at their actions.  I was mother hen ALL NIGHT!  Normally I do pretty good with it, but damn, I was mother to too many people.  It ended on a good note: me, theresa, and bonnie had a little bit.  We all got a small buzz, except Theresa because that was the first time she ever drank.  The stuff was too sweet to get drunk.  Watched to Rose Parade the next morn.  Then my grandma, sister, mom and I went to Frisco to go shopping.  We took my mom's way and ended up in The Colony and then Lewsiville, but after 1.5 hours we got there.  I got a neat poster of a mushroom cloud caused from a bomb in black and white.  Today I went shopping some more with my grandma, grandpa, and sister; I enjoyed myself even though I paid for everything that I bought.  I am enjoying myself though.  My big plans for tomorrow is taking my grandparents to Fort Worth so they can leave on the train then go to my other grandparents and vist with them till around 8.  I am going to leave on Tuesday because there is no reason for me to stay in Denton, all of my friends start school tomorrow.

"event","Short little recap:

Got a ring.  Come home and visted my Grandparents in Dallas, and vist everyday with my Grandparents from Daytona Beach.  I get to see my friends, and family and that is the best present I could ask for.  I got a surround sound system for my house along with a DVD player, VHS player and many other neat gifts.  I watched Garden State, good movie, Natalie Portman is very pretty.  I got to talk to someone and tell them a few things that I needed to tell them.  I think that the new year will be a good year.  My civic is doing beautiful.  

Oh last night I went and played football, I am so good.  Then went to Matt's to make burgers.  Well I couldn't get the fire started because there was no firestarters, so I said, ""Matt, do you have GASOLINE?""  Well, he comes back with gasoline, I was bending over getting charcole that was wet to put in the fire so he could soak it with gas, well the genius...poured gas in the fire WITH NO WARNING!!!  He accidently slung some gas on my leg, well guess what follows the gas, that is right...THE FIRE!!!!  Next thing I knew I looked down and my calf was on fire...ON FIRE!!  I screamed because he pulled the gas away on my side which made fire go all around me.  BUT when I stood up I saw MY LEG, so I screamed a little more and put it out.  I was upset, needless to say.

Nothing to big planned for anything.  I am going to stay till the 4th so I can take my Grandparents home and spend some more time in Dallas before I leave.  I am ready to get back home but take some people with me.  Oh when I do get home I am going to get a cat so I can have some company, I am thinking that my cat and Corey's dog will get along."

I didn't do bad at all, but I made a C in the class that was a pain in the ASS...that is right Geology, the study of the earth.  It didn't hurt me that bad, I am still good enough to get money, considering the number of hours I took.  I am taking 16 more this next semester, and none of them will be as bad as Geology, I shouldn't have taken a senior level class my first semester but I needed some kind of stretch.

Nothing exciting happens.  I was sitting in my car and watched a lady get hit by a guy.  I was the only witness who saw it so I had to stay there and say it was the lady's fault, which it was.  She pulled out infront of him.  I missed my 8:00 class for that and it was not worth it.  I hate being such a nice person sometimes.  I just want to go home and see my family, fuck anything else.  Nothing else matters."

The only thing that sucks about this semester ending is, in Geology I have a test on Wednesday, Friday and then the final on MONDAY!!  Wow, that is awesome.  Other then that finals won't be any harder then high school.  I did have good studying skills in high school so this thing they call college isn't all that much harder.


I am thinking about making my major Speech Pathology which I will have a Masters, having a B.S. in History, and minor in Adminastration.  History is only 30 hours to major in, so that is like a semester and a half of summer, of nothing but history.  Not that hard for a sponge mind like mine.  What I was going to do was Elementy Ed, but I can use my Master Degree in a much higher paying, and better job.  I will help kids with lisp, and things like that.  I went to one when I was young and look how I talk now...well I talk better when I have to.  Don't think I am going to be a speech teacher, I could never lower myself to that level.  I would be a history teacher way before.

I picked up my trumpet yesterday...felt wierd.  I sounded as good as the last time I played in High School, that just shows that I had some raw talent, I never practed...well out of sectionals.  I count that as practice. Or right before DC, I did work my ass off to be the best.  But rather then that, I played junk I had copies of."

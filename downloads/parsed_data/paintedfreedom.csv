I went to the barn yesterday to watch my leaser's lesson. Freedom got a new stall ;) The lesson went well! The excersise of the week is the turnback, which most horses hate, and of course Freedom is no exception. But Alison did great, and eventually he was doing it wonderfully (as wonderful as Freedom's jumping gets right now lol)! I can't wait for my lesson!

And now another song...

Fly Away (this isn't the whole song...)- Sugarland

O I swear this town
Gets smaller every day
And I'm waitin' for my chance
I'm gonna break away
I'm so sick and tired of being told what's good for me
People got lots of ideas
Of who I'm supposed to be


Wow a double whammy. Aren't you lucky. Here's another one.

Baby Girl - Sugarland

They say
This town
Stars stay up all night
Well I 
Don't know
Can't see em
Through the glow of the neon lights
And it's a
Long way
From here
To the place where the homefires burn
Well it's 2000 miles and one left turn

Dear mom and dad
Please send money
I'm so broke that it ain't funny
Well I don't need much just enough to get me through
Please don't worry cuz I'm alright
See I'm playin here at the bar tonight
This time I'm gonna make our dreams come true
Well I love you more than anything in the world
Love your Baby Girl

Black top
Blue Sky
Big town full of little white lies
Where everybody's your friend
You can never be sure
They'll promise
Fancy cars and diamond rings
And all sorts of shiny things
But girl you remember what your knees are for

Dear mom and dad
Please send money
I'm so broke that it ain't funny
Well I don't need much just enough to get me through
Please don't worry cuz I'm alright
See I'm playin here at the bar tonight
This time I'm gonna make our dreams come true
Well I love you more than anything in the world
Love your Baby Girl

I know that I am on my way
Well I can tell every time I play
And I know it's worth all the dues I'll pay
When I can write to you and say

Dear mom and dad
I'll send money
I'm so rich that it ain't funny
Well it otta be more than enough to get you through
Please don't worry cuz I'm alright
See I'm staying here at the Ritz tonight
Whatdya know we made our dreams come true

And there are fancy cars and diamond rings
But you know that they don't mean a thing
They all add up to nothin compared to you

Well remember me in ribbons and curls
I still love you more than anything in the world
Love your Baby Girl

Since there's very little hope for the Bears, I'm gonna watch the Pats games now too lol. Hey, look on the bright side, as of today, the Bears are undefeted lol. Commercials this year weren't that good. There were a few funny ones, though. Here's my favorites:

1. The one with the cat and the guy who was cooking something red and chopping something with a knife as he was making dinner (in his girlfriend's apartment, the cat is his girlfriend's). The cat spills the red sauce and gets some on itself, as well as all over the floor. The guy, still holding the knife, picks the cat up by its neck right over the sauce on the floor. The guy's girlfriend walks in and sees the guy holding the cat and a knife over what looks like blood lol. The motto was ""Don't judge too quickly. We won't."" lol.
2. The one in the first quarter with the ""10 things needed for a good commercial""
3. The one with the convertible in the middle of winter, when the guy literally freezes at a stoplight lol.
4. The one with all the football players singing ""Tomorrow"", you know, the song from Annie, because as of tomorrow (now today), they're all undefeated again. lol.


Anyways, I rode yesterday. Freedom was so good. I rode with saddle for awhile, then rode a little bareback too. I brought a camera, and took lotsa good pictures! Hopefully I'll be able to post some here. After I rode, I let Freedom out in the arena and he rolled twice, then just kinda walked around for awhile. When I went to catch him, he wouldn't let me cuz he wanted to roll 2 more times lol. He's so adorable. Since he was such a good boy, I gave him his favorite treat, a peppermint nickers bar! lol. I'm gonna get him a bunch of those for his birthday (April 22!) lol.


I've been doing a lot of studying for horsebowl, and I know all of the new questions in section A. Go ahead, ask me about how grain is prossesed, about different types of forages, or what an oat groat is, I dare ya... lol. Section A is all about a horse's feed/diet. Try me... lol"

Bless The Broken Road - Rascall Flatts

I set out on a narrow way
Many years ago.
Hoping I would find true love
Along the broken road.
Well I got lost in time or two
Wiped my brow, kept pushin through
I couldn't see how every sign
Pointed straight to you.

Every long lost dream
Led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart
They were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way
Into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God Bless The Broken Road
Led me straight to you."

1. A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart.
  
2. The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can't have them.
  

3. Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile.
  

4. To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.
  

5. Don't waste your time on a man/woman, who isn't willing to waste their time on you.
  

6. Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one, so that when we finally meet the person, we will know how to be grateful.
  

7. Don't cry because it is over, smile because it happened.
  

8. There's always going to be people that hurt you so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around.   

9. Make yourself a better person and know who you are before you try and know someone else and expect them to know you.
  

10. Don't try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to.


Ever hear a song or read something that like... completely describes you? Well there ya go. 

I'm so confused right now. One of my friends just got a boyfriend and now this guy that I know is all weird about it... I don't know. I don't feel like explaining it. g2g now. later."

"event","Ok, I told you this journal would get more interesting, so here it is. Sorry I haven't updated in awhile, I've been really busy.

So I had a riding lesson on Thursday and it went ok, I guess. We were doing a REALLY hard excersise. It was three jumps, set up like an ABC, except the middle one was moved out to the side about 6 feet, so it was like a zig-zag line thing. In order to jump all three, you had to basically turn the horse in mid air. We warmed up by circling in between fences, which was still hard with a horse like Freedom, especially when the fences are so close together. He was being really goofy about going to the first fence, and it took a lotta leg to get him to jump it. He was pretty ok with the warmup for awhile. Eventually we moved on to the actual excersise, without the circles. He was really anxious and, once again, didn't want to jump the first fence. Finally I got him over it and managed to get him to turn to the second one too, but he just wouldn't turn to the third one. By now he was tired and starting to sweat, so we just circled in and jumped the third one alone. Overall, a decent lesson.

I rode on Friday too, but nothing really too exciting happened during the ride. In the barn though, well, that's a different story. My friend's dog ran away and almost got hit by a car. My other friend is going to Pennsylvania for a ""family emergency"" (I know what it is, but I'm not gonna post it here), and she doesn't know how long they're going to be gone.

Yesterday was an interesting day. My friend's horse, the one who's going to Pennsylvania, left at around 10:00. I got to the barn at 7:30 since my sister had a riding lesson and Horsebowl was at 9:30, and spent a lot of time brushing and being with that beautiful mare. I must say, I'm going to miss her a lot. She was my favorite horse to bring in from the paddock. She had such a personality lol. 

Anyways, at 9:30 we left for Horsebowl (it's like a horse quiz thingy team). Oh, did I metion that we disected horse legs? Yeah, that was interesting. We walked in and there's these legs, just lying on the tables. One of our coaches is a farrier, and she brought some or her farrier friends with her. She started by showing us some farrier tools, whcih we'll need to know for competition. She made sure we knew the difference between a four point and a prichol, nippers and clenched hoof tongs, and just about everything else a farrier could ever need. Then we got into groups and selected a leg. (WARNING: The following may not be suitable for those with a weak stomach. lol) Ours was the only one that was cut off above the knee. It was a chestnut with a sock, and later we found out that it was an Arabian named Magic who had to be ""put down"" because he had mouth cancer and couldn't eat. Our other coach gave us razors to use to cut it and warned us that they were very sharp (shocking, I know). My friends that did this last year dug right in, beginning to cut the skin off. For awhile I just kind of watched, because at first it looked REALLY gross, them peeling away the skin and exposing all the bone and muscle. I started using only one hand, because the thought of touching and taking apart a dead horse leg still kinda made me sick. One of my coach's farrier friends, you know, the kind off rough and tumble cowboy hardy farrier guys, came up to me and noticed my squeamish expression. He's like, hey don't worry, it doesn't bite, and then he takes his BARE HANDS and starts tearin' apart the skin (we had gloves on). Turns out that the only guy in our horsebowl team did the whole thing with his bare hands. Anyways, I eventually got used to it. Once we got the skin off, we found the tendons and played the ""puppet"" game, when you pull the tendons and make the leg move, just like it would on a live horse. One of my firends cut off the muscle and was ""playing"" with it, and all the farriers were joking that she should go cook it in the kitchen. Either that or fry it on the hood of their car. Anyways, she was cutting it open and stuff, and it looked pretty cool. Then we started to cut off the rest of the muscle, and as we did, we found these little lumpsin the horse's knee. We asked our coach what it was, and she said it was probably cancer that spread from the horse's mouth. That was kinda cool to see that. Once the muscle was off, we started to take the hoof wall off. That was really hard, if you can imagine. When it was finally off, we looked at the laminae, which was interesting. Then we started to ""explore"" the joints. All along the way we'd been finding veins and such, which was kinda cool too. Our coach showed us the bones of a leg they disected earlier, and that was cool too lol. That's pretty much it. It was a lot more fun than it sounds here, although it was kinda gross and sad at first.

Next week we're picking teams for Horsebowl. We have enough people to make 3 junior teams this year. Our competition is next month, and I'm kind of worried because our best member is my friend who's going to Pennsylvania. I hope she's back soon. We're gonna miss her :(

Oh, and just for the record, I HATE pop-up ads. I'm not interested in buiying tupperware our diet patches our visiting an online dating site and I never will be! And everyone knows that those ""you're the 10,000,000th visitor and you've won a free iPod"" ads are fake, so why do we still have them!? And now they have VIDEOS on the ads too. As if our computer wasn't slow enough. lol.

Wow, that was long. Gotta go."

Breakaway - Kelly Clarkson
I grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Tryin not to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I'd pray
I could breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes til I tuch the sky
And I'll
Make a wish (make a wish)
Take a chance (take a chance)
Make a change
And Breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love 
I'll take a risk
Take a chance
Make a change
And Breakaway



That's the best part... more later, my sis is kicking me off now..."

This will sound silly to anyone that doesn't know horses, but he is one of my best friends. I ride him 3 days a week. We show in eventing. He's a wonderful dressage horse, but needs work in jumping. He has so much personality lol. I taught him to give kisses, and now he doesn't just give them, he asks for them lol. He is absolutely adorable and I love him so much!

Besides horses, I really like music. My favorite band is Simple Plan, but I also like other stuff, including country. I also love to ski and want to learn how to snowboard. I play tennis and am learning how to play golf."

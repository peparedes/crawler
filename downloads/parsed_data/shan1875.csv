<P>&nbsp;so your going to see less entries coming from me, just because if you really want to know what's going on in my life- pick up the phone and call me </P>
<P>basically i've grown out of bitching about everything onto a page where everyone sees- doesn't exactly know what im writing about and wonders what the hell im talking about anyway </P>
<P>I know it might have come in handy in the past- you know come on and find out if I wrote about being pissed at you for some reason- but now for future reference- if you think im pissed at you, you're probably right, save yourself the hassle of coming online to see that </P>
<P><STRONG>Some last words...</STRONG></P>
<P>I just feel like so many things are changing in my life- like im being pushed away from the people that mean the most to me,&nbsp;well im done </P>
<P>im done trying to get your attention, to keep you around- to make things better all the time</P>
<P>&nbsp;im done trying to heal old wounds to mend old friendships- or try and continue friendships with my 50% and not yours </P>
<P>im done with the bullshit that keeps me up at night wondering where it all went wrong </P>
<P>Im just done... </P>
<P>im ready to start fresh- to keep the people -who make me feel happy- in my life... the people who make me feel wanted </P>
<P>it just kinda sucks sometimes when you look back at some amazing memories and realize that those people just aren't the same anymore, and it's time to stop wishing they were </P>

see the thing is, is that when you make fun of me, I take it like a personal attack at me, I dont know why, I just do -that's the way it is, and I dont think that will ever change.

"event","<P>see this is the thing, it's not that I care that you are totally infatuated&nbsp;with my boyfriend, that I can deal with, because at the end of the day, he'll <STRONG>still</STRONG> be with me and not you</P>
<P>&nbsp;what bothers me, is that for some reason you've convinced yourself that theres something between you two, which clearly isn't true, and in turn,&nbsp;have continued to compulsively&nbsp; lie about shit that ""goes on"" between the 2 of you, theres my problem</P>
<P>&nbsp;there will <STRONG>never</STRONG> be anything between you two, ever. and lying about that shit, yeah that still wont make it true. </P>
<P>and you think I believe the first thing I hear...actually I believe what your friends have said. or are they just making that up?? yeah doubt it </P>
<P>I never said I was done or over this and I wont be done until you stop talking shit, making shit up </P>
<P>actually it's not that I even care so much, it's quite&nbsp;humorous that you'd go to such extremes, work so hard&nbsp;to try and get what you want. well sorry... he's mine and that's not going to change no matter what you say, actually no im not sorry at all </P>
<P>and dont worry theres not an <STRONG>ounce</STRONG> of sympathy coming from me, you did this all to yourself, you want what I have,and have had for the past <STRONG><FONT size=3>2 years</FONT></STRONG>. I guess you just can't get it through your head that he just doesn't want you, and the only thing your doing is wasting your time. </P>
<P>and you say give it up? what you think im&nbsp;threatened by your little obsession? please, <FONT size=5><STRONG><FONT size=3>you dont have shit on me</FONT> </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>and obviously you have a guilty&nbsp; conscious if your writing this bullshit, but apparently it's ""not about me"" oh.. of course not, just like... he got you a birthday gift and you chill after school and he calls you all the time</P>
<P>&nbsp;your full of shit, and your fucking two faced, trying to be all nice in the halls, when all you want is him or for me to believe your actually&nbsp;a friend- dont worry, you never fooled me for a second</P>
<P>&nbsp;and even if you do stop lying (which I dont think is possible for you) I still wont like you- and neither will Robby </P>
<P>Im just so surprised your friends put up with your bullshit all the time, not that I care, there just wasting there time just like you are...</P>
<P>you wanna be done? cut the shit, the whole obessive complusive thing isn't working to well for ya anyway- its really not to appealing for boys, not that it was ever going to happen with him anyway</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

all I have to say- is two can play this game..."

<P>and you know I never really&nbsp;used to have a problem with you until you started making shit up about you and my boyfriend, so dont even sit back and pretend like your the&nbsp;victim here</P>
<P>the minute you stop talking shit, the minute&nbsp;I dont have a problem with you... but I dont know that might be hard for you to stop lying</P>"

I moved back home to my mommas to save money... finally finished at CCC. Degree in Mathematics and in Engineering. woooo took like 4 years. Now I'm applying to NCU, Texas a&m, Rowan, aaaand.... Stockton in case i dont get accepted anywhere else. I work with Jules at a doctors office and it rules because we just make noises at eachother all day instead of really communicating. 

Me and Jeffrey are hanging out later today. I bet Tara is gonna be super jealous. we hang out alllll the time. loves me some jeffykins. 

and im still single because i pretty much find any suitable mate eventually disappointing and boring. One day i plan to make a robot husband so his lack of personality and smarts will be normal and he wont have feelings that i could potentially hurt."

school starts again august 28th. taking biology...english...calc...and some drafting course that its going to be way easy because i already took 4 years of it already. im going to talk to the prof. about moving up to a different level in the course or some crap, i dont want to decide to sleep in instead of go to class because its all stupid shit of drawing squares.

umm...what else is new...oh my kitten is fucking annoying, but thats not new, we need to chop his balls of asap. 

i remember reading chris' entry a while ago and he mentioned something about relationships being a constant work in progress. somethin like that i forget. but yeah i completely agree. it sounds completely cliche but im sure some of you understand that communication is extremely important. when you just start assuming what someone is going to say or what theyre thinking, and just dont bother saying something because you think you know it already, i dunno how to explain it but its stupid. taking someone for granted is such an insult to them.

kids at overbrook are dumb as shit.

PINE HILL -- Overbrook Senior High School was in an emergency lockdown for about three hours this morning after an assistant principal found a single, unspent bullet in a second-floor hallway.

A 17-year-old male student had found the bullet, carried it to school and dropped it while walking down the hallway, according to a police investigation.

A search by teams of teachers and administrators of all students and lockers did not turn up any weapons, said Cheryl Francesco, secretary to the school's principal.

The bullet was found about 7:23 a.m. The school went into immediate lockdown with the children kept in homeroom.

The students were released to class about 10:40 a.m, Francesco said.

The male student was charged with disorderly conduct and released to his parents.

The school has about 950 students. Letters explaining the incident were sent home with students."

second night was spent in....missouri i think. no....kansas. that  day we drove sooo far. kansas is sweeeet its so pretty. colorodo we spent the night in vail. drove through the rockies. it was sooo beautiful. then spent a night in las vegas. i love that city so much...oh and apartments are really really cheap there so unless we find something better in cali i might be in las vegas for a few months. id have to convince some of you guys to take a flight out here.

one night we stayed in hungtington beach CA, the next two in santa barbera, now we just spent two nights in san francisco. i love this city. its sooo expensive to live here though. 

im taking lots of pictures.

ricardo and jules were in my dream last night. i was in a cafeteria at highschool or junior high and upper classmen got to choose from the really good buffet so i had her go up and grab lots of good food for me, then i was walking around looking for a table to sit at and ricardo was sitting with all the lame ass drama nerds, so i went and sat with kids that look like people i know, but i didnt know them. then some bitch had all these shirts set up in the back of the place with shirts and shit and i was like, nooo i can screen shirts let me put stuff here.

Being born on the 13th day of the month should help make you a better manager and organizer, but it may also give you a tendency to dominate people a bit. 
You may be more responsible and self-disciplined than you realize. 
Sincere and honest, you are a serious, hard working individual.

Your feeling are likely to seem somewhat repressed at times. 
You are apt to be much more practical, rational, and conscious of details. 
Your intolerance and insistence on complete accuracy can be irritating to some.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatdoesyourbirthdatemeanquiz/"">What Does Your Birth Date Mean?</a></div>"

so jules hooked me up with this old head thats planning to open a silk screening store in 6-18 months and is looking to partner up with someone. he already runs something called fat boy products selling custom car parts and shit. we've been emailing a bit back and forth. keepin my fingers crossed. 

changing my major. dont know what to but next semester i want to take a business course, a graphic design course, and get back into drafting. i took drafting for 4 years and was good at it. i can get good money doing that shit too. 


im taking this awesome class about free trade. its a junior level course but it is awesome. i have to read like over 100 pages a week but we just sit and talk about some awesome shit on international relations and its pretty much like, what the fuck, the U.S. sucks ass. no wonder no one fucking likes us. hegemon- look that word up.


my photography class is pretty sick too. im gonna load up some pictures i took and just some weird shit too that i randomly developed onto photo paper.

so its been two weeks up here so far.

friday night went to my first frat party. upon arriving i got to witness two frat brothers smashing empty beer cans on their heads. (oh how manly)
overall though the night was pretty fun. met some people,  but i doubt ill go to anymore frat parties. unless im completely desperate. its cool though, the frats supply a ""shuttle service"" to their parties. which is usually 3-4 frat brothers that are D.D. for the night and pick up kids from campus and bring to the party. 

last night was pretty awesome. after doin some work at the library me juan and andrew were outside and kids came up with these red rags tied around their arms. turns out theres about 100+ kids involved in a manhunt game once a week. its like a huge game of hide and seek with blue vs. red. its sweet you play through all night all over campus. sounds lame at first but people are real serious about the game. after talking to some manhunt kids we went and played volleyball. first time being physically active since gym class. in the beginning i sucked but by the end i was kickin ass. i had more fun playing volleyball than goin to the frat party. 

things are pretty sweet up here, if anyone wants to come up to experience some crowded frat parties with tons of sorostitutes and whatnot, let me know"

<P>so for the past week i left and did a nice tour of the midwest. so heres a summary:</P>
<UL>
<LI>kentucky sucks</LI>
<LI>a girl in baltimore was wearing a DLT shirt that i thought was amusing.</LI>
<LI>pot grows freely in kentucky</LI>
<LI>kentucky has a lot of corn. too much. </LI>
<LI>theres a place in missouri that i think casey and gabrielle would love. its a hidden campground that has no signs, no website, and isnt found in any ""camping magazines"" its called Zoe and they have huge ass hippy fests every weekend with up to 7,000 people. george clinton played there a few months ago. its beautiful. </LI>
<LI>driving along rt.68 and 70 is a beautiful sight. </LI>
<LI>St. Louis is very pretty. the arch is crazy to see.</LI>
<LI>traffic in west viriginia is caused by vans that have spontaniously combusted. </LI>
<LI>kentucky's fried chicken isnt that great. </LI>
<LI>you can park at the parking lot of a ramada and get their wireless internet connection.</LI>
<LI>driving for long periods of time will cause your ass to grow numb, your hands to cramp up, and blood vessels will burst in your eyes.</LI>
<LI>any meal ordered in missouri is cooked within 5 minutes. seriously, i wouldnt get a chance to eat half of my salad before my meal was in front of me. i thought this was awesome compared to the diner.</LI>
<LI>its easy to dine and ditch at geno's pizza in west virginia.</LI>
<LI>west virginians will complain to no end about their fucking dry meatball sandwiches</LI>
<LI>everyone in missouri owns a gun and dont get lost because chances are you'll end up on some trigger happy&nbsp;coked out hick's property</LI>
<LI>it seems that everyone that isnt from new jersey is really friendly. it kinda throws you off at first but its nice to get used to.</LI>
<LI>wawa's are still the best. and so is diner coffee.</LI>
<LI>blankets from hotels are so soft.</LI>
<LI>blankets from hotels are even more soft when theyre in my car when im taking a nap at a rest stop.</LI>
<LI>in some state, i forget which, i came across a rest stop with tons of stores inside, an upstairs, and people selling meth. </LI></UL>
<P>theres tons of other random facts.</P>
<P>i still havent packed for school.</P>
<P>i leave tomorrow.</P>
<P>bye bye everyone. <BR></P>"

crazy dream last night:

driving around somewhere with someone else. i remember it was a girl but im not sure if it was sherrie or juli. driving driving driving....this is hazy i dont remember where we were, maybe philly? there was a bum in the car with us. he was drinking. i was driving. we were trying to find our way home. we reached a bridge. it was a draw bridge. it was dark. followed a car up the bridge. the bridge suddenly ended. i knew going up the bridge was up  but we kept going. so we're flying over the edge. in the air over water. we landed in the water. i knew what to do. the water was freezing. before we hit the water i remember juli sayig ""get ready for the cold atlantic"" i was going to say, no this is the deleware, but then we hit the water. she was right, the water was freezing. we werent far from shore. i asked her where the bum was. she said he stayed in the car and just drank his alcohol. he was dying, he could have gotten out of the car in time, but he just gave up. kept on drinking. i remember earlier in the dream he was mean and scary, so i was glad he wasnt coming with us. i had my phone with me, and i grabbed my computer out of the car before it went to far down. there was a little shack on the shore. we went inside. i called 911, but i ended up on the phone with a woman at a deli. by this time there was a girl in the shack, in the other room. she had this horrible scared look on her face. she was so afraid, with huge crazy curly blonde hair. she left and came back with a knife, so i kept holding the door as i told the woman at the deli ""call the police, my car fell off the bridge on 76, the cars in the water, we're in a shed, theres this girl here, shes going to stab me""  by this time the girl came through the door. i had no strength at all to keep the door closed. at this time juli was just standing around not doing anything but there was nothing she could do. the girl held the knife to my chest and i hung up the phone and she pulled back her arm to stab me.

and then i woke up."

anyway


i found out my roommate and room and building and whatnot for school today. i definitely pulled a stalker move and found her on myspace. then i found out theres a whole myspace group for incoming freshman. myspace is scary.

anyway.

phily last night was fun. i left really late. kris took me home and we sung weezer at the station and talked to a guy from africa about how he doesnt like ""sistahs"" and he doesnt like how he had to pay for everything on a date he was just getting back from. of course it was about 4 am. so the date couldnt have been too bad.

so Q-tip was sold out last night i hear. 


all day i have been working on hence reverie's t-shirt designs and am still no where near finished. i cant want till i get to just screen stuff myself."

<P>anyhoo. been spending a lot of time down in bridgeton with some amazing people with sherrie. one night at our friend chris' we had some punch with absynth. that was&nbsp;extremely fun. then daves birthday which ended with going to the diner. the other night had a thing at dave's for fourth of july which was fun.&nbsp; another night went to a karaoke night at some family bar where my friend bought me glasses of wine. i really enjoy hanging out with barret and sherrie and everyone else who i could name but no one knows who im talking about anyway so nevermind. &nbsp;its nice to be out of berlin and being surrounded by people who are as antzy as i am to get out of jersey. </P>
<P>last night i ended up hanging out with josh shaffer whom came to juli's in brigantine one night and to colleens another night. his place in philly is really awesome and so is pauls who lives on south street whos place is pretty awesome to hang out at. of course on the way home i got lost because me + city = being lost. so i eventually found my way to&nbsp; ben franklin bridge and of course ended up in camden and eventually found my way to 561. nothing like being a little white girl in camden at 2 am. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>today im computer shopping with my friend joe. exciting.</P>"

"event","so i was at 80s night with sherrie and lindsey and other people and they were somehow in some upstairs section that was really small and there were pools there and i jumped in to go swimming but then i was trying to swim laps but some kid kept doing it and bumping into me and then these two kids came and they were somehow evil and tried putting some kind of animals into the pool. alienish type animals that were really scary. so then from there i left to go home and  i got majorly lost and it sucked because i was on foot and even though i lived in philly i was lost. then i cam across some lady that had a baby with her and the baby was awake but it was super early in the morning and i was like, well hey rub the babies back itll put him to sleep. but then she just ended up giving me the baby but when i was holding it to take it home with me untill the next day it turned into a cat but i didnt notice and the whole time i thought it was a cat anyway. but in reality i knew it was my friend Matt transformed as  cat and he was like that untill the morning time. so i started walking more and i realized i was still lost and forgot to ask the lady for directions. so i started wandering around and came across this park and i saw 3 people of in the distance on some bleachers and one person screamed and ran away and headed my way and then she came up to me like she knew me. she was latino or something with dark curly hair and was like the other day i was with these two guys and they cracked my head open. and then i realized what i just saw at the bleachers is what she was describing so it was like somehow i saw the past before she told me about it. we started walking together and somehow ended up on a really awesome bike and she was going to show me the way home. so we're riding on this bike together and some guy started walking with us and he was really creepy. and then he somehow convinced my friend who was in more control of the bike to go along with him to follow him because he knew how to get back home or something. thten some little kid showed up out of nowhere. he had really really blonde hair and he was really tiny and he asked the man something and the guy asked him how he knew Dereck or something like that. he said something in a way that made it seem he didnt know the little boy for very long. and in my head i was like, oh man this guy is a pedophile that kidnaps people. so we'rd following him and end up going to this place with a gate and it was all shitty like and he attacked my friend and the little boy just stood around and the guy was like ""hah you guys cant escape i threw the keys to the gate and some other shit somewhere"" but right when he said that i was looking around and i just saw the keys sitting on top of this pile of rocks. so i grabbed the keys and i ran and his lady friend showed up and i guess she was in on it but i ran past her and i got out of there. i just kept running and i ran threw peoples houses and everything. at one point running through the foyer to one shit appartment i walked in on some lady smoking crack and i remember it being really smokey and i could smell it it was so strong. she was saying something about ""them coming"" or someone or maybe the cops were coming. so i kept on running. by this point i have no idea what happened to my friend matt who was in cat form but im not even thinking about him anymore. i wanted to get home but i was so lost in philly. so i kept running and running and i ended up back on my bike somehow at this one place that had a very familiar name to it. i wish i could remember the name. so im riding into this area and i realize i shouldnt be there, something didnt seem right. and to my left up a street i see a group of guys all dressed up like theyre in a clockwork orange doing flips and running down the street all crazy-like and then i turned down this one twisty downhill road that was all enclosed like it was going into a park. and they followed me and i got off my bike and for some reason i has sissors in my hands and i ended up stabbing like 3 of them while they were trying to cirlce around me but then i realized theres no hope and then i woke up.

Amity only got to play like 3 songs and nural had to do an acustic set outside but it was stil good. afterwards me, sherrie, lynsey, chris, barret and the guitarist from amity whos name i forget went to bridgeton which sucked because the drive sucks. but we get there and nural and amity were there. theyre pretty awesome. we stayed there till about 4 am. no one was drinking or anything. it was like everyone was drunk because we were so tired with the sleepy haha's. watched almost the whole dave chappelle dvd while we were there.

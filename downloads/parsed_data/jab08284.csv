Last night Pat and I had meetings with our teacher on our research papers.  Since Pat hasnt even picked a topic, he decided to skip it, but kindly gave me a ride instead.  I was done in like 15 minutes.  We of course had nothing to do, so I decided that we would go help Kelly study for a math test.  Since I can do math at maybe a 5th grade level and Pat's goal this semester is to not think at all, no studying was accomplished.  Kristin, Pat, Kelly, and I just walked around and ate and stuff, it was pretty cool.  It was super awesome compared to our alternate plans to sit in silence all night.  Yay!  I convinced Kristin and Kelly to go to the Something Corporate concert, and now Kelly's roommate is going as well, so it should be fun times had by all.  
        Afterwards we went to Kristin's mansion of a dorm and just watched tv and ate cheese.  I unfortunately took her ID thingy, but it was on accident, i promise, dont hate me.  
       I finally visited Chris' apartment.  It was one of the shadiest places on earth but the apartment was great.  They even get mail from this strange man who is probably in jail.  Fuck the date!  It even has a frog growing lab in his closet.  Peter built his own bed, which was unique to say the least.  It looked like nothing i had ever seen.  We stayed way too late and got home around 4 or so.  
Now i  get to go to some town meeting or something with alicia.  SHould be fun.

Let me give a shout out to slaveway's #1 female drug pusher, ashley! what up girl?

Well, whats up?

Let me rant right here....
People who annoy me:

That darned Voldemort
Al Franken

Ok, its obvious Voldemort is a big asshole.  Al Franken is one of those guys who has to think he is a politician in addition to whatever else he does and is crappy at both.  He wrote a book entitled, ""Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot...and other observations.""   Let me make a few observations:  First, I dont really respect people who use an insult about someone's weight in the title of their book.  Rush also was addicted to oxycontin, why dont you put that in the title of your book?  Bill Clinton cheated on his wife numerous times but that was never the title of a book.  Senator Barney Frank is fat and gay, but nobody writes a book of that title.  Senator Kennedy is fat, drunk, and killed a lady with his car.  That would Make a great book title.  ""Senator Kennedy is a big fat drunk guy who kills people...and other observations.""  Al Franken also recently went up to Karl Rove and said ""I hate you, and you hate me.""  Al Franken is such a talentless wannabe that Karl Rove didnt even know who he was.  Im sure Harvard admits a lot of idiots but this guy is so self-absorbed he forgets that he is an ""entertainer"", not a know-it-all.  At least back up what you beleieve in facts, not insults.  Ok, end of pointless rant, i apologize.  Especially to Shida, who hates Ann Coulter and probably loves a big liberal idiot like Al Franken.....ha! i laugh at you!

         A strike? How wonderful.  Well hopefully I will have a job next month.  i really dont care if I have to pay a little bit for healthcare, just let me have a job.  I dont care if I get benefits or go on strike or whatever, as long as I get my drug money...er...church charity funding.  I have seen enough propaganda videos and newsletters.  I have to go to some kind of union vote next tuesday at 5:30 in the morning...which is basically the time when I usually hit my best part of sleep.  
      I recommend anyone to see Y Tu Mama Tambien.  I watched it for the second time yesterday and I love it even more.  Its a porno/comedy/drama.  It is really a great story and it gets an A+ in my book.  
Holy Shit, i love alicia....she is taking me to see Conan O'Brien in August.  She also bought me a shirt that says, ""Marry Me, Conan O'Brien""  Hopefully he will say yes.  I cant wait.  August is so far away.  Something Corporate concert is coming up pretty soon.  Everyone is invited to go with me, its gonna be cool and the gang.  Ben Folds concert after that, thats gonna be so awesome.  He is really more talented than most singers out there.  Speaking of talent, I listened to a bit of the new William Hung CD.  If I knew that you could make money out of sucking at singing, I'd have forgot about this college thing.  I am sitting on a gold mine. Sadly he is a better singer than me.  Ok, well i am actually going to go to bed before 1 o'clock. Sportscenter, then im out.  Have a wonderful evening! ""i'm good enough, smart enough, and gosh darnit, people like me""  Daily affirmation of a big ugly idiot."

its been a long time...ive been so busy! right....
Anyways, its finally spring break.  I love spring break because I get to relax all week and do nothing.....right.  I dont get to go anywhere and I have to work all week.  ooohh i get Sunday off, I am planning to spend a wonderful afternoon in Sunny Poolesville and maybe catch a fight in DC with pat and ryan.  The fight is for my favorite radio show, ""Ron and Fez.""  If you ever listen to these guys, you'll love them.  They are super funny and are really quick with the jokes.  They have a great chemistry together and make my late night drives home from MC a little easier.
       What have I been up to?  I went to Maryland with Alicia last weekend to visit Kristin and Kelly.  It was supercool!  I got to walk around some pretty scary streets and then watching a movie.  i forget what it was but it had that little girl from Cat in the Hat, shes pretty good. 
   I was at Towson this past weekend.  Thanks to Shida for putting up with Ryan and I.  I almost didnt get in because there was a nazi rent-a-cop lady who apparently needed this job and she would surely be fired if I made it past her without showing ID.  I was involved in some pretty hardcore vandalism, hopefully the police wont read this journal.  We watched the most fucked up movie ever!  Those Japanese people are crazy.  I recommend that movie to nobody unless you want images in your head that cannot be erased.  
   The Maryland game was really awesome.  I dont know why when Maryland wins the students have to light fires in the streets and get pelted with tear gas...I guess its some way of saying, ""those 10 guys kick ass at basketball, I can make an ass out of myslef just as well""  BUt its still pretty cool, one of my goals in life is to be involved in a riot and shot with rubber bullets.  I'd also like to be mugged in New York City.  For some reason MC did not make it into the NCAA tournament, although I am not completely sure we have a basketball team.  
    I pretty much stopped watching Forever Eden, it has gotten way too complicated and a little bit stupid. Haha...i just watched Colin Quinn karate kick a stand-up life size cut out of John Kerry..excellent.  Tonight Pat, ALicia, and I watched ""Lost in Translation.""  It was really good and Pat and I are already planning a trip to Japan.  i really think we can go there, Ive always wanted to.  
Ok, the cool concert is getting closer.  Also May 8th in Salisbury is Ben Folds.  Tickets go on sale early April.....  work tomorrow....but whats new?  I cant wait to be woken up in 5 hours by major construction.  Snow tomorrow? what the fuck happened to spring.  Tennis anyone?  call me.  Basketball? I'm in.  but these games can simply not be played as well in the snow.  I guess I have to stick to Madden for now.  I challenge anyone to a game, Ive already started practicing for next season.  Let me know if you dare play me (actually, I suck)  I have ceased making sense. i must go
I am tired as shit NIght"

"event","Yay, another monday ( well, tuesday now.)  Yeah, a case of the Mondays for all you Office Space fans.  
Well, I got to work just to find out i was 2 and a half hours early....what a great start to the day....oh yeah, they are cutting my hours..great. 
   Well, some basketball after that.  I am pretty bad.  Every time I stop playing, my team says they are better off without me.  Oh well, there goes my $100 million shoe contract.  
     Econ after that.  A pretty big test.  I was confident going in, but that can be a bad sign.  I think I ended up doing fairly well.  My prof. seemed to be picking on me quite a lot.  I think he either really likes me, or really hates me.  I have a lot to say in that class, but I have a tendency to not do the reading or take notes.  It probably pisses him off that I know what I am talking about without having to read.  He also was curious to as why I dont take notes...hey, its my style.  I have gotten this far without taking any, Im not changing now.  Well, I know he likes me more than Pat, who unknowingly agreed that sending all American jobs overseas was a good idea.  Thats what you get when you let the English into America.  
      Of course we got out early so Pat and I could secure our TV channel and favorite McDonald's table.  It was the big finale of My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance.  It turned out to be excellent.  Randi pretty much was falling apart by then end and was kinda surprised when Steve didnt say, ""I do.""  Her family was pretty pissed when they found out it was fake.  Randi was also surprised to find out Steve was an actor.  But after a touching speech by Steve and a million dollars, everything was OK.  (By the way, Pat told me he would marry me for a million dollars.)  
            Owen Wilson was on Leno tonight.  I am super-pumped about Starsky and Hutch!  Reportedly Ben Stiller did his own stunts...what a badass!  
        Ive heard you should learn a new thing every day.  I think that is so true.  What have I learned today?  1. Karen eats shit.  2. I am short, Kristin is tall.  3.  I should start my chem homework before 2 am the day it is due.  
Yeah, thats enough learning for one day.  

***News Flash: Something Corporate concert 4/14 (Pat's Birthday)  anyone interested in going, talk to me, its gonna be great

Happy Birthday alicia :) 

UGGGHHH...up early tomorrow. Nighty night and other stuff like that."

     Well, it was valentine's day weekend.  Me and the valentine's 3rd together :)  Yeah, so I made some dinner which actually turned out alright.  I didnt have any, so I'll take her word for it.  I got a great present... Max Payne 2, its pretty fun.
       I pretty much bummed around this weekend.  Pat and i saw One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest at Kristin's.  Finally got around to seeing this movie.  It was of course amazing.  I'm not a huge Jack Nicholson fan but I was impressed by his acting, quite nice.  
       Work today bright and early and then some basketball with Mickey, Adam, and Jeff (Yao).  My basketball skills range somewhere between blind guy, and Jack Nicholson (after the lobotomy.)  One day I'll be able to play like the chief, only about 3 feet shorter.  
      Pat and I had econ tonight.  It was actually a really good class; some nice discussions and a great prof.   Not too many big idiots, except for this one lady who Pat and I make fun of the whole time.  She basically has nothing to say, yet is constantly making noise, if that makes sense.  She always mumbles things loudly under her breath, so the professor has to stop talking to ask what she is saying, and it is always incoherent, and even if we could understand what she was saying, Pat and I are sure it would be moronic.
       Yeah, another awesome McDonald's visit......My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance.....what can I say about this show...it is hilarious.  What they put that girl through is inhumane, but I cant stop watching it.  I highly suggest that everyone watch this show.  I dont watch TV very often, and this is the only show this year I have ever watched on a regular weekly basis. (Aside from Joe Schmo, and Playmakers, which was canceled, NFL bastards...)  
       Pat and I then came back here to my house to work on our English essays on a book which he has never read, and I havent read since high school, oh well.  I did my chem homework while we watched Conan (aka the funniest man in the world).  Who do I find funny though?  Lets list them in descending order. (actors only)

6. Robert Smigel (the guy who does Triumph the Insult comic dog)
5. Adam Sandler
4. The late Chris Farley...Black Sheep...any SNL skit....
3. Norm McDonald...dirty work....funniest movie ever
2. Christopher Walken- not usually considered funny, but he is hillarious
1. Conan O'Brien...a pure comedic genius

I know I am missing a few, but oh well.  Pat thinks that Rob Schneider is funnier than Adam Sandler, but what does he know?
    Anyway....Pat ended up asleep on the couch, I just kicked his ass out of here.  I am actually going to bed pretty early.  Work tomorrow, then chemistry, then when that gets over at 9:30, all I have to do is my whole English paper....great.
Well, thats it."

"event","A pretty nice friday and saturday if i do say so myself, and i do.
      Let me just say to anyone who can view the Sundance Film Channel, please take advantage of this awesome network.  Friday night Christian, Pat, and Alicia came over. We watched ""At Close Range"" (Sean Penn, Christopher Walken.)  What an amazing movie.  Reminded me a bit of ""The Deer Hunter.""  Sort of sad, sort of edgy, very fucked up. ****   four stars....I highly suggest everyone go out and rent it---but thats just me.  Pat and I loved it, Alicia didnt think it was so great, I'm not sure if Christian had an opinion.
        Today (or yesterday, whatever), Alicia, Pat, and I had a really long day.   First Pat and I bought our Econ book....well, Pat actually bought it, but I drove.  Then, we went to some kind of Japanese grocery store.  It was great.  I love miso soup and decided to make some. I bought all the ingredients and like 5 boxes of pocky....yeah!  Then somehow we ended up at another asian-type market.  This one smelled pretty nasty and was filled with exciting things that I'm pretty sure would eliminate most of the field on Fear Factor.  We had lunch (Steak and Eggs #1.), and then we dropped Pat off at work (Staples.)  Alicia and I then drove for about three more hours total and ate dinner with her family for her brother's birthday (which was in November, interestingly enough.)  Thats Steak and Eggs #2.  
       Anyways, after dinner Alicia and I waited for about a million hours for Pat to get off work.  Finally, Alicia went home, and Pat and I are at my house right now.  
       Back to the Sundance channel--- Pat and I watched ""The Crying Game"" , another great movie.  That was another edgy sorta fucked up movie, so of course Pat and I liked it.  Now we are watching some movie about this guy from Japan who comes to buy a car in Australia and goes on an adventure with the blind owner of the car.  This movie if possible, is even more fucked up then the previous 2, but definitely interesting.  Beautiful cinematography makes it even better.  Some of the shots are amazing, i recommend this movie to anyone...but alas, it is past my bedtime, but not pat's...so goodnight to him.
          So--whats up tomorrow?  Probably a lot of Econ studying, Pat and I will probably be at Starbucks or Borders, so you know where to interrupt us.  btw...I downloaded this new Green Day song from iTunes...pretty good.  ""I fought the Law""  Anyways.....im out like janet jackson's breast"

"event","Well I am surprised I made it through the day today.  A surprisingly early wake up at 8am was definitely painful.
      I got my car fixed and was off to work.  (thanks to alicia for that ride)  
     Economics with Pat was pretty good.  There were some total idiots in the class. the professor was pretty cool though.
        By far the best part of the night was McDonald's.  This was a supercool McDonald's complete with TV, video games, and a 24 hour drive through! Whoa!  Anyways, Pat and I were able to catch one of our favorite shows, ""My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance""...hillarious!  And then we were able to play some awesome N64 games.  I think we spent about 2 hours there.  I totally recommend it.  It is located near MC-Rockville.
       anyways...im out"

"event","Well, I guess I better get on this live journal bandwagon thing.  I mean, if I can be a loser annd read about other peoples' lives, why cant i join the fun? so here goes...
        A really long weekend.  Good overall, but exhausting and disappointing in some respects.  

Good----->>
1. Super Bowl
2. Got to hang out at Towson with some high school friends.  Some crazy times had by all.....highlights:

trash being dumped on some cars..including hamburger buns in the gas tank....a classic!
funny videos on shida's computer
drew's avril lavigne shirt
trashed ryan
hitting pat in the face
1-800-fartman
driving ryan's car all the way home while everyone else slept


Bad---->
1.  The Patriots won the Super Bowl.  Who cares about this stupid team anyway?  This was a pretty boring game until the end, but sadly the panthers lost.  Man, if there is anything worse than an exciting comeback being cut short, i dont want to experience it.  
2.  Pretty much my whole exhaust system fell out of my car on the highway....yeah that will kill an evening.  Luckily we (alicia and I) made it to our exciting destination with the help of a few clothes hangers.
3. I think I lost the notebook I had been using for all of my classes.  Im sure Pat is holding it for a large profit, Im gonna go raid his car tonight to check on that.  


well thats pretty much it....more to follow, im sure you guys are waiting restlessly

peas, 
joe"

"event","So here I am working another day in Florida.  I really can't complain to much about being down here. 
I have certain gripes but for the most part I am enjoying it.  I would probably enjoy it more if my back was 100% but I'm lucky that it is working at the level it is now.
The only part that is bringing me down at all really is that I am lonely....
I am still looking for that one who I will spend the rest of my life with.
I am down here in this beautiful place with noboday special to share it with and that bothers.
I know that most of my posts are about this topic but I think that is bc this is the main thing on my mind these days.
I used to be able to push it off by spending time with my guy friends but now that only tends to make it worse since I know those friendships aren't going anywhere.
Ok thats my down thought for the day....
I hope to cheer up as the day goes on.
On a happy note...I walked the beach again this morning...much colder than yesterday though and much harder...much more tired now :( and I have the whole day of work ahead of me :("

"event","Ok so as we all know the number one thought on my mind these days is men.  In specific one man. My husband to be :P
I know I haven't been as proactive as I should be about it and this is why I am writing today.  I need to make some changes in myself and how I am dealing with all of this.  I need to find my husband and while there are some people (friends) who are trying to help me I really need to get more hands on about it.
So here is one of my issues.....
About 2 years ago I was in contact with this guy through a site.  We e-mailed back and forth a couple of times and even spoke on the phone as well.....for some reason it never came to anything...I don't know if it was bc I was in middle of tax-season and talking to like 2 other guys as well or if he got busy or what.
All I know is that nothing happened (he was from Canada so we never even met).
While I was in Israel last year I was speaking to a couple and they thought I would go well with a friend of theirs.  After talking to them a few times I figured out it was the same guy and nothing happened.
Now I am starting to wonder whether I should contact him through the site and see if he would be interested to try again.  Only thing is it is tax-season once again which means I can't go anywhere and I have only half a weekend (shabbat only).  
Thoughts????"

"event","So I am feeling like my entire life revolves around my apartment.  An apartment that I really don't feel comfortable inviting people over to see since it is still such a mess but at the same time want people to come see.
So on Sunday I went to SI to go shopping with the rents.  I bought a table to put my TV on.  Today my dad came over and helped me put it together.  It looks ok.  Its a bit small but its good for now.  I found another one that I may buy instead and then this piece will be a table to go next to the couch.
Speaking of couches....I have been spending a ton of time (or at least it feels like it) looking for one.  I still haven't officially bought one which doesn't sit that well with me (haha).  Right now I am choosing between two couches from two different stores.  Its annoying cause they are basically the same so I don't know what is really holding it all up.  I hope that we order it soon though bc its going to take at least 2 months to get it.  :(
Right now I'm watching this new show I found ""My Boys"" which seems like my life in Chicago (except I'm not into sports like she is).  Although I have to say that I think I have been getting to the point where I don't enjoy it as much as I used to.  Confusion for another time.
I have to say that I am not looking forward to tax season.  Every time I look at my schedule my head starts to spin.  There are so many jobs that I am going to have to work on most of which I will be the only person working on them which is good and bad.  I'm not really going to be working with any managers, which I was kinda used to before but I also remember how much I hate having to finalize jobs.  I have no issues with having to do the actual work but finishing the jobs are so annoying.....
Anyway, it should be interesting to see how it goes."

"event","So it is official.  I am a ""home owner"" or rather a mortgage payer since I only bought a co-op but still.  It is a place of my own! I won't have to move out of this apartment unless I really really want to!
The closing was nuts.  Everything that could go wrong did.  The Friday before the closing I had a funeral to go to.  On the way home I picked up my messages and found out that the bank had screwed up royal.  They had lost my entire file.  I couldn't believe it.  I had to resubmit all this new information.  Then they showed up late to the closing (they tried to postpone it) and had me fill out the wrong forms.
Anyway, that is all behind me. I've spent a ton of money but I have an apartment.  Now the fun begins.  I am painting out almost all the rooms in the apartment.  My dad, as always, is a life saver.  I don't know if I thank god or him enough for everything he does for me.  He is going to paint out the entire apartment (with the help of a couple of hired hands) and move my furniture in this week which means that by the end of this week I should be able to live in the apartment!!!
Yay!!!
I can't believe it.  
I bought new pots and pans since the old ones were a bit worn.  I am going to take my parent's old fleishig plate set and I already have my milchig, thanks to Na.
I should have most of the stuff I need for the kitchen although I really do need to go through and figure what I still need (like a toster oven). 
My friends were so amaizing.  They gave me a gift certificate to Bed Bath and Beyond.  That will certainly go a long way in my apartment.
I hate decorating but I have picked out the colors for the apartment.  I'm not 100% that they are good colors but I have to go with them.  Then next part will be figuring out where everything will go.
I can't wait!"

"event","This past shabbat my family was host to my niece and nephew.  My brother and sister-in-law had gone away for the weekend and left the kids with us.  My mother decided that she wanted to spend shabbat at home so the kids came to our house for shabbat and due to shabbat ending late spent sat night there as well.
My niece was a bit sick so I was the one who stayed up with her durring the night trying to get her to sleep.  This ment having her in the bed with me and waking up every time she rolled over into me, kicked me in a dream, needed her bottle.  I enjoyed it b/c I got to spend the time with her.  I took both kids with me to shul on shabbat.  It was rather fun/funny b/c here I was walking into shul with two small children w/out my hair covered.  I wondered if people realized that they weren't mine?
I got a break after lunch when my mother took Becca and let me take a nap.  From then on she was mine again and I spent another night with her until I couldn't do it anymore around 3am at which point I handed her over to my father.
This all came to a close on Sunday night when I put her down back in her own crib at her home and ran home with a stomach issue."

Its obvious that we are all looking for someone so why should I have an issue with them wanting to try as well but what bothers me is that I am so  messed up that I think I can read people and it turns out that I am totally off.
I have these guys who spend all this time talking to me and in the end they go for my friends.

"event","Well as I am sure you can figure out I have been rather busy with work which is why you have not seen an update from me in a while.
Life has not changed much.  I signed my side of the contract on Monday but haven't heard anything since.  I am waiting until next week to deal with the mortgage b/c I won't be getting a paycheck until then and I want to have at least one under my belt before I try to get the mortgage.  I am also hoping that by waiting my credit score will come back up.  Verizon said they were taking off their ""delinquent"" off my report.
On other fronts, I am still single....gee what a surprise!  I went this past shabbat to a singles weekend.  I basically tried hard to find someone, anyone, that would come close to someone who I, maybe, could see myself with.  Instead what I got were people who were slow.  I can't do slow.  I need someone who can keep up with me.  I mean I'm not as fast as I used to be but I can be.  Like take last night for example.  Went to a singles party and it so wasn't my scene.  I had more fun playing with the dog I brought with me than anything else. 
I mean I did meet this one guy who was cute, single, tall.  Ok so he was a bit younger than me but so what!  I can do younger if they really want a relationship but he ended up spending his time with my friend flirting and I realized that these aren't the people that will want to date me.  Since I became shomer its as if I am so seperate from people.  This is what happened to me the last time I did this and I couldn't handle the seperation.  Its a really hard thing for me.  I don't like feeling so distant.  I try to talk to people but it doesn't help.
Then we move onto the issue I have with being friends with guys I have crushes on.  I mean I am standing there talking to a friend and as I look UP! and into his eyes all I'm thinking is...WHY!!!!!  Why is it that you claim to respect everything I am keeping and think its a good way to go but won't do it yourself or even think about dating me!!!!!
Argggg....
Ok so there is my rant for the day!"

"event","You will start to notice a patern of my entries.  While I am in the office with no work there will, most likely, be an update every day.  In other words, when I have nothing else to do I update.
So I have been sitting here at my desk and had about a half hour of billible time.  I really can't complain since I just started on Monday so I won't bc I know it will only get crazyer.
I have been thinking about this girl who jumped from her building last week.  I started thinking about her bc my friend e-mailed me her thoughts and then the song Incomplete came on which I thought was so appropriate.
Anyway I have been thinking that it is interesting when you think about the situation on the UWS.  You have all these single people who claim to be looking for ""the one"" when reality is that most of them are looking for ""the one who will end up in my bed"".  Here we are supposed to be observant Jews and when you break it down for the most part there are all these people who look the other way when it comes to basic laws.  I understand that it gets hard to say no to that person who want to ""play"" but at the same time its so interesting to see how these people categorize themselves.  Add to this the constant thought that is running through most of these peoples heads (especially the men) of ""there is someone better"".  It doesn't matter how amaizing the person they are with is.  They truly believe that there is someone who is better out there and why shouldn't they.  After all they just have to go to shul or some event or bar and there are 20-30 other people standing right there waiting and willing.
I wonder if we do it to ourselves?  I know that I have always invited all these males to my meals at which I provide nurishment for free.  What do they need to do other than be nice and show up.  They know they will get good food and company.  Who needs a girlfriend or even a wife if they have a different woman cooking for them every week and a different woman to hang out with every night?
I'm not saying that we can't be friends but I think it has come to the point that we have to realize that our friends of the opposite gender are what they are, CRUTCHES!!!
Yes you read correctly.  Crutches.  We use these people to make our lives feel more full.  I am no longer a sorry person sitting at home all alone or just going out with ""the guys"" or ""the girls"".  I have someone of the opposite gender who finds me interesting and wants to spend time with me. Sure this is going no where but it still counts....doesn't it?  The answer is NO!  It does not count b/c instead of spending the time going out there looking for that person who will complete you and you will complete you are spending it with someone who is lacking.
I'm not saying you have to give up your friends....just be honest about the friendship!"

"event","So after a long time of not writting I am posting once again from my office here in NYC.
I left Israel just as the war broke out.  I didn't want to leave and the war had nothing to do with my leaving.  In fact had my flight been scheduled for the following week who knows if I would have gotten on the flight.  As it worked out everything started the day I was heading to the airport so I didn't know how bad it would get for my ""family"".
Its hard to be here in the safety of NY (as safe as it can be) and think about all the people I know back in Israel fighting for their right to exist.  I only wish there was something tangable that I can do but for now I hope that keeping in touch and davening will be enough.
On that note I have started to say shacharit in the mornings.  Yes, this has been made easier by the 45 minute bus ride I have every morning but still I think it is a good step for me.  I'm hoping that the next one will be minch on the ride home.  Who knows...if I keep this up maybe by the time I move to Queens I will want to wake up earlier to say it at home?  Or at least still say it on the train?
Which leads me to the next big thing in my life which is the purchase of the apartment.  Kew Garden Hills is to be my home soon.  The apartment has been found and I like it.  Its not perfect but it sure will do the job.  I'm looking forward to furnishing it.  I don't think I will be making any major changes to it but who knows.  For right now I only want to paint the main bedroom.  I hope I have enough money to be able to furnish the apartment the way I want to.  My friends have been amaizing about helping think of different ideas about how to furnish and from where to stay within a budget.  I'm hoping to be able to close on the apartment before the chaggim which should give me a chance to save up some money to help towards the furnishing.
This weekend looks to be quite fun.  Shabbat will be spent out in NJ with a bunch of single machmir people all ""looking"" for ""the one"".  This will be followed by a day of whitewater rafting on a dam release day.  So looking forward to it.
Work is going well.  Well as well as can be expected.  They have me working on stuff already.  My first day back I was just under 50% utalized.  Today was a lot less but that was not my fault.  I know I should enjoy this as much as possible but what can I do.  You can only enjoy so much downtime.  I have yet to tell my office about my taking off for Michal's wedding.  I don't think that they will have a problem with it but I know I should let them know sooner than later.  I had a long discussion today with HR regarding my schedule.  I just don't want to get killed like I used to so I laid it out on the line with him and he came back at me with a bunch of stuff.  I think we came to an understanding.
Well thats about it for me.  Nothing to exciting but not that boring when you boil it down."

"event","Ok so nothing really exciting for me to post about here.  I know I have been really horrible about posting but at the same time the internet connection in my apartment is down and add to that the basic lack of interesting things going on in my life now.  
On a funny note the dude (hot water heater) in my apartment (or rather on the roof) was found to be busted (blown up).  Of course the school made a huge deal about it b/c they had just said something about it to us yesterday and it was on when they stopped at the apartment."

"event","So as some of you may know, while I am here in Israel I am part of a leadership program at my seminary.  As part of the program I have been given the assignment of putting together a monthly program for the young marrieds at my school as well as for their husbands.  I had many ideas, most of which were shot down due to various issues of it being a mixed crowed.  In the end it was suggested to me that I put together a monthly Shalom Bayit ""class"" which I did.  Our first month started slow and small (that was in December).  We had three couples show up.  I was a bit sad but hoped that when the following month came around I would be able to pull in more couples.
The next month (January) saw a drastic rise as I was able to get the word out early and promote the program in the schools morning classes.  I managed to double my numbers and was quite excited by it.  When this month came around I got very nervous as at the last minute the speaker backed out and I had to find a replacement as well as schedule the class for a week later.  This gave me a week to promote the class.  I went all out on the promotion front talking to as many of the married women at the school every chance I got.  I talked up the program over and over again.  By this morning I was quite nervous that I would not have any couples other than my regulars (3) show up.
B""H I can happily say that I have exceeded last months numbers (by one couple)!  I was so happy to see people as they walked in the door!  I couldn't believe the people who showed up.  Some of them I had bugged all last month and they couldn't make it then but instead showed up now.  I am so happy!!!!
I can only hope that the numbers keep growing!!!!"

"event","So I know I haven't updated but to put it quickly I have not been in my apartment until very late at night for quite some time.  Anyway a quick update about todays happenings...
Got to school a little late :( missed the first class.  Learned the rest of the day until 1 when we had our leadership meeting at which we learned that we will be in charge of two more activities :) TuB'Shvat and Asarat B'Tevet.  We spend the next hr and a half coming up with ideas for both.  After that we make chanukiot....so much fun!  I felt like I was back in gan or camp or something....so relaxing.  I kept thinking about Art Therapy (Mer) and smiled.
After C and I made ourselves a snack and before we knew it the time to get onto the Hasaah to Rammot for the Chena had arrived.  Adi (one of the girls at school) is getting married next week and tonight was her Chena.  We had such an amazing time!  So cool to see all the outfits (there are 3!) and her chatan was so cute putting up with it all.  We danced and stuffed our faces...it was a 4 course meal! I thought I was at the wedding.  Before we knew it we had all gotten our hands chenad (they make a circle on your right hand...nothing compared to the hena I got done at my friend Shalani's Mindi party) and we piled back into the hasaah to head back to Har Nof.  
And that, ladies and gents, was my day. :)
And now, since it is 1:30 I am off to bed!"

"event","So right now I am in bed with a sinus headache that I woke up with (yay).  I think this means that the weather is going to change.  I wish I could say that I was going to go back to bed but there is a ton of construction going on around my building and also there is a test of the emergency system and response going on in Har Nof today so no sleep would be had.
Ok I think if I stay in bed it is only going to get worse so I am going to get up now.
I had meant to update about my dad and my road trip around the country but the noise is really annoying.
Maybe I will stay over somewhere else tonight so I can get some sleep in the morning tomorrow.
Why does it feel like construction likes to follow me around?"

I will say one thing.  They are amazing, wonderful, stupendus and a whole bunch of other such adjectives :)
They made C and I feel right at home and were so good about having us over.
As I said I will try to update in more detail about it later.
Hope you all had a wonderful shabbat.  I know I did!"

"event","So while I am still excited about having internet access and it has been a real help today when all I wanted to do was stay in bed....I am realizing how little there really is to do.  I mean if I was online while other people were then at least we could im but since most of the day that I am awake you guys are sleeping that kinda goes out the window :)
Its ok though.....I have gotten caught up on my tv shows that I am missing and written some e-mails (I still have quite a few to write) and basically caught up on the news.
I'm actually kinda glad that I was stuck in bed today b/c by the end of it I will be so sick of the internet I won't let it keep me at home when there are other things I could be doing.
But still...Yay for internet!!!!"

For that reason I am going to be making my posts private.  If you want to be able to read them please create for yourself a journal.  You don't need to keep it but at least make one so that you will be able to read it.  If you need help either myself or one of my friends will be happy to assist.

"event","Well here I am at the airport....how far we have come that I can sit here at a table in middle of the airport and update you all via the internet to my goings on.
So I made it through the first step of checking......with my student ticket I was allowed 75 Kilo of checked luggage.....I had about 85 :)
Well they basically let me on with no charge!!!!  Yay..that was about $120 of saved cash right there :)
Now I still have to make it through with my checked luggage.
I had planned on getting dinner with my family after I put through my luggage but we didn't have enough time so instead I ended up getting cookies and milk.  I hope to be able to find something else to eat before I get on the plane cause I'm hungry.
Now I am sitting here with C, Berger and a couple of other people who drove her.
I'm being a bit anti-social but I want to update you all.
I am hoping that I packed my phone charger in my checked baggage bc I wasn't able to find it in my carry on (which suxs since I only have one bar left....).
Oh well......worst case you guys will have to e-mail me your phone numbers :)
I miss you all already....I will do my best to send you guys a mass e-mail when I get there."

"event","As day one of the disengagement comes to a close it is not getting any easier to swallow what is going on.  To see the pictures and especially read how the media here is covering the process it hurts.  
It makes me so happy to go be going there.  I know I am only going on a 10 month program but as I have said before who knows what the future will hold.  And even if I am only going for 10 months at least I am going there for that.  
Something interesting was said to me yesterday....that if I go then someone else might go which would make a third person go which would make it easier for a fourth to go......I believe that that is true.  I had always said that I wanted to make aliyah but that I had hoped to make it with ""someone"" (ie. my husband) but I now understand that I shouldn't wait for that to happen.  That if I am meant to do it alone I will have to.  I would only hope that others will find out the same about themselves.  That it is never ""the right time"" to do it.  That if it is something you really truly want then you have to just go for it.
I have a few friends who have done it...singles and marrieds.....so you can do it!
I am not saying that I am for sure staying there but again....who knows......"

"event","So another fast day has come and gone and what did I do for it other than fast (although I made it through the whole thing w/out breaking it)?  I mean I did feel the pain but the question is did I associate it properly?
We all know that the pull out had started as of 5pm today here in NY.   For my part I thought about the people in Gaza over and over today and thought about how they must be feeling on this fast day.  To think about how our people have, over our history, instituted fast days in hopes of being able to overturn heavenly decrees such as this one.  I know that there were many today hoping that maybe today might do just that but it did not.  The pullout has begun and they will be removing our people from their homes by force in just under tow days, homes that many built under the instructions of the Israeli government.  
It is a very hard time over there and while I look forward to my year in Israel at the same time my heart hurts at the thought of all these people being removed from their homes and what that will mean for Israel as a people and a country.
Thinking about all of this did help me some in trying to understand the pain that was felt.  It hurts to watch what is being done.  I am so split btwn my wish for peace and the ridiculousness of the thought that giving up what is ours will give us peace.
Oh what a mess we find ourselves in!"

"event","<P>Ok so I am going to throw this out there since I have had a couple of requests as to how I do certain things in my posts..... </P>
<P><STRONG>Item one:</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>LJ Cut</STRONG></P>
<P>This is when you have a long post that you want to write up but don't want to clog up your friend's pages or your own (when you have to much on one page you have to click back to see what has been written prior).</P>
<P>I use these all the time.&nbsp; You have seen them when you look at my post and there is writing with underlines under it that you can click on.&nbsp; Using an LJ cut is really easy.&nbsp; You just follow these simple instructions:</P>
<P>An lj-cut can be done by typing ""<"" then ""lj-cut"" and close with "">"".  I had to type it like this b/c when I didn't the information disapeared   After you have finished typing what you want to be behind the cut you close with the following.  ""<"" ""/"" ""lj-cut"" and close with "">"".  I know this is a bit hard but follow me here.&nbsp; By default, the link will say ""Read more..."", but if you want it to say something else like ""Cut off here"", you can write the markup tag as ""<"" lj-cut text=""Cut off here"" and close with "">""<BR>(I have cut and pasted information available under How do I use an lj-cut? What are the other LiveJournal-specific tags? section of the FAQ section of Help) I will try to assist via phone if you still want more help with this.</P>
<P><STRONG>Item Two:</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Friends Groups</STRONG></P>
<P>These are security groups that you can create so that only the people you want to be able to view what you write will be able to do so.&nbsp; Hey, lets all be honest and say that there are times when things happen in our lives that we may not want everyone to know about.&nbsp; I know I have these moments.&nbsp; When these happen it doesn't mean that you don't want to write them down b/c they are still things that you want to remember or want advice from certain people about you just don't want everyone to know about it.</P>
<P>This is when this feature comes into play.&nbsp; Again, another simple to do feature.</P>
<P>On your menu above when on your information page you would go to the Manage section.&nbsp; You can then go to the Friends section into the Edit Custom Friends Groups page. Once on this page you can create your groups...as many as you want.&nbsp; You can simply click on NEW towards the bottom of the page and name your new group.&nbsp; You can then move who ever you would like into that group.&nbsp; When you have finished you simply save your changes.</P>
<P>Now comes the fun part....when you have written up your post and decided you want to make it private you look at the options under the box where you typed your post.&nbsp; One of the options is Security.&nbsp; Click on the pull down menu and select Custom....</P>
<P>Once you have selected this all your groups will appear and you can choose who will be able to view the post.</P>
<P>As with the LJ cut if you have any questions feel free to call and I will try to walk you through this over the phone :)</P>
<P>We now return you to my usual rants and raves :)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>"

"event","So I am bored once again at work...this is how my job has gone for the past five years....weeks at a time of crazyness followed by periods of boredom.  This had actually stopped this past year and was actually full of crazyness but b/c I am leaving they aren't giving me new clients and I am supposed to be filling my time with transfering my clients....only thing is that I have done that already.  I on;y have two clients left to deal with.  I will be finished with one on Monday and the other one won't be happening until my last week.
So instead of doing work I am playing on the internet.  I am playing games, looking at cell phones (I have no clue what I am doing when it comes to that stuff), writting on here, checking e-mail...basically anything that will fill my time as I sit at my desk and wait for the 3 o'clock bell to ring :)"

"event","So I have decided that it is about time I sat down and started to put together some lists....
First I need to put together a list of things I need to do before I leave.
Second I need a list of things I need to bring with me.
Finally I need a list of what I am going to be spending money on while I am over there.
(Are there any lists I'm missing?)
I feel like that last list just keeps getting longer and longer and longer.....I had thought that it was going to be great this year b/c I wouldn't have to really spend any money but now it is starting to look like I am going to be spending and spending and spending....and its really bothering me!
I know that the things that I am thinking about spending my money on are things that I really want so its not like I am really being frivoulous. Ok, maybe my wanting to have internet access in the apartment is a bit frivoulous but I really feel like I am going to be using it.
I was thinking that it was going to be cheap or at least normal amounts but I'm starting to have my doubts.....I had someone I know in Israel look some info up for me and what she told me didn't make me feel so happy...
I think I have finally resolved myself to the fact that I will have to wait until I get to there to figure all these things out.  Of course this will mean that I will have a whole bunch of things to do when I get over there but at the same time it will also mean saving some money until I get stuff set up :)
You guys are going to visit me while I'm over there right?
I'm going to miss my friends so much!!!!!!!"

I've completed a corp return, an estate return and an individual return (yay).  I have also found out that I am going to be able to put one of my clients on extension which will mean someone else gets to deal with it (oh yeah).
I also sat through a QC meeting in which I actually knew what I was talking about (which meant that I was able to BS my way out of things).  
Now all I have left on my desk is one personal return to start and finish, wrap up an estate and two personal returns and I will be done with taxes!!!!!  (thank god)
Then I get to go back to audit work.....oh yeah.
I have two of my own clients that need to be worked on (going to one on Monday and the other will be my last client before I leave) and a third which was given to me by someone else who left.  I hate having to pick up other people's slack :)  thats not to say that I won't leave some stuff for others to do :P
I still need to go through all my draws and figure out what I can get ride of and what I need to keep (ie -give to someone to scan)..so not looking forward to that.....
Anyone wanna help?"

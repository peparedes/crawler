It wasn't so bad...
The only thing I worry about is my teeth.
I'm falling apart.
I feel as though I've been completely abandoned.
I'm really dizzy.
I don't feel well.
I havn't lost ANY weight.
I hate myself."

in the dim light of the night
the world seemed to spin
and I was flying away.
Perfect peace in that moment.
It still feels unreal.
I'm still hurting inside.
I want it all to fade."

I can't breathe anymore.
It is swollen with fear and good intentions.
You could get an easier grip now.
Go ahead and tear it out.
Faster than you already are.
It's getting too slow to bear."

"event","Well...I havn't been updating because I feel like a complete and utter pig. I've been eating everything in sight...and it shows on the motherfucking scale...why can't I just have an ounce of control? I remember a time when I could go to the gym four hours a night and live off yogurt. But now...I can feel my belly protruding, my thighs slapping, and my ass jiggling and it's so disgusting I could just sob. I ask everyone daily if it looks like I've gained weight. My mother flips out and gets sarcastic and my friends look me over from head to foot and say ""Um..no."" It's like...I NEED to hear them say ""Yes, you have you fat fucking cow.""
 And another thing that bothers me is that...well...HE used to tell me how beautiful and hot I was but now, he says nothing...and it breaks me. Everyone will compliment me except for him. It used to be he'd compliment me everyday...and now I'm nothing. 
 I'm not going to breathe a word of what I've eaten for the past couple of weeks because it's so embarassing...and I havn't even been running or anything...*eyes tear over*
<center> Why am I so fucking gross?"

So yeah, I think that I did pretty well today. Now, if only I can do this EVERY day until prom...and after that. God...I wish that I were skinny...more than a lot of things I wish that. 
 But more than anything I wish that he would love me. That would make my life complete. Today he rested his head on my stomach. I was so embarassed...I could have died...
 I was in a pissy mood and refused to participate at play rehersals...so the director got pissed and told me that if I didn't want to do the play then I shouldn't have auditioned and I said that I wanted to do it and she told me to quit complaining...ugh...I was pissed...I could have ripped her throat out. One of my best friends told me to quit complaining, too...that's when I knew I needed to rest. 
 I felt like shit today. I look like shit. I hate me."

"event","<center>I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star
To pray on, or wish on, or something like that
I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy
Whose reality I knew, was hopeless to be had
But then the dove of hope began its' downward slope
And I believed for a moment that my chances
Were approaching to be grabbed
But as it came down near, so did a weary tear
-I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag 

** Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills
Cuz I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold cuz these hands are too shaky to hold
** HUNGER HURTS, BUT STARVING WORKS
WHEN IT COSTS TOO MUCH TO LOVE
And I went crazy again today,
Looking for a strand to climb
Looking for a little hope
Baby said he couldn't stay, wouldn't put his lips to mine
And a fail to kiss is a fail to cope
I said ""Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified
Come on put a little love here in my void"", - He said
""It's all in your head"" And I said "" So's everything"" -
But he didn't get it - I thought he was a man
But he was just a little boy
**Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad , oh it kills
Cuz I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold cuz these hands are too shaky to hold
**HUNGER HURTS, BUT STARVING WORKS
WHEN IT COSTS TOO MUCH TO LOVE



I really love these lyrics. This song is by fiona apple, in case none of you knew that...and I absolutely love it. It's the story of my life.
 I love this guy. I don't think he feels the same way. I think it's because I'm fat and ugly and worthless...I want to be...perfect...skin and bone...a body to match the brilliant personality I have...but I'm weak and pathetic and have no control...I need control over this...
 He kissed my neck today...I almost died....and he gave my arm rasberrys...on my new scars...which is ironic because those scars were for him to begin with...

Tommorow I will not eat over 500 calories...I will only take in 200...I can do this...."

"event","I went to youth group today. I was bitching about how fat I am, yet again, and my friend Nicole was like ""Oh shut up...you're small."" I looked at her like she was crazy. I have NEVER IN MY LIFE been called small, not even as a child. I've always been this disgusting heffer. ""What?!"" I said. ""Well, you're small...you've gotten smaller....you've lost a lot of weight."" My friend Angela was like ""Yeah! When we came back from spring break I was like 'oh my gosh!'""
 All of this made me feel really good...

"event","I havn't been trying hard enough. I admit that I eat fucking everything and I don't excersise as much as I should. So, I've decided something. Starting at this VERY INSTANT I will not put an over abundance of food in my mouth. One article of food per meal and I will excersise EVERY DAY!!!! My new goal is to lose 20lbs by February 21st and this time it's serious...hardcore. NYSSA auditions are february 21st and I will be 20lbs lighter...we're going shopping after auditions and I want to be able to fit my fat ass into some cute clothes because it's a rare occasion that we go so far away to shop anyway...so this better be good. Tommorow I will record every bite that I eat and I will excersise for AT LEAST an hour. It's time to get my blubberbutt into gear."

"event","I gorged myself today. Ugh, what fucking else is new! Why can't I just not eat...because I have no goddamn control. Another thing, I havn't worked out since Tuesday...it's been two fucking days of me sitting on my ass stuffing myself and I am now dealing with the consequences...I've gained a fucking pound. 
 But today in Theatre Arts when I was practicing my monolague with Rachel I stood up and she was like ""Your shirt is big on you.""
""Yeah, I know! *grin*""
""*grin* Do you know what that means!""
""YES! *smile* *giggle*""
""*giggle*""
So at least someone noticed...and did I tell you that yesterday Iqra told me that I look ten pounds lighter every time she sees me? That made me happy inside:) I love when people notice...it's fabulous. 
 I just wish I could lose MORE WEIGHT! I feel like an undesireable cow right now. UUUUGH. I even borrowed a quarter from Rachel so that I could buy lunch. How pathetic is that shit? *Rolls eyes* I hate me."

"event","I havn't been doing well lately...I've been eating a lot...I hate myself for it. I havn't been on a scale in the last day or two...I'll do that tonight. I hope the outcome makes me smile...very few things do now adays.
 Anyway, I had a good day today for once. Ian wasn't in school so that relieved the stress of always having to watch him and Rachel go off together. 
 Rehersal was shit. I hated everyone and everything and the music is terrible. My brother was making a jackass out of himself and trying to get attention...he just nauseated me and made my skin crawl. 
 I've had a headache for the past three hours and my back is killing me because I have sucky posture. AND...I'm hungry...*hangs head in shame* God am I hungry."

"event","I woke-up depressed today. I get depressed when I realize that I have nothing pressing to do today. Also, I'm worried that I missed something crucial last night when I didn't get to go to Bernie's. I'm so fucking depressed all the time and it really sucks. So today will be me cleaning my room, excersising, and getting my eyebrows waxed and perhapse a haircut. Woot...exciting. Oh, I forgot...I'll probably do my math homework, too. Ooooh, how could I forget something so crucial? God, I hate this town. This little fucking town with it's small minded people. There's nothing here and I'm going absolutely insane being here. And it's not like I can say ""Oh, after next year I'm going away to college."" because I'm probably going to end up doing two years at the local college before going out into the world...*rolls eyes* I loathe life at this point. I know that things could be SO MUCH WORSE but right now they seem pretty bad to me. It's not that my life is bad, it's just that my mind frame is bad. I've been hurt too much so now I put up my walls and I'm mean to keep people away...and now they're so far away they won't come back and I need to be surrounded by people who love me right now but I'm not because I've shoved them all away...does that make any sense at all? 
 I blame all of this on my being fat. Like Rachel was instantly accepted in my group of friends and they all replaced me with her and guess what? She weighs 98lbs and she's very very pretty...coincidence? I don't think so. Skinny people are liked and the fat people, like me, are ignored. I can't deal with that so it means I must lose more weight. God...I need a release...maybe dad will let me go rent movies...movies are my salvation. But I'm going to go for now."

"event","I'm feeling quite sad today. I feel sad every day though. Hmm...I ate a lot today. I was doing alright until I got into a fight with my mom and binged terribly...I don't have the desire to purge ever...I value my teeth and organs too much for that so I live with my mistake and start again tommorow. 
I've lost four pounds in the last four days which is pretty good I suppose. I want to lose twenty by February fourteenth...that way when I'm alone on valentines day I'll be able to hold on to the fact that I'm twenty pounds lighter. 
I got into a fight with my mom today and I couldn't go to Bernies so I told her I hated her and then crashed about my room breaking things for a bit and then apologized because I'm weak and I love my mom...oh boy...I cried when I looked in the mirror today. I hate me. 
 I talked to Jimmy online. He's depressed about lindsey getting mad at him for flirting with another girl at a party...even though lindsey broke up with him she still got mad. Linds just wants his attention but still, she HAS to realize how pathetic that makes her look. After listening to him and trying to give him advice the best I could he told me that I was his shining star and he loved me for trying to help him. It made me smile to get such a nice compliment and I really wish that Jimmy and I could get together but I don't really see that coming because we're so different...I don't know. Maybe SOMETHING will happen in the future...but I feel too fat for him to like me, you know? 
 I watched Bridget Jones's diary today. It is now my favorite movie in the entire world. It was fabulous and it gave me hope...the hope of meeting a man and having him fall in love with me and falling in love with him someday...even though I'm fat....FAT FAT FAT FAT...it's enough to ruin a whole life."

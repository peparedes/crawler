"event","Hey Everybody!!!! Last night was reli fun!!! Michaela, Tanzi, Slater, Shane, Carlo, and i all went ot the movies. We saw the ring 2. Their were scary parts during the movie, but afterwards i was lik o that was kinda bad. I liked the first one better. But just becuz i didn't lik the movie doesnt mean i didnt lik watching it. Watching it was fun. lol. Then today, the cheerleaders had a universal competiton but the competiton was at city walk. It was fun! First we performed and then afterwards, we ate lunch at the hard rock cafe. Then we went shopping and it was originally jennifer, megan, jakey, nicole, and i, but then jenifer and megan kinda got seperated so just jakey, nicole, and i went shopping. I didn't buy anything except 4 candy. We went into hot topic, and we were spraying this disgusting fairy perfume everywhere. It was funny cuz the lady got mad at us. So that was reli fun even though i didnt buy anytihng. And also is was drizzling the whole time which kinda made more fun. Then at 2:00 p.m. we went to the awards ceremony and we won!!!!! It was so cool. Everyone got a jacket and medals and we got this huge trophy and this ltl banner thing. That was pretty cool. This whole week has been so much fun!!!! And its not even over yet!!!! I'm soo happy!!! bye <333"

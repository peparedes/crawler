<b>2008 SPOILER: My 2007 treatment was unsuccessful. I journaled the entire process because there existed at that time absolutely no public documentation of what it was like to be treated using ribavirin and pegylated alpha-interferon. </b><i><b>If you&#39;re contemplating treatment using interferon, the 2007-2008 entries will probably be of great interest and/or help to you.</b></i>

<b>2014 UPDATE: On April 18th, 2014, I began a 12-week course of a combination of sofosbuvir (Solvaldi), simeprevir (Olysio) and ribavirin, an off-label combination therapy whose cure rates are&nbsp;nearly 100%, even for previously treated HCV patients. <i>I am documenting my journey with this treatment so that others can benefit from the knowledge.&nbsp; </i></b><a href=""http://hepatitis-c-log.livejournal.com/tag/2014%20treatment"">Click here to see all entries associated with my 2014 treatment.</a>

I&#39;m a 46-year-old gay male living in Northern California.&nbsp; My name is abbreviated here as &quot;A.&quot; I have a partner; his name is abbreviated here as &quot;R.&quot;

<b><i>How long have you had Hepatitis C?</i></b>
I&#39;ve had chronic Hepatitis C since at least 1985 (when it was diagnosed as &quot;Non-A, Non-B&quot;) and was one of the first cases of Hep C my physician diagnosed (thanks to improved blood tests) in 1990. Subsequent to the original writing of this journal, my doctors and I came to the conclusion that I&#39;ve proabbly had Hep C since at least 1980, which is when I contracted Hepatitis B.

<b><i>Why are you being treated now?</i></b>A nondrinker and nonsmoker, I figured my risk factors were low. Several years ago, a series of medical problems left me nearly 40 pounds heavier. At the same time, my &quot;bad&quot; blood score tests for Hep C began rising slowly.

In early 2007, I went to a hepatologist at UCSF who ended up doing a liver biopsy, and was formally diagnosed with Grade 2, Stage 3 Chronic Hepatitis C.<p><span style=""font-size: 0.9em;"">In mid-2007, I was accepted into an FDA Phase III Trials study taking place at UCSF, designed to test a new drug for Hepatitis C.</span>

<i><b>How does the drug trial work? Do you know which drug you&#39;re getting?</b></i>
It was&nbsp;a three-armed drug trial. The &quot;control&quot; arm treated patients with the then-current &quot;gold standard&quot; of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"">pegylated interferon</a> (weekly injection) and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"">ribavirin</a> (twice-daily pill).

The two experimental arms of the study used&nbsp;different doses of an experimental drug. Subjects were placed into one of the three arms at random.

There were no placebos; patients were informed which treatment arm they were in on the first day they entered the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;All treatments were scheduled to be 48 weeks long.

<span style=""font-size: 1em;""><b><i>Which drug are you getting?</i></b>
On July 6, 2007, I entered the &quot;control&quot; arm of the study, and spent 48 weeks injecting myself with 180mg of Pegasys weekly, and taking 600mg of Ribavirin twice a day.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 1em;""><b><i>About your icon...?</i></b>

"event","The information contained here is based on my own experiences. I am not a medical professional. Use your own best judgment.

<lj-cut text=""Click here to read the FAQ.""><b>I think I have Hepatitis C (&quot;HCV&quot;). What should I do?</b>
HCV isn&#39;t something you can &quot;guess&quot; if you have. There&#39;s a wide array of possible symptoms ... and the majority of HCV&#39;ers are asymptomatic for many years. (Hence the nickname given to HCV of &quot;The Sleeping Dragon&quot;; see the bottom of this FAQ for more information.)


<b>How do I find out for sure if I have HCV?</b>
Go to a doctor and get a blood test. You need to find out (a) what genotype of HCV you have, and (b) what your viral load is.


<b>Why does the HCV genotype matter?</b>
Some genotypes are easier to clear than others. Type 1 is one of the most difficult types to clear. It&#39;s also usually one of the most common genotypes.


<b>If I have Type 1 HCV, does that mean I&#39;m going to die?</b>
We all die of something eventually. Which genotype you have of HCV doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you&#39;re going to progress more or less rapidly than any other genotype. It&#39;s simply a factor to take into account when planning treatment.


<b>My doctor says I have HCV, what happens next?</b>
<i>Go to a hepatologist</i>. This is a doctor who specializes in liver disease.

Do <i>not</i> rely on an internist.

Do <i>not</i> rely on a gastroenterologist.

<i>Only a hepatologist</i> spends <i>all</i> of their time working with liver disease such as HCV.


<b>What will the hepatologist do?</b>
They&#39;ll review your blood tests, maybe order another one to verify your HCV status, and interview you to discover your risk factors.


<b>What are risk factors for HCV?</b>
Some of the possible risk factors include age, weight, length of time you&#39;ve been infected, HCV genotype, amount of alcohol you drink, smoking, and recreational drug use. <i>Everybody has a unique combination of risk factors.</i>

What&#39;s really being evaluated at this point is the likelihood of your Hepatitis C progressing to cirrhosis and/or liver death. Only a hepatologist is qualified to help you evaluate what your risk factors are, and suggest a suitable treatment plan.


<b>What happens if my risk factors are high?</b>
There&#39;s no way to tell what&#39;s really going on in the liver - not even ultrasound, MRI or CAT scans - that can give your hepatologist a clear picture of your liver. <i>The only way to tell for sure how much damage is already present in your liver is to perform what&#39;s called a liver biopsy.</i>


<b>A biopsy? I don&#39;t like the sound of that!</b>
This is a medical procedure where (if it&#39;s done correctly by a hepatologist used to performing it) the skin on one side of your abdomen is numbed up, layer by layer, and a biopsy needle is inserted and removed into the liver very quickly. It&#39;s uncomfortable, but bearable.

The resulting core is sent to a pathology lab, where they tell with surprisingly good precision how much damage is in your liver, and what the specific nature is of that damage. It&#39;s not a procedure to be performed casually, but it&#39;s the only way to tell what&#39;s going on inside your liver.


<b>After the biopsy, what happens?</b>
The pathologist determines the stage and level of your HCV progression. There are four stages, the last being cirrhosis. Each stage has multiple levels of severity.


<b>Does that mean I have to get treated?</b>
It depends. Based upon the results of your biopsy plus your other risk factors, your hepatologist will help you determine if and when treatment is needed.


<b>How is HCV treated?</b>
As of November, 2011, the fomer &quot;gold standard&quot; of care for was a 48-week program of weekly injections of Pegylated Interferon combined with Ribavirin twice daily. In some cases, and for some genotypes, the program could be as short as 24 weeks or as long as 72 weeks.

In 2012, new oral drugs (Incivek and Victrelis) were approved which, when taken with injected Pegylated Interferon and oral Ribavirin, were shown to be effective in roughly 50% to 80% of most cases. However, both drugs had there own sets of side effects, ranging from potentially fatal rashes to severe anemia.

In late 2013, two new drugs, called <i>sofosbuvir </i>(brand name Sovaldi) and <i>simeprevir </i>(brand name Olysio) were approved by the FDA to treat Hepatitis C, with effective cure rates in 80%-95% of cases. Both drugs were approved for use with interferon and ribavirin, and both drugs have substantially reduced side effects compared to Inciviek or Victrelis.

<b>Injections? I don&#39;t like needles! Isn&#39;t there any other way?</b>
As of November, 2011, there were no present or immediately promising treatment plans that don&#39;t involve weekly interferon injections. In early 2014, a number of new treatments started emerging from the FDA pipeline, none of which involve injecting interferon.<p>Sovaldi was approved for non-interferon treatment for Hep C genotypes 2 and 3...but that&#39;s not much help to the more popular genotype 1 people.</p><p>A Swedish study called COSMOS showed that an all-oral regimen of sofosbuvir and simemprevir--with or without ribavirin, but WITHOUT injectable interferon!--was 93% or better effective in clearing Hep C in genotype 1 patients within 12 weeks.</p><p>As of May 2, 2014, simeprevir/sofusbuvir therapy, while having been proven effective in a study outside of the USA, remains an &quot;off-label&quot; treatment within the USA. <i>(Note: This is the treatment I initiated for myself in April 2014, with the assistance of my hepatologist.)</i></p><p>In early April of 2014, two Phase 3 trials were announced for simeprevir/sofosbuvir therapy:
&nbsp; <a href=""http://hepatitiscnewdrugs.blogspot.com/2014/04/phase-3-trials-evaluating-simeprevir.html"">http://hepatitiscnewdrugs.blogspot.com/2014/04/phase-3-trials-evaluating-simeprevir.html</a></p><p>
<b>I don&#39;t want to go to the doctor to get a shot every week!</b>
When interferon is utilized, the vast majority of HCV&#39;ers administer their own injections.


<b>Eww! I can&#39;t use a needle on myself!</b>
The needles used are much smaller than what you&#39;d normally see in your doctor&#39;s office, and the injection is less painful than an actual pin prick. Before you start saying how unworkable this sounds ... think about the millions of diabetics who have to inject themselves with insulin every day. Somehow, they all manage to keep on with their lives.


<b>I&#39;ve heard all these horror stories about treatment! Are they true?</b>
Everybody&#39;s treatment is different. I created this journal to document my initial interferon/ribavirin treatment, as one example of possible challenges and solutions.


<b>Can I work during treatment?</b>
Most HCV&#39;ers can continue their full-time jobs during treatment. It&#39;s not always easy, and they have to basically give up weekends to stay home and recover from the interferon shot. Treatment is neither fun nor pleasant, <i>but it <b>is</b> doable</i>.

One of the rallying cries of the HCV community is, <b>&quot;You <i>can</i> do this.&quot;</b>


<b>What&#39;s all this talk about &quot;dragons&quot;?</b>
Hepatitis C has been nicknamed &quot;the sleeping dragon&quot;, because it&#39;s a &quot;stealth&quot; infection, with no clearly defined external symptoms, which damages the liver slowly over many years. Treating HCV is sometimes also called &quot;slaying the dragon&quot;, and HCV&#39;ers going through treatment are often called &quot;dragon slayers&quot;.

The last test/estimate UCSF made prior to my HCV treatment a year ago was stage 4 fibrosis, which means cirrhosis.

I&#39;m waiting for an email reply from my hepatologist&#39;s NP to let me know if this means that (a) last year&#39;s test was simply wrong, or (b) this is an indication of liver regeneration now that there&#39;s no more HCV infection."

"event","Went up to UCSF&nbsp;this past Wednesday&nbsp;for my 6-month post-treatment checkup. My last blood draw (December 30th) showed no detectable Hepatitis C virus just over 6 months after the end of treatment with Sovaldi+Olysio.

Not only did I get a big hug from my hepatology nurse practitioner, but both my hepatologist AND my former nurse practitioner came in to congratulate me. The latter two have worked with me since 2007, when I went through my first treatment for HCV using interferon and ribavirin...and that was an 18 month sequence. You don&#39;t spend 18 months seeing someone anywhere from 1 to 4 times a month without bonding with them just a little bit. :)

Some other exciting news is that not only did my blood tests show no Hep C virus, they also showed--for the first time I can remember--normal AST/ALT scores, which reflect the level of aminotransferase activity in my liver. This is a Big Deal, because elevated scores are associated with liver damage (from Hep C and other causes). I&#39;ve had elevated AST/ALT scores for 30 YEARS. (More information on AST/ALT scores can be found at <a href=""http://www.hepatitiscentral.com/hcv/labs/liverenzymes.htm"" target=""_blank"">http://www.hepatitiscentral.com/hcv/labs/liverenzymes.htm</a>.)

So there&#39;s this new procedure called a FibroScan (<a href=""http://www.myliverexam.com/en/lexamen-fibroscan.html"" target=""_blank"">http://www.myliverexam.com/en/lexamen-fibroscan.html</a>). This is designed to non-invasively determine how much damage has been done to my liver by the Hep C prior to treatment (e.g., extent of cirrhosis) and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).

The UCSF liver clinic has purchased a FibroScan unit, and is training their staff in how to use the new system. As a result, they&#39;re looking for patients who will allow the staff to practice their new FibroScan skills on for free...but for this week only. After this week, they&#39;ll start charging for the procedure, and many medical insurance companies are reluctant to pay for FibroScans because they&#39;re new technology.

This is why I got home Wednesday nght from UCSF tonight and headed back up there Thursday morning.

The FibroScan took all of 10 minutes. I took off my shirt and raised my right arm over my head, and the technician placed what looked like a sort of ultrasound probe about the size and shape of a can of V-8 against my side, and asked me to breathe slowly and evenly. There was a series of thumps--I counted 13, although the first three were for calibration purposes only--and then we were done.&nbsp;&nbsp;The thumps are bursts of specifically tuned vibrations which are measured to see how flexible the liver is. Turns out there&#39;s a very high correlation between liver flexibility and levels of liver damage. The higher the damage, the less flexible the liver. The two scores I glimpsed before she cleared the screen were 1.84 and 10.0, but it&#39;ll take the staff hepatologist a little time to get around to reading and interpreting the scores into <a href=""http://www.hcvadvocate.org/hepatitis/factsheets_pdf/grade_stage_biopsy_2010.pdf"" target=""_blank"">more traditional measurements</a>.

My treatment protocol at this point is getting a blood test every six months, and a physical exam yearly. So far, so good. :)"

"event","My one-month-post-treatment labwork shows I&#39;m still Hep C Negative. This is called a &quot;Sustained Virologic Response&quot;, or &quot;SVR&quot;...meaning in English: &quot;We find no detectable levels of HCV RNS in this blood sample.&quot;

SVR is considered the definitive indication of therapy success for HCV infection.

Multiple studies have shown that SVR at 24 weeks post-treatment (a/k/a &quot;SVR24&quot;) represents eradication of HCV infection in 99 to 100% of patients

UCSF&#39;s liver clinic is among the research institutions that believes that a 12 week SVR (a/k/a &quot;SVR12&quot;) is not significantly different from SVR24 as an indicator of success...meaning, UCSF believes that patients who achieve SVR12 generally achieve SVR24 and permanent clearance of the virus.

So this latest test (done in August) represents SVR4.

The next test, in September, is SVR8.

But the test that UCSF and I are going to be most interested in is October&#39;s test, which will be SVR12...and our indicator of whether or not the Sovaldi+Olysio+ribavirin worked.

I will note that with the older therapy (ribavirin/interferon) I underwent for 48 weeks in 2007-2008, I achieved SVR12, but the virus bounced back in Week 13. This means that I&#39;m personally going to be more interested in my SVR16 test from November.

Welcome to the world of &quot;HepCspeak&quot;. It&#39;s a whole different vocabulary: <em>SVR</em>, <em>tx (</em>treatment), <em>sx </em>(side effects), <em>ifn</em> (interferon), <em>peg-ifn</em> (pegylated alfa-interferon), <em>riba</em> (ribavirin), <em>sos</em> (sofosbuvir or Solvaldi), and <em>sim</em> (simeprevir or Olysio)."

If the drug therapy is working, we should see a substantial drop in my Hep C viral load.

Unfortunately, it takes Quest about a week to 10 days to process the test and get results back. (They have to ship the blood samples to Southern California for processing.)

The alternative would have been for me to drive up to UCSF (e.g., In the middle of San Francisco) to get blood drawn in their lab, which only takes a couple of days to process. However, that&#39;s a 4 hour chunk minimum out of my day, especially for an early morning fasting blood draw. Using the local Quest lab is &quot;only&quot; about a 90 minute chunk out of my day.

This morning&#39;s run took closer to 120 minutes due to a very crowded Quest labs office (walked in at 7:17 am, blood not drawn until 8:08 am), and because I stopped off for a veggie breakfast sandwich and iced chai at Barstucks after my blood draw, meaning I had sufficient food in my stomach already to take my HCV meds as soon as I walked in the door.

Much busywork and business writing to catch up on, but I really want to go back to bed for an hour because I&#39;m fermished (bloody tired) from a combination of riba-related energy deficit and not sleeping long enough to overcome the riba-related insomnia from last night."

"event","Ordered my next month&#39;s supply of Hep C meds. Since my original order three weeks ago, Walgreen&#39;s Specialty Pharmacy has instituted a new policy that all Sovaldi orders must require a signature for delivery.

At $1,000 a pill, I can understand that, since a single bottle of Sovaldi is $28,000 retail.

However, there&#39;s oddly no similar policy for Olysio, which costs $790 a pill ($22,120 retail for a month&#39;s supply).

(Nobody cares about ribavirin, which retails for about $100/month; that&#39;s pitiful pocket change compared to Sovaldi and Olysio.)

So my next month&#39;s supply arrives on Friday via FedEx. I&#39;m working from home that day, probably. Even if I&#39;m not, the local FedEx depot is just a mile away from us here in Sunnyvale, so it&#39;s not a hassle to go over there to sign for and pick up the package on Saturday.

And I continue to be highly grateful for Walgreen&#39;s alerting me to the copayment reduction programs from both Gilead and Janssen, which brought my Sovaldi/Olysio combined copayments from $400/month down to $40.

I also remain impressed with the high calibre of people at Walgreen&#39;s Specialty Pharmacy. Everyone from the call routing receptionist to the order technician to the pharmacist has been warm and friendly and totally helpful. Would that my local Walgreen&#39;s retail pharmacy was staffed with similar people."

So...2 more weeks to see if the virus levels have dropped enough to indicate initial success, then 10 more weeks, and then we start waiting to see if the virus bounces back again.

#1: Insomnia. I can go to sleep, then BAM! Four hours later, I&#39;m wide awake. <i>Bummer majeure. </i>At the moment, it&#39;s just a crankymaking annoyance.

If the insomnia continues and I start to get too sleep-deprived, however...I&#39;m gonna be in trouble. I&#39;ve already emailed my hepatologist&#39;s nurse practitioner to ask for Ambien or Lunesta or whatever else she may suggest is appropriate, for those nights when I just can&#39;t get to sleep.

#2: Weight loss. &nbsp;This one, I&#39;m not bitching about. My body fat declined precipitously during my 2007-2008 chemotherapy. I wish I had access to a reliable body fat measurement system so I could track this, just because I&#39;m intrigued. The more body fat I lose, the better my NAFLD will look, so I&#39;m actually kinda pleased about it.

Most of the really horrible symptoms I experienced in 2007-2008 were due to interferon or the interaction between interferon and ribavirin. This time around, I am grateful that my side effects have been minimal...thus far. Don&#39;t worry, there are still 11 weeks of treatment in which things can always get worse. &nbsp;:)

"event","I&#39;m still processing through a complex set of emotions regarding my new Hepatitis C treatment. You&#39;d think it would be a simple matter--just pop the damn pills and get on with life--but there&#39;s a lot of stuff that I&#39;m needing to work through.

I have no way of communicating this without going into the total of my experiences with Hepatitis C. <b>(Make yourself comfortable, this is going to be a long post.)</b>

My doctors and I don&#39;t know precisely when I contracted Hepatitis C, but it was before the medical establishment had a test for it. My best guess is that I picked it up in 1980, when I contracted Hepatitis B.

The circumstances of the Hep B infection itself are odd, because I wasn&#39;t engaging in any sexual practices at that time that would have facilitated transmission. However, I did have a course of blood infection in my left arm in 1980 which I now suspect may have been from an insect bite (since I would have remembered using intravenous drugs, which I&#39;ve never tried). The timing was such that the Hep B would have shown up just about when it did, a couple of months after the initial infection.

The clinical data we DO know: in 1985, I was diagnosed with &quot;Non-A, Non-B&quot; Hepatitis. The actual C virus wasn&#39;t identified until several years later, and a specific test came out shortly after that. At the time, my doctor shrugged, saying that there was nothing in the medical literature to suggest that Hep C was anything to worry about. Around 1990, the head of hepatology at Stanford at the time, to whom I was referred by my internist, told me bluntly that I&#39;d be far more likely to die of old age than of any liver problem associated with Hepatitis C.

(Time passed, and the Stanford guy was proved not just wrong in his original assessment to me of Hepatitis C as a negligible public health risk, but VERY wrong.)

I spent a year (July 2007-June 2008) of my life undergoing a hellish initial treatment with ribavirin and interferon, only to have the virus bounce back. That treatment cycle is a big part of why I&#39;m feeling so emotionally stirred-up and conflicted this morning.

It&#39;s easy to say &quot;Oh, riba/interferon treatment is kinda like having the Flu From Hell for a year&quot;, but anyone who&#39;s never received long-term interferon-based treatment doesn&#39;t really understand how horrible it is. I blogged my Treatment Year From Hell (here at hepatitis-c-log.livejournal.com) because there was little to no public literature at the time regarding treatment side effects.

Even now, seven years later, it&#39;s difficult for me to explain to people what it was like to go through the complex and severe psychoactive effects of what was the SOC (Standard Of Care). The combination of riba/ifn makes one emotionally fragile and unstable, encourages severe depression, and often results in spontaneous crying or rage or laughter. The physical side effects were numerous and similarly varied.

The worst of the treatment side effects was cognitive impairment. I would walk into a room and completely forget why I had just done so. I developed a system of visual cue safeguards that would be familiar to anyone working in a dangerous industrial environment, to prevent myself from missing a drug dose or taking an extra drug dose, to make sure I knew whether or not I&#39;d showered yet, and to make sure that I knew whether or not any given day was a work day. I left sticky notes for myself in strategic places, training myself to remember to remove (or relocate) the notes once I&#39;d accomplished whatever task was on them.

At one point, I had to make a list of all the clothing I needed to wear, and in what order to put it on. I kid you not; that&#39;s how bad the drug-induced cognitive impairment got.

If I hadn&#39;t had a GPS, I doubt I would have made it anywhere, because I was so busy paying attention to traffic that I frequently forget what my destination was. (This I also solved by taking a sticky note into the car with me which listed my destination and the function[s] to be performed once I got there.) Even when driving with my husband, I would sometimes forget where we were going, inducing my husband&#39;s now-familiar gentle reminder, &quot;Taking the scenic route, dear?&quot;

In short, I had chemically induced dementia.

I don&#39;t know how I survived that year. I remember doing so, and I remember spending well over 18 months doing my best to bounce back from the end of treatment. I remember the dull thud in my stomach 13 weeks after treatment when I found out that the Hepatitis C virus had bounced back.

But most of my actual activities that year, I don&#39;t remember. The treatment also wiped out a lot of my long-term memories from the late 1990&#39;s to early 2000&#39;s. I had to develop a canned spiel to explain to people why I had no idea who they were. (&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sure that we know each other, but I underwent a year of chemotherapy for Hep C, and it wiped out a number of long-term memories; you&#39;ll need to remind me of your name and how we know each other.&quot;)

Side note: What I *do* remember about that year is the incredible positive support I received from friends and from customers, many of whom had gone through interferon based chemo themselves or had friends or family who had done so.

Between 2008 and 2014, my liver has progressed from pre-cirrhotic to cirrhosis. It wasn&#39;t a big deal in 2008 to say &quot;Oh, you have plenty of time to wipe this thing out.&quot; Seven years later, having just entered cirrhosis, I no longer have the luxury of time. I looked at some of the second-generation treatments, but their weird side effects--on top of the side effects from the riba and ifn, which were part of the treatment--precluded me from being a good candidate for them.

When Sovaldi and Olysio were approved for use by the FDA this past January, I was thrilled...until I saw that neither drug had a better than 60% chance of curing someone fitting my HCV genotype and cirrhotic progression. A study named COSMOS came out, showing a 93%-95% chance of curing someone with my profile...but it required taking both Sovaldi and Olysio for 12 weeks, at a retail cost of $150,000.

So since mid-to-late January, I&#39;ve been battling with my health insurance company to receive Solvaldi/Olysio treatment, knowing that while six to eight months down the road, even newer (and cheaper) treatments will be released, that I am now officially racing against time. Six months of waiting could, at this point, mean irreversible liver damage to the point where no treatment would work. Amazingly, the liver is capable of limited regeneration once the hepatitis virus has been cleared...assuming that the cirrhosis hasn&#39;t progressed beyond a certain point.

Once I won the battle with my health insurance company--which involved a final appeal through the California Department of Managed Health Care, which was formed as a result of the Affordable Care Act--things began to move quickly. (I am seriously considering sending a thank you note to President Obama once my treatment has been confirmed as complete and the virus has remained gone.)

There were some additional obstacles placed by my insurance company, such as being required to utilize a Walgreen&#39;s or Caremark Special Pharmacy to obtain the drugs, but those were easily overcome.

Once the approval had been secured, working with Walgreen&#39;s Special Pharmacy couldn&#39;t have been easier. I spoke with four different people, all of them warm, friendly, and compassionate, and they helped me navigate the financial and procedural maze that brought my copay for this treatment down to $40 a month.

So it&#39;s been a seven-year journey to get to this point...and here we are.

All of which explains why I sat staring at my $1,800 breakfast this morning--one homemade power bar, a soy milk based fruit smoothie, two capsules of Ribavirin, one capsule of Olysio, and one capsule of Sovaldi--for a good ten minutes, uncertain of whether I wanted to laugh or cry or just go hide my head under a pillow for a few hours."

"event","The &quot;class&quot; turned out to be a meeting with the hepatology department&#39;s staff pharmacist (!), followed by a meeting with my hepatologist&#39;s Nurse Practitioner (who, along with my hepatologist, I happen to adore; because I find them both very sweet and easy to work with).

I&#39;m glad they insisted on my bringing the actual bottles with me to the appointment, because the office prescribed the wrong dosage of ribavirin. They <i>meant</i> to prescribe 600 mg bid, but instead prescribed 400 mg bid.

To make up for this, my NP handed me a one-month &quot;sample&quot; supply of 600 mg bid Ribasphere, and she&#39;s contacting Walgreen&#39;s Specialty Pharmacy to change my Rx over to the new dosage. If my butthead insurance company blocks it, maybe she can find another sample box.

<b>EDIT @ 6:30 PM: My NP called me to let me know that she cross-checked, and found out that my hepatologist deliberately decided to utilize 400 mg bid because when I used 600 mg of ribavirin back in 2007, I had anemia issues that she wants to avoid this time around...so I&#39;ll stick to the original plan and meds as dispensed by Walgreen&#39;s.</b>

The drill: take meds with food. Morning=all 3 meds. Evening-ribavirin only. If insomnia results, call them. If anemia results (shortness of breath, faintness or dizziness, etc.), call them.

Most doctors aren&#39;t adding ribavirin, but due to the small sample size of the COSMOS study, my hepatologist is taking the conservative path and prescribing riba for all of her patients to maximize their chances until she sees a sufficiently large sample of patient data that says riba isn&#39;t needed.

Worst case, if I have a bad reaction to the riba (hell, I took the stuff for 48 noxious weeks in 2007-2008), she can back down the dosage or eliminate it if necessary.

Far more confusing than the dosage was/is the lab blood draw schedule. My NP simply handed me a printed calendar with handwritten indicators of test days. She wrote me test scrips for Quest labs, so I don&#39;t have to pop up to SF for blood draws all the time.

Fasting blood draw tomorrow morning, then I initiate treatment and hope like hell for the best."

"event","<i>Since I neglected to update y&#39;all here for a couple of weeks: Earlier this week, I was notified that my insurance carrier was holding up authorization of...the ribvarin, which costs all of $150/month retail. Anything to glom up the works. I contacted the California Department of Managed Health Care, and they made a few calls, and magically the ribavirin was approved. And now...</i>

Just got off the phone with Walgreen&#39;s Specialty Pharmacy. Evidently the phone calls from me and from the California Department of Managed Health Care to my health insurance carrier knocked something loose.

The drugs will be dispensed in 3 monthly allotments:

Sovaldi (Gilead) copay: $200/month
Olysio (Janssen) copay: $200/month
Ribavirin (generic) copay: $10/month

So that&#39;s a total of $1,230 co-payments for the 3-month treatment.

However...a totally rockin&#39; dudette called Margaret at Walgreen&#39;s Specialty Pharmacy clued me in that both Gilead and Janssen have copayment assistance for patients on private insurance, which will bring down the costs to:

Sovaldi (Gilead) copay: $5/month ( <a href=""https://www.mysupportpath.com/register-copay/"">https://www.mysupportpath.com/register-copay/</a> )
Olysio (Janssen) copay: $25/month ( <a href=""https://support.olysio.com/co-pay-assistance"">https://support.olysio.com/co-pay-assistance</a> )
Ribavirin (generic) copay: $10/month

...or a total of $15+$75+$30=$120 in copayments over a 3 month period.

The retail price of these meds, however, makes me stagger. I&#39;ve had some expensive meds in the past, but NOTHING like this:

Sovaldi: $84,000 (1 pill per day for 12 weeks) = $1,000/pill
Olysio: $66,000 (1 pill per day for 12 weeks) = $786/pill

At a little over $150,000/treatment (plus $400 for the ribavirin) it&#39;s not difficult to see why my insurance company fought so hard to not treat me with these drugs. Of course, a liver transplant operation routinely runs $250K, plus hundreds of thousands of dollars in maintenance drugs after the transplant...so Solvaldi/Olysio is a comparative bargin.

After Margaret, I talked with an incredibly cheerful and pleasant gal named Michelle, who took my copayment information, confirmed my shipping address, and went through some of the logistics with me. For example: I&#39;ll need to confirm with Walgreen&#39;s every 3 weeks so they&#39;ll send my next 28 day supply before I run out of the previous shipment. Shipments will be sent via FedEx.

I&#39;ve never had a $50,000 shipment of anything dropped on my doorstep before, so you betcha I&#39;ll be home that day, which will be Thursday 4/17.

Then Mr. Pharmacist came on the line to discuss dosages and side effects:

Ribavirin - 2 capsules (200 mg) twice daily, with food. Side effects include foetal toxicity (I didn&#39;t bother explaining to him that&#39;s not going to be an issue), fatigue, loss of appetite, diarrhea, rash, possible anemia.

Olysio - 1 tablet (150 mg) once daily, with food. Side effects include rash, higher predisposition to sunburn (photosensitivity), so stay out of sunlight, possible anemia, take with food. AVOID St. John&#39;s Wort and Milk Thistle. (Missed doses can be taken within 12 hours.)

Sovaldi - 1 tablet 400 mg once/daily, with or without food. No significant side effects, minor nausea reported. (Missed doses can be taken within 12 hours.)

Mr. Pharmacist said that my Hep C viral load should be undetectable by Week 4.

We can only hope.

I still need to schedule a pre-treatment class at UCSF before I actually start, y&#39;know, swallowing $1,800/day in medications."

"event","<b>BACKGROUND: My insurance company rejected my hepatologist&#39;s request to great me with both simeprevir and sofosbuvir. A review appeal came back with the same result: they will not treat me with both drugs, even though studies have shown an effectively 100% cure rate using that combination.</b>

Today, I faxed off my application for an Independent Medical Review to the State of California, which, if successful, will trigger the State to overrride my insurance company&#39;s appeal decision to NOT allow me to treat my Hepatitis C using the proven (outside of the USA) triple therapy of simeprevir (Olysio), sofosbuvir (Sovaldi), and ribavirin.

The two drugs--Sovaldi from Gilean, Olysio from Janssen--work differently to kill off HCV. The two treatments together have a near 100% cure rate, including patients who were unsuccessfully treated previously.

Separately, however, they don&#39;t work well.

Given that Sovaldi costs $84K per treatment, my insurer doesn&#39;t want to also pay $33K for Olysio.

I would think it makes better business sense to approve the treatment to maximize the chances of getting the virus in a single pass, rather than risking having to retreat again or, even worse, pay the million plus dollars it would cost for a liver transplant. (Or as my husband suggested, maybe the insurance company is hoping that I&#39;ll just die quietly before they have to approve ANYthing.)

If this isn&#39;t successful, then the options are:

1. Treat with only Sovaldi and ribavirin, and hope that the cure &quot;takes&quot;. Reported cure rates on this combination are around 60%, which sucks. My insurance company has said they would approve this. Lovely.

2. Wait until the end of the year for Gilead&#39;s second drug (ledipasvir) to come out AND for a Solvaldi/ledipasvir treatment to be formally approved, because that also offers a 100% cure rate.

3. Wait until the end of 2014/beginning of 2015 for third-party dual oral-only treatments to be formally approved.

And in case you&#39;re wondering...Olysio on its own is formally approved only in conjunction with ribavirin and interferon. My 2007 Treatment Year From Hell proved pretty conclusively that I can&#39;t take interferon for any length of time and still function. And the cure rate for Olysio/riba/IFN therapy was only about 80%...and for the group of patients similar to me, that would be closer to a 60% chance. At best,.

Seven fucking years and a diagnosis of cirrhosis later, and I&#39;m still waiting for an effective treatment. I know that there&#39;s light at the end of the tunnel, but whether it&#39;s daylight or an oncoming train remains to be seen."

"event","Saw my hepatologist at UCSF today (1/13/14). Both she and her Nurse Practitioner were quite excited about my entering a weight reduction and lifestyle modification 10-day residential program in the Napa Valley.

Even more exciting, however, was the news that they&#39;re ready to start treatment for my hepatitis C using a new triple therapy (all oral) of sosbuvir, simeprevir, and ribavirin.

This is an off-label usage. Officially the first two drugs are only approved for use with alfa interferon and/or&nbsp;ribavirin, not with each other. However, a study in Sweden (COSMOS) found that when simeprevir, sosbuvir were used together with ribavirin--but <i>no </i>interferon--a<i> 96%+ cure rate r</i>esulted:<ul>

</ul>This included both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. Since I was recently declared officially cirrhotic, this is excellent news for me.

While it&#39;s possible to not include the riba, given the duration of my infection (33+ years), the UCSF team wants&nbsp;to hit the virus as hard as they can with all of the available current tools.

No interferon this time around; they and I both believe that there are multiple contraindications to doing even just 12 weeks of alfa interferon injections. I&#39;ve suffered one set of permanent memory losses from 48 weeks of peg-alfa injections in 2007. I don&#39;t want to suffer a second set.

This process all starts with their activating a special pharmacy in Sacramento that they use for this type of case (weird or new therapies), who will attempt to authorize this drug combo from my health insurance company.

The authorization is expected to fail, which is why the UCSF team is already composing a letter to send to my health insurance company outlining the case for &quot;Sim-Sos&quot; therapy.

The insurance company will almost certainly deny the request, and then the letter will make its way through the appeals process.

This entire process has been taking from 2 to&nbsp;6&nbsp;weeks for most patients. The UCSF liver clinic team knows the routine well at this point, however: they&#39;re writing an average of 30 scrips a week for patients requiring this new therapy.

My hepatologist and nurse practitioner told me that there&#39;s a class for patients on how to take the new drugs. I just stared at them for a moment until they&nbsp;had the grace to turn pink:&nbsp;&quot;<i>After 48 weeks of stabbing myself with an interferon syringe, making sure not to stab myself in the same place lest I create necrotic tissue, fighting brain fog, fatigue, hot and cold flashes, nausea, unhealthy weight loss, aches and pains, fever, and emotional swings, AND learning to only take riba with fatty foods...now I need a CLASS to learn how to swallow THREE PILLS?&quot;</i>

...and then we all started laughing.

They confirmed that while I most certainly do NOT need the class, it&#39;s there if I want it. And yes, this therapy is as simple as two pills once a day, plus Ribavirin twice a day.

Having a good relationship with one&#39;s medical providers is <i>so </i>important.

My hepatologist&#39;s office will also take over the task of scheduling a routine liver ultrasound for me. I&#39;ve been trying to schedule one for three months, including multiple messages left and multiple courses of sitting on hold for over an hour. Evidently there were staff cutbacks in Radiology which were then immediately rescinded...but now there&#39;s a whole new replacement staff to train internally. Oy."

"event","It's been a while since I updated my Hep C treatment blog, and there's a good chance that you may be a new reader. Here's some background information paired with my current treatment options/plans.

I contracted Hep C (genotype 1) back in 1980, probably around the same time that I contracted Hep B. It wasn't detected until 1985, when it was called ""Non-A, Non-B"". There wasn't an actual test to diagnose it as Hep C until several years after that.

My hepatologist and I have never been able to figure out how I contracted HCV. Logically, it should have come from the same place I got Hep B...but my sexual activities at that time were all what would have been considered ""safe"" by contemporary standards. Adding to the mystery, Hep C is very, very rarely transferred sexually. Also, the time between a possible sexual exposure and diagnosis was very, very rapid (no more than 72 hours, as I recall). That suggests an earlier exposure.

The best we can both figure is that I contracted blood poisoning in my left arm earlier in 1980, presumably from an insect bite, since I'd never used injectable drugs. 

However I got it, in 2007-2008 I went through a 48-week treatment with (orally administered) ribavirin and self-injected pegylated interferon. The treatment was horrible, and that was labelled as my Year From Hell. 

Since there was absolutely no literature at the time of what to expect from this treatment (the side effects from interferon are deserving of their legendarily bad reputation), I blogged the entire treatment cycle, which rather stupified my hepatologist. She'd never read such detail about what one of her patients had gone through. (And that, dear reader of http://hepatitis-c-log.livejournal.com, is what you're presently perusing.)

My treatment was ultimately unsuccessful. I cleared the virus very early on in the process, but the virus bounced back about a dozen weeks after treatment ended.

Since then, it's largely been a game of waiting for new meds to come out which had a high probability of clearing the virus in ""relapsing responders"" (which is the patient classification into which I fit). 

The most current approved meds, telaprevir and boceprevir, both must be taken with ribavirin and injected interferon. There are potentially serious additional side effects to this treatment (such as severe anemia and life-threatening skin conditions) over and above the treatment I tired in 2007-2008. And, if I did this treatment, it would be at least 48 weeks and probably longer on interferon. That's not gonna happen.

While I was originally considering retreatment with telaprevir, that was nixed because of my atrial fibrillation. Now that my atrial fibrillation has been cured surgically, I COULD qualify for telaprevir treatment, but with the new non-interferon meds literally about to hit the pharmacy in early January, there seems little reason to do so. 


AN UPDATE ON ME:

First, the bad news: my liver is late stage 3/early stage 4 ,,, which means cirrhosis. However, it appears to be the very early stages, and stable.

The good news: there are two potential Hep C treatments available in January, both with 90%+ cure rates.

One of them is off-label, and is an all-oral regimen of meds from two different manufacturers (Sofosbuvir and Simeprivir). 

The other involves an on-label application of one of the two aforementioned meds (Sofosbuvir)+ (ribavirin) + (injectable pegulated alfa-interferon). Yeah, <i>that</i> stuff again. 

On the brighter side, it wouldn't need  to do it for 52 weeks; both regimens are only 12 weeks,

Worst case: I survived injecting interferon for 48 weeks, I can survive doing it again for only 12.

The new drugs won't hit the pharmacies until probably the middle of January, so I'm seeing my (fabulous) hepatologist again then, and we'll start one of the two treatments, trying first for the all-oral regimen.

http://www.hivandhepatitis.com/hcv-treatment/experimental-hcv-drugs/4283-simeprevir-sofosbuvir-works-well-for-hep-c-patients-with-advanced-liver-disease

The all-oral is comprised of a protease inhibitor paired with a polymerase inhibitor. Evidently hitting the virus from two different vectors is why the new treatment is so effective, even in relapsing responders. 

I've waited 32 years to get rid of this thing. I can wait another three months."

"event","HCV aside, I have sporadic/paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. I take two prescription medications and two OTC supplements for it three times a day. It&#39;s a bummer.

It&#39;s even more of a bummer because I found out a month ago from my hepatologist at UCSF that she can&#39;t treat me again for HCV until after my atrial fibrillation has been cured. All of the current Standard Of Care (SOC) treatments cause anemia...which exacerbates atrial fibrillation.

At the same time, the virus ain&#39;t waitin&#39; around. it&#39;s still getting busy in my liver, driving me inexorably towards cirrhosis.

So within the next 3-4 weeks, I&#39;ll be heading up to a hospital in Napa County to undergo surgery for atrial fibrillation. It&#39;s called the &quot;VATS Maze&quot; procedure, and it consists of three parts:

&nbsp;1. Permanently clamping off the left atrial appendage (LAA) to prevent blood pooling/clotting, which causes stroke.

&nbsp;2. &quot;Keyhole&quot; surgery, conducted through four holes on each side of my abdomen, during which the exterior of my heart will be ablated with a series of scars designed to interrupt the electrical signals that cause atrial fibrillation.&nbsp;The keyhole surgery is conducted using a small video camera, which explains the name &quot;Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery&quot;.&nbsp;Any time a chest doesn&#39;t have to be cracked open, it&#39;s a good thing. The &quot;Maze&quot; part of the name comes from the&nbsp;ablation portion, which is called a &quot;Cox Maze IV&quot; procedure.&nbsp;(Designed by a Dr. Cox, it creates a &quot;maze&quot; of scars to prevent afib.)

&nbsp;3. Catheter surgery, conducted by a second surgeon 24 hours later, where the inside of the heart is ablated in a pattern that will enhance the ablation scars on the outside of the heart, to prevent further atrial fibrillation.

I&#39;ll be in the hospital 4 or 5 days, then home for a couple of weeks.

I&#39;m more excited than scared, since this is the first step to being able to take advantage of any of the new drugs to treat my HCV...or to get into a study using even newer drugs."

"event","Tuesday, I had good appointment with the hepatologist at UCSF--or, rather, her Nurse Practitioner, who finally seems to have relaxed around me and has suddenly become a joy to work with rather than a shy quiet woman who seemed a bit ill at ease with me. Since I last saw her six months ago, I suspect she&#39;s become increasingly comfortable in her duties. I certainly felt more comfortable working with her than our initial appointment back in January.<br /><br />Now for the bad news: they won&#39;t let me undergo Hepatitis C treatment [again] with the new standard of care (Interferon/Ribavirin/Telaprevir) yet because a new side effect has surfaced: frequent and occasionally-serious anemia.<br /><br />Why is this a problem? Well...it seems that anemia can induce heart rhythm problems, especially atrial fibrillation. and I have atrial fibrillation.<br /><br />As soon as I&#39;ve had a cardiac ablation, they&#39;re willing to put me through the SOC (Standard of Care) treatment.<br /><br />While I could have a standard cardiac ablation (which would be my second such procedure; not uncommon for a-fib patients to go through it twice), my electrophysiologist (read: my ablation cardiologist) is staging me for a clinical trial in the fall for <a href=""http://www.cyberheartinc.com/"">CyberHeart</a>, a gamma-knifelike <i>non</i>invasive cardiac ablation procedure.<br /><br />This would seem to indicate that I can&#39;t treat my HCV until after I&#39;ve had an ablation.&nbsp; However, all is not lost. There <i>are </i>oral-only (no interferon injections!) treatments due out towards the end of 2012...and none of them appear to induce anemia. (So far.)<br /><br />The NP ordered a blood draw to confirm (or deny) that it&#39;ll be OK for me to delay treatment until the end of the year. She&#39;s pretty sure that it will be OK, but she wanted another data point, since my last blood draw was five months ago. [shrug]&nbsp; OK.<br /><br />We also had an extended discussion about eating. One of the related health issues to my Hepatitis C is Fatty Liver Disease. The more weight I lose, the healthier my liver will be, and the higher my chances of completely eradicating the Hep C virus when I *DO* end up going through treatment.<br /><br />Hepatologists at UCSF are now advocating a Paleo style diet, heavy on proteins, vegetables, and fiber, and as light as possible on grains, processed foods, and sugars. For example, I was intrigued to learn that FiberOne cereal, favored by Weight Watchers, contains a fair amount of &quot;hidden&quot; sugar via carbs that convert easily into sugar. The NP suggested I look at lean meats and veggies and/or perhaps a *little* fruit for breakfast. Interesting.<br /><br />"

"event","As I arose this morning at (comparatively) ohdarkhundred to get up to SF for an 0800 appointment with not my hepatologist, but with her nurse practtioner, I began to wonder if this schlep 45 miles North up to San Francisco was really worth it?<br /><br />I had to wait<i> three freaking months </i>to see the NP (it was a five to seven month wait for the doctor herself), and I was seriously questioning whether I really had to see THIS hepatologist&#39;s office for my next round of treatment. After all, there ARE good hepatologists in my local area.<br /><br />After the appointment, however, I remembered why I made the trip up to SF for a year in 2007-2008 for my original treatment. UCSF is a teaching/research hospital.<br /><br />Translation: UCSF has a couple of studies that may be appropriate for me, and if I get into a study there, I&#39;d be working again with the study hepatologist with whom I adored working in 2007-2008.<br /><br />My hepatologist&#39;s nurse practitioner was knowledgeable and quite frank about risk factors of treatment, and easy to talk with about the various treatment protocols available and possible side effects. Given that I think my hepatologist is an absolute wizard, it makes perfect sense that she&#39;d recruit a crack NP to work with her. I can&#39;t imagine my hepatologist putting up with anyone less than brilliant on her clinical staff.<br /><br />One thing of which the NP made me aware was that while Telaprevir treatment carries a high probability of success for people such as me (&quot;Relapsing Responders&quot;), there is also a significant risk of skin itching and rashes. Food for thought.<br /><br />And if you weren&#39;t reading my journal in 2007-2008, the advantage of joining a research study is that all of the associated medical care -- generally right down to paid parking -- is free. Even with excellent medical insurance, I&#39;d be spending well over $7,000 on the medication alone for HCV treatment.Given doctor&#39;s visits, etcetera, I&#39;m guessing my out of pocket costs would be closer to $10,000 for the 48-week treatment period.<br /><br />There is, of course, a risk that the treatment wouldn&#39;t work, but the Nurse Practitioner was quite optimistic that they&#39;ve seen a very high percentage--88% is the &quot;official&quot; number--of relapsing responders successfully cleared of the virus using Telaprevir. She also&nbsp; said that the dermatological complications could be quite severe, and that it might be more prudent to get into one of several studies using drugs with less disconcerting side effects. This could mean my waiting a year or so for various medications in the pipeline--some of which don&#39;t require interferon!--to reach &quot;open study&quot; status, but she also believed that in my situation, a one or two year wait wouldn&#39;t be dangerous.<br /><br />The Nurse Practitioner laid out a list of practical tasks to be taken into consideration prior to beginning Hepatitis C treatment. None of these were a surprise to me, since I&#39;d gone through this entire process before, back in 2007-2008. In a roughly logical progression, those tasks are:<p><strong>Sinus surgery.</strong> Any type of surgery (other than emergency) during hepatitis C treatment (at least, during a study) is Not A Good Thing. The treatment involves screwing around with my autoimmune system, and bodies don&#39;t heal well after surgeries under such conditions. This afternoon, I saw my ENT for a pre-surgical consultation. Most likely, I&#39;ll end up having the sinus surgery in early March.<br /><br /><strong>Cardiac ablation surgery.</strong> I last had this surgery in 2009, to correct a problem with atrial fibrillation. The a-fib went away, mostly, but it&#39;s started coming back, meaning that it&#39;s time to re-ablate. Needing a second round of ablation isn&#39;t unusual, and the chances of success on the second go-round are quite a bit higher than for the first time. I&#39;m guessing a May/June timeframe for this, although I haven&#39;t yet consulted in person with my cardiac specialist and his surgery scheduler.</p><strong>Lose Weight. </strong>Imagine that. Part of my liver health issues is something called &quot;fatty liver disease&quot;. If you&#39;re thinking that&#39;s why ducks are force-fed to produce pate de foie gras, you&#39;d be right. The cure for fatty liver disease...is losing weight. Fortunately, I&#39;m already on that path via Weight Watchers Online. The more weight I can lose prior to starting hep treatment, the better. On my first round of treatment, my body was absolutely miserable until it had dropped about 20 pounds (from a combination of simply not being hungry and having an erratic metabolism).<br /><br /><strong>Exercise.</strong> While the Nurse Practitioner warned me against getting so gung-ho that I hurt myself, she stressed that exercise, almost more than diet, is one of the few things that will make a significant and positive difference to my fatty liver disease. She also suggested that patients who exercise regularly seem to do better in hepatitis C treatment, but warned that this was a personal observation, not a clinical statistic.<br /><br /><strong>Cardiac stress test. </strong>Did this before. Not what I&#39;d call a <em>pleasant</em> experience, but it was necessary for purposes of the study. I need to set this up with my cardiologist, but this doesn&#39;t have to happen immediately.<br type=""_moz"" /><br /><strong>Eye exam using dilation drops, </strong>to establish a baseline for the health of my eyes. While I ended up doing this today simply in the context of updating my glasses and contact lens prescriptions, that was with my optometrist. Other than knowing that I have healthy eyes, the results aren&#39;t really applicable to the Hep C treatment process, which requires an opthalmic exam, not an optometric exam. I&#39;ll need to do it again with my ophthalmologist, because she has the baseline records of my pre- and post-treatment dilated eye exams from 2007-2008.<br /><br />All of this will put me on track for hepatitis treatment starting in mid-July.<br /><br />There are a number of things that might change in this planning. Since I&#39;m considering Hep C treatment via a study again, the timing of these items could change radically, moving forward or back in time as the study needs dictate. If a given study requires me to enter before I can complete both of the above surgeries, I&#39;m going to have to make some tough choices. Since both of the surgeries will dramatically affect my quality of life (and the cardiac surgery will substantially improve my chances of completing a hep c treatment without complications), I may have to skip going into a study if the timing is incompatible.<br /><br />I won&#39;t be hearing back from my hepatologist&#39;s office&nbsp;for at least a couple of weeks regarding which studies might be open to me. By then, I should have at least the sinus surgery scheduled.<br /><br />All of this, however, is eminently doable, leading me back to the rallying cry of the Hep C community: &quot;I <i>can</i> do this&quot;...with perhaps an &quot;[again]&quot; tacked onto the end.<br /><br /><br />"

"event","<p>Actually, what I should have written was &quot;I can&#39;t<i> fucking </i>believe I&#39;m considering doing this again.&quot;</p><p>Last week, I read through the American Association for Study of Liver Disease&#39;s new guidelines for Hepatitis C treatment. (<a href=""http://www.aasld.org/practiceguidelines/Pages/NewUpdatedGuidelines.aspx"">Click here</a> for a copy of the guidelines.)</p><p>Before I go any further, to make what I&#39;m about to say meaningful, I need to explain a few terms. If you click through to read through the guidelines or any of the other links below, you&#39;ll see these terms referenced over and over again.<br /><br />There are several classifications of Hepatitis C patient:</p><ul><li><i>Responder </i>... a patient with HCV who was treated using SOC and who achieved SVR</li><li><i>Null Responder </i>... a patient whose HCV levels did not decline significantly enough by week 12 of treatment to justify continuing treatment.</li><li><i>Partial Responder </i>... a patient whose HCV levels declined significantly by week 12 of treatment, but who still showed HCV present by week 24...meaning continuing treatment was not justified.</li><li><i>Relapser </i>... a patient with HCV who responded to treatment, but who saw a return of HCV at some point after treatment was completed.</li><li><i>Treatment-Naive </i>... a patient with HCV who has never been treated for the disease.</li></ul>And some other terms to be aware of:<br /><ul><li><i>Standard Of Care </i>... abbreviated as &quot;SOC&quot;; the current accepted treatment, which for many years has been a combination of injectable alfa-interferon and ribavirin.</li><li><i>Sustained Viral Response </i>... abbreviated as &quot;SVR&quot;, which means &quot;eradicated the Hepatitis C Virus&quot;</li></ul><p>As a Treatment-Naive patient, I responded very well to treatment, achieving SVR well within the generally accepted &quot;success time limit&quot; during the first 6 weeks of my 48-week SOC treatment.<br /><br />However, 12 weeks <i>after </i>the completion of my 48-week treatment...the HCV came back, changing from a Responder to a Relapser. To say that I was disappointed was putting things mildly. Undergoing Hepatitis C treatment is not a trivial matter, and takes literally 48 weeks.</p><p>There are some highly interesting nuggets of information in the AASLD&#39;s new guidelines for treatment. The one that I find significant is that <b><i>with</i> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telaprevir"">Telaprevir</a> (marketed under the brand name <a href=""http://www.incivek.com"">Incivek</a>), 88% of Relapsers achieved&nbsp;SVR.</b></p><p>This becomes highly significant when one reads that <b><i>without</i> Telaprevir, only 24% of Relapsers achieved SVR</b>.<br /><br /><i>This </i>is why I&#39;m so seriously considering undergoing HCV treatment again. From a 24% chance to an 88% chance is a highly significant statistical jump.</p><p>The first time I did it was one of the most horrible years of my life--albeit with a bit of a silver lining in that I found I had a lot more inner strength than I&#39;d originally anticipated--and here I am thinking about doing it again. It would happen several months into 2012, after I&#39;ve had a chance to stabilize my work/financial situation a bit...but I would start it mid-2012 and complete treatment by mid-2013.</p><p>I must be out of my mind...but I can&#39;t put this thought out of my mind.</p>"

"event","So I realized with a start last night as I dropped off to sleep, that it's been a full year (plus 9 days) since I completed HCV chemotherapy. My last Pegasys injection (#48) was May 20th, 2008, and my last dose of Ribavirin was Friday, June 6th, 2008.

I am <i>not</i> nostalgic about my treatment cycle.

So what are the physical and mental aftereffects one year after? Hm. 

<ul><li> After an initial post-chemo bump up in weight, I've brought down (and maintained) my weight to the same as my lowest weight during the chemo. </li>
<li> I still experience mental confusion (""fog"") from time to time. </li>
<li> I have difficulty concentrating (which I never had prior to the chemotherapy, unless I was exceptionally tired). </li>
<li> I still have a mild [treatable] depression, but it's evened out compared to the mood swings I had during treatment.  </li>
<li> My libido is higher than pre-chemo, probably because I lost 40 pounds, which means fewer fat cells producing estrogen, which means higher testosterone levels. (And which is as good a reason as any to keep losing weight.) </li></ul> 

There have also been some behavioral changes, most minor. 

<ul><li> I used to read maybe 50 [online] comic strips daily before treatment. Now...eh. I don't get much of a bang out of comics any more, with the exceptions of <i><a href=""http://www.dicebox.net"" target=""_blank"">Dicebox</a></i> and <lj user=""laylalawlor"">'s <i><a href=""http://www.kismetcity.com/"" target=""_blank"">Kismet</a></i> universe, and <lj user=""unrendered"">'s <i><a href=""http://www.littledee.net/"" target=""_blank"">Little Dee</a></i>. </li>
<li> I'm not enjoying square dancing as much as I used to, although I suspect this is more a function of some of my recent health issues. Most long-term square dancers I know go through some form of burnout after a few years. I suppose I'm overdue. </li>
<li> A year of living in a mental fog has left me somewhat more compulsive than before about order and systems. If I'm travelling, and I don't lay out my clothing for the next day before I go to sleep, I feel great anxiety.  </li>
<li> My compulsion for order does have a silver lining; when I'm feeling a little blue, cleaning up and dejunking my house/car/office provides an emotional lift. Now if only I could get myself to dejunk these areas on a planned basis, rather than only spontaneously... </li>
<li> While I'm more sexual than pre-chemo, I feel as if I'm less <i>playful</i>. If you prefer, call it less ""cheerful"". </li>
<li> I don't read as much. This is probably due to my having problems focusing vision during the chemo, so I fell out of the habit. However, my reduced concentration ability is also a factor. Oddly enough, I still have the desire/urge to read.</li></ul> 

Despite all of this, I remain pleased that I went through the treatment. Even though it didn't eradicate the virus, the treatment did stave off any viral damage for a year. 

I still intend to take an updated treatment in 2010, when a couple of new drugs are available. The new drugs require a much shorter course of interferon - I've seen estimates ranging from 16 to 24 weeks - and seem to target nonresponders or responding relapsers (e.g., me)."

"event","I saw my (original, not study) hepatologist today. 

She informed me that I am what's known as an ""RR"" - a Responder / Relapser. Nice to know there's a name for it, I suppose.

We talked quite seriously about my doing another treatment cycle. 

She feels that given my RR profile, I have a very slim (maybe 10%-15% at best) chance of successfully clearing the virus, even if I go for the 72-week treatment. 

My best shot is to wait for the next round of new HCV drugs. Since my liver is at Stage II, she doesn't feel that waiting a year or two is going to harm me. Just in case, she's adding me to her list of patients to submit to new studies.

More importantly, she's more worried about my fatty liver disease than about HCV damage. 

In this context, she was honestly delighted to learn that I've kept off most of the weight that I lost during treatment (I'm down 36 pounds from my treatment start). Evidently this is <i>not</i> the case with the majority of her overweight patients. She said most overweight patients either don't lose weight or lose it and pack it right back on afterwards. 

Her observation, which I found a little odd, but not unpleasant, was: ""You must have been extremely determined to get through the treatment with a positive mindset."" 

Well ... yes. Yes I was. 

And still am."

"event","There are days, like today, where I sometimes wonder if perhaps 48 weeks of interferon/ribavirin therapy have left a cognitive footprint of some kind.

On my ""bad"" days (such as today), I can't focus, can't multitask, have a terrible time with problem-solving. In fact, it feels much like some of my ""mildly bad"" chemo days. On the other hand, my last interferon injection was over <i>six months</i> ago.

I'm trying to decide if perhaps I'm just being a baby because I'm not getting enough sleep, or if this is something real that I need to discuss with my doctor. 

Perhaps this is normal; my study hepatologist did warn me that it's not unusual for some people to take as long as 6 to 12 months to detoxify.

Still, this is an unpleasant set of thoughts. 

When I can actually remember them, that is."

"event","First, thank you to everyone for your supportive comments; I didn't acknowledge everyone individually, but please accept a one-to-many group hug from me now.

Some answers to some questions people have dropped me, both directly and in LJ and Facebook comments:


<b><i>Why is your ending viral count higher than your starting count?</i></b> My hepatologist says this is a not uncommon reaction; the virus has been prohibited from replicating for a year, so when it gets the chance to finally replicate, it kicks into high gear. Her guess is that it'll ""calm down"" to around the same count as my pre-treatment measurement.


<i><b>Can you get back on treatment right away?</b></i> No, my body still needs at least another six months to recover from the last treatment.


<i><b>Are there any treatment alternatives?</b></i> Yes, but not right now. The alternatives at present include:

1. Repeating conventional treatment (Pegylated interferon injected once weekly, 1200mg of Ribavirin daily) in six months to a year, on my own, and not as part of a study. I'm <i>guessing</i> I'd probably have to go for a 72 week treatment cycle, since 48 weeks hasn't worked. If I chose this option, I'd start somewhere between July 2009 and July 2010.

2. Going into a study for one of several experimental drugs. This would be tricky; I need to find a study that's (a) taking in patients when I'm ready, (b) looking for patients who have failed conventional treatment (as opposed to ""treatment-naive"" first-timers), and (c) operating in the San Francisco Bay Area. I was uncommonly fortunate to happen to hit all of the criteria for the study I just completed at UCSF. Again, I'd start looking for a study entry somewhere between July 2009 and July 2010.

3. Waiting until 2010, when a number of drugs in the pipeline are scheduled to hit. (Click <a href=""http://www.hcvadvocate.org/hepatitis/hepC/HCVDrugs.html"" target=""_blank"">here</a> for a list of what's in the development pipeline at present.) 


<i><b>What do you think is the most likely alternative?</b></i>  Probably waiting until 2010. I don't have any objection to restarting treatment, <i>except</i> I'd first like some time to rebuild my life a little, and time to get into better shape. There's a rough but discernible correlation between obesity and (lack of) treatment results. 


<i><b>How do you feel about all of this?</b></i> I thought I would feel horribly depressed, but actually, I'm just vaguely sad and terribly disappointed. I was warned up front that my chances of successfully clearing the virus on the first treatment were very low. I just happened to get further along in the process than either my doctors or I originally anticipated.


<i><b>How is R. handling this news?</b></i> He shares my disappointment, as you might expect, but is otherwise being very supportive. We both pointed out to each other - nearly simultaneously - that at least now we both know what to expect for the next treatment cycle.


<i><b>What are your next steps?</b></i>

1. Go to my local HCV support group - which happens to be meeting tomorrow, so it's good timing.
2. Make an appointment to see my (non-study) hepatologist to discuss in detail my treatment options.
3. Spend more time dancing - square and contra - and going back to the gym on a regular basis.
4. Not joining any wine tasting societies for the present."

"event","My study hepatologist just called. 

<lj-cut text=""Fuck."">She told me what I'd already suspected, since it had taken her longer than I'd thought it should to report on my last bloodwork.

The treatment was unsuccessful. 

At week 12, my HCV viral count was/is 1.6 million. Thi is slightly higher than my pre-treatment count of 1.5 million.

She's probably more stunned than I am. According to her, my treatment and response was one of the best she'd ever witnessed ... and she made the lab repeat the test to make certain.

So I did everything right, but just happened to be in the statistically small group who have a virus ""bounce back"" 12 weeks post treatment.

She's dictating a report to my regular hepatologist, who I'll go see in a couple of weeks to figure out what to do next.

Good thing I refused to make plans for an end-of-treatment party until I had the last test result.

Guess I'm back to feeling like a leper for a while.

Fuck.

If this draw (week 60) shows no detectable HCV RNA, then Dr. T. said she'll consider me &quot;cleared&quot;.

"event","<font size=""1"">Note: If you' re reading both this and my regular blog ... this entry is&nbsp;a summary of several other entries in my regular blog.<br /><br /><font size=""2"">I've written about some of the weird side effects during treatment, but recently I've run into an even weirder side effect post-treatment.<br /><br />I appear to be going through a second puberty. This includes [male] hormonal surges. I'm not having emotional swings, but I <em>am</em> incredibly horny at all times.&nbsp;<br /><br />One possibility which just occurred to me is that I've been taking Welbutrin for depression (and to counteract the more serious mental issues accompanying HCV treatment, which pleased my hepatologist very much).&nbsp;<br /><br />Hm. One of the possible side effects of Welbutrin which I was experiencing pre-treatment was increased libido. I wonder if this means my body has dumped whatever was impeding the Welbutrin side effect?<br /><br />Oh yes, I'm also fighting off a mild case of acne ... at age 47. The oil glands in my skin have gone absolutely bonkers. I wrote about this a few days ago, in <a href=""http://hepatitis-c-log.livejournal.com/27230.html"">this entry</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />My skin is slowly calming down, but my horniness is continuous.&nbsp;<br /><br />This has caused some embarrassing moments at work. I was at a client meeting when I realized I was suddenly (painfully and firmly, if you catch my drift) aroused. Good thing I was sitting at an opaque table. The arousal subsided shortly thereafter. <br /><br />Perhaps I need to consider carrying a textbook around in front of my crotch all day.&nbsp;<br /><br /></font></font>"

"event","My body, that is. Still detoxing. 

Thursday night was pretty awful. My sinuses kept filling up to the point where even using a CPAP, I had sleep apnea events for the first couple of hours. I felt like I had a fever, my pillow was soaked through in the morning ... and I felt just as hungover as I would the morning after an interferon injection. Weird.

Fortunately, the day got better, including a great massage from my favorite massage therapist, who did more than his fair share of energy work to get stuff moving around again. Despite feeling a little dizzy for the rest of the afternoon, I still felt substantially better than I did when I got up."

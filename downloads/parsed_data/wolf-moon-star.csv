"event","<P>I did a quiz on quizilla.com. This topic was:<STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>What kind of kiss are you?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>&nbsp;Results:</P>
<P>&nbsp;You have a mysterious kiss. Your partner never knows what you're going to come up with next; this creates great excitement and arousal never knowing what to expect. And it's sure to end in a kiss as great as your mystery.</P>
<P>&nbsp;(WOW,I did not expect that, but don't mind either!_!)</P>

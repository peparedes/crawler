It's been an awful long time since my last post. Hmm. It's a new year. What are the important bits?

Dictator of a Uni Club (win). 
Still single (grumble).
Turned 22 (yay!).
Another graduate diploma (what real world?).
Long bout of depression (suck).
Finally rediscovering myself and my self-worth (double win).
Still no job (oops).
Huge fuck off earthquake (but we've all heard ENOUGH about that).
Harry Potter 7.1 and 7.2 (noooooooooo end of an era).

I think that's about it, thus far."

"event","Well.

Um.

It's been a while.

A long while. So much as changed. And while it seems weird to put my life's events up here when the few people who read this already know it, I'm going to be a good little Internet Emo and do so anyway. 

Where do we start?

Living at home, not flatting. Much easier on the budget and stress levels. 

Studying journalism post-grad via correspondance with Massey Univeristy. Very bad for stress levels, grades are hard to get and not going to well.

New boy. Luke and I didn't end up working and we split at the end of January. Too much stress, too much pain. We couldn't give one another what we really needed. Since then, though, we've patched up our friendship - which is something I'm really pleased about. And my new boy, Tim,&nbsp; is currently sitting on the floor at the end of my bed playing Star Wars Jedi Academy on Xbox. Win. It will be three months on the thirteenth. (And he plays card games!).

No job. Cafe was sold, I was not needed by the new owners. :( Oh well. Am going to take a bit of a break for a while - I haven't been out of a job a week yet. So having time to myself, and time to spend on Tim, will be lovely. I really do love him a lot.

Er, I think that's it? Another show - Jesus Christ Superstar - has come and gone, was a blast.

Need to find direction in life, I feel."

Police pulled his body out of the Heathcote River at about 9am. He was walking home from a party the night before, I guess he slipped or fell in the dark and drowned.

I've known him for years, he went through school with me and was good mates with a lot of my friends. He wasn't one of my best friends, but I did consider him a mate. 

He was a good guy. He didn't deserve this."

"event","Quote of the night: &quot;I'll update when stuff starts again.&quot; (Merryn)

Weeeeeell...stuff. Yes. Things have been a-happening. 

Like, I've moved out. Into Luke's flat, no less. And no, we haven't moved in together. I've just become a flatmate of his. There is a difference, people! We are flatties ... although I will admit that he hasn't spent a night sleeping in his OWN room for over a week. But this is because of the tannery night shifts: when he gets home, my room is darker and cooler because it gets the sun in the afternoon and not the morning, like his room does. Hence, my room allows him to get better sleep. And I get a boything for a few hours before I get up. But it's great living here, with Merryn too. We're having a blast, and no flat conflicts!

There was that tme about a week and a half ago...yeah. Glandular fever and strep throat at once. Enter stage left: week'o'hell. Gah. Haven't ever felt that bad before. My throat was so swollen I could hardly swallow...terrible. But it's passed now. Mostly - the throat's gone, but the GF is still lurking (like tonight, when I almost fainted at work. Again).

Christmas was good (lots of flat gifts). And Luke stayed both Christmas Eve and Christmas Night, which was lovely. Also lovely was NY! The first KAOS NY I've been too, and it was awesome. I don't think I've ever danced so much. And it was so nice to have a night to cut loose and just ... let go. Was such a relief.

Mmmmm...Luke's at the tannery again tonight. Another three or four weeks of this...he'll crawl into bed around 8.30am tomorrow morning and sleep until about two or three. He's such a sweetie - I've been leaving him notes on my little whiteboard, and On the nights I work (and get home after he's left for the tannery) I find he's left them for me, too. Tonight's was very sweet; he's such an angel. I wish there was something I could do for him to show him how much I really love him. Unfortunatly, the word hasn't been invented yet.

I'm such a romantic. And proud of it, too."

6 - 9 rehearsals on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. 7 - 10 on Wednesday. And 1 - 5 (usual class time) on Friday. Christ, it's hard work. On the plus side, I'm on stilts for this production. 

On another plus side, the weather seems to be improving and sun makes me happy. So does Luke, but that's just obvious. This weekend was awesome: pirate party saturday night and a the KAOS spring picnic on sunday. Much awesomeness."

What if I died in my sleep tonight?&nbsp;<br /><br />Would I regret anything? Hm. I don't think so. Well, nothing major. I'd regret that I'd never been out of the country and never seen the pyramids and Rome, and that I never finished my degree. And that I'd miss the <em>Clone Wars</em> movie and playing <em>The Force Unleashed.</em> And I haven't finished watching <em>Firefly</em>.&nbsp;Or finshed those fanfics...<br /><br />Aside from the material, superficial things, I can't think of anything. At such an early stage of my life I've already touched that which most people strive to find in their life. I have a loving family, a roof over my head and (relative) financial security, the little comforts of home and security. I have an amazing - and very mixed - group of mates, who range from people I met years ago to people I met last week. I have a loving and beautiful boyfriend, who I am still convinced is really just a hallucination and too good to be true.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've never been happier.<br /><br />I don't think I've anything left to say.

That's...hillarious.<br /><br />Star Wars, though, is god. Well, the Force is, technically. I still must get my hands on AotC and RotJ. And KotOR 2 is awesomness incarnite. Especially when one has used the glitch on Korriban to beocme stupidly strong and can now waste most enemies on one move...and is 100% evil. Heh, my avatar looks like I haven't slept in six months and have been on hard drugs for four...and that I've been dead for the past two weeks because of it. Grey and corpse-like, very evil. What the Dark Side does to the skin...<br /><br />Harry Potter is also god (I mean the series, not the actual character himself). Re-read the entire series, enjoyed every word, can't wait for Half-Blood Prince to get its sorry ass to theatre screens. It might be decent...it's directed by David Yates (who I will worship should I ge the chance). Speaking of which - DY is now directing Deathly Hallows, which will be split in two. There is a God.<br /><br />I've also re-discovered my love for Yugioh. What? Don't you dare look at me like that! Sure it's juvenile, and cheesy, and childish...but it's magic and cards, and fun! Must find the rest of the manga and re-read it. The censored American-ified TV show we get is pretty bad, true - but the manga is great. Very dark...<br /><br />Doctor Who is being replayed on TV. WOOT! My favourite season, no less. Because Rose is cooler than martha. martha doesn't even get capitals. That's how less cool she is.<br /><br />LOTR is the original love of mine, I think. I haven't seen the films in yonks (haven't ever said yonks for yonks either), must re-read book. Must bask in old-school glow which it produces. Must pretend I live in Middle Earth once more. Must feel warm fuzzies knowing NZ is ME, and being at work and looking at mountains imagining Hobbits and Orcs and Elves (oh my!) running all over...<br /><br />...ElfQuest. How long has it been since I read that?...years. At least. Must steal books of bestie before she flees back south...<br /><br />Wicked. Spring Awakening. We Will Rock You. Sweeney Todd. JC. Little Shop of Horrors. Moulin Rouge. Beauty and the Beast. Harispray. RENT... <em>Les Miserables</em>.<br /><br />Hours of joy contained on CDs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Drink with me, to days gone by<br />Sing with me, the songs we knew<br />At the shrine of friendship, raise your glass high<br />Let the wine of friendship never run dry<br />If I die, I die with you...</em><br /><br /><br />"

"event","Christ, I need a constant reminder I've got one of these.&nbsp;<br /><br />Soooooo...yeah. Life. That thing we're all going through at the moment.&nbsp;<br /><br />Uh, Uni...Uni's good. Over halfway through second semester. Taking fun (if hard and essay filled) courses, but DID get an A on a Theatre and FIlm project! WOOT!<br /><br />Got into the musical <em><u>Les Mis</u></em>, just as company, but all company has a solo of some kind, I'm told. First rehersal tomorrow..sweeeeeet. It's out of town, like an hour away, but still...IT'S LES MIS! Totally worth it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Star Wars is my total god at the moment. I've even given myself a Padawan braid. Had it for about three weeks if not somewhere around a month. I like it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Need somehting interesting to talk about.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hm.<br /><br />Random fact: Coruscant has had 22 battles in it's history. Which means the 'First Battle fo Coruscant' in Ep III is a fucking LIE! Stoopid writers...they thought we wouldn't notice.<br /><br />Oh yeah, that reminds me -&nbsp;I want to kill one of my lectuers. I thought everyone knew that you don't get Star Wars (or LOTR, for that matter. Or Harry Potter. Or Doctor Who) information wrong in front of me. Or I begin to plan your demise. Anyway, Lee, my American Film lecturer was talking baout Blaxplotation in the 70s, and how the blockbusters movies - like <u><em>Jaws</em></u> and the original <u><em>Star Wars</em></u> - made the big studios stop producing Blaxsploitation films 'cause they thought that the black community was just as likely to go to a <u><em>Star Wars</em></u> or <u><em>Jaws</em></u> sequal than it was a film made specifically for them. So Lee said that they started putting token black characters in the big movies...and I knew what was coming. Sure enough, Lee mentions Billy Dee Williams - Lando Calrissian - and says that he's on <u><em>Empire Strikes Back</em></u> and is a bad guy. My friend next to me had to restrain me.&nbsp;<br /><br />A) Lando is in <u><em>Empire Strikes Back</em></u> <strong>AND</strong> <em><u>Return of the Jedi</u></em>. BOTH, LEE, <strong>BOTH!</strong><br /><br />B) Lando is a good guy. Sure, In ESB he turns Leia, Han and Chewie over to Vader, but that's cause the Empire got to Colud City just before the Falcon and its crew, and had no choice. But he does make sure his city is warned about the Empire (and advises everyone to leave), and helps Leia and Chewie bust out of prison and escape. He's flying the Flacon at the end. In RotJ, he's joined the Rebellion, and is&nbsp;in Jabba's palace on Tatooine, disguised as a Bounty Hunter. Fuck, that's at major risk to his own life, especially if he get's caught (and then he's almost eaten by the Sarlacc). So he helps again there. But the major point is that he flies the Millennium Falcon in the Battle fo Endor. Hell, he <strong>leads</strong> the fucking attack. And it the one who is responsible for blowing the second Death Star up. Now, that clearly makes him good. Hell, Lee - you're lucky to be alive.<br /><br />Some people are just stupid.&nbsp;<br />Like Lee.<br />And George Bush.<br />And people who think they are 'gangstas'<br /><br />They should be given to the Ewoks. Then the Ewoks can sacrifice them or whatever and the world will be a better place. Or maybe we should let the Sith use them for fighing practice. Yeah, that one.<br />Cause that would be entertaining to watch. <br />"

I've seen some of the cast around. Steph's at uni, Ryan was in a Shakespeare competition I went to (and his team got through to the finals! Go them!) and I saw D' on campus, cause he was working in the theatre. They're all good. Ryan and D' are both missing Rent, Steph not so much because of all her uni work. As I write this, I'm watching Rent. That's how screwed up I am. 

Luke's back, he got into his course! He's gotta raise a shiteload of money (around 200,000k. That's NOT a typo), for living costs and the course itself, but he's happy. 

I miss them. Still it hurts.

(But I did get into the uni musical, so I have a new project)

"event","I'm currently suffering from RWS. Rent Withdrawal Syndrome. It's been a week since final night. Damn, it sucks to be me...

It went so well. So well. I miss the cast, all of them. 

I miss the company girls of my dressing room, and all the fun we had straightening hair and acting like idiots. Steph, Annie, Jo, Kat and Jess. Love you guys, hope everything's great in you lives. 

I miss the lead boys, who never did quite get the hang of cleaning their room at the end of the night. Don't leave costumes on the floor, Jeremy, I'm looking at you. Then there was Aaron, Leroi, Leon and Blackie. So talented, that bunch.

I miss the lead girls, whose small dressing room always seemed to be one of the social centres backstage. El, Hannah and Jane. Always full of life and passion, those three.

I miss the company boys, who always had lollies. Even if they were hidden in the piano that time. Dean (my rock), Ryan, D' (my saint) and Nic. Four great guys who were great to hang out with.

I miss doing warmups before we started the show each night, I miss the dancing and various antics that went on offstage while waiting for a que (*cough* CONTACT *cough*). I miss hanging out with this group of kick ass people and feeling like I was truly part of something amazing. I miss the adrenaline rush that onstge brings, I miss showing people that I can do something special. I miss the band - Max, Leroy, James, Jeff, Doogle. And Luke, our wonderful musical director! He's in NY at the moment. Good luck, Luke. I miss the crew, and the mic techs, and the soundchecks before warmup, peeking at the audience before the performance. The one moment of a song where the same thing happened every night, but it was always a comfort, almost - the same eye contact with a member of the cast, the same ass slap in La Vie Boheme (Jo, you know that's you...). I miss singing Seasons of Love and feeling warm and fuzzy onstage because I love the people I'm with and I want the audience to see that. I miss the elation that coming off stage at the end brings, and how we're all smiling. I miss hugging various cast members and feeling loved. I miss the support that was always there when I needed it. Whether it was a hug, a word, a smile, a hand squeeze, I miss it all. I miss seeing Pete, our awesome director, and my much loved bro-in-law, as he wanders backstage before the show and at half time, giving us words of encouragement. 

I miss the music. I miss the characters. Being pissed off in Rent, feeling the pain in Will I, having fun in La Vie Boheme. Feeling calm and relaxed in Seasons of Love, trying not to laugh onstage in Contact. Smiling right through the finale, thinking these are the people I live, this is what I want to do everyday. Perform. Give an audience a message. 

No day but today.
Measure in love.
Viva la vie Boheme.

I miss seeing the guy I love, who I fell for. Fell hard, but not fast, if you see what I mean. Just seeing him made me feel better, no matter how shit my day was. He knows I like him, but I don't know if he knows that I love him. Yes, that makes sense. I hope, for his sake, that it fades. I don't want to scare him away, I value his friendship too much. Even though I never see him, not anymore, not since Rent finished. I'll always love him, though, because I'll always love the cast. My family. My Rent family.

We created characters for ourselves. ""Give them a 'Rent'"" said Pete. ""Something that they fight against. And give them a 'Seasons of Love' - the thing which makes them get up every morning.""

The cast and crew are my Seasons of Love. No doubt. 

Miss you all. Love you all. Even though you don't know I have an LJ and aren't reading this. If you are, then good for you - I mean every word of this. 

No day but today."

"event","Whovian life has been continuing. Managed to watch a heap of Who in the past week...

The Mind Robber - Second Doc
Genisis of the Daleks - Fourth Doc
The Visitation - Fifth Doc
Vengance on Varos - Sixth Doc
Ghost Light - Seventh Doc

Plus a few random Tenth episodes, cause I've got the second series box set and can watch them whenever I like. 

Speaking of which, Tawa is proding me because she wants to watch some of season two. Mainly the Children in Need and Xmas Invasion. Fun fun fun.

Sure, I have a life...but I left it in the TARDIS.....

God knows if anyone's actually reading this crap besides Tawa. Oh well, I'll pretend others do read it...

So, my Xmas was great - Among cool stuff I got a Lightsaber - and not shitty plastic, I'm talking official merchandice/collectables. I got Mace Windu's, (Samuel L Jackson, if you don't know) and my dad got Vader's. They're so much fun to play with! 

New Year was cool - had a Dr Who marathon (and some horror movies) with some mates. Didn't sleep at all, pure devotion to the Doctor kept me awake. Bless.

RENT rehersals started on Jan 8th, all going well. Our season starts on the 22nd of Feb, so not long now. Our opening night is a concert for NZAF - the New Zealand Aids Foundation. Should be absoloutly wicked. 

Speaking of which, I've recently become obsessed with that. 'Wicked', I mean - the musical about the Wicked Witch of the West. Oh soooo soooo sooo cool. Killer soundtrack. Don't stop playing it.

'Romeo and Juliet' got finished, and I was amazed at it's reception. New one is now up, 8 chapters stong at the moment, called 'Let the Games Begin'. It's going well, and is well recieved.

ONLY A FEW WEEKS TILL UNIVERSITY STARTS!!!!"

Rent rehersals are over for the year, all my Xmas shopping is done and Doctor Who is back on TV. It's just re-runs of season one, but I'm not complaining.

Ho hum.

Romeo and Juliet got updated - the following is still strong. Yay!

I haven't seen the Ninth Doctor's season for about a year, and my Whovian mates didn't see them at all - so&nbsp;I got my hands on volumes one and two, the first six episodes, and have been watching. Man, it's so much fun! I had forgotten how cool they are.&nbsp;<br /><br />And I'm doing a Whofest on Friday night with Tawa, so that's gonna be great! Can't wait for her to meet Jack - we're getting the thried volume on Friday, too. Should be fun.<br /><br />For any fanfic readers, the next chapter of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is coming...<br /><br />Oh, and BBC.co.uk has got a great Doctor Who advent calender! So fun!"

In other news, FanFiction.net is letting me up upload documents! Yay - i can keep going with my current story! (It's Doctor Who - Rose and Tenth land on a planet of thespians and have to be involved in a performance of Romeo and Juliet to leave...guess who they have to be...) It's really nice - everyone seems to be really supportive of it, and all the reviews I'm getting are really good. Yay for self-esteem boosters!

AND...I've only got one more exam! But it's halfway through next week, so I'm taking it easy at the moment. Life, at current, is good (Except Tawa's got back problems. Tawa's my best mate).

And then there's rehersal to look forward to tonight. I'm involved in a production of RENT late Feb/early March next year, with Leap of Faith Productions. Rehersals are soooooooo much fun!!"

These fricking assessors need to get their heads out of their asses. Honestly, they're testing my friend and I on stuff we didn't even learn this year! Improvisation was taken out of the drama curriculum this year, but we're still tested on it. Fuckers.

I'm just praying I don't freeze in front of the camera tomorrow....if I do, I'm screwed. Meh. But it only takes, like, fifteen minutes to do - unlike the three hours some of my friends have to go through on their tests. AHHHHHHH...

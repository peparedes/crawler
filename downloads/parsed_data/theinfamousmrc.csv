As of right now most people are in their respective weddings eating or else where and what do I get.  I get the mother and grandmother of a small child who decide to change the child in the lobby ON THE COUCH. I mean what the fuck is wrong with you. God forbid this fucking half wit mother should have taken her poop machine into the bathroom and use the baby changing station. Why would anyone want to use one of those when you can get your babies piss and shit all over the couch in the lobby. I dont know whats worse, seeing the event take place or knowing that some customer is going to sit in that exact same spot."

"event","So Friday night after an uneventful night at the bar, i was cleaning up as usual and all i heard was a screech and a thud. naturally i went outside to see what happened and i could still see the smoke from the deployed airbags lingering in the air. So i wasn't the first one on the scene but i was one of the firsts. So the driver must have taken the turn at the intersection at about 30-50 MPH. She lost control of her car and hit the first 3 cars parked in the parking lot, across the street from the bar. after hitting the 3 cars she hit and took out the light post and stopped. The girl then got out of her car and RAN up the street away from the accident, leaving her friend in the car. Some drunk college kids pulled the kid out of the car and laid him on the sidewalk, while others were trying to get the horn to turn off. As the kid was laying on the ground bleeding the people who pulled him out of the car were fighting over who knew CPR, but he was still breathing making this not a necessary issue. I started pushing back the growing crowd, and telling them to get the hell out of the way because the paramedics were on the way. Naturally this didn't work as kids kept crowding around and taking pictures with their cells phones of this bleeding kid and the fucked up car. while i was pushing back the crowd i got a look at the kid and looked into his eyes.  Not only did he have not a clue wat was going on but i think he had an instant concussion. as far as i know this kid is doing ok, and the girl was still at large. that was on saturday.   

I cant explain how creepy it was to look into the eyes of someone who is literally GONE, and has no idea what's going on. I think it was almsot as if he thought he way dying, his eyes were scanning back and forth across the sveral faces looking at nothing in particular, but trying to make sense of it all, and for that one instant we locked eyes and connected. It was a haunting image for me to look upon and is one what is bured into my Mind and probably will be forever. Empty eyes searing back and fort seeing things we can only just begin to fathom. Wondering if everything is going to be ok or if in-fact this is it."

"event","Ok  So after living with a leaking toilet for alst few months i have to say the bathroom was discusting. My roommate whos inability to empty a full trash can led to a massive overflow of toilet paper filled with snot, q-tips, and other things I can't even identify. Needless to say after a few weeks I was the one who finally broke down and cleaned it all up (with rubber gloves on of course) after several dry heaves i was able to clean up the rotting water soaked trash, and threw everthing including the trash can out. Now seeing as people can't seem to empty full trash cans and keep adding more and more crap to it i didnt buy a new trash can. So now instead of walking to the Kitchen to throw thigns out my Roommate Flushes them down the TOILET, WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT.  so after a toiletbowl full of q-tips cloged the pipes i had to go buy a plunger, which isnt so bad since i needed one anyways but man the mother fucker costs 10 bucks, but trust me when it comes to the toilet and plungers you can't afford to go cheap. needless to say the war of whats acceptible to flush down the toilet must insue, becasue if its not stopped i wont be suprised to find a god damn beer bottle in it, or come home to a fucking Lake"

"event","Well where to start other then it's WEEK 4, and you all know what that means. This weeks candidate managed to spray his Douchiness, not only all over me, but also to cote the restaurant where I was eating in the fine distinct oder of April Mist. Mr Douche bag of the week 4, was sitting at the booth across the wall divide from me. While eating my dinner I had the prestigious honor of hearing him Scream about how his friends Martini should not be garnished with a lime. ""Hey buddy."" he said to his latino waiter, "" Tell your bartender that a martini should never come with a lime"". Now call me crazy but a High end bar like Pedro's Mexican Restaurant, should know better, right? I mean this is after all, Pedro's Mexican Restaurant, where the most popular drink on the menu is a Margarita, Which is coincidentally garnished with a LIME, and well the most popular beer is Carona and well that comes with a lime too. After the lime fiasco, this douche then begins to talk with his latino waiter about his trip to mexico, and how he loved being in Cancun, which I'm sure our latino friend could give to shits about because its the Wisconsin Dells of Mexico. Now call me crazy but someone who's been to Mexico, and loved it should know the difference between an enchilada, and a burrito, thus bringing us to round 3 of douching.  After listening to this stimulating conversation about the finer points of mexican cuisine, Douche Bag decided he wants to eat a taco, THANK GOD THEY NEVER ASKED IF HE WANTED HARD OR SOFT SHELL. After deliberating about the price of a single taco versus the platter of 3, which is they way they are served, he orders the fucking 3lb burrito. Needless to say, the only thing this guy is good for is figuring out to the exact cent what 15% of your total bill is.        This post is for you MR. Douche, who proves that in life some people can squeeze a quarter into 75 cents, but most of us just don't give a FUCK."

This ones goes out to all you Super Fags out there, you know who you are. The ones with the Super Lisp, the Super Swish, and Super Hags. Yes you Super Fags are the DOUCHE BAGS OF THE WEEK. I would personally like to thank you for re-enforcing the gay stereotype in the minds of everyone. While proving that every entrance you make, even in the fucking bathroom, has to be grand and some big production. It's you Super Fags that piss us all off. Whether your carrying a purse, or bitching about a hang-nail, nothing is ever trivial to you. Thank you for making the simplest tasks mountain size, for where else on Earth can I get an in-depth look at why you refuse to date someone because they wear Tommy and you think that was SOOOOO 3 years ago. You Super Fags are the DOUCHE BAGS OF THE WEEK, because while pissing me off on a day to day basis, I just can't get over the fact that you have to bitch, and bitch, AND BITCH, about something important, like how it's important to be tan during winter. So lets here it for the Super Fags, and their Super Hags who keep this world revolving on the important issues of life."

Well after serving more than 4+ years in my personal tour of customer service HELL, I've hit the pinnacle of my career. I've been pushed to the breaking point by some old crotchety bitch. Midway through my 8 hour shift today, after spending all morning whoring my self out shamelessly to self righteous soccer moms, this old granny has the balls to come up and yell at me because she can't get into her room at 2:30p, even though check in isn't officially until 4:00p, which by the way she knows. *insert condescending look here*  After suffering an all out verbal assault by a senior citizen about how it's not fair that her room isn't clean and other people's are, how she has this wedding that she needs to attend, and must AT ALL COSTS HAVE A ROOM TO CHANGE IN. She continues to berate me in front of a lobby full of people. I took the assault, and told her that housekeeping has an order to how the clean the rooms, and that I could get a rush on her room but it would still be a good 30 min to get it clean. *This pushed her over the ledge* So it get to the point where her husband is telling her to calm down and that ""It's not like he can go clean a room for us right now"" and she says ""Well HE'S the one I can deal with right now and I'M dealing with HIM"" the husband looks me in the eye and says to wifey "" Honey I wouldn't want to make him angry look at him"" she says "" I don't care How big he is I WANT MY ROOM""  now naturally I was seeing red. And well lady since I couldn't tell you to FUCK OFF to your face, I'm giving you a big ol' FUCK OFF right here. YOU MA'AM are the DOUCHE BAG OF THE WEEK! YOU MA'AM are the worthless piece of shit that bitterly clings to life sucking as much as you can out of the rest of us. YOU MA'AM are the BITCH that screams for the senior citizen discount on the weekend so you can get a cheaper room, which you will pay for with your SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK, THAT ME WORKING ALLOWS YOU TO GET EVERY MONTH! YOU MA'AM, quite frankly, are the PIECE OF SHIT, that won't go down the toilet on the FIRST FLUSH!!!!! YOU MA'AM are the DOUCHE BAG Of the week, for which i have to give you props, because after 4+ years in hell, you are the first motherfucker that has ever made me want to scream FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKK  YYYYYYYOOOOOOOUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Once a week i will be giving away my Douche Bag of the Week Award and my first award goes to 2 yes 2 little punks who came into the bar i work at with the same shirt (only the color of the stripes was different) same style of pants, and same pair of white shoes. IF thats not enough then these kids started to smoke their swisher sweets, and sing along word for word, bouncing back and forth, to Lil John.  my first DOUCHE BAG OF THE WEEK AWARD goes to you. Proving that even while dressing bad, acting tough while smoking Swisher Sweets, and being the whitest motherfuckers in the bar to be singing Lil John, you can still get girls to be all over you."

I say dont fix it, don't rebuild it leave it as a testament to those who were/are stupid enough to live in a city that is below sea level. You stupid fucks you deserved it, so tell me why do I have to pay for you to fix it. WHY DOES MONEY HAVE TO COME FROM ME TO FIX A CITY I COULD GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT. I'm a poor college student who works 2 jobs, lives below the poverty line, and is buried beneath so much debt I can't even see the fucking sun from underneath it all.  SO I ask you WHERE IS MY handout, where is MY free money, where is MY assistance to just make it in this world. Or maybe I'm asking the wrong questions.  WHY do we shell out hundreds of millions of dollars of AID to these people at the expense of my tuition spiking through the fucking roof. Sure I'm in college, sure I'm going to get a job, sure I might make it further then most people, but do those other's I'm going to be better then have to pay off thousands of dollars of loans at (i'm sure when i'm done with school) 23% interest rates. I MEAN C'MON PEOPLE all this money is coming from somewhere and it sure the hell isnt the pocket of the president, the senators, the representatives, the rich, or the famous. ITS COMING FROM US the working slags who are stupid enough to blindly follow, and not ask any fucking questions, like cows to the slaughter we go.  If these statements make me anti-government then so be it as of right now i'm anti-government, and i challenge you people in power to silence me, as a matter of fact i DARE YOU TO SILENCE THIS!  I've had enough of the people who run this country claiming to act in the best interest of us all, right you who make 250k a year can really relate to the 60% of americans living under 50k a year we have so much in common that it's un-fucking believable. SO remember when this country has the ground drop for under it and we fall harder and further then the old soviet union remember I told you it was coming!!!!!!!"

SO where to start nothing really new is going on with me, i just keep trucking along on this rather unstable thing called life except now i've managed to get a passenger/driver to help me out my bf, JEFF. What can i say other then i'm glad i was able to land him he's been a great factor in my ability to stop spining my head  wildly around and has managed to take it from 300rpm's to about 150, so over all i'm begining to focus on things that matter more, lol maybe finally i'll get on top of all my shit and actually contribute to society rather then sit back on mock it. Which, regardless of wheather or not i do get my head on straight, i will continue to do. In other news my old band that i used to be the front man and guitarest for has completed their recording process and is putting the final touches on their cd, of which im suprised to learn they kept a lot of the old songs i coliborated with them on, so i do expect 2% of the sales. (wink wink)SILENCE!! ummmmm so i hope this keeps a few of you interested in me know that i have not died and im still here, i'm trying to think of something inspiring to say, but alas i have nothing well i guess i could leave you all with a new joke that i wrote/thought up, for my inspiring comedian career, that is quite offensive but funny.         SO i'm sick of going down on girls all the time, always insistant that you eat them out before they even think or returning the oral sex favor, so needless to say after a nice sushi buffet you demand them to returnt he favor except they protest and thats when you hit them and say "" listen you little bitch as long as i'm baby sitting i'm in charge""   see now isnt that funny.    so to end this rant i leave you with these words of wisdom !!!!YOU MUST GO SEE THE MOVIE SERENITY AND YOU MUST LISTEN TO COHEED AND CAMBRIA!!!!!!"

Your birth on the 27th day of the month (9 energy) adds a tone of selflessness and humanitarianism to your life path. 
Certainly, you are one who can work very well with people, but at the same time you need a good bit of time to be by yourself to rest and meditate. 
There is a very humanistic and philanthropic approach in most of things that you do. 

This birthday helps you be broadminded, tolerant, generous and very cooperative. 
You are the type of person who uses persuasion rather than force to achieve your ends.
You tend to be very sensitive to others' needs and feelings, and you able to give much in the way of friendship without expecting a lot in return.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatdoesyourbirthdatemeanquiz/"">What Does Your Birth Date Mean?</a></div>"

"event","Well where to start this is also an update for my human conflict class. Well after our discussion about passive aggressive people.  I tend to see myself as someone who is open and direct with my feelings regarding a situation but I find when I deal with people who are passive aggressive that I also resort to using passive aggressive tactics. I do have to say I do hate it when people play those games with me because its clear avoidance of stating what the problem/issue is. I like people to be open and direct with me not hint at what the problem might be, because they eventually resort to well what do you think it is, and when you guess wrong you are in even more shit then you were before.  I come from a family that is open and direct and we deal with problems and issues head on, we yell, fight, scream, and then cool off and eat dinner. I think being more direct about your problems instead of being passive aggressive about it leaves the people in the confrontation in a much better place. Everyone knows where they stand, and the lines are cut and clear, there is no gray area, and the discussion is done, there is no re-opening of the wound so to speak."

If you didnt know already  my ex.  joe has moved to FLordia, i'm glad i got to see him one last time before he left and although i was feeling shitty aout that fact that he has finally left my life, i think im doing a lot better. i had my moment to cry and i'm all good now. i think its better for the both of us so we can move on you know let more of the wounds heal. i wish him the best and everything else, god knows he deserves it. I on the other hand am getting my ass kicked by this city i still only have my one part time job and maybe jsut maybe i'll land this job as a bouncer, which pays in cash at the end of the night, so maybe then i wont be as hard up for cash, GOD KNOWS I'M GETTING SICK OF RAMEN. well not much more to say here except well keep in touch you bitches.

Not only is this now going to be a place for my journal which i will be using for one of my classes. well for starters i guess i dont know what to write about other then we discussed a little bit about road rage. now i know i have road rage issues because i have road rage even when im waiting int eh drive-through for a fast food joint. i mean its a huge pain in the ass to drive up only to find a mini van stuck in front of you. and you know this van is full of kids and its going to take at least 5 min for them all to order food and if all you want is a soda, the rage starts to build. so i know i have road rage because when said mini van pulls around to the first window, and after i'm done placing my order, sometimes i want to take that turn at 30mph and rear end that mini van and get that soccer mom off to practice."

You're smart, witty, trustworthy, level-headed and industrious. 

You value your independance above all else. Success is very important to you. You give the impression that you may be a little jaded, but you still harbour school-girl fantasies of finding someone who'll make you giggle and blush. 

You can also be almost irrationally compulsive at times and are excessively cynical. Structure, order and schedual are very important to you. You have no tolerance for the majority of men these days. You find their behaviour completely unfathomable, and feel that if a man's over thirty and single, there's something wrong with him. It's Darwinian. They're being weeded out from propagating the species. 

Miranda quotes: 
""I know you're probably busy having mind-blowing sex, but I feel you need to know that your good friend, Miranda Hobbes, has just taken a piece of cake out of the garbage and eaten it. You'll probably need this information when you check me into the ""Betty Crocker Clinic."" 

""I used to masturbate to a busboy who was rude to me once. What do you think that means?"" 

""Men are so concerned about their balls. Women don't care. We care about nice arms, great eyes, a big dick...I've never once heard a woman say: ""He had such a big full scrotum."""

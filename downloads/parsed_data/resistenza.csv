"event","i dont even know what to say, yet i have so much on my mind. all these thoughts are circling around in my head, annoying the hell out of me like a gnat at a barbeque. ok that last part was from bad boys 2. speaking of that, just saw it tonight for the first time. i liked it. 

hmm.. i feel so... so.. uh shitty today? no thats not the right word. well i do feel shitty, but its not how i feel at this very moment. i know what i am thinking and i know what i am feeling, but i dont know how to put it into words. its probably best that i dont anyway as this could turn into a novel. 

today i received a page from my father telling me i never talk to my mom or my sister. my sister goes running to daddy because i dont reply to her. if only she fucking knew. if i did to her what she did to me, she would feel the same way. but whatever. i emailed her today so hopefully that'll make her happy. 

i have sort of been put into an awkward situation between a mother and her child, who is also or once was a good friend of mine. ive known her for years. ive lived with her. but for the last 3 months our friendship has been dead. so dead that the only time we ever talk is if i go over to her place. and that's once every few weeks. i dont know what to make of it, because i have tried talking to her to see what's wrong. but she has the nerve to tell me to my face, ""oh nothing is wrong. everything is just fine."" when we both KNOW its not. i love that girl, but i cant fight for her anymore. her mom asks me how she is and if i have heard from her. (she worries a lot) for the last 2 months i tell her oh she's doing great. same ol. but this week, i give up. i tell her mom, ""oh i havent seen your daughter in weeks. i dont know how she is, but knowing her, she is probably fine."" i told her that things havent been the same for months now and that i cant keep trying anymore because it doesnt feel like a two way street. she was understanding about it and asked if she should come to austin to see her because she thought she was doing drugs. i refuse to tell her mom anything about her life because it's not my place to do so, but i hate being put in the middle. so the question is, what do i do? 

one of my friends got into a car accident last night. he totaled his car, but im glad he's ok. i feel bad for him though cause i know he loved that car so much and he had only had it for 3 months- a brand new subaru wrx. last night was all weird though. we (me and my roommates) wanted to go out somewhere, and mandi was to drive to and from there to practice so she can get her license next week. well the thing was i didnt want to go, but they begged me to tag along, so i did. the minute i hop into the backseat of archie's car, i suddenly decide i wasnt feeling too hot and was uncomfortable. i considered getting out before we took off, but decided against that. archie was driving, so i figured he was just driving for a bit, then letting mandi take over. i wasnt feeling well at all as i had this somewhat nervous unsettling feeling in my stomach, and i was telling myself that when mandi and archie switch to drive, that im going to sit up and buckle up (since i was laying down in the backseat) we were on our way home going down on 35, but saw an ambulance drive by on the other side of the freeway. saw workers with lights everywhere cleaning up a portion of 35. and then when we get home, i get online.. he im's me ""i totaled my car."" turns out what we saw on 35 likely was his wreck site.

oh and today. i was on my way to pinnacle for my photography class. this dumbass in a brand new camry changes lanes on me and doesnt realize im in her blind spot. the lady got so close to me it nearly drove me off the shoulder. but honking did the trick and she went back into her lane. you know how when you experience a close-call on the road that you get this rush that shoots throughout your body and it gets all tensed up... well i had that for a second or two and it went away, but once i got to class that feeling came back, and ever since then, my whole body feels that way. as if i just almost crashed my car 2.583729 seconds ago. its been about 9 hours since that happened and it's starting to kind of hurt now. i want that feeling out of my body.

it is 4 49 in the morning and i am still up. i dont know why i cant just close my eyes and fall asleep. soon though. 

my whole body aches. maybe im getting sick. which would explain why i feel so shitty today? 

eh. 

im out.

FigureMeIfYouCan: i know it is lot easier to forgive an enemy than those that mean a lot to us.

FigureMeIfYouCan: they are doing it in a way to say the truth
FigureMeIfYouCan: they dont know any other better way to tell the truth.
FigureMeIfYouCan: when you put up so much lies, you will prone to feel the urge to say something truthfully.
FigureMeIfYouCan: we all know truth has its consequence...
FigureMeIfYouCan: it doesnt always result in our favor...
FigureMeIfYouCan: so obviously, you have been underestimated
FigureMeIfYouCan: because they may have thought you couldnt handle the truth in first place.
rainxen: then i guess my ""friends"" dont know me
FigureMeIfYouCan: they were once ur strangers.
FigureMeIfYouCan: they do know you, but not in a sense where they would know ur feelings.
rainxen: and if uve been friends for years?

rainxen: yeah
rainxen: i have it
FigureMeIfYouCan: read it please.
rainxen: i just did
FigureMeIfYouCan: hmm
FigureMeIfYouCan: we can all spend years and years to say ""hey, i know this person.""
FigureMeIfYouCan: but that ""hey, i know this person"" is not equivalent to ""hey, i understand this person""

FigureMeIfYouCan: *person
FigureMeIfYouCan: it takes more than ""good times"" together
FigureMeIfYouCan: or anything of such
FigureMeIfYouCan: it takes patience...
FigureMeIfYouCan: it takes arguments that lead to solution and conculsion
FigureMeIfYouCan: and it takes admiration and respect
FigureMeIfYouCan: to finally understand a person.
rainxen: why cant more people be like you?
FigureMeIfYouCan: obviously they dont share the same passion for philosophjy as i do :-D
rainxen: not just philosophy but a passion for life

FigureMeIfYouCan: we all underestimate the ""truth"".
FigureMeIfYouCan: we all feel like we couldnt handle the truth

WHAT IS A FRIEND?

i leave this on my away message, and this is what i get from jermaine:

FigureMeIfYouCan: hmm....
FigureMeIfYouCan: sounds like u r having trouble defining a ""friend"" when you thought someone was a friend and yet betrayed you?

.hmm, precisely.  

and it's not just A friend. it's several of them. i feel like i have been continuously lied to and fucked over by some of my friends, and i want to know why.

if i did something to deserve that, then TELL ME what i did wrong, instead of hurting me. it hurts more to be lied to and fucked over than to be told the reason why. it might hurt to hear the truth, but id rather hear it from you than hear it from anyone else. grow some balls!

people really dont know me at all. i talk and act like i'm tough and that nothing hurts me. a few have even gone as far as to say that i have a cold heart. but that's on the outside. the truth: i'm a frickin watermellon. hard on the outside, but soft mush on the inside. im a lot more sensitive than you think i am and can be hurt quite easily... but dont fucking test me.

and to answer my own question- a friend is someone who:
-you trust
-is there for you when needed
-tells you what you need to hear
-is honest with you
-walks in when the rest of the world walks out
-parties with you and babysits your drunken ass
-and supports you.

i could go on.. but these seven will do. 

hm i just got back from eating at wanfu's (thank you for being open until 4am!) with mike and hayley. had some good talks with them. am off to bed and attempt to get some sleep. i should have no problem sleeping tonight as i took two painkillers not too long ago.

xxoo.

QOTD: a friend told me this in a letter once, and it shows EXACTLY how i feel: ""people underestimate me, maybe because of my look, maybe because of my sign, and i love that.  i love to give the impression that i'm an easy victim.  i love that people think i am uneducated just because i was educated differently- that way people come at me from different angles, misreading me, and i can see the whole thing developing from far away. i aint nobody's fool, believe that.  and i am going to keep doing it the way i always done it.  if you like it, great.  if you dont, then i never knew you anyway."""

(keep in mind i have divorced parents- since the age of 2.) he is going to probably cry when he sees it. as for my stepmom and andrea- i'll prob end up getting them something from urban outfitters. now that leaves.. nick, my mom, stepdad, and jeff. mom and stepdad- am gonna check up the antique stores on south congress, since theyre antique freaks. nick, i have no idea what to get him.. he's HARD to shop for. jeff.. same. well hopefully i ll get as much done today as possible. am going to go and get ready to shop, so im outtie.

"event","am in houston at the moment and babysitting my little brother while the parents are vacationing away in jamaica, although he is at a sleepover tonight. im supposed to be finishing up my philosophy paper thats due tomorrow, but i really do not feel like reading and writing philosophy at the moment. a lot of things are on my mind anyway. might as well do this to kill some time while im waiting on the laundry to finish. 

LOOKING BACK- 

this year has been one long interesting year. i dont even know where to begin...

i have come a long way, this i know for sure. i started off the year by living with 2 friends for a while. got to know them more.. you know how some people are only meant to be friends and not roommates? this was it. we sprobably houldnt have been roommates, because it changed how we saw each other. sure was an interesting 2-3 months, though. as much as things have changed between me and them, it's not something that i regret.

then from april up until now, i moved back down south and lived with mandi. this, i must say, was a long, but definitely good and memorable ride-- and it still isnt over.  we have had our ups and downs, but i dont think i could ask for a better roommate than her. i dont think ill ever meet somebody as great as her when it comes to keeping relationships separate. we have our school relationship, roommate-ship?!, and friendship. whenever something isnt right about one of these, we dont let it affect the other two. we even went for a good 2 months or so where we were not really on talking terms, yet we did not let it interfere with anything else. *mandi- even though you and i had our moments, i still want to express my thanks. no need to further elaborate on this, as you and i had this convo not too long ago at barnes and noble. :) 

i have seen so many people come and go. at first i'd think it was unfortunate that the person left my life, but now that i think about it, it's not necessarily a bad thing. i believe that everything happens for a reason, and as i look back.. i can see that i have changed, and it is because of these people that i am who i am today. i believe that some people are meant to only come into your life for a certain period of time, teach you something, and then leave. this year, it seems, everyone came and went. my friends were like the seasons. we hung out at the beginning of a season, had our ride, and it ended. then all over again the next season with new people.

living in austin has definitely been an interesting experience. it wasn't what i thought it would be, but i am still more than happy to call it home since it's the place where i ""grew up."" and by growing up, i mean i had so much personal growth. this year was all about experimenting and discovering myself. throughout my journey, i have gone from a weak person to someone who's much more stronger and wiser. everything i have done up to this point in my life has changed me somehow, sometimes without me even realizing it until way later.

friendship-wise, i have had to learn the hard way that even your best friends may leave you. people you care about so much can screw you over, regardless of how close you are, or even THINK you are. i have learned that being selfish is not necessarily a bad thing and sometimes you got to put yourself first, before others. ive learned that sometimes the only person you can trust is yourself.    

relationship-wise, i have learned that all guys are not what they seem. hell, no one is. i have learned that men are NOT complicated..at all..like we women like to perceive them to be. i now know what types of guys i am interetsted in thanks to certain guys in the past. i have also noticed that as i get older, i have started to think more like a guy. and believe me, it is not such a bad thing after all. 

i have become so much more open-minded, and learned so much through my friends, my experiences, and i dont think i'm as pessimistic as i used to be. so, that's definitely a good thing. :) there have been so many times where i hated austin so much and wanted to leave. many people i have had bad encounters with, but instead of thinking of them as bad experiences, im thinking of them as learning experiences. i now know what to do next time if put into that situation again. 

living in austin- it has taught me that life is definitely way too short to be worrying about all the petty things.       

ah, im out.

xxoo.

"event","starting monday, august 2nd, 20004.... no more giving in to two certain things. 

can i go a month without it? mm yeah. lets go for fifty then.

today is day number 3. 

so, until the day of september 21st, i am not allowed to do those two certain things. oh boy, going to be a long 50 days, but i can do it. 

*confidence is key*

i will tune in every now and then to let you know how my progress is doing.

anyhoo.

school starts in about 2 weeks and i am extremely excited about it. i miss the campus scene, getting up to go to class, meeting people, and hanging with friends in between classes. my favorite part- my home is 1 light away from campus so i can go home for a minute if needed. i am hoping to land a job somewhere around here and hopefully it will be something that will work out well with my school schedule. i've had enough of slacking around and not getting anything done or feeling like i had a productive day, so am glad this semester will bring that. am going to be taking 5 classes this semester; here's how my schedule's going to look:

Mon and Wednesdays:
9:10-10:25a  - Yoga                         
10:35-11:50a - Trigonometry (ewww)          
12:00-1:15p  - Philosophy

Tues and Thursdays:
12:00-1:15p - Composition II
1:25-2:40p  - Texas History

next.

yesterday, my roommate left town for two weeks so starting today, i'm going to be working out everyday. its not that i dont feel like working out when she's here, but it will give me something to do everyday while she's gone. i also want to get back in shape and get toned up as i have laid around too much and became too ""soft."" also have got to get in shape for yoga, which i am absolutely looking forward to! i worked out for about a good thirty minutes today, but am going to be sore soon as i can feel my muscles shake. good feeling!! :)

well. got to run. 

qotd: EOFIOK!!!

pahahaha.... deaf people. just so hilarious. the ideas they come up with. the things they say they heard from this and that person. cracks me up that they cannot find anything better to do than to talk shit about other people, making them look bad, just so they feel better about themselves.

anyway, off point.

school started a couple of days ago and off to a good start so far. hopefully that'll stay that way for the rest of the summer. 

am hoping to land a job with motorola. it'll be similar to the job i held at dell, just with better hours and days. hopefully that will fare well. just gotta get my mama to send me my resume via email, and i'll be good to go. 

ah what else is new with me? hmm. things have been going good lately thanks to certain people in my life at the moment. am glad to have them here with me. 

anyway, im out. gotta finish up with school and then head out to meet with friends.

"event","omg.. new food obsession: toasted bread with peanut butter and grape jelly. so yummy- even got mandi and antonia to love it... yeah, pepe.

ahh, lately been eating so much grilled cheese sandwiches :D its pretty much all we have in our apartment. speaking of our apartment.. i am so in love with it. everything about it is great, all except for the fact we live right above this 80something year old woman who cannot walk up the stairs to let us know if we're too loud.. she's a sweetie though, but shit, pretty much we cant party at the apt without getting evicted haha. gonna be a long ass 9 months. other than that, it has been so great. im already at home here, even without my bed and my furniture. me and mandi always lounge around in the dining room once we wake up, laying down on the floor, literally just laying there and sometimes talking.. sometimes just enjoying the relaxation that our apartment provides.  if not in the dining room, we're plopped down on the airbed and doing the same thing. the thing is, our apt has sooo many windows facing the east and the sun shines at like 7am... so we both keep waking up over and over until like 11-12.. for some reason, keep waking up most morning/afternoons at exactly noon.  

life has been great lately.

been playing volleyball for last 2 days and loving it.

been working out with the yoga ball.. and shit, that thing WORKS.......... am sore.. and sore... all over.

will update more later... as i am off to go visit a friend then gonna go pick up mandi from work.

"event","mandi and i found an apartment that we both soo adore. its so cute. gonna fill out the paperwork tonight and then go back tomorrow, to see if we get approved and all of that mumbo jumbo. hopefully all works out well. 

anyway, it is spring break and so far nothing exciting happening yet. was supposed to go camping at pace bend with a bunch of friends yesterday, but ended up not going. will go tomorrow though, with a different group of friends. weather was quite nasty today, so hopefully tomorrow will be bright and sunny. 

right now i am broke like a motherfucker and it sucks. all of that will change soon though. i am supposed to have an interview next week at old navy. i hate that place, but hey, its a job. it will do. 

today we got our sorenson vrs phone installed, and i made my very first vrs call... ha. it was weird, but cool. i am definitely getting one of my own when mandi and i move into our new apartment- hopefully the one we want..... for some UNKNOWN reason, i have always loved the street name montopolis dr.   and guess what? our possibly future apartment-to-be is on montopolis dr. yayness. 

hmm, lately i have been missing a few certain people. theyre not in my life anymore and it makes me sad, but i know that throughout life friends will come and go... sucks that it has to be that way. i am just so glad and fortunate that i have had the opportunity to know these great people.  there was this one cute quote i saw one time... ""why can't we get all the people together in the world that we really like and then just stay together? i guess that wouldn't work. someone would leave. someone always leaves and then we have to say good-bye. i hate good-byes. i know what i need. i need more hellos.""  just so cute.  dont mean to sound kind of depressed, but im just feeling really blah right now. have had a long week. a really long one.

mom and dad are in italy right now and i am utterly jealous. italy is just so gorgeous and it just incredible. its so different from america. seeing the movie, under the tuscan sun, reminded me sooo much of italy. shows parts of tuscany, its hills, the little houses and cars.. words cannot describe how gorgeous it is. i completely recommend everyone to go at least once in their lifetime. anyway, while the 'rents are gone nick, andrea and i are taking turns babysitting ty. i went down to houston last weekend and had a pretty good visit, except for the parts where ty was all upset, blowing up, throwing things, hitting things.... the usual. he is so cute though- we went to lazer quest and had a good time, all until we received the scores...... second place, i got.... ty gets all mad and starts to cry a little bit. he got like 8th or 9th place, out of 11... so he can't really complain; he didnt get last place!! ha.. anyway, we played some games in the arcade.. big mistake. the basketball one ate up one of his quarters and he proceeds to kick the damn thing and gets reallllly upset. im like ty ty its ok.. i have more quarters.. and then he plays some shooting game, loses bad.. gets realllly aggravated.  then last game, driving game. ty and i versus one another. i beat him, but got like 6th place while he finished 7th..... this is what really killed the day. he got so upset because he kept on crashing over and over.... just sat there, buried his head on the steering wheel and cried like a 2 year old. stormed out of the place, and was just an asshole for the rest of the trip home. then he goes... im sorry i ruined your last day here (i was supposed to go home that day).  im like, its ok... and give him a little lecture about controlling his temper. 5 minutes later: tears on his face still, ""no, really, im sorry. i didnt mean to. im so sorry."" me: its ok, its ok..... dont worry about it.  ty: when are you leaving?   me: prob in like 2-3 hours... ty: *sob sob sob* me: whats wrong?   ty: i dont want you to leave. can you please stay til tomorrow?? please.  please..    me: i dont know, we'll see...

and end up, i stayed the night. that made ty happy. i love making him happy because i hate seeing him sad, mad, and upset.  just really wish mom and dad would look into getting something done about his behavior because no kind of discipline has helped..... we have even tried hypnosy (sp?)  imagine that.  its that bad.  

anyway, my ass is getting flatter from sitting here, so my ass is outtie.

will update later.

""if only i had never gone to the dtec party. if only i had never had to drive oscar home. if only i had said no in the first place. if only i had never smoked. if only i had never smoked at his house. if only i could control my excitedness and not have to tell somebody. so many if's. if. if. if. 
 
there's a what if to everything. 
 
but it's done with and nothing can be changed or taken back. you can't rewrite a chapter in the book of your life. you cant write a page, and decide to toss it in the trash and write a new one. it's done for. 
 
i hate it when he and i are on bad terms. i hate it when one of us or both are mad at one another. i just want it to go back to september and october where he and i were soooo :D all the time. i miss that feeling i get in my stomach when we talk to one another, especially when we talked about how much we liked each other. i miss having that smile on my face all the time. i miss finding myself smiling when im sitting at a red light and i think about something he said to me. i miss him emailing me. i miss him calling me boo and his snugglebug. i just wish the bad never had to happen. but i guess with the good, theres comes some bad. with the bad, there's always some good. 
 
earlier today i was reading my saved emails on the blackberry and there were 3 from eli.. i was just like :( because i never get emails like that anymore. 
 
all i want... is to be happy. why cant i ever have that? for so long i have allowed myself to be consumed with discontentment, only focusing on the crappy stuff rather than enjoying everything that i've been fortunate enough to be given. i need to try to have a more optimistic attitude towards life and everything in it.  for the longest time, my happiness has always been controlled by individuals- things they do and say, their emotions, feelings, reactions and even their mere presence (or lack-there-of) were determinants of my mood everyday. i have slowly come to realization that it is me and only me that can make myself happy. i still have to gain closure on numerous issues and i feel that once i do, i will be able to bask in the satisfaction of overcoming all of my personal obstacles.  
 
more tomorrow. 
 
what i need right now is sleep. but with so many thoughts running through my head, i dont see how i will. but i will try.

"event","Five tips for a woman ...
1. It is important that a man helps you around the house and has a job.
2. It is important that a man makes you laugh.
3. It is important to find a man you can count on and doesn't lie to you.
4. It is important that a man loves you and spoils you.
5. It is important that these four men don't know each other.

A Husband's Diary Entry ...
I never have quite figured out why the sexual urges of men and women differ so much. I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing. And I never figured out why men think with their head and women think with their heart. And I never yet have figured out how the sexual desire gene gets thrown into a state of turmoil when it hears the words ""I do."" One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed. Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, ""I don't feel like it. I just want you to hold me."" I said, ""WHAT???"" So she says the words that I and every husband on the planet dread. She explains that I must not be in tune with her emotional needs as a woman. I'm thinking, ""What was her first clue?"" I finally realize that nothing was going to happen that night, so I went to sleep. The very next day, we went shopping at a big, unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on three different, very expensive outfits. She could not decide which one to take, so I told her to take all three of them. She then tells me that she wants matching shoes worth $200.00 a pair to which I say OK. And then we go to the jewelry department where she gets a pair of diamond earrings.
Let me tell you. She was so excited. She must have thought that I was one wave short of a shipwreck, but I don't think she cared. I think she was testing me when she asked for a tennis bracelet because she does not even play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I told her that it was OK. She was almost sexually excited from all of this, and you should have see her face when she said, ""I'm ready to go to the cash register."" I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No, honey, I don't feel like buying all this stuff now."" You should have seen her face. It went completely blank. I then said, ""Really, honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while."" And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""You must not be in tune with my financial needs as a man.""
I figure that I won't be having sex again until some time after the spring of 2008."

"event","Consult not your fears but your hopes and dreams.

Think not about your frustrations, but about your unfulfilled potential. 

Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what is still possible for you to do. 

Forget about all the reasons why something may not work. You only need to find one good reason why it will. 

Others can stop you temporarily -- you are the only one who can do it permanently. 

Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace and gratitude. The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts. 

Until you are happy with who you are, you will never be happy with what you have.

If you can imagine it you can achieve it. If you can dream it, you can become it. 

Find arms that will hold you at your weakest, eyes that will see you at your ugliest and a heart that will love you at your worst.

Once you have found that, you have found TRUE LOVE!  

The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past. 

You can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches. 

You make me smile for no reason whatsoever, you make me laugh at the funniest things, but most of all you make me love you when I should not be loving you at all.

What's the sign that a person really loves you? It's not the things he gives you like flowers or kisses... it's the things the person doesn't give you... like tears in your eyes and pain in your heart. 

Love is not destroyed by a single failure or won by a single caress. It's a lifetime venture in which we are always learning, discovering and growing. 

Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence. When you experience love for the first time, real love, you live a  new life;one that you never knew existed before."

"event","yep, my thumb ring that ive worn since the summer after my freshman year... has broke. it's been cracked for a few weeks now, but today i noticed that it is no longer shaped like a (FULL) circle anymore. will need to get that fixed asap. 

i just got home today from austin. while driving down hwy 71, i got pulled over by a state trooper going the opposite direction... i was going 88, but luckily he let me go after i explained why i was in a hurry. see, it was my grandparent's 50th anniversary and the party started at 5:30. dad asked me to bring my camera and take pictures of the event, but i didn't have much time to haul ass to houston because my car wouldn't start. it's been doing that for the last few days - which i will get checked out on monday morning because i've got to get the oil changed at dad's office, do some work for him, and of course see whats up with my car. so once i finally got it to start, i left austin about almost 4pm. yep, so that left me about an hour and a half to get to houston when it takes a little over two hours. *knocks on wood* i need to stop speeding. 3 tickets in 7 months is too much. 87, 83, and 48mph.. jeez. i really love the thrill of driving fast though. i heard this quote one day by mario andretti... goes something along the lines of, ""if everything seems under control, you're just not driving fast enough."" 

haha anyway, i arrived at MY house at exactly 5:30, and rushed to get my camera bag and left to my grandparents... but it's a bit far. took me about 20-25 to get there, but i had to stop at the store to get some 400 film. i only had 100, 200, and scala.. so yeah, that took a couple minutes. arrived at my grandparent's house in tomball at just about 6pm. i walk in, and my aunt vicki - who was in the kitchen - says shhh sshh.. my grandparents were JUST about to start doing their vows to each other... it was sweet. i wish i could understand what they were saying though. it's like wow.. because they've been married for 50 years, and throughout those years, they had 4 children, and ehh... 12 grandchildren- i think? it was nice to see the familia again. saw some other people i hadnt seen in YEARS.... holy cow.. i saw anthony!! the last time i saw him... he was like.. not even 10! i think he was like 7 or so the last time i saw him.. and he's now 16 years old. all grown up. for a minute, i didn't recognize him, but after a few seconds of analyzing his face, i realized it was him. he's my aunt's (by marriage) brother's wife's son.... i think? also saw his little brother, and new sister that i never met. and this other guy donny and his son (i forgot his name?) whom ive not seen for maybe almost 10 years as well.  the last time i saw his son, he was a baby. and now he's just about tyler's age. all of my kiddie cousins are so tall and grown up.. it's scary. jessica is fucking taller than me!!!! and she's only like 15. she's gorgeous though. long long long blonde hair.  i was disappointed i didn't get to see katie. wasn't there... ohhh ya, celeste was SOOO adorable in her little pink dress. everybody was dressed up nice.. was kinda weird seeing all my little cousins all dressed up. after about 3 hours at the party, we left.  ty wanted to ride with me, so during the whole drive home, he was singing at the top of his lungs to every song on linkin park's meteora cd. he loves linkin park so much. used to always listen to their hybrid theory cd, but since nick got him the new one for christmas, now he listens to that one all the damn time. we had the music on pretty loud, so ty would ask me ""can you feel it?"" ""feel this.. feel this"" made me feel the vibrations on the armrest on my door. he was insane though, opening the window - hey, its like 40 degrees outside! but we compromised... by opening the moonroof bc the passenger window down was too fucking cold.  i need to see ty more often because its the only way he will sign. he doesn't have anybody to sign to or practice with so he starts to forget after a while.. practice makes perfect, i tell him. so when im around him, i make him practice. oooh - i gave ty a wedgie about 50 times during the party. why? because he kept on hitting me. i told him, each time you hit me.. you get a wedgie, period. so.. of course, he hits me.. wedgie.  hit, wedgie.  i think he LIKES it. :)   dad thinks so too. 

haha ok enough about the party. my week in austin was pretty good. was very different from the week before. i stayed at nick's apt and slept in mike's room since he was out of state on vacation in colorado with his family. comfy bed, i must say. me and ryan have hung out quite a lot. he's a really nice guy. it was the first time i had really met him. i met mike a while back when we went out to eat at bone daddy's, and had heard nick talk about ryan because of this girl they both liked, kayla... so i finally met him earlier this week. we went out to play pool one night - because he wanted to see if he could beat me. waiiiiit, i just realized something. i met ryan before! like a few weeks ago. mike, ryan, and i ate at double daves and played pool. me and ryan teamed against mike and crushed his ass. ok, now i remember. so correction- this was the 2nd time i met him.. but the first that i really hung out with him and got to know him. also went to a little houseparty with him and met up with nick. met this girl nick told me about with cankles. she didn't look like it, but i cant see. she had on jeans. the whole night, i was signing and signing. ryan and this other guy, chip were like in awe. chip- he is pretty good at understanding me- but im sure reading lips, not my signs. he is SO curious about sign language and always asks nick how to sign this and that. i love it when hearing people take interest in ASL and/or the deaf culture. hmm, lets see what else i did. ah yeah, i visisted meggie at her new apartment. it looks cute. pulled an all nighter and left her place at like 7am. man, i have got to STOP doing this. i seriously need to change my body clock. i am tired of staying up so late and getting up so late. wonder if that could be why im so tired and weak all the time? have got to start getting up early so i will be real tired and sleep earlier at night. hmm what else... went to acc and tried to get registered for classes, but could not because i had to take the compass test before i could register for classes. but by the time i got the results from the test, it would be too late to register. so, if i do end up moving to austin, my classes will be online because i am already registered for 4 classes at hcc. may add one more. dont know for sure yet. did not really do any job hunting because last week i actually started thinking... is austin where i really want to be? because now, im not so sure. i know it is where i want to end up living when i settle down and start my own family, but is it what i want right now? i dont know. dad's really pushing me to move. better job opportunities. better school opportunities. my friends are there. school in austin is out of the picture now though. still need that job. i have very little money to spend every month and am tired of it. honestly, i miss going to work and getting dirty everyday. i miss doing all the paperwork on the cars. i miss talking and having fun with some of my co-workers. i miss it.. because i quit. i shouldn't have. oh well. hmm, i also hung out with micha a little bit throughout the week. last night, went to tsd for the basketball games. that was weird! i havent been in seeger gym since homecoming of '02. been quite a while. saw ms fortney!! finally! saw ms deleonardis again. didnt get to see sean mcgrath :( i miss that fella. saw some other old tsd students.. met some new ones. oh ya, saw danieeeee!!! we had a long long good talk about a lot of things.. she is so grown up now. i am proud of her. she has done quite a bit of growing up over the last few years. she said to me that i sort of fill in lake's shoes when she's not around. i had to nag at her a little bit yesterday, because lake's not there to do it. she's gotta have someone to look out for her. hopefully lake will come to her senses and realize what she is doing. what lake is doing now, i think she will learn a lot from. i just hope she wakes up, sooner rather than later. after the game at tsd, we went to kelly and jacob's. danie wanted to join me with mike. we ended up drinking beer and playing card drinking games. learned a new game- egyptian war. love it already. after like an hour of playing or so, mike was like come here (outside to the patio) and when i open the back door.... guess who is sitting there? eli. 

i just took a look at him and walked back in the apt. i was actually kind of pissed, but at the same time surprised and happy to see him. im always happy to see him, but it pissed me off last night because we were smoking earlier and i was drinking. i dont like him seeing me drink or smoke. i dont like him seeing me high or drunk. after the last time he saw me stoned, i said to myself, he will never see me smoke again bc im never going to smoke in front of him again... and i got upset because he saw me. we talked alone for a little bit and then we took danie home cos she had to be home at two. we watched some televizzle and then went out to magnolia's cafe. i was still half mad, half happy with him. happy, because he's here with me. mad, because we didn't have the talk i wanted to have for the last two weeks. but the night ended good. got a goodnight kiss on my forehead. 

i am feeling a bit better now that we have talked some. that boy. uuugggghhh. he amazes me sometimes. the things he says. his bluntness. interesting conversation we had tonight. hmm, well it is now 5 minutes to 5 and i am done with typing. i have a lot of things on my mind, still, but i dont want to get into it and give everyone the benefit of knowing all of my thoughts at the moment. 

off to attempt to catch some sweet zzz's.

ahh, i am finally back in houston. spent a week in austin. was supposed to be looking for a job, but pratically bummed around during the day and then going out at night. did not get any job hunting done, but i did get an appointment with a temp agency this week. hey! little progress is better than no progress at all!! i will be going back to austin tomorrow after i go to HCC to get my college transcript, if they are even open. i need to register for school so fucking bad, because classes start at acc next week. hopefully, i'll be able to get into classes. if not, internet classes will have to do. i don't like them, but sometimes it's the last option. id rather be taking them online, than not taking any classes at all. 

this week in austin was very relaxing. again, i got to see some old friends - which is always good. finally got to see teara and spend some time with her. i hadn't seen her since nye last year, so its been quite a while. she held onto this picture of tyler that i apparently left over at her house a (VERY) long time ago or something.. she had told me about it a few months ago so i told her to hold onto it til we saw one another again... and i see the picture, and its this OLD OLD pic of ty when he was just born. he was probably a month old, if even that old. i had completely forgotten about that picture because i hadnt seen it in so long. when i first got the pic from her, we went out to eat at magnolia's cafe (my first time- not bad) when i was in my car, i compared the two pics of ty at 1 mo. old to the one of his school picture for this year-- he's 9 now!! he still has his chipmunk cheeks :D still has his strawberry bottom chin, and the same nose. so cute!! 

anyways, on new years eve, we went to america's party. it was so packed there. a lot of people left early to go to 6th street though. saw a lot of people i thought id never see again. reggie started a fight with gilly, but it was quickly ended. the cops came later, saying for everyone to go inside - a lot of people were outside in the front by the parking lot. everything was cool though. after 12, we left. wanted to go to 6th st. as well, but we stopped by kelly's apt first. there were 7 people in my little ass car. dont forget that it's a geo prizm!! tiny little car. but somehow we managed to fit eli, sergei in the front, with jake, teara, megan, and angela in the back. i dont know how we did it, but we did it! :)  a lot of people from america's party ended up at kelly's as well. we all finally left around 4something in the morning. sweet zzz's. i didn't get much done in austin that i wanted to get done.. which was to visit nick, mike, and ryan. look for a jobby job. use my slr cam and finish up some of that scala film. go to amy's ice cream. register at acc. although i did not get these stuff done, some good things did happen. i got to see eli, finally!! hey, its been almost three months!! got to spend some time with him. i got to eat at sandy's. ive not been there in so fucking long. got to go to boyz cellar like two nights, i think. and i got to see everyone! i got to see laura and hay's apartment for the first time. oh ya, i did get to try austin's lemon pepper chicken @ wing stop. houston's better. loaded with more flavor. yummy. 

seeing eli on sunday in houston was great! he and i had planned to go to the houston aquarium, but as it was getting late, i had my mom call him on my cell phone to see how far he was from here.... they talked for about a minute or two. she hung up and said, ""he's not coming. he had to turn around. there was bad traffic in la grange that was backed up for miles.""  i was like, awww. my heart sank. earlier that day, i was grinning from ear to ear, so eager and excited for him to arrive... and then just like that, my smile was gone. i went into my room, and dad came in and said, ""you left your car lights on.""  im like, *thinking* ""no way, i just got home like 45 minutes ago, and i KNOW i did not leave them on."" so im like ehh?? ok.... so i get my keys to go check.  mom and dad are like standing near the doorway/foyer and mom looks out the window (apparently to check whether my lights are on or not) and i open the door. i turn around facing my stepdad, and i say.. i know i did not leave them on.

i turn around.... and there is eli. :) :)

bam, just like that, all smiles again!! gave him a huge hug and we talked inside for a few and then headed off to the aquarium. funny thing is it's right by i45 and is SO visible to everybody who passes it... but i dont think anybody knows how the fuck to find it. since it is in downtown houston, many of the roads were one-way streets, so we were literally going in circles, getting lost, figuring our way there, getting lost again, figuring it.. lost.. and then finally finding it. on the outside, it looks awesome. looks fuckin huge inside.. we go in, look at fishies, and eli tells me which ones are which. i was pretty much his student for the next hour or so. we got to pet these tiny little stingrays.  their ""skin"" is soooo soft and slimey, but theyre so cute. there was this little glass dome inside the tank, but i didn't notice that there was a little kid in there looking at the fish from ""underwater"". and i go hey!! theres a kid! how the fuck?  and eli points to where the kid accessed it.. and im like, hey, i wanna go under there!! so i wait for the kid to get out, and eli's thinking that im crazy, but im like hey... why the fuck not?? :) so i get to my knees and hands and crawl under.  it was so FUCKING TINY... but it was cool seeing stingrays swim at eye-level, and on top of me. i got out after a min and then eli went under there... haha. and then, the aquarium was over... we were like, ""Wtf? that's it!?!?"" cos it was a lot smaller than we thought.. and we figured it out- one floor, aquarium. 2nd and third floors, restaurant. 
yep, that explains it.  afterwards, we went to the hard rock cafe, but it was soooo quiet in there considering the fact it was like 10pm on a sunday. we talked, chilled, and ate. after that, he went back home to austin. 

it was great to finally see him. i kept on telling him not to cut his hair, cos it looks sooooo adorable. its getting quite long now, and since its curly, im like ooh la la. 

since the 30th of last month, i feel different. things have happened since then.. :)

"event","damn, its been a long time since i have updated my LJ.  whats new with me since i last typed up something in here? hmm.. oh ya, school's done. finalllly! this was a fucken long ass semester and im so glad its over. i also went to austin for nearly a week and got to see a lot of old friends. its always good to see everyone. it was really great being out of houston for a week. i got to do one of the things i wanted to do during my visit in austin and that was to go to the 37th street lights show thingy. after begging and convincing mike to go with me, we finally went. i told him he would like it and wouldnt be disappointed, but he was like.. no, its just lights!! im like cmon, just wait n see see. ah, and sure enough, it was awesome. i dont think it was as good as the last time i went there, but the lights were still incredible.  i would love to live on a street like that, where all the neighbors agreed to light up their house with millions of lights. mike thought it was cool too, so mission accomplished. since i have been back in houston, i have finished up my shopping and only have one more thing to get tomorrow- for nick.  i also have to get my other set of parents something as well, but i have until friday to do so, bc we aren't celebrating our christmas until saturday. 2 nights ago was dtec's christmas party and it was actually fun.  last year's kinda sucked bc it was organized by this bitch at work, lacee. the party was too.... how do i put it? too ""nice"". just too boring. but this year's party, organized by my daddy, was mucho more fun. there was dancing, and it was very laid back. everyone seemed to really enjoy themselves. some people had a little too much fun. a lot of booze involved. :) and now tonight, when i finish this up, im going to ANOTHER christmas party, at my dad's house. we do this every year- fry turkeys and have all the neighbors and some friends over for more booze and fried turkey, of course. daddy says gonna be fun. i guess ill be the judge of that when i haul my ass over there. 

anyways, here's a little something from my other journal, so i dont have to type it all up all over again. thank goodness for copy + paste!! :D  

shit, two more days until christmas.  and then in just about a week and a half, the year is going to be over. like i have said before, time is really flying by so fast and i dont even know where it goes.  hmm.. right now, life is really shitty for me. im just so unhappy here. im tired of being in houston, and when i go to austin, im so much happier.  although im not completely happy, things are better there than they are here.  i know that in order to be totally happy, i have to let go of things in my past and move on. i have a lot of things to figure out. a lot of thinking to do.  i need to figure out who i am as a person and who i want to be.  right now, im just so scared of living.  im not saying i want to die, because i dont, but life scares me. i feel like i need to move away, somewhere far away and be on my own for a couple of months or even a year.  i need to discover myself and experience life away from everybody i know and love. 

last night really sucked because of what happened with a certain person. im just going to call him sulley. (and why sulley? bc its the first thing i see when i turn my PC on- wallpaper pic of sulley and boo from monsters, inc.)   i did something really stupid 2 nights ago and i told sulley about it last night because i didnt want him to not know.  it was eating me up so bad. i couldnt get it off of my mind.  sulley's really REALLY good at making me feel guilty.  i already was feeling really bad and ashamed of what i did, but he made it so much worse.  i guess i got what i deserved though.  i told myself a long time ago i would never cry over a guy. i didn't want to cry, but it was soo hard to keep myself from allowing these tears roll down my cheeks, staining my skin with the pain that they hold. it got me thinking about a lot of things, like how the hell do other people do it without it bothering them? doesn't it eat away at them?! how can they live with that guilt? funny thing is sulley and i aren't even together, but i couldn't not tell him. it hurt too much to lead him on thinking everything was ""perfect"".  everything about that night, i totally regret. but when i think about it, i think of it as a mistake that i learned something from. being so inexperienced with relationships, this was a wake up call. it has taught me that even if you're not with somebody, but but you care about them, then dont do something stupid to fuck it up.  i am so much more aware now that i have felt these emotions and caused pain not just for him, but for myself as well.  to be honest, i am starting to wonder if i even deserve him.  he's such a wonderful person and i feel that he deserves someone better. i feel like if somwehere in the future we were to go out, i think i would tell him no, even though i want him so much. 

yeah.. fuck.  

well.. now that this is out, im feeling a TAD TAD TAD bit better. i know im not going to feel better for a while, but its my problem to deal with. 

QOTD: Why can't we get all the people together in the world that we really like and then just stay together? I guess that wouldn't work. Someone would leave. Someone always leaves and then we have to say good-bye. I hate good-byes. I know what I need. I need more hellos.

ah, i finished 'the da vinci code' last night.  andrea told me today when we were at the hospital, that they were going to make it into a movie (coming out in like 2005) and its gonna be directed by ron howard & under sony.  should definitely be a great film.. if they dont fuck it up.  hmm.. we discussed who we thought should play the different characters in the book and we both think harrison ford may be good for the professor role & we couldn't decide who we thought should play the young cryptologist- but now that i think about it, i can see franka potente or perhaps famke janssen play her.  oh well, i guess we'll see. i think sean connery should play either the curator of the louvre or even better, the british historian....  haha.. im just really excited that its going to be a movie. i just hope im not disappointed by it as most movies are never as good as the book.  

anyways, school finishes tonight.. and then court tomorrow.  i thought it was on tuesday, but i was wrong. so ya, i gotta get up early in the morning to work for my dad n make some money and then head over to the courthouse on chimney rock and see if i can take defensive driving. hey, i only went 13 over the mph limit!! :) haha.. we'll see.  and then afterwards, im expecting to go to austin bc kelly needs me to pick her up from bergstrom airport.  i will likely be meeting up with michael n look at diff apartments. and see what i can find for a job over the next couple of days.  time is really crucial. ugh.. 

hm.. xmas shopping. i have a couple more gifts to buy, but im just about done with the heck family. i just need to get something for nick, andrea, and jeff. will be buying mom j and dad d's present from one of the antique stores in austin, probably on s. congress. hmm ya. got to get the pictures sent in to the scala lab for someones present, too. 

ah well, got to run.

"event","damn, i dont think i have ever done this good in college in 1 semester. haha i must say i am proud of myself for getting the grades i did on my papers.  got a 100 on a portfolio of 2 papers for my psychology class on STD's and abortion. got a 50 (out of 50pts) on my gov't paper which i didnt think i did all too well on.. but got lucky! :) and i just got my anthropology paper grade...... a 90. not too bad, but i felt like this one paper should have gotten the 100, not the other 3 papers.  oh well, im still satisfied with a 90.  it was probably only a 90 because it was late.  whoops.  my fault. that was the most weirdestest paper i had ever written though. it was about female circumcision, yes.. FEMALE!! it is just so sad.. how all these women/girls dont have a choice in other countries and must undergo this surgery.... without anesthesia! that has got to fuken hurt! 

anyways, this weekend is gonna suck balls. so much studying to do. am going to take my psych final tomorrow and write a 2000 word paper for english on smoking. basically a paper on how leisure is connected to business. stupid paper. 

ahh, last night.. whoo.. or should i say this morning? at 1:30 am, went over to lacey's to help out with something n we chilled n caught up n hit up blunt before gilly & sergio came over n ofc had another. chronic... nuff said. :D played dominoes and kicked some ass. :D bring it on gilly. next time, still kickin ass, slammin dominoes down on the table. his's excuse for losing this time: *im fucked up. if i was straight, id whup your ass!* haha... really, we will see. 

whoo, mom just came in here n said were going to dad's work bc there r cops over there since someone tried to break in the office.  damn.. sad, we live in a world where people feel the need to break into places and steal stuff or whatever.

"event","first lj entry ever.  this is gonna be my ""so there"". learned about the so there site not too long ago n told krista about it. wonder if shes checked it out yet. 
ah well i went to the dr today and didnt get happy results. i have to have a mammogram (ack! im scared! pain, will?) n an ultrasound, which ive had before like 2 times. its so weird seeing your boob tissue on a screen. other than that, i am healthy as a horse. 
i have 3 finals this weekend, which i am not looking forward to. am not worried about psychology bc its an open book, open notes final... cos its online, hehe. and hmm ive got one for anthropology, which i am gonna have to study for bc this one's on campus n i cant cheat. :( i should do ok on it as long as i study!! the one im dreading is my gov't exam even if its open book, open notes!! its just so fucken hard. the professor asks you questions that you have to literally tear up the book and look all over for it bc its hidden somewhere in a paragraph, and mind you.. each chapter is like 50 pages each... all full of information, ugh.  i have to get an A on my govt final in order to maintain a C in that class, ugh... and there's comp. 2... just have got to write an essay.. which i will do on friday.  other than that, i am drained and so fuken ready for school to be over. 
and then next week's gonna be crazy.. court, dr, and then.. off to awestin job hunting!!!! :)  have got to find something or i cannot move!!!! :-P  ah well.. off to bs around.

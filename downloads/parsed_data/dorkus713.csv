Some examples of the Unicorn Form are Eve<br>(Christian) and Pandora (Greek).
The Unicorn is associated with the concept of<br>innocence, the number 3, and the element of<br>water.
Her sign is the twilight sun.

As a member of Form 3, you are a curious<br>individual.  You are drawn to new things and<br>become fascinated with ideas you've never come<br>in contact with before.  Some people may say<br>you are too nosey, but it's only because you<br>like getting to the bottom of things and<br>solving them.

Tonight was misha and cori go off to steps house and lick the bowl while getting some drinks of wine and then running around FredMeyers like crazed maniacs! Okay so maybe not, i sat on the floor a bit while the two wondered off.  I bought SINGLES on dvd tonight, only eight bucks! WHEE!!  I was just thinking about that movie yesterday or the day before and wanting it on dvd since i only have the recorded off of tv version. Parts missing, cut out scense and comercials.  
Wilson owes me money from Warped Tour!!  damnitjanet!
Yeah i got my slides back today thank you to cori...they freakin rocked.

Actually a printed a few today as sample prints to hang on the wall at work. My friends will love me when they come into the store to visit...which by the way only cade has so far and it was really breif with Nate to pick up a cd of their photos that ive taken for them so far.

But i did get some good comments on my photos from work people. yeah.  I think i should put a Ben picture as well since he works downstairs and has to come in every once in awhile. he wont like that...actually, knowing him, he probably would if it was the one im thinking of putting up...he looks all tragic rockstar like!!
Too bad i cant put any Step pictures up cause she wont get her pictures taken so that i have some stuff for my website and portfoliolio.  I need to convince cade to let me take some portraits of him. i really need some work with my light kit before January....any takers on modeling for me. Nothing crazy like, just fun. And no wilson not that fun!

8) Dating someone who was hurt pretty nasty like in their previous relationship and taking it out on you!!!  
9) Being a girl and having fucked up crazy hormones that controll
10) Being labeled as a certain way just because your a girl and not being given the initial chance to prove them other wise and having to work hard to get rid of the labels.
11) Feeling like giving up on trying to surpass the labels and leaving it all behind.
12) Screaming at the top of your lungs and no one being able to hear it and it acomplishing absolutely nothing but maybe a sore throat in the end.
13) Having no money after working your ass off for some $$
14) Only getting to spend the little bit of money you do have on things you HAVE to spend it on and not things you WANT to spend it on!!!
15)People not talking to you and you dont know why.

Things that DONT suck...

1) Singing really loud when no ones around to all your favorite songs.

4) Photography (if i ever have time to do what i really want)
5) Friends

8) Sleeping in.
9) Rain
10) Snow
11) Holidays
12) Birthdays (yours and not yours)
13) Staying up till the sun rises just talking.
14) Having a million and ten things in common with a boy and always having things to talk about.
15) Having on 11 days of school left till you graduate.
16) kicking his ass at pool/darts and letting him tell his friends that he let you win, but knowing that they know just as well as you do that hes a bad liar, but letting him think they all believe it. :)
17) naps
18) movies on a rainy cold day with the fire place lit and hotchocolate
19) Beer and pizza and icecream
20) Finger Painting

hmmm...i like this one a bit better. Xpt i dont agree with the feet part, specially not right now, my left foot and ankle are so completely swollen i cant stand it. I can hardly stand either. Its almost twice the size of my right foot.  

This morning i went out to Vertigo to have brandon fix up my stars and of course he was late so nathan decided to do an ankle/foot tattoo. Covers almost my entire foot and hes only half done. Defly the absolute most painful place to get tattooed EVER!!!  Ive been gimpin it all day long and only wearing one shoe. HOpefully tomorrow will be better!!  YEAH NEW TATTOO!! its so absolutely awesomely coolishly beautiful!!  loves it!!  

Not much else here. started at lloyd center and i love it so much. Even on super busy days,  the stress doesnt get to me, and everyone seems really neato masquito like.  LOVE IT LOVEIT!!!  
So very happy at the new location! Upstairs Wolf Camera (in the lab) for anyone who wants to come visit me ever!!  yesdo!!

oh so pooped though, busy busy day, long busy day. tomorrow is my friday though. and i can only work for 6.25hours so as not to go into overtime. off at threefortyfive...yeah!!  
Maybe i will actually get to see Cade in the daylight for once, its been so long, i think weve only once ever had the same day off of work and it was a crazy busy day for me so i didnt get to use it!!  : (  

off to bed, zzzz!!!  sleepsleep, real sleep!!"

The sales staff is pretty good too, not that i have any time at all to talk to any of them though cause we are the busiest lab pretty much in the entire NW region. I LOVE IT!! Lab work is so fun. So i say now....wait till xmas season is over and i may not be saying that, but i dont have to talk to customers!! YEAHYEAHYEAH!!!  

My kittie is sleeping next to the computer, it is so adorable, i love it when they cram into small spaces.  

IM HAPPY!!!   Work is going good so far, school is almost over...im actually skipping right now, it  was either walk in late or  skip altogether. i chose door C!!!  

I feel bad i havent been home all weekend long. But cori and kitties you must forgive me, i dont get to see Cade again untill next weekend cause he has to work about 60-70 hours or so this week, plus he has band practice and the likes when hes not working or sleeping.  
Saturday i skipped out on Vertigo, brandons going to kill me cause i skipped friday to work on albums all night.  Cade and i went to dinner at Eagle Tai...so great. Then we went to see The Matrix at Century 16 on 82nd.  They were sold out so we wandered till the next one.  (I shall not comment on the movie)  After that we went home to his place and went to sleep. (SLEEP)  We both had work early in the morning and played phone tag all day, then hung out again after i got off of owrk. Played a few games of pool at the Bonfire, got a frozen pizza for dinner, hung out with some of his friends for a bit. then went to bed and slept (Slept)  Some how his alarm didnt go off this morning. He was supposed to be to work at 7.30am, i looked at the clock at 7.42am!! SUCK!!  Work again today, but its a mid shift so i will be home by 7.30pm which is so great. 
A few possibilities for the evening...
brandon fixing my star tattoos (prolly not though since i didnt show up saturday)
watching movies and working on a wedding album (must finish by tomorrow)

yeah no owrk or school tomorrow, that means laundry day!! MMMMM  and maybe possibly TOP BURGER for lunch!! NUM!!!   right. so off to get ready for work.

All i have to say is i better get paid this time.  Having your own business sucks for the matter that, if theres short funds, bills and others get paid before the owners do, and if there is no money left, there is no money left and you are screwed. So far the business owes me about 500$ that im sure i wont really get to see, actually more since i just landed us another wedding gig!!   That is all, i best get ready makin myself all cutesy girly for the wedding, yeah for girly...blah!!

We have so many freakin things in common and so much to talk about all the time.  Its crazy, but it ends up that every where i lived in seattle for the most part....He lived as well and pretty much at the same time.  We both lived in Renton only about amile away from one another and then when i lived on capital hill, he lived like five blocks away from me and we shopped at the same grocery store.  The only place i lived up there that he didnt was the U district, but his bestfriend Jesse (who is also his now roommate and band member)  lived only a few blocks fromwhere i lived over there and he was at his place all the time he says.  Major crazy coolness.  HMMMM....maybe hes stocking me and has been all these years and is just trying to play it off.  

*sigh*  

it was so cute, last night when we were hanging out, he was all....""when you meet my mom""....ahhhh, he wants me to meet him mom!! : ) HOW TOTALLY ADORABLE!!  Its funny cause he'll play it off that hes not sweet and such around his friends or when i call him on it, but they know and i know. and the way he plays things off its just like...duh, youre totally lying and not trying to hide it!!!

IM SO HAPPY!!!  I cant wait till school is out and things slow down a bit so i can see him more than twice a week.Hes already planning two trips for us.  one to the beach just to get away from the city and the other to seattle so we can go around to all of our favorite places and be like...hey i was here, hey ive been here too, i love this place too, yeah that sucks to and what not!! TOTALLY CUTE CUTE CUTE!! TEEHHEE!!!  

OH MY GOD...and hes a face grabber!!  (stephanie knows)  I must say there isnt anyone ive ever kissed that is as an amazing kisser as he is!! (Screaming in side cause im so happy right now and i dont want to ahve to wait till saturday evening to see him again. i want to see him NOW!!)

I havent been doing all that much lately but working, schooling, photoing and hanging out with cade in any spare moment we both happen to have at the same time, which isnt often. Maybe a few hours out of a few days aweek.  We are supposed to try and hang out tonight, but him and diago are working on their music video and he has to go buy the van after work, then try to squeeze me in somewhere after all of that. But if we dont get to hang out then i have a million and ten things i have to get done anyways.  AHHHH I cant wait to have tomorrow off of work. Im skipping out on my evening class as well. Well not entirely, im going to drop off my assignment and pick up the last one that got graded.  Then cori and i are off to Adaine's Halloween show.  They are dressing up as dead zombie geek boys!! I saw cade and jesses costumes the other night, they are so awesome. Too bad they are going to die from heat and the dead makeup melting off of their faces.  I get to take pictures of it all though, so im stoked about it.  : )   
The kitties are driving me absolutely bonkers right now, gggrrrr, go take a nap or soemthing or not eat the garbage bag, anything but bug me right now, im so fucking lameass tired. I just had a test that i completely bombed cause i dont ever study for them.  The bio labs are fun, but the lecture sucksnuts so hard core i cant stand it!!  
Friday is Halloween, but it doesnt feel like it at all, it seems that its already been and gone, our hwparty was so great that THAT was halloween for me. Cori as well im assuming since we just talked about that this morning.  We get to take hallween pictures tonight though for my photo class. THankyou cori head girliegirlgirl!!  i need a powernap before i have to head off to work in an hour. blah. My coughing is driving me bonkers aswell and making my head feel like shitiness!! BLAH!!

"event","dagnamit. I woke up this morning and my nose is all kinds of stuffed up. How freakin lame is that. I hate that, it makes it really hard to eat aswell.  I think cade maybe got me sick cause he was telling me about how the daybefore nate was sick and they where hanging out all day long. Damn the nate, i will beat him tonight at the show. probably not but thats okay i can pretend. 
The show at vertigo last night kinda sucked. It was great for the reasons of there being more than a hundred people there, very very cool for them, and me cause that means i get paid more.  But most of the bands fucking sucked nuts so hard core.  The only really good one was waldenDrive. Rythm of 84 is pretty descent, but they were jerks.  Plus the new sound guy is kinda a fuck job, and the new tattooist there seems to be aswell. Freakin a, im gone for two weeks from the shop and they hire a bunch of asswhipes.  The sound guy wouldnt let me up stairs, ""im sorry, this section is restricted to employees only...""  ""Dude ive been working for them a lot longer than you have ya little fuck!!""  So he let me up, i was a bit nicer than that though.  Also, also also....Atoms band, Compact 56 got offered to be signed by a big label. I didnt catch which one, but they had a meeting with them last night and they will find out soon.  Guess what this means.  I should be taking their presskit photos and what not and if they make it big, my name might get out there just a bit aswell.  Always use others fame to help bring you up!! : )  sweet fucking deal man!! I HOPE I HOPE, mainly for them, but for the shop and for my business as well. whee!!!   

Right so off to getting ready for work now.  And then tonight is Adaines show at the Saterican (i think, plus i cant spell it so whatever)  

Crazy kitties going nuts with out the mommies around more!!!"

"event","So i have a feeling i might be scaring Cade just a little bit. Im getting more used to him being around and talking to him that im acting more and more like my ""Normal"" self.  He says he thinks im a bit weird and a strange one. DANGIT!!!   silly boys, they just cant handle us. Well he best just wait till he really hangs out with cori and i!! MUAAAHHHAAAHHHAAA!!!  ; )  that is all, off to my ten hour work day, wheee!!! Then i get to come back this way and shoot a two or three hour show at vertigo. yeah aint life grand.  

and cade gets to come over tonight.  : )

>^..^<

yes life will be grand then!! ; )"

"event","So i have no freaking clue exactly what is wrong with my arm right now, but im about ready to chop it off. it hurts so freaking crazy bad like!!  I must have fallen dead asleep last night on my arm, i woke up in the middle of the night and couldnt move it. I kept trying to role back over to that side but my arm wasnt having it. Now i can hardly feel it, other than the throbbing and shooting pains!! BLAH, how lame is that.  
so its really really so very cool that Cade and i can hang out at home and JUST talk for hours and not have to fill any silent voids with movies or the likes.  We talked, listened to music and played with the kitties till about two in the morning.  I am absolutely loving how easy it is to talk to him and that we talk all the time and still have things to say to one another. yay!  Unfortunately i mostlikely wont get to see him until sunday night at his show. If anyone wants to go  its at the satirican??  Its on burnside and 6th downtown sunday night, i forgot to ask the time, or he just forgot to tell me.  Thats three shows in a row for me. Vertigo has one tonight and one tomorrow.  
MOVIE DAY at work. The boss is on his way to hawaii and its just the girls working so we are totally watching movies and it better be as slow today as it was yyesterday so that we actually can watch the movies, not like last movie day where we where swamped past closing.  Well best collect my stuff for the day and get a move one!!  
Silly kittie heads.  We fed them bottle caps last night, they are throwing them around the house right now, how fabulous!!!"

"event","so i skipped out on saves the day tonight cause i really didnt feel much like going out and had tons of stuff to get done. Luckily wilson was Aokay with that.
Ive cleaned a bit today, and worked on my Aug. 31 wedding album. Well i organized it and such cause i realized, i forgot to pick up albums from lauras yesterday. lame i am!!  

Kill bill last night was freakin crazy. I dont know exactly how i felt about it, but still it was pretty freakin cool!!

i would like for cade to not have to work on shit all night tonight and come over, but he was supposed to have tomorrow off, well he was on call, but they called him today to tell him they had some stuff for him to do, so now he has to work tomorrow and since he doesnt have all day anymore, he has to work on stuff with diago. Samples, flyering and such. Loser boys! : )  

I am kinda bored now though. All i really have left on my list of things to do today is to put away my laundry and do some reading for class. Neither of which i want to do. I think im going to just veg out and watch bram stokers dracula. BY MYSELF!! : (  Cori cori, you are missed already, but its cool cause you needed a vacation and you are probably having great times!!  

The kitties are very loveable today. Well yewbert is. I guess hes not used to having me around so much, hes been laying on my lap all day long every chance he gets or having me scratch his ears continuously!! HES THE BESTEST!!!   i love my baby and im sad i never get to see him as much as im sure he would like me to be around.  In about 6-9months though, i will be working more out of the house and not be schooling, and working three jobs.  Actually probably still the three, but not at stupid kits full time, i'll be doint my business full time instead and half of that stuff i can do out of my own place. yeah for kittie time.

You know what, i could really go for some desert right now. MMMM sweets, yumyum. Any takers on going out to get me some...yeah didnt think so, yewbert said he would if only he was old enough to drive. Dangit!!  

Cade and me are doing good...at least i think and hope they are. Hes been telling me how he wants to take a weekend off and go to the beach to stay at his uncles ginormous house and yesterday he asked me to go with him. SWEET DEAL!!  So im totally comfortable with him and all, i can be myself and act like my dorkiness of me (xpt maybe the humming of jingle bells when im cold, that tweeked him a bit i think, he makes fun!!)  but still he makes me nervous and i dont know why. Its cute though!  GRRRR, boys, im getting smitten over this one, its almost there, not quite as much as one would think, but its getting there.  Mainly cause theres more bonding friends like stuff than ""girlboy"" stuff right now, still working on getting to know eachother a bit more, but this will change soon, less talk, more ""TALK""  ; )  freaking a, shhh misha, stop it, get your mind out of the gutter!!   lalala!!   

the beer and the tiredness is getting to me a bit. I have to be to work at 8.320am in the morning for some stupid lame ass meeting. yeah i cant wait, the only bonus to that one is that there will be crispy creams waiting for me! NUMNUM. if he forgets the sprinkles this time hes dead, i hate managment. they suck nuts hard core, and not in any good type of way either! : P  

right so back to the kitties and movie and digging for sweets. No use cause there are none!!! Just the kitties!

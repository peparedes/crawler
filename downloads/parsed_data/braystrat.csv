"event","Wow...One of the best musical nights of my life.  I'd been trying to find this venue called Fusion for about  2 weeks, no one had heard of it and there was no website to be found for it.  Luckily someone from the Allman Brothers site helped me out and told me a general idea of where it's at.  Trying to find more information about the venue, so I could get tickets, I went to www.richmond.com and found this article about Oteil. http://www.richmond.com/ae/output.aspx?ID=3512565&Vertical_ID=3&tier=1&position=1   
On the bottom was a phone number listed.  I called at about 7:50.  The lady said the band starts at 9, but there are only 15 tickets left and they can only be purchased at the door.  So i hurried out the door, and got directions from the lady.  On the way I realized I didn't know whether the exit's off 95 or 64.  I tried calling a friend but got no answer, so I called a girl I worked with who told me to get on 95.  She calls me back and says ""actually it's 195"" at the exact moment I pass by 195.  So I had to get off on the next exit and come back.  Well I get off on 195 and did something wrong because I ended up going to some tollbooth and driving under 3rd and 7th street.  I managed to get directions from another friend.  I had to drive 10 minutes at least through downtown Richmond.  Looking for 12th street, I pass over 1st, 2nd, 3rd and so forth.  Of course i never saw 11th steet so passed right by 12th.  I come back by and get on 12 street and immediately see the venue.
Found a parking lot and rushed to the venue.  I see Paul Henson walk in a few feet in front of me, Paul being the singer.  I said hey to him, remembering how outgoing and friendly he was when I met him at the Lincoln Theatre, at that time I didn't even know what he looked like, just that I'd listened to quite a few bootlegs with his vox.  Got there and saw i could go upstairs downstairs or straight across to the bar.  I went downstairs and saw a guy standing by a closed door.  Sure enough there were tix left and I gladly paid him my 15 bucks.

For future reference: Fusion website http://www.fusionrichmond.com/
I walk in the venue, and notice one thing...it's very tiny.  It holds only 100 people....so being able to see the band of the caliber of Oteil's band in such a small, intimate venue was quite exciting.  The place had the feel of some sort of 40s jazz club downstairs, almost a private sorta thing, w/o the haze of cigarette smoke.  I decide to pull out a chair in front of where the band would play, since everyone there so far was sitting at tables.  A group of guys come to sit over where I'm at so I move over to let them in.  The guy next to me introduces himself and mentions that he knows Oteil pretty well.  We talk for a bit, then he says ""Hey ya know that guy over there, Butch?""  He's pointing to a guy sitting 2 seats from me.  At that moment I realize he does look a bit familiar, but hadn't paid attention.  ""He plays for the Dave Matthews Band.""  ""Ah yeah, Butch Taylor, their keyboardist.""  
the band comes out and Oteil gives a shot out to 2 of the guys sitting next to me, including the guy I talked to.  It was a great song with some nice scat work by Oteil and definite good playing by Mark.
Mark Kimbrell comes out playing a strat which sounded fantastic.  Oteil had a bit of a cold.  The band played a lot of jazzier stuff to start off with. The song that sticks out most during the 1st set was a song Oteil said he had to early in the show because there were church folk in the audience (from his church in birmingham alabama) and that they go to bed early.  
During the break, I bought their 2 cds and took them to my car.  On the way back I struck up a conversation with Mark and Paul along with some other guys.  The second set featured an incredible Butter Biscuit, a tune written by Oteil.  Oteil did a vocal scat line from Stevie Wonder's Jesus Children of America along with some bass tags and teases from other tunes.  They also did their Power Of Soul->Back in Black->Ocean (Hendrix/ac-dc/led zepp) medley.  Oteil sang on Power of Soul while the other two songs were just played instrumentally very shortly.  These songs aren't what you'd expect from this band, but they sound great.  They did this medley when I saw them at the Lincoln Theatre.
After the show, Oteil came up to the guys next to me and I just listened to their conversation.  He mentioned they were doing a show for WNCW, the public radio station out of spindale, nc that I used to listen to in high school.  He then mentioned that they're playing Raleigh friday and I let them know I planned on attending the show.  After the show, someone came up adn mentioned they liked my dtb shirt.  I later found out it was the guy that gave me directions and info on the venue from the ABB site, so I got his band's card.  All and all, a wonderful show, but being 12:40 and I wake up in less than 6 hours, I gotta go to sleep.

I decided to check out what kinda setlists Gov Mule was doing since I plan on seeing them this Sunday in Charlottesville....my first show up in Virginia!  Last night's setlist, unbelievable!  See for yourself:

02.13.05 Fox Theatre - Boulder, CO
SET 1: UNBRIDLED MULE
Warren on acoustics
Andy on hollow bodied electric bass

Real Thing - Warren Solo
In My Life - Warren with Matt On Djembe
Fallen Down - Full Band for rest of set
Patchwork Quilt
I Shall Be Released
Wine And Blood
Into The Mystic
And It Stoned Me
Lay Of The Sunflower
I Shall Return
Wild Horses
One

SET 2: FULL ON ELECTRIC MULE

Rocking Horse
Empty Pages
Mule
I'm So Tired
Drums
I'm So Tired
Perfect Shelter
Bad Little Doggie
Red House
Bad Man Walking
Mr. Man

ENCORE:
Little Wing
Pride And Joy
both with John Ginty on Hammond

Here's my analysis of the show even though I wasn't there...First of all Boulder is a terrific town, and I'd like to visit really soon, especially since I'm from the area.  A friend of mine says the Fox Theatre is an awesome venue.

Warren starts off solo with Real Thing, a great tune off the Phil Lesh album that had Warren and Jimmy Herring on guitar.  In My Life, I'm wondering if it's the Beatles tune, I believe Warren may have written a song with that same title.  The rest of the band come out on Warren's great tune Fallen Down.  And then the masterpiece, Patchwork Quilt, one of my favorite tunes written by anyone.  This is when it gets interesting...I shall Be Released, I'm thinking it's the Bob Dylan tune.  I'd love to hear this.  Then two Van Morrison covers, And it Stoned Me as well as Into the Mystic.  The Allmans did Into the Mystic in Raleigh 2 summers ago and it was fantastic, every bit as good as the original.  It's one of Warren's top 10 songs of all time, and another favorite of mine.  Another great Warren original, Lay of the Sunflower which was a collaboration with famed Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter.  Then we have a Warren tune, a Stones cover and a U2 cover.  
The second set seems more rocking....looks like the Beatles cover of I'm So Tired along with Red House.  The encore being Hendrix/SRV classic Little Wing and then the SRV blues staple Pride and Joy.  I'm ready for my Mule, no doubt."

"event","It's been roughly over a week since I moved up to RVA (Richmond, Virginia).  The hardest part so far was the moving aspect.  I decided to move on Tuesday, my old roommate and his gf helpe me pack up and then I drove a U-Haul by myself.  I make 3 stops, and then get to my apartment.  Unload most of my stuff with a little bit of help, and then I try to back my U-Haul in my space more and realize it's dead.  The lights come on, radio, but the engine won't budge.  I'm lucky that it didn't die sooner, so it was towed off.  This past weekend, I came back to Raleigh to get my car.  

My first week of work went pretty well.  The company's a bit swamped with work and really didn't have time to start me on anything until Friday.  I've been trying to learn AutoCAD, which I have no prior experience with, and learning the ins and outs of my job.  So far I've worked on about 5 or 6 projects, and this week I've gone on two trips.  Tuesday we went to a Wal-Mart we're designing stormwater drainage for at Harrisonburg VA, 2 hours away-where James Madison Univ is located, and today we inspected 11 construction sites for VPDES, Virginia Pollution Discharge Elimination System.  We started at 8am and I didn't get home until about 6.  

So far so good, I enjoy the job so far.  This past week has flown by.  A friend of mine did tell me that the first 7 or 8 months is the honeymoon, so I guess the drag of the real world may kick in sometime around then.  I've been pretty busy all the past week, arranging things in my townhouse.  Last night was the first night I was able to come home and just relax, well after my 2nd workout at Gold's Gym.  I've been too busy to really sit down and analyze how things are, I'm sure with more down time I'll be doing just that.  

I do find it kind of odd I was an env tech/science major before I went into env engr, and now I'm working for a land development consultant firm.  How long I see myself doing this kind of job, I'm not really sure.  Yesterday I could see myself do it for several years, but I always envisioned myself doing something with more importance.  What we do is important to a lot of people, because lots and lots of money is involved, but that kind of stuff isn't really relevant to me.  Despite that, I definitely have a drive to become good at what I do.  I haven't had this drive since I was probably in elementary school.  I feel like I haven't really been truly focused at anything schoolwise since then, and now I feel focused, things are making sense and I feel like I'm progressing.  

As for the following days, Friday-for lunch a bunch of us are going to this awesome Mexican restaraunt.  As for after work, I have no idea what I'll get into.  Saturday's the 12th of Feb, a day which I've dread every year for quite a long time...I'll try and start a new checking account and go to the gym.  Sunday, I plan on traveling westward for the Government Mule show in Charlottesville.  I need to go to a show, and nothing could be a better fit than having Mule kick my ass.  I put in the Live-With a Little Help From My friends-which also has Chuck Leavell, derek trucks and marc ford....I gotta see these guys again."

(Richmond, VA-February 9, 2005) -  A Norfolk, Va., legislator says the droopy-drawers bill may be his legacy. 

The Virginia House of Delegates has tentatively approved a bill to crack down on people who wear low-riding pants.

Freshman Norfolk Delegate Algie Howell Jr. introduced the bill at the urging of constituents who are offended by the exposed underwear.

Delegates approved a measure that would allow police to assess a $50 fine on anyone who exposes their below-waist underpants in a ""lewd or indecent manner.""

Howell said that since he introduced it last month, he's been deluged with calls and e-mails about the issue, mostly positive.

Howell told The Virginian-Pilot that he kept hearing from customers in his barber shop that something needed to be done about young people who wear their pants around their knees, exposing their underwear.

When a House subcommittee took up the matter, the response was sympathetic yet skeptical because of legal issues. It's going to the House floor for a vote.

Droopy-pants bill gets dropped in Virginia Senate


By the Associated Press

Published February 10, 2005

RICHMOND, Va. -- Virginia lawmakers dropped their droopy-pants bill Thursday after the whole thing became just too embarrassing.

The bill, which would have slapped a $50 fine on people who wear their pants so low that their underwear is visible in ""a lewd or indecent manner,"" passed the state House on Tuesday but was killed by a Senate committee two days later in a unanimous vote.

Republican Sen. Thomas K. Norment said news reports implied that lawmakers were preoccupied with droopy pants.

""I find that an indignation, which dampens my humor,"" Norment said.

Republican Sen. Kenneth Stolle, the committee chairman, called the bill ""a distraction.""

The committee hearing drew a standing-room-only crowd that included about 75 government students from Surry County High School.

""If people in Florida can wear bikinis, a little underwear showing isn't going to hurt anybody,"" 17-year-old Elvyn Shaw said.

The bill's sponsor, Democratic Delegate Algie T. Howell, had no immediate comment on the vote. He has said he introduced the legislation on behalf of constituents, including customers at his barber shop, who are offended by exposed underwear."

So just like that, everything comes to a halt.  I mentally prepared myself to move yesterday and it didn't go through.  Right now I'm frustrated with it, but I'm sure my mindset will change and I'll welcome the extra week of vacation.  So looks like I'll move on Saturday.  Everything I have is packed, my clothes, CDs, yup those are the essentials.  Like this morning I just have to hear Gregg Allman's version of Will The Circle Be Unbroken, but I'm not sure where it's at, I don't recall going through it when I was getting my CDs together. At least the CDs are in alphabetical order for the most part.  I'm not about to unpack my stuff, it's just going to stay in the boxes.  The thing that bothers me most is what the people I'm working for will think of me for not moving this weekend.  The lady I talked to said they were understanding and flexible, I think she understands.  Since, the storm didn't do as much damage as was anticipated, it could be perceived that wussed out of the move.  But everything was working against me yesterday.  If I'd been on the road and encountered bad weather, it could have been really bad.  

Wahoo! just found my Gregg CD, along with a Stevie Ray Blues at Sunrise CDs and two Muddy Waters cds.  However I won't be able to see Gregg and his band at Norfolk next Friday since I'll be in NC.  His Greensboro date later this month's on a Tuesday.  I'm real disappointed I'll miss these shows, it's not often that you can see Gregg in theatres.  I'm listening to his song Queen of Hearts, which someone just now told me to check out, and like the guy said, ""gregg's voice really shines in that song.""  it definitely showcases his singing.  Great great tune.  I've heard bootlegs where his voice is subpar, due to too much smoke or whiskey, but this show he sounds perfect, as he does nowdays.  Circle Unbroken sounds like a gospel track, simply amazing.  The great thing about the CD, I actually have a signed copy of the program from this tour, with the same cover as the CD. My uncle gave me the program for christmas.  Signed ""Best Wishes, Gregg Allman.""

hmmm another person just asked if queen of hearts was on the CD."

"event","Weather created very little problems in this area, so the move to Richmond is a possibility tmr, just a matter of being able to pick up my couch and get a U-Haul.  So this would mean I would move tmr, get my cable/internet installed on Monday, and then start work on Tuesday.  I just realized that Gregg Allman and Friends is playing the Norva Theatre in Norfolk Virginia this coming Friday.  The Greensboro date that I planned on attending is on a Tuesday, so I won't be able to go to that.  Tix for the Norva show are 22 bucks.

Mapquest says it's 1 hour 55 minutes meaning I can get there in at least 1 hour and 30 minutes.  95 miles on the interestate.  So I'm guessing hopefully get off work 5ish...drive straight to Norfolk.  Hopefully this works out."

"event","Well, after a 2 or 3 year hiatus, ""the most rock and roll"" rock and roll band is back.  On their website there is a show from October 17 2001.  Really good qualtiy recording.  

Setlist from Crowesbase goes as:

Midnight From The Inside Out
Sting Me
Kicking My Heart Around
Horsehead
Cosmic Friend
Remedy
High Head Blues
She Gave Good Sunflower
Sometimes Salvation
How Much For Your Wings
Buttermilk Waltz Jam -> Mojo Hand Jam -> Thorn In My Pride
Time Will Tell
Soul Singing
Wiser Time (w/Dave Scher)
By Your Side
Twice As Hard
Jealous Again
- encore -
Better When Your Not Alone
Can't You Hear Me Knocking

# Beachwood Sparks opened the show.

I saw the Crowes 4 days earlier at the Ritz Theatre...great show.  I still remember the band pulling in on their tour bus and keyboardist Eddie Harsch waving at teh crowd and Rich Robinson, being typical Rich, closes the bus shades.  Ha what an ass.  Before ""Miracle to Me"" Chris says something to the effect ""It'd be a fucking miracle to me if my brother would ever get this damn song right.""  Rich shoots him a mean look, but no punches were thrown.  I still remember the blue shirt Bill Monroe tee that Chris was sporting.  Possibly the loudest show I've ever been to but it was pretty damn awesome.

Anyway this 10/17/01 show sounds smoking.  Chris goes off on his typical rant to pump up the crowd before Kickin My Heart Around:
""Like I said it's called rock and mother fucking roll music.  So I gotta tell ya, we gotta lighten up a little bit in here and move around a little bit and quit just staring at us and shit.  ya know what i mean.  this ain't a fucking dave matthews concert, man.  ya know.  he's a nice guy he's a nice guy but this is rock and roll music.  so you don't have to worry about if you're being too cool or too unfucking cool know what i mean you gotta get into man you know that's how it is.  otherwise you wated your fucking money by coming to see us.  

Audley Freed sounds awesome on this show, being the badass guitarist he is...and to think he's actually played my 68 Fender Super Reverb amp, the very one sitting in my room and said he liked it...hmmm maybe I won't sell the amp.  

They do Can't You Hear Me Knocking as one of the encore songs, Rolling Stones tune off Sticky Fingers.  The song often reminds me of that JOe Peschi movie when they're killing people and that song's playing in the background.  I'd been looking for a cover of this song for quite some time.  The end solo that Audley has a totally different vibe than what Mick Taylor did on the original version.   Mick's always reminds me a lot of Santana, just the tone, sustain and the R&Bish/Jazzish comp being played underneath.  


The featured show on nugs.net is a Dec 17-19 2004 Phil Lesh and Friends show...
 
Lineup:
Phil Lesh - bass, vocals
John Molo - drums
Jimmy Herring - guitar
Chris Robinson - vocals (Black Crowes)
Barry Sless - guitar, pedal steel (Kingfish, David Nelson Band)
Steve Molitz - keyboards (Particle)
Gloria Jones - vocals (Jerry Garcia Band)
Jackie LaBranch - vocals (Jerry Garcia Band)
Tim Carbone - violin (Railroad Earth)
John Skehan - mandolin (Railroad Earth)
Dave Ellis - tenor sax (Charlie Hunter Trio,various solo)
Kevin - trumpet
Marty - trombone

Jimmy Herring being the only guitarist, and that's all you need.  I couldn't believe they covered the Crowes' Wiser Time.  Sounds like Herring listened to a bit of Marc Ford on the Amorica release.  Great stuff.  

""Wiser Time""
No time left now for shame
Horizon behind me, no more pain
Windswept stars blink and smile
Another song, another mile

You read the line every time
Ask me about crime in my mind
Ask me why another read song
Funny but I bet you never left home
Chorus:
On a good day, it's not every day
We can part the sea
And on a bad day, it's not every day
Glory beyond our reach

Seconds until sunrise
Tired but wiser for the time
Lightning 30 miles away
Three thousand more in two days"

"event","Grammys Add West, Tributes To Charles, Southern Rock

This year's top Grammy Awards nominee is planning to show his skills in a monumental way during next month's 47th annual ceremony. Kanye West, who is up for a leading 10 honors, including best new artist, will stage a performance incorporating the talents of R&B legend Mavis Staples, celebrated vocal group Blind Boys Of Alabama and R&B newcomer John Legend.

Staples is among the Recording Academy's 2005 Lifetime Achievement Award honorees, while the Blind Boys are nominated with Ben Harper for ""There Will Be a Light"" (Virgin) in the best traditional soul gospel album category. The set's title track is up for best gospel performance.

The Feb. 13 show at Los Angeles' Staples Center will also feature a tribute to the late Ray Charles by contemporary blueswoman Bonnie Raitt and storied soul artist Billy Preston.

Another newly planned performance is a landmark Southern rock jam featuring members of genre stalwart Lynyrd Skynyrd joined by former Allman Brothers Band guitarist Dickey Betts, Elvin Bishop and country artists Tim McGraw, Keith Urban and Gretchen Wilson.

They join previously announced performances by U2, McGraw, Alicia Keys and Green Day.

Norah Jones, Ludacris, Sugar Ray singer Mark McGrath and actor Gary Sinise have signed on as presenters for the show, which will be hosted by Queen Latifah and broadcast live on CBS.

-- Barry A. Jeckell, N.Y.


Guess I'll have to watch the ray tribute and the ""Southern Rock"" tribute oh yeah and Ben Harper if he's on there with the Blind Boys.  Dickey Betts'll be on there, gotta see my boy Dickey for sure...though I'm not too keen on the Allmans being considered southern rock, though Dickey did have that southern thing going for him that's for sure."

"event","Been updating this thing way too much, with no school and not working yet, just way too much time on my hands.  Well nothing brings instant gratification than materialistic goods, so I bought a TV, stereo, and some speakers.  A friend got me fantastic deals on them and I'm also buying his sectional couch.  So with one trip, I have most of my living room completed, and i thought it'd take several months.  Feels great to have that out of the way.  I have now a 32"" flat Sony tv (turns out my roommate has the same tv, i didn't realize it) an 80 watt Denon receiver and a pair of Polk audio speakers not to mention all the cables I'll need.  I'll have room to expand my home stereo system if I ever feel the need.  I nearly bought a 300 CD changer, but decided against it.  It'd be nice to hold all my CDs, I have probably 250 CDs right now.  Feels great to have much of my living room comlpeted and actually own my own stuff.

Music wise I've been listening to the Duane Allman anthology all day.  The collection has his work when he played at Muscle Schoals and Fame studios, and also a cut from his band Hourglass (with Gregg Allman) and some tracks from The Allman Brothers Band.  Everything on here is phenomenal.  Hey Jude's great, awesome solo and the BB King medley's great along with the King Curtis tune (man I gotta get his Fillmore cd).  It's great hearing him play outside the Allmans, man that cat had some soul.  My favorite two tracks on the first disc though The Weight and Loan Me a Dime.  Arethra absolutely kills this song.  I've listened to it probably 10 times today.  The original version by the Band is great (it's on some TV commercial all the time) and the Grateful Dead did a cool version, but Arethra's version is just lively with Duane's slide guitar and the horns.  This song just puts me in a good mood.  Loan Me a Dime is just a great slow blues tune, Duane really plays his ass off.  The second Cd's great with all the Allman tunes and the two tunes with Eric Clapton.  Stand Back's awesome, it being one of those tunes that I think Duane just did perfect.   I'm just realizing now how good this guy really was.  Rolling Stone definitely gave him props by listing him as the second greatest rock guitarist of all time behind Jimi Hendrix.

"event","Well I went to bed last night kinda frustrated with my playing, especially trying to play along with the Allmans 6-22-00 version of Loan Me a Dime.  The song is originally by Boz Scaggs (who I know absolutely nothing about).  It's a slow minor blues, that Duane Allman played on.  IMO, some of Duane's best work ever.  Anyway there were certain licks that Jimmy Herring and Derek Trucks did that I can't even fathom playing.  However with one of my minute musical breakthroughs I did come up with some stuff.  

The progression's mostly an Am Dm type thing with the cool E+ chord (which instantly makes me think of the opening chord from the Beatles' Oh Darling)...think any minor blues 
Anyway there was a certain chromatic part that I interpreted originally as chords with an Am top and a descending bass note of A, Ab, G, F#.  The part really reminds me a lot of the descending part of Desdemona, off the Allmans last cd.  Anyway I realized that the chromatic part could also be interpreted as Am, E, G, D.  The Ab being the major 3rd of the E chord and the F# being the major 3d of the D chord, basically those two chords being inversions I suppose.  The E chord also can be considered a E augmented with the C note (the minor 3 of the A).  That same C note being the sus4 of the G and the flat 7 of the D.  
This realization really opened up my playing on this song, and probably any other song with this type of progression.  
Over the E I tend to play the 6th note if I do a run in the E major scale, it being the C# (major 3rd of the A chord) is a serious clash, so I have to not get into that habit.  Basically just have to avoid this note no matter what.
The change from the D-Dm brings a lot of interesting scenarios to solo over, the fact that the major 3rd changes to a minor 3rd.  
Over the E I focus on the 3rd (Ab, the natural 7 of the A) which really adds a cool flavor to the song.  
Other cool sounding notes is the flat 5 of the A, which is a blues staple, and the the second (B).  Well one more plateau I've overcome, I'll have fun with this for awhile.  But I really gotta learn more theory."

"event","It kills me know me that my mini-disc mics aren't working anymore.  I have to get some new recording gear, along with that fancy Boomerang crazy loop pedal I want.  Listening to some of my old recordings, which I think mostly suck...guess ya can always find the faults in your own work.  Though it was cool posting some of my clips on music and guitar sites, getting IMs from people that I'd never met digging my stuff and telling me they played along with my song all the time or they put all my stuff on a loop and listen to it for an hour...totally surreal to get that kinda feedback, but I just want that creative outlet I used to have.  Here's some comments I found from on an old Little Wing I did, I think it had quite a bit of soul but I could do way better now.  Kinda interesting reading these a couple years later:

"event","In four days, I'll be packing up my life and transporting its contents via cardboard enclosures and memories to Richmond.  My outlook on the move I suppose is like entropy and the yin and yang, ever changing and nearly total opposites.  One minute, I'm enthralled by the sense of adventure of moving to unfronted territory (well for me it is) and re-establishing my life and beginning a redefining period in this phenomenom that we simply refer to as life.   The following moment, I'm wishing I had never made that fateful decision and was staying put.
My perspective of the past few years and my life in Raleigh has changed.  I always felt like I had a steady base of friends that I could count on, but the realization of the magnitude of this steady base has finally dawned on me, just the warmth, and the reciprocal gratitude felt mutually between us is something that I now fully realize.  It's not that I was totally oblivious to it, but I know I've met people that have made a positive impact on my life and will continue to do so from here on out.  I'm just finding out how much certain people are there for me and the sincere connection I have made with these people.  Before I felt one of the reasons I wanted to stay in Raleigh was that it was a security blanket, I knew the town and was pretty familiar with it.  The other side of the coin says that life had become monotonous and that change is needed, that a drastic change was what was in order for me to find my niche.  Everyone I know seems to be finding their niche and I'm still looking to carve my own.
All last weekend until yesterday, the thought of leaving just ate me up...almost to where I could feel an emptiness, almost the equivalent of a broken heart.  These days were full of reminiscing and just trying to hold on to every shred of what life once was, whether it is my old college days or just the people I know in Richmond.  Every thought, every shared moment, full of sentimental value that could not be traded for anything else.  I feel like so many people have made a mark on my life.  And for anyone that I said ""Let's keep in touch"" it is sincerely meant.  
Sometimes the greatest moments taste the most bittersweet, and are sometimes part of the simple things in life.  It's hard to enjoy these greatest moments when I know deep down that I'll be leaving the area and leaving these special moments.  From this I gain a greater appreciation for these times.  They say ""absence makes the heart grow fonder"" but what about the anticipation of such an absence.  It's the times when I yearn for what I'm used to, the comfort, and all the great times of the past that are going to be the toughest to deal with.  I know moving, there are going to be hard moments, not knowing as many people and just times when I feel like I'm barely paddling on water, I'm making it but it's hard.  I suppose once I'm independent I'll learn to swim and find my shore. 
I've already felt the feeling of being ""more alone.""  Just this past week when I nearly got stuck driving in the snow in Richmond, I felt the feeling that there aren't as many people that would look out for me if I'm in a bind.  Ever since I could remember, I've always been one to try and do everything on my own, if I'm in a tough situation, just to tough it out and not ask the help of other people.  Since I was 2 years old I've been shrugging things off, for whatever reason, maybe defense mechanism but whatever, it is, that's how I've dealt with things.  But just having that support system, that added cushion, is a very comforting thought.  Being in a somewhat emergency type situation brought the feeling of that solitude, the fact that I wasn't within arm length of outstretched hands.  
So this past week I've cherished every moment I've spent with people, moments that ordinarily seem significant.  Just knowing other people are going through the exact same things in their lives I find very comforting.  And the fact that there are several people that were willing to take time out of their busy schedules to make my final week that more special is very touching to say the least.  To know that there are several people that volunteered to come up and help me move and keep me company on my first weekend in a new place means so much.  This in a way, makes everything harder about moving.  I sometimes ask why am I leaving a good thing?  But I know everything happens for a reason, and for some reason or another, I'm supposed to move away and start a new chapter of the Book of Life in a new city.  Perhaps more awe-inspiring is the thought that I might have made such an impact on peoples' lives that they would offer to help me out and that they tell me they don't want to see me leave.  
Feelings of anticipation and apprehension have been coming hand in hand.  When I signed that one year apt lease it felt exactly like that, I'm signing off one year of my life away.  My outlook on moving is not always like it is right now, sometimes more bleak, sometimes more optimistic, sometimes more exciting.  This is what I find great with myself writing, I'm just letting out how I feel at an exact instant, a snapshot if you will of my mind at this very moment.  Maybe 5 minutes later, the snapshot will be more clear or brighter, perhaps it'll have more questions.  That's it for now, more analytical probes into my head later, think I'll go put on some cds and relax."

"event","Last night was a very fun and pretty damn entertaining night to boot.  My old roommate of 2 years Easy, who lost 2 belt sizes and regrettably showed us, came down from NYC, first time any of us have seen him since he moved away in July.  I need to go up there and visit, most likely during the Allmans annual Beacon run.  The dates this year are March 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19.  Anyway, Ryan and I go to Amore's and then head over to the kegger at Corey's, donated 10 bucks apiece and hit up the keg.  A decent number of people showed up.  Plenty of red bull, yeager, and a full keg of beer.  After all the girls left, it all went downhill. Somehow beer was thrown around the room, 3 loaves of bread obliterated all over the carpet couches ceiling and a big chunk on the ceiling fan and a 3 legged table standing sideways with cards stuck to it from all the beer.  We definitely reverted back to our freshman year, and I suppose our soph, junior and first senior year for that matter.   Anyway here's to Easy and good times."

"event","It's really starting to really hit me that I'll be leaving Raleigh soon.  Some moments it doesn't bother me as much, others it does.  It's not the fact I'm leaving the city, it's the people I know in the city.  Right now, I don't want to go through with it...leaving people I know, the comfort zone, and then moving to unfamiliar territory.  After the Derek Trucks show (I'll make an entry tmr about that) I went and saw my friend Brooks' band play.  Well I used to jam with the guy and even did a few acoustic duo shows...well sometimes with my electric at a few bars with him.  Just hearing some of the songs made me think of the fact I'll be leaving the area and everyone I know.  It's moments like these that I have my doubts about the whole thing.  My attitude about it tmr could be entirely different, but I know tonight if I had to make the job decision, I'd stay in Raleigh...but the decision's already been made.  It just really sucks that I have to leave right now.  I was kinda excited about it, but right at this instant I'm most apprehensive about it.  And I know the time's coming soon, and I sorta want to have a hangout with everyone I know either at my place or at a bar, but so many goodbyes will be hard to make in one night, I honestly don't know if I want to go through with it.  Maybe it'd be just easier to just leave and not make a big deal about it.  It's about 3:20 and I've had quite a hectic 2 days, I'm going to sleep."

"event","It's real late night, 1:12 am, meaning I need to go to sleep soon.  I just finished Dan Brown's Angels and Demons....the prequel to the Da Vinci Code.  I'm not sure I like it as much as Da Vinci Code, but it has all the same type cliffhangers and written much in the same style as the Da Vinci Code.  Both books will make you ponder things, that's for sure.  

Earlier today, I found out about an apartment available.  It's a one bedroom townhouse, located 2.8 miles from my job.  It has a super deal-no rent payments until April.  The rent's a bit steep-720, but online it's listed as 770, so if I get this before Jan 23, which I will do if I decide to take this place, rent's only 720 and I live there free until April.  It also has W/D unit, which many places that I looked at didn't.  There are a few other places I may consider.  I can put a nonrefundable $99 deposit on the place to hold it, which I'm considering doing because it's such a good deal.  I called my friend up in Richmond about it, and a girl that works at our place lives in the same apt area and said it was a nice place.  They gave a thumbs down to the other place I was considering.  

The plan is to go up to Richmond tmr to look at it, but driving up there for 3 hours isn't something I'm looking forward to.  The deal is good, and the fact it's a townhouse, makes me want to take the place immediately.  If my credit is good, I don't have to make a security deposit, just the $99 for credit/holding.  My credit/income has been approved for another place around the same price, so that's a good sign.  I know taking the place w/o looking at it isn't the best of ideas, but the deal's way too good and the fact it's a townhouse is a big deal to me.  And not having to pay rent while I'm getting settled in is very nice, as it would be my most critical time financially.  

I don't like having to pay 720 for a place, but it does mean I'll be living in a pretty nice area of Richmond, as some areas I've heard are a bit sketchy.  However if I pro-rated the place, it'd come out to be around 540, which is not bad at all for a single bedroom unit...I'm not sure if I would pro-rate it, ofr if they would let me, but it's a way for me to compare this price to others.  Oh yeah I also get a $100 coupon from Rent.com (Thanks Kristen!)  It is 4 min from work, about 15 min from the downtown/fan area...I'd like to be a bit closer, but this shouldn't be too big of a deal.  So the deal is, do I pay a 99 fee right now just to reserve it, so no one else can get this place, as this is a deal I don't want to pass up.  

What else has happened recently...Friday I jammed with some friends.  I made up a couple of things on the spot as well as the others.  We jammed on Santana's Evil Ways, House of the Rising Sun (I have no idea why I initiated that), Paint it Black (I started this as well), and Herbie Hancock's Chameleon.  I was playing with my Les Paul the majority of the time, so the jam ended up being way more ""rock"" than I anticipated, and less of the ""jam"" type I anticipated.  I feel I ripped up Evil Ways, sometimes I just play some stuff and get into and play stuff with soul...it amazes myself but it's not something I do all the time.  We also tried Lively Up Yourself but the drummer's not as much into reggae as we are, so we didn't feel it.

Sat and Sun involved tons of football...I mean what else is there to do on weekends.  Today I helped my roommate's gf with her resume and other job related type things and went with her on some errands.  We also did some things around the house.  I've gotten attached to her beagle, and may be getting one soon.  She suggested that I get a dog since I'm moving into a on bedroom apt. up in Richmond.  I'm currently on the search for a dog, and I'm leaning towards a beagle...they don't get too big, aren't hyper very often, and I just like her dog's mannerisms.  So hopefully I find something soon.

"event","One of the greatest songs I've ever heard....For Warren tunes definitely up there with Soulshine:

Patchwork Quilt

Lyrics: Warren Haynes
Music: Warren Haynes

Written by Warren Haynes in memory of Jerry Garcia, and played with Phil & Friends and The Dead.

    I never knew you
    But then who really did?
    If you were at all like me
    You managed to keep yourself hid
    A patchwork quilt of a life
    Memories embroidered
    On your soul

    So please forgive me
    For putting you in my song
    But the spirit she moves me
    In fact she pushes me along
    It's a patchwork quilt of a life
    Can't stop the river
    Just let it roll

    We were at Jones Beach
    When we got the word
    Saddest sound that I ever heard
    The bluest note that nobody could play
    Ravens sang with us that night on the stage
    Tears of sadness, tears of rage
    But nobody spoke, we all felt old
    And in the way

    So walk beside me
    Or above me, I don't know
    These days it sure seems
    I'm lost where ever I go

    God, how could you, I heard someone say
    And what do we do with our lives now anyway?
    Now that our North Star can no longer be found

    But there's a banjo moon in a tie-dyed sky
    Hippies dance and babies cry
    Church bells ring as a silver-haired angel look down
    And the blood of his music runs through the veins of our guitars
    Bright lights, Dark Star

    I never knew you
    But then who really did
    If you were at all like me
    You managed to keep yourself hid"

"event","So at about 11:33PM tonight, I realized I have done absolotely nothing.  I haven't even left the house.  It's one of those days you look back on in astonishment, and think ""How did I manage not to do anything?""  I did clean up my room a little, and I watched Duke come back and beat us in basketball.  How frustrating.  The announcers are so pro-Duke, it's sickening.  I basically went to a school that is next to the two most overhyped, most announcer-bias teams in the nation in UNC and Duke.  Gets pretty old quick.

Oh yeah, I accepted the engineering job in Richmond.  I'll be starting work sometime in the first of February.  I need to start finding an apt. soon.  More about that when I feel like writing.

So last night I attended the Berekeley Cafe Open Mic Blues Jam.  It's a popular open mic jam that occurs every Wed.  People have told me I needed to go for about 5 years.  So I go and meet a friend there with my strat in my hand.  The group playing there when I got there was really good.  They did some cool tunes including a nice cover of Miles Davis ""All Blues.""  Well my friend left and I didn't know anyone, and was starting to get tired of waiting to see if they were going to call my name.  At about 1:00, I decided if my name wasn't next I was going to head out...sure enough it was next.  So I go up there, with no one really to jam with.  Good thing about these jam sessions, finding people to play with is not a problem.  Well, I plug in my strat into a 15 watt POS Marshall that's mic'd.  Anyway I'm not getting any sound...for about 5 minutes.  Finally it kicked in.  Well some guy straps on his guitar and decides to join in.  The guy totally takes over the jam and says we're doing Wild Thing.  ""Oh great, Wild Thing.""  This sucks.  He plugs his guitar into this huge Line 6 amp.  Yeah I should have plugged mine into it, oh well.  He starts playing and his amp totally blows mine away.  Song gets underway, Wild Thing Starts.  I hit the opening chords, and suddenly I hear either my guitar is out of tune or we're just not in tune with each other.  There's also a keys, bass and drums.  The dude totally starts wanking on the guitar...All that's going through my mind is I'd rather be anywhere else in the world except here.  This absolutely sucks and it's a total embarassment...it's funny how some of my greatest moments and worse moments and other such life experiences have occurred playing live music-nothing quite like it...anyway back to wild thing, I have no choice but to play A5 D5 E5 power chords....and I hate fifth, power chords whatever.  I get absolutely no spotlight on it....oh well next song....He tells me Blues Shuffle in E I-IV-V.  I think cool...more up my alley.  I'm thinking I have my trusty slide in my pocket, I'll def pull it out.  Well song gets underway, he totally goes blues shuffle on steroids.  Totally gets up on the front of the stage and proceeds to wank away on some pedestal thing in front of the stage.  I squeeze in a couple of notes just to let the crowd and guys I'm with know I can actually play guitar, I'm not just some dude that'll sit and play 3 chords.  It being my first time attending the jam, I gotta leave some sorta impression.  
3rd song comes up and the guy that was in a group playign when i got there came up to play and sing Superstition.  Other than the fact this song has been covered a million times, I love this tune.  I could sense the bar filling up as we're playing.  I'm totally nailing the tone to the song, getting this real funky tone with my bridge pickup and playing really percussively.  I def felt like I could play the funk stuff better than the other two guys up there.  All was going well...Rock star points to the drummer to do a drum solo.  Impressive drum solo, keys solo, 2 guitar solos...I didn't get much limelight with this little ass amp, but I managed to squeeze a few notes.  Anyway, we walked off, I had no idea what people would think or said, i thought the jam went south....Everyone complimented me when I came off so that was cool...sorta but just weird too.  The drummer said it went well too so that was cool.  I found out the drummer has played with some popstars like J-Lo and Britney, meaning he has quite a bit of playing experience, just with crap pop stars, but it definitely speaks highly of his credentials.  I found out the rock star's name was Brandon as well, but we couldn't be further different.  The whole rock star thing at an open mic night was way too over the top.  Oh well, I'll probably go back next week, just hopefully not lpay with that guy again.....I'll plug into a bigger amp, and maybe just bring my Les Paul so I can get some volume. 

Music stuff I've listened to today:
U2-Achtung Baby
Allman Brothers - 2nd Set CD
Project Z - live show from Asheville I just downloaded
Jeff Beck - Blow by Blow
Jeff Beck - Wired

I told someone how I managed to do nothing today...his response:
yeah - that's ok though - gives you more to accomplish tomorrow

Here's to accomplishing more tmr and maybe setting foot outside the house.  Maybe start the Richmond apt hunt as well."

1. Never, under any circumstances, take a sleeping pill and a laxative
on the same night.

2. If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race
has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word
would be... meetings.

3. There is a very fine line between hobby and mental illness.

4. People who want to share their religious views with you almost never
want you to share yours with them.

5. You should not confuse your career with your life.

6. Nobody cares if you can't dance well.  Just get up and dance.

7 Never lick a steak knife.

8. The most destructive force in the universe is gossip.

9. You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and compelling
reason why we observe daylight savings time.

10. You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests
that you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging
from her at that moment.

11. There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to
make a big deal about your birthday.  That time is age eleven.

12. The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age,
gender, religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep
down inside, we ALL believe that we are above average drivers.

13. A person who is nice to you, but rude to a waiter, is not a nice
person.  (This is very important.  Pay attention.  It never fails.)

14. Your friends love you anyway.

15. Never be afraid to try something new.  Remember that a lone amateur
built the Ark.  A large group of professionals built the Titanic.

16. Thought for the day:  Men are like fine wine.  They start out as
grapes and it's up to the women to stomp the crap out of them until they
turn into something acceptable to have dinner with.

17. There is more money being spent on breast implants and Viagra than
on Alzheimer's research.  This means that by 2030 there should be a
large elderly population with perky boobs and huge erections and
absolutely no recollection of what to do with them.

13 is a huge reason why I didn't work for that guy starting his own engnieering firm."

"event","I just called the Richmond company, the lady responds by saying ""I hope you have good news""...I retorted ""Well....I'm coming up to Richmond to visit the place for the weekend.""  I told her that I can't make a fair decision w/o at least visiting the area, I owe it to myself.  She was very understanding and told me to take my time...she did mention that if there were a time for me to move...explore new things, it's right now.  
My goal this weekend...go up to Richmond and forget about the whole decision, just try to enjoy it...while making my decision by Monday...guess that sorta contradicts itself.  Pretty much, go up there and don't over think things and just enjoy them, but get enough of a feel for the town to help me decide if it's worth moving.  
So what did I do yesterday:
Sent out more resumes in the Raleigh area...got frustrated, stressed out...then  sent out more resumes...went to a friend's place that fixed my playstation...came back here sent out more resumes and looked at jobs...reminded myself that it's not the end of the world if i don't get a job right away...helped my roommate's girlfriend fix her resume and helped her find companies to apply to...looked up more jobs...took a break from it all and went to East Village with couple buddies that I worked with over the summer, which was a nice break from the whole job/life-metamorphasis that's being played out...EV was fun like usual, it's familiar, comfortable and a sure way to see people that I know, i suppose EV is the antithesis of Richmond.  I did see someone there that I had classes with...she's moving to Greenville and experiencing a lot of the same type changes I am...she said Richmond was great and I should consider it...stayed at a friend's place last night, decided against driving after having drinks, which is always a good thing...and came home this morning.  Don't feel like writing anymore...more later"

"event","Here it is about 11:30 on a Wednesday night.  Today I've been pondering how I'm going to begin this next part of my life.  Right now I feel like there's an unbearable amount of weight on me, a feeling that has been gracisouly absent since my graduation ceremony.  Pretty much everything has been smooth, no pressure, not many responsibilities and just total freedom, nothing tying me down, no deadlines to meet, no homework assignments to appease my professors.

Well I have a deadline approaching.  Last Friday I was notified that Koontz-Bryant, an engineering company in Richmond VA, offered me a a Project Engineer I position within their Residential Engineering Group.  My foot got into the door thanks to an old high school/college buddy that referred me to the company.  The interview I had with them went great, and I was nearly positive that I would get an offer.
The offer is pretty comparable with the entry level salaries of civil/environmental engineers and there are a decent number of benefits-paid vacation, paid sick leave, dental/health insurance, and profit sharing.  The company's great, and the people that I met seemed great.  Just walking around the place, I felt comfortable, like it was a fit.  So what's the problem?...Oh yeah, Richmond is just over 3 hours away from Raleigh, which means either a 6 hour drive everyday or I'll have to relocate.  
At first, it felt great to get that offer, especially right after finding out I passed the 8 hour FE (Fundamentals of Engineering) Exam.  I pretty much felt like I could get any job I wanted....and it's a good feeling getting that first interview out of the way, no need to ever be nervous for another job interview, which surprisingly I wasn't nervous for this first interview, I pretty much had the attitude that I already had the job, real assuring and confident.  


This week I had two interviews.  The first, a company that I had contacted before Thanksgiving break.  Turns out, it is a brand new company that has been around for a year, with two engineers.  They are in desperate need for help, so they contacted me Monday.  The next day, I interviewed with them.  I was a bit weary going to work for such a young company, but I thought it was worth a shot at least to go and interview.  Well I go out with the guy, he takes me out to a Chinese place to eat.  My first impression of him is that he was rather dull and dry.  On the ride over he mentions how he needs someone that can write well.  I tell him that my freshman english teacher tried to persuade me to become an english major and that I used to write for an online music website.  He then tells me how he graduated from UNC with an english degree and went back to NC State to get an engineering degree.  He also said he was a very technical, by the book detail-oriented engineer...from this I gathered he would be quite anal, thus a nightmare to work for.  He then goes on to tell me his disappointment with NC State's Engineering Dept. how when he graduated he had a prestigious degree, the NCSU College of Engineering was ranked 4th in the nation behind MIT, Cal Tech, and a school in Illinois.  He said the school dropped down to 20th in a matter of a couple years after being forced to graduate more minorities and females..after ""dumbing down"" the curriculum.  yes he did use those words.  So I'm thinking now, why's this guy talking to a guy that graduated with a 2.9 from a dumbed down curriculum.  So along with his other glowingly positive attributes, I would have to worry about feeling intellectually inferior to this guy...not good, I don't need an experienced engineer that I'm working for constantly remind me of how much smarter he is than I am....and on top of that he's probably some grammar freak.  
After listening to him talk for 2 hours, he tells me that either I can give him a number of what I want, or he could make me an offer.  I think I say something like 'OK' because I have no real interest in working for the guy.  The interview gave me quite the headache....oh and the irony, I just got this, the ""majority owner"" is his partner, a female...since they can get more work...I guess he has to dumb down the engineering practice as well...well in that case I might have a chance....Actually he spoke very highly of his partner.  Anyway by observing how he acted around people, and just talking to him for 2 hours, there is no way I could work for the guy, I would be around him for 40 hours a week nearly.  Not to mention since it's a startup company, he won't be able to provide the benefits that other companies can or probably coudln't pay a comparable salary.  He did mention, that there may be some paycheck ""glitches"" and that it may not be as a big a deal for me since I'm not married or anything.  I appreciate his honesty, but I don't feel like missing paychecks.  Needless to say, I won't be taking this job, I may e-mail him and just see if he would give me a decent offer.  

This morning, my interview was with McKim and Creed in Cary.  A couple friends of mine knew a guy that worked there.  First impression of the company, the secretary was very nice, and Grant, the person that interviewed me, was a nice guy.  I felt good about this company.  The interview lasted an hour.  He already indicated that he would beat any offer that was made, definite plus.  However, he is still interviewing 4 other people for the job...He asked if I had any CAD experience...unfortunately I did not.  He said it wasn't required, but I immediately felt my chances of landing the job drop.  He told me that if they are interested in me, I would have to go through one or two more interviews.  He would let me know by the end of the week if they would grant me another interview.  Hopefully I will get another interview, as this is easily my best option as of right now.  

What the decision boils down to...do I take a sure thing right now, or do I wait it out and take something in Raleigh?  The cons of moving to Richmond include the moving hassle, the fact I'll have to have a single apartment, utitlity bills will be by myself, and I'd have to eventually buy furniture and entertainment stuff...though I may not get cable, my time could be better spent reading, playing music instead of mindless vegging in front of the boob tube.  The pros with Richmond, my good friend Dan works with, Darin-the guy that would be my boss seems like a great guy, and I had a great feeling walking into the place, it felt like a good fit, and it's a sure thing.  I've heard good things about the Richmond area.  I'll probably visit the area this weekend, since I believe I owe it to myself to at least check it out...if I don't go, I'll probably decline the offer.  Perhaps going and experiencing a new city may bring some excitement into my life and may be needed.  Fresh start may do some good things for me, ya never know.  A week ago I was all for moving up to Richmond, feeling like I need to get out, get a new start, experience new things meet people...life seemed to be getting stagnant.  What I didn't count on were people telling me they wished I'd stick around that they'd miss me, that makes it 10x harder to think of moving.  So pretty much it's back and forth, move not move...and so on.  A balancing act between old ground and new frontier, sure thing vs. waiting it out.  One thing I'm trying to avoid is that whole ""You must get a job immediately or you're a failure.""  I have a good friend remind me of that, ""The world isn't going to end if I don't have a job soon.""  He's right...because my prophetic aunt has me convinced that the world is ending anyways and it's due to some off the wall amalgamation of the Wall Street Jews, Roman Catholic Church, the muslims, Tony Blair and some other key ingredients....but that whole theory's worthy of another entry...-^sarcasm by the way (i think some of what she says is a bit loopy)....Anyway point being, if I don't land a job next week, world's not over, which always makes me think of the fear and consumption theory that Michael Moore used and what Trey Parker was saying...if you don't succeed right away you're not going to amount to anything other than a failure.  So I try to look past that, realize there are plenty of opportunites in this area if that's where I want to be, and I'll patiently apply to more jobs....or I'll take the sure thing....this decision hasn't bothered me til today, but it sure is stressing me out a bit right now.

So basically, I have no idea what I'm going to do.  But here I am, if I'm lucky enough to live a century, or perhaps unlucky enough...being that old is unfathomable to me now...I've used up nearly a quarter of my life.  It's an interesting part of my life, having complete freedom (well except for that built up college debt) but uncertain where I will be and what I'll be doing a month from now.  Both scary and at the same time exciting...it's all about perspective, but best way to deal with it I suppose is to welcome both.  
I'll even quote John Mayer, who for the record I believe is a brilliant songwriter, lyricist and a heckuva guitar player...I mean ever hear him do the Stevie Ray and Wes Montgomery stuff, and damn he has some nice tone out of that strat...he just sometimes sings wussy songs and has that annoying breathy voice, but I actually can now enjoy some of his songs in somewhat small doses...I now am less embarassed to admit it now too.  
'Welcome to the real world', she said to me
Condescendingly
' Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white'

So I guess that's it...I'm plotting out the rest of my life in the real world, setting myself up for a life of working everyday, however I promise not to subject myself to a life I don't enjoy, the second I realize I don't enjoy my work...it'll be off to something else, owning a business perhaps, or pursuing my passion for music, who knows...




Here's something I borrowed from a friend's wesbite...truly insightful piece into what it's like to be in your 20's....

			Being Twenty-Something

 

They call it the ""Quarter-life Crisis."" It is when you stop going along

with the crowd and start realizing that there are a lot of things about

yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure

and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because

you barely know where you are now. You start realizing that people are

selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close

to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met and the people you

have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you do not

realize is that they are realizing that too and are not really cold or

catty or mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you.

 

You look at your job. It is not even close to what you thought you would

be doing or maybe you are looking for one and realizing that you are going

to have to start at the bottom and are scared. You miss the comforts of

college, of groups, of socializing with the same people on a constant

basis. But then you realize that maybe they weren't so great after all.

You are beginning to understand yourself and what you want and do not

want.

 

Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find

yourself judging a bit more than usual because suddenly you realize that

you have certain boundaries in your life and add things to your list of

what is acceptable and what is not. You are insecure and then secure. You

laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and

scared and confused. Suddenly change is the enemy and you try and cling on

to the past with dear life but soon realize that the past is drifting

further and further away and there is nothing to do but stay where you are

or move forward. You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you

loved could do such damage to you or you lay in bed and wonder why you

can't meet anyone decent enough to get to know better. You love someone

but maybe love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you

are not a bad person. You go through the same emotions and questions over

and over and talk with your friends about the same topics because you

cannot seem to make a decision. You worry about loans and money and the

future and making a life for yourself and while winning the race would be

great, right now you'd just like to be a contender! What you may not

realize is that everyone reading this relates to it. We are in our best of

times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this

whole thing out."

"event","Well tomorrow is the start of a new year, 2005.  So what does that mean?  It means we can all get drunk, party and be merry because it is the start of the new year, well according to our calendar devised from I believe Roman times.  So practically it's an excuse to not go to work and get drunk.  
Turn on the TV, what I see...I can't belive the news today...Killer waves, tsunamis ravaging Asia and Africa.  I mean when in the world's existence has something along the lines over 100,000 people dying have ever happened.  Not very often.  9.0 earthquake unheard of.  150 killed in Argentina.  Iraqi war.  Oh yeah and on VH1, the channel that indulges the whims of celebrity life, Paris Hilton is the #2 person of the year or something like that.  We are living in troubled times, that's for sure.  I don't need tele-evangelsitic bible prophets to tell me that.

Well, not everyday does the troubles of the world bother me, but today it's gotten to me.  Watching the scenes in Asia just really got to me...Just to see that many people suffering, people dying, people losing loved ones.  Their lives will forever be affected.  The magnitude of mother nature is quite humbling, the power and unpredictable nature, who's going to be hit next?...So what is going through my head?  ""Watching those videos ruined my day!  Now I'm not in a good mood.""  And here comes the onslaught of guilt that comes with being an American with a conscience.  These people are going through very hard times, and all I can think about is, well that ruined my day.  hmmm I'm going to lay down and escape from the horrendous pictures on the television screen.  Guilt and being selfish and the comforting feel of an American.  That's how I feel...I guess tonight I'm going to forget about it all, and celebrate.  So what am I celebrating?  The new year, the passing of an old year?  Nah, just celebrating another excuse to get drunk.  I mean we're over here celebrating, mostly oblivious to what is going on across the oceans, in a drunken stupor.  Don't get me wrong, it'll be great to see old friends and hang out with people I'm close to, it just seems almost inappropriate.  And the guilt thing just keeps getting worse.  Perhaps tomorrow I'll be more numb to it, I'm sure the way I'm feeling now isn't permanent.  However I do know it's hard having a conscience and not being totally ignorant to the world.  Feels like the weight of the world falls on your shoulders, but what am I supposed to do?  
I turn to VH1, and their excessive celebration of the American celebrity.  It is totally disgusting.  The cultural and social vacuum that I'm subjected to by the media.  I don't need the media to remind me of what a wasteland this country's become...totally cynical view, I think highly of many of the accomplishments, but am thoroughly disgusted with the direction things are going each passing day.  Well I guess I'll get away from this, I'm getting bummed out...hmmm maybe I'll watch a movie or something."

"event","Tired so gonna make this short....Tons of stuff has happened lately but I'll just talk about today.  I went for my job interview at a civil engineering firm up in Richmond, Virginia.  Everything went well and I expect I'll get an offer soon.  The people that worked there seemed alright and I liked the guy that interviewed me.  Relocating to Richmond might be tough.  I don't really have anything holding me back or tying me down, but it's tough to leave everything behind and move to unfamiliar territory.  I do know a couple of people up there at least.
Got back into Raleigh at about 2 or so today.  Worked out at Carmichael and got back here in time to listen to the Allman Bros recreation of Eat A Peach.  The current incarnation of the band recorded live in the studio their classic for XM radio.  I ordered the 3 day free trial XM radio.
The Eat A Peach show was one of the greatest pieces of music I've ever heard.  Opening with Ain't Wasting Time No More and they go into Les Brers in A Minor....oh man it smoked.  Everything was so awesome, especially Mountain Jam, Little Martha, and Blue Sky.  Gregg sounded awesome.  It's just great hearing just the band, no crowd.  Oteil sounded awesome, Marc sounded great on percussion, and Derek and Warren were phenomenal on guitar.  Derek played some awesome stuff on Mountain Jam.  Melissa was a bit subpar though.
I am really considering getting XM radio, perhpas for my car.  I thought with all my CDs I wouldn't need it, but there's always so much good stuff on there.  There's a station called Real Jazz that plays just great stuff all the time as well as a Blues station called Bluesville....alright time to bed."

"event","After being a longtime subscriber to Guitar World, well from 9th grade to 12th grade and a somewhat occasional reader in college, my interest dwindled as I became less interested in mainstream rock, I knew who Dimebag was.  He always was raved by the readers, and deversedly so.  The guy could friggin rip up solos and came up with the some of the heaviest riffs ever.  If I was a metalhead, I think Pantera would've been my favorite band.  Vinnie Paul's drums, Phil's voice, and Dimebag was a heckuva guitar player.  With that said...here's some sad news.  And on the same day John Lennon was shot, not that I would ever compare the 2, it's just a bit of a coincidence.  

5 Killed In Ohio Nightclub Shooting
Witnesses: Alleged Gunman Went Onto Stage, Fired Shots

POSTED: 10:32 pm EST December 8, 2004
UPDATED: 12:36 am EST December 9, 2004
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- At least five people died and two others were wounded after a shooting at a Columbus, Ohio, nightclub on Wednesday night, television station WCMH reported.

The shooting took place shortly after 10 p.m. at Alrosa Villa, located at 5055 Sinclair Road.

Two members of the heavy metal band Damageplan were reportedly shot and killed, including Dimebag Darrell, formerly with the band Pantera, WCMH reported. The other band member's name was not released. The alleged gunman also died at the scene, Wayne reported.

Shortly after the band began playing its first song, a man reportedly ran onto the stage and began shooting, according to a witness who identified himself as Sean. Some members of the audience reportedly thought the man running onto the stage with a gun was part of the band's act, the TV station reported.

Witnesses said that several shots were fired at the band. Witnesses said that a bouncer at the club tackled the alleged gunman before that person was shot and killed. It was unclear as to whom shot the alleged gunman.

WCMH reported that of the surviving victims, one person was in critical condition while the other was in fair condition. Several others were treated at the scene, suffering from various injuries.

Alrosa Villa is a popular north Columbus nightspot for young adults, featuring rock and heavy metal bands, WCMH reported.

According to the band's Web site, Damageplan was touring nationally. It performed in Buffalo, N.Y., on Tuesday night and had a concert scheduled in Flint, Mich., on Thursday.

Damageplan featured former Pantera artists Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul. The pair were joined by vocalist Patrick Lachman and bassist Bobzilla, according to their Web site. 

Pantera - ""Hollow""

What's left inside him?
Don't he remember us?
Can't he believe me?
We seemed like bothers
Talked for hours last month
About what we wanna be
I sit now with his hand in mine
But I know he can't feel...

No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead

I'm close with his mother
And she cries endlessly
Lord how we miss him
At least what's remembered
It's so important to make best friends in life
But it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressions

No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead

He as hollow as I alone now
He as hollow as I alone
A shell of my friend
Just flesh and bone
There's no soul
He sees no love
I shake my fists at skies above
Mad at God

He as hollow as I converse
I wish he'd waken from this curse
Hear my words before it's through
I want to come in after you
My best friend

He as hollow as I alone"

"event","Last week I finished my senior design project, did my two presentations for it.  On Thursday after my final presentation, I started studying for my FE Exam.  On Friday I went to class, studied for the FE and went to Pullen Park and tried to vote.  Since I'm registered 3 hoursa way I sent for an absentee ballot.  My absentee ballot didn't ever come so I was told by a couple of friends I could go to the Pullen Park poll, located on NCSU campus, and vote.  I went to the board of elections site and it said they had early voting and absentee voting.  Well we thought, yeah we can vote we're voting absentee.  My roommate and I waited 2 hours, got in, and they told us we couldn't vote.  We asked a few other people working because it seemed so obviously stated on the website we could vote.  Nope didn't let us vote.  We were pretty mad to say the least about it.  I was going to vote Kerry and he would've voted Bush, so I suppose our votes would have cancelled each other.  
I found out later from some other friends that they saw someone the day before we voted able to vote and he was registered elsewhere, the polling place changed his registration.  
Later that day, Senator Edwards placed his vote at Pullen Park.  Link:  http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/041029/480/ncsd10210292318

Saturday took the FE...very hard.  8 excruciating hours of standardized testing, I hope I passed.  Get home, find out we lost to Clemson in football, pretty disappointing.  Also worth noting: Fla State lost to Maryland, and then Miami lost to Carolina....everything was backwards.  Then the next day Denver loses to Atlanta.  Not a good weekend for my football teams.  At least my fantasy team won, I'm still tied with one other for first place.  

Today's the big day, election day.  And it's pretty much the first election I've really cared about.  All I can hope is that Bush isn't re-elected."

"event","Weekend-bars, lost in football to Miami, Mon night- Denver lost to Cincy...not good football weekend for me.

This week has been dedicated entirely to my senior design project.  We've been working on it all semester.  Tuesday we gave our presentation in front of the class to be critiqued by our peers and our professor.  Tomorrow we're presenting to a nearby town's mayor and city council members, to see if they like our proposed plan for their town.  We finished our report tonight.  The report is bound professionally thanks to  the nearby Kinko's. The report is over 40 pages.  Tomorrow's presentation is around 20 mintues, then we'll be asked some questions.  I expect some of them to be pretty tough, but I think we'll handle it.  
My album of the moment- Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde.  One of his earlier albums, it's a definite masterpiece if I've ever heard one.  Good stuff!!!  Got to wake up tmr, get some dress clothes, and do this presentation stuff."

"event","Clock says 12:32...32 minutes past midnight.  So it's late Monday night (it's not officially Tuesday til I wake up tmr)  We are hosting ESPN College Gameday on Friday and Saturday...yup Corso, Herbstreit and the gang are hosting the NCState Miami game!!!  I better get a winning voucher tmr...NC State finally got the monkey off its back by beating Maryland.  Man I hate Maryland!  My fantasy football team won by .17 points, which keeps me tied for first place.  Broncos won convincingly against our arch nemesis the Raiders.  Yankees are in the World Series...yup again.  That cursed Bambino.

BBC News is reporting: A US company has been given the green light to implant microchips in humans. It's intended to provide medical information ... but will it turn into a surveillance system?  
http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3742684.stm?dynamic_vote=ON#vote_3742684
Not only is this an infringement on our privacy, it's pretty damn scary and apocalyptic.  The cons definitely outweigh the benefits.  1984, Big Brother...yup this is the stuff my 10th Grade History teacher would tell us about, Big Brother government taking over.

School's gonna be hectic the next few weeks.  My senior project presentation and reports are due....I'll be sure to talk about that later, got a presentation Wed.  and I have a memo about best management practices due Thursday in my sr. project class.  I just want to graduate and land myself a job.  Make some money and figure out where I'm going in life.  I wanna stay in the Raleigh area.  I would like to experience the world and move around, but I know too many people that miss all their friends and loved ones when they're away.  A favorite artist of mine in high school once said:
 ""Turns out not where but who you're with that really matters.""  
Seems to be true.

Not really sure what else to write about...Still haven't heard from Tara, oh well...I might try and get in touch with her if I go down to Wilmington, it's not something I need to worry about now.  
I was asked why I wasn't a music major a couple days ago, I'm sure that'd be more enjoyable, not really sure what kinda career path that would yield to.  Though possibly something like sound engineering or along those lines might've been cool.  Oh well...I have less than 3 months before I graduate with that Environmental Engineering degree...it's worth something, just not sure what just yet.  Just so I get a job, make enough money for myself (money's not really a big issue) and am happy overall.  Speaking of which, I need to work on getting that job thing.  NOW.  
It's 12:46, means time for bed.  Set my alarm for 9. Gonna get up, run about 3 miles, do my ab workout, and hopefully get a little work done tmr.  Got class from 1-5 tmr.  More classes, but just 3 more months of em.  Probably in a year, I'll be wishing I had more classes.  Guess that's how it goes...ready for school to be over!!!!  Bed."

"event","Today I called to make sure that I was registered to vote for this year's election.  Found out I was registered in Burke County, which I really haven't resided in 5 years...gotta change it to Raleigh or wherever I'm living next elections.  I'll be voting absentee ballot.
This'll be my first time ever voting.  People had been pressing me to vote this election, but I never felt strong to vote until the past month.  Couple nights ago it was bugging me that I might not be able to vote, so it's good to know that I'll be able to add 1 vote to the millions being cast.
I watched the first and tonight's debate.  The first debate was extremely repetitive as they only discussed the war.  
This debate covered more ground.  I don't consider myself very political, or knowledgable about the political process, but I feel as though I'm more sure of who I'm going to vote for.  To me there's just way too many things going on...too many interests, too much money involved, and just too much history and stuff going on behind closed doors for me to ever really get a true grasp of what's going on.  
My take on everything...This country's screwed.  I'm by no means an expert on any of this, but I feel that our foreign policy and how we handle circumstances towards other countries is totally wrong.  And with Bush, he seems to embody every bit of this attitude that I believe other countries perceive us.  Our arrogance, being stubborn, our refusal to compromise, our attitude that we only do what benefits ourselves economically, the fact that we have military personnel stationed in nearly every corner of the earth.  Bush is not entirely to blame, it's our imperialistic means that have been going on for a couple of centuries.  
Bush rejects the Kyoto Protocol several years ago.  This is not a way to lead nations.  We're a country that pollutes 25% of the world's pollution, yet Bush refueses to follow the Kyoto environmental guidelines...and then we're going to tell developing countries that they can't pollute, they can't become industrialized.  Bush invades Iraq to free the Iraqi people, force them into democracy..isn't democracy based on the freedom of people?  We're fighting the war on terror?  Didn't we create the war on terror?  Isn't it from all the shady business in the Mid East, the fact we've given weapons to Osama and Iran, trained other countries to overtake their leaders for our own economic interest, the fact that we exploit Middle Eastern oil for our own economy.  This is why people try to strike fear into our country, into our government.  Hatred for america isn't inept...It's a reaction to our ways.

Anyway the debate....In the first debate Bush says it's not a war of religion.  Tonight he states that after praying to our God, he decided to fight Iraq.  It is our job through God to free the Iraqis, that's what God wants, but is that what Allah and the Mid East want?  I just hate that we force our will onto all these countries.  Guess it's manifest destiny all the way.  We conquered the Indians, let's conquer the Muslims next.  Once we start democracy there, we can begin a 21st century Crusades and convert all of them to Christianity.  
Kerry made tons of promises...health care benefits, social security, lower taxes....Both candidates were quick to throw statistics for everything and projections.  These statistics mean nothing to me, I can't comprehend this stuff, and I'm no economist I can't understand all these plans...I'll leave that to Greenspan.  seems really far fetched to me.  I've already accepted the fact I won't have social security when I retire.  From what i nkow it was designed by FDR in post war times, could be wrong, and might just not be suitable later.  
When Bush was asked about what to do about jobs....jobs going to other countries...His response was education.  Send every kid to college.  Right??  Not every kid is going to be able to go to college.  But I guess you'd alienate much of the country if ya tell them that they're not smart enough to earn a trade or go to college.  Bush also said that he'd hire an immigrant to work, but only if tehre wasn't an American to do the work.  Yeah...I'm sure Bush would hire an American for $8 bucks an hour to drill oil over $5.50 or less for a Mexican.  
Health care...I believe Kerry said something about countries that had their governments control their health care were unsuccessful.  I'm pretty sure Canada and the Scandinavian countries are doing quite alright...though I could be wrong on that.  And Kerry says everyone's gonna get health care.  That's pretty dandy.  His logic...get people going to the hospital sooner, they will detect health problems earlier, thus being less minor and costing the country less.  He also mentioned twice that he has Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Wahoo I do too!  He said something about every person getting the same health coverage that Congressmen get.  So what's that supposed to mean?  Bush replies that it would be impossible. 
Over the 1 1/2 hour discussion, I was disappointed there was no talk of the environment.  Just seems to me that the protection of our resources and the environment is much of the future of the world.  I can't believe there wasn't one bit of discussion on it.  Guess it shows what the priorites are.  Once our resources are depleted and we're fighting wars over potable water, it'll be an issue.  I'm not a tree hugging save the whale person, but I feel that environmental issues should be a more important topic.

with all this said, I think it's safe to say I'm voting Kerry this election.  I don't vote republican or democrat...I just go with gut feeling and what issues are more important.

Gone to bed..."

"event","""The day"" came and passed.  I'd been waiting for several months for the Allman Brothers show.  Having 2nd row seats only quadrupled the anticipation.  I knew I was in for quite a show and wasn't disappointed...well not with the Allmans anyway.  

I met my friend Brett on 6 Forks, ate some food and then headed to Walnut Creek.  We get parked....2 seconds later someone muttered something to his friends about Brett's sticker advertising John Kerry.  The guy was wearing a ""Osama Wants You to Vote for Kerry"" T-shirt. I had to bite my lip from saying ""We also have 2nd row seats!""  We wasted no time in the parking lot and headed for the venue.  We actually heard people yelling Bush propaganda in the parking lot.  Walking through the parking lot, it was evident this isn't the typical Allman crowd.  This crowd was rowdier, yelled ""Get r done"" at any given chance, and were just plain redneck.  It wasn't hard to spot who came to see Skynyrd, oh yeah Skynyrd opened I forgot, and who came to see the Allmans.  I always knew there was some sort of a rift between Allman fans and Skynyrd fans...I always thought it was something more of my imagination, that I exaggerated it a bit...but in fact walking through the crowd solidified my belief there's a cultural difference.  

We get to our seats, there was an opener playing acoustic guitar and singing, I had no idea there would be someone playing before Skynyrd.  I get to my seat...could not believe it...it was like I was dreaming...""Damn I'm close!!!""  2nd row seats, right in the middle!  We're about 10 feet away from the stage.  

It was obvious most of the people around me were here to see Skynyrd.  The 3 guys turned around to talk to us...they seemed like nice people but...one had about 2 half teeth, so I'll say he had one tooth, the other two had these cowboyish hats, one with a skynyrd bandana around it...they're teeth weren't pretty.  I couldn't believe it.  Right in front of me was your true stereotypical Skynyrd fan.  

At around 7 Lynyrd Skynyrd was to come out.  I decided beforehand I was going to enjoy this to my best ability and not be too judgmental of the band.  Before they came out, they played some redneck cartoon about a guy that was named Dog the Bounty Hunter, I actually think it's going to be a TV show soon.  Anyway it was dumb as hell.  I thought I was at a WWF wrestling match or something along the lines.  Such cheesy introductions.  The guys came out exactly like on their One More From the Road CD...playing verbatim Working For the MCA and I Ain't the One.  I admit being 2 rows away from them playing these songs was a bit of a rush.  I don't consider myself a hardcore Skynyrd fan but they did write some great songs when Ronnie Van Zandt was in the band, something which obviously this version of Skynyrd knows.  They do several songs and I hear something similar to the drum intro my favorite Skynyrd tune ""I Know a Little.""  Well this band does the song with too much distortion and not enough swing...I didn't enjoy it too much.  This was about 45 minutes into the show and I was bored out of my mind.  The 3 guitars meshed together sounding much like a train wreck and they played all their songs verbatim.  Ronnie's little brother, the singer, kept yelling out crap like ""How Ya doing Raleigh-Durham"" and who's some real ""Skynyrd fans?""  They yelled the Raleigh thing at least 6 or 7 times.  One of their guitarist Ricky Medlocke did everything he could to pump up the crowd, but it was pretty corny in my opinion.  The show looked so rehearsed and overdone...sure it looked like they were having fun.  I mean how many videos of former members of Skynyrd can you have.  How many times can you pay homage to your country and the military and really mean it sincerely.  Oh yeah the rebel flag crap started coming up halfway into the set.  My opinion of Skynyrd show, entertaining, cheesey, some decent guitar work, some not so decenet guitar work, and at times a sloppy sounding show.  To say the least I wasn't impressed by their gimmicks and all their talking about their glory days when they had Collins, Gaines, and Ronnie was singing.  I thought several times during the show Ronnie must be rolling in his grave.  It was quite a disgrace.  They finally did Sweet Home Alabama and Freebird...whew!!! that's finally over....Let's bring some real music.

An older guy next to us during the set break asked us who we came to see.  He was wearing a Allman shirt, and he definitely could sense we were there for the Allmans.  I rapped with him a while as he'd first seen the Allmans in the early 70s.  He had seen them 12 times this year.  He talked about meeting all the guys, even Gregg Allman this year, talked about the archivist Kirk West and some other cool stories over the years.  We asked how he could get off work to see the Allmans.  He said he's paid his dues and he travels a lot for work and plans his travels over seeing concerts.  

Finally 9:00 hits and the Allmans start.  I think there are about 5 people in front of me, about 20,000 behind me...man what a feeling...Man!!!  I'm right in front of Warren Haynes and Oteil Burbridge.  They come out and quite a few people are gone.  They start things off by playing Statesboro Blues, Warren on slide.  Immediately the Allmans sound great.  The sound meshes...I was worried by how bad Skynyrd sounded that I was in a bad spot...nope it was just Skynyrd that sounded bad themselves.  It was apparent how more professional the Allmans sounded.  After seeing Skynyrd play first, I have an even higher appreciation for the Brothers, if that was even possible.

Halfway through the show, Gregg says something along the lines ""here's a song that we've gotten requested a few times.""  The guy next to me said it's gonna be ""Blue Sky.""  I told him no way!  I'll bet $100 right now that it's not Blue Sky. See I knew that they hadn't played Blue Sky since Dickey Betts was kicked out of the band back in 1999.  I knew there was no way Gregg Allman would ever sing a Dickey Betts tune at an Allmans show.  Never happening.

The next song turned out to be....Blue Sky!!!  I could not friggin' believe it.  I felt like I was witnessing a huge part of their history.  You could see the shock in the Allmans fans, no one saw this one coming...well except for the guy next to me.  I had to text message Rick Lollar to let him know Blue Sky.  When Gregg started singing the song after Derek and Warren's solos I had to call and let him hear it on the cell.  Yeah I never take out my cell phone during a concert, but this was history in the making...I had to let the guy hear it.  Wow incredible.  

Here's the setlist from the show.  Note they also did Les Brers, could also be the first time doing that song in a long time.  I found out after the show they did Blue Sky at the Fox Theatre a week or so ago, I dont know how I didn't hear about it.  I did pick up the Instant Live CD of the show...I am listening to last night's show right this second!  I could go in depth and analyze each song but I gotta get ready for the game.  Short notes...I didn't hear any teases in any of the solos.  Typically derek, warren and oteil put in teases, maybe I just missed them.  Oteil was playing unbelieveable last night.  What tone!!!  He makes a bass sound beautiful.  He went crazy on Southbound.  He was definitely feeling it last night and enjoying himself.  It was a ""Warren"" night, Derek didn't play like he does sometimes, but it was still great!!!  No special guests.  My first time hearing Hoochie Coochie Man, Night They Drove old Dixie Down, Blue Sky!!!, Midnight Rider, Les Brers in A Minor, Stormy Monday.

After the show I headed to the Lincoln Theatre.  As I walked in I see a guy walking to the bar I recognized.  It was Paul the guitarist from Scrapomatic.  I told him how much I dug their stuff and really enjoyed their set at New Year's Eve and that I hated to miss them, but I was late getting back from the Allmans concert.  I got there for the Yonrico Scott Band.  The second song they do was ""Out of the Madness"" a song off Derek Trucks's first album.  They also later on did Lookout 31 off Derek Trucks Band's Joful Noise CD.  Todd Smallie told me afterwards it was only the 3rd or so time doing that song.
The scrapomatic guys come out with YSB and do Back at the Chicken Shack->Ain't That Loving You, I Believe, Moanin', and then a funk song.
Todd really laid down some awesome bass licks.  I was impressed as always.  Not having Derek around let Kofi, Rico, and Todd really shine.  It was great seeing what these guys were capable of.  Derek's amp was at the Lincoln, buddha and all, turned on and ready to go. He never made it though.  The roadie Joe Main remembered me from the House of Blues show and talked to me for a bit.  
After the show Todd came up and talked to us.  My friend George got his cell # for bass lessons for when he goes down to Georgia.  As always, Todd was a super cool guy.  Yonrico also came up to us and thanked us for coming out. Well quite a night!  I bought the YSB cd and talked to Paul a bit after the show.  

Today....heading to see the Pack play Wake Forest!!!  Man I wanna go to the Allmans show in Charlotte tonight!!!  I'm considering it!"

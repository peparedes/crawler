Yeah, I know, not that big of a surprise--maybe. 

I wish I could be more like Harry Kim. Harry's not like me, well, not really, because he's...

Responsible and dedicated and he follows orders like a good little soldier and...

He just seems to have more things together than I do. <i>He</i> wouldn't have lied about...he follows orders and acts like a Starfleet poster child. Acts like maybe he should more often than I do.

Sometimes, when we're in some life-threatening situation, or when I'm in hot water with Captain Janeway because I've done something stupid again, or when I think back to <i>that</i> day, I think that Harry would handle this differently, and that he'd be the kind of person my father would have wanted for a son.

Sometimes."

Danger? What does danger mean to me right now?

Funny you should ask that....

Lately it seems that everyone's been trying to shoot me. Hostile aliens making threats against me (not that there's anything strange or new with that one), people hunting me down and shoving me in jail when I swear I didn't do anything this time (Again, not so strange...), people from the past trying to blow my head off (and managing to destroy this beautifully sweet ride in the process...)

And yeah, that's gotta be the worst. When you're flung back in time to try and <i>fix</i> something and people are <i>still</i> trying to blow you up. They missed, which is good for me and bad for the Ford, but that's not the point. Point is, we're in danger right now, and I'm not...

I don't have a plan. I mean, I have a plan, but it might not work. 

Bad things could happen. Understatement of the century, but it's true. Correct me if I'm wrong, but we have a real shot at destroying the world here, don't we? That whole time-space continuum thing...yeah, we're messing with the first half of that. 

Sure, <i>he</i> messed with it first, (well, really <i>they</i>, Braxton and Starling) but we're not in a position to go running to mommy and scream, ""He started it!"" I don't care how often Harry does that and how many times it's worked for him, it just won't work here.

In a way, this new danger presents some really excellent opportunities. We could rid the world of horrible evils like the Third World war, famine, rampant disease, new math....

But if we mess up, even a little bit, the world as we know it will cease to exist. No more Starfleet, no more <i>Voyager</i>, no more B'Elanna and Harry and the captain.

We've got to do something about it. I don't care how much I hate new math and the plague, failure is just not an option here.

I think the biggest danger is losing everything I've grown to respect and honor. Everything I, ""hold dear,"" as the saying goes. 

That means a hell of a lot to me, but I can't find the words for it."

"event","Dealing with a situation that is my responsibility. There's more than one way to look at that. Things that I'm in charge of, and things that are my fault. 
Voyager and things are slow right now. Really slow. Like...so slow that I'm tempted to take up the captain's offer and go clean the warp plasma filters. 

Tempted, but still not going to, even if that did mean I'd get to spend the day near B'Elanna.

So. A situation I'm that is my responsibility.

I'm having a really hard time coming up with something.

Okay, okay, before someone says that this is because I refuse to take responsibility for anything... It's not that. Well, it might have a little something to do with that, but it's not. I mean it. It's...

Okay, so I'm a little bit negilgent on that whole responsibility thing, but that's all right. Right? 

Yeah? 

Maybe not.

No, no, that can't be it. I'm a responsible person. I pilot the ship! That time that Chakotay was off prancing around and getting in touch with his spiritual side while we were spiraling down in a whirling vortex of death--yeah, I had responsibility there. Granted, I wouldn't have had it for very long, but it was my job to keep us alive for as long as I could, and we made it.

"event","Personal Log, Lieutenant Tom Paris, stardate...uh....five one one...Um...computer, insert stardate marker to this entry. 

<b>[LCARS: REQUEST>ADDENDUM>STARDATE>INDEX: 51175.35]</b>

So. I woke up in sickbay a few minutes ago, strapped to some machine that looked like it was supposed to suck out my brain through a straw. Turns out (surprise, surprise,) that B'Elanna and I are suffering from the effects of severe oxygen depravation after our, ""little spacewalking stint,"" which Doc keeps muttering about under his breath, and to make us <i>really</i> tipsy he decided to bypass Tri Ox injections and just infuse the oxygen directly to our hemoglobin. 

What a treat; twice the fun with half the wait. We were fairly fine when <i>Voyager</i> beamed us back, but the Doc had other ideas and we both ended up so drugged I'm surprised I'm able to talk. If I'm even doing it right now. Right, now. *snorts* Great.

Anyway, I know, it's not really all that surprising we got stuck like this. I thought ejecting the warp core was the lowest point of any day. 

I'm an idiot for <i>thinking</i> that, much less actually having the nerve to say it. 

Never tempt Fate, Tommy Boy. Especially not over a smartass comment. Fate is a lot more sarcastic than you are, and she's not afraid to let you know it in the worst possible way.

Still, for this day being so lousy, we actually got pretty lucky. If <i>Voyager</i> had taken thirty more seconds to show up, we would have been floating space trash. 

And yeah, the Doc likes mutter about that, too. 

For a little bit, after I first woke up, I couldn't even remember why the hell I was in sickbay. I kept mumbling about being late with a conn report. Doc was patient though, and I started to remember what happened. It seems I got the worst end of the stick, and it took me longer to come around than it took B'Elanna. B'El's Klingon physiology made it easier for her to withstand the effects of oxygen depravation, and uh...when I was playing around with the oxygen ratios, I made sure hers would last a little longer than mine would. In case it...well, because...because I did, that's all. 

Apart from our typical near-death experience, something new happened. 

B'Elanna said she loved me. 

It was right before we would have...before the oxygen was nearly gone. We were both struggling to breathe and she...just said it. She said she had to tell me the truth, and she told me she loved me. And she might have meant it. But she might not have. I want her to have meant it, but if she didn't mean it then I don't want her to, because I'm tired of trying to make her understand what she doesn't want to understand. So if she doesn't, then I don't, but if she does, then I really, really do, even though it's not exactly how I would have had this planned.  

I can't make up my damn mind! We were dying; she might have said it because no one deserves to die alone, or because she was hallucinating. 

God, she could have been thinking of Chakotay when she said it, for all I know. I can't seem to stop thinking that she meant it, but she probably didn't, so I don't--

What? Aw, hell, not again, Doc! Can't a guy get the non-drowsy version of whatever that stuff is? I'm tired of sleeping; it's boring. *grumbles* No, you do not need to call Captain Janeway down here. *sighs in defeat* No, I am not being immature. Fine.

I...so, we were out, and B'Elanna was saying that she loved me, and I'm not sure...what I just said. I want to finish this before...I...fall...

I mean, come on! It is like the ultimate substance in the galaxy. You can pack it, roll it, throw it, mold it, melt it, fluff it around, flop down in it, schwoosh around on it, bury someone in it, pour water on it and make ice, eat it, write in it--it's like God's gift to children and immature adults everywhere. 

It is amazing, and I wish we lived somewhere near more snow so I would have an excuse to go snowboarding and snowmobiling.

"event","I...Alright, I'm not really ready to commit to one being forever yet. No, it's not because I'm not housebroken or I want a girl on every planet (although I wouldn't <i>mind</i>...um. You know, forget that.) It has nothing to do with that. It's because I haven't found her yet.

That sounds fairly reasonable, and it's the truth. I haven't found the woman who completes me, makes me feel whole, makes me feel alive, and all that. Sure, in the end, love is a many splendored thing and all you need is love, but the real question is can anybody find me somebody to love, because I'm addicted to love, any love. *realizes people will end up staring blankly at him if they read this* 

They're old Terran songs. I'm making an analogy. With love songs. Yah, forget it. The point is, I haven't found that special other person to share the rest of my long, long, long, long, long...long...long life with here in the big Delta Quadrant away from every form of civilization any of us has ever known.

Alright? Is that so hard to believe?

*looks left and right* 

Okay, maybe it should be. I'm lying.

I have found her, and I am ready to <i>begin</i> a commitment with her, she just...doesn't know it yet. 

So...that makes sense. Right? 

I'm ready, and technically we're together, just not in that way and not quite like that and it's all very, very complicated. You see, she's my friend, so technically she loves me in a <i>friendly</i> way, but she just doesn't show it so well. And there was this one time when she wanted me like actually wanted me, (I knew that, because she bit me on the face...again, I said it was complicated) but then she didn't and I...it didn't go over so well.

She keeps pushing me away, and I keep coming back because she's so. damn. amazing.

*shrugs*

Still, one day I plan to let her know. With any luck, it won't be on anyone's death bed or last day of existence or anything like that, but it'll be the right time. 

*pauses, and then laughs*

The right time. Who the hell am I kidding? We're in the middle of nowhere on a godforsaken seventy year trip back to a place that half of us didn't really fit in anyway, and would probably be arrested in as soon as we got there, and I'm talking about the right time to confess eternal, undying love and admiration to a woman who not only pushes me away, but constantly calls me a pig and thinks I'm trying to land one or both of the Delaney twins?

There is no goddamn right time!

*growls slightly*

So no. No commitment for me. Yet.

One day, though. One day she'll say she wants me and she'll mean it."

"event","When I was a little kid, I used to dream about what I could do with three wishes. I mean, hey, everybody does that, don't they? 

I'd do that with some of my friends in summer. On a day when it was too hot to play baseball or do anything, we'd sit around with bottles of this sugary pop stuff from Alpha Cent and try to think up wild things to do with three wishes. (Or with Amy Taylor, whichever came first)

And really, whenever we'd do that, you know we only had to come up with two things. The last wish was always for a million wishes, and the first wish of the million was to be reminded when you only had one wish left so you could do it all over again. 

Yeah, we were one smart group of kids. 

We'd come up with things like our own private starship to take us anywhere, or a solar system, or someone to do our homework, or a huge replicator that could make planets, or two Amy Taylor--twice the fun at half the price. *shrugs and grins* When you're twelve years old, you tend to have a one-track mind. 

But then, as I started to grow up (B'Elanna made me), my idea of what could be done with three wishes changed. You could change the entire universe. Right the wrongs. Find a cause and just...fix everything. 

But I know that won't happen. I've lived around this galaxy long enough to know that it'd take a lot more than a Genii and a magic lamp to fix its problems.

So, if I had three wishes, I'd wish for things that I know I can change or accomplish. Things that can be done without a magic wand, and then the guts to actually go do them.

My first wish would be to listen to B'Elanna more, so that I don't do such stupid stuff anymore, and so she'll know I love her. She's just so...great and I never seem to do her justice.

My second wish is to become the kind of father to Miral and Ben that I never had. I know I'm not really firm with them, and I know it tears me up inside when I have to be, but I wish they'd know that, no matter what happens, I love them more than...I don't even know how to say it.

My third wish is...my third wish is stupid. I wish I could take everyone from <i>Voyager</i> on a two week vacation to Risa. 

*shrugs and grins* We could use a vacation."

<i>OOC: After some discussion with my friend B'Elanna, who plays <lj user=""be_lanna"">, we've decided that we're going to develop Tom and B'Elanna's relationship in stages. The first stage is obviously, ""Bad-Ass Half-Klingon Seeks to Kill Annoyingly Cocky Helmboy For His Annoying Cockiness,"" and we've got that covered great. Second stage is, ""Annoyingly Cocky Helmboy Seeks to Date Bad-Ass Half-Klingon Because He Has A Death Wish (Or Just Really Likes Her And Stuff),"" and we're heading there slowly but surely. Third and final stage is, obviously, ""Bad-Ass Half-Klingon and Annoyingly Cocky Helmboy Become Married Couple and Live Somewhat Happily Ever After Despite Their Differences and Arguments And Assorted Bruises."" 

That's the goal. 

When I introduced Tom to the community, it was as post-Endgame!Tom Paris, the Tom with the wife and children and the <strike>32416543216131 piles of junk shoved in his</strike> very full garage and the extended family of about 148 members. That's great, he's great, and don't worry--we'll be back to him. (I know, you were holding your breath in fear, weren't ya? ^_^)

For right now, though, <lj user=""be_lanna""> isn't post-Endgame yet. She's in about the latter part of Star Trek: Voyager's third season, and because of that, I'm going to play Tom from about the viewpoint of Voyager's fourth season, and work with her to develop their relationship to marriage and Miral. 

This ends The Question when it comes to the OMGWTFCASSEROLE confusion! that occurs with having a Tom and a B'Elanna in two different time periods and is actually really great: Everyone likes a little P/T on the side. ^_^

I may occasionally submit an entry as post-Endgame!Tom, and if I do, I'll be sure to let everyone know what's up at the beginning of the entry. Right now, I'm just going at <lj user=""be_lanna"">'s speed, because it's more fun and less confusing for everyone.  

When Tom interacts with Miral (And he will! She's awesome!), it shouldn't be a problem because that author also knows what's going on with Tom and B'Elanna. *grins* 

Thanks for listening! 

Cheers,

It's movie night! 

I've managed to convince a fair part of the crew to show up at the holodeck tonight for a movie. There's going to be popcorn and drinks, romantically flickering near-darkness, people lounging side by side in small theater seating...

Sure, I have to put out for the popcorn and drinks for basically all the senior officers and a few extra people, but I know I'll be getting so much more out of it.

With any luck, I'll win the pool we've got going over Captain Janeway and Commander Chakotay tonight. Did I mention the shared popcorn, drinks, and the <i>romantically flickering near-darkness</i>? I've already worked out a plan with Harry to get the two of them sitting together in their own private row in the veeeeery back, and we've talked a few ensigns into watching them and reporting back to me with updates on any possible...excursions into not-so-familiar, and sometimes not-so-friendly, territory...if you uh, know what I mean.

If the captain and the commander manage to initiate simplistic first contact procedures on this lovely little away mission before midnight, I get to claim three-quarters of the replicator rations in the pool. If the good Commander is able to explore some uncharted virgin territory, hike a few mountains, generally get a good <i>feel</i> for the layout of the land, and maybe even investigate some valleys on his excursion into the unknown, then I win them all. 

All of them. There's over two hundred rations, and I'm dying to get my hands on those. 

Do you have any idea what I could <i>get</i> with that? 

Anyway, it's going to be a blast. 

I invited B'Elanna to come along with me instead of going to dinner, and she agreed to it but made me promise I'd give her twenty-five rations if I won the pool so she can replicate banana pancakes. 

Banana pancakes. I'm on the verge of winning the biggest and most lusted-after pool in all of <i>Voyager</i>--no, in all of <i>Starfleet</i>--history and all she wants of the spoils is banana pancakes. 

*grins* I could replicate half the ship and she wants banana pancakes. 

Well, anyway, the entire thing is all set up and ready for action. I've got the movie picked out, the popcorn replicated, and even the seating chart drawn up and handed out to Ensigns Vorik and Wildman, who have agreed to be ushers for the evening. It's been designed for maximum satisfaction for all involved, and I'm actually quite proud of myself. 

I thought you'd all like to know that Operation: First Contact starts in T minus five minutes, all systems are a <i>go</i> and preliminary precautions have been considered and discarded with my usual amount of discretion and tact. Besides...what could go wrong?

Exactly. It's foolproof. 

And I really should win the pool with this one! Two hundred rations on the date they'd first behave in a manner in accordance with the actions of an accepted humanoid couple in and of their own volition (""Behave in a manner in accordance with the actions of an accepted humanoid couple in and of their own volition."" Pft. Tuvok made me put that in there or he threatened not to bet any of his rations <i>and</i> turn us in to the captain. *rolls eyes* I wanted to say ""until they start going at it like a pair of Academy cadets,"" but noooooo...)

If Chakotay manages to um...apply all thrusters at maximum efficiency and bring it on home, then God only knows what I'll win, but it sure better be half the ship. Neither of them handles sexual tension very well, and it's going to be one hell of a long trip home..."

"event","<i>OOC: I was bored earlier today, so I went back and looked through <lj comm=""trek_blog"">'s past entries and challenges. I saw the challenge for ""Guilty,"" and thought of a very old, very classic joke. So, here's a version of it...Tom Paris style.</i>




Back at the Academy, I had been enrolled in a philosophy class, which is like one of those things that diplomats and future ambassadors and plebes sign up for because they're psyched about....understanding other people, their motivation in life, their worldview and how it effects them, or something like that. Goes with the political psych courses that are also only taken by plebes and future ambassadors (who have and will always act like plebes).

When future Federation starship pilots sign up, it's because they need another credit and picked the easiest-looking class on the options list that didn't interfere with their weekly poker games with the guys from his engineering class...annnnnnnd there was this really stellar blonde who signed up point three milliseconds before said pilot. So, no matter how you want to look at it, I got stuck in a philosophy class. And it wasn't a problem either, because I'd managed to snag a seat next to aforementioned blonde and strike up a really...fascinating discussion concerning socio-political views on sex and relationships. 

We were making some great headway in what I like to consider my own private philosophical independent study unit. In fact, things were going so well, I was a little bummed I didn't have an anatomy class with her. I would have learned a helluva lot more from her than from my professor. 

Right. So I was in philosophy class with the blonde (her name was Samantha, but that doesn't matter) and that means I didn't pay much attention. Why would I when it's a jerk-off class? 

I made it through the course alright, had some help with the homework, and things were going fine. The only thing I wasn't going to have help with was the final exam. 

But my grade was so high in the class anyway, and it was a lousy extra course, I didn't bother to study. 

And that made the results just that much more great.

The professor, this little old ambassador guy, cleared off his whole desk and handed out PADDs to everyone, and then he just plunked this chair down on this desk. He looked at everyone in the room and just said, ""With all the knowledge you've learned in this course, prove that this chair does not exist.""

So, I just wrote, ""What chair? There is no chair,"" on the PADD and handed it in, no worries. I'd fail the final, sure, but I'd pass the course and it wouldn't matter. 

Everyone else worked so hard on that final, writing kilobyte after kilobyte of persuasion and theoretical fact and complex philosophical concepts. It was insanity. I knew there was no way I was going to pass when everyone else put in so much effort.

Three weeks later I find out I got the highest grade that professor's ever given to a philosophy student for that one, smartass answer.

It was years ago and I <i>still</i> feel guilty about that grade..."

"event","Personal Log, Lieutenant Paris, you know the drill...

When this is found along with whatever remains of my remains, I'd like everyone on <i>Voyager</i> to take a listen, just so you all fully understand what it's like to <b>leave</b> people in the middle of <b>nowhere</b> and then come back <b>later</b> to collect their <b> dead bodies</b>. If this is found by someone else, I'd just like to say...go away. 

Now, for the log part of the log.

It seems that I've made an enemy today. 

A big one. 

No, really, I mean it. This enemy is huge. Mind-numbingly large. Gi-normous. Big. (No, I'm not talking about my ego, thank you, B'Elanna).

I've made an enemy with space. 

Space is big. Cold. Dark. It's really quite dark, and I'm not sure I like the dark all that much. 

Darkness leads to claustrophobia. 

Did I ever mention that I'm quasi-claustrophobic?

No? Oh. I suppose it takes death to put things like that into perspective. And I'm only claustrophobic when I know I can't leave the room, area, shuttlecraft of horror and doom...you know how that goes.

For the sake of posterity and Tuvok's curiosity, I'll explain what's working and what's not. Just so you know how I died. 

Fully a quarter of all systems are functioning. The replicator is fine. Emergency backup lights are working, flicking, blinking beautifully. I even have complete thruster control. 

I just don't have a working engine to respond to thruster control. I don't have life support, which means I can't enjoy my beautifully replicated tomato soup in warmth and fresh oxygen. 

To recap that one, engines are offline and I don't have primary or secondary life support. Something from some lesson at the Academy I'm almost sure I didn't pay attention in makes me want to say I'm on something called ""Corpse Keeper"" life support, but that sounds a lot like slang to me.

According to the LCARS readout, which is working, so I'm able to access hundreds of thousands of facts to pass the time as I freeze and/or asphyxiate in the cold darkness of space, the warp drive has been destabilized by an antimatter injector malfunctioning in section seven B nine. 

This caused a cataclysmic (oh, I like that word. Make sure you use it in the eulogy, Harry) breakdown in subspace generation, completely cutting out warp and impulse at the same time. This in turned forced the shuttle back into the normal fabric of space time at a sharp angle of inclination, resulting in the shuttle banking to the left at the same angle. The sudden movements of the shuttle did not give the pilot (that's me, folks) enough time to restabilize thrusters before the shuttlecraft made contact with an uncharted space object. 

Now for the translation. *Tom clears his throat gently* 

Shuttle: Shudder, shudder, stall. 
Me: What the he--
Shuttle: BANG! Boom. 
Me: DAMMIT! Smack. 
Console: CREAK. 
Engines: Whirrrrr, click, snap, twist.
Shuttle: shimmy, bang, bang, CRASH.
Me: Silence. 

More silence. So much silence I couldn't really tell you how long it was quiet. 

This was where I do believe I picked up a concussion, two broken ribs, a fractured clavicle, and an elbow that now bends in the <b>wrong direction.</b> 

Shortly after I decided to wake up, grab at a medkit, and wonder why it was so cold in here, I realized that the CRASH was an asteroid. 

And now for the best part of the log, before I forget and you all feel left out. This is the one where you find out what you get.

I will Harry any and all claims I may have had on the Delaney sisters. This includes threatening two ensigns from Engineering (and you know who you are) with medical castration if they asked aforementioned Delaney sisters on a double date. 

I leave B'Elanna all my books and every holosuite program I've ever owned or made. Especially Sandrine's, since she hates it so much. *grins in the darkness* You can do whatever you want with it.

Captain Janeway can have all my replicator rations and use them for coffee, since I need an excuse to post-humanously get on her good side and make her guilty at the same time. 

Everyone else can fight over whatever's left, because that'll make a good show for...everyone who isn't fighting over whatever's left.

So. Now that I'm on only four or five drugs and I'm sure I can think straight, I thought you'd all like to know that space is my biggest enemy. Space, space travel, space bars, space objects, shuttles that fly in space...notice the common denominator here?"

"event","Alright, so my day started pretty lousy. 

First off, I managed to piss off B'Elanna this morning. I did something stupid, I admit it, but she completely overreacted. Don't ask, folks, because not only is my wife really...

Well...

There's no nice way to put this. 

She's mean. 

Sure, she's a great, beautiful....Half-Klingon woman. I love my wife very, very much. But that doesn't change the fact that some mornings...she's really, really mean. 

This can be evidenced by the way she throws full pitchers of orange juice across the kitchen before Miral wakes up. Which makes Ben cry because he doesn't like loud noises. 

He should have picked different parents, poor little guy.

So, like I said, lousy start. I decided to get out of the line of fire and head to the garage because I was working on a new holonovel and it was an excuse to avoid more flying glassware. It was going great on both counts. I left last night with nearly all the actual programming done. I figured I'd put in a hard morning's work, tinker a little, and it'd be ready for my publisher in a little less than a week. 

Beautiful timing. 

I make it to the garage, start the program, get myself ready to finish a few personality subroutines...

My program isn't there. 

Not only is my program not there, but neither are my notes. My pre-programming. Subroutine alterations. Matrix functions. 

None of it. 

So three hours later when Miral comes to find me for lunch and maybe a game, she sees Daddy poking (alright, punching) the computer controls. 

There's absolutely no reason why that program should have disappeared, and I still don't know where it could have gone. No reason. I even backed the thing up and that wasn't there either. It was a total systems failure. 

In most normal situations I would have called B'El for help three seconds after I knew something wasn't right and couldn't fix it, but like I said, flying pitchers of orange juice are not normal circumstances, thanks. 

Miral went to go get Mommy, Mommy glared at Daddy, Daddy glared at the computer and willed it to work. No luck. B'El spent half the afternoon with that thing and she couldn't get any of it back. I helped try to reroute files, call up subroutines...nothing worked. 

We managed to make it back seventy thousand light years to earth, both of us vital in making that happen, and yet we got bowled over by the spare computer I keep in the garage. 

Irony stinks. 

We went back into the house around dinner time, and because 1) My wife was pissed at me and 2) she <i>had</i> helped me all day, I offered to make dinner. Er...grapple with the replicator and hope dinner was edible. B'Elanna offered to call up a colleague from the Academy and see if he could help with the problem, so she disappeared for another hour or so. 

We ate dinner with only minor problems...Miral spilled her milk and I nearly choked on a hamburger. Nothing out of the ordinary. Everyone was washed up, we watched a holovid, and Miral and Ben were sent to bed whilst I decided to try the waters. 

I sat with my wife on the couch. 

It was good. The day was still lousy, but it was getting better. She didn't push, shove, punch, or otherwise attempt to bruise me, so I figured my natural lovability and charm had some effect during dinner. 

We decided to watch another holovid because we're adults, alright, and we don't have bedtimes, and ended up...cuddling. Then it was bed time, so we kissed for awhile (and you can keep your smart comments to yourself, thank you very much) and went to sleep. 

Yes. I said we went to sleep. 

Anyway, the day started off really rotten, but B'El managed to fix it with a kiss. *shrugs a little and shoves his hands in his pockets* 

And, you know something crazy? I was watching her work on that computer system this afternoon and I couldn't talk for a moment because...she was so intense and focused. It reminded me of why I fell in love with her. It was so strange, because I had lost over a month of work and...it didn't matter. I'm married to a beautiful, passionate woman, we have two amazing kids and...suddenly nothing mattered but them."

"event","Power. 

I could define power for you, but that's really stupid because you could just as easily track down a Vulcan and get a much better picture of what the word means. Hell, ask a Vulcan with an artistic streak and you might get a nicely drawn picture of an equation relating to power. 

Power to me isn't being able to have all the money you want or save the universe. Do I like money? Yeah. Do I like the universe? Sometimes, sure. 

But that has nothing to do with it. 

There was a time when I would have said that power was being the pilot of a starship. To sit there and feel the engines coursing, throbbing almost imperceptibly through the decks. Subtle nuances, yeah, but there and powerful.

Power is seeing whatever is waiting for you out there, fate or death, glory or pain, and going out to meet them. Going out to meet them with your head held high, straight-backed and proud. Power is fear. Fearing what lies ahead and yet still having the courage to face it; fearing the strength in your own hands and yet trusting them to protect the ones you love. Power is believing in yourself when all those around you doubt you, and yet making allowances for their uncertainties and fears as well. Power is facing each morning with a new perspective. With new hope. 

Power is what people do every day. 

Sure, maybe it's that's a lot of gushy nonsense. But that's power to me."

"event","Saint Patrick's Day is the best holiday. Hands down. 

Forget about seeing people you know and love. That's just...that's superficial. 

You don't have to buy a gift for anyone, it's impossible to forget, and it comes with a built in way to show your Irish heritage by getting drunk on green beer and stuffing yourself with corned beef smothered in whiskey sauce.

Or was that whiskey smothered in corned beef? 

Anyway, it's a really great holiday and things were going really well for me until I...managed to break B'Elanna's favorite crystal bowl. It wasn't so bad when she was yelling, and it even wasn't terrible when she let out a howl or two. But it started to get really rotten when she tried to throw the shards at me and demanded I sleep at least a parsec and a half away from her tonight. 

Miral was nice enough to tell me I could spend the night with her rather than on the couch. Yeah. The floor looks really comfortable...

That floor had better be. Because when B'Elanna finds out I broke her favorite crystal bowl playing air football with Harry and a green frosted cupcake....

Maybe I should spend the next week or two in the shuttlecraft."

"event","It was a miracle. I've never been one for religion, but I can't fight evidence like that. 

A 1936 Ford landing in <i>Voyager</i>'s lap in the middle of the Delta quadrant?

Miracle. 

Sure, we got to meet people that had been abducted by aliens. Sure, Captain Janeway got to meet her childhood hero. Sure, we got to save them and release them back into society, even though that makes them sound like birds or wildebeests or something. Sure, they're happy and healthy and nice. Sure, we got to talk and it was nice. Friendly. <i>Nice</i>. They're great people, and that's wonderful.
 
But all this leaves me with just one question. 

Can I please, please, please, please, please, please, <i>please</i> have the Ford?"

"event","She's going to let me do it. I don't know how I managed to convince her, but Captain Janeway, the champion of all things proper and safe, is going to let me try to break the maximum warp barrier. 

Even though something could happen to me. Even though the Doctor has advised against it. Even though Chakotay is probably hemorrhaging over the thought.  

It's a little rotten of me, since I'll be doing it on my own. Harry and B'Elanna and even Neelix have done so much to make it work, and they can't come along for the ride. 

Is it even more rotten that I'm not all that upset about doing it alone?




<i>OOC Note: I've never really written for Tom Paris before. Due to this, I may seem extraordinarily out of character in some of my blogs. I hope you can understand that I'm trying to learn his many and varied idiosyncrasies, and that with luck, I'll improve drastically with reading and researching his personality. After all, the goal is to get inside is head, and I hope I'll be able to do that efficiently.</i>"

"event","so yeah...i'm FINALLY 21.  that rocks.  it also kinda sucks though...because i don't have the money to be 21.  i also finally started the bachelors program at fullsail.  yay for entertainment business!  it's interesting...or something.  the schedule is pretty wacky though...which is weird since it's supposed to be more normal than the recording arts program but whatever.  at least i'll never have to go to school in the middle of the night again.  that sucked!  
i should really start posting in here more.  i'm so boring though that i'm not sure if i want to put that many people to sleep!  hehe

ok...it's about 8:20 right now so i should probably get ready to go to class

"event","nobody is probably going to read this crap but if i don't talk to someone - machine or otherwise - right now i may very possibly explode.  or maybe implode...that would be cooler to see.  wait...i probably couldn't see myself imploding could i.  damn.  another sucky thing to happen today!  rock on sucking!!!

so yeah...tonight seriously kicked my ass.  first of all i sat on my couch for 3 hours playing some damn computer game.  how worthless am i??  then i get a call from my boyfriend's FRIEND telling me he forced my boyfriend to go to the bar with him.  bullshit he was forced.  a chance to go out and drink?  whyever would he refuse?? he couldn't even call me himself...but had to make his friend lie for him.  that made me feel really good about myself.  especially since it's the exact same thing my ex used to do to me so he could go out and drink and chase tail all night long.  so now i'm reliving all of that HORRIBLE relationship and i'm soooo pissed that i'm being forced to deal with it again with a whole new boyfriend that i didn't think would treat me like this.  
so there i was practically in tears because i'm seeing my relationship go horribly wrong just like my last one did (so maybe i'm over-reacting but if you knew what my ex put me through you would understand why i'm freaking out - yes it was THAT bad...)...so i decided to go take a shower to calm down or occupy my brain or something.  10 minutes later i emerge from the shower to find that the dogs have ripped open a trash bag and it's contents are strewn all over my apartment.  so i got to spend the next wonderful half hour cleaning up all that shit.  it was fucking awesome let me tell you!  
then the evening started to improve!  miraculous!  my friend jeff called me and asked if i wanted to go to a little get-together and drink some beers with him since he's leaving next week.  fucking alright! so now i'm just waiting for him to call me back so he can tell me how to get to wherever we're going.  
so hopefully that will happen soon and i can go have some fun and forget about all this bullshit for awhile.  

is it my damn birthday yet?"

"event","so i have 3 days of school left.  that is very neat.  i went and did my ""exit interview"" for financial aid.  that was pretty dumb.  since i'm coming back for the bachelor's in october my loans get deferred more...that means i have to go to the sallie mae  website and print off some form and take it in to financial aid and get it certified and send it in.  good times right?!?!?!  BUT...i have 6 months in which to accomplish this irritating task, so i'm not too concerned at this point.  
i am concerned that my parents will be here 1 week from today...i need to start cleanin this apartment!!!  ooo...i also need to figure out the fastest/easiest/cheapest (or something) route to st. augustine since they want to go there for some reason.  i have a feeling that will be a long week...st. augustine...disney...nagging...blah...

today we're learning about MIDI....oh joy.  we had a whole month on MIDI before this so i really don't think the teacher needs to go into everything quite so deeply.  it is zero fun.  but yeah...such is the nature of the class.  
and i have lab afterwards.  BURN!  
this weekend was fun though.  saturday rocked.  poor dug...he got some nasty things drawn on him again.  guess he shouldn't pass out before everyone else.  hehehehehe.
i need to clean my room.  maybe i'll do that tonight.  i should just go get some boxes and start packing stuff.  then maybe i'd be able to keep my floor visible.  probably not, but it was a nice idea.  i need to start looking at apartments and figure out where the hell we're moving to.  maybe kortni and i can go tour some places this week or next week.  that would be neat.  too bad all the really cool places are so damn far away from school.  now would be a good time to invent a teleporter.  someone should get on that pronto.  
i wonder how andrea's issues worked out last night.  maybe i should have stayed up.  i'm glad i went with my boyfriend on spring break so he had no way to cheat on me.  not that he would...but it sucks to think about it no matter what.  especially in her situation.  i would be pissed.  
so yeah...guess i better start paying attention or something.

"event","wow...i had a little too much to drink last night.  i'm definetly feelin it today.  blah....
we had fun though.  i even got to go to steak and shake.  that was a first.  i think i'll have to go back there sometime...it's freakin good.  so now i'm waiting for my headache to go away so i can get my laundry done and my room cleaned before i leave.  i need to pack too.  
so...evidently something happened last night but when i was told i was pretty trashed so i don't really remember the details anymore.  hopefully i can find out today.  that would be neat.  i hope everything works out...
i'm so ready for a vacation.  i'm still a little nervous but i'll get through it.  i miss daniel a lot.  and it's only been 2 days since i've seen him.  that must be a sign or something.  andrea- i think i'm having the same realizations as you are at this point!  it's weird huh!
ok...time to shower and attempt to get everything accomplished....

14 hours and 40 minutes until lift off...."

"event","i can't believe we're having a lecture on the last day before spring break.  having a midterm was bad enough...but the way this lecture is going it's probably going to run late -AGAIN- and i just want to go home and sleep.  that would be neat.  damn...he's been talking about ONE point on a slide for 25 minutes!  and he's still going!  if i were in hell this would be in.  this fucker lecturing me about something retarded for all eternity.  i better start prayin or something.  i don't want to have that happen forever.  ick.
oh good.  now he's telling us about programs to download.  that's fucking great.  shut up bitch!  let us go home!   
at least last night was fun.  kortni and ryan and i hung out.  they got drunk and i made flash cards for this stupid midterm.  that reminds me...i have to give him money today.  crap.  better write it on my hand.  wait it's there already!  sweet!  maybe the ATM will be working.  i would be excited.  i should probably get some money for the trip too.  don't like to travel with zero dollars.  is it sunday yet?  i would be very happy.  i'm ready to get far away from school for a few days.  this place is making  me crazy!  i love it...but it's making me crazy!
man...i really have to pee.  maybe we'll take a break soon.  i think we should just skip the break and leave early.  but out teacher the coffee fiend probably won't let that happen.  grrrrrrr.
alright...this dude needs to quit showing us plug-ins from the digidesign website and get on with the damn lecture!   we don't care!  we can look at this crap on our own time!  i hate you teacher!   aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!!!!!!!!  OH MY GOD I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL HIM
someone make it end!!!!!!!!!!
this is just getting ridiculous.  we've been sitting here for over an hour and we've been through 3 slides.  and i'm sure there are a LOT more.  no way we're getting out on time.  well shit i should be used to that.  if we take a break i'm leaving.  i have 2 hours left to miss.  i may just have to use them.  i can't take this dousch anymore.  if i stay i might get violent.  seriously.  now he's bitching about people talking.  maybe he should take the hint that he needs to shut the fuck up and let us go.  but nooooo.  he just gives us a speech on how we need to respect ""his"" time in lecture.  fuck that.
i haven't been this pissed in awhile.  good thing i can type a post so i don't freak out and kill people or something.  that would probably not be too good.  i don't really want to go to jail.  that would suck.
GRRRR!!"

so yeah i'm bored and i'm typing.  maybe i'll even remember to post it when i get home.  that would be neat.  alright!  now i'm deaf because my teacher finds it necessary to crank  up the speakers while he's doing a crappy drum edit!  this is just peachy!
is it 5pm yet?  DAMN!  it's only 9:50.  i have 7 more hours.  grrrrrrrrrr
ok that's enough

and i'm awake.  damn.  that was a nice break.  lunchables rule!  now it's 11:10 and there's only an hour and 35 minutes left!   yay!!!   maybe people will stop asking retarded questions so we can get out of here on time.  i don't really want to haul ass to lab again.  that sucks.  i think that fullsail should build an underground tunnel between fs2 and fs3.   and they could make it like the chicago airport and have moving walkways and funky neon lights and stuff.  that would be neat.

it's 8:56!  almost time to start!  woohoo.  i'm so excited.  anyone sense a little sarcasm in here?  i think i might.  
at least we get cool desks.  they even have wheels!  high tech!  nice to see what our tuition dollars are going to.

"event","so i spent the last 2 hours looking at my old yearbooks and my scrapbook from high school.  needless to say i'm pretty depressed now.  it's strange to see pictures of you and  your ""old friends"" having the times of your lives and realize that you'll probably never even see most of them again.  andrea gave me a picture of me and micheal tonight too...and that made me think of everything we went through together and how much i miss him.  i wish people didn't have to die.  at least not when they're 18 years old.  and when they have issues with others that they have yet to work out.  even though we spent a lot of time pretending to hate each other...i really did love him.  and he really loved me.  so much, in fact, that his last girlfriend hated me for it.  sometimes i wonder what might have been.  but so does everyone at one time or another.  what really hurts is that fact that i couldn't even go to his funeral.  that's something i'll regret forever i'm sure.  
then i started thinking about all the people that i was so close to for what is really such a short time.  it's so weird how you can love people soo much and then never talk to them again once high school ends and you start a new life, and they all forget about you.  and even if you do see them again, you know it can never, ever be the same.  
wow...i sound like a bitter pathetic asshole don't i?  well i don't give a shit at this point.  i need to get it out or something.
you know what's amazing?  it's amazing how much i've changed since high school.  even since i was 18.  it's like i'm a totally different person.  i'm not sure if that's better or worse...probably better.  i hope so anyway.

i guess my conclusion is that i'm very happy with my life now, and the people i'm surrounded by.  i'll always remember the good times, and the bad ones, but i shouldn't be too sad that they're over because i'll always have the memories, no matter what.  like our class motto said: ""don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.""
that makes a lot of sense."

so yeah.  doing dishes sucks.  someone should invent something that will do it for you.  like a dishwasher...only better.  that would be sweet.  it feels weird to type when your hands are all pruny.   it's kinda fun...
rmc is almost over.  that rules.  i'm a little nervous for the lab test outs though.  since i have the ssl right after the amek i think i'll probably get confused like i did in lab today and forget the odd/even pan or something dumb like that.  oh well...even if i do i'll probably still pass.  hope so anyhow.
i'm sleepy...again.  it's annoying.  it's like this month just made me constantly tired.  on friday i fell asleep at 7pm and didn't wake up untill almost 8 saturday morning.  it felt good to sleep that long though.  
played some drunken basketball on saturday night.  that was entertaining.  maybe i'll do it again soon.  got some great ""action shots"" with my phone.  i love it when people are so entertained by a camera that happens to be in a cell phone.  they're funny.
dug and i made some progress on the ep tonight.  i came up with a cool piano part.  it was pretty fun.  now i just need to sit down and work on the rest of the songs.  hopefully i can come up with something cool for them too.  
hmmm...think i'll watch some more mystery science theater 3000 (thanks baby!  i love it!)"

It was a pleasure merely to<br>hear the sound of her voice, with which, like<br>an instrument of many strings, she could pass<br>from one language to another . . .'

"event","yep...that's pretty much how i feel right now.  i cleaned the kitchen.  only took a couple hours.  and now i smell like bleach.  so that's pretty sexy.  i actually cleaned out the dishwasher....something i've never done.  but when there's a bunch of food in it you don't really have any other options.  because washing your dishes in food doesn't exactly work.  i'm giving in 2 days before it's a disgrace again.  i was going to clean the litter box but i was pretty spent after the kitchen.  and it's not my cat after all.  but whatever.  
went to see ""eurotrip"" tonight with diane and ritchie.  it was surprisingly a pretty good movie.  funny as shit.  there was a little too much old wrinkled man penis in it though...if you see it you'll know what i mean.  we snuck in pop and candy from kmart instead of spending $800 on it in the theatre.  what badasses we are!! right...brought back memories from like 6th grade in geneva.  we used to do that shit then and think we were cool or something.  that seems like a really long time ago.  i guess it was.  i am 20 after all.  
you know what sucks?  feeling like a visitor (a very unwanted one at that) in your home.  that's getting a little old.  i seriously think i'm going to live by myself in august.  just so the only person i'll have to clean up after/pay bills for/buy food for/generally worry about is me.  i guess i'm just not the kind of person that does well living with people.  i'm too introverted or something.  but you have to do it to find that out i guess.  
i miss the old days.  when andrea and i were best friends.  we had  a lot of fun.  now we're both so different and it's weird.  i love her to death but i feel like i don't even know her anymore.  and most of the time i think she hates me.  maybe she does.  people grow apart i guess.  evidently she ""took care of my car"".  i'm not sure what that means.  nice of her to tell me.  pretty sure i was capable of that.  would have been nice if i could have gotten my shit out of it too.  apparently i didn't need it.  
soooo...since i'm obviously not wanted i've been looking into moving out.  unfortunatly i'm not sure how that would work.  i don't want to break my lease and i doubt anyone would sub-lease it.  i don't want to screw andrea and tony by making them pay rent etc.  i don't know what to do i guess.  so i'll write about it.  
is it spring break yet?  it will be nice to get away for awhile.  even if it is going to be scary to go to ohio.  at least i won't be here.  

ok...so that was a long and rather whiny post but i needed to get it out of my system so there it is."

"event","once upon a time in mexico is a weird movie.  wow...
so yeah...i'm bored.  i need to clean my room.  not in the mood.   i need to do a lot of things for that matter.  and i'm not in the mood for any of it.  i think i'll just go to sleep.  yeah.  that sounds like fun.  man...today was my 3 month anniversary and i didn't do shit.  that sucks.  but that's ok.  i understand.  it's not a big deal anyway.  seems like a lot longer than 3 months.  that's crazy.  maybe that's a sign or something.  who knows? 
ok...guess it's time to go to sleep.  
goodnight."

"event","i took out a bunch of trash today and one of the bags leaked all over the back of my car.  it looks pretty neat i tell ya.  oh well..at least the trash is out.  i can wash my car later...if it ever stops being all rainy and gross for a long enough period of time.
i need to study...but i'm not in the mood yet.  i feel weird being ""home"".  i don't really feel like i live here right now...i don't think anyone wants me to live here anyhow.  i guess they only have to deal with me for a few more months.  it is kinda weird to feel like an outsider in your own apartment..but it doesn't really bother me that much.  nothing's been bothering me lately...i'm not sure what's going on.  it's like everything i thought i was is changing.  i'm becoming a whole new person or something.  it's very confusing.
i'm not making too much sense right now...so i think i'll stop writing and call daniel.  

only thing to do is jump over the moon"

"event","i can't believe this is our last week of audiotronics and esa.  that's pretty neat.  that means esa final tomorrow.  blah.  that'll be ""fun"".  
i need a vacation.  i want to go somewhere cool.  maybe when i graduate i can.  i doubt it.  unless someone wants to give me a free ticket i'm pretty much stuck here i think.  oh well.  i'll live.
i'm having issues with my musical taste right now.  it's like everything i used to listen to i can't really get into anymore...but i don't know what to get into instead.  i need to find something new or something...this is really starting to piss me off.
any suggestions?"

"event","i'm soooo damn sick.   i feel like i'm dying.  no fun.  and i have a dilemna...i'm supposed to pick up my check today after 4:30...and i have lab at 5:15.  so i'll probably be late.  oh well.  i guess i can deal with being late.  i want my damn check!   that's what i say!  maybe we'll get out of class early.  that would be neat.  neat indeed.
i have to go see my MIDI teacher today too...get some make-up work.  woo hoo!  and i have to take chris with me.  hooray.  i wonder how daniel's 5am lab went...hope he's still awake for class.  i'm glad i don't have any of those this month.   i haven't had any of those for awhile...so it's probably about time.  i bet i'll get hosed next month.  i wish i could find my green pills.  i have a headache and i would like to get rid of it.  hopefully all the pills my mom sent me will get here soon too.  that would rock.  
being sick can lick my ass"

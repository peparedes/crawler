"event","This is really just for the one or two people who are wondering where the hell i've been.

For the past couple months my hours at the Rec Center have been bumped up to 30 per week- And still, I can not afford my bills.  Part of these 30 hours included three days where I would wake up at 5 and work at 6am.  Last week I said, ""Fuck that,"" and cancelled those hours for a afternoon saturday shift.  Anyone who has a serious delusional problem and believes they *need* to see me can find me there.  

Besides working a lot, this past month has been incredibly busy with school work.  There were a couple of exams recently and every class has long papers with stringent formatting guidelines due this week and next week.  One paper, if I may spout as an intellectual bourgeois for a moment, dealt with Alpha -Lipoic Acid benefits in diabetic populations.  The other one dealt with golf cart ejections (as in jackass).  So lots of hours went into that shit too.  

Only a couple more of these papers to go and exam week is left, but grades are looking up.  

Short form: Finances: bad, School: good.  

Reuben better contribute to the rent or he will have his face stomped in during his sleep.  As for not owing me anything, I would think contributing $430+ per month to house his lazy (often non-contributing) ass counts as something to appreciate.  

He and I did a good job cleaning the apartment the other day, and it's fun hanging around and man-crushing on Peter Gabriel.  But eventually, supporting people for so long and getting close to nothing- small random contributions to rent when convenient- in return really gets tiring: Especially when you become financially drained yourself.  And if work isn't providing enough, ask the parents!  Christ, whiny soapbox journal entry or not, the shit pisses me off.

I tried to sell my old childhood baseball cards today to a grimy old fat man on 56th street- to help pay for rent(!!!)  I'm getting rid of lifelong posessions to try and make a few extra bucks and contribute the usual amount while others glide by for free.  Fucking gay.  So for a 65 Mickey Mantle, 61 Roger Maris, and other quality old cards I was offered $50!  Robbery.  The bulbous, poofy white haired old kyke than made stupid small talk with me for a half hour.  ""Oy.""

Now it is time to eat, go home, and hopefully if people aren't sleeping in the living room, I can actually travel around the apartment *I* pay for with lights on and interact with objects in said living room and kitchen w/o fear of being rude and noisy!  What a fucking bullshit scenario.  

Passive generosity is NEVER REWARDED and if extended for too long will only be taken advantage of and abused.  Be nice to others, but look after your own ass too.

Peace"

"event","When you have reliably douchebag roommates to wake you up?

So my best way of dealing with my co-habitants is to simply be away from them as often as possible.  I have no desire to be around them, and I have better, more trustworthy, and generous people in my life when I'm on campus.  

I'm content now as a tenant of Apartment 4L rather than being a friendly roommate.  Just tell me how much rent is due at the top of the month and don't purposefully wake me up at 3 in the fucking morning!  That's all I ask.  I don't care if you are diagnosed with HIV or your father dies, there's absolutely no justifying fucking up my entire day by waking me up in the middle of the night.

Today some people queried, ""But Doug, I thought you were thrilled to be moving in with your best friends?""  And to that I explained that I absolutely was.  I didn't care that I'd have no bed or other furniture, no cable, no microwave, and at the time a much more inconvenient bus schedule-  I was satisfied knowing that I'd be spending my time with two people I truly enjoyed being around.     

I now regret being such a fool in having my hopes so high and so freely extending my trust.  To expect even an iota of reciprocity of friendship from these two was clearly a mistake.  I have learned from this and am moving on with plans to eventually phase those people who make me feel this way out of my life completely.  They certainly couldn't give two fucks about me planning this, but to me it is a healthy way of taking out the garbage and finding more worthy friends.

I'm happy I wrote this.  Peace."

"event","I intentionally threw darts this morning around 7am over the immobile sloth carcass of my roommate.  The resulting thunk of the darts hitting the board or dry-wall was the same sound I was treated to and awoken by last night around 3am... That, along with the usual horsing around noises.  I had a few minutes to spare before I left for school, and so instead of being concerned with interrupting anyone's sleep patterns (I mean really why would I be? They aren't MINE!), I thought I would reciprocate their kind gesture.  

Hopefully my new avoidance tactics can lead to being more productive in school, work, and all of that super exciting stuff... Maybe I can even :o interact :o with people who elicit some sort of genuine emotion and consideration.

I ran into one friend today on campus who said they baked cookies for someone because they like seeing other people ""happy.""  That may sound smarmy or trite, but it struck a chord with me and left me almost shell-shocked.  I'll quit whining now."

Since the last post some awesome things have transpired:

Some of my financial aid came in, I was able to see most of my family for the first time in 10 months last week, I got a car(!), and best of all I was able to meet a really awesome (and hot) girl! :o

Now only if Adam would stop eating all of my god damn food!  A wretched leech, he also invested in an automobile this past week... A geriatric snowbird vehicle with the saving grace of OSCILLATING AIR VENTS!!!  Good Gawd.

I'm hungry.

Ahhh yes, the dartboard!  One of our walls now resembles the aftermath of a Capone Mafia drive-by shooting.  The dartboard, in comparison, appears unscathed.  Hundreds of dollars in property damage aside, we all have benefited in learning that I am the King of Blindfolded Darts.  

Primarily, this rare entry is motivated by my current state of limbo.  I'm waiting to hear back from my favoritest lady sheina online as I don't have a cell phone :(  My irrational fear of dismemberment via shotgun blast is restraining me from calling her family's landline again.  Regardless of how today turns out, I am thrilled with how the past month has turned out in meeting and sharing my time with such a wonderful person.  Being with her is a first for me and it's really exciting.  As much as I hear she may worry, I do so as well as I'm completely new and oblivious to how all of this works!  'Tis a shame that Canada is requesting their prize back, but I can't say I blame those who are arranging it out of their care for her.

I can't think of anything else now except how badly I have to pee, so I'm off to create some Eau de Toilette"

All you have to do is:

1.  Attend your local county fair.

2.  Pay the old, toothless man two bits, and lay down for about half an hour to 3 days (depending on how his ""handiwork"" is that particular day).  

3.  Once Gramps is done fenagling your genitalia and/or you are permanently scarred for life, submit your proud replica to the patent office so that no other person may lay claim to your penis.    

4.  Finally: ADVERTISE!  Take pictures of your replica dong and purchase some quality space on a town billboard or at the Elks Club.

Since the last entry I've been busy as shite and thus my time for witty commentary has dwindled considerably.  I have no entertaining Dionysian tales of debauchery or self-applauding accounts of me bitching out fat old guys in college, but I have this much:

I am the God of Tiger Woods 2005 (Xbox).  No one can defeat BURLY MAN!  He has 110% in all of his ratings, and even if he were a scrub, he'd fucking pwn you anyways because he's BURLY!

Humbug.

My room still doesn't have a bed or a lamp.  Give me yours.

I was informed the other day that my bed frame at the old apartment was broken...  HUZZAH!

I have a farmer tan.  My face, forearms, and shins are tan, while the rest of me is a milky albino:  The chicks won't know if they're scoring with Hulk Hogan or Powder.  I choose Powder because it would give me the power of Levitation and who knows what kind of kinky sex can come from that???

<P>This jurassic, gluttonous, drunken buffon of a hybrid human being is the porcine taint-eater that threatened to kick my ass Wednesday morning...</P>
<P>For it was a fine Wednesday morning, July 13, 2005.&nbsp; Professor Weinzuirl was entertaining his students with an action-packed in your face presentation of chemical bond resonance structures when a rowdy group of fuckfaces began to cause quite a stir outside the classroom walls.&nbsp; Both doors had been ajar as to allow cool air to circulate throughout the classroom.&nbsp; Sighing with disapproval, yours truly tried his hardest to hear the lecture over the ruckus.&nbsp; But, alas... 'Twas not possible.</P>
<P>And so I strolled... Make that stomped out of the class room and elucidated my dilemna to the surprisingly well-aged group of hooligans.&nbsp; It went a lil sumthin like this, ""Hey guys, I can't hear my Professor over you out here, would you mind lowering your voices for a bit or moving down the hall?""&nbsp; </P>
<P>""No way dude: We're studyin, you can just close the doors if you want quiet.""</P>
<P>Shocked, chagrinned, and appalled with their lack of courtesy and manners, I retorted, ""I should not have to get up in the middle of class to close the doors because the people outside are impolite and rude.""</P>
<P>As soon as I found my seat, the aforementioned fuckfaces went on with their jolly, vociferous commentary and laughter.&nbsp; 15 minutes later the class concluded and I was completely lost with the material.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Enraged with the anger of 1,000 Dragon Ball Z characters trying to squeeze out a shit, I proclaimed, ""You guys are a bunch of douchebags, have some fuckin manners.""&nbsp; </P>
<P>At this point a corpulent, bulbous geezer usurped the leadership position of his mini-cult.&nbsp; My initial polite request for common courtesy, manners, and Momma's Golden Rule (Treat Others...) had degraded into mindless vulgarities.</P>
<P>These vulgarities included:<BR></P>
<P>Fuck</P>
<P>Asshole</P>
<P>Douchebag</P>
<P>&nbsp;and Dick.</P>
<P>But, I digress.</P>
<P>About 30 minutes after my class concluded, I decided to visit the nearby Subway.&nbsp; Conveniently, the very classroom I had attended prior was now filled with the same analprobers who crossed me earlier.&nbsp; From here my plan came to fruition.</P>
<P>""My, oh, my!"" I exclaimed... ""Why the doors in these halls are open!&nbsp; This gives me every right to be a rude, impolite prick!&nbsp; I think I'm going to just stand out here for a while and purposefully be annoying!""</P>
<P>Making sure to be loud and prove my point, I continued with a mockery of Ringleader Bob, ""I'm 40 years old, I'm fat, and I'm still in college... Why do I bother living?""&nbsp;</P>
<P>My mission accomplished, I left for Subway and celebrated over a 6-inch Double&nbsp;Meat Oven Roasted Chicken Breast on Wheat... with&nbsp;Green Peppers,&nbsp;Pickles, and Honey Mustard.&nbsp; This piece of information was absolutely vital to the re-telling of this story, fyi...</P>
<P>On my way back to the Rec Center, I stumbled upon the hallway once more and gloriously whistled the Andy&nbsp;Griffith Theme Song.&nbsp; Somehow my previous tirade did not stir Boris Yeltsin, but my stunning rendition of&nbsp;Ode le Mayberry provoked&nbsp;Husky Hank to leave his desk,&nbsp;leave the *building* and run out towards me as I was leaving to the Rec Center.&nbsp; </P>
<P>""Now you're just being a dick!!!"" the observant oaf bellowed.</P>
<P>""Keep flexing your muscles! (??????) Yeah keep walkin,&nbsp;I'm a kick yer ass!""</P>
<P>...</P>
<P>I was almost speechless.&nbsp; I wanted to laugh at his agony and morbid state of obesity and certain impending death...&nbsp;(especially if he wanted a fight.)&nbsp; Further, I felt complimented by his muscles remark.&nbsp; Sadly, I feel for Aunt Bea, Opie,&nbsp;Barney,&nbsp;Andy, and their ilk... I don't believe they ever intended for their theme song to evoke such strong violent rage (except in Nazi propaganda).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Not breaking my stride, I turned back and told him&nbsp;""You deserved it."" </P>
<P>Commentary:</P>
<P>I knew full well I was being a complete ass.&nbsp; It was in retaliation to his being so earlier in the day.&nbsp; I proved my point that I should not have to get up and close the door and made him look like a fool in front of his entire class.&nbsp; I only wish that it didn't have to come at the expense of his professor's lecture and his peers' attention to the material.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This middle age ""man"" should be a role model for those half his age with whom he shares the classroom with.&nbsp; But sadly, his&nbsp;behavior degenerated to that of a child even younger than his peers.&nbsp; He should be ashamed not only for his lack of manners and understanding with&nbsp;my original request,&nbsp;but appalled by his&nbsp;antics later in the day.&nbsp; I look back and laugh at the whole&nbsp;altercation- Particularly his insistence on&nbsp;""kicking (my) ass.""&nbsp; Unfortunately, he could not take&nbsp;what he figuratively dished out earlier in the day and greatly disappointed me.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If you ever look around you and feel&nbsp;disgusted with the lack of intelligence, respect, dignity, and manners people of&nbsp;our generation have- Don't forget that this is not an epidemic entirely exclusive to our demographic.&nbsp; Sometimes these pretentious, self-righteous baby boomers need a reality check.&nbsp; Don't be afraid to give them one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

"event","<P>So I'm really thinkin about doing another show around October 1st... One that's semi ""tested.""&nbsp; It's lightweight class is much more reasonably attainable, so I may still be able to keep my wits and senses as I take my load of classes and cut for the show.&nbsp; Here's a few more pics I doug up from last Saturday... Took em in between pre judging and the evening show :)</P>

And so I awoke about 7:00am to eat, if I remember correctly, some more sweet potato with a tiny bit of chicken breast.&nbsp; Our buddy Rob had proven to be a HUGE resource the day before in preparing our diet and the day of the show in monitoring it.&nbsp; He was also there to make sure our Dream Tan was applied absolutely perfect.&nbsp; I can't possibly overstate how valuable his experience was in assisting us with our diet in the final days and making sure all of the little details were covered.&nbsp; </P>
<P>We arrived at the Chamberlain High Auditorium around 8:30am for the ""Pre-Judging Meeting.""&nbsp; At this meeting, the promoter, John Schleicher, explained the history of the Tampa Bay Classic, introduced the Guest Posers, and had his cronies elaborate upon the rules of the pre-judging and its organization.&nbsp; One of Schleicher's most notable lines, ""If any of you get upset with the judging, Look in the mirror.""&nbsp; For some reason that motivated me.&nbsp; </P>
<P>With the meeting over with, the show was to begin at 10:00am with the Over 60 Men's group.&nbsp; Fortunately the Open Men posed last, so we had plenty of time to apply our Dream Tan lotion in the restroom.&nbsp; Rob did an awesome job with making sure my tan was perfect.&nbsp; I just hope he didn't get any jollies from it!&nbsp; Many other competitors complimented my selection of tanning products (Pro-Tan and Dream Tan #2), and I easily had one of the best tans on stage.&nbsp; Now, it is very important to be practically as dark as possible, because if you are not, the bright stage lights will 'wash you out' and your cuts and musculature will not be as impressive.&nbsp; The tanning lotion which is applied to accomplish this feat is very delicate and will streak or splotch if it is touched.&nbsp;With this in mind, I had to stand with my legs and arms in an ""open stance"" as to avoid touching anyone else or any objects in my vicinity.&nbsp; This was quite obnoxious, but it is worth mentioning.&nbsp; Half of the day's work is making sure you don't get lotion on a non-competitor or fuck up your tan.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Seemingly 2/3 of the total competitors were in Women's Figure.&nbsp; The day <EM>dragged forever</EM> until finally they called the bantamweights back to pump-up backstage.&nbsp; My friend Andy and I waited for our turn to go pump up, but it didn't come for a long while... Eventually it was heard, ""ALL OPEN MEN report to the backstage area.""&nbsp; <STRONG>This</STRONG> was absurd.</P>
<P>The Pump-Up Room was <EM>at most</EM> 12x12 feet.&nbsp; It was already cluttered with NO people in it... Crappy old dumbbells, ez curl bars, and a raggedy old bench press littered the floor.&nbsp; Two or three faded mirrors leant against the walls, and the floor was slippery as hell from all the tanning oil.&nbsp; Even for one person, this place was a complete dump.&nbsp; Yet somehow, the Tampa Bay Classic braintrust felt it proper to round up about 20 guys and throw them all in there at the same time to pump up!!!&nbsp; Keep in mind everyone is trying not to touch each other or fuck up their tans.&nbsp; It was the most chaotic scene:&nbsp; The eventual overall winner, a 240 pound roid fiend, would even lose control of the barbell bench press and almost break another competitor's foot as the plates fell off each end of the bar!&nbsp; He was a completely inconsiderate asshole and didn't even apologize or say a word.&nbsp; Back to the hectic backdrop:</P>
<P>&nbsp;The lightweights had maybe 10 or 15 minutes to pump up.&nbsp; After <EM>one set</EM> of barbell curls (45 pounds), I got a huge pump.&nbsp; I had been so depleted for so long, that the huge carb up heading into the show and backstage area had my body bursting at the seems waiting to get a pump.&nbsp; It felt incredible.&nbsp; A few more sets of dumbbell curls, side laterals, and hard chest flexing and I was ready to go.&nbsp; It was time for the Lightweight Division Prejudging:</P>

<P>I was a bit nervous up on stage, but I was confident that I would do well.&nbsp; At times I could not hear the judges' instructions over people yelling, presumably in my favor, as I had a ton of supporters come to both the morning and the night shows. (Thanks!)&nbsp; Rob was in the crowd cheering me on and boosting my confidence yelling, ""What is this a Pro Show???"" or ""That's a Level 5 Physique!"" I almost wanted to laugh up on stage, but at least it kept me relaxed.&nbsp; I honestly hadn't practiced holding my poses enough, so the one thing I was worried about as we walked off was that I had shaken too much during each pose.&nbsp; Only one person from the crowd confirmed my fear, so I was reassured afterwards that I did alright.&nbsp; I was also reassured by the 3rd competitor who told me before even going on stage, ""You have it won.""&nbsp; And perhaps I may have... Simply on a height comparison, I have more mass at my frame than the other two competitors in my class.&nbsp; At that point, it's only a matter of conditioning and symmetry.&nbsp; Fortunately, I did not come in ""flat"" or ""soft.""&nbsp; In fact, I feel like I came in just right.</P>
<P>So as our pre-judging and Ben's pre-judging was complete, we all headed home for a short while to relax.&nbsp; The evening show meeting was to start at 5:30pm so we had some time to spare.&nbsp; At this time Ben prepared his Evening Show routine(!)&nbsp; Mine was pretty much ready to go.&nbsp; I was bored and didn't feel like sitting around the house so I went&nbsp;to the Rec Center with Rob while he did his Legs&nbsp;workout.&nbsp; Needless to say, I&nbsp;looked like an alien freak with all of my tan lotion on inside the gym.&nbsp; I hit a few poses and showboated around a little bit much to the workers' delight.&nbsp;I was having a blast.&nbsp; I had seen pictures of the pre-judging and was just beaming with confidence.&nbsp; Never had I looked so good in my entire life.&nbsp; Hell, i even practiced some posing out in the middle of the gym by the squat rack mirrors with Rob!&nbsp; Took my shirt off right&nbsp;there in front of everyone and went&nbsp;to town.&nbsp; It was my day and nothing would get in my way.</P>
<P>The evening meeting started late, and another light coat of Dream Tan was applied to cover up any rough spots.&nbsp; Hours passed as 1,000 different classes of Figure posed and basically all of the competitors got trophies.&nbsp; Schleicher's commentary during the whole fiasco was mind-numbingly wretched, redudnant, and detestable.&nbsp; Every third competitor had ""radiant skin,"" every 2nd competitor had ""a glowing smile,"" and ALL of the figure competitors were the ""epitome of what all women should strive for in their fitness endeavours.""&nbsp; The same 3 or 4 cliche lines were repeated ad nauseum and the entire crowd was audibly gagging&nbsp;attempting to asphyxiate themselves.&nbsp; </P>
<P><IMG src=""http://www.pukeplanet.com/pukeimages/thumb-toilet_puke.jpg""></P>
<P>Still grazing on apricots, powerade, and the like, the Men's Open Class was finally being called upon to pump up in the back.&nbsp; Fortunately for Andy and myself, the lightweight division was called back seperately from the rest of the pack.&nbsp; I forgot to mention that there were camera men in the pump up room as well, who served no purpose other than to get in the way, alter your pump up routine, and ultimately make more money off of video sales.&nbsp; I pretty much did the same pump up exercises that I did earlier in the day: Some shoulder isolation movements, bicep curls, rows, and the like and went out and did my thing.&nbsp; Most competitors posed to either heavy rock, hip-hop, or some sort of club anthem (Usher, etc.)&nbsp; And while it may not have been a crowd-pumping jam, I posed to a slower song: <EM>Kiss From a Rose</EM> - Seal.&nbsp; At the very least I had hoped it would stand out.&nbsp; As a shorter, lighter competitor, I didn't believe that I should go out there and stomp like a wild man to death metal.&nbsp; Each musical posing routine was only a minute long, and while my routine had been overanalyzed to death several times a day leading up to it- The routine itself flew by!&nbsp; The wild cheers of my friends who attended really put a cap on the performance.&nbsp; After each of the class's competitors did their routine, the placings were announced.&nbsp; My friend Andy got 2nd, and I got first!&nbsp; The trophies were absolutely huge!&nbsp; </P>

<P>We had our pictures taken with our trophies for Southern Muscle Magazine, and I had to go back to the Pump Up Room to prepare for the Overall Posedown later in the night.&nbsp; I was exhaused and didn't feel like posing anymore.&nbsp; I was ready to eat!&nbsp; Each class went through their routines, some came back with trophies, and others did not.&nbsp; Ben's third place trophy had an awesome pose adorning the top, but unfortunately he couldnt be out there with me for the overall posedown.&nbsp; Once the posedown started, it was time to have fun!&nbsp; Side by side I was compared to the bantamweight, middleweight, light heavy, and heavyweight winners.&nbsp; We did our mandatory poses and then battled it out at the front of the stage for top honors.&nbsp; 'Boes were thrown, people were almost pushed over (by the douchebag heavyweight), and smiles were shot from ear to ear as the guys were up there having a blast trying to out-macho one another.&nbsp; The whole crowd was just eating it up with all my friends cheering me on as well.&nbsp; I tried my best, but in the end the judges had to hand the #1 Overall to the Heavyweight winner.&nbsp; He wasn't the leanest and by all accounts his posing was terrible, but his sheer mass won it.&nbsp; The best analogy from my perspective was that Ronnie Coleman won over Lee Priest or Dexter Jackson.&nbsp; Certainly he's no Ronnie, and I'm no Priest or Dexter, but it's the best comparison I can make.</P>

<P>I was thrilled.&nbsp; Finally it was all over!&nbsp; The entire day I was just in awe that this was actually taking place.&nbsp; I *competed* in a bodybuilding show!&nbsp; I won my class!&nbsp; I went through the entire dieting process, got shredded to 3% body fat, and almost came out the Overall Winner!&nbsp; The other overall posedown competitors suggested that I may have been the one to have finished 2nd to the giant roid monster.&nbsp; The whole day was just an incredible rush of adrenaline, excitement, and happiness.&nbsp; Months of dedication, focus, hard work, and any other cliche abstract ideas you can think of all culminated in one day of incredible fun.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Before heading out, Ben, Rob, and I took a few pictures together on stage.&nbsp; I don't know if Ben and I got any together by ourselves because an obnoxious drunk or dumb blonde kept bugging us:</P>

<P>Afterwards, I got to talk and eat&nbsp;with my best friends who came to support Ben, Andy, and myself:&nbsp; Adam, Libra, her b/f Adam,&nbsp;Denny, Kyle, Donnie, Jimmy, Rob, Reesha, Julia, &nbsp;Dwayne, Mike,&nbsp;Leah, Cameron, and many others I'm sadly forgetting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many came during the day but couldn't make the night show.&nbsp; I thank Vee, Doc,&nbsp;Abby, Grant, Jen, and Leslie from the Rec Center for coming to&nbsp;the A.M. show!&nbsp; </P>
<P>Today&nbsp;I&nbsp;weigh <EM>twenty </EM>pounds heavier than I did at the weigh-ins Friday night!&nbsp;&nbsp;First I gorged myself on nachos, soda,&nbsp;and a bbq bacon cheeseburger at&nbsp;Gators'&nbsp;restaurant where we all celebrated our awesome day.&nbsp; I then&nbsp;slept <STRONG>fourteen </STRONG>hours&nbsp;up to 4pm when I&nbsp;continued my binge eating pizza and cookies all day!&nbsp; My Monday feast included tons of glorious mall chicken and cookies!&nbsp; Tuesday has been much of the same.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I am&nbsp;positively certain I have left&nbsp;something out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a doubt.&nbsp; There is no way I could have captured every thing that made the past weekend so special and unique.&nbsp; Once again I have&nbsp;to thank those people who helped make it special:&nbsp; All those who attended the show and&nbsp;Ben and Andy for being a part of it with me.&nbsp; I couldn't think of anyone I'd rather have prepared with!&nbsp; I hope if I ever decide to do another show, be it this fall (pretty unlikely) or next year ( a lil more likely) that one of you guys, hopefully both of you, are around to do it all again!</P>

"event","<P>This past weekend was such an amazing experience and my attempt to write a diary of the events will never be able to do it justice.&nbsp; I'm trying to write about it now with most of it fresh in my mind so I can look back and never forget how crazy this whole thing has been.&nbsp; I will try my best, for my own sake, to cover everything I possibly can: Even if it means boring other readers with mind-numbing details.&nbsp; This is definitely meant for personal reflection, so I apologize and warn anyone else reading this ahead of time of its nature.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I started the year around 195, down about 10 pounds from the top of my ""bulking"" phase.&nbsp; <IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v376/uprechelon/DougFOLDguns.jpg""></P>
<P>I clearly had some size on my arms, but there certainly was no six-pack to be seen underneath my raggedy, battle-tested, trademark tank-top.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The Spring semester plodded along as an emphasis was placed on heavy deadlifts and pursuing certain folk of the female persuasion.&nbsp; My weight for the early Spring hung around 185-190.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I began to go out once or twice a week for late nights on the town which led to a little bit more weight loss and more drinking.&nbsp; When I hung out with my friend Adam, it was great... When I hung out with someone else it fucked with my mind.&nbsp; My weight dropped to 180.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The ""Strongest Bull"" contest took place March 5th, and I made myself puke in the restroom to make weight.&nbsp; This would be my first pleasant ""making weight"" experience... I made it to 175 and finished 3rd in my weight division.&nbsp; The highlight of this was deadlifting 500 pounds.</P>
<P><IMG style=""WIDTH: 285px; HEIGHT: 227px"" height=771 src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/dougmoore/dougdeadlift.jpg"" width=820></P>
<P>I was happy that I participated even though I basically ""beat myself"" by trying a weight on bench press that I wasn't able to handle instead of going for a ""safe bet.""&nbsp; With this not being the focus of the journal, I'll sum it up with saying my weight came back up to my usual 185 pounds within a few weeks.</P>
<P>A few weeks after&nbsp;the contest, Ben and Andy had been talking about getting ready for a bodybuilding show in St. Augustine some time in the Summer.&nbsp; With my depression and wild dietary habits egging me on to try something extreme, I suggested preparing for the NPC Tampa Bay Classic Bodybuilding competition June 11th.&nbsp; We all agreed to give it a shot.&nbsp; I started my diet 13 weeks out,&nbsp;and&nbsp; we took some pictures March 28th- 11 weeks away from the show.</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/dougmoore/DougFrontLatSpread11.jpg"">&nbsp; <IMG style=""WIDTH: 350px; HEIGHT: 262px"" height=204 src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/dougmoore/DougBackDoubleBi11.jpg"" width=306></P>
<P><IMG src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/dougmoore/DougSideChest11.jpg""></P>
<P>My posing was <EM>terrible</EM>.&nbsp; My post with these pictures on EA explains, ""Last week I was tested @ 7% bf, weighing 180 at 5'4""-5'5.""&nbsp; </P>
<P>There is no way in hell I am 7% in these pictures.</P>
<P>A week later these pictures were posted in the same thread <A href=""http://www.extreme-athlete.com/forums/showthread.php?t=23652"">http://www.extreme-athlete.com/forums/showthread.php?t=23652</A>:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/dougmoore/DougLatSpread10.jpg""><IMG src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/dougmoore/DougMostMuscular10.jpg""><IMG src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/dougmoore/DougAbs102.jpg""></P>
<P>Now before you think I am posting this to publicly humiliate myself with how terrible my posing was and how fat I was pre-contest: I am posting this as a reminder of how much progress can be made in 2-3 months.&nbsp; I am not insinuating that everything turned out <EM>perfect</EM>, but rather that with enough work and focus, you can polish a turd into a cubic zyrconia.</P>
<P>At this point, about 9 weeks out, I really had my diet set into motion.&nbsp; My caloric intake was consistently 300-500 calories below maintenance, cardio workouts were progressively being added into my routine, and my macronutrient breakdown was optimal.&nbsp; The results of my diet and training changes were obvious in progress photos taken a few weeks later, April 27, 2005:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/dougmoore/DougBackDoubleBi092.jpg""><IMG src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/dougmoore/DougFrontDoubleBi09.jpg""><IMG src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/dougmoore/DougFrontLatSpread09.jpg""></P>
<P>Clearly, I was leaning up, but also you can tell I still had no clue how to flex my lats.&nbsp; My body fat tester gave me a reading of 5% with her calipers at this point.&nbsp; Again, I think she under-estimated it just about every time.&nbsp; The important thing to note is that the reading was going down.&nbsp; So even if her measurements were wildly off base, at least they were consistently dropping.</P>
<P>One week later (8 weeks out), I kinda learned how to show my lats! Yay!</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/dougmoore/DougFrontLatSpread08.jpg""></P>
<P>This is the thread with all the pictures from Week 10 and 9, along with quite a bit of diet info:</P>
<P><A href=""http://www.extreme-athlete.com/forums/showthread.php?t=23923"">http://www.extreme-athlete.com/forums/showthread.php?t=23923</A></P>
<P>At this point, Spring Term exams and the Spring/Summer break interrupted the previously consistent progression photos.&nbsp; I did well in my classes and remained staunchly dedicated to my diet.&nbsp; I never went out for any social occasions, didn't have any drinks, and continued to count my macronutrients and calories, all the while changing my intake numbers to reflect my weight's current maintenace needs.&nbsp; I practiced posing whenever I could in my bedroom and anytime I visited the restroom.&nbsp; Doing so helped me improve my mind-muscle connection and even led to better pumps in the gym.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;Five or Six weeks later, we posted pictures May 20th.&nbsp; My trunks had come in, and it was getting&nbsp;close to crunch time.&nbsp; I weighed 166 at this point and had averaged about 1.33 lbs/week of weight loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;caliper reading at this point was&nbsp;~ 4.2%.</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/dougmoore/DougAbs042.jpg"">&nbsp;<IMG src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/dougmoore/DougSideTri04.jpg""></P>
<P><IMG src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/dougmoore/DougMostMuscular04.jpg""></P>
<P>The posing had improved and the diet clearly worked well, but again, both still needed to be fine tuned.&nbsp; Two weeks passed as cardio was done 3-5x per week... Sometimes it was HIIT, other times it was medium intensity post-workout.&nbsp; I don't feel like going into detail right now.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So I was chugging right along, following&nbsp;Layne Norton's dietary advice like a starving fiend (bad pun intended).&nbsp; The carb depletion was in full effect up until Wednesday when I weighed myself post-cardio: 159 pounds.&nbsp; The entire time I had been training to pose in the Middleweight divison which was 154.25-176.50.&nbsp; I was not unnerved by this, because I figured at my height I could win on proportion and having more mass per inch against the other competitors.&nbsp; However, I was convinced by a gym-goer named Rob to try and make it under 154.25 so I could compete in the Lightweight divison.&nbsp; Rob had competitive bodybuilding experience and his dietary advice and motivation during cardio sessions would prove crucial in the final days:</P>
<P>It was decided that I would, by any means necessary, drop into the lightweight division.&nbsp; This meant extreme manipulation of fluid and sodium intake.&nbsp; Thursday I would wear two layers of clothing during 2 high intensity cardio sessions of 30-45 minutes.&nbsp; The top layer would be a heavy sweater and sweat pants, the under layer being shorts and along sleeve shirt.&nbsp; I would also wear this during my 35 minute session in the sauna, as per my own masochistic tendencies.&nbsp; I lost 1.5 pounds at the sauna from sweating, and for three hours following the experience, I was the most agitated, enraged, violent&nbsp;person on the face of the Earth:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://laniels.org/~slaniel/cheney_day_of_terror_files/cheney.jpg"">&nbsp; </P>
<P>I was not very pleasant that day.</P>
<P>Friday, the day of the weigh-ins, I had to perform two more cardio sessions like the one I detailed above, while only drinking a half gallon of water.&nbsp; By about 7:00pm I made weight at the Holiday Inn, coming in at 152.75 lbs.&nbsp; As soon as I stepped off the scale, I chugged water and ate a bunch of apricots.&nbsp; I was very happy:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://www.fsu.com/media/2004/04/09/vp_dick_cheney_01.jpg""></P>
<P>My body had resembled that of a malnourished Ethiopian bastard child, but at least it was vascular!&nbsp; After the worst two days of my life, I had the absolute pleasure of carbing up the night before the show.&nbsp; Every hour and a half to&nbsp;2 hours, I had a 60-70 carb meal to fill my body back up to a healthier state.&nbsp; These meals were heavy in sweet potatoes, bananas, oatmeal, and raisins.&nbsp; By bed time, 12:30am, I was ecstatic.&nbsp; I was so gleeful from the ingestion of carbs that I couldn't fall asleep for a couple of hours.&nbsp; I was gleeful, but also feeling very confident that I would do well the next day.&nbsp; I awoke at 4:00am to eat some sweet potato, then back to sleep until SHOW DAY...</P>

"event","Here's an obligatory post to basically keep this thing active.  That and my last post wasn't really anything original...

I choose not to write about anything too personal here because I really don't like people knowing my business.  It astonishes me how important it is for people to know the intimate details of others' personal lives.  I starkly hint at that in my previous post.  Imposing myself in others' matters is a practice I wish never to partake in.  I am *not* singling anyone out- I can relate this strongly to Thoreau's ideas in Walden.  One of his ideas was that many neglect self-development.  Again, this is general.  And in neglecting self-development for any number of reasons, they become more infatuated with the goings-on around them.  Being keen of  these events can stimulate conversation with other undeveloped people who would otherwise have little to discuss.  

Never again in this journal will I write of a future material purchase... Be it a car, videogame, computer, etc.  

Never again do I hope to fritter away with mindless details of any particular girl I might be ""crushing"" on.

Never again will I write of any run-of-the mill daily events.  I'll still be working out, attending class, and working.  End of story.

I wish to use this journal as more of a reflection on thoughts I feel can be universally applied.  

This is what happens when I am bored on a Thursday night.

"event","""About Me...""  Like Thoreau, I imagine myself to be the only person for whom I can speak of with truest confidence.  While it seems rightfully egocentric to write of myself, I may not write of others whom I know less truthfully.

Yet I observe that a majority of men have no such similar difficulties.  These men seek and destroy contrary thought- Their entire lives measured by the accumulation of plasma screens and custom ring tones, whilst the free accumulation of self-substance is placed on Blue Light Special for immediate disposal.

The serfs of our globe's factories are controlled by religion and the interests of the ruling class- Coerced to believe it is of their best interest to seek a ""better"" life at the conclusion of their personal, depressing realities.

These interests of the ruling class are upheld by our Bald Eagle...  As often as balding is assigned with wisdom and clarity, our symbol of unabashed ignorance is everything but.  Under its omniscient eye, dissent and free speech is destroyed, and the common good is defocated upon similar to a car's hood.        

I do not support religion.  Theology has severly hindered the growth of science and human reasoning.  Religious dogma provides a foundation for obedience to national laws.  To attack government is to attack religion, and vice versa.  A world of discouraging logic is truly deplorable.  

Condeming reason breeds murder in the name of God... breeds hatred, idiocy, ignorance, and intolerance, all the while grooming loyalty:  A blind sort of loyalty proclaimed a societal 20/20, propagated by the most illusory and deceptive of all eyes. 

I seek respite in independent, rational thought.  A world free of the mainpulative fingers of The Fates, or the media for that matter.  *Self* education is the most powerful tool we as a people have: To go beyond asphyxiating National Anthems and the biased history books of boarding schools and see that there is something more.  

- I wrote this about a month ago as I was really into Walden and my Marxism class.  Some of the themes are nearly written verbatum from my class studies while others are truly from my mind.  I took it off of Facebook as it was a very strong outburst and those just meeting me on there may find it a bit stand-off ish.  So I copy and paste it here for those interested and for self-preservation.  It may still be tweaked."

Square's RPGs, especially those composed by Nobuo Uematsu have easily some of the greatest music in videogame history.  I used to goto sleep to music from FF6 when I had my own computer w/the songs on it.  Dare I say, every song has an... EPIC feel to it!  Epic, I tell ya!  So epic, in fact, that if one man had to, I would allow Mr. Uematsu to bukkake me.  And now I <i> must </i> digress...

For my Ben moment of the day, I shall share my recent weight lifting feat: Max Deadlift of 495.  I should be able to do more considering my strength on leg presses and hacks, but my form is always changing from week to week.  I had all the troops around watching and supporting with rallying war cries and primal grunts.  The rep took what felt like an hour.  Ugh.

I'm hungry and I am hosting some friends for another Halo 2 Asskicking session.  Adios muchachos/as"

"event","It scares me when people who are somewhat active in the independent wrestling scene have such a vague idea of who Shane Douglas is.

Then again, this is the same group of people that refers to Degeneration X as ""Old School.""  It makes me feel old as fuck.  It's hard to grasp that there are people just now beginning to watch wrestling who have access to all the lingo workers use through the Internet.  They then prance around as if they are ""smarts.""  It befuddles me and I am reminded of it as people tell me they ""kinda remember"" Shane Douglas.

To me he was never the end-all be all of technical wonders in the ring, but he was instrumental in the formation of Extreme Championship Wrestling... And even back when I was a worker, I was dumbfounded by all of the marks in the business who had never seen ECW or even heard of it.  This company was THE innovative independent circuit while the WWF had Doink the Clown feuding with M.O.M. and WCW promoted thrillers such as The Guardian Angel vs Erik Watts.  And most of the people who read this will have no clue who most of the people are that I just mentioned.  Oh well...

Had I still been a worker, I would have been honored to work in front of Shane Douglas.  I respect the man for all of the years he has put into the business and all of his contributions to ECW.  He's no Misawa, Kawada, Angle, or Benoit, but that doesn't matter.  And then there's his entire saga with Hall, Nash, HBK, Vince, etc, and his black-balling.  Unfortunately, some new fans will only vaguely recognize his name and will see him as just an old ""grandpa of wrestling"" like the assholes that disrespect Flair.    

Shit, I was honored when I worked the same card as Hector Guerrero, the f'ng GobbledyGooker.  To most he's a joke, but to me he's a guy who trained his ass off in a family of wrestling and his last name alone commands respect.  To top it off, he was humble and replied that it was an honor to share company with myself.  

No one should mistake this as a tirade against new fans.  It is unfair to chastize them for lacking wrestling knowledge and taking advantage of technology that promotes throwing around wrestling lingo while not truly having a grasp for the business.  So far, this has been a reflection of my own personal history of wrestling and how disparate it is from the current landscape of the industry.

To this day, I have always looked back and wondered ""What could have been,"" in regard to my wrestling experience.  Certainly I could never work for the Fed, but to have the opportunity to train with and share company with some of the legends of the business is remarkable.  To some these people are just guys ""earning their paycheck,"" but to me they are figurative blue-collar workers whom I admire.  I am apologetic to those who helped me along the way for my decision to stop as I entered college, because a lot of people back then would selflessly share knowledge to better you as a worker.  I will not consider trying it again as I cannot committ myself financially, mentally, or physically to the task.  The best I can do now is look back to wrestlers of the past and show my earnest respect and do the same for those who bust their asses today.  

To all of the modern fans, I ask simply to not allow technology to overwhelm your senses.  If a match was entertaining, do not meticulously search for flaws or criticize the men and women doing their jobs.  It is a wrestling cliche, but these people do not go to your workplace and objectively dissect how you do your job.  I also encourage all fans to try their best to indulge in the very rich history of professional wrestling in hopes of gaining a new found respect for the business.

"event","I went home for Thanksgiving and got my GOBBLE on... It was delicious and really good to see some of my family again.  If only my Dad could somehow contact me so I could see him too!  He leaves everyone out of the loop so often and when he needs something, suddenly we see him.  Oh well.

Anyways, back to the positives, I got to spend some great time back home and took a box of pictures back with me.  It has all kinds of memories, some of which I had completely forgotten!  The day after I volunteered to hang out with my brother's wife who had just given birth a week ago to my niece Sofia.  He says she was in a depressed mood, but she was perfectly fine while I was there.  What bugged her was that she couldn't go anywhere or do anything than, or for the immediate future.  Apparently the baby needs supervision 24/7, and it's suggested she doesn't take her out in public for several weeks to avoid illness.  So spending time with all of them really served me well this week.  

The same day I saw Mandy, my brother's wife, I signed up at and worked out at Powerhouse.  It's definitely a 'bodybuilder's gym' hole in the wall.  Only two women were there, and neither of them were remotely attractive.  It'll help me focus on the task at hand and not get interrupted by people who know me at work.  Mixing work with my leisure activity really frustrates me.  

And today I was able to hang out with probably my best friend, Adam.  He's trying to find a new place to move into, and it's possible I might have to help him.  He's counting on me possibly moving in with him to help pay for a 2 bedroom place.  It would be cheaper than where I'm at now, and I always prefer a lesser number of people.  I have some time to make up my mind, but if I were to leave Reflections, I'd need to find someone to sub-lease it to.  


Hmm I guess the only other news is that before the rain today was absolutely awesome outside.  I sat out at a table and ate my tuna and drank water while taking in the semi-fresh polluted Tampa air.  I like being alone without much noise or energy to disrupt me
Thats all"

I should make a living writing people's papers.  In a few hours time, I created a masterpiece of bullshit, in which, I wrote a fictitious essay detailing a four hour observational study I spent at a retirement home.  It met the three page requirement and all of the paper's vague instructions.  I have applauded myself with self-appreciation all night and encourage everyone to read it (upon request) and henceforth shower me with adulation and praise.  My paper, guaranteed, is better than those legitimately written by  poor saps who spent time with smelly geezers.  I could dedicate this whole journal to my feat of genius...

I think I shall do exactly that.  The only other stuff I could rabble about has already been brought up in other journals detailing the past few days of  party activities.  

The moral of this anecdote is that I am the next evolutionary step in human intelligence and its expansion in the realms of imagination and bullshit."

For about a week I had a mellow almost weed-induced high for a while, and it felt pretty good.  Didn't have a worry in the world.  Sure I'm single, but I've always been single.  So life as usual.  

I just don't act upon it because the entire process of becoming ""un-single"" is phony as hell.  Each person plays their cards and finds out what strategy works.  There are the usual strategies like the ""Reformed Asshole"" but there are other lesser known ones that seem to work like gold... For example:

1.) False Sincerity- Just let the girl talk and inquire about all kinds of things that you really could care less about.  I'm not a big fan of this.  

2.) Woe is Me- Girls have treated me poorly and once you hear of it, you'll fall for me and fellate me until my pangs cease to be.

3.) Life of the Party- The loudest Neanderthal in the room naturally garners the most attention.  They are loud because they either starve for attention or are just fucking morons.  Chick says ""Hey, I'd like to be where the attention's at too!""  

4.) Hook n Sinker- Trick them into thinkin your quality, than turn into a complete dick.  It leaves a glimmer of hope that some day ""Mr. Quality"" will return.

5.) I'm A GOOD Guy I Swear! - Don't wanna be a playa no mo.  Profess your moral qualities and denounce any sort of hedonistic activity.  For you are the ""Anti-Guy"" and defy all stereotypes... or at least you want her to believe so.

Bah, ""I'm just hatin..."" I'll wait for some dumb fuck to write that in my comment box.  I was just hoping to write a lil laundry list of lame approaches to hooking up without sounding too cliche.  I feel like I failed, but tough noogies...

What else... I took ephedra pre-workout yesterday and that just put me in a super mood.  </sarcasm off>

Umm... I had the distinct pleasure of going to a party to help ben meet a girl.  Oh I left one out!

6.) Attain the services of a random friend to glorify your personal attributes.  Said friend can know you for years or for merely days.  Convince them of you holding as many good qualities as possible, stir slowly, and allow the spy to sing your praises to object of adoration.

So anyone reading this journal has probably known me for at least a month by now... Find a pretty girl (preferably Latino), and use the following adjectives to describe me: ""Nice,"" ""Good Guy,"" ""Works Out, ""is Just like You,"" and as much of a stretch as it may seem, ""Hot Ass.""  It's about time someone did a favor for me in this realm.

Grand Theft Auto is going well, but the territory battles are annoying me and I only have one new one so far.  To me, they are roadblocks keeping me from completing missions and advancing the story line.  There's enough killing and ammo wasted in mission already.  Good thing for the Vigilante R3 bug.  

I missed/forgot a 10am group meeting for our big project on Thursday... I'm a dick.  That's what I get for dedicating my night to a retarded party.  All the get-together did was re-affirm my mindset of staying in the house as much as I can.  As I said in the last journal, I won't forget the select few that I actually click with.  

This journal has accomplished nothing and is way too long.  If you've read this far, you need to go away and do something more interesting.  Unless you are intrigued in a Jerry Springer manner and wish to read more of my self-loathing.  I wish I had entrance music like he does.

Food, video games, music, reading, and self-motivated exercise is where it's at.  *Thinking* is where it's at.

And if I have to stop doing so to follow the pre-constructed rituals of sweeping a girl off her feet, than I'd rather not.  I won't dummy myself down into one of the previous strategies/characters I described earlier.  

As this rambling mess of irrelevance comes to a close, I can only look forward to another pointless waste of space comment from Sedrick likely containing one of the following phrases, ""Too Long,"" ""You Suck,"" ""You're short,"" or ""Boring.""  I'd rather not see them, but I feel that these comments are a universal law of live journal entries.

I'm gonna go stuff my face now."

School is annoying.  Classes are a waste of time and the only good thing out of it is the people you meet.  Keep in touch with people that you match up well with.

If you can get by paying for an apartment without going to college, I highly recommend it.  I feel like it is a complete waste of time.  My track will take me into a workplace I don't feel like I will enjoy at all.  

Prescribing workout routines and preaching the same cliche bullshit about health does not sound stimulating at all.  Not only is it not stimulating, but it is also poor paying and takes away from my own enjoyment of exercise...  I would be making money off of people because of their own irresponsible health habits and their insecure self images.  

Give me a job that makes me think.  Not something where I have a workout plan memorized for Scenarios A-Z, and than throw them out to people as if they are automatons.  

Had I the choice, I would prefer to just get out of college, somehow find a job that would embrace my mindset, and find a group of chill, relaxed people to hang with and wax philosophical.  Sophomore year was great for me in this way.  

Hell maybe I could find a different major I enjoy.  I just know I've been in a huge funk for the past probably 6-8 months and need to change direction somehow to get out of it.  

All of you need to check out Iron & Wine.  They are becoming somewhat known because of their single on the Garden State OST.  Ben, I have lots of their stuff d/l'd in the LW folder and the mydocs/downloads/bigmuffinluv.  Their music makes me relax, have a good day in spite of my funk at times, and really long for some ganja lovin... Good night."

My car is still down but maybe tomorrow i can get it worked out.

Cant wait to get the ""cutting stuff"" here.  Abs are comin back even without them already.

I woke up to some bad family related news but I feel like writing further about it in my journal would just be exploiting it.  Sympathy is for pussies that can't handle shit on their own... But-  So is religion.

And I missed the fucking bus, so that is why I am writing this gay journal at our computer lab.
I'm hungry and now I have to go stand outside like a bum and wait for my luxurious ride.  Adios."

"event","So I make a few suggestions and it means I'm whining?

They were words of advice.  I know you were kidding, Dave!  

Dave: Who is this guy??? He's the alter-ego of SEDRICK!  Oh My God, cue the Kayfabe Gods of Hell to strike me dead.  He still wants to be Mike Sullivan by the way.

I wanna shoot on somethin so bad, but than I'd be a jerk.  Shucks.

Got half of my financial aid check in the mail and it sucked a big turd.  The next one should be bling blingin though!  

This one is for my biggest fan: I DID LEGS TODAY AND IT FELT REALLY GOOD!  HACKS, LEG PRESSES, EVEN CALVES!  How bout dat?!

Boobies galore at the gym.  One gym-rat named Donnell whom one of my fanboys finds hubba hubba insists on talking to me when I'm doing abs or stretching post-workout.  I think she's ""Eh"" like a 6/10.  Peeps need to understand that Boobies DO NOT distract me when I am working out!  Unless they are naked boobies.  Some day I will devote an entire journal to them.  

Bumming rides from people is gay.  So is riding the bus with smelly, unhygienic bums.  Than again, I fit in perfectly in regards to hygiene.

Never miss an opportunity to dis yourself!  People with egos too big enough to do that need to die.  As do dumpy guys with no sense of humor.  

Gotta get Saved! and maybe Fahrenheit (Propaganda) 9/11 to quench my thirst for Bush Hate-Mongering."

Don't ever tell Sedrick Strong that he has small arms.  He will shoot on you in front of his wrestler friends and try to make you feel bad!  Big Meanie. No one can belittle me anymore than I already am.  Har har.

No more short jokes for the next... ehh 24 hours?  Believe it or not, nothing you (the readers) or anyone else (the non readers) can think up is original.  I've heard it all, so please, shut the fuck up. Hey here's another idea! 

Call me by my birth-given name! :-0
Not Dougie Fresh, Dougster, Dougie _____, or any form of ""Big Man"" nickname.  There's more to me than lifting heavy shit.  Me llamo Doug y soy mas que weight lifting!  ""Bossman"" is also discouraged since Ray Traylor's dead.  Thanks.

Don't be a 1-Issue Voter.  Even though our country's politics are fucking retarded and we are run by big business, don't vote based on 1 thing.  My sister in law votes solely on abortion.  Therefore, Hitler v2.0 already has her vote for the 2004 election.  I hate dumb people.  If you have a witty comeback comment for that, you are one of the dumb people I hate.

Do not goto college unless you are certain to find a high paying job that'll pay off your debts.  All I'm doing now is accruing debt because I followed the ""Everyone successful goes to college"" mantra.  Piss off.

Stay away from Englewood, Florida.  It's a town filled with misery and superegos. My cousin hit the nail on the head in his journal: http://www.livejournal.com/users/engineeringpimp

Most of all, if you ignore all of the above advice, please remember...

WEAR

SUNSCREEN."

"event","Been a while and one or two people actually cared enough to mention that to me.  So to appease my fan club of two, I thought I would update.

I'm taking classes, like everyone else.  Gotta wake up early cuz I have class @ 8 3x a week... 

To remind people I've already told, I weigh ~200 lbs now.  MY stuff came in, and it has worked pretty well, seeing as how I was around 185-190 before.  Decided to do it for four weeks and tempt the bitch tits gods.  Unfortunately it seems that Ben has never been on their good side since birth.  Nipples McGee.

Sexy Weikel has blessed us with his presence two days in a row... Whenever a natural disaster is looming, he comes over for male bonding in the candle lit dark.  As long as his mangled athlete's foot ridden... feet don't invade my personal space I'm Ok with it.  

I don't think I'll update the gymlift journal because it's a chore.  Short version: Did Shoulders, a lil above average weights.  Chicks love juicer doug.

Bobby Tinsley needs to cum on my face.  Goodbye."

Because unlike some people, I like ordering from reputable companies.  :)

Unfortunately in the frenzy I had with the aforementioned ""some people,"" I probably lost $100 to a non-existent company.  

See how I only update when the sauce comes in?  It's cause I have a boring life.  No girlfriends, no drugs, no love, nothin.  ""You just have to wait!"" proclaim the uplifting motivators... ""I just want to slap you,"" thinks I.

With all that missing, (I) seek solace in trivial things like playing piano and lifting weights.  Thousands of dollars are sucked out in buying the ""right food"" or pill to ""get big.""  As if that all matters in the long-run.    Hobbies have no choice in being a part of your life.  Other people you may care about *do*.  

Keep running mileage with distractions, while any compatible lady I may care about in the slightest may feel free to drift away from me.  

My epitaph may read: ""Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda.""    

I hate sappy reflective bullshit.  

Feel free to flame away and mock me or leave cliche, uplifting, inspirational crap.  I'll laugh at the trolling and scoff at the latter."

"event","From Wikipedia:

Lilith is a female Mesopotamian night demon believed to harm male children. She is often identified as the first wife of Adam and sometimes thought to be the mother of all incubi and succubi, a legend that arose in the Middle Ages. Lilith is also sometimes considered to be the paramour of Satan.

In medieval legend, a succubus is a demon which takes the form of a female to seduce men in dreams to have sexual intercourse. They draw energy from the men to sustain themselves, often until the point of exhaustion or death of the victim. From mythology and fantasy, <b>Lilith</b> and the <b>Lilin</b> (Jewish), <b>Lilitu</b> (Sumerian) and Rusalka (Slavic) were succubi.

And you know what?

I don't care.

I guess that's how it works."

Emily was done with me quickly; her new social circle made the thirty minute drive to Montevallo a hassle, especially for someone who probably wasn't that interested in the first place.  Thus my world became different.  Montevallo became infinitely more interesting - once one exits the high school world and visits the world of university students and young adults, one realizes quickly that one has misjudged this quaint little town.

Also previously misconceived was the size of the dating pool here.  And as we know, with the introduction of any attractive female with even the slightest bit in common with me comes the near-instantaneous onset of self-generated intense feeling on my part, thus several co-workers became the unknowing recipients of a trademark John Paul Crush, the kind that simmers in my brain for days and goes nowhere because I'm terrified.

However, the genesis of the week found me with a small amount of courage, and Monday began with my intentions secured: I would, that night, have secured a one-on-one social engagement with the girl I had my sights set on, a co-worker.  A bit after getting off work myself and mowing the lawn, I ventured to Eclipse with the intention of being charming.

In my mind, a small globe had recently come to a place of balance.  My thoughts had somewhat leveled, and this globe no longer spun out of control as it once had.  I walked out of the front door at Eclipse, and sat down on the porch.  As I did this, a hand gripped the sphere and spun it, like a top, at light speed.

At first, this dizzying sensation was sourced in blatant and unexpected female attention, from an interesting one, and it seemed in order that perhaps my recent bout with feeling undesirable would come to a close, even for a brief moment.

She invited me back to her apartment, abruptly, so we could show one another our various artworks.  Feeling self-conscious but excited, I excused myself with her from the porch and drove her home.

Then a new chapter began, a dream sequence.  In the following days, all my numerous crushes and my frustrations with Emily were wiped out in one fell swoop.  

I began to understand something I had forgotten... that electric charge between my finger and her neck, that atomic explosion contained in a pair of good-night hugs.  That ache in my gut that won't let me eat.  That delirious, terrifying happiness.  That feeling of life not even seeming real anymore.

And then all of this other stuff: the horrifyingly complete honesty, the continuing revelations of my darker secrets, and the feeling of being understood, the feeling that someone else is thinking a lot of the exact same weird shit that I'm thinking.

As tradition holds, this is terrifying because I don't know what she's thinking about the situation while I know exactly what I'm thinking.  But it's also terrifying because it's new and it's wonderful, and I'm not having to convince myself of anything or question what I'm feeling.

So it goes.  The dream sequence continues; tonight was a surreal nightmare at work and elsewhere.  Who knows what the morning will bring.  Who ever knows what the morning will bring."

Of no import, we learn the secrets of machines
And speak of frames and thieves.
Brain begins browning at lunch
And sours further through documentaries
Sky's got poison in the white clouds.
We fold century-old drops, dusting the stage with pigment
Untying and retying until chased off.
Moonchildren audition flips with no hitch
Samuel French and his Hawaiian sausage wolf.
I slap a patch into the sampler and run.
At the ranch, there are three hours of verbal torture
Where our eyes rain the bed
But then he speaks of the secrets of machines
Of the information sponge
And we breathe easy enough for spaghetti and television.
When our limbs entangle it feels like singing."

http://www.ninfant.com/media/RadioHitMusical.mp3

There 'tis.  I ain't finished a song by myself in over two years.  I think I'm still good at it.

Here's what them lixx:

On the morning in the sun
Humid air in human lungs
Tumble through the soaking yard
Sweating quarts in mother's car
Hey Helene, my room's all new
Melting colours dripped on you
Love my neighbour while I'm young
After noon, another one

Wind it came to bend the trees
Basement walls come cradle me
Will your hands come quiver here
When the thunder cracks your ears?
Morning comes with new cartoons
Television wash your wounds
I am safety, hour three
December's dim memory

Oh Helene, when I think I'm seventeen
You look at me like you can't see
I was the boy who sang in radio plays
And we sat together, cursing the weather
Don't you remember me, Helene?

How we warmed the cement floor
While we cowered, pressed record
And flashlit faces fashioned worlds
Radio hit musicals
And out we poured some melody
Lily-soft and sickly-sweet
Who, you'll wonder when you're old
Was that faceless five-year-old?

Oh Helene, how am I at seventeen
Oh, whatever happened to me?
When will we make more of the radio plays?
And when will we ever huddle together?
Don't you remember me, Helene?
Don't you remember me, Helene?
Don't you remember me, Helene?"

"event","So I took a nap this afternoon, because I felt like shit in so many ways.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I dreamt quite vividly, remembered all of it, and it was deliciously absurd!

I'm not sure I remember the chronology exactly, but here's the way I THINK it went:

Meghan shows up at my house and says she wants to get drunk, so I'm like ""OK, let's go to the store and get some alcohol.""  We jump on something that's sort of like a cross between a car and a motorcycle, and ride to Lucky's, the grocery store in town, but when we get there, all the lights are on and the windows are boarded up and we can't even get into the parking lot because it's been blocked.  Meghan was like ""Oh, Lucky's is closed, you didn't know that?  It's late.  We have to go to Wal-Mart.""  So I back up and turn around awkwardly, and begin making my way towards Wal-Mart, but the road is covered in construction equipment and dirt and all manner of crap, and I'm quite terrified; at some point I realize that I'm drunk.  I can't seem to maneuver the vehicle correctly.  I'm getting very scared.

Eventually I wind up at some place that's a cross between North Village and the Royal National Hotel in London.  Some quite attractive girl is sitting on the couch, crying, and I feel terribly awkward.  I ask her if she's OK, and said for her to let me know if there's anything I can do.  All of a sudden, I realize that it's not a girl at all, but a dude.  With a beard.  She says there's nothing I can do.  I wander into a bedroom, and there's a bowl of cereal sitting on a computer desk next to a computer.  I make myself a bowl of cereal, and I'm amused by the flatworm-shaped pieces inside the cereal.  I eat the cereal for a while, and wander back into the other room, where three other guys - supposedly the androgynous couch-weeper's roommates, and I introduce myself, and realize that I've wandered into a private residence.  They all don't seem to care; one of them points out that everyone in the room has a scruffy beard.  I continue eating my cereal, but then realize that some of the flatworm-shaped pieces are moving.  I recoil in disgust, realizing that I've been eating flatworms, and I start wanting to return to the computer to see what one should do in case of such an event, but there are huge, three-foot-long red glowing flatworms in the way, and they begin to attack me, constricting their bodies around mine.  This is TERRIFYING.  I begin to tear them apart, wondering if they will stop coming, but they keep on... I ask the guys in the apartment what I should do, and they tell me to just kill them.  They continue swarming all over me until finally I think I wake up, scared out of my mind.

I went back to sleep, though, and found myself at First Baptist Church in Knoxville, the church I grew up in, and for some reason I'm there with the improv troupe.  We're there to play some pranks.  I do all manner of wandering around, from floor to floor, wandering up and down the staircases.  Occasionally I see people, but I try to avoid them, because I don't feel like I'm supposed to be there.  Some strange music is coming from the hallway on the third floor.  All of a sudden, I realize that I'm unbelievably stoned, and movement has become next to impossible.  But I need water, so I make my way to the water fountain, avoiding eye contact with anyone.  The halls are dark.

Ian has set up some giant machine on the landing in one of the stairwells, a machine that will blow up an enormous number of balloons and then flood the room.  I'm not sure why we're doing this, but it's some sort of hilarious prank.  I feel bad; I don't want to do this to my old church, but I don't say anything... I just run upstairs when the machine goes on.  I hear keys on the fourth floor and duck away, because it's someone who's about to catch me!  Eventually, somehow I find the rest of the troupe, and they're in a small room with my roommate Andrew.  Some authority figure from the church shows up and chastises us viciously, and I feel terrible.  Andrew is pissed at all of us.

The end."

The bed crooks his broken finger.
There's more in dreams, little one,
More technicolor girls with fire eyes
That make your stomach vibrate.
And though they jump at you now
And flames drop from ducts to ignite the floor,
Turn the lights out, little one.
There's years left to you to dig
And excavate more alien skeletons
That dance with you in night hours,
That shake their hollow eyes
And squint at you in the dark.
You're picking at the wounds
And making new ones for her.
We taught you to think broadly
And cradle the souls around you.
Oh, your trembling limbs survive
And tremble away the sorrows.
Keep them to yourself, little one;
They are sharp metal in her brain.
With Jesus in your veins, keep bleeding.
Keep bleeding, little one,
And tremble away the sorrows.
Watch your friends dissolve in bottles,
As you become uninteresting
And dissolve in mason jars
While their eyes squint at you.

Turn the lights off, little one;
Her eyes will squint at you no more.
Keep your staggered breaths contained
And don't let your gasps in her ear.
With Jesus in your veins, keep bleeding.
Keep bleeding, little one,
And one day the technicolor girls will escape
And wrap you in blankets
And crawl into warmth with you.
Until then curl your toes under
And soak your pillows with memories
Of one short week when you forgot...
When you forgot your darkness,
When the world dissolved and there were only two,
And the lights came on and the paints were bright."

The rain splashes in my eyes, leaking on your clothes

And oh, the canyons crack
And oh, the rivers wail
And oh, how you burn me when your breath sweeps through the room

I dream in colors, but my paint has dried and dulled and worn
While you splash bright pigment in my face
And our fingertips trace alien silhouettes
And black shadows breathe on us together

And oh, how my arms explode that they can't hold you"

Up until nearly 6 am, but having the most fun I've had in a long time.  Serotonin levels jacked up like a mauhlfucka, I'm sure.  For some reason, I've remained energetic today, despite getting a scant 2 1/2 hours of sleep last night, and barely more than that the night before.

I'm feeling like an explosion lately.  I'm still frustrated as hell with Furman, with drug testing, and with bullshit, but everything else in my life seems to be going to well that that's just a sidenote, almost.  And yes, SEEMS to be going well; all the prospects for good news have yet to be confirmed, but that makes for an awfully exciting time, doesn't it?  An up-and-down kind of exciting, yes, but at least it's a feeling that makes me seem more alive than I usually do.

Ninfant be all fleshed out, and we've probably got a rehearsal space, and all that's gonna get kicked off really soon, which is exciting as all hell, and I'm ready (ohhh sooo ready) for that to happen.  Pretty much more excited about that than most things I could get excited about.

And girls are weird/exciting/wonderful/confusing.  Ones that hang out in your apartment until nearly six in the morning especially, though confusion certainly enters into it.  I just wish I had some clarity, that someone would come along and elucidate this situation.  Before last night, I just sensed a pending possibility, but after last night, I can't really keep my mind off of it.  People shouldn't be so much damn fun to be around.  It's otherworldly.

I just hope things sort themselves out in a manner that finds itself suitable to my own well-being, and my own sanity.  Plus I'm ready for karma to balance out from all the shit I've been through in the past month.  Everything looks like it's heading that way, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but I seem to get pretty vulnerable when I get my hopes up (Stratford, anyone?).  Of course, this is a bit more promising than THAT situation, but still..."

"event","Man, beer.

You haven't had beer until you've been to Munich.  I swear.  The first night we were here, after an INSANE day of travel that included just BARELY catching the 10:43 train out of Paris (the doors nearly closed on Mary), we went to an Indian restaurant and ate some niiiice Indian food and ordered some beers... and we were all SO BLOWN AWAY.  It's like nothing I've ever had before.  Mmmmmm, beer.

Wintry, icy weather, and we're all staying in our cozy hostel room.  We had to move today into a different room, but this one actually has a private shower.  We're still just watching music videos all the time, hoping Snoop Dogg will make an appearance.  It's hard to figure out exactly what to do here.. we're so short on cash, and the weather is so nasty.  But it's fun, and Munich is really awesome.  The people are verrry nice, helping us with our pronounciation and stuff.  The first night, I learned how to count to ten in German by watching phone sex commercials, and I've added quite a few more numbers by watching the endless ringtone ads.  I could probably learn to speak the language pretty quickly if I were here for an extended period of time.  Especially if I had some books.  It hasn't been as much of a problem as I thought it would be, because most people speak English... but I'm trying to avoid that, and I'm using what little German I have whenever I can.  Knowing numbers helps... a lot.

Annnnnd I'm getting pretty lonely and homesick as well.  I miss people.  We're having a lot of fun, the three of us (though things got a bit strained yesterday)... but I miss people back in the US.  And my stuff.  Pretty eager to get back to my computer and my gee-tar and recording gear... and my family...

So we'll find something to do for the rest of the time we're here, and then it's off to have some crazzzzzzy adventures in Amsterdam.  I'm not looking forward to THAT at all, am I..."

Anyway, 'Visiting Friends' was dripping down my skull and I was struck my a sudden momentary loneliness combined with a sedate complacency.  Despite me declaring my having nothing to look forward to, I have plenty to look forward to, and it's only my childish reluctancy to give up hope that keeps me moving forward.  I'm visiting Furman when I get back, meeting new people, maybe someone who I can lay in bed with and let some foreign music wash over us while we lay and define one another in muffled conversations stunted by timid make-out sessions that gradually grow in intensity.  Perhaps my visit will give me wonderful things to think about over Christmas break before I finally make my return to school, while Adam and I work on the Coffee Cantata II, and then the press blitz for the first Ninfant album, trying to make that cash back... Christmas itself, visiting my family, my friends back in Montevallo...  I try to keep a positive outlook.  Oh, and hey, New Year's should be brilliant as well.

I'm going to miss Europe though.  But hey, I've still got a few weeks."

"event","Drifting around London with Sung Tongs on my iPod, letting the last vestiges of slight stoned-ness wisp away to the streets on my way to the Internet cafe to work on my damn project, which has the current problem of totally lacking direction.  Sung Tongs is glorious for sweeping through the streets of this city, though; its organic folkiness combined with that slight primeval pulse behind it provides quite a lovely contrast to the busy urban landscape, and creates a feeling of warm safetiness behind the hum.

I'm alarmingly content, even though events all around me in my life have been rather unfortunate lately to a degree; the election, of course, went horribly wrong, and I'm very much considering moving out of the US after I'm done at school, perhaps take a couple of years in Iceland or the UK, find something to do up here... I seem to like it better here anyway, and I just can't stay under another Bush administration.  I'm ashamed enough over here to have to admit to my nationality.  Blah blah blah John Paul you hate America... nope, I just hate what the country has become, what it's come to stand for now.  I couldn't be more opposed to what the country is now, the ideals it claims to hold dear.  Getting an outside perspective, though, really does show what a mess the US is in; inside the country everyone is blinded by patriotism, but once you're over here you see how terrible the US economy is and just how insane everyone thinks the US is... plus I don't think anyone notices how divided the US is right now, and Bush won't help that at all; he seems hellbent on further driving a wedge between the people.  A house divided...

Iceland was practically one of the best weekends of my life, despite an inappropriate and irresponsible amount of drinking... but when the Poisonous Dogs are flowing, who am I to stop them?  Adam and Helga and I and Helga's friends who refused to speak English traversed about the Icelandic countryside, to giant melting glacier waterfalls to blue, milky hot springs.  It was surreal, otherworldly, and completely wonderful.  Helga is clever, and is now promoting Ninfant up there with a couple of other people, and hopefully Adam and I wil be able to return this summer CHEAPLY to play some shows and hang out for a couple of weeks or so.  Wouldn't mind expatriating to Iceland for a few years, even... now I just have to get the hang of the damn language.

Alright, I should wrap this up and get back to work."

"event","Well, yesterday was quite the bipolar whirlwind.  It began with Allison letting me know that I should stop and cease my ridiculous (non-)pursuit, and that she had been told that pretty explicitly.  Of course, I knew this would be the case, but it still served to completely deflate my resolve about everything, and I fell into a pretty deep nastiness.

So I wandered around Warwick castle with Allison talking out all of my qualms and problems and trying to make sense of my seemingly crumbling hope.  I tried to stay in good spirits, and I managed to be sort of OK.

After Warwick, we went to Kenilworth castle, where I along with some others, by climbing on the walls (an action we did not know was extremely illegal) got our group kicked out by some pissed-off ranger character.  

Get kicked out of a castle: check.

Fell asleep in my room, wallowing in my self-pity.  Ate dinner, and got somewhat buzzed off of the alcohol they served us, and wrote some pretty decent stuff on the ol' mandolin after that before progressing to our reading of Twelfth Night.  I read the part of Sir Andrew, which was great fun, and had more wine during the interval, managing to keep my character at a fair level of tipsyness.  I told [her] that I needed to talk to her at some point in an embarrassing and vulnerable manner, telling her she knew what I was talking out.

Several of us went to a bar after the reading, where we all sat and talked about religion and welfare and fun things like that.  We left bit by bit, and returned in the rain to the Quilt & Croissant, where [she] and I sat up in the hall, and I purged everything, told her everything I was thinking and feeling, in the hopes that that would clear my head and enable me to shift everything into platonic mode.  We talked for a while, moved on to other topics, and as I left I realized that my plan had pretty much worked... I was thinking of her much more in the sister-fashion than before, and I still am now.  I'm still quite full of affection for her, to be sure, but I wouldn't call it romantic affection now.

So THANK GOD.  Now my mind is at ease, and my ideal eventual partner has become alien for the first time in years.  It's kind of exciting, in a way.

In a way.

Today was pretty fantastic, as well... got a question-and-answer session with the phenomenal RSC actor Greg Hicks, who played Macbeth and Hamlet's Ghost, among other things.  We had all been hoping to talk to him, and we got to.  Fantastic.

This afternoon several of us went on a leisurely rowboat ride down the Avon river, after which I headed over here to the library, my final stop at the internet here.

Again, like the end of the tour, I feel like I've reached the end of another chapter, and now I shall move on into London with a different sense of security, and a different outlook on things."

"event","It's funny that I feel all bipolar now that I'm on medication that is used in some instances to treat bipolarity.  But I suppose that's the effect.

I've been thinking a lot of course over the past few weeks, not only about the obvious things concerning romance and the like, but about my convictions, my religious/spiritual ideas, and the like.  Not calling anything into question, but strengthening what I trust.  How fascinating the world is.

Nothing is clear anymore.  Yesterday was a down day, today's looking up.  I wish I could control my own feelings, but I still haven't developed that superpower.  I'm working on it.

Writer's block is muh'fuckin' over though.  Hell yes.  I just hope my memory's up to the task of remembering a shitload of songs."

"event","So yesterday hit a new low before it got better, just as soon as I finished yesterday's entry.  I decided to check on Leia via her journal, since I hadn't heard from her in a couple of days and was worried, and was treated to some of the most slanderous, offensive, hurtful, and infuriating things I've ever read.  This, needless to say, had me doing everything I could to fight back tears in the middle of the Stratford library, and was just blinded by how hurt, upset, and angry I was.  I don't know that I've ever felt that hurt by another person ever in my life, and man, that's just not much fun... so seeing the brilliant performance of Macbeth was halfway ruined because I couldn't focus on it.

Anyway, after the play, I just took a nihilistic walk around town, trying to settle myself down and ease my mind.  I felt more terrible than I've felt in a while, which was no fun...

Finally I went and ate dinner and felt a little better, then I went over to the other B&B to see if I could talk to [her] for a bit and just ease my mind some about everything, vent, etc.  So we ended up talking for quite a while, I felt much better, and then a bunch of us went dancing at this lame-ish club.  We didn't stay there for too long... I headed back to my room, sat up for a bit thinking and reading, listened to more XTC, and went to bed.

I'm really up and down in trying to figure out this situation right now.  Sometimes, like last night, I'm very, very convinced that what I want is in front of me and impossible (but maybe not TOTALLY impossible, if behavior is any indication), and sometimes I'm convinced that that's totally wrong.  I have so much going on in my head right now, and I think what I need more than anything is some comfort and assurance that eventually everything will work out everywhere.  My mind still settles and tells me to cry about Amanda on occasion, and I have to do that, to work through that.  I'm upset as I can be about Leia, on the many levels she's hurt me, and I wonder after what she's done now if we'll be able to regain some semblance of friendship.  I am willing to forgive, but it's going to take some apologizing.  I can't even express how that hurt me.

So now my hope is that there will be less confusion, and good things on the horizon.  For now, I'll just try to enjoy life to the fullest and not worry too much about things, even though my mind is a storm.

Man, what sort of insanity I live in."

"event","And so now, I wind up completely fucking miserable.

A series of minor upsets and small things happening to me have brought the full weight of all the recent unpleasantries upon my back, and now it's breaking underneath it all. Really, the most striking thing is that I now have nothing concrete to look forward to; it's all just fantasy and etherea. With Leia's recent infidelity, I don't have my post-Europe visit to Austin to look forward to, and all the magic it was supposed to bring. Returning to Furman has just become something overwhelmingly terrifying, and my kidding myself that some ideal girl will be waiting for me there does nothing to pacify me. My current romantic situation, if you could even call it that, is a total and complete joke. So now I feel overwhelmingly alone, dejected, and ready to slough off my naive love for humanity and my naive hope for something good that's always kept me going.

To a degree, I feel useless and unwanted in any real sense. I obviously wasn't enough to keep Leia faithful. I'm not enough to capture the interest of those I'm interested in. I feel like I've returned to my inhuman state as entertainment. Sure, people care about me as a human, but that's only the view through the side window that's sort of weird and kind of fascinating. No one wants to stay there and get lost in its intricacies.

Romeo and Juliet was a disappointment. It lacked the whirlwind passion between the lovers that should be there, and without that, it's just a disappointment. That play should have made me weep like a child last night, and I didn't even feel the slightest twinge of sadness as a result of the play. I'm ready for that whirlwind, I want it... I could have done with watching a fake one onstage last night.

6.0.

I just want to capture someone, and have that person capture me, and be totally and completely enraptured so that we become blind to the rest of the world. Until she betrays me.

Shit.

Yesterday I did laundry with [her] and read The Waste Land while I waited for my stuff to dry. After [she] left, I was alone in the room and struck by how much I simultaneously loved and hated the world. Then I wrote this.

__________________________________________________________________

They were all in reverse and cracks in the plaster opposite
Their children ticked by counting the seconds
Recounting with glee the trivial minutae
Which after years mildewed
""Stomach to stomach,"" she sang
And I watched
Turtles fell into a turbine and eggshells came out
Thrum thrum thrum thrum thrum

* * *

Around and around and around they went
Letting the robots breathe on their faces.
So she knitted a quilt from the clothes I loved her in
And my toes traced the braille on the sides of her feet
I touched her face and it wrinkled
So she washed the quilt and touched an iron to my kneecaps
And the windows fogged, enthralled
Thrum thrum thrum thrum thrum

* * *

Cold it bled in but we didn't move
We just asked the trees to control us
But they blew in protest by the fences
And our arms jerked like marionettes.
After they swallowed the sun, they buried her on the mountain
So all the animals could visit
But they fenced up the valley to keep me out
Thrum thrum thrum thrum thrum"

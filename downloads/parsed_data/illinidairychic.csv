"event","Alright I've gotten some lip lately about abandoning this journal so here goes.  I'm in the 4H house and this would be my second semester here.  I like the girls here and I'm having a blast being a 'sorority girl'.  If you've been sleeping under a rock lately and didn't hear I'm engaged to a wonderful man named Scott Roberts. We're getting a place next year and the rest will be history.  I have a heavy course load this semester so I won't be around much.  So to all of you that needed an update this is the just of it.

Lots of love to all of you
Sarah"

"event","It has been a week of concerts and horse shows... and there's still one day left!!!  I had a great time at the Brooks and Dunn concert Wednesday night.  Grant it I don't know which is which I still knew all the songs and had a blast.  Even my Grandma was getting into it.  I've got some good pics if anyone is interested.  

The Belgian hitch shows were amazing. I love how powerful they look pulling those huge carts around.  The had a group of spotted horses and a stage coach run around the arena which was just amazing.  And then when I didn't think it could get any better they brought out the Budweiser Clydales....I was in complete awe.  They are soo beautiful. 

Tonight I went to the Gary Allen concert and it was very entertaining as well...for those of you who haven't noticed I like country music. Well I need to talk to my wonderful boyfriend...I'll get back to you all later"

"event","Alright after being yelled at to update this I am finally working on it again.  I'm currently in Moline and will be here until the 20th of August. I will be moving in to the 4H house at the U of I this year and I can't wait.  I'm going in to this with a bring it on attitude. 

I'll be going to the Illinois State fair the weekend of the 13th. Scotty and I are camping and I can't wait.  He's never been and I hope he doesn't mind roughing it a bit...although we are going to stay at a KOA so it's not that rough.  Although there will be plenty of marshmallow roasts.  

In more recent news my concert got rained out tonight, so I'm a little on the moody side....I'll get over it though.  I have a weeks worth to go to so I can't complain.  So basically this week I'll be at the Mississippi Valley fair, letting my country side out.  

On dating, I'm still happily in love with my Scotty....I really think he's the one for me, we have soo much fun together and he's everything I could have ever dreamed of. I'm just glad I didn't listen to anyone who said he and I wouldn't work, cause clearly they don't know jack about relationships.  

Well as usual I love you all and I'll try to keep this more current"

"event","So today has been so eventful that I've just be inspired to write it all down...aka I'm having one of those days....

So this morning I started my day at 3:30 just like I do every morning I have to work.  I got dressed, nothing special just some khaki shorts and a pink tank top. Packed a granola bar for lunch and headed out. As I'm walking to my car a van drives up behind me and the guy leans out the passenger window and proceeds to cat call at me....scaring the ever living shit out of me. So I'm a little worked up and I quickly get in my car where it's 'safe'.  So I proceed on to Mattis, the street I drive most mornings to work, and surprisingly there are about two other cars on the road.  I think nothing of it and continue to head to work.  when I get to stop light it's me and one other guy driving a tanish newer looking car. I pull out ahead of him for a couple of blocks and then he floor it to get about half a block in front of me....thinking this is strange I don't speed up or provoke him.  I few blocks later he turns on his turn signal and puts his left arm out the window. At first I think the is just doing the signals with his arm and then I realize he wants me to follow him into some residential area, I'm thinking ohhh hell no and quickly drive off.

So that was before work...after work the real fun started. I got off work and decided to pick up some milk and diet coke before I made it home...I don't really mind smelling like cow manure when it's just Walmart. So I come home put the milk in the fridge realize I have no more room and figure I'll deal with it after I shower. So I shower, get dressed and begin to clean out my fridge...which I should do more often apparently.  So I finally make room for the diet coke and it's one of those fancy boxes that you can put in the fridge and open one end...well know me I'm accidentally ripped one side to far. But not to worry I got my stapler, ripped off the rest and began to staple...but the staple jammed. So I turn to fix the stapler and about this time 8 cans of diet coke decide to attack my fridge....so they were busting left and right and one even managed to break the shelf on the door...Now half covered in pop and realizing there goes my security deposit I get a bright idea......super glue!!! so I've just spent the last hour or so super gluing the shelf back together, which actually worked quite well, to the surprise of my mother. So now I will be picking glue off my hands for the rest of tonight.

Well it is definitely nap time...I don't want to touch anything for fear of having to break out the super glue again...

lots of love ya all...."

"event","Have you ever had one of those nights that you are soo tired that you want nothing more to just crash, but you can't because you have way too much on your mind??  Well tonight that's what's happening to me. I have tired everything to go to sleep, and I just can't. I think I just have an overwhelming amount of stuff to get done, and time seems to be running out. I have my first paper almost completed, and it has been great to get it out of the way.  But next week I have three exams, and I swear not enough time.

This weekend Scott is in Canada, and I miss him dearly. Grant it he's drinking and hanging out with his buddies, so I'm sure he's just fine...I still worry none the less. I swear that boy needs a cell phone or a calling card.

Well as for why it's bad that I'm up is I have the 4 am shift at the dairy in the morning, and I haven't really spoken to Allison for the past couple of weeks. I'm still confused as to why exactly things are the way they are, but I'm not going to worry about it. I just want to work, get paid and go home.

well I'm going to try to get myself tired...

lots of love you all"

"event","yeah yeah, I know it's been almost two weeks since I've updated this bad boy. Lets just say my life went for a roller coaster ride, and the good news is no one lost their lunch.

So last we left off I was in a pretty good mood because the night before I had drank some of my problems away.  It was a much needed break from the stresses of my current situations.

Well as the week went on Scott turned 25 making him officially 5 years older then me, which we have decided if you go back and check the age differences you come up with some messed up sinerios...for example when he was 18 and legal I was at the mere age of 13, or when he graduated I was only in the 7th grade....there's some food for thought.

Well for the rest of the week I had my sis and her friend here all week. It was soo nice to have company for a change...we had a blast and I'm sure they enjoyed spending their spring break parent free. So after a fun filled week with them it was my sis's bday...she's 16 now, I know it's scary...I feel kind of old.

Well for those of up to date, the tests were negative, so life is good....I can go on with a happy long life, and hopefully spend it with my wonderful bf scott. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

Well the last good news is it's our 1 month anniversary!!! I've been walking around with a huge smile on my face all day. I'm in love and life couldn't be better, I think I'm getting back to my good old self... and I have scott to thank me for that.  I just hope everyone else is as happy as I am...

lots of love ya all"

"event","Hey all....this week pretty much sucked ass. It kept getting worse and worse I swear. And just when I thought everything was going to be okay, bam the worst thing I'm ever told hits me like a ton of bricks.

Lost and confused and very lonely I got in my car. Stopped off to pay my rent and then fueled up. I was headed East last night and didn't know where I would stop. Perhaps my grandparents in Ohio, or maybe find my father...either way I wanted to get so lost that I could never find my way back. As I was nearing the Illinois state line I got a call...and I turned around.  Now it's not who I expected to be calling but it would do.  

Last night I finally threw caution into the wind and just thought of me for once...I haven't acted like that since about my freshman year of high school. I was laughing and life was good...although my ribs hurt so bad this morning when I woke up. and to think I got about 8 hours and I feel amazing. 

My mom is coming to town and I couldn't be more excited!! and then my sis and her friend are going to stay with me for a week. I'm just glad I won't be lonely, out here off campus in a little apartment can get very very lonely. And after that I get to go to Mo-Town for half of a weekend. I just hope this week goes a hell of a lot better then last week...

Well lots of love ya all"

"event","So my major goal in life was to never have to go back to another ER....in fact I had almost made it a whole year. But thanks to some costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage in the rib cage) I got to revisit past memories as I was standing for x-rays. A big thanks goes out to Shane for driving me to the hospital and saving me the 300 dollar cost of an ambulance, or even a cab.

For the next few days I'm taking it easy...the doctor said the pain should subside in about 3 to 6 weeks. I'm on some strong pain meds so it doesn't hurt nearly as much as it did last night...which I'm soo grateful for. I probably won't be on line as much or even at all seeing as how it hurts to sit up and type for long periods of time.

Lastly I just hope I didn't get Scott sick last time he was over here. I haven't talked to him since he went home...I know he was feeling pretty bad. Just hope I didn't give him anything bad.

Well lots of love ya all"

"event","My Horoscope for today:

You're the mysterious stranger. You're also everybody's friend, even if he or she never saw your face before today. You have the power to break hearts or remake lives. Even when you're just playing it by ear, you look as if you're following an intricate score. Start out on a long walk to nowhere, and soon you'll find a special destination. Your imagination is also your true vision. You surprise people by reflecting their own unique colors back at them. How do you do that, anyway? If you knew the answer, you'd be happy to explain.

Now on a new note I think I might be a bit on the crazy side...literally...I've been having the weirdest of dreams lately. They are very detailed...and this afternoon I dreamed I was talking to a pork chop...I dressed it up and made it dance and sing and everything. Maybe I should become a veggie, either that or I need to check to make sure no one laced my synthyroid with some weird drugs. I did wake up in a cold sweat and my heart was palpating...who knows??

I took a long walk through the rain...it was cold and dark and I would think I would be lonely, but I was surprisingly safe feeling. Although half way through it I realized I should have grabbed a coat and probably should have worn tennis shoes rather then flip flops...but hey I didn't mind my feet getting all squishy today...

Well I have to finish up some studying....don't want to fail my tests tomorrow.
Lots of love ya all"

"event","""true nobility lies in being superior to your former self"" a quote by Elijah Wood...I found this today and thought about how I hope it applies to me.  I see me now and I see what I was a year ago, even three months ago and I'm proud of what I've become. *huge smile*

Life is taking a break on messing with me and it's a well deserved breather...in fact I think I'm learning my place once and for all...last night a dear friend of mine was on the brink of giving up all hope, I never knew that just by telling them I care and not to feel lonely would help...I have a good heart and I'm glad it came in handy. Although I could not be there to hold him while he cried I know that my kind words did enough.

I finally got the free time to pick up a book last night, and I'm sure you will all here about it as I progress through it...I hope you like Toni Morrison because she is one of my favorite authors.

My cat has a new cute habit of making me roll out of bed, talk about your wake up calls...and then she looks quite satisfied that I'm up as she crawls on my stomach and gives me the feed me stare down...I love her to death, and I'm going to miss her next year.

Lastly I need a new pet name, Scott is having a hard time coming up with one...and the ones he's found make me cringe before they make me think awwww....so if you have any good ones let me know, preferably nice ones...that means you Sarah (I'm just your squishy)

Lots of love ya all, I need to get some stuff down around here"

Lately I've been questioning who I am, I know what I want to be and that is a good person, and although some of my past actions have not proven to be all that wonderful I know that I can be an amazing person....I just need people to give me a chance and try to not judge me.

I've also been fighting with something near and dear to my heart lately, and that is questioning if I will ever be able to have children of my own one day, I want a family more then anything in life, and if I can't have that I'm going to feel like I have a huge hole in my heart...I guess all I can do is hope and pray.

Lastly I thank God for sending me someone soo special, and I know that my heart skips a beat every time I see him, I know that I can get lost in his eyes for hours and that seeing him smile, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside...he's the best thing to happen to me in a very very long time, if ever....I don't want to ever lose him...and I hope he feels the same way

lots of love all"

"event","Well today the campus was a sea of green, Everyone showing off their want to be irish sides...lol (I know I was) And I was wearing the most obnoxious green shirt I have.

Well anyway on a good note, I'm very very happy with Scott, which is good because I think he and I are going to work out wonderfully...Although this week we are both very busy which might make it hard to see him. And then next week is break and just about everyone is headed home. 

I'll be here, but my lil neighbor is going to come down and visit me for a few days...She's 5 and is thrilled to death...I'm kind of eager to show her around and hang out with her...I know I'm a nerd for all that.

Well I've only got 3 more classes and 2 exams until break, that makes it sound soo much better then 2 and a 1/2 days, I soo need a break though I think I've kind of already put myself on one...which is bad.

And last but not least a note on the weather, who ever thought it would be funny to play a sick joke on the midwest is going to feel my wrath, It's not fair to tease with warm weather and then snow!!!

Well I need to get a quick nap in before meat carcass evaluations

lots of love all"

"event","Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me....just kidding, but really it is finally my birthday, and I'm no longer a teenager. I guess we all have to hit this age sooner or later. And I have to wish my Mommy a happy bday too, since we are both uber special.

I had a fabulous weekend...I got to go to a musical in Cedar Rapids Iowa. I love going to old theaters like that and just staring at the moldings on the walls and ceiling. I took tons of pics, I think I make an amazing tourist.

I finally got to see Alan after a long long time, and it was great catching up and hanging out...we soo have to make it more frequent. 

I successfully avoided Kellen all weekend, and I'm pretty sure that's a good thing...I'm 100% over it all, going home proved that to me.

I took pics all around town and had such a fun time...now when I get home sick I can open up my pics and be happy.

I have a fun filled day of classes, and I woke up bright and early this morning and dyed my hair....oh and I had it cut this weekend, I'm liking it a lot

well I'll talk to you all later, I need to get some work done
lots of love all"

"event","It's been a while since I've updated this so I should really get on it...I'll try to be more consistent in the future.

Oodles and oodles of stuff have happened.  But nothing too dramatic I hope...Well besides being in sort of a stand off with Allison, which I don't know how to feel about and it's going to take me a bit to figure out how to handle that little incident....but with time things will all work out.

I went to a pro chief rally out on the quad last night, which I was amazed how passionate people must be to go and stand in 8 degree weather to let their feelings be heard.  They get automatic kodos just for that....

I've talked with Shane and I think we are to a good understanding of why things were said or done they way they were....I never meant to lead him on and I know that it was hard for him to hear that I was always interested in Scott more. I think I'm becoming a bad person....

Then to top off my bad person status I kept Scott up until 5:30 am.  And I got a 20 dollar parking ticket for a no parking 2am to 6am zone, which I don't know who came up with those hours but come on!!!! I had a great time hanging out with him, it's nice to know that I have a personality of a guy from time to time. Not that it doesn't come in handy but I worry that I'm not girlish...I also worry that I've made him sick of me, which is a shame because all week I couldn't wait until dinner tonight, which I gave him the option of not going since he probably only got like 5  hours of sleep...I feel like I intruded on his space...so I've been walking around with a concern face all morning. I guess I'll find out later how bad the damage is....sigh, I'm trying soo hard

Well I should get dressed, I don't think the meat people want me showing up to class in a towel... although it might get some attention....lol

Well lots of love all"

"event","Well today was a decent day, didn't start out the warmest but it was nice by the end.  I had classes all day, being one of my busy days and all. 

I got a B+ on my Reproduction exam and I'm pretty proud of myself for that one. Also I predicted the closest on the pig carcasses when we had evaluated them live on Monday, and to think I got laughed at...that'll show em....lol

It's been brought to my attention that I'm pretty straight forward in my journal and not nearly cryptic enough, which is something I'll have to work on... but I figured this was a place for me to pretty much vent everything, and I'm not big on dancing around things...so we'll see how that all works out.

Since I'll be here for break I've been looking up things to keep me busy and I think I'm getting a pretty good list started...=P 

Today I went roller blading for about the second time in my entire life, and brilliant me decided that the 2 mile trail (the longest one there) looked the best...need less to say wasn't soo smart with 20 minutes until sundown, but I managed to make it, so kodos for me... I think I'm going to start doing more as the weather gets nicer...my goal for tomorrow is to walk home from class after 2:30...It'll give me plenty of time (it's a good 3 miles or soo off campus).

Well I need a shower, and possibly a quick nap....lots of love all"

"event","I've determined that life is finally looking up for me, I couldn't be happier... I realized that by being a new pledge member to the house I get to have a social life even in class.  I went to my statistics class with the crazy Russian and one of the girls from the house was in the class, so now I have someone to talk to.

I've decided I'm ready for spring, this cold weather isn't floating my boat... Not to mention it was actually snowing out last night. I broke out the flannels to sleep in. I even broke out and extra blanket, so I was nice and roasty toasty...

On a happier note, I think I'm pretty much head over heels for Scott...I think about him constantly and I can't stop smiling. Things are going soo well with us, and I know in my gut that this is the best for me.  I've never been soo overwhelmed by someone in a long time, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

I have a busy weekend so if I'm not on or around it's because I'm with my family... I'm pretty homesick so this will be good for me. Well I'm currently talking to the sweetest guy I know so I'll catch up with the rest of you laters"

We soo have to do that every day now, I was soo much more awake and I didn't yawn once...and it was on 2 hours of sleep, yeah top that...lol

So my mom was here for the weekend, and I got food!!!!! Yay no more living off of fruit and granola bars....lol,  I also got my car fixed, it was in need and now I feel better about driving it around.

The house was amazing, the girls are soo nice and I can't wait to live there next year, I'm soo excited!!!!!  I get to live there next year, I can't wait....and I'm still smiling, it's a very cute smile though, it's the I can't believe it I'm the luckiest girl alive this weekend smile.

And to top it off this weekend I get to hang out with Alan who is an amazing man, he's a meteorologist and I haven't seen him in person for over a year, I'm soo excited about catching up on everything...

Oh and I'm almost 20 I can't wait until my birthday now....You have no idea how happy I am, well maybe if you have been walking around with a goofy smile all weekend you would....

My life is looking up and I can't wait to see where it takes me....so feel free to call me I'll talk you ear off forever, don't worry...."

"event","Well it's a wonderful rainy day...I love to play in puddles and yes I realize I'm almost 20 but come on who doesn't like playing in puddles??  

Anyway I ran across some interesting people today, and I don't mean like wow that guy seems weird, they were full blown out there. First on the bus this morning I saw a pimp, yes I mean full blown pimp with the cane, hat and bling.  I was just a little taken back by it, I mean it is the first time I've seen a stereotypical one.  So then I continued on to my first lecture and the speaker actually tried to make us work, it didn't work out too well.  Then back onto the bus to get to Everitt for statistics I see my first Dike, I haven't run into any here on campus, at least not with the butch cut and all. So now that I'm intrigued with all I've seen today I think wow this can't get much better right...So I got to class and listen to the crazy Russian talk to us about the probability of this and that, nothing too exciting...and then back to the bus, the driver is like one of those people that you would call not all there, and I'm thinking great here goes nothing, she tends to mutter things to her self off and on and I just don't know what to think. Then I over hear the conversation being held by this older man and women sitting across from me....Apparently he is a writer an has just finished his novel and is telling her all about, which it didn't sound half bad...So today I managed to be more observant then I've been in a long time

An update on last night: yes I was up until 1 am this morning or so...I finally got up the nerves to tell scott I like him and it didn't actually blow up in my face so I've been in a pretty good mood since...Oh and Allison I'm sorry that I dove in head first again, but it's just who I am, and I can't change that. 

Well I'm off to clean up the apartment and maybe take a nap...

lots of love"

"event","Alright I've learned from talking to people that about half of them are crazy, yes clinically crazy...

I had an overall great day, I actually woke up for my review session this morning, and I'm hoping that it really paid off.  I did go to class in my pjs and remembered how great it feels to a bum once in a while. =P 

I haven't done much of the soul searching today, I've been stressed about this test that in the end wasn't too bad.

I've been fighting my decision to join a sorority with all my friends...It's not like I'm looking to change, just need a social life...I went from having tons of friends in high school to a small group that I'm not sure I can even call my friends, well not yet anyway....

I've decided it's official and I have a crush, no I don't think he knows so anyone that knows please don't comment on him by his name, I'm soo confused and soo lost right now, as Allison put it I need to test the water first before diving right in... this time I'm going to be in swim suit and all when the time is right...=P

Well if you don't know by now I have the 4 am shift at work...bright and early in the morning, well not really bright since the sun isn't up yet or anything...although we get some wonderful sun rises in the mornings...well I'll be hanging out on line for a bit and then off to bed for me

"event","After about a half an hour soaking in a bubble bath I realized I need to do some soul searching.  Not the meaning of life kind of stuff, but more of the who am I and where am I going in life?  I mean I've changed so much in the past year I don't really know who I am any more.

Last year I was Sarah Lynne Font, future wife to be of Kellen Biscontine McGinnis.  I had a set plan in life and that all went away.  I got sicker then I've ever been in my entire life, and I think I'm winning in the end.

So I've decided to generalize a lot about me.  First of I was born on March 15th 1984, and for those of you doing the math that makes me 20 in 13 days.  I was born into a middle to lower class income, and I've had to deal with that most of my life.  I grew up with my mother, little sister, and Theresa (basically a second mom)...my father is a lunatic and I haven't spoken to him for two years now.  Growing up I was basically a tom boy, seeing as how my first best friend when I was 4 was named Tony and we did everything together until he went to school. I had a rough time with my best friends stay alive, or staying in the quad cities.  when I was in 8th grade my two best friends and boyfriend at the time all moved away with in the same two week period... talk about feeling lonely.

In high school I was always the smart pretty chick that everyone knew of... don't get me wrong it was a great feeling, I miss high school greatly and it's only because I wish I had a second chance to go back and do it all again, to see what it would have been like if I had never met kellen. (if you're new to me you will find out he's the source of a lot of pain)  I've been working since I was 15 years old, I've always had amazing jobs, but not always so amazing bosses...

Looking to the future, I know this about me, I want to have a career so that I can support a family... I want to meet a guy that wants close to the same things in life.  I want three kids, and I would hope for them to all be boys but one girl wouldn't hurt.  I want to live somewhere that has the same climate as the midwest.  I want to live near some body of water ( I grew up with the Mississippi river two blocks away from my home) and I want space. I'm not a big fan of the suburbs and the entire group of friends I just made all come from the suburbs, but it's not me.  I'm a country girl, and by that I mean I like small town and dirt roads, I like being able to see the stars at night, and to catch fireflies across open fields...it's kind of like a dixie chick song, wide open spaces...that's what I need in life.  

So now where to start to get to that life, first off school...I have improved soo much this semester, and I've got a great mind set on how to get my life back on track.  Two increase my social life, which I'm trying to join a sorority so that won't be too hard. Next I want to change my image, I want to be datable or at least have guys that I like, like me back... which after talking with Allison today seems like it could be more of a battle then I intended, seeing as how a farm chick image isn't what I need to get the man of my dreams....*shrugs* eh... So now that I know what I want and who I am to start out with it sound be an up hill battle from here on out....I'm soo excited

well I've got a ton of studying to do but if I think of anything else I'll be sure to post it...

"event","I've decided that with how things are going I should just start venting on here, that way I can be real with everyone and if they don't like it they don't have to read my journal.  

First off I'm recently single and currently looking (in case you are a hot guy reading this) I've found someone but due to some things I think he might be out of my ball park.  Which is a real shame... but who knows life is unpredictable  

Also I have found the greatest group of friends to hang out with, I find them incredibly funny and it has been the greatest past month I can remember down here at college. Also just for bragging rights I own scott spiderman Robert's genitals...:P I hope they don't get sick of me any time soon because I don't think my life would be as interesting without them.

To my best friend in the world sarah, also my soul mate, keep your chin up girl.  Don't let past things drag you down and always remember I'm here for you.

I also have a physco kitten that you will hear about frequently, for insistence right now she just ran into the door, darted off and it didn't even phase her. And now she is attacking my book bag and lab notes....*shakes head* moving on... I live by myself this year in an apartment and this weekend I'm going to interview to live in a sorority...I really hope I get in, I mean come on pillow fights in underwear who wouldn't want to be involved in that....lol 

I think I found a new thinking place this weekend, and since it's a whole lot closer then Devil's Lake in Wisconsin it will be visited frequently... Shane, Andy and Christina enjoyed it this weekend... Although I didn't remember my camera so I have no pics, I'll be sure to get those next time I'm out there.  It's beautiful out there.

Lastly as to not bore you to death, seeing as how this is more of my benefit then anyone else's, If I seem sporadic I'm sorry...I usually have a lot on my mind, but from now on I'm working on speaking up, since no one can ever hear me and throwing my opinions out in the open more... wish me luck

well good night all and lots of love"

"event","Ladies... I've found a keeper. Finally after god knows how many disastrous dates and how many times I've been disappointed with men that just don't cut it; I finally found a keeper. He's smart, sweet, honest witty, a bit sarcastic, he's a gentleman, a little shy and def. cute and sexy. What else could a girl ask for?(Besides a few million dollars attached)Anyway... Last night Jason came down to spend the night with me because I was housesitting.. but anyway while we were in bed.... I dunno have you ever done something with somebody like.. kissed somebody and it just felt like the whole world stood still? and it was just like perfect? Thats what it felt like to be all cuddled up next to Jason; It just felt
perfect. And like to be honest I've never ever felt this way about a guy before!! And its been really exciting to have these intense emotions for somebody.. and to have somebody feel them for you too; Its so new and fresh but I wonder..is that love?                       

Websters Dictionary defines love as: A deep, tender, ineffable feeling of
affection and solicitude toward a person, such as that arising from kinship,recognition of attractive qualities, or a sense of underlying oneness.  

So how do we know when we really fall in love? DO we know within 10 years or 10 seconds? How do we know that its the real true love? with the word ""divorce"" floating around our society like cotten candy at a carnival does the word ""love"" still really mean anything? Whether its true love with Jason or not I'm not sure. I kind of want it to be.. but at the same time I'm so nervous for it to be. 

Existentialism On Prom Night:

when the sun came up 
we were sleeping in 
sunk inside our blankets 
sprawled across the bed 
and we were dreaming 

there are moments when i know it 
and the world revolves around us 
and we're keeping it 
keeping it all going 
this delicate balance 
vulnerable 
all knowing 


(sing like you think no one's listening) 
you would kill for this 
just a little bit 
just a little bit 
you would kill for this 

sing me something soft 
sad and delicate 
or loud and out of key 
sing me anything 
we're glad for what we've got 
done with what we've lost 
our whole lives laid out right in front of us 

sing me something soft 
sad and delicate 
or loud and out of key 
sing me anything"

"event","Well its 4:15 in the morning and surprisingly I'm still awake.. actually I haven't gone to bed before 1 AM all week and Jon is mostly to blame for that... but oh well I don't really mind. Tonight I had an amazing time.. even though I got to the club at 11:30 and they close at like 1:30 and I could have been there earlier and gotten in for free but nonetheless it was totally awesome. Jon always says ""I don't dance"" but when Electra was closing down and they played the last slow song he danced with me.. and I didn't even really have to convince him that much.. which is very very cool. AND GET THIS.. for a guy that doesnt dance he said ""next time we come to the club together I'll dance with you"" so my reply was ""the last song?"" (cuz its a slow one) and he said ""nope"" and my little eyes lit up like a pinball machine and so I asked him ""are you promising?"" and he handed me his pinky! way too cute! but now I'm sad because I wont be able to hang out with him for a few days cuz he has to work and hes going turkey hunting... so the next time i'll be able to hang out with him is most likely... sunday or monday. :-( no biggie.... at least its not like laura where she doesnt even get to see her bf everyday! :-( im lucky in that aspect... but anyway its now 4:30 in the morning and im beat cuz ive been dancing all nite so tata!"

"event","wow its been forever!!!! Hm... I think it will be easier if I cut this entry into sections cuz there so much to tell!!

Work: 
I became a waitress!! I moved up the food pyramid from being a busser! I still bus sometimes but thats not often. I remember the first table I waited on.. they were really nice thank god but I was literally shaking like a leaf. I remember they ordered two cokes and when I brought them their drinks my hands were shaking so bad that the whole tray was wobbling and I thought I was gonna spill their beverages all over them!! but anyway.. I love waiting tables cuz I make so much more money then bussing unless its a really slow night. but now with fall foliage coming up i'll be making so much money!! I'm scheduled to work for 6 days straight!! its all good tho... I quit my job at lou's cuz i was supposed to replace some lady only she never left so.. they can bite me for all I care. morons...I think that is what annoys me the most about people.. stupidity! 

Guys: 
well... there is this guy at work named Gerald. He's really cute and he's awesome I mean hes been skydiving and he has his pilots license so he said that he could take me up in a plane or something.. I mean hes nice and hes sweet and hes hott but... why is there always a but why cant i just be happy with that? but there is a but.. actually its multiple buts.. we work together for one.. and then we really.. idk i dont feel like I can be myself around him. like if you know me you know that I'm kinda crazy at times and I like to have fun and be stupid sometimes. I feel like I have to put on facade of being some sophisticated preppy girl who never has any crazy outbursts... idk i just dont feel really comfortable around him and finally hes leaving for pheonix in january to go be a cop. So... yea.. thats Gerald.
theres another guy Jermemy... hes a tool! to be honest. he isnt really smart.. i mean he thinks that NASA is a ploy made up by the government to make more money.. and that we never really went to the moon.. I was like.. oh wow.. your stupid. but anyway hes like infactuated with me.. its kinda scary. I was at work one night and I told him oh I'll prob get off around 4. I didnt get off till 8 and I check my messages.. he had called me 9 times and left me 6 voice mail messages. I was like.... OBSESSIVE FREAK!!! so I'm trying to stay away from this dude.. even though he feels the need to call me two to three times a day... thats Jeremy 
Now as for John... John also works with me at Firestones. Have you ever met somebody and thought of them as a cool person but not very attractive? But then as you get to know them.. they become attractive to you? Thats kinda what happened to me.. with John. When I first saw him I was like.. oh wow ""cugly"" but then i started to talk to him.. and get to know him and hes really sweet and.. idk hes cute to me now and lol.. idk yet so thats John. 
ok I dunno this guys name so bear with me..  so i went to Electra and there was the hottest hottest hottest guy there... like omg i was like hose me down and anyway my friend was talking to him. so i pulled her aside and i was like.. whos that? and she told me his name but i couldnt hear her. So I was like.. damn girl he's hot.. and she told him and he told her to tell me that he thought I was a hottie... so I walked over to him and i was like.. ""do you dance?"" and he's like ""not really"" and i was like ""cmon"" and I tilted my head alil and nodded for us to go out on the floor so he came out on the floor. He was so hot and he was such a good dancer.. and not to mention he called me a hottie.. *sigh* Then he asked me to back to his place with him.. but i was like.. i cant i gotta go to work in the morning and he was like oh i understand and then he kissed me and then we kept dancing.. and then he kissed me again.. god i could have kissed him all night long.. I could have taken him and eaten him like an ice cream cone on a hot sticky saturday afternoon.. wait did i just say that out loud??? anyway.. on the last song he kissed me again and he gave me a huge hug and was like... hope to see you around soon..i couldnt stop thinking about him all day yesterday...and today.. and thursday nite..i dont even know his name! mmmmmmm.... thats just gonna be his name for now.. mmmm!   


My accident: 
Right so I had just got my hair cut.. oh yea i got my hair cut! Its pretty short and I have bangs! its really cute and it makes me look oh so professional. but anyway I was in a hurry to get to work and I was playing with my hair and I was going across the quechee gorge bridge and this old women in front of me stopped suddenly to let a pedestrian pass on a crosswalk. and I was kind of tailgating I'll admit that but i mean.. she stopped like.. full fledge slammed on her brakes and I rammed her. nobody was hurt thank god just the cars where a little banged up.. my car beat the shit out of her car.. 0:-) thats my babi! anyway the women called the cops and they came and I managed to flirt my way out of a ticket thank god. At least the cop was cute so I didnt feel so bad! but anyway... yea im glad that I have insurance! 

Friends: 
I've been having so much fun hanging out with all my new friends... they are really awesome. I mean normally I wouldn't hang out with girls like these but they are actually cool. and im not just saying that because they buy me beer and alcohol.. they are awesome. And they really watch out for me.. i mean i was dancing with ""mmmm"" (from above) lol.. and we were gettin into it lol... but anyway we were dancing and she came over to me and was like ""hey are you ok? i noticed he was gettin a lil grabby"" and i said ""yea im fine.. i wanted him to do that... but thanx"" and later on the ride home she said ""i wasnt trying to be a parent figure i just didnt want you to be uncomfortable for any reason"" so she really looks out for me.  then my other friend took me to the fair in sunapee which was awesome I got to watch the demo derby and ive come to the conclusion that i wanna try driving a demo car.. and get this my friend Shae used to drive demo cars and she was like.. its so awesome! 

and Finally my last Catagory:
List of Things I wanna do before I die:
1. Skydive
2. skyboard
3. hanglide
4. ride a bull 
5. bungee jump 
6. drive a demo car
7. learn how to snowboard
8. go to a nudist beach

"event","well today started out normal except that i didn't have to work anywhere today! i was so happy.. I spent the whole day with alyssa. Anyway this morning I got a phone call from the guy at Lou's basically saying that I was hired. Believe me i was psyched.. I was like.. jumping up and down screaming for joy stoked. So then I decided ok time to quit Chili's so Alyssa came over to pick me up and we headed over to Chili's and I said.. ""I'm done"" and they said ""Ok"" and then Alyssa; the very nice chicka picked up my shifts.. and the people at Chili's didn't seem too impressed but hey I'm def. gonna make more moola at Lou's! so anyway then alyssa and I went and saw wedding crashers which was pretty funny... especially when this one dude said that he had crashed a funeral where the guy had died of a hangliding accident.. and then Alyssa and I looked at eachother and just started cracking up... like just laughing so hard and the people next to us.. i dont think knew what was going on.. but we couldn't stop laughing... good times! so after the movie I had a voice message on my cell so I played it and it was my dad and he said that he found me my car.. i was like... OMG OMG OMG! he said that it was a 1997 acura integra.. and i was like.. sooo happy and then.. alyssa and I did some shopping and then she gave me a driving lesson! rite so... that was interesting.. cuz its been awhile since i've driven a standard. And when I was going down her road there were some shirtless guys that we knew from school and we were gonna switch drivers but then we were like ""omg we know them.. keep driving!!"" so I kept going.. and then.. we were going back and we saw them again.. but we went right down the hill.. omg good times! then we stopped at the bottom of the hill to switch drivers right.. and so i looked behind the car and I saw headlights and i was like ""car coming.. .OMG theres a car coming!"" so we jumped into the car and then... we were all flustered and I couldn't get my seat belt to give me any belt cuz it was retarded and.. man good times.. def. made some memories tonight.. esp. those pix! ha..... ha.. the ice cream cake... and me trying to shove two cookies into my mouth.. and alyssa on the swing..and my good boob shot.. man..

"event","ok.. well alot of the guys at Firestones are kind of touchy, feely if you know what I mean.. like hugs and special handshakes and punching muscles etc. And I mean thats cool and stuff if they know their boundries. Take George for example; he's just this harmless, old dishwasher and he's just like a teddybear.. and I mean I can't understand him half the time when he talks.. he has a slur or a lisp or idk what it is but he's just like the sweetest guy you could ever ask for. But like.. we have this little inside joke about Dan (the other dishwasher) because he never works.. and I seriously hate when I have to work with him.. George works so much harder than Dan and like.. he helps the busser and servers he doesn't just throw a load of dishes into the washer and walk out back for a cigarette every 15 mins. But anyway.. back to my point. I was at work last nite and Larry one of the cooks I mean he's a cool guy and he's like wicked strong and jacked and he calls me ""Miss America"" and a bunch of other nicknames bu last night he kissed me on the cheek and he had like his hands around my neck and he gave me a hug afterword and it was awkward for me and I didn't really know what to do. But alot of other stuff has been happening with him and the waitresses... just lots of stuff. And then last night... because of an incident between Larry and Mel (one of my waitress friends) Larry might get fired... because of some stuff he said and suggestions he made... and I just like don't know what to do.. Larry always seemed really nice to me and he never bothered me or anything and he was always cracking jokes and making work fun.. for me anyway he was entertaining. but I guess he made it hell for all the servers. I've never seen Larry hug another girl or kiss her on the cheek like he did me...  So.. what should I do.. should I tell anybody about the kiss on the cheek? was it a sexual suggestion? was it harmless? If I tell anyone will it get him fired.. like the nail in his coffin?  
help me out people... post up comments for me!"

"event","ok.. today was my first day as hostess at both Chilis and Firestones and both were really stressful and I was really nervous. But.. everything came out ok... Chilis was easier I must admit only because everything was planned out and stuff and plus there were plenty of people around if I needed to ask a question. And Alyssa was working at Chili's so that made it 100x better!! At Firestones.. I dunno I just felt so nervous and just like helpless but hopefully I'll get the hang of it.. maybe I was too hard on Trishia? nawww... ha im so mean. But I'm sure everything will work out.. being a busser is so much less stressful though! I mean you don't have to worry about interacting with the customers or anything.. just find the dirty tables and clean them maybe say ""have a goodnite"" to the ppl leaving.. other than that.. nada.. zip. and you can make more money! thats the killer.. but of course it is more labor. OMG.. at Firestones I was supposed to bus tonight but instead I had to hostess and so.. my boss came over to me and he said ""Have you met Morgan?"" and I said ""no"" so then Dan (my boss) said ""well.. she's young.. and she's no you"" and after he said that i kinda stopped listening.. and i was like.. wow he thinks im a good busser.. or that morgan sux? hehe well whatever he likes me!! and.. he said that i looked really good when i got all dressed up for the hostess job... all the people did... even larry.. but hey larry hits on any woman that walks thru the front door.. but hey not every woman gets to hit his muscles.. cept for me! :-) alright I gotta go pack for my house sitting job.. ttyl!"

"event","well.. work has been interesting to say the least. I talked to Shay and come to find out.. Trishia didn't get fired she quit! She couldn't handle the pressure.. ha.. so I got her job.. im wicked psyched and I know its not a nice thing to say but she really wasn't right for the part. You see to be a hostess you have to actually be nice and friendly.. which she doesn't know anything about! So i got her job.. which is absolutely awesome. Plus I picked up a second job as a hostess at Chilis.... which should be cool. It's only a day job though because my main job will be Firestones and hopefully I can get piano students in the fall which will rake in more moolah! oh! guess what... I could be getting a car.. an audi which is pretty kick ass if you ask me. but it is kinda expensive $6,250 but i mean its a 1998, with leather interior, and power everything... sounds like a schweet deal to me.. so I'm gonna call about it tomorrow and go check it out hopefully this weekend! sooo psyched. well its pretty late and I have a long day tomorrow.. so goodnite"

"event","ok.. so today at work guess who worked today? your friend and mine.. the big headed, huge nosed, chubby Trishia. Right so she came in at 6:00 tonight and so it wasn't busy like at all there was a varied amount of different size tables. So this couple comes in and just asks for a table for two and she's like ok hold on. So it takes her 5 mins to walk around and find all the empty tables then she comes back after she has seen that there is an empty table made specifically for two.. bear that in mind. SHE SEATS THEM AT A FOURTOP!! OMG! what the hell was going thru her mind?? she didn't need to do that she wasted two seats and as it started to get busier we really could have used it because we ended up having to shift people around and squishing them in different spots all because she was too stupid to seat this couple in another spot... what it comes down to is she is stupid. I wonder if her looks... even though she is ugly with her spray painted face and designer clothes... I wonder if her looks will get her anywhere in life... because you know colleges look at your grades and how well you did in school.. not how good u are in the sack!! ha... even the girls at work hate her except of course for the other bitch Becca who is just as ugly as Trishia only older and more bitchy.. but oh well. I need to just move on... OMG GUESS WHAT! I talked to Dan tonight after Trishia did such an awful job hostessing and I was like.. Dan I'm looking for more time and I really would like to try hostessing and he was like.. ok we can try it. SO YAY!!!! I can wear nice clothes and stuff and I still can make lots of money cuz i'll still be bussing! so I'm really happy and on cloud nine and I'm going to bed!"

"event","ah work.. the place where you make money and make new friends and make new enemies. The place where memories will forever be made of infamous bloopers and heartwarming moments. Working with friends makes the time go by so much faster; its when people and old enemies that work at the same place as you that kills the affection you bear for your job. Such goes my story. My boss hired a new hostess and busser; so I figured ok... lets get to know them. Tonight was the new hostess first nite and come to find out its one of the popular bitchs from my school. I nearly died when I saw her... not only because she is mean and ugly but she took the job I desperately wanted; the killer is that my boss knew I was looking for a full time job. Plus I know the restuarant better then Trishia Fellows and I'm so much more friendly and outgoing and nicer and.... well you get the idea. So tomorrow I'm going to talk to Dan... ! It's not fair at all.. Trishia didn't even know how to answer the phone and.. she had like a 20 person line because she didn't know where to seat people.. and I'm like its not hard.. god I could do it. Maybe I'm being too mean on Pinocchio (trishia's nickname because her nose is so...prominent) because it was her first nite and all... but after all the heart ache and gossiping all of her friends and her put me and my friends thru in highschool... just once.. I'd like to kick her ass and get her fired.. 0:-) really I'm a nice kid. Oh I can't wait until tomorrow when I get to meet ""Liz"" whoever she is.. supposedly she applied with Trishia.. and god only knows. I can't wait to see the look on ""Liz"" 's face (if she is anything like trishia who is scared to touch other peoples food and ya know she has the perfectly manicured nails and such) she will not survive the bussing lifestyle. Sometimes I wanna slap these people. but really.. I'm a nice kid :-) gotta go to bed!"

"event","wow.. it's been a really long time since I've updated my journal. So I left off at Jordan's prom.. so after that I went to my cousin's wedding and she looked so beautiful and she looked really happy and I was really happy for her. Then I danced with this awesome guy dave and we got to chatting and we exchanged sn's which was cool and he might be coming up to visit some of his relatives in august! which would be sweet! cuz he's cool.. he reminds me of Jordan in a weird way.. only huskier. ok after Nikki's wedding.. my horse got trained!!! which was totally exciting and I even got to ride him and.. he's just so sweet and honest and totally reliable. Right so after Rocky's training came.. I dunno but some dude was riding his motorcycle and he broke down in front of my house.. and I had to give him a ride home because he couldn't get in touch with anybody from his family. So I drove him home.. which is in the middle of hickville.. ""uh yut"" was used quite often in our conversation during the drive. OMG HE SAID THAT THERE WASN'T A MACDONALDS FOR AN HOUR!!!! i nearly fainted.. I could never live that far out in the sticks. Ok so after that.. OH i forgot to mention that I got a job as a busser at Firestones!! which is the best cuz it's only 5 mins away from my house! and today I might have gotten another full time job at Lou's being a dishwasher cuz.. firestones is only part time so we'll see. Alyssa is a very cool chicka she got her license and she was carting my fat butt around today. OMG OMG OMG.. i got this waxing stuff at CVS right; so I heat up the wax and go into the bathroom and I follow the directions I washed my skin and I had it well dried I heat the wax just right and I applied a thin layer of wax to my skin I put one of those strips on the wax and smoothed it on and then *RIPPPPPP* it came off. To my  disappointment and dismay it not only hurt like a bitch but it only pulled off wax and my skin but oh no not the hair... just wax and skin!!!!!! Now I have skin thats all black and blue and looks oxygen deprived and it hurts like a bitch.. just ask alyssa or email me and I'll send you photos cuz I'll be damned I'm gonna get my money back! those nasty Sally Hanson people will be getting a letter with some disturbing images of my demented leg! Ok time for bed. nite"

"event","Right so last night was Jordan's prom. First off what kind of school has prom on a sunday night?? Honestly! Anyway he came and picked up at 3:00 so we could get back to his school in time for the bus. So we get to his school and we get out of the car and nobody says hello or anything.. that was awkward. So I figured ok once we get to the hotel and see some people we can start socializing.. wrong again. Jordan doesn't like anybody at his school and I can see why. They were all these clicky materialistic preps who were all about here and now. They were all a bunch of horn dogs and I didn't have any respect for anybody there except for one girl who was genuine and actually talked to me and I found out.. hehe I was evesdropping in the bathroom 0:-) and she's still a virgin and everything and I just had a lot of respect for her for not bowing down to the ""higher authority"" and succumbing to sensual pleasures. 
    I used to be jealous of all the popular girls because they had just about everything -- the nice car, the hot boyfriend, skinny and pretty and they always looked perfect even if they were having a bad day. But I've come to realize that popular girls are just sluts in disguise. They hide their true nature behind their designer clothes and expensive perfume. They are whores who give themselves up to any hot guy that comes knocking at their door and why? Because their self image is so low and poor that they think being with a hot guy will boost their ego. Too bad that doesn't work the girls just get a reputation for being a slut and ya know what? This is as good as it's going to get for these girls. After highschool god knows where they will end up; as jordan would say ""in some trailer with a guy named Bubba"". Now I realize that I'm a rare jem in a sea of sluts; I have self respect. A respectable girl is something that a good guy wants to bring home to his parents not some slut thats been sleeping around with guys and most likely has an STD. So I have the upper hand even though it may not seem like it now; I MAY NOT HAVE A HOT BOYFRIEND OR A CAR BUT I HAVE MY DIGNITY AND RESPECT AND THATS ALL THAT MATTERS!!!!"

The innocent can never last
wake me up when september ends


greenday rocked my socks!! The concert really was awesome.. the music anyway. Billy Joe was a little bit.. ""free"" with his actions aka he mastubated on stage! oh well.. it was kinda funny but kinky at the same time. Then OMG like OMG OMG OMG this bitchy lady took my camera! I know that we are not supposed to have cameras in the arena or whatever and I had completely forgotten that I had it in my purse and she was like ""do you have any camera's in your purse?"" and I said (absentmindedly of course) ""no"" and then she said ""yes you do"" so I was like ""OH yea!"" so I pulled it out and she snatched it like a fat kid would a cupcake. So then I asked her ""there are some really important photos on that camera I'll get it back at the end of the show right?"" and she said ""NO"" all snotty and stuck up like. Then I went and told Alyssa and then Alyssa's jaw dropped right to the floor and she stormed over to that bitchy lady and said ""look we have some really important pictures on here and we really need it back."" the lady pointed to some huge rubbermaid containers and said ""they all go in there once the show is over."" I looked over and could see my poor little Jeff Gordon disposable camera and all of our pix swimming in a sea of Kodak cameras. At this point I got overwhelmed and just wanted to haul off and back hand the ""frisk"" bitch but I kept my cool. At this point Alyssa was freaking out somewhat so we flew over to a guy with a wild beard named ""George"" and said ""Please sir help us that camera has so many important pictures and we really really need it back."" So George said he could do what he could. After the show Alyssa and I were walking with the mob towards the exit(and stepping on some guys shoelaces and trying to make him trip 0:-))when we saw George! We ran over to him and guess what.. he handed us our camera!!!! We were overjoyed!! and that is my story of the bitchy lady and our beloved camera. The End."

"event","omg.. im disgusted with the way people act. While walking back to my car after my darmouth course was over there was another girl walking in front of me. This girl was skinny and had the designer yet provocative clothes and she was very pretty; anyway this guy came walking up behind me and passed me to catch up with one of his friends. Now this man was in his early 50's. Suddenly this guy whistled at the girl walking and she glanced around but kept walking; the man let out another whistle and said ""mmm mmm would I like a piece of that"" the girl looked really anxious at this point and the guy couldn't keep his eyes off of her and she knew it..the girl started practically running to her class and finally the man turned off to go to his car. I was just disgusted with the way this pig they dare to call a man acted around the girl; sure he may have been doing it to impress one of his friends who was also in his 50's but the other man wasn't acting strange or perverted. I guess.. you can say that I've been desensitized towards this particular issue... I've finally come to see the truth for myself and I've seen an act of harassment happen right in front of me; the girl did nothing, the man's friend did nothing and worst of all.. I did nothing. What had happened if this was more than harassment? Some might say that this girl was calling attention to herself and that she was asking for it; I on the other hand beg to differ -- this wasn't right. The girl was scared.. and I've come to realize that crimes don't happen in just big cities they happen right here in our own backyard with the people that we know and have become familiar with. I'm shocked.. but I don't know why.. I always hear about this stuff on the news and the sad thing is that this kind of thing has become a daily occurance in todays society.. this whole situation has made me think about our culture and how demented it really is and that our values have gone to hell in a handbasket."

Do you ever feel out of place?

With the radio on turned up so loud
That no one hears you screaming

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like to be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked

To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more

Are you sick of everyone around?
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding

I think I have this disease call pissmeoffcitis; just cuz lately so many people have just been pissing me off.. and it doesn't feel good to get pissy at everybody around you. It's not their fault that I have pissmeoffcitis; but why are people so gosh darn stupid!? Right.. there is a ""method to my madness"" (oh totally ROT worthy.. ok maybe I didn't use it in the right context but.. oh well)The Dartmouth people piss me off to no end. They didn't bother to update their website of their class schedules so I walked for 15 mins. from the parking lot to my class. Then I go into the classroom and nobody is there.. so at this point im freaking out cuz I'm like.. ok I know im supposed to be here but nobody else is here so now im like.. ok i def. made a mistake. So I run out of the hall and down to the music department office where I ask the very nice lady where Music Theory is. She tells me that it is in a different hall and I'm like ok I'm only 5 mins. late so I run down to ""Lower buck"" and walk in.. and there are people there.. just no teacher. and I'm like.. SCORE i didn't miss anything. So I take a seat.. and there are def. all hott hott guys in this class except for one other girl who is like absorbed in reading so im like.. ha no competition there.. 0:-). anyway somebody gets the bright idea to go ask the music office where the teacher is so somebody runs off and does that and finds out that the class is in a different hall so we all pack up and move out like we are in the army; following the only guy that knows where the hall is. So we go into this nice comfy cottage and then we are ushered upstairs into this tiny room with a couch and a few folding chairs. It's really rather cramped and everybody can feel the heat as we are all in VERY close proximity :-D hehe. Anyway the teacher decided to do attendance.. so my name wasn't on the list. So now I'm like.. great.. just freakin great my name isn't on the list its hot in here and now I have to leave all these hot boys. So now.. I'm pissed I'm just about ripped so I trudge all the way back to the Music office and now I'm like.. ""RAWR!!"" and then the nice lady gave me my death sentance.. oh your class is a 2A.. which means you meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays.. and I'm like.. OH SHIT I MISSED THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS... so now im freaking out. Right so today I went to class and felt like a complete moron because: 
1. I hadn't read the chapter 
2. failed the quiz.. which was taken from the chapter we were supposed to have read 
3. didn't have a book.. didn't even kno I needed a book
 but... a very attractive guy sat next to me.. so def. perk.. oh ya def. perk.. but the little rascal copied some of my notes.. I was like.. :-O u little cheater! but its ok.. he kept lookin at me and smiling.. heheheheh.. *melts*. alright this is wicked long already so I better get going. tata!"

Today's run was different... definitely different. First off.. it was cold cuz of the snow last nite so I was out there in 40 degree weather in my little red shorts freezing my butt off all for the sake of exercise. grrrrr *shiver* Anyway I was out there running and I was going past this driveway when suddenly I heard this dog barking and I turn and looked and this huge black lab was running after me. I freaked out and started sprinting to try and get away from him.. but that only made the dog run faster so I just stopped running. The dog came running over to me and I closed my eyes expecting the dog to clamp down on my leg but instead he started licking me and running in circles around me then ran home. After that experience nothing unusual happened until I was up near Fredericks old farm. I was just going along minding my own business when suddenly this tan blazer comes whipping around the corner and they pass me and I expect to hear the murmor of the car as it drives faster and faster away from me ... but instead then they stop.. just randomly in the middle of the road. It is a relatively secluded road so nobody was coming behind them or from the other direction. Anyway.. it looked kind of sketchy so I kept running looking back every now and then to see if they were gone or not... they didn't move an inch. Anyway I went up to my turnaround and started back down towards Freddy's place and the car was still there!! now I was a little freaked out... there were some crazy and freaky thoughts going thru my head at this point.. So I did the only thing I could have.. I just kept running.. I looked at the car getting ready to sprint if need be.. as I approached the car getting ready to pass the back bumper... the car started up and started moving.. very slowly. I was suddenly relieved that this car had moved and all those bad thoughts disappeared. I stopped  running to see my doggy friend on the way back as he came running out barking at me. I finished my run with a dash home and feel invigorated.. yet disturbed with my encounters of todays jog."

"event","Tonight I feel alone; just utterly alone. I mean I've got friends to talk to and my mom and dad are hanging around.. but nonetheless I feel alone. It's like that alone kind of feeling as if your in a crowded room and your screaming at the top of your lungs and nobody looks around nobody notices you or the fact that your screaming; they just keep doing their own thing ... involved in their own busy agenda which is perfectly understandable -- life is busy. Once or twice I've been told that I have ""walls"" around me; I don't let people in because I'm scared of getting hurt -- so is it my fault that I'm alone? Am I bringing my own misery upon myself? Trust is an important characteristic that should be valued; not thrown about like yesterdays newspaper. Is it better to be alone and have your feelings left intact or be merry with many friends and have your feelings destroyed? I guess what I'm trying to say tonight is that before I go to bed I will be evaluating my life.. should you be looking at yours?"

They were acting immature, irresponisble and completely disregarded everybody's feelings except their own. During one of the scenes where this horrific little girl grabs the main characters arm all the girls behind us screamed; I wanted to turn around and smack each and everyone of them.... personally. I wanted to verbally beat their ass's and tell them how rude it was to talk during a movie...  then literally pound their ass's until they cried. I dunno I think I blew it out of proportion.. maybe it relates to me not being happy and I want everybody around me to be sad too. I don't think so; I was just pissed off that these immature self absorbed little pricks wouldn't shut their freakin holes during one goddam movie. anyway I've got to get going tata."

"event","Sometimes I wonder, are we ever really happy? Sure you may be rich, drive a fancy car, have a beautiful spouse or whatever else floats your boat; but really creates happiness? Love? Money? Material objects? I know that everybody has felt joy at least once in their life.. whether it came from winning the lottery and gaining an extra $100 or getting your first kiss.. joy is an expression just like anger and sadness. All of these expressions jumbled together make one big mess called life; everybodys life is different. Some people state ""oh you've got it easy"" but such isn't the case; everybodys life is difficult and hard in different ways. I just wish I could be happy; just for once... be happy for one whole day and not let anything happen throughout my day to wreck my joyfulness."

So reluctantly I went to the oil change place and as I suspected my hottie wasn't working only some old creepy dude who said ""what?!"" really loudly everytime I spoke. Then as if that wasn't bad enough I had to wait for an hour.. AN HOUR without any eye candy! Boy was I pissed.... then finally this other old dude comes out and says ""you got that there explorer?"" I nearly fell over laughing... but anyway I replied ""yea"" and walked out to pay the other guy. When I got home my Dad nearly freaked out when he got the bill and it came to $25 which it normally comes to $13... to my dads spaz attack I simply replied.. ""waited a week and I would have gotten it for you for free."" He gave me this blank stare.. and then walked off. As for me.. well I got into my sweatpants and got a pint of Ben and Jerrys ice cream and watched Silence of the Lambs.. wishing that I had somebody to hold me when they showed that freaky head in the cookie jar. :-("

My day was really long and just tiresome; and I've come to realize that I'm very clumsy and I'll forever be a klutz. Right so last night I was working out at the gym and I was moving from one workout machine to the next and I sliced the inside of my knee... only I didn't realize it until 20 mins later when I was on the treadmill running and I saw dried blood! Now.. I don't know if this happens to anybody else but when I see something it hurts more when I look at it. Immediately after I saw the blood dried up like a prune in the sun on my leg... my leg started to hurt!? is that possible? that was Example 1 of my clumsiness. Example 2: This morning I was coming back from feeding my horses and it was really slippery; so naturally I was taking it kinda slow and steady. Anyway I thought I had good footing on the ice so I kept walking trailing my little blue sled behind me. So I was two steps from the deck when my right foot slid out from under me and I lurched forward pushing my left leg... straight into the wooden deck. OMG that hurt!!! like hell!!! i still have the bruise... *shows off gross black and blue on leg* isn't it purty? wow I'm such a hick.. oh well ya all still love me right... right!? wow I'm tired.. toodles I'm out to dream of happy things!! i hope.... nite!"

So I was pulling out and this stupid woman never even bothered to look and see me so I had to jam on my brakes and let her go otherwise I would have hit her and she would have like.. sued me for hitting her car or something bad like that. Right so after that fiasco I decided to hit the feed store and pick up grain and 2 bales of shavings. Nothing abnormal there just some dude in his 30's hit on me!! EWW! ok so after the feed store I had to go to walmart. Rite so in Walmart.. I had to pick up a bushel for all my dirty clothes and stuff cuz my mom was getting sick of me not doing my own laundry and some pens. So I got my stuff and got out.. it wasn't complicated. Then the best part of my morning was going clothes shopping! I got these awesome new pjs that im wearing rite now :~)!! and some new shoes they are like sooo cute and my mom calls them ""barbie shoes"" but i think they are awesome! anyway  then I had to go get my dads oil changed. Now here is where my day gets really good! Right so the first thing I do is I park the truck too far away from the building so I look like an idiot walking in from like.. a mile away. OK i'm exaggerating... but I still felt like a moron that I didn't even know where the place was. Right so I went to open the door and it doesn't open so I pull it again.. then I notice a sign ""Door locked.. Please use other door"" with an arrow directing me to the other glass door. Now I'm feeling really stupid, I've just got this dumbfounded look on my face as I walk into the store and then... this hot guy caught my eye. and he was like ""heyy wats up?"" and i said ""Oh nothing really"" ""u?"" and he answered ""just working"".. *OBVIOUSLY!* so then he just kinda.. got me checked in and stuff and he smiled alot and I smiled alot and idk he was just so cute! so Anyway he said ""ok you can go have a seat in the waiting room"" and i was like... *drool* ""ok"". So I waited and waited and waited. Then.. within the span of 15 mins. 4 different guys came into the waiting area to either ask me which car was mine or get a soda or a candy bar or something.. I was like.. gentleman one at a time!! anyway I kept looking over at my hottie and smiling and he kept smiling bak.. but I couldn't tell if it was genuine or not.. it could just be his company smile that he uses for everybody I was hoping not but there always is that possibilty. So after an hour I got kinda restless because I had brought my hw with me and I had finished it already. So I started to fidget around and watch a little tv and watnot.. drool over my hottie etc. Anyway finally after an hour my hottie came out and said ""you've got the explorer right?"" and i was like.. ""uh... yea!"" really enthusiastic like.. i regretted it as soon as those words left my mouth I was like.. damn too much energy just be cool laid bak confident but noooo I had to go and screw things up by being uppity! But thats ok he didnt seem to mind. Anyway after another 15 mins. my hottie came out to get me and I was like.. ""ok"" and followed him like a little puppy dog to the desk. He said ""Ok your total comes to $3"" and I was like... ""$3???"" and he said ""Yea because of the long wait.."" I was like ""Sweet! thanx!"" and I think.. personally that they kept me there so long to admire me... hehe I hope anyway. Anyway then he was like ok ur truck should be out in a few mins. and then he was like.. ""so are u in school?"" and i said ""ya its my last year"" and he didnt say anything after that.. which makes me think he could possibly be too old for me. oh well won't know till i ask. Anyway I was waiting for the truck and then it pulled around and I gave him one last lustful look and smiled. As I was getting ready to walk out he said ""come again"" and I said ""I will next time I need an oil change"" we both laughed and I walked out the door. So next month when my dad needs an oil change.. I'm going to tire kingdom on a saturday afternoon at 11:00! *drool* ok I better get going I'm pooped!"

"event","Hey!! 
This is my new live journal!I'm so psyched wahoo!! I know I'm a little on the weird side, but hey who isn't? Anyway today in school I'm really glad that I studied ROT with Hailley this morning cuz that crazy bald guy we dare to call a teacher made us do 5 rounds of ROT! It's ok tho I got a 21/25 which is pretty good for not studying the night before. Then... OH MY GOD I wish I could kill the people at Dartmouth! Right so I'm trying to my dartmouth course set up so I talked to my guidance counselor got the number for the Music department. So I called the music people and they were like ""oh I dunno"" and I was like ""well can you find somebody who could help me?"" and they were like ""uhhh I guess so"" and i was like ""gee thanks"". So after getting patched thru about 5 different times I finally get this lady at the registars office and I go thru my whole spiel: ""Hi my name is Alison I'm a senior in highschool I'm interested in taking your music theory course could you help me out.."" etc. And so this lady says: ""You need to go thru your guidance counselor and he or she can you help you with the necessary paperwork""!!!! I wanted to die after about 20 mins worth of phone calls I wanted to scream ""NOOOOO!"" but I kept my cool and said ""Thanx"" and hung up rather abruptly. Oh well. Ok.. well I guess this isn't a very profound journal entry or anything -- I didn't find out anything new about myself I didn't discover any deep dark secrets but hey I have a whole lifetime to do that! wow.. I just fell off the sugar rush wagon gotta hit the sack!!"

Or at least partway to it.

My congratulations to Mike Melvill, who became our first civilian astronaut in a privately funded space shot.  I am so impressed with Burt Ruttan and Mike.  They are the hope of our future space programs.  For the cost of their vehicle NASA would have only been able to fund a PAPER study.  Damn, but that's efficient.

If you ask me, I think NASA should buy one of these vehicles, outfit it with a docking ring, figure out how to get either more thrust out of the engine, or build a bigger craft, and use THAT as a crew vehicle for the space station instead of monkeying around with the old, archaic, and quite fragile Space Shuttle.


In other news, got a job offer today from another recruiter for a position at Lens Crafters.  Hopefully in the next two days I will have an interview.  It is in Mason, near Cincinnati, but that's about as far away as the Lockheed job would be.  This job would be permanent position, with benefits, so it already has some plusses.  Here's hoping...


When I grow rich and mighty I want to buy my own SpaceShipOne.  :)"

"event","Had my interview with Lockheed Martin today.  Blah.  Interviews bore me lately.  Six copies of my resume' in front of six different people asking me if I have had experience with this and that.  When it is plainly indicated in some cases on the resume'. 

I see the need, though.  I've done my share of interviewing myself, and I know how important it is to review a candidate's background with the candidate.  Still, I wish I wasn't feeling so blase' about it.

I am told I'll have to wait up to a week to find out the results.  It'd be an interesting stint... plus, it is a BIG name to put on the resume'.  Furthermore, though, I'd have to get government clearance.  THAT'S a new one on me.

Gergis.  Joe Gergis.  I hold Secret clearance.  Muahahaha.  Yeah, like they'll tell me who really killed JFK. ;)"

a) busy.

b) Lost my job in April, still searching.  Go figure where my time is spent.

c) depression due to lack of $$$.

d) having too much fun playing Ace Combat 04.  Finally finished it.  Want Ace Combat 05 *drool*

e) busy.  Redid my backyard, pictures if I get some good sun to take them.

f) coding.  Must code... must code... must code... must code...

g) music.  Been writing more.  Happy about this, and desperately desiring piano lessons.

Anyway, blah.  That's my life for the last couple of months.  Not much going on.  Other than RSI due to my damned desk which I HATE.  Must get a new keyboard and finally eliminate the mouse.  Seriously liking the Touchpad LP.  I think the website is <a href=""http://www.fingerworks.com"">http://www.fingerworks.com</a>

As I have not seen him online, I can't tell him this directly, so here goes:

Wraith, I don't know whether to bless you or curse you.  Probably both.  You are directly responsible for my current addiction to Nightwish.  I'm in total lust with Tarja, the lead singer.  It's your fault.  Bless you... damn you.

Heh, that reminds me of a line from Enigma: ""I love you... I'll kill you.""

Thanks a lot, man.

By the way, they have a new CD out, called Once.  You NEED TO HEAR THE TRACK ""NEMO.""  And see the video.  Very trippy.  If my arm recovers soon, I'll go ahead and actually STOP being lazy, spend some time on my computer, and burn you some stuff.

I've been busy, and today we're close to finishing the second of the Two Towers.  Yes, it's the DVD Towers of DOOM.  72"" of aspen pine planed, sanded, stained, and otherwise bent to our will.  Much thanks to Swifty and Golden Dragon (my wife, Kat, for those who don't know) for their assistance.

We've almost got Tower B built; it requires more planing on one of the back boards.  Otherwise, it's nearly there.

When one has a prepaid cellular phone, one is continually challenged to by having to recharge it through the use of phone cards.

Though the phone cards may be readily available, the cash to buy them may not be.  For consider: if one had the necessary cash, one would likely have a NORMAL cellular phone with normally priced minutes, right?

At $0.50 per minute, that's 50 cents, four bits, two quarters, PER MINUTE, one tends to get extraordinarily miserly.

THEREFORE DO NOT SEND ME A FUCKING EMAIL ASKING YOU TO CALL ME, COSTING ME FOUR MINUTES ALONE JUST TRYING TO FUCKING CONNECT, AND THEN TURN AROUND AND WANT TO READ ME ANOTHER FUCKING EMAIL WE JUST GOT!!!!!


Do NOT send me a fucking email with incomplete information.  I don't mind talking on the phone - when I don't have to pay such exorbitant prices.

"event","From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this:  
 
 
 
What makes 100%?  
 
 
 
What does it mean to give MORE than 100%?  
 
 
 
Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%?  
 
 
 
We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%.  
 
 
 
How about achieving 103%?  
 
 
Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:  
 
 
If: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z is represented as:  
 
 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26  
 
 
Then:  
 
 
H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K  
 
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%  
 
 
and,  
 
 
 
K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E  
 
 
 
11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%  
 
 
But,  
 
 
A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E  
 
 
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%  
 
 
 
..And,  
 
 
 
B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T  
 
 
2 + 21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 105%  
 
 
 
AND, look how far ass kissing will take you:  
 
 
A-S-S--K-I-S-S-I-N-G  
 
 
1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118%  
 
 
So, one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that:  
 
While, hardword and knowledge will get you close, and, attitude will get you there,  
 
Bullshit and Ass kissing will put you over the top!"

"event","As part of my education at university we were required to take a full two semesters of physics.  A full two semesters of math, and that doesn't count against degree program requirements.  So I am well versed in physics, math, biology, earth science (yes, this is the penalty of switching majors after 2 years).

Now, in the realm of Science with a capital S, we depend on the Scientific Method.  This is the process by which we determine whether or not something is bullshit.  For example, Cold Fusion.  (The energy maker, not the software, though my conclusion is the same for both).  It is BULLSHIT because it is not repeatable, which is one facet of the Scientific Method.

Now, I maintain that for things to be scientifically proven, they must be repeatable so one can ""experiment"" upon them.

Computers are derived from materials science (from which we get Gallium Arsenide, Silicon, and a whole bunch of other neat, potentially toxic chemicals that make up those wonderful chips), physics (from which we figure out how to get an electron, which is so small you can't possibly imagine how it does what it does in a computer, to move from point a to point b using the laws of electromagnetism), and mathematics (from which we can actually mathematically state HOW electron X is getting from point A to point B).  Now, if you think that the Scientific Method is bad, try the Mathematical Proof (God-like authoritative voice mode).

Okay.  Under these rules, the computer should therefore be a deterministic (big word here, unless you want me to throw out finite automata at you) device.  It should be predictable.

I am therefore in a crisis of faith with my second religion, Science (my first being my faith to Almighty God, who defies any form of proof and deterministic law, other than God loves you and if you don't love God, frell you. :) ) since I cannot for the life of me explain the following.

I have a computer I built myself.  It uses Microsoft Windows XP, and I have a Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical and a Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro.  Don't argue with me that if I'm such a Microsoft hater why I'm using their products.  It's necessary in this case; I have no desire to get carpal tunnel.

Now.... I have had these things for a couple of years now.  NEVER, in all of that time, has the keyboard which has both a PS/2 (round) connector and a USB connector, EVER worked with both plugged in at the same time.  EVER.  I've reinstalled this keyboard at least one dozen times, and it has never ever worked.  Either the keyboard is active with no USB ports, meaning no mouse, or vice versa.  USB ports but no keyboard.

Today I had a crash error which necessitated, yet again, some driver reinstallation.  I cannot understand how my seemingly deterministic device, known as the evil bastard computer from Satan, therefore NOW decides that the keyboard can and should work with both the PS/2 and the USB connectors plugged in.  Mind you, this is actually the way they recommend you plug in the device.  It's how it is plugged in now.  It works.  I do not understand this at all.  Oh, and wonder of wonders, all those extra media buttons work too!  

HOW THE HELL DO YOU MARKET A PRODUCT WHOSE ACTIONS ARE NOT PRECISELY DETERMINISTIC?"

Take them outside to a large field.  Line them up.  SHOOT THEM ALL.

First of all, I do not identify with either one.  I decide on the issue, not the party nor the bent.  I belive we Americans should be free, that the government should not interefere too much with what I choose to do as a private citizen, but at the same time, there are so many sheeple here that the government does need some intervention.

But since when is the government responsible for raising my kid?  That's my own job, and if I'm not man (or woman) enough to do that job, I should be shot by my kid.  Not by the government.  Of course, then there's child abuse, which ABSOLUTELY MUST BE POLICED by the gov't.

See the problem is that the liberals, who ""espouse"" freedom, espouse it by imposition of government rules over anything.  Bit like BDSM, I suspect.  I have heard from another former friend that she was ""free and in control the most when she was totally submissive.""  Same with the story of O: who's the master?  How can you dominate a person who is so totally submissive that they will accede to your every demand?  Who's your Master now?  (Makes you wonder who's the top and who's the bottom, really, doesn't it?)

Whereas the conservatives seem to be the ""capitalist pigs"" that the Russians were so fond of calling us in the eighties.  Minimum rules and regs, let everyone step over everyone else.  If you're foolish enough not to see that this is a measure of societal control with minimum effort, poor you, you missed it.  Why should *I* spend *MY* money controlling you when you're so wrapped up in stepping on everyone around you in your quest to get to be me that you're doing a good enough job without my help?

Line 'em up, and shoot 'em.  Note that I haven't brought up Democrats and Republicans, because, during and post-Clinton, who knows what the fuck any of them believe anymore.  Oh, and since I haven't yet said it this post, fuck you. :)"

Personally I don't think God is even a physical being in the sense that we are, but God can certainly choose to manifest as such, even in either gender, I suspect.  Note to those trying to trap me: the virgin Mary is NOT part of God in the sense of multiple gods, so stop trying.  God is God.  Fuck you. :) )

Christ, as God's Earthly incarnation, would have us turn the other cheek.

The US of A, Inc., would have us turn the other's guy's nether cheek and proceed to fuck him or her up the ass repeatedly, in our quest to advance ourselves.

So what am I getting at?

We're human.  Therefore animals (yes, I believe in evolution).  Therefore instinctive, and nothing more than hairless apes with big sticks vying for power and more stuff.  It's always the same.  I want my better job (power) so I can get my new Cadillac (more stuff).  I'm subject to the same rules, mind you, since I've been on the receiving end of the stick lately.  I want more power and more stuff to make myself comfortable.  Am I selfish?  Yes, so fuck you. :)

Inherently we are selfish.  We're ANIMALS, for Og's sake (saw that somewhere else, thought it was funny).  And the quest is to become, what, selfless?  Well, if you follow any of the prophets, yes.  That's what we're supposed to do.  But I have to agree and disagree with Fal at the same time.  It took a tradgedy, a BIG tradgedy, for us to band together and do some amazing things.  3000 people died because of one loony.  One sheeple who rose to assume more power and reshape the world in HIS own image.  News flash: breaking into power over the sheeple that way no longer works.  Too many controls by those already in power prevent usurpers from doing the same old tricks anymore.  Doubt me?  WATCH HOW THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ AND ITS ECONOMY SHAPES ITSELF IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND TELL ME I'M WRONG.  If they do what I think they'll do, Iraq will become a society saddled with credit cards, technocrap (coming from me, a professed ""code artist"" this must seem like blasphemy.  Fuck you. :) ), mortgages, and a guarantee of peace because people are too worried about Getting More Stuff(tm).

Sorry, Fal, but I disagree.  Humans will not cooperate like that again unless there is a tragedy.  Star Trek is a fallacy.  Humans are too sheeply, too stupid, and too ... diverse to agree upon anything.  As my good friend and business partner Mike says frequently, ""Provided there are two humans left on the face of this earth, there will ALWAYS be conflict.""  Myself, I kinda think one human on this planet is capable of doing it all himself.  I, the last human on earth, having seen that there is not enough destruction and strife in this world, declare war on the duck-billed platypus.  Just because.

This sounds so negative, I know.... but remember that I'm speaking in psychohistorical (Asimov) terms, here.... groups of friends can be very selfless.  Witness my own friends: Swifty, Fal, etc...  But this CANNOT work on national scale.  They tried Marxism - it became Stalinism pretty quick, no?  You love Big Brother.  Your duty is to the state."

If you have politics - 

Please note that politics seems to be the completely owned domain of the sheeple.  Love to complain, don't vote.  Love to vote, don't complain.  Usually these are the predicted courses of action.  What most sheeple don't realize is that both of these actions are completely useless, <i>unless you happen to be the one in power.</i>  And a word to any of you who are contemplating this as a course of action: don't.  You don't deserve it.  Anyone who seeks power should not wield it.  Actually, anyone who seeks power should likely be shot, because I can guarantee there's an agenda behind it.  Goes into that human nature thing, which I mentioned earlier.  Future post on selflessness versus selfishness will explain this more.

Anyway, politics is a good distraction from the real problems people face.  I've said this before: there will NEVER be another civil war in this country for one simple reason.  Are you really going to take up arms and fight when you're worried about the car payment, insurance payment, mortgage payment, and that new Plamsa HD TV you want?  No, you're going to sit in your living room and bitch at the evening news when a new tax cut comes down, or some silly law gets passed.

Have a nice cup of shut the fuck up. :)

If you have religion - 

Let me first qualify that I have studied most major religions, and some esoteric ones: Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism (little fuzzy on this one), Hinduism, Tarot magick, faery magick, Enochian magick, paganism, Wicca, and some others I do not recall.

Let me further qualify that when I say religion I do NOT mean faith.  Faith is a belief.  Religion is a system.  Faith, to me, is a deeply personal thing and if you want to discuss that with me, that's fine.  Respect mine and I'll respect yours, but don't try to convert me.  I am a Christian, by faith, though the values and beliefs I espouse are a bit more esoteric than most RELIGION would allow for.  That said, fuck you.  (Saying that quite a bit, aren't I? :) )

Religion is not faith.  Religion uses faith, but if you doubt that in fact it is yet another system, go look at the Catholic Church scandal and tell me how, in any way what some of these priests have done, or protected, does NOT violate most faith systems (teachings of Christ, Mohammed, Wicca Law of Three, Egyptian Judgement by Anubis, etc).  So if it is violating faith, what is it?  It's a measure of sheeple control.  Do what the church/synagogue/mosque/sacred coven tells you, and you'll be ok.  If you're ok, you're ""accepted.""  Okay, so this says to me that you are weak and require the acceptance of others to percieve yourself as worth, right?

Big reference here to Wraith's rant about his mother, and the Chinese honor thing.  It's more philosophy in his case, as is most Chinese tradition, but it doesn't much vary from what I'm speaking of here.  Same with Foxiecrumz comment about covens."

Plain and simple.

I've been heard saying that ""I can't catch a break"" lately.  Which is very true.  The problem is that that statement is clearly in conflict with who I am, which is an Aries.  We don't ""catch"" breaks, we make em.  *gangster voice* Or we break you. *evil grin*

Still, I have noted that while I don't believe in luck, being too much of a ""code artist"" who understands the computer intimately, the truth is that life will NOT favor you unless you take active steps.  For example: Fal quotes himself as being VERY lucky.  I suppose this is why he's in an air cast.  He's paying for that luck now, isn't he?  I don't mean to be sarcastic or mean, but this is my observation.  Yin and yang.

End result: shut the fuck up and do something about it if you don't like it.  Or, to quote Arnold Judas Rimmer (Red Dwarf): ""STOP YOUR FOUL WHINING, YOU FILTHY PIECE OF DISTENDED RECTUM!""

Seriously, there's a time to bitch and a time to stop bitching.  And far too many people, sheeple especially, seriously love it.  Then again, a good number of 1%ers lament their situation, which makes me wonder if they are any better.  Sometimes all you need is five minutes and a baseball bat.  Go find a bat. :)"

"event","So there's been the use of the word sheeple by folk who have met me briefly.  I have been praised as a ""good friend"" and an ""intelligent thinker.""  While I sometimes debate my intelligence, I do appreciate the compliments.  So here, for the nth time, is my theory.

A long while ago a former friend of mine, Dan,  came up with the prototype 90% rule, which, when I altered, goes like this:

90% of the world's population are assholes.
9% are tolerable, but you keep them at arm's length.
Only 1% are deserving enough to be called ""friend.""  If you find a 1%er, KEEP THEM.

The modification thusly reads:

90% of the world's population are sheeple.
9% are capable of sporadic independent thought, and are thus tolerable.
Only 1% are actually thinkers, and thus deserving enough to be called ""friend.""  If you find a 1%er, KEEP THEM.

Several points of note, to be expounded upon in later journals:

First, I do not always think of myself as a 1%, even if I did come up with the rule.  Sometimes I conform.  Sometimes I am an asshole.  My job is to minimize this time.

Second, I have noted that the 1% population might be wrong.  Another former friend, Jen, did mention once that I was being lenient.  By the way, she's a 9% person by my book, which is why we don't speak.

Third, the 1% nearly always are creative types.  I have very, VERY few intelligent friends who are not creative, either on paper, in music, or in some other form.  They tend to be a bit... off.  This would seem to suggest that my definitions are off, that in fact I am an outcast who is crying over the fact that I'm not popular.  If you are one of those who thinks so, fuck you.  I'm happy with what and who I am, despite my current circumstances.  YOU are likely not.  See future rant.

Fourth, and this is the really important bit, sheeple tend to be the popular ones, or the studious ones, or ... or any number of sterotypes.  For those who want to eliminate stereotypes, fuck you.  You can't.  Society created them, and society WANTS them.  Which is to say that sheeple want them.  Don't disturb their fragile sense of equilibrium given to them by imperfect words.  Religion (another future rant) is in a similar state here."

"event","The result of the storm seems to have been as follows:

Drain old UPS, requiring purchase of another.

Wig out after new UPS is inserted into USB port, thereby causing motherboard to possibly die, freak out several times, and finally disavow any knowledge of anything known as USB.

Force a complete repair installation of XP, which required the creation of a specialized CD so as to ""slipstream"" service pack 1 into the installation.  Which required using other arcane programs to strip off the boot block from the original XP CD.  Oh, not to mention, ripping apart two computers since the one trying the rescue had no burner.  Which required installation of burner software.  

In the middle of all this, the net connection was down.  Hence, this mostly was done blind.

Nevertheless, it is done, and my computer, Enterprise, is back to normal, sans custom login screen and some TweakXP settings.

We shall see.  Need to find a system optimizer now to see what should be done."

"event","So I'm on the computer yesterday afternoon.... BEAUTIFUL day, no clouds... this is about 3PM.

Within an hour, dark, BLACK clouds roll in, and a thunderstorm starts.  And a bolt of lightning hit a pole about 200 feet from my window.  Stupid me, I was looking in that direction at the time.  Couldn't see straight for about five minutes.

The day hadn't been going well, but the fact that I was shutting down since we were now on battery backup was not helping.  Granted, I am very happy that my system is on an APC, and was pleased that it had kicked in, but I wasn't thrilled about being forced from the computer.

Needless to say, the power came on about 1/2 an hour later, but only partially; the kitchen was pretty dead.  Which meant, of course, that I wasn't about to be foolish enough to power up.

Not that it had mattered of course.  By the time it was over, something like seven police cruisers, two fire trucks, and a LIPA vehicle had been dispatched.  The LIPA vehicle spent the next four hours visiting various poles.  Along this, dinner had to be completely barbecued, since there was no power to the kitchen.  So this caused Mom and Ed to react badly to the potatoes (which they said were not well done, but I disagreed), the steak was burnt, the chicken was crisped, and Mom managed to slice her thumb open.  When the power finally came back on at about 10:30PM (after a blackout casued by LIPA in the middle of ""Minority Report"" which I had predicted) I discovered that my trusty BackUPS 280VA had died.  Leaving it all night plugged in did nothing for it.  I'm not convinced it is yet dead, but it does need some form of service.  We shall see.

Staples had a BackUPS ES 500VA, which is now installed and monitoring.  Only, why is my house power now at 131 volts instead of 120?"

"event","I am slowly but surely learning an interesting lesson.

The number of people willing to freely give, without question or comment, is next to zero.

I'm being bitched at constantly by my father-in-law.  GR!

Why?  Because we've been here three months trying to get this game out, and I'm invading his private space.  Mind you, I try as much as possible to be as unobtrusive as possible.  I am going out of my mind because essentially, I exist in one of two small rooms.  I don't go out much.  I don't talk to people much.  I don't do much of anything anymore, and I'm very stressed out.  Pile that on top of the stress of having little, if no funds, trying to launch my business, and trying to launch my game.

No, that's not enough.

So I still believe in the 90/9/1 rule.  90% of the worlds people should just cease to be.  9% are tolerable in small amounts, whereas 1% of the world's population, perhaps less, are the true givers and lovers, and peacemakers of the world.

And I'm not a mooch, either.  I'm just down on my luck right now.... and I don't want to be in this position anymore."

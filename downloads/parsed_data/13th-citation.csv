My whole summer was wasted there, damnit. School starts on Monday. One hell to another. 

Pfft. I'm going to Tami-chan's and I'm staying there for a while. So I can get out of this fucking house. I don't even think my damn mother has noticed me home. Keh. I don't fucking care anymore."

School should go to hell or whatever. I'm really close to bombing the fucking thing. People there suck. I hate them. They hate me. A hate-hate relationship. Fft. Like I fucking care what the world thinks about my ""damn-right disfunctional"" personality.

Feh. I need to buy a new keyboard. The one right now is TOO FUCKING LOUD while I type. Damn thing. 

I think I almost caused Tami-chan to die of shock or something. I said the word 'darn' in place of 'damn'. She was like, ""OMG! You didn't cuss!!"". Yeah, whatever. Pft.

My mom came back home yesterday. Oh <b>my</b> god, her life was terrible. Fucking boo-hoo to her. She stopped paying an ounce of attention tome about a year and a half ago. 

And I'm the one who needs fucking help? Pfft. She more screwed over now than I am. She dug herself one hell of a deep grave. I should laugh."

And don't one of you damn peoples day ""love"" and all that shit. I don't fucking care. 

I cut my hair. I took off 6 or more inches. Fucking hair dresser bitched about her love life the whole time. Anyway, my hair is now 2 inches below my shoulder.

When I said before that my hair was below my shoulders, I meant past my waist.

The moral of this fucking entry? It gets me off the hook about updating for another fucking week and it tell you people that my life is still a piece of shit.

Hope you have a fucking wonderful day! Fft."

You are now referred to as The Kid. -^.^-"

"event","Um, well hello. This isn't Citation-chan, as I suppose everybody knows her here. This is Tami-chan; I'm sure this is how she refers to me. My real name in Lynn, but she has always called me ""Tami"" for some unknown reason. -^.^-

Anyways, she wrote a note to me and told me to update this for her. She is currently being counsled. I suppose you'd like to know why.

Let me just say that some senior in school ticked her off. He now has a black eye, a broken nose, and probably numerous other bruises. Aya-chan (Citation) has been suspended, but no worries, she'll be back tomorrow after her mom lodges a complaint.

I guess your wondering why she can come back too. Well, this is what she told me to write. It's her exact wording. 

*********

Ch. Hope your ready to hear my story. If not, too bad, frankly I really don't care.

It doesn't really matter where or when I was born; I see no reason for this to affect the present, unless you want to know my age. I'm 17. Whatever. I have black hair streaked bloody red; it covers one eye and goes down well below my shoulders. And I'm a wiccan/pagan.

Anyway, this is my first year back in damn public school. When I was 5, my dad shot himself and when I was 10 I was sent to an ""insane clinic"". They told me I had multiple personality disorder and started giving me ""anger managment"" Pfft. I'll just tell you that my school has permission to legally administer me a tranquilizer.

Heh. Serves this fucking world right.

I met Tami-chan there. She was in for schizophrenia. We became friends. She was just one of those types of people you couldn't believe had a ""problem"". Light brown hair cut just below her ears, green eyes, and a disposition to match her calm looks. She's also 17 now. When she was 14 they released her, dubbing that her schizophrenia was now harmless.

Fucking hell. They don't know a damn shit about her. Harmless my ass. Pfft.

I don't know, she's always been there for me and is probably the only living creature I can stand without wringing their damn neck.

I was released just last summer, and lucky me, was enrolled in high school. The only good point was that it just happened to be the one Tami-chan goes to.

This Year:

She made me get this stupid journal.
Saved 2 kids from me (out of 9).
Whooped my ass at any fighting game.
Hid me from the cops.
Tried to get me to eat hot sauce and chocolate pudding.
Talked the school out of giving me a tranquilizer.
Found me a job I could stand.
Showed me manga/anime.
Stabbed me with an umbrella.
Drug me into cosplaying with her.
Rode in a limo with me.
Sneaked into a concert with me.
Pfft, and more damn stupid stuff.

I don't like people, don't piss me off. I don't give a damn what you think. 

***********

There was going to be more, but she said she didn't feel like writing anymore ""shit"" (in her words). Just think of it as a summary. -^.^- And no, I don't mind how she it. It <i>is</i> her, my best and only friend, and I wouldn't want her acting any other way.

Well, my job is done. Toodles, as they say in some foreign country, toodles I say!"

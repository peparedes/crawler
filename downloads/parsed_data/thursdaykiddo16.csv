"event","Thank god for amber. i guess i better put a comment on everyone's thingy, because she got my email address back. randy, fuck you. you don't know what goes on with other people's relationships. mandy and I were best friends until your drama shit seperated us. supposedly we're not fighting... but we have not talked. Still think of meghan and Candice, because Candice told meghan, ok i forgive you, but I'm still not going to be your friend. Think about it... mandy and me talked like we were ""ok"" but she still doesnt act like she is my friend at all. Damn am I in a fucked up prophecy???"

"event","the thing with meghan and candice... it has turned into a Me-And-Mandy reality. it is a living hell having your best friend not acknowlede you. i suppose it is my fault. but i guess the only real question is who is meghan and who is candice. in a way we are both. i'm meghan when i can't forget about all the fun times we've had, and yet she seems to throw it all away like nothing. but I guess I'm like Candice because i was the bitch. maybe mroe like meghan though, because all she seems to call me is a naive child. I got that from her, I got it from samantha. naive. I guess that's who I am now."

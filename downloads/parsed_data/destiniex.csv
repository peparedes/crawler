"event","you know when your playing a game...maybe for example tetris on our cellular device and your already doing a bad job so you just end it and start over? i really wish i could end all this and start over. i'm sick of people asking me why i have a chip on my shoulder. try going through what i've been through and not have a chip on your freaking shoulder. and i do not need nor want sympathy. i just want everyone to allow me to be pissed off. can't i just be pissed off?!?"

"event","i really effed up this time. i feel like crap. i dont want to be here anymore. and when i sit and think about how its <i>all my fault</i> that i'm here it only makes thing worse. i want to be home. where i belong. i hate my dads. i don't feel comfortable here. i dont feel loved here. i thought it wouldn't bother me but GUESS WHAT?!? i guess i'm just a little bitch who can't suck shit up. 'cause all i want to do it cry right now. i want to go home <b>tonight</b> i miss my sisters. and my bed, and my closet and half my clothes and my <u>shoes</u>. i dont even know where to end with that list. i guess mistakes are supose to make us stronger."

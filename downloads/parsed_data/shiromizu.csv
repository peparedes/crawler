"event","Rush jobs, poor sleeping habits, World of Warcraft and the web has really cramped my sleeping pattern. I can't sleep a wink at night and can't stay awake in the morning. This past week, I've been working at night and sleeping in the day. I've had no success today, either, so I said <span style=""font-style: italic;"">""screw it, I'm gonna do something about it!""</span><br style=""font-style: italic;""><br>Okay, I didn't really say that. I just ran a Google search and came across <a href=""http://parentingsquad.com/easy-way-to-reset-your-sleep-cycle-stop-eating"">this link</a>. To quote:<br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">""Simply stop eating during the 12-16 hour period before you want to be awake. Once you start eating again, your internal clock will be reset as though it is the start of a new day.&nbsp; Your body will consider the time you break your fast as your new ""morning."" </span><p style=""font-style: italic;"">For example, if you want to start waking up at 2:00 am, you should start fasting between 10:00 am or 2:00 pm the previous day, and don't break your fast until you wake up at 2:00 am. Make sure you eat a nice healthy meal to jumpstart your system.""</p><p>Sounds plausible. I stopped eating at about 10:00PM last night so if I manage to fast up to 8:00AM, I can see for myself if it actually works. Healthy eating and regular exercise is in check - all I need is a good night's sleep. I'll keep my fingers and pillows crossed.<br></p><p>Oh, and if it doesn't work, remind me that I owe myself a Quarter Pounder.

"event","<p>Let's face it. No matter how much we try to deny it, we can be really geeky sometimes. Hobbies, preferences, entertainment - a lot of them are made up of what could be called ""geeky"" in society. This translates into our everyday activities and somehow develops a mindset for things we normally do.   <br />One particular facet of the geek culture can be attributed to our daily chores. Role-Playing Games or RPGs have been the butt of many geek jokes for a while now, but you can learn a lot from these games if you look hard enough, brave traveler.    <br />Patterning your mindset in life through RPG systems can actually help if you're finding yourself unmotivated or forgetful of menial tasks. Try making a system for yourself and see it might help you.</p>  <p>Here are just some stuff I've got from the top of my head. Feel free to contribute.</p>  <p><b>How it can help your career:</b></p>  <ul>   <li>New at your job? Everyone starts at Job Level 1. Grind well and look forward to the next promotion! You'll love your new skills and get phat lewt.</li>    <li>Got a tough project? Enlist the aid of your party members (your co-workers). Going solo? Hunker down and use your best skills. Brainstorm Level 10, Diligence Up, and Creativity Juice works wonders against the Deadline Boss Monster. Do your best and you might get that rare Promotion drop.</li>    <li>Applying for a job? Make sure you have the right skill set for it. Do your research, maximize your stats, and don't be late for your interview. Once you get the job, you'll be earning your own gold and finally stop leeching from your parents.</li>     </ul>  <p><b>Staying fit:</b></p>  <ul>   <li>Want to look better? Hit the gym or just run a few blocks around your neighborhood. Doing so will raise your VIT, AGI, DEX, CON, and more. Those hot Elf chicks and Warrior studs will want you in their party.</li>    <li>Remember what they say about drinking at least 8 glasses of water a day? It really helps, specially if you're trying to lose weight or dehydrated in the humid Philippine Dungeon. I have trouble remembering that I need to take in fluids, specially when I'm busy. What I do is envision an EXP bar. Every time I drink a glass of water, the bar fills up. At 8 glasses, my hydration level goes up.</li> </ul>  <p><b>Life in General:</b></p>  <ul>   <li>Trouble saving money? Just recall those days when you scrounged up every gil/gold/zeny/etc. to buy that awesome sword you saw at the Weapon Merchant's store. More funds give you more opportunities to level up in life.</li>    <li>Growing old? Your age is your Base Level. You get bragging rights for reaching higher levels than those newbies in the 10+ levels. Plus you get more gold than they do. Ha!</li>    <li>Afraid of investing in something? Those who are afraid of upgrading their armors past +9 will never get +10. Some gambles can cost you and some will pay off. Just be sure to learn the pros and cons and you'll make an informed choice every time.</li>    <li>Dentist fear? Even the toughest warriors need to get their health replenished and equipment repaired. Be true to your teeth now or they will become false in the future.</li>    <li>Lazy? Nobody gained a level sitting in town, begging for zeny.

"event","<p>Ah, siblings. What would we be without them? An only child, I presume. I have two brothers, <em>Kuya </em>being the eldest and a <em>Bunso.</em> That makes me the middle child in a very common three-son setting. That being said, it wouldn't be a normal brotherhood without squabbles, rowdy play and other shenanigans. Us brothers are particularly into gaming and have developed different preferences. I personally liked action, FPS and RPG genres and the youngest also follows a similar interest along with sports games. <em>Kuya,</em> on the other hand, has an unhealthy obsession with fighting games.</p>  <p>What started with Street Fighter II on the arcades and the SNES went on to more fighting games. He played all the fighting games he could get his angry hands on. Samurai Shodown, Fatal Fury, Street Fighter EX, Mortal Kombat, Blue Breaker Burst - name it and he's probably played it.</p>  <p>You might be thinking that since he's so into fighting games, which in nature is competitive, he must be a pretty competitive guy. The thing is, my <em>Kuya </em>hates to lose. Not the normal <em>&quot;Oh shit, I lost&quot;. </em>He hates losing so much, he blames it on the game itself. This has been often a topic of debate, quarrels and general punchfests over the years. If you've lived with this guy and found out how he plays his little fighting games, you're in for a treat.</p>  <p>Granted, he's gotten pretty good at any of the fighting games he's sat down with. He'll kick your ass in any Street Fighter installment or Tekken sequel. Unless you're a pro gamer.</p>  <p>What pisses me off is when he loses. Against the computer opponent. Imagine this - he starts swearing like a sailor in a hissy fit and hops up onto his feet. He scratches his head furiously, almost scalping himself. Then he begins to blame the AI and all hell breaks loose.</p>  <p><em>&quot;T******ng AI ka, bulok!&quot;</em></p>  <p><em>&quot;P*** KANG AI KA ANG DAYA MO!!!&quot;</em></p>  <p><em>&quot;Mamatay ka na, cheap moves p***!&quot;</em></p>  <p><em>&quot;T****A MO WAG KA NA LUMABAN, WAG KA NANG LUMABAN P***!&quot;</em></p>  <p><em>&quot;AYAW MAGPATALO P***!&quot;</em></p>  <p><em>&quot;WAG KA NANG LUMABAN SABI HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGRRR!&quot;</em></p>  <p>Holy crap, he's raging over a fighting game AI *gasp* that <em>fights </em>back! Why the hell would you want a fighting game that doesn't fight back? You'd be better off playing practice mode, you'll get your fill of non-fighting opponents. Isn't that the point of fighting games?</p>  <p>I've learned to just laugh at it and gave up on him a long time ago. Every now and then he'd be frothing at the mouth, shouting at the TV. All that rage must give him a bad case of hernia. I wonder if he still enjoys playing or just enjoys shouting at an inanimate object every few seconds.</p>  <p>My raging <em>Kuya</em>. Ever the couch fixture and gasket-blowing gamer. He's pretty nice when he's off the Playstation. Just don't beat him at the fighting games.</p>  <p>How about you? Does your family have any quirks like these? :)</p>"

"event","Guess what? She's done. I like the way the repair turned out. It's a different challenge from my other painting endeavors wherein I sand/putty something, paint the whole thing over with a different color.<br /><br />With Terranova, I had to match her skin color and adjust that perfect skin tone to make it just right. It took a few tries but it was well worth it. Check out the shots for the results.<br /><br />I had to mask her at first to see how it matches her skin tone. Notice that I further polished the repaired area with basic putty which gives a darker color.<br /><br />My airbrush isn't the best - in fact it sucks something fierce. A lot of adjusting and mixing the paint:thinner ratio to get the best spray. Sometimes it would spray whole particles and I'd have to get in and thinner the whole thing again.

I'm repairing her because she got wounded in the backside. Don't ask how or why.<br /><br /><a href=""http://shiromizu.livejournal.com/36943.html"">Previously</a>, we've applied Epoxy Putty to the chipped part and gave it 24 hours to cure (harden in layman's terms). After removing the masking tape that supported the underside of the gap, the exposed part cured quite well. The backside, however, was still a little raw.<br /><br />I smoothed it with water and heated it under a muted lamp to let it cure. For about 6 hours, I occasionally applied water to help it cure. I took a while, but it toughened up.<br /><br />Now, we need to sand the putty to level it with the skin and give it a smooth finish. I first start with a medium sanding sponge to remove excess putty and sand it down to an even level. These sanding sponges by 3M are particularly good for rounded materials because they shape and bend to the contour of the object you're sanding. Perfect for a doll bottom. <i><br /><br />(click thumbnails to enlarge)</i><br /><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y288/shiroel/BJD/07032008185.jpg""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y288/shiroel/BJD/th_07032008185.jpg"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />After that, I use a fine sanding sponge to polish the putty area, removing the scratches that the medium grit left. I also give it a pass with a 1800 grit sand paper to further buff the section.

For this kind of skin tone, I'll be using Tamiya flat acrylics. Flat white and flat flesh will do well for light skin tones.<br /><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y288/shiroel/BJD/07032008190.jpg""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y288/shiroel/BJD/th_07032008190.jpg"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />There's a lot of trial and error, getting just the perfect skin tone isn't as easy as I thought.

Anyway, I mixed and mixed and mixed.<br /><br />It isn't the closest tone and it gets really frustrating after like 20+ tries.

Before I dabbled into the magic of inhaling fumes, I first took a good look at the skin under sunlight and just basically assessed what colors could be in this mix of pale skin. I then looked at my paints and got an idea. Why not use a tinge of yellow?<br /><a href=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y288/shiroel/BJD/TN13.jpg"" target=""_blank""><br /><img border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y288/shiroel/BJD/th_TN13.jpg"" /></a><br /><br />So I did, and the result is pretty close to exact. That's 12 parts white, 1 part flesh and 1 part yellow. All these are flat acrylics so the texture will still be distinguishable.<br /><br /><a href=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y288/shiroel/BJD/TN14.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y288/shiroel/BJD/th_TN14.jpg"" /></a><br /><br />Now that I've got the skin tone down, I'm waiting for the airbrush to come in and give this an even and slightly glossy finish. I find that I kinda like doing this, a lot different from building weapons of mass destruction.<br /><br />Stay tuned for updates. :)"

Bow down before random facts about Vin Diesel.

<img src=""http://www.sera-chan.com/sera/vin.jpg"">

Every dollar Vin Diesel makes goes to setting up lavish expeditions where he kills a rare or legendary creature. As a followup to this Vin Diesel used to bathe in unicorn blood, but no longer needs to bathe as he has transcended beyond the mortal world's filth.

If you rearrange the letters in Vin Diesel it reveals his credo: ""I End Lives"".

Vin Diesel eats his weight in Tom Cruise every morning.

Vin once went sledding in New Hampshire and broke the sound barrier by turning his head around and blowing forcefully. As a result of the shock waves, several children died. Vin ascended to heaven and repeatedly punched God in the eye until he brought them all back to life. Every single one of those children are now scientists.

All roads lead to Vin Diesel.

 Vin Diesel single-handedly started the industrial revolution.

Unbeknownst to many, Vin Diesel actually invented walking. ""I'm glad it caught on,"" says the humble star.

Vin Diesel has solved all of history's greatest problems with ho-slappings and his unique ability to ejaculate anti-matter.

Vin Diesel already knows the next thing you will type.

Vin Diesel once built a stairway to heaven, but had it destroyed in favour of an elevator.

Vin Diesel exists slightly out of phase with the rest of our reality, which is why he appears to shimmer with an otherworldly light.

The 10 Commandments, the Stone Tablets that Moses received from God on Mount Sinai, were too heavy to carry for an old man but God knew this so he sent Vin Diesel to help the old man.

Vin Diesel cannot hear the word Onomatopoeia uttered in his presence. If it is he will stamp his foot three times and then dissolve into a pool of locusts that will devour New Hampshire.

Vin Diesel single handedly built the pyramids. He isn't vain, so he let the egyptians take the credit.

Vin Diesel spelled backward and upside down is the actual name of God. If uttered aloud, it would undo the very fabric of reality.

All Spell Checkers are actually mini Vin Diesels inside your computer. This is possible due to the fact that when Vin Diesel is cut into pieces each piece becomes a smaller and more verbose Vin Diesel.

The Carthaginians actually rode Vin Diesel across the Alps.

"event","I love you with all I am
And all I'll ever be.
You are my moon, my sun and stars,
My earth, my sky, my sea.

My love for you goes down and down
Beneath both life and death,
So deep it must remain when I
Have drawn my last faint breath.

Holding you for months and years
Will make Time disappear,
Will make your lips my lips, your face
My face, your tear my tear;

Will make us one strange personage
All intertwined in bliss,
Not man or woman, live or dead--
Just nothing--but a kiss!"

Sam and I are back in Illinois and (sort of) settled into our house. It's really great to have a whole house to mess up and hang around in. The cat loves it! I'll put up some pictures sometime.
I'm back at Illinois State this fall. It's going pretty well so far. My class are all pretty interesting so far, but the reading is slightly outrageous for my politics class. Five novels?? Seriously??? And my teacher for that class tries to dress super trendy. However, he doesn't understand French cuffs. Oh well.
The wedding is coming up in 281 days, according to my countdown.&nbsp; I have a dress that I really like, but I'm going to go dress shopping some more with Erin soon. I also have to get all those crazy ladies to look at bridesmaid dresses. I've also been looking for stuff to make the centerpeices with, but I'm not finding much. If you know of anywhere to get cheap fishbowls/vases or those little marble things, let me know.&nbsp;
I think that's good for now. I have to go and make a classroom layout plan for class. Hooray for not having class until eleven!

It's been getting super-duper warm outside over the past few days and it makes me super happy. Currently, it's 43 degrees. I walked around today without my coat on. How amazing!

There isn't really a whole lot going on in my life, as usual. I went down to Illinois last weekend. I spend Friday night/Saturday morning with Erin in Pekin and then went to Bloomington on Saturday/Sunday morning and stayed with Anna. I had a ton of fun in both towns and it was great getting a chance to catch up with everyone. I sent a Valentine's Day card to Rachael and Katie and Katie sent me a super sweet letter with some pictures. It made me very happy. I love hearing from my friends. (HINT HINT, that probably means you!)

School has been going pretty well. I'm president of the Geology Club now and it's kinda stressful because we have stuff coming up that hasn't been fully planned. Oh well. Also, I still don't have a placement for observing. My teacher said she can't find anywhere because I need to be available more times during the day. I have three hours open on three different days! How is that not enough time?! Whatever. I'm just kinda stressed because I need 20 observation hours and I'm not sure I'll be able to get it done.&nbsp;

My mom and my sister are coming to visit this weekend. I'm excited, but mostly because my mom will buy me lots of stuff. I need new nice clothes for work and teaching. And I just need stuff, or rather, I just want stuff. And my mom hasn't seen our new apartment yet (I know, it's been almost a year!).

Well, that's it for now...

"event","I rarely ever update, and I think I'm going to start doing it more often. I'm&nbsp; always upset when my friends don't update enough since I barely ever get to see them, so I figured I should update more often, too.
So, here's what's been up with me.&nbsp;
I started my new job at the Reiman Gardens Gift Shop last week. I like working there a lot so far. The latest it's open is 4:30, so that gives me all of my nights for hanging out with Sam and doing homework. It's pretty slow right now so I'm not getting to work that often, but I don't mind.
Classes started last week. They're all going okay so far. We'll see how they all end up. I'm the only girl in a few of my classes and it's really strange. I also have the same lab teacher I had last year that I really don't like. I'm trying to deal with it, though.
I took Mr. Kitty-butts into the vet on Monday. He had some type of worms, poor baby! But he's okay now. He's currently laying behind my computer, probably getting ready to take a nice nap.&nbsp;
Hopefully I'll be able to make it back down to Illinois soon. When I come down next, I think I'll stay in Pekin for a night, then go down to Bloomington. Maybe I'll be able to go down in February sometime.&nbsp;

Well, that's really about it. Nothing much has been going on here. Except that the cat just sneezed on the back of my computer. SICK!

I'll just keep it short for this one. I have two tests I'm worried about, one today and one tomorrow. I have no tests on Wednesday or Friday, which rocks. And my latest test is today at 2. So, all in all, not that bad.

I'm going home next Monday. Sunday is my last day at JCPenney (yes!). I can't wait to go home and see my mom! It's been forever since I saw her because she was working out of town the last time I was home. And I'll hopefully get to see Rachael and Anna and everyone else. I'm going to miss Sam and my kitty, too, though. ): We're doing Christmas with my dad's side of the family on Friday the 22nd, and then I'm coming back down to Ames on Saturday so that Sam and I can go down to Decatur. We're bringing the kitty with us, so that should be an adventure. I might bring the leash with so he can go outside for a little bit on the way. That reminds me that I have to clean out my car... Danny said we could keep Rex at his house. I hope he didn't change his mind...&nbsp;

"event","<p>It's Friday and I don't even have anything to look forward to. Three classes, Geology Club meeting, then work. Such an exciting life I lead...</p>
<p>And speaking of classes, they're all going pretty well. I'm going to give an overview of them now so I can see how different I feel about them at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>Religion 205-Introduction to World Religions: I like this class a lot. The teacher is really cool and really laid back and we don't really have many assignments. Not a whole lot of reading, either, so I'm all about that. The teacher spends most of the class telling us stories about his family, like how he and his wife got married in Vegas by an Elvis impersonator(totally true, we saw pictures), and I enjoy that.&nbsp;<br /><br />Geology 100-The earth: Mostly stuff I already know. You can tell this class was designed for Freshmen because it reminds me of high school. I'm not worried about this class at all. But the teacher is nice and she tries to make it interesting.<br /><br />Geology 100L-The Earth Lab: They shouldn't even call it a lab. We have yet to do anything lab related. It's two hours at night (7-9) and we just sit there and work on problems out of the lab book after our TA tries to explain stuff to us. Of course, we don't understand her because she's nervous as hell and doesn't speak English that well. At least she's trying, I guess.<br /><br />Curriculum and Instruction 204-Social Foundations of American Education: Gripe #1: the name of the class is too long. But I guess that's it. The material is kind of boring (it's basically the history of Education in America) and I want to nominate the teacher for What Not to Wear. It's the longest hour and fifteen minutes of my day.<br /><br />Astronomy 150-Stars, Galaxies, and Cosmology: I read an article last year about my teacher for this class and how he wanted to teach an Intelligent Design class here, so I was a little worried about how he would teach, but other than lame jokes, he's fine. The class sucks. We have yet to learn about anything astronomy related, just physics and chemistry type stuff. I just keep telling myself that it will get better.<br /><br />Geology 311-Mineralogy: The teacher for this class is my advisor and when I first met him, I thought he was mean, but he's totally not. He's a nice guy with big glasses that make his eyes look huge. He makes me laugh, though. This is probably going to be my toughest class, but I have confidence. Plus, all of the other students are really nice and I know they'll help out if I need it.<br /><br />Geology 311L-Mineralogy and Optical Mineralogy Lab: These two labs aren't that bad. One is hand identification and the other is working with microscopes. The microscopes give me a headache, but I guess that's just an occupational hazard.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, that's basically it. My 18 credits. School's going alright so far. I have some trips planned on weekends (going home on the 16th maybe, going to Bloomington the 29th, and Jon and Allie's wedding on the 7th!!) that I'm very excited about. I've also been a reading machine, so I'm feeling pretty positive about that, too. I need to write letters and send them out, but I'm lazy. I'm trying, I promise!<br /><br />Time to get ready for class.<br />-Stephanie</p>"

Bonus points if you can find my car!<br /><br />I like being here, but it's very lonely. I can't wait until Sam gets here.<br />Oh, and the smoke detector is VERY sensitive. Every time I've used the oven, it goes off! I tried making cookies last night, but stopped after one batch because it went off! And then, it went off again today when I was making mini corn dogs. I also decided that when I have a house of my own, I'm getting a gas oven. No electric for me. I don't like having the bottom of everything burned to a crisp while the rest is not done. Oh well. I guess I'll just make do with the toaster oven.<br /><br />So, that's it. There's the lovely new apartment. Visitors are always welcome!&nbsp;<br /><br />Stephanie"

<span class=""blacktextnb10""><font face=""verdana"" size=""2"">50 of the MOST random questions ever...<br /><br />1.

When is the last time you filled up your gas tank?<br />The last time <strong><em>I</em> </strong>filled it up? I think it was In Davenport-ish on my way home from Decatur. My dad filled it up last weekend for me.<br /><br />3. What is the most amount of money you spent in one store?<br />I don't know. I tend to spend a lot of money online. I don't know the last time I spent more than $50 on myself at any store.&nbsp;<br /><br />4. Is there anything pink within 10 feet of you?<br />Do you know who you're asking?! I'm wearing a pink sweatshirt, there's a pink cup&nbsp;on my desk, a pink heart photo album (from Erin's mom for V-Day last year), my piggy bank, more photo albums, a&nbsp;pink basket, pink Hello Kitty&nbsp;band-aids, etc...&nbsp;<br /><br />5. When is the last time you went to the mall?<br />I was at the&nbsp;mall last Sunday for work. I'm going back later tonight.&nbsp;<br /><br />6. Are you wearing socks right now?<br />Of course.

Do you have any single friends?<br />I don't have many friends, but I do have some single friends.<br /><br />25. Last play you saw?<br />I'm sure it was something in High School. I have no idea.<br /><br />26. Have you been to New York?<br />No, and&nbsp;to be honest, I'd be a little scared to go.&nbsp;<br /><br />27. What are your plans for tonight?<br />Work until 10, hopefully catching the rerun of the new What Not to Wear. That's about it.<br /><br />28. Last concert you went to?<br />Jason Mraz, I think.

I was hot, I couldn't breathe, my throat hurt, my shoulders hurt, and I just couldn't find a comfortable position. So I got up, turned on the AC and got some juice, then crawled back into bed. I woke up again sometime during the night because I had a horrible dream that involved Sam. I don't remember what it was now, but I woke up making the crying noise, but not actually crying. Then I finally woke up at 6:47, as I do on most mornings, and my entire body hurts. I'm either getting sick or have allergies, but either way I feel like crap. I have my advisor meeting today after physics and I register for classes tomorrow. Hopefully that all works out well and I get into all of my classes and my advisor doesn't tell me I'll be here for two more years than I thought. We'll see...

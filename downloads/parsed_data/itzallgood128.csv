<P>yea..to anyone reading this.. if someone says that.. u might not want to trust them.. they will lie..unless they are a better person than this individual.. im so pissed.. i hate it.. she lied right to my face.. i mean seriously..i obviously trust the other person more.. they told the truth.. u lied.. u lie to my face whenever i ask about it.. im not that mad that u said something.. but dont lie about it.. that hurts worse than anything..i learned my lesson with you.. i just wish i could have before i told u that..u probably told everyone by now..would be mad if u were me? y did u ask my sister.. a million times i told u.. i HATE her.. like she would know anything about me anyway..wat if i decided to lie to you.. look u in the eye and deny everything..y do ppl do that..</P>
<P>im so pissed of right now.. i hate everyone in my family.. i want to leave but i have no where to go.. i have no one to turn to.. my mom favors my sister because nobody can stand it when she throws her fits..so this is what happened.. i had an extra half hr online b/c my mom messed up when she was doin something to the parental controls.. b/c i had that 1/2 hr my sister decided she wanted to go online.. so i let her..the computer signed her off immediately.. she flipped out.. tried to beat the crap out of me n was hitting all the walls n crap like that.. n wen i went back on she pulled the plug out of the wall. n then my mom came home and changed the time so that i only had until 9 all week.. my sister however had until 930 on weeknights and 10 on weekends.. so all week i asked her to change it..but of course she wouldnt.. cuz im not my sister n i dont throw fits to get my way.. so i yelled at my mom today.. after a whole week of even more limited access on the computer.. n i tried to sign on her name to change her password and everything.. so i told her that i was one step away from changing her password so she came out and screamed her head off at me.. like always.. my sister would get away with anything but if i do it i get in trouble.. n since i rarely do anything bad she brings up stuff from like weeks ago and even crap from last year.. she told me i was a bad kid who needed all these restrictions online b/c i stole frome the mall (once and only once about a month ago i guess) and she yelled at me for skipping class.. which i did once last year.. n she yelled at me for being friends with people who want to die their hair n get piercings.. yea.. cuz any of that crap matters..so she cam right up to my face n hit me a couple of times and screamed for like an hour in my face about absolutely nothing..ppl wonder why i can barely hear them..mentally unstable people scream in my ears for no reason..i hate my family so much.. last night at the award ceremony my mom insisted on coming.. i told her i didnt want her there n that parents were not allowed but she had to come anyway.. i hate her so much.. my family is embarassing.. im 15 i dont need them to be by my side anymore.. i really dont want them there either.. this week has been so bad.. the only good day was monday..n i know why.. but tuesday wasnt so great n neither was weds, thurs, and today..of course all this crap has to happen wen me and someone who means a lot to me are kinda having a fight.. one day they were mad at me n now im mad at them.. it sucks but life goes on.. its kinda good in a way.. im realizing that they arent so important to me.. they betrayed me n i dont really need someone like that in my life.. they still mean so much but.. its just gunna b different now.. i wont NEED to be next to them all the time.. i need my space.. n i think they do too..idk.. im really pissed right now&nbsp;i was thinking before about leaving but i was like where can i go and spend the night w.o telling my mom or anything.. heathers?.. no.. shes in boston.. stacy?.. no shes goin to florida.. i couldnt even go to my dads cuz he went to see his father.. n i dont really know fays family to well so i dont wanna put them out.. so i was outta options.. so i got stuck here in this hell hole with the people i hate.. </P>

"event","Well, I tried to do this last night but it didn't work because I clicked the thing the wrong way and it closed itself somehow. It didn't save anything from the entry. I remember I was going to talk about my sucky week. I know that because i don't even remember Monday i didn't mention anything about it. I kinda remember some stuff about Tuesday. It was Multicultural Food Day in ROTC. I had a wonton from Emilyn. It was really good but i almost puked it up everywhere because I've been sick. Thats all i had at the whole food day thing. Then i finished the day and stayed after to talk to lea. It never happened. It was supposed to. I waited while she took a test. Roni, Jess!!!, and I were just hanging at Roni's locker. I missed Jess so much last year. She left over Christmas vacation and never came back, until this year. So they gave up and left and i waited. I told them to give me like five minutes and if i wasn't doin anything I'd meet them at the library. I was at my locker and i saw lea so i was walking with her for a little while. I asked her if she was done but i don't think i ever got an answer so i thought that was where she was going.  I was right behind her but then i looked down and she was gone so i thought she went to finish her test or something. I went for a walk because i told her to call me when she was ready. I met up with Roni and Jess and we went to the library. They were going crazy because they needed to smoke their cigarettes. Then we were talking about all the stuff Jess did and it suprised me because i thought she was such a good girl. She seemed like an angel last year when we would always hang out in the morning and in gym. Roni started talking about how Jess has done so much crap. She gets drunk every now and then. That really didn't suprise me because i know losts of people around my age who get drunk. Then she said how Jess has smoked weed and used ectasy. So then they were having their own little conversation and i was just staring at the school. I saw lea leave so i called her. Of course, she didn't answer. Someone else did and they were lieing to me about who they were with and everything. As if i didn't see them walking to the deli together. So we went back to the school and i was in the road screaming the worst word i knew at them. Of course, Jess was being all angelic and said she really hated that word, but i had to do it again because i was that pissed. Then all of Roni and Jess' friends were hanging out in the hallway so i stayed with them.  Then Andrew walked by so i stayed with him. I knew that he was on my bus because i have known him since like seventh grade and i used to walk to his house because he lives by Mike, Heather, and Ryan. So we were standing there at the West platform and i went around to say hi to everyone i knew. At this point lea decides to call. I don't even know why because i ignored each phone call in fear i would say or do something i would regret. I got on the bus, went home, and managed my anger. 

Wednesday. Well, I remembered on the bus i got hit with a wave of really bad depression. I almost started crying in ROTC but i got the tears to go back in and was able to blame the water-y-ness on a long powerful yawn. So then i went to lunch and needed to talk to Marilyn. So, luckily, Stacy had ""some business to attend to"" during lunch. I took Marilyn out of the lunch room but there were too many people in the hallway for my liking. So we went to the bathroom and went into a stall because there were to many people in there too.  I showed her; I had been crying the whole way to the bathroom because the whole situation depressed me and I couldn't hold it in any longer. When Marilyn figured it out she almost cried too. We just stayed there for a while, as she was holding me in comfort, until the eye-puffiness went down. Then we went back to lunch. I went to the rest of my classes just like any ordinary day. Then i stayed after because the whole day i was asking lea to stay after. All she sed was ""idk"" so i thought she was going to. At the end of the day i was at my locker with Kristal and Stacy. Then Kristal left because she wasn't going to stay after. She came back just as lea walked by and said she wasn't going to stay after. Then Stacy left and so did Kristal. I was just with Marilyn and i told her i would walk her to detention. Then i saw Kristal again and she stayed for a little while to take a test. I was on the phone with lea for a while trying to work this crap out. It was going okay but then i saw Marilyn walk over to me and she didn't look right. I wasn't sure at first but then her eyes got really red. I told lea i had to go and i think i sounded mad and i wanted to apologize and explain that i had to help Marilyn with this because she helped me a little earlier that day. Then we went to get some food from Stacy's locker but it was bad. It must have been at least two days old. It was so gross. Then Marilyn left because her mom picked her up. So again i was alone. I called Roni and she was coming to the school to get her books so i was with her for the little while. Then she got her friend to drive her home. Again i was alone. I went back to school and got my books. Then i waited for the bus and Failynn ditched me for JD... GEEEEZZEE!!! Then i had a panic attack because i thought i missed the bus. I would have been stuck there until five if i missed the bus. Good thing i didn't! It's just always the last bus there i guess. I forgot to mention another thing about Marilyn. When she went to get her books she dropped a hint about something she might do later. I didn't pick up at that moment. When she was gone i realized what she was saying. I called her immediately to tell her not to do it. She didn't answer. I was kinda scared that night thinking about it. I was scared as i thought that if i saw something the next day i wouldn't forgive myself. I knew what she meant and i could have stoped it but i didn't. 

So now today.. I went to the bus stop and had to run back home to get my geometry project. I don't do well in the cold. My lungs practically stop working. By the time i got back to the bus stop i was about ready to pass out. Then i went on the bus and just sat there looking out the window. I thought i was going to puke. It really didn't help that the kid behind me kept breathing his nasty smelling breath into my seat. Then i got off the bus and was walking with Toni like i usually do. I got into school and went to my locker. I guess Leah saw me come in and came up to me with this devious look on her face. I figured out what it was about and i was like ""NO!"". I spent to much time on that project last night just to have her wreck it before i handed it in. Then i was telling her how i felt like i was going to puke so i sat next to the garbage can. She said she would help me get the lid off if i couldn't do it and puke at the same time. (Thanks!) Then i got a call from Stacy saying she was goin to meet me at my locker. Then Kristal came around and scared the crap out of me by slaming her crap on the desk i had my head on. Then i told her how crapy i felt and then she asked for some gum and i couldn't open it with out getting really sick feeling. So i told her to. She realized i wasn't joking so she just asked for my combination to my locker so she could put her stuff in there. Then we stayed until Stacy came. We just sat there for a little while as  i tried not to puke. Then lea's friend pilon's sister came over to me. I thought she was just going to say hi. I did spend one morning with her and i thought that we could be friends. I guess there is just something wrong with that family. She started telling me how lea said that she doesn't ever want to talk to me again, she doesn't want me to call her, she just wants me gone, and to stop talking about pilon n crap like that. So, i knew that lea probably wouldn't send someone over to me to tell me BS like that she would do it herself. I asked her if lea said this or if her sister said this. She sed ""o no lea said all this"". Then Stacy was all like i dont want to get involved. So i told her to go to her locker. Kristal, however, didnt want to go to Stacy's locker yet. So i told Kristal to come with me if she wanted to. As we left i saw that girl run by and tell lea something. Then i asked her what she told her to tell me and she's like ""wat?"". So i knew that flammer told her sister to say all that stuff. I was ready to kill her. i would have but i didn't want to get thrown out of school. All lea did was say no ur not going to touch her. The only thing that went through my head was that fine i'll get through u first. It won't be hard. Then i left because i knew i would definately do something i would regret. Then i went to Stacy's locker. Then went to drivers ed stayed for about ten minutes. Then asked to go to my locker and left. I was going to my locker and i saw lea and Javier. I dont know why i stayed with her. I cant remember if she was talking to me or whatever. But i stayed with her and Roni all first period. Then walked with her to math n stayed there but i didnt want the sub to mark me absent so i left there n went to bio. Then in Dr.'s class i asked to go to the bathroom and went for a walk with Roni. Then we picked up her friend. Then i sat in math almost dieing from sickness. then went to ROTC and almost died again. I remember the best part of my day. LUNCH!!! JACK WAS BACK IN SCHOOL!!!! then went to english and started to feel a little better. We had to do the WOD crap things again. In history i fell asleep. Made me feel so much better! I was walking with Kristal and she asked if her face was red and i said a little. then i asked her and she said no. Then we meet up with Stacy and she was like ""HOLY CRAP WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE! WERE U SLEEPING OR SOMETHING!"" i just looked at Kristal and laughed. Then i went to spanish and then left to go on a walk. Yes, that was a twenty minute walk!! I'm proud. it was fun. i was by myself for a while then i found Ryan and we talked for like 2 mins then me n Leah walked the rest of the school. Then we went back to spanish and taped my desk so it wouldn't be able to flip open like it usually does. Then the bell rang. The best part of the day. 

I'm just going to go on about things i don't get. Things i hate. And things i do when im alone.
I dont get people, i dont get how u can care so much for someone who treats you like your worthless, i dont get proofs!!, i dont get why all of a sudden Stacy keeps things from me, i dont get why i do the things i do, I dont get why i get so depressed when im alone, i dont get why i go into depression mood whenever there isn't a friend by my side, i dont get why things happen, i dont get why life sucks, i dont get how people say high school is suposed to be the time of your life when it really hurts you worse than anything in the world, i dont get how i can have a crush so soon when i think im fallin out of love, i dont get why i always have to get hurt, i dont get why i think about all the saddest things, i dont get why i cry so much over one person i might not have even met, i dont know why i didnt do all honors classes freshman year like i should have, i dont like thinking about wat if i went to Mon Don like my mom wanted me to, i don't get why people kill themselves when there are people who have no choice about living.. i guess thats all for now. Im bored with this."

 i need time to think, i need some time to be alone, as i stand in the shadows of the past and watch as the world goes by... sit in the darkness that is my future and try to find the light... i need some time alone, i need some time to think. just shut the door and close the curtains and let the darkness spread and i shall be swallowed up by the shadows as i think about my past and worry about my future. (thats like wat marilyn thinks about me..shes afraid of my future)

""Bed of Roses""

Underneath this bed of roses
A soul decomposes
Alone in the dark
No sense of movement
No sense of sound
Sloitude is found
Alone in the dark
No sense of movement
No sense of light
lost forever
is the morning sunlight
Underneath this bed of roses
A soul decomposes
Along with the Roses
As the age together and wither away
Only for them to grow back
Someday...

"event","Last night i had the best dream EVER..it made me so happy that i didnt want to ever wake up.. it sucks because i obviously did. it was weird because everything was CRAZY in the beginning.. so much drama.. so many tears.. everything worked out perfectly.. i was sooo happy. i havent been that happy in the longest time. this dream.. which was so0o0o fictional...makes me hope that maybe it'll happen in real life.. it was so great whenever i get that thought in my head that makes me so miserable im just going 2 put this in my head cuz this is truely my DREAM for the future..i just cant get over it it makes me so happy..

then reality hits me.. the pain comes back.. i just want to know if u care about me.. if u do y would u do all this to me.. u no i hate the pain.. its just to much and im 2 weak... just tell me and change it for next time...."

"event","so its a saturday morning all i have 2 do is write in my journal.. wat a life i tell u..so yesterday was a pretty boring day Lea wasn't in school so i was pretty sad n jus moped around all day until i got home.  i missed her =(.  then since i was alone in science i was thinking about the list stacy told me 2 make but i never actually got around 2 making it b/c i had homework i needed to do in school so i dont end up failing.  then i got home went online 4 my usual 4 mins cuz my mom took away my time n then went upstairs... im not 2 sure if i took a nap or jus laid in my bed..that happens alot.. i dont remember if i actually fell asleep. then i remember the fonr rang and YAY!!! my moping~around day turned around b/c Lea called.. then it made me extra happy that she sed she called me cuz she knew i'd miss her the most.( now that is 1 smart kid , i didnt even have 2 tell her she jus new... it almost brought a tear 2 my eye..) then we was talkin n stacy called so i did that thing where i cross the 2 house lines so every1 can talk.. i donno wat its called.. we had some good conversations and annoying interuptions from my sister.. then we all hung up n stacy called n three-wayed lea n we was all talkin again.. then stacy left n i called lea back n we got in2 1 of r DEEP converstations.  then she had 2 go sumwhere n sed she call back but she didnt.. prolly cuz Stacy called.. we were gunna do sumthin but never got around 2 it so mayb we can do sumthin 2day.  then stacy had 2 go n then my aunt called n i was trying 2 get her off the fone but then  i went 2 my room 2 wait n i fell asleep.. then i woke up n it was like 12:30 n im like no1 is gunna call me now so i went back 2 bed n then i woke up this morning n im so bored i finished most of my homework... thats all i ever do on weekends.. ok now 4 the other stuff.. the confusing stuff...i got up n i was all sad b/c there is only like 2 or 3 weeks of school left. i dont really like school or nething but i see a lot of my friends there.  im afraid that during the summer im gunna lose all the friends i made.  i get sad wen i think about how im prolly not gunna c lea cuz she is gunna work all summer n last summer stacy was busy so i was left home alone w/o her 2 talk 2 on the fone or c her @ all.  i get really sad wen i dont c lea over the weekend n thats usually jus 2 days how m i gunna make it through the summer.. jus 4 all u wierd ppl out there im not in love w/ her or nething im straight n i no that.. its jus sumtimes i worry about her like she sumtimes worries about me. ive never had sum1 like her that i can tell nethin i want 2 n no that she will understand n not use it against me or anything.. i no she will always b there 4 me n be on my side whenever i need her.. n i'll b there 4 her...i dont no wat i'd do w/o her.."

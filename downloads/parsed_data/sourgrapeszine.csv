"event","I find myself thinking again, wouldn't it be nice to have a place where I can review my thoughts on my print zine <a href=""http://myspace.com/sourgrapeszine"">SOURGRAPES</a>? Then I remember WHOA! I do have a place!<br /><br />Its here.<br />Over the past couple months and with the release of our first issue Knowledge- SG has grown..alot! Just to mention a few changes:<br /><br />- We are no longer a just a submission zine. We got smart about things and have now decided to hire up a full-time zine team! Not only does this save poor Sam ALOT of trouble but it also keeps us up to date, organized, and in touch! We're hiring people we know we can rely on to submit each issue deadline. Laid back kids with D.I.Y. ethics, open minds, and loads to say! The reaction to this change and the amount of people wanting to join has been great and our staff is almost full.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>We are still looking for:<br /></strong>- Record reviewers <br />- Zine reviewers <br />- D.I.Y. guide writers<br />- Survival guide writers<br />- Bike Repair guide writers<br />- Cover artists (For upcoming covers)<br />- Proof readers<br />- + more<br /><br /><strong>(If you think you would like to help us out or could be of service write us at </strong><a href=""mailto:sourgrapeszine@gmail.com""><strong>sourgrapeszine@gmail.com</strong></a><strong> or through myspace </strong><a href=""http://myspace.com/sourgrapeszine""><strong>http://myspace.com/sourgrapeszine</strong></a><strong>)</strong> <br /><br />- <strong>OUR DEADLINES</strong> have also changed. Bi monthy was too hard (for all of us) even though I thought I didnt have a life- it seems the entire team has had trouble keeping up the bi-monthly promise. We've decided to go Quarterly. That means an issue will come out every 3 months. Not only it is easier on us, our submissions, and readers, but it also allows us to create a much better, more organized zine!<br /><br /><strong>DEADLINES:</strong><br />JANUARY 1ST<br />APRIL 1ST **&nbsp;<br />JULY 1ST<br />OCTOBER 1ST<br /><br />- When it comes to printing- SG will still be printed as a half size zine but upcoming issues will be printed on light weight, cheap, newsprint. Prices stay at .50 cents an issue or less- free if we can help it :)<br /><br />Once again, I'm still looking for reliable zinesters to be a part of our zine team. We cant pay you (were dirt poor) but we can offer free ad space, zine reviews, band reviews, and more.<br /><br />IF YOU HAVE A BAND OR ZINE YOU'D LIKE TO GET REVIEWED: Please write <a href=""mailto:sourgrapeszine@gmail.com"">sourgrapeszine@gmail.com</a><br />We're also going to offer AD's in our zine for pretty low prices.<br /><br />Thats all I got right now kids. Keep warm and safe.<br />SAM<br />SG ZINE<br /><a href=""http://myspace.com/sourgrapeszine"">http://myspace.com/sourgrapeszine</a><br /><br /><br />"

We heavily rely on reader-submissions and focus on what we love such as art, music reviews, D.I.Y. guides, freevies, articles, and our ideas on feminism, war, racism, ethics, love, and life.<br /><br />Each 8th day of the month we start a new&nbsp;zine theme.&nbsp;The month is themed for writers who need to be 'inspired' but most of our reading has nothing to do with that months theme. :) You can find our theme on our <a href=""http://blog.myspace.com/sourgrapeszine"">myspace blog</a> and soon to be here!&nbsp;<br /><br />All submissions end on the 30th of the month.<br /><br /><strong><u>To submit to sourgrapes:<br /></u></strong>Send us mail to: <a href=""mailto:girlnamedsam@gmail.com"">girlnamedsam@gmail.com</a><br />Label the email ""Sourgrapes Submission!"" and attach your word documents, photos, art, ect. to the email.&nbsp;<br />Or add us and write our myspace: <a href=""http://myspace.com/sourgrapeszine"">http://myspace.com/sourgrapeszine</a><br /><br />Sourgrapes is not an Sourgrapes is not an online zine. We are a hardcopy zine so ask your distros for us! We're always looking for new distributors.

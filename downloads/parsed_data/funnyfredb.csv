"event","Matt, 

I finally got a chance to watch the movie. It's good. But, let me get to my criticisms. I have no expertise in this area so I am just telling you my opinion strictly as a viewer. 

Before I do that: My thought is that you are either happy with the movie or you are not and that, at this point, you might be more interested in putting it behind you than improving it (or trying to improve it, or whatever). I would like to encourage you to not only muster the strength to improve it, but to have perfection as your goal. <lj-cut>

(1) On a practical note-- it is totally obvious that everyone is saying ""Bothwell"". So much so that it seems odd that you don't just have them say the name. There may be some outside reason (e.g. I know you show a joke where he says he might embarrass his family), but-- since it is obvious what his last name is-- you might want to consider cutting it. 

(2) If the film has a fundamental shortcoming, it is this: I am not sure an objective viewer will understand why the movie was made exactly. There is some sense that there is a true human interest story under it all (namely when Fred tells his story of growing up and the imposed failures), but it never quite settles. We understand he is odd. We understand he does comedy. We understand he is kind. We understand he likes hugs, Texas, taking off his shirt, etc. But, those aspects may not be tied together to create an understanding of Fred. 
(A) From what I know, Fred has an actual social disorder. This is apparent from the interviews with his sister and his relationship with his family. This is the elephant in the movie-- what is the NAME of that disorder? Why is there no medical history mentioned? If the movie is aimed at understanding Fred (and I assume it must be), why is this stone unturned? 
(B) My opinion is that any actual debate about whether Fred's personality is an act is misplaced. I say this for a few reasons: (1) if there is an actual debate (and I don't think there is), the film does not really come close to making the debate look even-sided-- an interview from Jay LaFarr and an unnamed Dallas comic does not create a debate; (2) the thoughts that Fred is faking are better placed in the context of making it all the more difficult for him to be understood; (3) I think the story is more interesting if we assume Fred has a problem and the question is: how does it affect (or effect) his comedy and how does his comedy affect it? 

(3) There are some really good moments in the film. In particular, I enjoy (not actually enjoy) seeing Fred's disappointment at not placing in the contest; the two african-american ladies who continue to harass him; and Fred's childhood story. I wish, however, that all this (and the entire film) was tied to a theme. For instance, we have several segments in the films (among others) (a) Fred does stand up (b) Fred likes hugs (c) Fred likes Texas (d) Fred likes girls (e) Fred knows trivia. BUT WHY? Does he tell Texas jokes because its the first place he felt at home? (His sister mentions something to that effect-- why not put two and two together in editing?). As a side note-- each segment goes on longer than is needed. 

(4) Continuing from Number 3: I think you have a deeper knowledge of Fred than the audience. As a result, you try to structure your film in such a way that lets the audience know what you want them to know about Fred. To some extent this is good, but to some extent, I think you are cheating. Case in point: an explanation of Fred is incomplete without medical testimony. I had a hard time getting past that. 

(5) I know you don't want to, but I would re-examine the entire order of the film. I don't just mean the actual editing; I mean the outline. Instead of a section head ""Fred Likes Hugs"", I think you need a section head ""Fred's Condition is Lonely."" Then, instead of a segment about hugs, and one comment about loneliness, you work to create a picture of Fred's isolation (OR WHATEVER). On a similar note, the competition bit was sad, but it seemed somewhat random-- there was no anticipation or build... just all of a sudden you are going around the state to open mics and then BAM the competition (and movie) is over. That should not only have more build, but should not be in a section headed ""FPIA 2006"", but ""Fred Stuggles to Succeed."" And, I don't mean that the ""Fred's Condition is Prone to Failure."" And, I am not suggesting the section needs to be in one block at the end of the film-- only that the FPIA is part of something, not something in and of itself. 

(6) I would both limit and expand the interviews. Honestly, I don't like the interviews with Marz. Partly because I find that he is trying to be funny and partly because they are in a sound booth. Other than that, the interviews are fine, but not entirely diverse. His sister and brother-in-law represent his family (that is fine, but tell us why). Then, you have a ton of interviews with comedians. I say too many. I also say we need to know why they are qualified to testify (e.g. ""J.C. Shakespeare is an Austin comedian who has known Fred for... etc.). Also, I find stories more illuminating than the interviewees actual thoughts. Lastly, as I have said previously, an explanation of Fred's actual condition might help. 

IN SUMMARY: As it stands now, I enjoyed the film. I suspect that is in part because I know Fred and partly because the film is good. However, I think the film could benefit from severe restructuring and, in fact, reconceptualizing. The overall question that needs answering: Why did this movie need to be made? i.e. WHO IS FRED (why is he worth a movie?), i.e. Is this story tragic? comedic? both? courageous?, etc. Once that is determined with absolute clarity, you may want to restructure, etc. 

This is meant to be helpful. I enjoyed the movie, but if you ask for criticism, I assume you want my thoughts. You are free to ignore them, of course.

AWESOME NOTES!
Body:
I didn't so much ""finish"" the film as I simply paused out of exhaustion

your comments are EXCELLENT! and VERY much appreciated!

I agree- there is no structure, no point, no arc.... it ends on a ""so what""

its funny how different people see different things

the black girls ""harassing him"" I saw it as HE was him harassing THEM, but many saw it your way


EVERYONE says make it shorter- and almost everyone says to give it a theme- make it about his disorder

This is an ongoing argument with fred and his parents

they want it to make him look good, to help his comedy career

I say- WHAT career- he isn't really trying to go pro- he really only wants to be a local character... he SAYS he wants to be a pro but I cant imagine him cutting the umbilical cord to his parents

its obvious SOMETHING is wrong- why not say what it is....?

no clubs gonna book him anyway- irregardless of my movie

it MIGHT help- SOME clubs might book him once they KNOW WHAT is wrong with him, he certainly isn't CRAZY in the dangerous sense (altho many get that first impression- no? didn't you?) he just has a social disorder, not different from many MANY comics, he's just MORESO, once its known whats wrong with him, he CAN he handled. San Antonio books him regularly, they KNOW he's got something wrong with him but they know WHAT it is and HOW to deal with it....

Im going to forward this note to freds dad...

I shot some material on his disorder- and am seriously considering putting it back"

Subject: Fred Movie 
    Hi Matt,

The DVD worked after all.  I just watched it and enjoyed it very much.

Some notes while it's fresh in my mind:<lj-cut>

Did Fred object to his last name being used?

There should be more name identification of people being interviewed.

The animation at the beginning goes on too long.  Use it sparingly
throughout.  The cat wiping scene will be funnier if shorter.

The whole final sequence, beginning with Fred working on new material,
goes on way too long and the ending is not very satisfying.

The middle is mostly very engaging and entertaining.  There's a place
in there that would make a good ending, I'd have to look again to make
a recommendation.

I wonder if all the stories about abuse are true.  
They almost seem like they could be figments of his imagination.  The way it plays, it doesn't matter if they are true or not.  The whole biographical sequence tells a lot about who Fred is and it's a very good presentation.

It would be nice to see his set the night he won 3rd FPIA.

Funniest scene for me - the cup story.  Maybe you can find a way to make one of Fred's stage appearances the funniest part of the movie.  He is
 so out there and sometimes he is surprisingly hilarious.  Of course,
 hilarity is always about the surprise.  I don't specifically recall the bit that cracked me up when seeing it live, it's covered in the movie, but it's about being dainty.

I remember the period when Fred would go up last at the Velv open mike
week after week and it became a ritual to throw stuff at him.  It always bothered me and I asked him if he liked it and he said, ""No.""  I told
 George that he should stop it and he shrugged off my suggestion.  I continued
 to respect George and the comics, but a little less so.  It was cruel in a
 very elementary school way, like taunting the kid who's ""different.""

There is a lot of love expressed for Fred in the movie which is great.

Fred is a unique individual, a brilliant man and a gifted comic with some kind of potential.  As long as he loves and is loved, that's all that 
really matters.

You have the makings of an excellent documentary.  Hope these notes
are helpful.

Austin J."

"event","Hi Mack!

I guess you are in California.
Please tell me where you roam and range.
You are likely touring many interesting Comedy clubs.
Matt is with me. 
Matt just did a paying gig in Chicago at Cigars and Stripes for Gino Martino. 
This is really Fred. 
That is a strange statement. 
Please make some On Line Films.
Matt helped me make YouTube.com videos.
We went to Houston to the new Laugh Stop.
I performed my set to a woman near the stage.
She had treated us to polite conversation before the show. 
My intensity was focused at pleasing her.
I did charm her with my performance.
Matt's video made it clear that I could have been more focused on confronting the crowd. 
The host who introduced me was offended when I tried to talk to him.
The host was a bald Persian man who was insulted that I suggested that he should dress for stage like the leader of the persian Army in the movie 300.
If you check RoofTopComedy.com you can see my 2007 Austins Funniest Contest set.
In Austin you were a wild thing.
On the west Coast you must seem more ordinary because you are with many like you.
Seen any hello kitty neck tattoos lately?"

"event","(Really written by Fred)

Hello.
    I am Fred B. and today I drove Matthew Kordelski to Houston Texas from Austin.
    The round trip from Austin to Houston and then back to Austin was costly.
    I paid for gas.
    I endured Matthew's insults about my appearance during the trip. 
I do not make it a habit to insult Matthew's appearance.
   Matthew spent much energy during the our ride screaming at the top of his lungs about violence and preverse sexual practices.
I felt some happiness about the prospect of making a short video of my stage performance in Houston.
 Matthew is a talanted film maker.
 Matthew is skilled at making shrill noises during long rode trips.
 Matthew can speak like Bill Cosby.
 Matthew can sing like Alfalfa of the little rascals.
 This night Matthew delighted in hearing his voice echo though the streets of quietly sleeping Texas towns.
Matthew hollared for pigs to get suey.
Matthew laughed loudly.
Matthew brought his camera to Houston and filmed my first performance at the new Laff Stop.
Matthew is annoyed that I want to have the 5 minute video we made in Houston posted on YouTube.com.
It could take many minutes to digitize, export and post.
Matthew's decision to Multi-task during this process slows it greatly.
This process may fail without warning.
Matthew knows that multi-tasking will increase the chance that the video posting process will fail.
If the video of my performance at the Houston Laff Stop is posted then I might study my techniques more closely.
 Although Matthew enjoys sharing with me emotional critiques of my performances I might gain more constructive information from his video.
Matthew has not lost an oppurtunity to complain to me about how difficult it is to post a 5 minute video on YouTube.com.
Matthew has many years of experience with computers.
Matthew has just completed two Austin Community College Courses for the purpose of making Computer Animations.
Matthew clearly understands that multi-tasking with his computer reduces the central processing unit's skill at doing its work.
Matthew refuses to do only one task at a time and can overburden the CPU with too many tasks at once.
Matthew has multi-tasked so that the video we made in Houston and another file are in danger of being corrupted.
Matthew said, ""I am glad we went to Houston. We had fun.""
Matthew posted the video from Houston on YouTube.com.
Thank You Matthew!

"event","2nd night at Homer's

Oh what fun we had at Homer's!
I meet Sean Lee Bailey and Brian.
A new stage was built facing north in Homer's!
The stage has powerful electronics and disco lighting.
The room has a contemporary decor that includes kooky designer lamps.
Newly carpeted floors, at least six circular tables allowed:
three dozen people to gather about and form an audience in comfort.
Sean Lee Bailey was a cheerful host of our: Homer's Comedy Night!
Bailey started strong and kept a happy playful attitude throughout the show.
Bailey was encouraging before the show and led by setting a good example. His introductions were speedy and polite.
The 'line up' included Mary Helen
or ""Hairy Melons""(check her My space).
Mary Helen sang powerfully as she told her stories.
Mary Helen likes a local band that does food fighting.
Matthew, Joel and myself enjoyed taking the stage.
Matthew charmed a good deal then offered a rude suggestion to a slightly elderly woman. She was talking loudly to her boy friend while Matthew demanded everyone's attention. Matthew lives by the creed: One must balance the freedoms of others to speak while telling them to shut the cake hole.
I met the owner: Homer!
Homer drank a cherry bomb with me.
We drank while our arms were linked.
Homer seems to be friendly and polite.
I was pleased to view in passing the inviting cleavage of the shapely women who tempted us around the bar. Despite the cold temperatures those women displayed themselves for our well being.
Joel made the audience laugh hard and cheer.
Brian sang: I Promise."

Subject	Another real letter from the real Fred
Body:	Hi, I'm Fred.

Matthew and I will go to Waco, Texas tonight: Oct 3, 2006.
We will visit the Beatnik Comedy Club.
Matthew has insisted that I get online.
I have been fearful of virus threats. I have spent and few hundred hours playing games away from the internet.
I must apply myself toward use the web in a constructive manner
instead of hiding in vivid fantasies.
Let's see how that goes.

Hey - I'm Quay . I work for heavy.com (do you know us?) and I'm wondering how I can persuade you to create an account on our myheavy.com site because you're really funny and you're exactly the kind of crazy/innovative/awesome video maker we want on our site. We're all smart dynamic creative video freaks here at heavy and we can smell our own kind.

Ps this is a pic of me with our trusty mannequin wearing the free stuff you'll get if you decide to join. I took it this morning. http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m50/quayar/DSCN1188.jpg

Let me know. you have nothing to lose and everything to gain (tshirts and all). ha."

"event","ok i know i probably shouldn't be saying this, especially on here, but i just have to get it off my chest... theres this guy and i'm like totally crushin on him!!! i mean hes not really all that attractive, but he puts off this cute vibe that i just can't resist. he has no idea that i like him, thank god!!! if he ever found out i would just completely die. but then again, what if something could happen? no, no scratch that, he'd never go for a girl like me."

"event","I think about your face
And how I fall into your eyes
The outline that I trace
Around the one that I call mine
Time that called for space
Unclear where you drew the line
I don't need to solve this case
And I don't need to look behind

Do I expect to change, the past I hold inside,
with all the words I say,
repeating over in my mind,
somethings you can't erase, no matter how hard you try,
an exit to escape is all there is left to find"

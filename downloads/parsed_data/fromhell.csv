"event","Harvey Glatman was a random/want-ad killer. As a child he enjoyed bondage, and would often hang himself in his attic and just before blacking out, he would have an orgasm. Doctor's ensured Glatman's parents that it was just a phase that he would grow out of. In 1945, he tried to make a girl undress by threatening her with a cap gun. He was picked up by police, but immediately fled to New York after being released on bail. He was imprisoned for Robbery while there. When released in 1951, he was still recieving psychiatric treatment. He eventually settled in Los Angeles and opened a small TV repairshop. He was pretty much a recluse, avoiding social contact with the opposite sex for six years. In late July 1957, Glatman made a house call to the home of nineteen year old Judy Dull, a model. He persuaded Judy to accept a modeling assignment, for fifty dollars. On August 1, Judy arrived at Glatman's home ready to model for the cover of a magazine. At gunpoint, Glatman raped Dull several times, then drove 125 miles east to Indio, where he photographed the woman in her underwear. He later strangled her with a rope and buried her in a shallow grave. Glatman found his second victim, Shirley Bridgeford, in March 1958. On their only date he drove her to the desert east of San Diego. He talked her into posing for a set of bondage photos for a detective magazine. He eventually choked her to death with a rope and left her to rot behind a cactus. He committed another murder on July 23, this time it was a part-time stripper named Ruth Mercado. Soon Glatman started placing ads of his own. He met a woman named Loraine Vigil. While in Glatman's car, he had pulled out his pistol and demanded for her to undress. When she refused, he shot her in the thigh. Then Ruth grabbed his pistol, holding him and his rope away until a cop on patrol drove by and noticed her situation. Glatman confessed quickly to his crimes. He was sentenced to die in a three day trial. He stated ""It's better this way.... I knew this is the way it would be."" In August 1959, Glatman died in San Quentin's gas chamber by breathing lethal fumes of cyanide."

"event","Some people regard her as ""<i>the first female serial killer in history</i>"" (which is not at all true) - a cold-blooded predator who stalked and murdered a string of victims over an extended period of time. Others (herself included) claim that she only killed in self-defense, when threatened with violence and rape. Whichever of these views is correct, one thing is certain. Between December 1989 and the following November, seven middle-aged male motorists, driving the highways of central Florida, stopped to pick up Aileen ""Lee"" Carol Wuornos and ended up dead.

Virtually from the day of her birth in 1956, her life was full of deprivation and violence, abandonment and abuse. She was the child of a teenage couple whose marriage had ended before she was born. Her father would eventually hang himself in jail after being arrested on child-molestation charges. One day when she was only six months old, her mother left the infant girl and her brother with a babysitter, then telephoned to say she wouldn't be coming home. Aileen was then taken in by her grandparents but kicked out of their house when she was 13 after giving birth to an illigitimate child (the consequence, she claimed, of rape). By the time she was 14, she was living a desperately brutalized life - sleeping in an abandoned car, hustling for drinks, drugs, and an occasional meal. At twenty, she married a 70 year old man, but their union lasted only a month (according to her account, he beat her with a cane; according to his, she beat him to get his car keys). At 22, she attempted suicide by shooting herself in the stomach. After recuperating, she robbed a convenience store at gunpoint, was promptly arrested, and spent 13 months in prison. Other arrests - for check forgery and auto theft - soon followed.

In 1986, she met the love of her life - a lesbian named Tyria Moore - at a Daytona gay bar. Even after their sexual passion cooled, the two remained inseparable for the next four years. During that time, Aileen's rage and resentment toward men grew increasingly violent. She continued to hustle. Now, however, she carried a .22-caliber gun in her handbag when she worked the truckstops and roadhouses.

On November 30, 1989, she took a ride with a 51 year old electronics repair shop owner named Richard Mallory. The next day, his car was found in a stretch of secluded woods, along with his wallet, a half-empty vodka bottle, and a torn package of condoms. Mallory's bullet-riddled corpse was uncovered in a junkyard 12 days later. Six more nearly identical killings followed.

After her and her lover were spotted driving one of the victim's cars, Florida police were able to pick up their trail. Aileen was arrested in a biker bar called The Last Resort. Once in custody, she confessed to all seven killings, though she claimed she was acting in self-defense. Tried for the murder of Richard Mallory, she insisted that she shot him after he choked and tortured her, raped her anally, and threatened to kill her. The jury was unpursuaded. She was convicted and sentenced to death by lethal injection. ""<i>I'm innocent,</i>"" she shouted when the verdict was read. ""<i>I hope you get raped! Scumbags of America!</i>""

Later, she recanted her claims, saying she wanted to make peace with God. ""<i>I'm one who seriously hates human life and would kill again,</i>"" she told the state Supreme Court.

Wuornos also claimed to have killed a seventh man. Her life story has also spawned two movies, several books and the opera ""Wournos,"" by Carla Lucero, which debuted last year.

Wuornos gave her last media interview Tuesday, October 8, 2002, to British producer Nick Broomfield, who did a documentary on her in 1993, but she stormed out after about 35 minutes. ""<i>My conclusion from the interview is, we are executing someone who is mad. Here is someone who has totally lost her mind,</i>"" Broomfield said.

Fort Lauderdale lawyer Raag Singhal wrote a letter to the state Supreme Court expressing ""grave doubts"" about Wuornos' mental condition. Gov. Jeb Bush issued a stay and ordered a mental exam, but lifted the stay in less than a month after three psychiatrists who interviewed her concluded that she understood why she was being executed. State Attorney John Tanner, who watched psychiatrists interview her for 30 minutes, said she was cognizant and lucid. ""<i>She knew exactly what she was doing,</i>"" Tanner said.

The state Supreme Court rejected two efforts to stop her execution, one from a private attorney in Tampa who expressed ""<i>serious concerns</i>"" about Wuornos' competency, the other from an Ohio group that wanted to file an appeal on Wuornos' behalf.

Billy Nolas, who represented Wuornos in her 1992 trial in Daytona Beach, said she suffered from borderline personality disorder as a result of neglect and sexual abuse as a child. He said she  was ""<i>the most disturbed individual I have represented.</i>""

Aileen, 46, was executed Wednesday, October 9, 2002. She was pronounced dead from lethal injection at 9:47 a.m. in Florida State Prison. More than a 10 years after she murdered six men along central Florida highways."

"event","Joe Ball, born in the 1890's, was the owner of a tavern in Elmendorf, Texas called the Sociable Inn. Some of it's distinguishing features were pretty waitresses, and a pit of alligators in the back, that the visitors would enjoy watching get fed. Ball had a hard time keeping waitresses at his tavern, but none the less, it was still a very busy place. Not everyone liked Joe. One neighbor complained about the smell coming from the gator pit, and Joe threatened him with a pistol for it. In September 1937 relatives reported Minnie Gotthardt missing. The 22 year old woman had been a waitress at Ball's tavern. Ball claimed she left to go to another job. Then another waitress, Julia Turner, was reported missing. Still, Ball claimed she too had left for another job. The only thing was, Turner hadn't taken her clothes with her. Balls' story: Turner got into an argument with her roommate, she was anxious to leave, he gave her $500.00 for the trip. Soon, two more women were reported missing. One of the missing women had opened a bank account a few days earlier, and disappeared without taking the money with her. Rangers compiled a list of all of Ball's employees. Many were found alive, and more than twelve were reported missing, so was two of Joe's wives. Ball's handyman eventually cracked under pressure and admitted to helping Ball dispose of many female bodies by feeding them to the alligators. On September 24, 1938, the Rangers had enough evidence to convict Ball, so they stopped into the Sociable Inn. Ball, stepped behind the counter, rang up a ""No Sale"" on the register, removed a pistol from the drawer and shot himself dead. His handyman was jailed for a few years for being an accessory, and the alligators were donated to the San Antonio zoo."

"event","A native Mexican, born in 1934, Corona moved to Yuba City, California in the early 50's. He stayed there, and established a family, moving from being a picker in the fields to a labor contractor. He was known to many ranchers supplying cres on demand. In 1970, a young Mexican's scalp was laid open by a machete, in the cafe run by Corona's gay brother, Natividad. The victim pressed charges against Natividad, trying to get $250,000.00 in damages. Natividad fled to Mexico, and the case was left unsolved. Nobody had linked Juan to the crime. On May 19, 1971, a Japanese farmer was touring his orchard and came upon a freshly dug hole, about the size of a grave, in between two fruit trees. One of Corona's crews was working nearby so the farmer shrugged it off until later that night when he returned and found the hole filled in. He called the police in to the site the next morning, a bit of digging revealed the fresh corpse of Kenneth Whitacre. The guy had been stabbed, and his skull torn open with blows from something sharp. Four days later, workers reported finding a second grave. The corpse of Charles Fleming was found in it, before they had him identified, they had found the next burial site, and the next. In nine days of discovering bodies from the orchard, totaling 25, the search was terminated. In one grave, deputies found two receipts dated May 21, and signed Juan V. Corona. On June 4, another bodie would be discovered with two receipts with the same signature. Most of the victims were stabbed or hacked to death, with many signs of homosexuality being involved. Most of the victims were migrant workers, drifters, and alcoholics. None had been reported missing. The receipts placed Juan at the scene of the crime, and he was taken to trial. The defense tried to place the blame on Natividad, a known violent homosexual. The jury deliberated for 45 hours, before convicting Juan on all counts. He was sentenced to 25 consecutive terms of life imprisonment. While in prison, Corona lost his eye in a stabbing. Currently Juan resides at Corcoran State Prison, in California."

"event","Frank Spisak was known to his neighbors on the east side of Cleveland as ""Frankie Ann Spisak,"" a transvestite who looked forward to a possible sex change operation. When not in drag, Frank worshipped Adolf Hitler. Eventually he stopped wearing gowns and high heels and started immatating his idol, going as far as growing a toothbrush mustache and slicking his hair down in a Hitler fashion. In February 1982, Spisak started a series of ""<i>search-and-destroy missions</i>"" to ""</i>clean-up</i>"" the city. He invaded the campus of Cleveland State University, shooting a black minister to death in the men's room. Four months later he wounded another black man. And in August, he started a full-scale rampage. By the end of the month he had killed 50 year old Timothy Sheehan, the assistant superintendent of the buildings and grounds at CSU, and 17 year old Brian Walford, killed near the campus. A third attack failed when he missed a CSU employee. Both, the employee and Sheehan, were white, but Spisak had thought they were Jews. In September 1982 he was arrested for firing a gun out his apartment window, and released on bail before an anonymous caller advised police to re-examine his .22 caliber gun. Test bullets matched the slugs retrieved from one of the murders. Spisak later confessed to other murders, claiming ""<i>my aim was pretty good</i>."" Pleading insanity at his trial in August 1983, Spisak declared taht his war had been launched under orders from God, his ""<i>immediate superior</i>."" Jews were to blame for his earlier transvestite episodes, having ""<i>seized control of his mind.</i>"" When asked how his brain was now working he replied ""<i>never better</i>."" The Judge asked jurors to disregard Spisak's plea for insanity for lack of evidence. After five hours of deliberation, he was sentenced to death. Frank addressed the court with deviance. ""<i>Even though this court may pronounce me guilty a thousand times, the higher court of our great Aryan warrior God pronounces me innocent. Heil Hitler!</i>"" Spisak is currently still in prison in Ohio."

"event","Around the same time Edmund Kemper was killing, a second serial killer roamed the area. But Herbert Mullin had a motive far different than that of any other serial killer of that time. In Mullin's view, his murders were the only way to prevent another earthquake from destroying California. Mullin, born on April 18, 1947 (the 41st anniversary of the San Fransico earthquake of 1906) in Salinas, California. By the time he was in his twenties, he had became a moody, hostile dabbler in Eastern religions and illegal drugs. He was prone to violent outbursts. In 1969 he began immatating every movement of his brother-in-law, which terrified his parents. This behavior was known as echopraxia, and it was a strong symptom of schizophrenia. The day after he began mimicing his brother-in-law, Mullin checked into a mental hospital, where he was diagnosed as a schitzophrenic. He checked out six weeks later. By October of that year he had re-admitted himself to another mental institute, only to be re-released weeks later. In 1972, a 24 year old Mullin arrived in Santa Cruz to visit his parents. Soon, he began recieving telepathic messages from his father saying ""<i>Herb, I want you to kill me somebody.</i>"" On the 13th of October, he did just that. He clubbed an old man to death on a road in the Santa Cruz mountains. A few weeks later he stabbed a young female hitchhiker to death and left her body in the hills. On November 2, All Soulds Day, Mullin stabbed a Roman Catholic priest to death in his confessional. Around this time, he believed he'd been chosen by Albert Einstein as the ""<i>designated leader</i>"" of his generation, and his voices had changed; now they belonged to his victims, giving their permission to be killed. In January of 1973, Mullin killed 5 more to prevent the disaster from occuring. In early February, he found a tent with four teenage campers inside. He told them to leave, then shot them, and left them dead where they fell. On February 13, while loading firewood into his car, Mullin heard the voices yet again. He then drove through Santa Cruz, shot an old man, then left. Witnesses gave a description of the car, and police had him captured within minutes. He accepted his arrest. During his trial Mullin gave rambling discussions of his earthquake theory, and a rationale of his crimes: ""<i>A rock doesn't make a decision while it's falling, it just falls.</i>"" The jury decided that he was sane, and found him guilty on 10 counts of murder. He currently resides at Mule Creek State Prison in California."

"event","Penny Bjorkland was a normal teenager. Just like anyone you'd find in any small town in the United States. Blonde hair, blue eyes, freckles, and a pony-tail. She even considered herself a ""<i>normal, average girl</i>."" Her friends in school noticed she was really nervous, a nail biter, and a bit of a loner. Once in school she was caught with a container of Vodka and orange juice in her locker. Although on February 2, 1959 police discovered the turnout of her minds workings. On that day the body of August Norry was found in the Daly City hills, south of San Francisco. Norry was a twenty-eight year old landscaper, married, and about to become a father for the first time. He was known as a lady's man, but that wasn't much of a lead to figure out why someone had fired eighteen bullets into him. Their best lead was a testimony of a boy who had seen a freckle-faced blonde driving Norry's car like mad away from the hills, and the .38 caliber bullets. After two months of investigating the police found the ""<i>freckle-faced blonde</i>"" by tracing the bullets. They were made by a real distinctive mold, the man that made them remembered selling them to Bjorkland. The police picked her up at her parent's Daly City home. Her confession the next morning answered a lot of questions. She had stolen the .38 from a friend's bedroom sometime in January. On Sunday, February 1 she left home with the army-issue handgun tucked into the waistband of her pedal pushers, but didn't know what she was going to do. But soon she realized what she wanted to do when August Norry picked her up and offered her a ride. When she got out of the car, she faced Norry and fired five shots into him. Going around the car, she took out fresh ammo and reloaded. When she got to the drivers side, she fired five more shots into Norry. Still unfinished she went back to the passengers side of the car and shot him more. Then took the body out of the car, and drove off. When the police asked her about motive she replied ""<i>For about a year or a year and a half I've had the urge to kill someone</i>,"" she said, a bit embarrased. ""<i>I'll admit that the motive sounds crazy, but I wanted to know if a person could commit a crime like this and not worry about the police looking for her or have it on her conscience</i>."" And in the end she stated ""<i>I've felt better since I killed him.</i>"" At her trial the reporters described her as having a ""<i>giggling disinterest</i>."" Up until the judge read her verdict: life imprisonment. She was stunned, and stated that ""<i>I am unhappy.</i>"""

"event","In his first 23 years, John Linley Fraizer was a fairly normal guy. Like Charles Manson, Fraizer was driven by apocalyptic visions. Unlike Manson, who had an irregular childhood, Fraziers life was regular. He dropped out of high school, and took a trade as an auto mechanic in Santa Cruz, California. His wife described him as a beautiful person. Sometime in the spring of 1970, Fraizer started taking drugs, and his marriage broke up. He started living the life of the counterculture, and took up an interest in Ecology. Even quitting his mechanic job, telling his boss he refused to ""<i>contribute to the death cycle of the planet.</i>"" After this, he took off to join the hippie communes. He soon became interested in the mystical meaning of the tarot cards. He didn't fit in too well with his new hippie friends. He was fiercely paranoid, which didn't fit with the laid back lifestyle of the hippies he was with. Soon he drifted away from the communes and started his own self-styled lifestyle of an Aquarian Age Hermit, living in a six-foot-square shack in the woods. Not far away was the home of an eye surgeon named Victor Ohta. Once while the Ohta family was out, Fraizer broke into their house and stole a pair of binoculars. He considered the Ohta's to be ""<i>too materialistic.</i>"" On Monday, October 19, 1970, Fraizer went back to the Ohta house. Victors wife, Virginia, was the only person home. Holding a .38 revolver on the woman, he tied her wrists with a scarf, then waited for the rest of the family to come home. Soon, Dorothy Cadwallader, Victors secretary, showed up, along with one of the two Ohta boys. Then Ohta returned home with their second son. As each showed up, they were tied at gunpoint. Standing outside by the pool, Fraizer started to lecture the captives about the evils of materialistic society and the ways in which it destroyed the environment. Ohta got into an argument with Fraizer, so he shoved him into the pool. While he was trying to get out of the water, Fraizer shot him 3 times. One by one Fraizer killed the rest. Virginia, then Dorothy, then the boys, Derrick, and Taggart. Then Frazier went into the house, typed a note, and set the house a blaze. When the fire fighters showed up they found the five bodies in the pool, and the typed note under the windshield wipers of Ohta's Rolls-Royce. The message said:

<i>halloween...1970
today world war 3 will begin as brought to you by the pepole of the free universe.
From this day forward anyone and?/or company of persons who missuses the natural environment or destroys same will suffer the penelty of death by the people of the free universe.
I and my comrads from this day forth will fight until death or freedom, against anything or anyone who dose not support natural life on this planet, materialisum must die, or man-kind will.
KNIGHT OF WANDS
KNIGHT OF CUPS
KNIGHT OF PENTICLES
KNIGHT OF SWORDS</i>

The community was in fear. The Tate/LaBianca murders by the Manson Family had occurred a bit over a year before, and now they were expecting the same to happen again. The hippie communes became suspicious. The police learned though, that the communes were also spooked by the Ohta murders, and they were willing to cooperate in catching the killer. Soon the note was published by the press, and a group of hippies recognized the ideas of the note of those that John Linley Fraizer would talk about, and they supplied the location to Fraizers shack to the police. Fraizer's fingerprints were lifted from the Rolls-Royce, and a can of beer found at the scene. When convicted in November 1970, a sanity trial was followed to determine what sort of punishment Fraizer should receive. Fraizers courtroom theatrics were unheard of. One side of his head was completely shaved, while his long hair and beard still sprouted on the other side. His reason for this stunt was quite convoluted. He appeared to be putting on an act to win an insanity plea, but his psychologist thought otherwise. He said that Fraizer was trying to appear to be faking insanity, so that the jury would feel obliged to dismiss the insanity argument. In the end Fraizer got a sanity ruling, and a death sentence. He regarded the gas chamber as preferable to ""<i>having any fascist pigs working on my head.</i>"" Fraziers wish was denied when the California Supreme Court abolished capital punishment, and commuted his sentence to life imprisonment. He's still serving his sentence at San Quentin Prison."

"event","Arthur Shawcross recieved a second chance at life after being released back into the community for the murder of two small children. Moving from place to place he ended up in Rochester, New York. He married Rose Walley while in Rochester. He also met Clara Neal, who became his mistress. Working nights as a food wholesaler, and living near the center of town, he didn't even have a car. During the day he would be seen riding a brown Schwinn bicycle, a womans model, to fishing spots along the Genesee River. Not many people wanted Arthur for a neighbor. In 1972 while in Watertown, New York, an upstate town, Shawcross had murdered little ten year old Jack Blake, and eight year old Karen Hill. He served 15 years of a 25 year sentence for these crimes. He was released on parole in April of 1987 for those murders. After moving from town to town, chased out by enraged citizens, he found his home in Rochester. People there found him to be friendly, and mild mannered. They didn't know of his dark past. In March of 1988 the body of a 27 year old prostitute was found floating in Salmon Creek. In September another body was found. Over a year later in October of 1989, a third was found, and in early November, a fourth. Later that month a fifth. Police believed the murders were too similar to be the work of different people...a serial killer was loose in the community. Arthur followed the news of the murders closely. He warned his wife and Clara to be careful. He also hung out at the local Dunkin' Donuts to talk with the cops about the case. In late November another body was found by a guy walking his dog. Four days later another body was found. By the end of the year three more body's were added to the death list. About this time, the Rochester police invited FBI serial killer specialists in to help. They made a profile of the killer: White male, thirties, mobile, trusted by the women who fearlessly got into his car. On January 3, 1990 state troopers in a helicopter spotted a body in the icy Salmon Creek waters. On a bridge overlooking the creek a man leaned out of his car urinating into a pop bottle. The choper alerted some patrol cars and they surrounded the area. Shawcross had just finished a salad when he saw the copter. He climbed back into Clara Neal's Chevy and left toward the nursing home where she worked. As soon as he pulled in, a police car pulled in behind him and he was taken in for questioning. Shawcross didn't fit the profile to well, but when they checked his history their interests changed. They impounded the Chevy, and let Arthur go for lack of evidence. While inspecting the Chevy they found a pink earring that matched one of the earrings found on one of the victims. Shawcross was picked up the next morning. For hours he denied involvement in the crimes. Eventually he confessed to the murders in detail. He had strangled one of his victims for calling him ""<i>no better than a faggot</i>""...and saying that he was the Genesee River Killer. He smashed one's face into the car door for saying he was ""<i>hopeless</i>"", and killed one for claiming to be a virgin. By the time his October trial came he had refused to testify. His defence tried to get a insanity claim. Under hypnosis he spoke as an eleven year old arttie, and even as a reincarnated medieval English cannibal. A few of the prostitutes he killed had had their vaginas cut out, which Arthur had ate a few of. He was sentenced to 10 consecutive terms of 25 years at the Sullivan Correctional Facility. He was convicted of 10 murders, but later admitted to an eleventh. He is still being held at Sullivan with no possibility of parole."

"event","Ricky Kasso was from Northport Long Island. In 1984 the police of Northport received a phone call about a body in a shallow grave in Aztakea Woods. There, in the woods, the police found the body of Gary Lauwers, over two weeks decomposed. The man had been stabbed thirty two times, twenty-two in the face. The total may have been higher, but the decomposition made it impossible to tell. The police focused their investigation on Ricky Kasso and James Troiano. Both were high school dropouts, and known drug abusers who lived on the streets. Troiano had a record of burglary arrests, but Kasso had more unusual charges. His most recent arrest was a charge of grave robbing, where he dug up a 19th century grave from which he stole a skull and hand that he intended to use for a satanic rite. Soon after they were taken into custody, they both confessed to the murder. They were linked to a local satanic group known as the Knights of the Black Circle, which had around twenty members and was known for animal sacrifices. As part of a satanic rite, Kasso gouged out Lauwers eyes. Kasso may have been able to help more with the investigation, but on July 7th, he hung himself in his jail cell. When Troiano went on trial for second degree murder at the beginning of the next year the case had been revised. The Knights of the Black Circle had nothing to do with this murder. There had been only one witness to the murder besides Troiano, Albert Quinones. Satanism wasn't much involved in the murder, even though they knew Kasso was into a heavy metal style of satanism, but drugs were the main factor in the murder. The act that triggered the murder was Lauwers stealing ten bags of Angel Dust from Kasso. Kasso spent two months complaining about the rip-off, then on June 16th he decided to teach Lauwers a lesson. Lauwers was in the woods with Kasso, Quinones, and Troiano tripping on Mescaline. Kasso started harassing him about it, then started beating him, soon he was out of control and got out his pocket knife. Kasso stabbed him over and over again screaming ""<i>Say you love Satan!!!</i>"". Lauwers response was ""<i>No, I love my mother!</i>"". He accidentally cut out the eyes while he stabbed him over and over again. He eventually left the body in the woods covered with leaves. In Kasso's confession, he said he heard the screech of a crow, which, in his mind, was Satan saying that the murder was a good thing. At the trial of Troiano, he maintained that he was only a witness, and didn't participate in the murder. The jury found him not guilty.

"event","Pedro Lopez was born in 1949 to a prostitute. He was one of 13 children. At the age of eight, he sexually molested one of his sisters, and as a punishment for this his mother kicked him into the streets. He was molested at that age by another man in a neighboring town. He was assaulted again when he was eighteen while in prison for car theft. He was gang raped by four older convicts, and this led to his first murder conviction when he killed three of the four attackers. He received a two year sentence for that. His term only made him want to kill more. Usually, he'd wander through the market till he found a girl that he could take to a isolated spot. First he would rape, then second he would strangle the girl. In 1978 he is said to have killed a hundred girls from Peru. In a Indian village he was caught trying to take a nine-year-old girl. The Ayachucos' Indians that caught him considered justice to be a beating then torturing, then burying him alive. But before they could do this an American missionary talked them into letting her take him to the authorities. The authorities took Lopez to Ecuador instead of punishing him for the crime. He killed and raped possibly 110 Ecuador girls. In 1980, he was caught leading away a twelve-year-old girl. This came after the unearthing of fifty-three victims. He took them to many other burial sites, but no other bodies were found. They think that Lopez led them on a wild goose chase on the other searches. Lopez is still in prison in Ecuador, and may get a chance for parole. However, if released he still has trials and prison time coming to him in Colombia and Peru."

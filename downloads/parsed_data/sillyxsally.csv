"event","Being someone your not get's you somewhere only in your mind. 
Being someone your not get's you no desire for what you in sight. 

Im done. THis is me. The boy who wants love, the boy with insecurity.

Confidence get's me no where but pierced veins.
Trying to act like the cool guy get's me bored and literally fucking insane.
I hate it.
The one fucking thing I alway's truelly wantt, is what i suffer for. 
(usually what everyone suffer's for)
I'm on the verge of being content for the best, but fuck it.  
It failed me. Again. 

So many fucking people.

''OOOOOO you have no idea what the hell is going on in my mind right now!! OOO!!''
 THat's just a fucking example of pathetic girls with there skank ass livejournals.
 

FUck them. 
They can go help themselves now, those fucking sluts. '
I can't change them, only they can. 
All ive been doing is throwing myself at girls, trying to help them. 
Seeing there insides, seeing there mentalities. 
Especially this one particullar girl, she mixes my emotions like a fucking blender.
And with her thinking im ''MR. Know it all'' and shit. 
She cant even think straight to realize, im there for the better.
I'm there for smiles, Laughs, rap lines and talks for long whiles.

I get things so fucking easily it's absolutely disgusting. 
Never somehting to work for. 
To look forward to. 
I wish i were a bum sometimes out on the street running for money.
Atleast it's something worth going for. 
I dont know what to go for. 
I'm scared man. 

What i hate maybe higher than a loves passion is when all of us people say

'' no one understands me!! bla bla!!'' 

FUck you, don't blame it on us. Blame it on yourselves.
It's you who doesnt know yourself. 
And anyways that alone is'nt true because you know yourself better than anything.

I'm really not the poet so go finish these lame ass insecure words yourself."

"event","Music....is a flow.

A thing that bursts into grains, as we grow.

becuase it's everywhere. 

Not only singles or groups of people make it, nor they say it.

You always wonder why yoou feel the way you do when you sit outside on the curb

or maybe sitting inside with the fire place where your tears can never be heard...

Sounds of music are temperature of temptations, there no different than your senses 

You hear, then touch, then feel, now tasting the noise as smell becomes the adrenaline.

The wind will hit and blow the tree's for  a reason. 

It makes the sound, that air is what we live in. 

Most of us here are fragile in our heart's.

It's because  music is being played through the reality that will never break apart.


It helps us decide, dictate, decieve and precieve as if it were a life long cell.

(Cell as in, You, I, everyone alive)

I could go for hours and experiences wihtout music, becuase i know it so well.

Trick part is, it's not like that happens because music loves me more than i seem to know.

If it's helped me as much as it has, then i dont know why im still here even breathing.

because feeding from notes and noise is my only apitite these days.

It's made me think of things like my succinct theory.....as for my conclusion


 Noise creates help."

Weathers, Travis
Period 3 Felcher.
 
Everyone alway's thought that Mr. Clef was a little cooped-up. He was the vocal teacher in the music department at Sinderlane Hills Highschool. This is my first year as a freshman at Sinderlane. My passion was to sing. I promised myself that ever since I was little, and if I died before I got there then I'd sing for my murderer or disease right before I passed. Let;s not wory though. Just my  non-sense thought's shouting out.
First day of school was quite odd...... I met Mr. Clef and he was sorta strange, but nothing to jump away from or scream on sight at. I noticed his words would flow, almost as if it were a poem. He some sort of poetic speech. When I said Julia Monte, when he called out for names in class, he slowly looked up at me with a humble grin as I appealed to him or something. Through the year, he was a great teacher. Teaching us great songs and jingles. Though I noticed I was worked the hardest and alway's got the lead. I never acted like a teacher's pet or too keen. I wasnt any better than the other girls. After all, this is a woman's Choir. Mr. Clef as classy as he was would read us his short poetic-short storys before warm up. He really wasn't as bad people made him out to be. He was a little strange, but interesting is better then boring right? After a while I really trusted the guy. I had stayed after school sometimes to help myself get better and to have him guide me through. More then any other of my teachers he was my favorite. I felt like I knew his insides. I shouldnt feel that about a teacher, but he's a person like you or me right? One day after school, I had to wait outside. During an immense snow storm. It was afful. I had been waiting for my dad there all afternoon. Then it had becoming almost dark. As I was waitng on the corner I saw Mr. Clef pulling out of the Faculty Parking Lot. I quickly had an idea and ran over there as fast as I could with the wind putting weights on my body pulling me back. As I knocked on his car window, I exaustingly was asking for a ride home. He wasn't really sure about that idea, but finally he put on a slight gring and said ok. only if he could go home first he said. It was so cold and icey outside i didn't even bother to ask why. I just got into the car. He opened the passenger seat door. Got in. Didnt even look back.........

...........................................................................................

Julia Monte and Don Clef have been missing for 3 days the officer says sitting on his chair putting the coffe on his desk. While Mr. Monte and Mr.s Monte sitting in his office, a cop busts through the door with a letter and a face that looked like something scared him litteraly as they would say ''Shit-Less.'' The Monte's askedthe officer what had happend and he said '' Well, we found your daughter....'' They were so relieved to hear something so great. THey didnt't bother to even ask how she was. They assumed to far to think that she was ok. The officer still with his dirty face, handed them the note had walked in with. They both opened it up. They began to read it. They didnt know what they were reading until it hit finally hit them.


Sing it now!
Sing it Proud!
I hear minor 6th's and 7th's singing out loud.
THe bitch is fucking singing for me.
WOW, Iv'e never seen such a power behind a voice.
Maybe when all litte girls are gutted in the shower,
They'd make this exact same noise..........

Sincerlely Mr. Clef


Mr. Clef had disapeared forever..................never to be seen again.
He had never commited an act of murder before. This proves that trusting someone can lead to anything.
This just shows that the only person you can trust is yourself.

HAPPY HOLLOWEEN TRUSTERS."

So my fellow peers and I are talking about the wonderfull pasts about our young childhood days of DOUG! YES DOUG!! So were talking about each character we could remember. When we start talking about SKEETER, we are like yeh wasnt he the black one? In the show i mean. And Rob points it out!! A 17 old guy and he goes NO SKEETER WAS ITALIAN. By this time im going wtf? HE points out to all of us that on a Christmas special episode Skeeter is having a CHRISTAIN DINNER AND HE'S EATING CLAMS!!!!!  yes, Rob was right... Skeeter Italian, the world would have never known.         


 Now, ok when we were all kids in about 1st and 2nd grade we all liked Power Rangers. Well most of us. (I was the red ranger 3 times in a row for holloween). Anyways, as I was elequently saying.  Sooooooo, I have come to a conclusion  alll the power ranger symbols are pretty racist.


THINK ABOUT IT~!!!!!    

1. Jason- The Nazzi- He's white Trash,his color is red, and he's the T REX that fucks everyone up. (get me?)
2. Billy-He's the smart one-His name fucken belongs in a college text book and he's fucking jewish!! Ok his animal is a Rino/Dinosoar(i cant speel it) And Rhino's have BIG ASS NOSES. You know where im getting at.
3. TRiny-The asain-Yeh she's asain......there wasnt much to say about her but isnt that true about all asainS????? O and her Dinosoar is a fucking Yellow Tiger. KUNG FOO HIIYAAAAa
4.Kimberley-She was the fucken Pink valley girl- And she's a Teradactal(I cant spell). She fly's like a bird.......COO COO!!!!
5. The worst of them all.....................- Zack-His skin matches his color- Ya he's black alright. And of course they give him the Elephant Dinosar. Because elephants come from where!? That's right Africa ladys and gentlemen. hahah He had a flat top

6........Remember TOMMY! Of course he was Hispanic at first when he came into the show. He was green from then. Like a Chili Pepper. Jesus Christ, then when he goes to college his suit turns white.........what the fuck is that all about???!?!?!?!!? COLLEGE?WHITE?>

9. After we eat are Happy meals or Double Double's, we walk around on the sidewalk on the traffic streets of Ventura Blvd.

10. After we share our Coldstone Icecream, We sneak inside an apartment building and go the roof. There we listen and stare at the cities glowing of Sherman Oaks. Stars are an option too.

11. With her cute ass black jacket on, She takes her smile and eyeys away form the sky and gives them to me.

12. I type out my face expression in my head. I press the enter key. I replied.

13. My reply had a nervous,happy,locked eye,confused,heartbeating adrenaline and BA RA HSS ADLFKJADLJ AOIEJRLAEWKJRLEKR LDSAKRJSLERJ AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.............woah.......before I could could even think of these thoughts. She was already was kissing me. Once theses thoughts came to me it only made me kiss heavier with ''Heart beating Breath''.

 I think the only thing in my body that's not parrelized is my mouth and thoughts. 

  Because im locked.

14.  She had the key and opened me up. She says it's time for her to go home. So we did everything we did to sneak onto roof (except backwords).

15. After are trek to her house, it's way too late for her to walk through the door. So she sighs.... and Takes! my hand! and sneaks me in the house with her. She asked for a Slumber Party.    I said ok, with an unsure feeling. After we watched Adam's (levin) Aunt's movie, ''The Evil Dead''. Random, but sooo awsome. We went to bed...... I was on the floor and she was on the bed.            .......

About 5 minutes later, She's laying next to me on the floor. I got to keep my pillow tonight, because i was hers .......(pillow that is). 




...................................................................................

I found something inside me. It kinda said hello. It's name was passion. At first I've never met something like it. As i got to know it personally, I noticed that it was just me all along. Just my second conscience wacking my brain to tell me that I need someone to spill my organs out to so they can help me with my problems. Instead of having me helping myself out, every single time. Maybe once im cured we can take those organs i dropped, make the instrument out of it.......and play some Goldon Oldies on it. I dont know, sounds like fun to me. It could happen right? Patients Travis, everyone gets a chance.......I think."

And at the end of the night I'll ask the waiter to bring my lady a glass of water with a cherry in it as she's in the bathroom thinking if it's the right decision to be with me.....then when she get's back to the table, she sit's down nervously and see's that the waiter brings her the water. Immediately she smiles...........I take her hands.....and we start playing with eachother's feet.       .........no one to show off my passion to, so who's gonna ever know? IM not that bad, can someone feed off of me? I can only survive if i do the same.

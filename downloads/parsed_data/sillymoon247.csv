"event","Yesterday I was with Anthony when i got a call about 8:15 telling me the tragic news that Rosie Jones a loved basketball player at our school, the nicest kid you'll ever meet, had passed away.  I could not believe the words that were coming out of my friend paul's mouth! It was shocking and it seemed like it wasnt really happening, but unfortunately it was.  Rosie you will be missed by all your friends, family, and fans! You will NEVER be forgotten....watch over us with God in heaven!

On a different note! It was my dad's birthday today! 47 yrs old now! We went out to Red Lobster to celebrate and then came home and he opened his gifts! It was nice to get to spend time with my dad because we never really get to spend time together with both of our busy schedules! I also went tanning today and ran some errands to put up some new posters and such in my room! I then cleaned my room for about 2 hours and ended up cleaning out my closet! 

I FOUND MY HOMECOMING HAIRSTYLE! its sooo awesome and full of curls! I'm so excited to go to homecoming with Anthony! he's so amazing and sweet! I also got my Chipotle Ambassador stuff in the mail today! it was the sweetest shirt i've ever seen and i'm wearing it tomorrow! but i'm going to bed!

G'nite!"

"event","Hello everyone! i kno i haven't written in 2 months but i am finally back! haha!  These past 3 weeks have been amazing with Anthony! He's the greatest guy i've ever met and this feels soooo right.  I haven't been asked to Homecoming yet (hint hint) lol.  Yesterday i helped my sister's friend LA ask her to Homecoming by decorating her room with balloons and streamers and connecting it to the theme of Wild Wild West with a wanted poster and a cowboy hat! She said yes and im really excited for her! 

The game on friday was HORRIBLE! it was our little girls cheer clinic and our *SENIOR NIGHT* and it was raining and we were drenched. Stupid Barb Barrows let the poms and the marching band go home but she didnt let the cheerleaders go home so we were all soaking wet and cold! It sucked!  Last night i had work from 5-8 and then i went over to Anthonys! I was so excited to hang out with him because we dont really get to hang out during the week and its so awesome being with him because he's definitely AMAZING! LOVE YOU! We watched ""Meet the Parents"" and had Oreo Snowdrifts from Caribou and just hung out and talked! it was so awesome! Anthony you are the best!

Today's Agenda:
~ Work 11-2
~ Grandmas house for dinner
~ Homework
~ Maybe some Anthony?!?!
~ Bedtime! School tomorrow! yuck!"

"event","What a boring day....i woke up around 10 and intended to clean my room but ended up watching Friends season 3 on DVD instead lol. Then my sister and I went to Jewel because there was nothing to eat in the house and we bought:
*Mac N Cheese
*Cake Mix and Frosting
*Bread
*Koolaid
*Mini Pizzas
And when we got home we baked my fav kind of cake *Funfetti* which tasted amazing by the way... then we watched Pochahontas cuz we had nothing better to do! I then cleaned my room and went to Little Caesars to pick up a pizza and crazy bread for dinner.  After that i took a nap until 8:30 and then my mom got home from being in Reno, Nevada for 5 days! 

I have to work this whole week.... everyday @ 11 til about 1:30 or so and then on Friday i work at double and am back on at 5! Then saturday i leave for Michigan hopefully with susan...for 4 days! Be back on tuesday!

Therefore today i did absolutely nothing until 5:00 when i had to be at work (which by the way sucked a big one!) My manager is the gayest person in the world and i want to throw a brick at his face lol.  Then i stayed after i got cut at 10:40 and ate with my friend stacey and ryan....food never tasted so good! haha! Considering i havent hosted in awhile my whole lower body is killing me!!

"event","Yesterday was indeed a good day! This is what i did yesterday:

* Work
* Jamie's House 
* Cheer 5-7
* Shower and Dinner
* Hung out with Mike and Jamie @ Mike's House
* Pearl Harbor

Overall it was a good day! Work was busy which means good tips...Jamie's house is always a good time...Cheer we gave speeches for Captains and i think that went ok...im anxious to see the results!  Dinner was excellent, we had steak and potatoes! Hanging out with Mike and Jamie was alot of fun! We played pinball and i def beat them the first game but the second game was a different story...then they had to leave for Spiderman 2 so i went home and watched my favorite movie Pearl Harbor...all in all a good time!

Today's Schedule:

* Pick up my sis from Maddie's house
* Hang out with Ariel 
* Pick up my tip share at work so i have money for the weekend
* Go to see Jamie for the last time before he leaves for 2 weeks :(
* Cheer 5-7
* Leave for Michigan until Monday Morning

I'm disappointed that Jamie is working until 4:30 today because i really wish that i could see him more than like 15 min b4 practice because i'm gonna miss him so much while he's in NC...but i guess you'll have that.  I'm gonna be busy the next two weeks anyway between Michigan and Cheer Camp so hopefully it'll go by fast! I guess when you think about it it is only two weeks...not the end of the world....

PS: I'm really excited to hang out with Mike these next few weeks!!! I love him to death and he is nothing short of AMAZING! haha! We're gonna have so much fun!"

"event","So i started the day with waking up late to go to work and then worked until 2:00 and only made $3 in tips so that wasnt the best time. Tomorrow i have to go to work too except i'll prolly be there longer considering i'm hostessing tomorrow! yuck! So then i came home and got ready to go to practice...

Practice was really uneventful today...most of the time we spent trying to figure out uniforms which i got the one i wanted mostly because of Senior Priority! yay! I'm kind of nervous for tomorrow's practice tho because we're giving speeches for Captains and thursday is the vote...i really hope i get it...i wont be there thursday to find out tho! I also threw my full again today and didn't kill myself this time which was good! 

After practice i played tennis with Ryan and definetly lost 3-6 which was embarrassing because he wasnt even playing with his own racket but was playing with mine!! o well its ok i'll win next time..it was my first time playin in 3 months! 

Then ...Jamie came over!!! I was so happy to see him! He always knows how to make my day and never fails to make me smile!  We just hung out at my house while my kitten kept biting and clawing at our feet! I didn't want him to leave but unfortunately he had no choice...i really like him and I think this is going to work out! i have a good feeling about this one! We're so alike its kinda scary! I dont know what i'm gonna do without him when he goes to North Carolina until the 15th and prolly cant bring his phone! But it'll make it all the better for when i see him again.....Jamie you truly make my life amazing!

PS: Mike Nelson is my hero and I love him to death! Mike i'm gonna make you go to six flags with me!"

"event","Work was really gay today...i was hosting by myself for 2 1/2 hours and we got hit kinda hard which = me bussing tables, answering the door, and collecting menus all at once nonstop! But then after work i came home and definitely took a two hour nap! ahh it felt so good! Then Jamie stopped by for a few...he couldn't hang out tonite cuz it was his dad's birthday but it was sooo good to see him!  

I think i may really be falling for him...I really hope that something good comes out of this because rite now everytime i see him im soooo happy! He makes me laugh and smile and i love life with him! Overall today was a good day...but anyday with Jamie usually is...

I heart you."

"event","So last nite may have been the most fun i've had in a really long time....started out the evening with Jamie, Ariel, and Mike hanging out at my house and then we went to Caribou and Oberweis. Unfortunately Jamie had to go home and Mike had to go pick up his brother so Ariel and I stayed out ALL nite and went to... ZERO GRAVITY! haha it was so much fun...we went crazy and danced all nite long! We finally left at about 2am and decided to go to Jewel for food and then we spent the nite at Mike's house where we did not go to bed until 5am...

i really wish Jamie could've been there with me...he stopped by today and i was really excited to see him! We're hopefully hanging out tomorrow and then he is going on vacation for 2 weeks on friday! i dont kno what i'm gonna do while he's gone...ill miss him too much! lol!"

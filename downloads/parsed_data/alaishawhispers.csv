"event","<P>This is my first tutorial, so go easy on me!&nbsp; Feedback is always welcome, especially critisicm (sp?).&nbsp; I love to know what I'm doing wrong!&nbsp; Also, if you use this tutorial, show me the results!&nbsp; I'd love to see if my tutorial works!&nbsp; I use PSP7, but I'm pretty sure that this would be easily translated into PSP8 or PS7, although I'm not positive since I have neither. It will show how to make this icon:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img33.photobucket.com/albums/v98/vintagepalace2007/icons/mytutorial.jpg""></P>
<P><lj-cut text=""tutorial #1""> </P>
<P>First, I crop a picture to create my base, resize it to 100x100 and get this:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img33.photobucket.com/albums/v98/vintagepalace2007/icons/t1.jpg""></P>
<P>On top of that I create a new layer and set it to screen, so that I can tint it with a color.&nbsp; For this one I'm going with a light pink.&nbsp; I fill that screen layer with #D692AD and get this:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img33.photobucket.com/albums/v98/vintagepalace2007/icons/t2.jpg""></P>
<P>It's a bit too late, so I duplicate the original picture, drag it above the screen layer, and set that duplicate to soft light so that I get this:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img33.photobucket.com/albums/v98/vintagepalace2007/icons/t3.jpg""></P>
<P>At this point I decided that there was enough 'effects' on it for my taste, although you could certainly go on and do an exclusion layer, etc.&nbsp; Play around with it, and have fun!&nbsp; After adding text and a border I ended up with this:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img33.photobucket.com/albums/v98/vintagepalace2007/icons/mytutorial.jpg""></P>

"event","<P>Sometimes I get stuck with what else to do to my icon, so I'm going to comprise a list to 'consult' when I'm stuck with things to do...and most of these I learned thanks to <lj user=""teh_indy"" /> , so I take no credit for 'creating' these or finding them on my own, however I've also learned a few things from <lj user=""heavenli_ee"" /> , so credit is also hers :D.&nbsp; These are listed in no particular order.&nbsp; Also listed: tips for creation of the icon, mostly from observation of other's- better than mine, of course!</P>
<P>1. Duplicate the image and either screen it (to make it lighter) or soft light it (make the contrast more).</P>
<P>2. Make a new layer over the image, set it to Exclusion and fill it with a dark blue.</P>
<P>3. Make a new layer over the image and set it to Multiply.&nbsp; Fill it with a neutral.&nbsp;Best layered over an Exclusion dark blue layer.</P>
<P>4. Don't align the pic in the middle- leaves no room for text or effects, etc.</P>
<P>5. Sometimes icons are best w/o test, but it's a matter of opinion.</P>
<P>6. Duplicate the image layer, soft light it, and gaussian blur it by 6, gives it&nbsp;a nice 'cloudy' effect.</P>
<P>7. Make a new layer over the image, fill it with the color of choice- best if lighter- and set the layer to color.&nbsp; You can leave it at opacity of 100% or fiddle around with it- my fave is at 50%.</P>
<P>8. Fiddle with the sizes and fonts of the text, each word doesn't have to be the same size or font.&nbsp; Mix it up!</P>
<P>9. Play around with gradients, they can make really great effects sometimes.</P>
<P>10. Don't shie away from tiny text- teh_indy and others have proven that it's gorgeous!</P>
<P>11. Make sure that the focus is on the subject of the icon and that the background isn't too busy- sometimes you can select the background it and motion blur it or gaussian blur it or something.</P>
<P>12. Use textures!&nbsp; It adds interest to the icon.</P>
<P>13. Sharpen and then soften with the touch-up tool, it adds a cool 'air-brushed' effect.</P>
<P>14. Fiddle around with the brightness and contrast- it can turn out really cool sometimes!&nbsp; Colors&gt;&gt;Adjust&gt;&gt;Brightness&amp;Contrast.</P>
<P>15. Go wild with text, make it up yourself, use lyrics, use quotes, whatever...but make sure it's relevant!</P>
<P>16. Sometimes black and white icons are gorgeous.......</P>
<P>17. Pick an overall 'theme', or whatever, for your icon, like: ""Clean Lines,"" ""Grunge,"" ""Pop,"" etc.&nbsp; Icons with a mix of all are cool...but they have to be very tastefully done.</P>

<P>Okay, well, now I'm going to talk a little about King Arthur, a movie I saw yesterday with a friend.&nbsp; But, since it will undoubtedly hold all types of spoilers, I'll be doing it in a little 'lj-cut', so this will only appear to be a short entry, although it actually has a lot!&nbsp; Anyways...</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""King Arthur""> </P>
<P>I was super hyped to see this movie because I'm an Arthurian freak in each and every way.&nbsp; The year before last I did a HUGE report on the legend and the truth behind it, and I've read countless books based upon the legend- including ""Mists of Avalon"" which I will plug briefly since it is such a fantastic book.&nbsp; Well, I knew beforehand that the movie was based prior to Arthur becoming king, and it showed the meat of the tale or whatever.&nbsp; It WAS that, and that part of it was great, but I will now be making up a list of random things that either disappointed me, alarmed me, or made me happy; it will skip around, so don't be surprised w/ the jumps!</P>
<P>1. Lancelot's friendship to Arthur is never explained or truly shown, all you see is them fighting, and that isn't friendship.&nbsp; Although Lancelot goes back to Arthur at the end, so does the rest of the knights, it's no basic for 'best' friendship.</P>
<P>2.&nbsp;WHY did Lancelot die? He was a frickin' knight of the round table and served Arthur as a king, and it wasn't even that fantastic of a death, I mean, sheesh.</P>
<P>3. And Tristan...why?!?!?!?&nbsp; Why did he die?&nbsp; I know that he wasn't really a 'member' of the round table, but he was such a fantastic character!&nbsp; Oh, and it also kind of angered me that he had a more glorious death than Lancelot...I mean, Lancelot was legendary for goodness sake!</P>
<P>4. Gawain and Galahad were never really that major of characters, although traditionally they are.&nbsp; It made no sense for Tristan, a non-member of the 'official' knight club thingee to have a bigger part than Gawain and Galahad (although Tristan kicked butt).</P>
<P>5. The quality of the film kept skipping back and forth.&nbsp; One moment is was perfectly clear and sunny, the next it was grainy and crap.&nbsp; It really began to disturb me...</P>
<P>6. Guinivere was a fantastic character in this, I really think that Keira did a great job with her, but she showed up too late to seem to be as large a role as she actually was.&nbsp; And WHERE THE HECK DID SHE GET THAT DRESS?&nbsp; She gets out of that cave thingee wearing rags and then when she's 'healed' (in a rather too short amount of time) she's suddenly wearing a magnificent dress.&nbsp; Hmm....could it be movie magic?</P>
<P>7. King Arthur was brilliantly played, he was every bit as caring and courageous as the Arthur I've always imagined, although he could have been a bit kinder to his foes I suppose...</P>
<P>8. Galahad had a small enough part as it was, but when he WAS talking they made him seem like a wimp!&nbsp; Idiots... Galahad's my buddy!</P>
<P>9. Although I HATE gore and everything that goes along w/ it, I think that the opening could have been a BIT more kind to everything...</P>
<P>10. I HATE the Saxons.&nbsp; </P>
<P>11. I'll think of more later, I suppose, but this is good enough for now...</P>

"event","Okay, well, I'll brieftly touch upon points of unpredictability in the past few days, starting on Thursday:
1)A knife rolled off a table and stabbed me on the foot.  I was spouting too much for comfort.
2)I got away with running a whole 400m during XC training.

Friday:
1)Uhh...my memory sucks.
2)People actually like my story!

Saturday:
1)Went to garage sale which I expected to be completely boring, and it was, but I had fun trying to convince the guys I was any good at tennis (seriously, when you play with crappy players, you become crappy, not saying, though that I'm NOT crappy....)
2)Watched a foreign movie from Afghanistan which I did enjoy, entitled Osama.  Check it out (and no, it's not about Osama Bin Laden.)

Sunday:
1)Ran and felt good about it.  I hardly ever feel good after running.
2)I guess I have 'tendon irritation' in the foot the knife fell on.  Bloody fanastic!

Monday (today):
Well, it started off crappy because I decided I hate math and french was boring, despite the fact that I'm beginning to enjoy it.  Photo, well, that put me into a horrible mood because I thought I was done w/ using the Xacto knives (the type of knife that slammed into my foot on thursday), but my stupid group did the project wrong so we had to start over and I had to use it again.  Great day for me not to wear my safety (tennis) shoes!  I just HAD to wear my cute high heel flip flops!  Ugh.  Idiotic me.  Luckily nothing happened and everything turned out okay.  In science I had fun being stupid me, but my friend dissed me (jokingly, no worries)....And in world history, this is where my day gets better- I got 99% on a project I thought I would get an F on!  Woot!  That excited me beyond imagination.  Anyways, this is long enough for a first post.  Ta!"

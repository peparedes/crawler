went to work.  had an envelope filled with tips that i earned on sunday afternoon.  now that was sweet ass.

then swimming is always fun. tone.

then some of a lecture and passed up the lab.

ended up going to NIU for the intermural floor hockey championship game with diana.  how random. met a group of awesome people.  hehe diana.

i saw this guy chris that i havent seen in over 6 years.........i went to middle school with him......that was soooo werid yet amazing.

d & i had good talks during the drive.......

then on the way home i get like 5 messages to my phone.  it was tom.  he found my wallet in his car.  i had no idea.  i SOO did not do that on purpose.........but maybe it happened for a reason.

dunno whats happening with that yet.

ooo but he wants to come to the hoocah cafe with me sometime.  sweet ass.

oh for yall that dont know........tom was my date for my senior prom.  hes the most charming, intelligent, polite, handsome, funny, ambitious guy i have ever met.  oh yeah did i mention that hes fucking gorgeous & he can actaully dress himself.

so while gettin ready for work yesterday morning i got a call from kim.  i havent seen or talked to her in over 7 months. she wanted me to go to northwestern with her.  so i told her after work i would.

got out from work after 2 then we went over to evanston. we ended up missing the competion but made it for the awards ceremony.

ending up seeing bunches of people.  kathy wisner and i chatted for a while, then talked to matt adams who is now on the purdue team, and of course wildstangers.

katie was supposed to go see guster with me last night but she didnt have $$ to spend.  so i didnt really want to go with my sister and her posse.  i just went through the numbers in my phone......and i think to myself......hmmm ill call tom.

so tom and his friend tim came by and picked me up and we headed out. 

one we got to the theater i hopped out of the car and went to purchase tickets....and boy were we glad i did.....there were only 6 tickets left.  ended up being a sold out show.

the show was incredible. guster was most excellent live.

<img src=""http://64.225.66.112/taboucheesttabou/photography/guster01.jpg"">


music dancing a bowl & awesome people.  it could not get better than that.

so after the concert tom goes to warm up the car to find that it had been towed.

we walked about a mile and a half while it snowed to the tow place.

there were craploads of people from the concert waiting to pay the $125 fee and get their automobiles.

none of us had a credit card on us.  only cash.  we each put in all the money we had and it just happened to be enough.

i felt so bad though, i could tell tom was pissed.

while drivin around a girl from work calls and tells me where the party is. we end up driving around for over an hour trying to find the place.  let me tell you she is no magellen.

so we finally find the place and there are all these guys all ghetto standign outside the house.  yeah we were kinda hesitent & ended up changing our minds about going.

so we drive out to UIC for a differnt party.  i hop out and ring matts buzzer and his roomate andrew (an aston kutcher look-alike for real) answers the door and tells me that matt and everyone went back to arlington hts cuz the girls didnt want to stay out late.  

so that was a bummer..........but then andrew ends up taking us to a party down the street.

ended up getting 3 free cups.  3 floors. 3 differnt groups of people. 2 kegs. 1 party.

i do remember doing the moonwalk.  haha such a hit with drunktards!

didnt stay too long since tim was really hungry.  ended up heading out and looking for some quick cheap food.  nothing was open.  such a bummer. so we ended up going to my house and i made sandwiches and we all hung out for a while.

ended up eating some of a power-gel & powerbar for shits n giggles.  good times.

and stuff and stuff....."

but i must say.........<b>flight of the osiris</b> was pretty kick ass. its the best animation ive seen so far.

ydania and i got in a lengthy convo at work with a customer about the war.  she is a flight attendent for united airlines.  we discussed the war and how its affecting the us and what our views were.  im not pro war but im not anti war........im ambivilent.

this past week has been crazy. school and work non-stop.

i got pulled over ealier in the week for going like 56 in a 40 zone but i managed not to get a ticket or any sort.  hmm i wonder why?

then oen night kates adn i went to go see ""how to lose a guy in 10 days"".  i really didnt think it woudl be that entertaining......but i ws seriously laughing out loud.  i normally dotn like sappy girl flicks but that one didnt see like a typical chick flick.

then wed after classes i went to the fitness cafe new location.  sylvia & i ended up putting shelves together, cleaning stuff, prginizing and bunches of other crap.  thing is.......it took us forever to finish since we are perfectionist and things had to be spotless to meet our standards.

so we ended up not going home and just kept on cleaning and working on things.  then friday came around and still we werent done with everything. 

we ended upstaying there from thursday till saturday morning 2am.  for me that was 35 hours and for her it was 42 hours.

did all that with no sleep at all......all working.

i mean it will be a nice paycheck after all.

then we were back at work at 3pm on saturday to get things ready for teh private party.

we changed the smoothie station into a bar complete with alcohal and glasses.  balloons on the tables.......food preperation and all that good stuff.  people strated to arrive at 7pm.

the other girls adn i just walked aorund serving food and drinks.  

woo i was the only one to get any tips.  yeah.

brittney & i were asked like 6 times if we were twins or sisters.  but no we werent.  we are just the same height & build and have the same hair length and color.  so yeah maybe we do look a little alike.

then syliva & joanna were getting that too.  they are both short with long brown hair too. its strange.

yeah and we noticed that ll the girls that are work for teh fitness cafe have brown hair.....no blondes.  then we realized that rick....one ofthe owners doesnt like blondes......haha funny i think.

oh goodness i have to tell more aobut rick another time......hes crazy.....

brian was tending the bar and so all us girls had a little to drink.

after the party a few of us headed over to ricks for an after party.  gawd i dunno why i even went.  but hey i got  a $1 raise.

haha........good lordy......on the way there while i was following a few other cars i ended up gettign pulled over because i didnt stop before i turned right at a red light.  fukin sucked.

but i guess i sweet talked my way out of that one cuz i didnt get a ticket at all.  muwhaha! im sooo taking advantage of being a girl now its rudiculious.

finally got to ricks house.....fukin beautiful.

so there was stuff going on.....i was more innocent....cuz i mean after all hes my boss.  but there was some girls makin out, lapdances, drinking &  more dancing going on.  gawd it was unreal.

got home this morning all good.  so im happy.  

my room is pretty much done........ive been able to watch dvds in my room now im glad.

tomorrow is grand opening.....im goign to be a fukin workaholic........i love it!

first paycheck goes for powerhouse.  im making sylvia get one too.  so we can go after work together.

then after that i want to try to get my wish list of victoris's secret stuff that ive been dying for.  gawd the stuff is off the hook.

Your Daily Horoscope for March 05, 2003

	
Dear LISA,
Some vivid and wonderful dreams might provide inspiration for future creative projects. You're feeling very cheerful and optimistic about the future during this time, LISA, and your enthusiasm is likely to continue for a while. Success in both career and relationships is indicated, because an increased level of intuition heightens your understanding of others. Don't be surprised, therefore, if friends and colleagues are lining up for your support and guidance and if by day's end you feel closer to those around you.

Your Daily Horoscope for March 07, 2003	
Dear LISA,
A lot of changes could be taking place in your life right now, LISA, and though most of them are very positive, the upheavals can be unsettling for you right now. Don't give in to the temptation to panic. Nothing needs to be done that you can't handle. Take each task one step at a time. As each hurdle is vaulted, the road ahead seems that much easier, and when you arrive, all will be well. Keep going!	
	

Here is your horoscope for Friday, March 7:

The cameras and recorders are rolling, but everyone is still relaxed. You're among professionals, or maybe just hanging out with comfortable people. Be original and feel yourself grow.


Here is your horoscope for Saturday, March 8:

Everything converges in your favor. The Stars bring high energy and low pressure. Endear yourself to others by asking permission, even when you know that you already have it.


Here is your horoscope for Sunday, March 9:

Nothing is permanent, but you've enjoyed borrowing. Stay on good terms with your hosts to ensure another invitation. Refreshed and reset, Cancer is in fine shape for the coming week."

Your Daily Horoscope for February 14, 2003
 
Dear LISA,
""Inspiration"" is the keyword for today, LISA. Your creative talents should really blossom forth and motivate you to get to work on some wonderful ideas. This could involve music or painting, or interior decorating, or planning a wonderful meal. Relax and have fun with it! Whatever you do, you'll probably be very pleased with the results, and feedback from others should be encouraging. Make notes of ideas you don't use today. You'll want to remember them later.

CANCER:

Should you be inclined to let someone know you care, go right ahead.  No, this isn't a Valentine's Day warm-up, and no, your horoscope hasn't been brainwashed by the ""say it with flowers"" slogan.  But yes, the object of your affection or interest is likely to be receptive, and you know what they say about seizing the moment.

Your Daily Horoscope for February 07, 2003
 
Dear LISA,
Don't be surprised, LISA, if you wake up feeling super today. Chances are good that you'll feel a renewed physical strength, with energy to spare. Because of this, it might be a good day to tackle any projects that require you to use some muscle. Perhaps there's some household repairs that need tackling, or furniture you want to move around. On the fun side, you might want to get out to the gym for a workout. Whatever the activity, today is a good day to go for it with gusto!

matt left today for poland.  good chance monica & i will visit over summer.

ctoo out my tounge ring today.  felt so weird.  had to put it back in. new bead woo hoo.

-------------------------

im really not a bitter person. im not.

so some things i regret but im so over them now. of all the events that have happened the past year i think ive managed to pull myself out of the quicksand. im a compleatly differnt person inside & out.

ive opened up & become more like what i want to be.  so its going to take more time but thats fine with me.  im happy. really happy. i like making other people happy & seeing people smile. its like the gas that makes my car run.

im happy for other people.  there is no reason they shouldnt be happy.

so ive only been alive for 19 years but ive learned so much. there is much more for me to learn and im willing.

CANCER:
>>Tuesday, February  4

Rather than reviewing the ""What have I done for them lately?"" list, take advantage of Venus's entry into Capricorn and start musing on the ""What have they done for me lately?"" one.  This could give you improved perspective on partners' and allies' positions and will enable you to craft a more agreeable strategy for dealing with or motivating them.

Don't brush off the compliment when someone tells you how lovely you are. The Stars turn your special secret into a brilliant billboard. Savor this moment while the taste is still strong.

Dear LISA,
Activities of some kind could well put you to some degree in the public eye today, LISA. Some work you've done, and done well, might bring you acknowledgement which is richly deserved. Your energy and enthusiasm are already high, and you'll probably be all fired up to do more. This could bring up thoughts of making changes in your working situation. However, don't turn in your notice tomorrow. Some careful thought is needed.

Friends could phone or come by to congratulate you, and ideas for new projects might come pouring into your head. Take yourself and a friend or romantic partner out to dinner tonight. You deserve it!

Your Daily Horoscope for January 29, 2003
Dear LISA,
Some bizarre and actually rather silly dreams might come to you tonight, LISA. They may be the sort of dreams that are so crazy that you actually wake up laughing! However, don't dismiss them because of this. Silly or not, these dreams are trying to tell you something. Write them down the way you would any other vivid dream, and analyze the symbols in the same way - even if they bring up a few giggles!

Here is your horoscope for Wednesday, January 29:
Someone's got their eye on you. Just how closely will you be watched? That question will be answered by the next move that you make. Grace under pressure is your motto.

CANCER:
>>Wednesday, January 29
One of your great strengths is your ability to weed out fact from fiction. Bear this in mind if a colleague or associate comes along and presents you with their version of events - especially if their version is, shall we say, not consistent with your reality or perception of the situation. 

Here is your horoscope for Friday, January 31:
The wind is shifting. Things are definitely changing. As long as you stay inquisitive and ready for an adventure, you'll win the award for best sport.

tes and i were supposed to go visit deanna on friday but since eds last aprty ended up on friday we went to eds party.  i worked then sylwia came over and then we went to the party.  hehe they loved her.  but it was a drama night. somone ended up stealing her coat. that was drama. tes went home then ed syliva & i went to eat then back to eds since he had work and then he dropped us off at my house. i took a shower while sylivia slept.  she had to be at work at 9:30 and i was going in at 10:30 but i ended up going with her at 9:30. it was intresting workign with no sleep for like the past 2 days. it took me 2 hours to get home from work on sat.  its a 35 min drive. i had to pull over twice and take power naps since i was so fukin tired.

got home and baked brownies and put like 4 bags of m*m's on top.  i wanted to take a nap but i dodtn have any time. tesi and i headed out and got to deannas at about 9:15.

<b>i love milwaukee!</b>

deanna asked me to brign a few shirts......it ended up being 28 i believe.  a wide selection. had a few drinks in her dorm before we headed out.

ended up @ a quaint little party. tesi spots some guys that he went to high school with. its a fukin small world. one of those guys knew 2 guys that i knew in high school. strange.

beer was the drink. im not a fan. did a keg stand cuz thats my style.

then i did 2 more cuz john was giving me peer pressure.

only went to the bathroom in groups of 2 or more.  when deanna and i went one time she found biore strips so we swipped a few. hehe

there was lots of what do you call...yeah dancing.it was exciting....

oh deanna and i drank beer from straws.....hehe that was a hit.

tesi danced eventhough he wasnt feelin well.

after teh party we all pretty much went to some gyros joint. i saw dan caceras from high school. kara made out with him last week when she was up there last week. haha i love kara....she always gives us suprises.

after that we went back to the dorm. ahh but d and i couldnt get checked in because she couldnt find her id.  so john went with tesi to ehr room to get an id of hers so that we could enter.  we chatted it up wtih the saftey guys.  then when john and tes return somehow d finds her id in her bra.  that seriously was hularious.

then up at the room i pass out because of my lack of sleep.  and i guess deanna and her boyfriend john ended up breaking up.  oh but they look so cute together.

woke up at about 11am to meet people for brunch.  i was being called keg stand girl.  i be a legend or somethign they were saying. headed out at about 4pm to go home.  it was a blast.

and tonight syliwa and i were supposed to meet ed jim and whoever at the pool hal but i was so not in the mood.  so its postponed till anotehr day."

Here is your horoscope for Saturday, January 25:
You're a bottomless well of generosity. Transformation isn't a conscious decision -- the Stars just bring it to the surface. You're more wild than tame, but there's something very trustworthy about you.

CANCER:
>>Saturday January 25
Time to give, or take, credit where credit is due. With Venus and Pluto side by side, your achievements in the work, health or emotional well-being arena are emphasized.  And since you couldn't have gotten to your present level or status without some contribution on your part, it would seem that a hearty round of applause is in order.

went over to tesis last night then ended up going to allens house for a while.  waldo was there also.  always good times.

then back to tesis to watch a film. he has work this morning at 8am so he didnt want to go with me.

so i went to powerhouse by myself. i was there for a few hours. when i was finished lance and i got into a conversation.  strange. hes the rude guy. he asked where my guy friends were & what music i was listening to and other inane questions. the boys talk shit of him. but i still talk to mean people cuz maybe.....just maybe i can bring the good out in them.

all i have to say is i will challenge him to a smoothie making contest anyday.  when people come back asking for my smoothies its a hint that im gettin good at it.

soy tastes like crapola as does the mulitiviamin....whey i dont want too much of.....but the egg whites are my fav.  especially in my own concoxion. mmmm mmm good.

pilates was challenging today. im glad im takin that class.

hmm so its all set.  going to marquette next week to visit deanna. kt & tesi are joining me. it will be good times.

i watched some special on pornography today.....really intresting actaully.

but tomorrow.....or shall i say later today kt and i will bake brownies & make some soup for jo since she is sickly over at northwestern.  who knows.....we may just be the cure and then all go out later. hehe.

ive got work today.  im excited.  work really is fun. i like dealing with people cuz i am....well a people person.

yeah i smile a lot. sometimes smirks if the situation calls for it. and trust me.....smirks from me are a GOOD thing.

-----------------------------------------

i have some suprises planned. i hope that they will be well appriciated. if not then i will know that those people dont appriciate my friendship and that is kind of a downer......but those that do are lucky bastards i tell you.

i like to make people smile.

<b>lighten up.....cuz its a dark world we're livin in.</b>

------------------------------------------

ive found an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini in one of my drawers today.  well actaully the one i found is blue with white polka-dots but its got all the other qualities.......its itsy bitsy teenie & weenie.

 Your Daily Horoscope for January 22, 2003

	
Dear LISA,
Today, LISA, is a day to separate the wheat from the chaff. Or, in other words, to take a good long look at your relationships and decide who is a true friend and who is not. You are very loyal, which is certainly to your credit. But what is the point of being loyal to people who do not return the courtesy? You have given your so-called friends more than enough opportunities to demonstrate their affection. As difficult as it may be for you, it is time to let these relationships fall by the wayside. Look at it this way: this will free you up to spend more time with your true friends.

	
<b>ahh this brings back memories...... cancers are loyal & sensitve that i know & i demonstrate.  i have had to deal with those that dont return the loyalty & it has torn me apart. yes maybe i will drop the so-called friends that really arent there when i need them yet i am there at their calling.  so then i will have more tme to spend with my true friends.

just remeber ""friends""......i am loyal & if you want to be a true friend you better be loyal too!</b>
--------------------------------------------

ahh the joys of shopping......for a swimsuit that is.  i ended up finding 5 that fit like a second skin yet no speedos for class.  that was a bummer.

swim class starts in feb....somehow i miscalculated.

ive got pilates tomorrow morning.......or this morning i should say.  then textiles II and fashion arts & design.

oh today i also went out to wheaton to work to get my phone charger that ive left there over the weekend.  talked to scott & sylvia for a while and got my dinner and a spinner smoothie wtih a dumbell.  got i love those spinners.

i dotn even know what time it was when a few of us went to powerhouse.  but hell i jsut got home.  thats what i like about places that are open 24 hours.

its got lots more than harper but i think the only thing that bothered me was that everything seemed crammed into that place.  it could be spaced out some more and they could try not to sell so much crap.  so im gonna try it for the rest of the week and if i can get it for cheap then i will probasbly do that.

i mean i could go in before pilates on tuesdays & thursdays and do a workout.  or even before swimming on mondays and after swimming on wednsdays.  the after work the other days.  ahh perfect.

oh yeah my sister is offically in california living & working.  we shipped her car last wed i think it just got there today. i am going to visit maybe hopefully soon.

hey amtrack tickets are so cheap & on sale now buddies!

but i think friday kt & i are going to visit deanna up at marquette. she loves vistors.

then maybe a week or two after that ill drive down to visit matt. ill try not to break my shoes & challenge people at kegstands again......hey i said ill try.

aye aye i have to visit alex too......he said to come for grand prix week.  hopefully thast when dave matthews is goign to be at purdue.  hell i think im gonna be down there for that too.

yeah trying on bathing suits with color is so much better than not.

<b>i just got the chills but im feelin at ease.........taking a bath then sleepin so well.....</B>"

Dear LISA,
This is the beginning of an exciting period in your love life, LISA. Your relationship with your significant other may have been in somewhat of a rut lately. All that is about to change. Both of you are ready for something big. Perhaps a move is in store, or it could be that you both decide to move to the next level of commitment to one another.

Your score is
23
what does that mean? 
Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful & practical. They see you as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest...Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return. Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over it if that trust is ever broken.

Dear LISA,
Today is one of those days in which, if you want love, you need to go out and get it, LISA. Don't waste your time sitting around at home and sulking. Be adventuresome and take the first step. You are the only one who has the ability of pulling yourself out of the rut, so do it. There is a great deal of passion behind your romantic intentions today so be careful where you point your arrow, cupid.

Your Daily Horoscope for January 15, 2003	
Dear LISA,
Other people may try to wield their power even when it is not necessarily in their place to do so. This is one of those times when people may try to show off their high IQ by offering up random facts that don't necessarily offer anything to the situation at hand, but instead just prove their knowledge of esoteric trivia. Try not to buy into other people's display of power, LISA. More than likely, it is a great deal of hype and not much substance.	


CANCER:
>>Wednesday, January 15

Oh, what a pleasant surprise.  Remain open to the random twist in the tale or statistical anomaly. A situation may not play out the same way that it has in the past under similar circumstances - i.e., what you were expecting based on your earlier experiences - but this shouldn't prevent you from seizing the moment and taking advantage anyway.


Here is your horoscope for Wednesday, January 15:

Sometimes it's just the gesture of offering to help that counts. <b>It's your nature to give, and you're happiest when being generous.</b> The resource that is you will never be depleted.
	
-------------------------

astrology kicks you ass on the curb twofold.

yes yes i am a generous person.........maybe too generous at times. hmmmmm....yeah i am.

i get phone calls in color now.

ill do a work update after work this week.

last night or should i say this morning richee, kt, galka, tesi, matt emily and i went to bowl.

it was good friend times.

i got a few strikes......so close to getting a turkey.

woo hoo high score 137!  haha i even beat tesi....

i requested 2 songs.......lay down sally & could you be loved.  its good when the peopel in teh next to you are singing.

the guys requested some mr roboto and others.

then we hit up clarkes which was at about 1:30am.  

when kt walks in she asks me if one girl is a girl from a party that we went to.

i thought it was the girl at first but when we started to call out her name......she was making all these funny faces.

good lord then we ended up sitting in the booth right next to her and her friends.

i felt like such a dumbass........

ahh but then she comes over and says hi to kt and i and that she didnt recognize us at first.  we chit chatted for a little.

that was just so random.  ive been running into so many people its crazy.

ended up getting home at around 5am......still havent slept yet.

just going to take my pillsies and get ready for a run.

friends......we truely had a good night tonight......it was true fun.

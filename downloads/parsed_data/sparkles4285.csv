"event","Why does nothing ever work out the way I want it to? Between school, guys, work, sorority stuff, and home stuff I have been a very busy, very unhappy person lately. 

School just sux in general. I hate going to class, I hate studying, I basically hate everything about school. I am not doing too well this semester and I do not handle failing well. The psychic said I woudl excel so hopefully that happens soon.

Guys...o I could go on forever. I need to find a genuine one. I thought I did, someone very special, but it turns out he was a lil more important to me than I was to him. O well, my first time ever rejected and it really sux. HAHA The only thing that really bothers me is 1 he lied to me and 2 we can't even be friends. We were very very close over the summer adn now we can't even talk. Kinda sux cuz he would be the one I go to when I need to talk about stupid shit that I won't talk to anyone else about. Oh well I'm over it and waiting for my prince charming.

The sorority lately has been completely falling apart. We argue all the time, can never agree on anything, and in general we just bitch about everything. I mean yea girls are gonna do that, but it really needs to stop. It will soon!!!! Everything will be abck to normal. I miss last semester, it all seemed so different and hopefully it all goes normal next semester!!!

Home... I just miss home soooo much. I miss my family. Espcially my sisters who are my everything. They motivate me and give me a reason to succeed. They are my life line. They are the ones I called when I lost the one person that I thought was different in my life, when I fail a tets, when I'm sick, no matter what the situation I can call them and by the time I hang up the phone I feel so much better. They always tell me I need nobody but them. In many cases it's true. I would be prefectly content telling everything to them instead of my friends, but we all know that's not how it works.

Well this was a long and I'm sure broing post for anybody who reads it. I just need to vent and I decided that this is where I am going to vent and put all my emotions from now on. Then everyone can read it and tell me how pathetic I really am...

"event","So I have been home a little over a week now and all I can say is that I wish I could have stayed in Albany for the summer. It's been a very confusing week. 

Old feelings brought back to the surface, new ones becoming known, and friendships being sacrificed. So I just wish things were back to normal. Being home has never been so depressing.

Well I saw Jessica and Michelle and of course that alwasy makes me happy. Had a great time with them as I always do. They have been and always will be there for me! I Love those girls.

Oh well about 3 months to go and back to Albany. I love being home with my friends, but everything gets confusing when I am home. So lets just get through the summer and pray that everything works out for the best!!!"

"event","Well as everyone knows I am back in Albany and I love it. Came back and have been having a ton of fun. Classes re alright and Kerri's birthday weekend was awesome. But being back here makes me think of everything I miss back home. Mostly the friends, old and new, and family. Also I realize that everything is changing.

The break helped me realize that nothing is ever going to be the way it was before we left. We'll start with the girls. Jessica and I used to be able to finish each others sentences and now we are on completely different page about so much stuff. Now she has the guy and she loves him. I am so happy for her. It's like we switched places. Then there is Michelle and she has not changed much at all which is great! Always stay who you are Bubbles. She is still quiet and seems shy. So cute. It just feels like everything between the3 of us is never going to be like it was before. I know they are gonna be my best friends forever, but will I be their's is the question. I love you girls so much! Then there are the guys. Dan will never change and neither will Mike, but the old friends I don't even talk to anymore. That is just a sign that everything is changing.
 
I was in class the other day and the teacher asked us what we live for. Well many people said they wanna live to help people or see something happen to someone..like graduation or a marriage of a sibling or something. Everything I could think of was solely for me. I am living to accomplish my goals. A plus is that I get to see the people I love accomplish their goals as well, but I don't live for it. I live for me. I guess in a way I feel selfish, but then again I don't. I don't know if anyone knows what I mean. 

So after thinking about everything I realized that change is just a way of growing up. It shows maturity an d it's a part of life. So Everyone else is chaging, but in a way i guess I have to. in the few motnhs I have been away I have become so independent. I no longer rely on other people. It's all about me now! I have to take care of myself, do my own laundry, clean my own room, and take responsibility for my own actions. Feels kinda good. Daddy's little girl is finally growing up. YAY

Well now that I am done clearing my head I am gonna go and get my pilates done!!! I'll update sometime soon...until then *MUAH*"

"event","Well first semester is over...It went by too quickly. I had a lot of fun and I did alright in classes too. Cayuga 300..best suite on campus. Yea well now I am home and counting the day until I get to go back to school.(6 days). I mean I like coming home to see everyone, but there is nothing like being at school. So much freedom. 

Well break has been rather uneventful. Spent the holidays with the family. Spent tons of time with my lil man. That was fun. Lets recap recent events though.

Last weekend I went out with my cousin. Always fun. As usual his goal was to get me completely trashed, but I didn't because someone had to drive home and me being the responsible one stayed sober. Drove him and his friends home. It was actually a very fun-filled evening. 

This past Saturday was a blast. I went to visit some people from work first and we had a lil get together. Played cranium while drinking...bad combination. I was a lil buzzed when I left. The fun started when I saw Jesica na dMichelle. We went bowling!!! It's been about a year since we all went and it was great. We had so much cathcing up to do. So we talked, gossiped, bowled, danced, the usual stuff we do. JEssica is not as innocent as she used to be which makes talking a lot offun becuase now she knows what I'm talking about. Dan and the guys went to. Yup that means Corey was there.(looking pretty good I might add):) We didn't talk. I don't know what happened. We have not talked in a while and now we don't even say hi. It's not like I try to ignore him... I guess I just don't really have much to say. I eman what are we going to talk about??? Oh and yes if you read this I did lose my bet.(I had a bet with someone that I could not go the whole break without seeing Corey. I was not going to try to avoid him, but I didn't really think I would see him.) Oh well I guess he knows I wish him the best and I guess that's all that matters. Jessica came back here that night and we talked for a while. Brought back so many memories of the last few years. My friends at college may be great, but nothing will ever compare to the friends I have here, They are not replacable. I LOVE YOU guys so much!!

This coming Friday I am going to be going to my cousins place for the night. I leave for school on Sunday and me and a couple friends wanna just get trashed before I go back. Yea typical college students I guess. (If you wanna come lemme know) Then it's back to school. But I have quite a few breaks left before I come home for the summer. So I doubt ill miss being home.

Conclusion: This break has been alright. Working, relaxing, chillin with Dan, seeing Jess and Michelle! Home is home, but being away is great. I hope everyone had a great vacation. Good luck to everyone next semester!!!

Until next time...*MUAH*"

"event","Well not a lot has happened since my last post. Classes are still boring, but I am still doing better as time goes on. I make my schedule for next semester in a couple weeks. Looks like im in for no fun next semester. Stats, Macroeconomics, Sociology, A reading class, and a creative writing class. Wow no free time for Ashley. I will be looking forward to May and all those wekkends home when i do nothing. But hey I have to get these classes donet o be eligible for the business school byt spring of my sophomore year. I'll be alright. Just a lil stressed.

As far as the people go I have been spending a lot of time with Veronica and Pudge. We get aling great and the other girls tend to chill together a lot. V and I are usually not included, but that's alright. We make our own fun. We have had a lot of laughs recently. My cousin Heather came here last weekend for a couple nights. She was here on Halloween, but I didn't see her much cuz I was with V and Pudge. She was with Ashley most of the night. Although when we were coming back from the mall some guy scared the shit out of her. That was great! She got pissed cuz we were laughing at her, but it was funny. So she didn't really talk to me for the remainder of the night. TEAR!! NOPE!!!

Saturday afternoon I went home. We left ehre at 130 and didn't get home till almost 530. Someone needs to drive faster. It is only supposed to take 2 hours. So newayz I get home and I'm getting dressed and everything and trying to get ready when Dan calls and sasy ill be there in a minute. Corey wants to leave now. So of cours eI have to rush finishing getting myself ready. Oh well I still looked alright. Doesn't take much. i don't really wear make-up. So it was a matter of getting my hair finished and gettin dressed. So I am always ready in a hurry. So that night I went to see Nickelback, Trapt, and Three Days Grace in concert in Utica with Shaunna, Corey, Dan, and Ken. It was a lot of fun. I enjoyed it very much. I got home around 1230 or so and my one of my two best friends was on-line (Jessica). She told me she was home and since i was home to I went to visit her. I was there for 3 hours. Prolly could have stayed for like days. We had a lot of catching up to do. It was great to finally see her again and to hear about how happy she is. It's about itme. I don't think I have ever seen her this happy. I've known her for a few years and she is happier now than she has been in those 3 years. 

Sunday I had to come back here. I came back and V and Pudge were chilling watching TV and of course they get angry when i play music so i did it juts to make them mad. Yea they listen to rap so our tastes are very different. But it's fun to annoy them. Nobody around here has ever heard of Trapt. They are kinda pathetic around here. 

I don't get to go home again until Thanksgiving, but that gives me a lot of time to study. I have quite a few tests this month. But I guess that's it.

Until next time...FUCK OFF...*MUAH*"

"event","Well I am back in Albany after a long weekend at home.. HAPPY BIRTHAY TRACI!!!! When I got back I had a long talk with Veronica about life and everything. Brought back some memories and I realized a few things.

As everyone who reads this knows my Dad passed away many years ago. This was a very tragic event for me. He was my life when I was a lil girl. I was daddy's baby. Now that he is gone a piece of me is gone with him. So I relaized that that event in my life is why I won't let many guys get close to me. I was very close to him, I am very close to my Uncle, and I let one guy get close to me in a relationship kind of way and as history shows I got hurt. I don't blame anyone for this, but thinking about everything today made me realize that I don't let/ want people getting close to me. And those that I do must be special. Going to the cemetary made things a little bit easier. I was very grateful to have the one guy I allowed myself to love to take me there. I don't know if I ever thanked you, but it meant more to me than anything in the world. I was able to say my good-byes while I was there and having Corey there with me made everything seem alright. He will be the only guy who ever gets to see me go throught something like that. I never went to the grave before then and I will never go back again. Waht I needed to do was done and it was a great feeling. I loved my Dad more than anything and to have Corey there with me when I said Good-bye made it easier because I knew I had another guy to love me.

Now today I am still very grateful for everything my life has been. I had a father who had so much love for me, I have a family who supports me through everything, and I have had an amazing person fall in love with me. What more could a girl ask for at the age of 18. 

Many people have been very worried about me since I lost Corey. They knew that it was like another guy letting me down...leaving me to never return, but I am doing fine.  I don't feel I have really lost out on anything. Love is something that never goes away and in my heart that if I ever need to talk about something important Corey will listen and I believe my Dad is listening as well. I still have those down days, but I am happy now and one day I know I will be as ahppy as I was at the end of my senior year.

Having a talk with Veronica tonight just made me thankful for everything I have ever had.  My heart has been broken and my life has had it's shitty times, but I am alive and I have many people who care about me. So now it is time to remember the past, but not to let it control my future. Thank You to everyone who has ever helped me get through the tough times."

"event","Ok well I am going to give the short version of everything that has been happening.

Last weekend Dan was here to visit me. I was ill so we didn't really do much but it was fun. Kinda chilled and chowed. The bus ride was an experience. Also the phone call was funny. Good times Dan.

This past week I went to the health center to figure out what was wrong with me. I figured I had the flu or something, but nope I had a kidney infection. Not good. Very painful. I've been inside most of the week. Can't do much until I fifnish my medicine, but of course I'm feeling much better now. Other than that I've been studying and having lots of fun with the suitemeates. One night we had a real cooked dinner!!! Ashley made chicken and Stacey made vegetables and desert. It was delicious and so much better than school food.

This weekend I of course could not do nething fun because I am allowed no alcohol consuption of any kind until this kidney infection is gone. SO I could not go out with my suitemates and I could not hang out with the guys. So Friday I watched movies with the girls and Saturday i watched the game with Ashley.. Very uneventful. Today is football and homework just like it is every Sunday. 

This week I have 2 tests..no problem, then this weekend I am going home to spend my sisters birthday with her. Yup I am a nice sister. She is taking me out with her. Lets see if it is as fun as going out here..Very doubtful. Then the following weekend my cousin is coming her eto visit me and thenI am going to a concert with Dan on Saturday. So that's what to expect.

Until my next update...FUCK OFF!!! *MUAH*"

"event","Well a lot has happened since my last update. It's been a lot of fun here in Albany. Classes are beginning to get a bit more difficult, but all that means is that I have to focus a lil more of my attention on work rather than everything else ;)!! 

So onto what has happened..Well I movedd out of one room into another. That is exciting because now I am in the big room and Veronica is hardly ever here. That can be both good and bad. HAHA!! Everyone decided it was best if we all swith..so now im rooming with the spic..lol!!! She's great and we get along really well. I can be a smart ass with her and she doesn't take offense to it. She gives it back and it's fun. I have changed a lot since high school. I am having a lot of fun now. I mean I had fun at the end of high school, but there are obvious reasons to that..The people!!! I don't let small minor details bother me. 

Oh I can do laundry now too. That's exciting. I never did it before I got here. I also clean everyday. I hate mess.. I'm gonna make such a good wife someday..LoL!! You know...I've been with my suitemates a lot recently. We spend tons of time together. We are all like sisters and we all connect well. If you know what I mean.

I went home last weekend..That wasa blast. i surprised U. Don for his birthday. He was so happy. Friday and went to twokr to visit everyone. They were happy to see me. Then I went to chill with Dan for a couple hours  when he got out of work. Saturday I spent a few hours at Hooters and then went to play Cranium with people from work...good game. I'm gonna buy it so that we can play it here. Then Sunday I chilled and came back to Albany. I love home, but college is awesome. I'm going home for anoher long weekend this coming weekend. Spending time with my sisters whom I miss more than anybody. 

Well nothing going on this week. Classes..working-out...studying..tanning.. oh and going out to a bar on Thursday with the suite. That will be fun. Finally we are all free on the same night. 

I miss having that one person there to help me. I have to take my own advice now. It's prolly the same advice he would give me anywayz, but it helps to hear it from somebody else. All in al i miss everyone, but some more than others. I'm happy and there are only a few things that could make me happier, but hey live everyday as if it is your last and that's what I am doing. Everythign will work out for the best in the end.

To everyone not here...I Love You all so much. You have made me the person I am today and I will never be able to thank you enough. 

Until next time...Fuck Off..*MUAH*"

Newayz college is still fun. This past weekend was a blast. I went out clubbing on Friday. Drank a lil too much and did not feel well. Saturday I slept a lot and then went to the guys room to drink. Very enjoyable. Ther eis one particlular person over there that I don't mind seeing all the time. Sunday was boring, homewokr and shit.

The work is picking up a bit, but nothing difficult. A lot of reading and understanding. Had my first test in math, but there were no numbers on the test...all letters. Not good. Other than that the courses and everything are pretty simple.

This week I will be doing many things. Wed. I will be attending the men's soccer game..:) Then Wed., Thurs., and Fri. night I have to go to the rush events. Bonnie is coming here on Stuarday to visit. Very excited about that. Then in 18 days I get to go home. I am kind of excited. I love it here most of the time, but i miss the people at home.

So until I update again... *MUAH*"

Lot more mature, but stil up for some fun. Thanks to an unnamed person I know that sex is just sex so who really cares. So yup I'm having fun. Drinking is far better here too. The guys get you whatever you want. Just to get you drunk enough to do stupid shit, but it's still fun. So all in all college is way better than home.

Classes are not bad at all. Lots of work to do, but thats for Sunday night. People seem cool. I wanna go home to see everyone, but it can wait. One of my sister might be coming in a couple of weeks and then Dan is coming here in October to visit me. YAY!!! I am very excited. So I guess that's all for now. I'm sur I'll have more to say after this weekend is over!! :)

She is pretty cool. We went to our lil activities together and everything. It was very long and boring. Seminars on rape, alcohol, and saftey are very uninteresting. Oh well now im chillin here and all of my suitemates and my roomate has moved in. They all seem cool. I guess we wil see as time goes on.

In toher news I was very unhappy on Friday... I wonder why. Ashley and Corey arguing again. Wow I'm sure that is surprising. NOPE, but of course it was just some stupid bitch trying her hardest to ruin our friendship. plan backfired. uh oh. Everything is ok now I think. Who knows. But I kinda yelled at poeple i shouldn;t have and I'm sorry. I was biotchy and once again i was crying so I let my emotions get the best of me.

Newayz that last week or so has been fun. I had my last day of work last Friday. It was very sad. I cried when I said good-bye to Bonnie. SHe is like my sister at EVC. 

I attended the krockathon. THat was a lot of fun. I crowd-surfed for the first time. That was a blast even though somebody scratched me. THen I was dropped on my back. So huge guy fell on me, but then I found some guy who tried to protect me from those big people. Nice guy he was. Shaun was wasted. He is kind of abnoxious, but a lot of fun when he is drunk. On the way home we were stuck in traffic for a hwile listening to music to give the guys a headache. Corey was acting gay. That was funny! Then we came home. Me and Jess went to Shaun's. Had a few shots and passed out. We were pretty tired. 
Sunday we took the jet-ski out. That was fun, but I was in some serious pain when I woke up on Monday. I went to Watertown and then to Rochester on TUesday. Did some shopping. Then did some more shopping Wed. Today I am going to be at the fair all day and then back home to spend some time with the sisters, Traci, Shaunna, and Christine. Corey and dan will be here too. I have to say g'bye to cOrey tonight, but that's ok cuz I'll still talk to him. Many of my friends leave tomorrow. I don't leave until next Wed. More time to pack.

Sunday~ I went shopping last Sunday! I needed to get some stuff for school. I love going shopping and spending money on myself. It's the greatest ever. Spending on other just is not as fun! So now I have a few things left for school and I'll be getting those this week ro next week.

Monday~ I went to Watertown to get some money! Finally!!! I bought a jet-ski with my uncle. We each bought one so we have 2 for when we decide to do those family things.

Tuesday~ I worked all day on Tuesday. :(

Wednesday~ I kinda just chilled on Wed. I think! It was  while ago I don't exactly remember!

Thursday~ Thursday was kind of a sad day. In the morning I got up went to Staples to get a new graphing calculator. i lost mne. Then I went bought a movie, dvd, and cards for special people. Thank You and Birthday cards. Ten I went to lunch with Jen. It was nice. We talked a lot about guys. She made me realize something. She is such a great help in the little things I can't ask corey for help with. I said good-bye to her. That was sad. She's like my big sister, but hey I'll be back hopefully.

Friday. I had to get up and get ready for lunch with the chicas. Jess, Michelle, Alyssa, Kristen, Mrs. Dwyer, Mrs. Harding, and myself all went to lunch. That was a fun day. Of course one of our big topics was Ashley's love life. non-existant. LoL! Yup they wanted to know all about Corey...what's new? I then came home and took Traci to the mall! We spent some quality time together. Friday night Shaunna and I went to see SWAT. colin Farrell is gorgeous. Pretty good movie too.

Saturday~ Saturday Traci and I went to the mall ocne again. I had to get a coupls sweaters and some sneakers. I came home and slept until like 600. Thjen I believe IO went out for a walk with Dan. Good walking buddy!!

Sunday~ Took the jet-ski's out!!! That was pretty fun! Not the greatest, but some of the peopler present ruined the fun! I came home went to Shannon's to get a movie and ended up staying for dinner and a couple drinks YUMMY!!! Then I watched the movie and called itr a night.

Monday! I drove to Watertown to get my money :) Went ot see a financial advisor. That meeting took forever, but it was in my best interest adn what I found out made me very happy! Then I camh ome packed my bags and left for Buffalo to get Kristen. From there we left for Cedar Point.

Tuesday~ We arrived at our hotel at around 130. I fell asleep right away. Woke up at like 700 to shower and get ready. Went to Cedar point for the day. It was awesome. Roller Coasters are great. I'll never go on another like the ones there in my life. Wile ther eI also relaized that I must be a pretty cute kid. LoL!1 Wonder Why I would think that. We left that night to head back to Buffalo, and came home. I went to sleep and now it's Wed. and I'm here writing this. About to go to work! FUN!!!

Other things that went on this week. I walked everyday, tanned, had a talk with Corey. Took his advice and I'm on ym way to being healthy again. It takes time, but I am going to get there eventually.

*Tuesday* I called into work on Tuesday. I wasn't feelig really well when I got out of bed. SO I slept until 300. Then I went to visit Mike's mom. Jeff came home and she wanted me to go and say hello. Well I get there and she tells me that Jeff won't be home until like 1230. Oh well. THen Mike came home and his mom asked me to stay for dinner. I told her I would, but that I had to get something done first. So I left and went to the bank to get some money to give to dan for Jessica's ticket to the krockathon. Well Dan was at Ken's with the other guys playing Halo so my intention was to just bring the money and leave to go back to dinner, but that plan didn't work out. I stayed and talked to Dan and watched the guys play Halo for about 45 minutes. I called Mike's mom and told her I was sorry about dinner and that I would be back sometime. I came home and chilled with the fam before heading off to bed. Oh yea and I got tot alk to Jessica for like an hour :)!!

*Wednesday* Wednesday I woke and had to get ready for work. How fun! So I woked 10-5. Not a bad day. On my lunch I went to get mysunglasses which I left at Ken's house only to find that someone made the nosepiece fall off. I took dan home and left when everyne got there to go swimming. Some people may think I left because everyone arrived, but I was only on lunch and I had to get back to work. I also found out that I can have all of next week off. YAY!!! Yea so after I wokred I went to the mall to go shopping. I ended up getting some pants and shirt and other unmentioned things. I was in Kaufmanns when dan came up behind me. He was taking his 5 hour, but was on a break going to get Jessica's ticket. He was gonna be late so I just got it for him. Then I came home to an empty house and got ready to go to Dan and Jen's for some pizza. They played cards while me and casey watched Paradise Hotel. Good sho. at around 1130 I had to come home because I had to wrok the next morning. That was a fun night. It's funny what people will do or say when they are drunk.

*Thursay* I went to the Y at about 700. Then went to twokr from 10-630. Came home watched a movie with the family and just kinda chilled. Pretty boring day.

*Friday* I woke up went to the Y again in the morning. worked 1030-7. Then I came home to get into some comfy clothes. I went to the movies and saw American Wedding. Very funny! Any movie that can maek me laugh, get sick, and almost cry is def. worth it! LOL I saw some friends at the theatre. Yup I have a few friends WOW amazing! Got around around 1205 to call it a night cuz I had to be to work at 825 the nxt morning! 

*Saturday* I was at work at 825 that mornign for some boring meeting about sunglasses. I asked to go to lunch late so when I came back I only had a small amount of time left before I leeve. I went to lunch at 200. Came back to wrok did everyone's elses jb and got stuck there until 430 cuz some people don't realize that we close at 4! I was very angry. I came home to watch a movie with Shane, went to pick up my cousin at the hospital, then came home and slept. I wasn't feeling to well so sleep was just the medicine I needed.

Now it's Sunday and I don't really know what I am doing today. I have to get some Thank You cards done and mayeb pack away some more stuff for school. Only 25 more days until I leave. AWW I'm gonna mis everyone. :( A select few more than others. As for what is to come in this next week. one day of work unfortunatley, a talk for some advice from the best advice giver in the world, maybe a movie if someone will go with me,lunch ith people to say good-bye, and possibly a trip to Darien Lake.

"event","Well I haven't done much that's journal worthy. This past weekend was fun. Saturday I got of work early an went to my cousin's house for a fun night. Corey, Dan, Shaunna, and myself had a few drinks that night. We ordered pizza and watched movies. Then we all passed out on the floor. There is more, but I'll keep that to myself. Sunday I came home and just chilled with my family before going to a bbq at Doc's house. We ate, listened to the symphony, had a few drinks, and then watched fireworks. Monday I went to the Dr., went to the Y, and then the dentist. Trying to get my health back to where it should be. Next Dan's house. We watched a couple movies and ate some Arby's. I came home packed some shit away for college, then went to sleep cuz I had to get up for work in the morning. Today I got up at 630. Went to the Y and hen off to work around 10. On lunch I went to media play to buy a couple cd's then home to eat. The back to work until 7. After that went tanning and now I am home typing this. Next I am off to read my book and sleep. Have to get up early to go to the y and be to work at 9. Fun! 

Until next time...<3"

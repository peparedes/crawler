I got talking to this dude on line - (we'll call him 'SG' for now) - just talking shit, talking crap and larking around.  Talking about stupid nonsensical stuff that had us wetting ourselves although most other people would find it totally absurd and not at all amusing. Anyhow, this dude gave me his phone number, so we enter into this ridiculous barrage of text messaging each other and then he rings me.  We spend 4 hours on the phone talking bollox and laughing our asses off.  We then spent a week of absurd texting and late night marathon calls and then decided to meet up.
So, I met up with SG last Saturday night....was a wicked night....went to a bar, few drinks, then came back to mine and watched comedy DVD's all night - proper fucking excellent, can't remember the last time I laughed my ass off so much.  
Anyhow, we had a wicked time, he cam e round again in the week and is coming over again tomorrow......so I guess you could say I was sorta seeing him...?
But the whole thing has fucked me man - knocked me for 6....totally thrown me! I wasn't looking to get involved with anyone, I was feeling anti-relationship totally, but this is different...this is fucked up...this makes me feel dizzy if I think about it too much...this just isn't me man!
I dont do soft, fluffy crap like this...I dont do thinking about someone 24/7..what the hell is wrong with me....I can't decide if I like this feeling or not.  I'm a control freak and this is well, out of my control and it's freaking me out.  Is this normal? Is this what other people feel like?  Someone slap me hard - please!"

Don't you just hate it when people 'appear offline' but you know they are signed in?  Especially some fucker that is telling you that they're in love with you (AJ!) What a fucking load of bollox, I can't be arsed with this crap anymore, so far as I'm concerned we obviously aren't even friends - b/c you wouldn't treat a friend like that - let alone someone your supposed to have feelings for.
I met a nice bloke at the weekend and turned him down - as I promised AJ I'd wait for him - how fucking stupid am I.  To hell with it.  He's got until the end of the week, then I'm blocking him and deleting his number.   I'm sick to death of being messed around...do people find it funny to fuck with someone that's already in a pretty fragile place? Where the fuck do some people get off?  You befriend someone right and over period of time you get to know them and get to know what's going on in there life. AJ knew all about what has happened to me in the last 6 months and has been a real rock......then he tells me he has feelings for me....then he totally blanks me....WHAT THE FUCK?!
To hell with him, man, I hope no-one crosses me today...I'm in a fuck the world mood and people are going to get trampled if they don't stay out of my way."

"event","Been a weird weekend, felt strangely detached from everyone and everything.  I can feel myself slowly becoming more withdrawn.  Haven't been to the gym in a month - the one thing that makes me happy and safely lets me vent some anger.  Just can't motivate myself enough to go, which isn't good as instead I sit and brood and the anger bubbles quite nicely just below the surface.

Not heard from AJ, which is depressing - yet again I know I've been taken for a fool - why am I so trusting - why do I always believe people? I dunno, I don't get it.....I held back and didn't encourage the situation, I didn't want to be hurt again, then he opens his heart tells me that he loves me and I start to feel again.  I let him in and I trusted him and then all of a sudden I don't hear from him.  Before he told me that he loved me, we spoke everyday. Two weeks ago he declared his feelings and since then he's spoken to me twice.  No more cute e-mails when I wake up everyday...no more texts...no more nothing.  Why am I such a romantic at heart?  Not that I'd ever admit that out loud.  The picture from the outside is hard and tough - not to be messed with, yet if only they knew the real me.  I had let AJ see the real me.....I wish I hadn't.  Why did I have to let my guard down again. I'm such a fucking idiot.

Went for a few drinks last night with friends, drank too much and shot some pool, just looked around at people and wondered why some people's lives are so easygoing....some people just seem to flow along in life.  Me, I lurch from one disaster to the next.

At least I didn't get any trouble off FS (the EX) this weekend.  Nothing has happened since last Sunday - when I got followed home by two car loads of men.

Anyway, now AJ has made me feel suitably stupid I've decided that I need to sever all ties with him, just don;t think I can do it just yet.  There is still a part of me that secretly hopes every time I get a text message that it's from him....everytime I go online, I ache with the anticipation that he may have e-mailed me.   I hate myself for feeling like this - someone fucking shoot me please."

"event","Ok, so here's where I'm at and how I got there.....

Tomboy....hated being a girl as a kid - thought it represented weakness. Had a pretty fucked up childhood in some ways.  Hated school - yet somehow managed to get myself a good education.  Didn't get on with my parents until I moved out of home at 17. Drank far too much(still do), met a guy, did too many drugs, got married .....split up 15 months later.  Spent next 5 years trying to sort out the shit he left me with. I bottomed out and crawled my way back up.  Met a new fella....spent 4 years trying to get out of an abusive relationship.  Managed to leave him 6 months ago - he still stalks me and harasses me.  I get followed everywhere I go and my every move is watched.

I am now single - and will probably continue to be for some time to come.....twice bitten....can't be fucked to go through it again!   I have my own home, a great friend as a lodger and a fantastic relationship with my family.  I have a good job and I work fucking hard. I am a good friend and will do anything for the people that I care about.  I have fallen for someone I've never met and can't quite get my head around it.

I don't let people in easily and I don't suffer fools lightly."

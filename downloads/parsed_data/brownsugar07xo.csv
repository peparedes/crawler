it feels like the end of the road. i am not excited about anything. i am dreading the change. i am angry that i have to leave the ones i love. i am more insecure and more sensitive than ever.
i have no passion, no interest in anything.

"event","So yesterday was quite the day. I got my license!
I went home, and drove over Starbucks and then to see my Katha. Then I went home and my daddy left for Europe and India. Then I DROVE to Quizno's and got Gio a sandwhich. Then I went over to Natasha's house and Natasha and Gio and myself went to Stoneridge to get Natasha a dress and shit for prom. So, we're in Macy's and Natasha's having trouble picking a dress with Gio watching. So we went our separate ways, and I needed a bra for my dress. So...we go to Victoria's Secret. I died. I don't know what size I am anymore because I grew. Okay? I grew. So I tell Gio and he laughs and says well then ask someone. But, I just couldn't. jkhsfhskjh it was so RETARDED. so then I had to leave the store. And there was an awkward silence while we were walking back until we went into Hot Topic. 
So, we're back with Natasha, and I look in my purse to get my phone. It's not there.
I freaked out. We spent about an hour retracing our footsteps, asking shop keepers if they found my phone. I was in a really bad mood at this point, because it'd be the third time I lost a cell phone, and the last time I did was in the very same mall. So I tell them to leave me alone, and I'll look for it myself. I thought maybe I had thrown it away by accident, so I spent the next 45 minutes sifting through trash cans by myself.
I cried.
I gave up.
I came back to them. Was a complete bitch. A downer on everyone's evening.
So then Natasha, Gio, Rajni, and I all go to Victoria's Secret. They made me go up to someone and get measured. That was traumatizing, because I was protesting the entire time and Natasha was telling the lady not to listen to me.
So it turns out im a 34B.
Then, Natasha ask the ONLY MAN working about a bra for me. So, he brings out this contraption and explains to the four of us how it works. My dress is a backless halter, so the bra has the straps that go under the halter, and then for the back the bra has this weird thing that goes around and hooks on your waist. It was bizarre. Then Gio told the man that my prom date would have a tough time with that one. And I died again.
Right after this...my phone starts calling Natasha.
Turns out I left it at her house...and her mom saw 22 missed calls and called.
That was uplifting.
So in conclusion, I'm an awkward, uncomfortable silly girl.
We then dropped Gio home, and I spent the night at Natasha's house. But I ended up sneaking out with someone from like 1230 until 4ish. mwahaahah.
I went to bed around 5, woke up at 7. Drove home.
Then I watched The Craft..which was one of the weirdest movies ever.
And now I'm here...recording that day because it needs to be recorded. have a nice day."

But the acting and the play was really very well done, I forgot I was in a high school play, it was intense. Oh I wore a skirt last night to Natasha's party. Anna came over and we got ready together. I felt like a woman. Because of the skirt, not getting ready with Anna silly. We then proceeded to Natasha's...spent an hour taking hits of helium. It was hilarious. Except I had a cig, didn't bother me at all, but as soon as I inhaled helium, shit dude I was coughing up a storm. Anaywas, there was tons of laughter and giggles and pictures and sandwhiches. I enjoyed myself. After everyone left a few of us went bowling in Concord...yeaaahhh not going into that. I ate my first hash brownie on the way there hahahha. It was fucking disgusting I couldn't finish it because I'm retarded. It was an interesting night, there was a ton of lights in the bowling alley and a disco ball which given my state of mind, was very, interesting. It was fun fun fun. And then Natasha, David and I were watching Pirates when we got home and I decided I'm going to kidnap Depp and take him to my house. Ew and I have so much homework that needs to be done...this week is going to be hell what with all the shit teacher's are trying to pack in before break. God help me."

"event","So I just found the song Back Here by BBMak. I had listened to this song all the time when I was little. It brought back all the memories of living in Massachusetts and made me realize that I really really miss being little. I remembered everything being so simple and being so happy and running wild along the open grass fields and through the forests, causing trouble with all the neighborhood kids. I remembered coming home to my mommy and daddy and baby sister, and nothing being awkward with them. I thought I would always have my mom to run to whenever I felt like a warm embrace. And my dad, who amazed me with all his magic tricks that convinced me my dad was better than everyone elses. The rush of memories was so overwhelming, I'm sure everyone's expierenced it.
Now, it's hard for me to even tell my mom I love her, and I can't say it to my dad. Everything we talk about is small talk, and we are utterly disconnected. My mom doesn't like me. I mean, she loves me, but she doesn't like me. My sister is in middle school and we are constantly bickering. I won't even get into things with my dad. There's no adventures to go on with other kids, college is no longer a million years away, and the happiness I found in simplicity is gone. I've destroyed it all with too much thought and complications of every sort. I had become desperate and hungry for friends and changed myself completely. I don't even know the little girl with hair down to her butt running around with no shoes near the swingset in my old backyard in Massachusetts. As far as I'm concerned, that girl is dead. I guess what I'm getting at is that I sat down and realized that I'm old. I know I'm only 16, but that feels really old to me. I don't want to grow up. 
Today I hung out with Kat and David and Alyssa and her friend. David drove Kat and myself to Starbucks and Derek(works there) gave us free food that he was going to throw away. The 4 of us exchanged tidbits of our life stories over coffee and then we enjoyed a car ride back in David's Mercedes blasting ""Big Balls"" by ACDC. Then we came home and sat in Alyssa's parked van and blasted EVERRRRRYYYYBODYY HURRRTS and it made me happy. I'm really glad it's Thanksgiving break, I am sick of school! But then again, who isn't? Oh, and also, I ate 4 pieces of pizza today plus philly cheese steak at Kat's house. Stuart ordered a pizza to trig. Twas funny. I have 7 cds to load this weekend. I'm excited. And I have my pen and ink drawing. What a wonderful life I live. (this entry took an optimistic turn as you can see). Okay, I'm done rambling for now oh wonderful livejournal. meow."

That makes it sound like I'm really dependent on other people...well I was. 
But now, it's kindof nice to have that pressure gone, of always doing things for that person. And now I don't expect that much from any ""best"" friend, so there's no expectations to let me down. I don't know, I'm just kindof enjoying the solitude. It's not like I'm totally alone, I stil have friends. There's just no really close bond anymore, no one to automatically assume I'm hanging out with since it's Friday. You know you're best friends when you automatically assume you're hanging out with them since it's Friday. ""What are we doing on Friday"" sortof thing. These are the people I need to plan things out with, make a meeting time and place, keep up the small talk, be polite to, etc. I guess it's better this way. Now I'm just rambling, but I've just never really been sooooo. drifty. Only greater things can come."

So much so that I haven't been myself. Now I don't even know who I am.  So I've decided it won't kill me to just stay home by myself.

"event","Today was a day in which I had no desire to interact with anyone that I knew.  I took a 2 hour bike ride with my ipod and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The bike ride was followed by watching a documentary on the History Channel about September 11th in which I found myself crying throughout the whole thing. Now I'm watching The Negotiator because I love Samuel L. Jackson. This entry is an embarrassment but I am posting because I don't care. good riddance."

"event","Last night I had the most amazing, realistic, detailed dream that I can remember.  It was very long also, considering I slept 14 hours.  I had trouble deciding whether it was real or not as I was waking up, it was so real, long, and detailed.  Basically what happened in it is I was in the mall with my family: my mom, dad, and little sister.  All of a sudden we're in this store that sold these like, fake Harry Potter dolls...and I see the Backstreet Boys. And holy shit I am so damn excited...it was amazing.  And no one else seemed to recognize them but it didn't faze me. I walked right up to AJ (he's the one I am in love with, although if you claim you know me then you would already know that) and I was like ""OMG HI!"" I was well aware that I was being a silly little teenage girl fan but I couldn't help myself, it was AJ I mean, come on. So then all of a sudden, the men who were in the store who had been posing as customers but were really undercover agents who protect the Backstreet Boys jump into action. I was reprimanded and the Backstreetsex Boys were led out of the store and I watched them be taken to this room that was all black and I caught a glimpse of all these high tech computers and blinking lights and shit. Anyways, the big black man who has restrained me let me go and told me to go on my merry way. So anyways, my family and I continue shopping, when all of a sudden I see a mob of people all around who else, but the Backstreet Boys!! Of course, they are rushed out again into the black room and the crowd dispersed.  Then I was on the top floor, and all of a sudden I see this group of 5 security guards going down the escalator.  But then I looked at their faces, and OH MY GOD it was the Backstreet Boys in disguise!!  We caught eachother's eye, and I knew they were disguised so they could escape from the crazy fans, so I didn't say anything to ruin it. I just smiled at them, and they waved back.  About an hour later, I was looking around and THERE THEY WERE AGAIN.  So this time, I went up to AJ and said, ""Do you mind if we take a picture together? You've been my favorite singer ever since I was little,""  And he replied, ""Yeah sure,"" So then I was like, ""I'm sorry it must be so bothersome to have all these fans in your face all the time, I couldn't even imagine not being able to go to the mall and being bombarded by a bunch of people,"" and he said, ""Oh, I got used to it, thanks for understanding,"" So as my sister is taking our picture, something goes horribly wrong. The camera just won't click. And finally it does but for some reason the only thing that worked were side shots but it worked in the end. Then I hugged each Backstreet Boy, and AJ was so damn fine.  Then I left them alone, as a mob of people ran towards them.  Then, my family and I left and walked to the parking lot, and we got in our car. Then I woke up and it was 2 in the afternoon.  And I couldn't decide if what had just happened was real or not. But, then I figured out that it was but a dream.  Then I listened to the Backstreet Boys. Backstreets Back, ALRIGHT!!

I think that entire dream was caused by the recent news that Kevin left the Backstreet Boys, and this upsetting news induced the dream about them."

"event","It always comes back to this journal, which i love and hate. i love it bc it will listen, but i hate it because the only time i use it is to express thoughts i wouldn't want to share directly with someone, or to complain. So,here I am. complaining. I wish friends were actually dependable. I wish I didn't get caught up in the silly high school drama and gossip...I have way more important things to worry about. When you need people the most, you find out how unreliable they really are. And I hate it."

"event","So I've calmed down a bit since the last day of school. My summer has basically consisted of eating, sleeping, cleaning, IMing, and myspacing. But I deleted my myspace today. I'm reading a really interesting book called The Verificationist. The entire book is a psychoanalysis of a hallucination that this guy has while at a dinner party in a pancake house.  I think that I need to do something productive, because I don't know what to with myself. And I'm in such a weird mood lately that I keep listening to System of a Down, Tool, and 50 CENT?!?! wth.  Anyways. I am very excited to go to Day in the Meadow to see the Lovemakers, Violent Femmes, and Thriving Ivory. And also I really want to go see Every Move a Picture and the Rakes. I'm soooo. bored. And now I'm making myself a big fat salad and putting everything I can find into the moshpit of greens. moshpit makeout."

"event","Hellooo. Schools almost almost over. We've got like 4 more weeks and I am very excited. Although I am not looking forward to finals at all. (but who is). As usual, nothing's going on in my life. Well, nothing that I wish to discuss on some online journal thingie. But I would like to state that I am absolutely fed up with some people, whose names I won't mention, mainly in my history class, who have NO respect for anything. I just want to ask them if they've ever thought of anything other than themselves and if they are aware that there is a world outside of Danville. I just. GAH. breathe. Anyways. I have come to the conclusion that I am extremely repetitive and predictable. And I complain too much. I love you."

"event","Todays events have led me to believe I need some sort of an output for my thoughts because it is quite clear it is extremeley irrational to confide in a friend. This is because either that person doesn't care, doesn't understand, or will spread it around. But I didn't come here to bitch about people. Well maybe, but thats for a later vent. I don't really care right now. So if I didn't come here to vent then what did I come for? I don't know. But I'm here. Story of my life."

I'd like to say I've achieved some sort of goal or done something worthwhile that I could tell you about.  In reality, I have just been going on with school work.  Haven't even finshed Driver'sEd. I could have been driving in December.
Although.
I have recently rediscovered Amazon.com as a source for cds.  One can get music so much cheaper from there. It's not even funny. Actually, it must be funny because it makes giggle.

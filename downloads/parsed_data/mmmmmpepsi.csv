"event","So I was just going over the last hundred or so journal entries on this thing and I have come to realize that the shit I cared about then was completely ridiculous! Those old entries are so single minded and one sided. They were very pitiful and and selfish. How did anyone put up with me? Haha
I was going through them, deleting most, until I realized that even though they seem so silly to read now, that was my life. Full of drama, love, hate, anger and angst! What I thought was the complete and utter end of my life I laugh about now. How silly was I?
It basically comes down to what is important today, will not necessarily be important tomorrow."

"event","What is a Child and Youth Worker

Somewhere in adulthood there occurs an unfortunate stage in life known as Child and Youth Worker--a creature undefined by Psychologists, misunderstood by supervisors, worshipped by children, either admired or hated by parents and unheard by the rest of society.

&nbsp;A Child and Youth Worker is a rare combination of doctor, lawyer and a&nbsp;native indian chief. They are competent child psychologists, strict disciplinarians, with a twinkle in their eye, minister to all faiths with questions of their own. Child and Youth Workers are idols, with their heads in the clouds and their feet in the mud from yesterdays rain. They are humourists in crisis, a doctor in an emergency, a leader and entertainer.

&nbsp;While working in a residential treatment residence, a Child and Youth Worker is expected to repair 10 years of damage to Tommy, make Jerry into a man, rehabilitate Lisa, allow Lucy to be an individual and help John adjust to the group. Child and Youth Workers are expected to lead youth in fun and adventure....even with their headaches. To teach indigenous activities...even when they cannot spell the word. To guide youth in social adjustments....when they have just found theirs; and to ensure everyones safety...all while doing logs, drives, telephone calls and councelling another youth.

For all this, a Child and Youth Worker is paid enough to buy gas for their vehicle, food for their bellies, some Tylenol and to live on their nights off. You wonder how they can stand the pace and pressure. You wonder if they really know how much they are worth. And somehow you realize you can never pay them enough, when they leave at the end of their 18 hour shift and say see you in the morning.

Darren and i are back together, which makes me VERY happy...
he just needed his space, which i can understand.. so we are going to just work on seeing eachother only once a week and not bother to try otherwise.. it seems to be working better, and the communication is better too... hell maybe this one will be in&nbsp; for the long hall... you never know.

School sucks... i'll leave it at that.

oh and does any one know if a break is ending a realationship or just putting it on hold.... because if it was just on hold do i count the days? because if so, darren and i will be dating for almost 3 months.. if the break counts as a break up than we have been dating only for a few weeks.. i the break counts as just a break then we have only been dating for 2 months... how does it work?? any one?
ugh
why does my life have to be so fucking complicated??
have fun with life

Well this entire conversation backfired, instead of reaching out and conversing and working things out and becomming closer to eachother, we are now on a ""break"" as he feels ""things are ready for the next step in our relationship"" but he is ""not ready.""<br />I don't even know what to think of all this, what have&nbsp;I dont wrong in this relationship? How can you even ask me to not contact you for a few weeks and see if our relationship problems will work out? I really don't understand. I am so confused and hurt and heartbroken.

"event","If it makes you less sad 
I will die by your hand 
I hope you find out what you want 
I already know what I am 
And if it makes you less sad 
We'll start talking again 
And you can tell me how vile 
I already know that I am 
I'll grow old 
Start acting my age 
I'll be a brand new day 
In a life that you hate 
A crown of gold 
A heart that's harder than stone 
And it hurts a whole lot 
But it's missed when it's gone 
Call me a safe bet 
But I'm betting I'm not 
I'm glad that you can forgive 
I'm only hoping as time goes 
That you can forget 
If it makes you less sad 
I'll move out of the state 
You can keep to yourself 
I'll keep out of your way 
And if it makes you less sad 
I'll take your pictures all down 
Every picture you paint 
I will paint myself out 
It's cold as a tomb 
And it's dark in your room 
When I sneak to your bed 
To pour salt in your wounds 
So call it quits 
Or get a grip 
You say you wanted a solution 
You just wanted to be missed 
Call me a safe bet 
I'm betting I'm not 
I'm glad that you can forgive 
I'm only hoping as time goes 
You can forget 
(So you can forget) 
(You can forget) 
You are calm and reposed 
It lets your beauty unfold 
Pale white like the skin stretched over your bones 
Spring keeps you ever close 
You are second hand smoke 
You are so fragile and thin 
Standing trial for your sins 
Holding onto yourself the best you can 
You are the smell before rain 
You are the blood in my veins 
Call me a safe bet 
I'm betting I'm not 
I'm glad that you can forgive 
I'm only hoping as time goes 
You can forget


wow, i feel emo right now.. and yet listening to all this and letting me relate to everything some how hleps. The power of music i guess. 
please make everything better
please make everything okay again
please"

"event","oh man
so I guess this is time to update, since I never update.
I have decided that i am a horable reched person who deserves to be shot. -nods-

November Rain 

When I look into your eyes 
I can see a love restrained 
But darlin' when I hold you 
Don't you know I feel the same 

'Cause nothin' lasts forever 
And we both know hearts can change 
And it's hard to hold a candle 
In the cold November rain 

We've been through this auch a long long time 
Just tryin' to kill the pain 

But lovers always come and lovers always go 
An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today 
Walking away 

If we could take the time 
to lay it on the line 
I could rest my head 
Just knowin' that you were mine 
All mine 
So if you want to love me 
then darlin' don't refrain 
Or I'll just end up walkin' 
In the cold November rain 

Do you need some time...on your own 
Do you need some time...all alone 
Everybody needs some time... 
on their own 
Don't you know you need some time...all alone 

I know it's hard to keep an open heart 
When even friends seem out to harm you 
But if you could heal a broken heart 
Wouldn't time be out to charm you 

Sometimes I need some time... on my own 
Sometimes I need some time... all alone 
Everybody needs some time... on their own 
Don't you know you need some time...all alone 

And when your fears subside 
And shadows still remain 
I know that you can love me 
When there's no one left to blame 
So never mind the darkness 
We still can find a way 
'Cause nothin' lasts forever 
Even cold November rain 

Don't ya think that you need somebody 
Don't ya think that you need someone 
Everybody needs somebody 
You're not the only one 
You're not the only one 

I like you and I know you like me too. But you are off limits, marital problems or not. I don't want to have to be held responsible for destroying that.
You dont want me anyways, we come from different social classes, I'm not like you...
I dont care if you would buy me anything I ever wanted or needed. I dont care if you could make Alex and I happy, make us financially stable. I like you for who you are, it's not supposed to be this way. Why does it have to be this way.."

My god that seems like a million years ago... it kinda makes you wanna cry.
I feel old.

I was in a cab last week and I was told by the cab driver that i ""was long over due for a baby.""

She is right, I am long over due, I miss the baby smell and cuddles, and even the barf.
Unfortunately having another right now will just be moronic.

So I guess here is the real point of this post
HAPPY 4th BIRTHDAY ALEX!!! 
I hope you have a good one :)"

"event","its 9:00 on a friday night... and yet im sitting here in my bath robe-alone
i was willing to get a sitter
i just wanted to be with you
wake up beside you
smell you 
touch you
does what i want not matter
am i ever going to find some one who will just love me>
and im not saying that Adrian doesnt love me... although im  pretty sure he doesnt. i know he likes me and i like him 
when asked he says he doesnt want a relationship bc of his job and he doesnt know when or if or where he will be posted and its not fair to me or him or alex.
when asked he says its just the two of us but i shouldnt feel boggled down and i can still do as i wish... meaning sleep around with other guys
i have now been with 4 guys.
4 fucking guys and that number discusts me
i want to settle down
i want a realtionship, some one i can confide in, some one i can wake up beside every morning
i want some one who is willing to accept responsibility and is willing to take on alex
and Adrian is willing to take on alex and is willing to be there to confide in but what about the rest
intamicy is just such a small portion of the picture
and yes sex is nice
but i just want more
typical me
always wanting more
how can i snag this guy
make him understand with out pushing him away
how do i keep him
boyfriend girlfriend status is so lame and yet i crave it
i want to be able to eat breakfast with my friends and say
OMG you know what my boyfrined and i did last night
and this is so fucking pathetic
and maybe he is laying off of me bc im not on any form or birthcontrol
i see my doctor this thursday
Adrian makes me happy
he really does
but i just dont want to be ignored any more
i just want to be loved
god this is pathetic"

"event","Adrian and i are still seeing each other.. if you can really even call it seeing each other.. Every one keeps calling him my boyfriend but we only really get together to cuddle or to have sex, and right now i guess I'm ok with that. When i am with him its just him and me- no one else and its nice to be the center of attention. I would really like more though. When i asked him about wheather or not we are boyfriend or girlfrind he gave me this HUGE explanation on how he doesnt know if it has come to that or not and that he doesnt want to but me and himself into that ""trivial"" word because of his job and because he could be placed in ottawa tomorrow for all he knows and he doesnt want to do that to me or alex. stupid army job :(
i got him a funny valentines day card that i meant to give to him today but i forgot to. I really wish he would like to do something for v day and it kinda makes me sad that he doesnt want to. I usually boycott this god forsaken day of love and crap maybe he does too. iuno maybe i was just expecting too much... i mean we have only been ""seeing"" each other for what like two weeks on wednesday???
i guess this just makes me sad inside. he is always so busy with work it almost seems as though he is ignoring me even though i know he isnt bc he is just busy. 
i just want a fucking relationship 
even for just a little while"

"event","so i met up with Geo today after school and yes i know the whole bla bla bla's about meeting a dude online crap... but im still alive. I had fun he brought me a present- a pack of smokes- and i took him to Saigon and that was fun and then we went to caylee's and keelah's work to buy guitar strings. i guess i just kinda expected more. online we had instant chemestry and it was just weird and ackward in person. i was actually shy around him i have no idea what has gotten into me... :S
he decided to go over kill on talking, im not sure if he is just chatty or if he was doing it because he was nervous or if he was making up for my lack of taking.
but because his break lights are out he had to get home before dark i had him drop me off at thee kingston ctr. i gave him a hug and told him i had a great time... and then he KISSED me... my insides went all gooshy inside.
i have no idea what i am feeling
how do i fail so at boys :(

 

Hands Down  
 
 Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep, this air is blessed, you share with me
This night is wild, so calm and dull, these hearts they race from self control
Your legs are smooth, as they graze mine, we're doing fine, we're doing nothing at all

My hopes are so high, that your kiss might kill me.
So won't you kill me, so I die happy?
My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury,
Or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.

The words are hushed lets not get busted, just lay entwined here, undiscovered
Safe from the earth and all the stupid questions...
""Hey did you get some?"" Man, that is so dumb.
Stay quiet, stay near, stay close they can't hear, so we can get some

Hands down this is the best day I ever remember
I'll always remember the sound of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights
The scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers
And the time on the clock when we realized it's so late
And this walk that we shared together
The streets were wet, and the gate was locked so I jumped it, and let you in
And you stood at the door with your hands on my waist
And you kissed me like you meant it
And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it, that you meant it"

Who would have thought that one person could cause so much emotion and angst. Just once I would love to wake up and have the house cleaned and the dishes done. Just once I would like to have a good day. Go out, have fun maybe even get a boyfriend. But as we all know that is never going to happen. I just want to be happy, just for a little while..."

"event","Wish You Were Here - Pink Floyd

So, so you think you can tell 
Heaven from Hell, 
Blue skys from pain. 
Can you tell a green field 
From a cold steel rail? 
A smile from a veil? 
Do you think you can tell? 

And did they get you to trade 
Your heros for ghosts? 
Hot ashes for trees? 
Hot air for a cool breeze? 
Cold comfort for change? 
And did you exchange 
A walk on part in the war 
For a lead role in a cage? 

How I wish, how I wish you were here. 
We're just two lost souls 
Swimming in a fish bowl, 
Year after year, 
Running over the same old ground. 
What have we found? 
The same old fears. 
Wish you were here. 

doesn't this song make you wan to cral into a nice warm bed and cry
cry for anything and everything.
-how i wish, how i wish you were here-
i wan to learn how to play this song, i want to play it and sing it until i start to sob uncontrolably and then start all over again
i dont want to start over
i dont want to make new friends
i dont want to forget
i dont wan to move on, move on with out you
im sorry for not being a better friend and for getting mad over stupid things
and now we all part our seperate ways- wheather it be college, university or another dreadful year at the ""ridge""
some one please call me
any one call me
let me know what is up and if you are ok
and who is in your life and let me in on all the juicy gossip
just once a week
or even every other week
this has been the lonelyest summer in the face of the planet, and im not sure if it is me secluding my self and being too stuborn to call or if it is you(s) being too busy to call me.
just some time let me know that your alive
and want to call me and maybe even hang out
like old times like you want to, like its not a chore
-Year after year, Running over the same old ground. What have we found? 
The same old fears. Wish you were here.-
kee if you read this or hear about it
remember when we went to montreal for caylees b day?
and you asked me what i was afraid of, what my bigest fear is and i answered i dont play childish games
im sorry
im afraid of being forgotten, being lost forever and being lonely
and yet by shoving every one off so that i wont get hurt just does the exact thing i am afraid of.
im so sorry
plaese dont forget me

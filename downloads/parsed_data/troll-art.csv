"event","As it would seem, what may be my only vacation for this year begins tomorrow. To keep myself from stressing about this week's sketches, I've opted to upload one of my recent completed projects, 'Daily Addictions'. This was my first experiment in process art, and thus a bit out of my style, but it called to my love of beautiful papers.

 The actual process involved treating my paper with coffee, food oils, heat, vodka, and cigarettes. I'm more proud of the paper than the images, so at a later date I'd love to continue with this process. I'd really love more ideas on what images I could use, or different spins on these. My main problem I ran into involved all my pens clogging up because of the oiled paper, so I didn't push things as far as I would have liked. And, if you couldn't guess, the piece was about the relationship between the objects displayed and the process of the paper.

No excuses this time, though. Just two little sketches I thuroughly enjoyed working on this week. 

<lj-cut text=""To the MOON!"">

Okay. No moon. Just fish. And chickens. And Camerons.

I've got an obsession with papers, and lately, I've just been fooling around with colored mediums vs. colored papers. This is white verithin prismacolor pencil on colored craft paper. Say hello to Petey the fish's portrait!

Bwahahaha! All I have to say is Cameron said he wanted to see more involving the crazy chickens. So... he got it. Up close and personal. Cheap gouache, prisma pencils, and ink.

This is the final take on a bookcover illustration, only the image is my work, the cover's text and format was a template used for the entire class once our images were complete. The assignment's guidelines asked for an image influenced by Poe's work and done entirely in chalk pastels (and cleanup in photoshop). My concept started with influences from <i>The Masque of the Red Death</i> and <i>The Cask of Amontillado</i>, although the final idea didn't necessarily represent anything in particular. This scan is quite bad, but it was the best I could manage for right now, and in general I wasn't terribly proud of my finished work. Pastels tend to frustrate me, and I have an intense loathing of anything with a chalky texture. 

But who knows... I learned a good bit about the medium and I'd like to do another pastel piece in the future. </lj-cut>"

"event","Ah, finally, sketches are here! Only four, yet again. I've gotten out of the habit of using my sketchbook over the summer so it's going to be another week or two before I can start updating with new sketches of the week. 

<lj-cut text=""Onward!"">
These first two were studies for a painting final where one draws a bunch of words out of a hat and has to illustrate them. As per usual with this type of assignment, my fellow classmates were unimaginative with their words and thus I had to cobble together something completely random. It resulted in something along the lines of a World of Warcraft troll with mechanical wings. Anyway, this gives a general idea of where I start when I'm working on the piece.

And here we have my failed attempt at last week's illustration friday, which I only colored just today. It's pen, watercolor, and colored pencil on bristol, and the theme somehow traveled from ""rain"" to ""rain of toast killing chickens!""

I honestly don't know why.

And lastly, something that's not actually a sketch... this is the first two layers of a self-portrait that will mimic the style of Brian Froud, one of my all-time favorite artists. Thus far I've sketched a basic outline of the setup, and covered that with a very thin coat of acylic which both seals the board from absorbing color permanently and creates my highlight color. Then, I've layered over a darker wash of watercolor which I'm now in the process of removing in the highlighted areas.

I've found that being in school is great for my productivity, what with assignments and side projects and the always possible death of one's grades and ensuing kicking of my ass by the parental units who fund said schooling experience. However, I'm not in school right now and I'm stuggling to find ways to keep myself productive in my art. So, until I find the Great And Mighty Answer to this delimma, I'm going to FOOL YOU ALL and just make you <i>think</i> I'm productive by creating Sketchbook Tuesdays.

I don't think I'm done here, yet. Something is definitely missing though I'm not entirely sure what. The eye color needs to pick up the purples and needs a highlight, and the hair could use some work. 
 
As to process, this is acrylic on illustration board, then a layer or watercolor, a wash of oil paint, and it was finished with acrylic and colored pencils."

I'm not terribly thrilled with it. I was having trouble getting the images to where I wanted them, and then when I scanned the image it completely washed out the entire piece. This is just an attempt at restoring the original color, and it didn't go terribly well. The original idea was really fun, though. I like working with lots of layers of color and just playing with my materials, so this is one I'll probably revisit sometime soon. I'd love to hear opinions on what I could have added or worked on, because this one just left me feeling utterly unfulfilled and aggrivated. As for particulars, this is Windsor and Newton watercolor with Prismacolor Colored Pencils layered over top on Strathmore illustration board, and touch-ups were done it photoshop.

I know it's terribly basic, but I'm only now getting my 'legs' for illustration, and I've been fumbling about with Photoshop which has only been going... interestingly. I started out with a basic black ink outline, filled in the color with prismacolor colored pencils, and tooled around with the background in Photoshop. All in all, it's about an hour or less worth of work and worthy of the theme ""simple.""

On a random side note, I'm addicted to naming everything, so for anyone wanting to indulge in my mini-psychosis -- the Koala's name is Bartleby and the Turtle is Jacob. They wage a war for pie, which is a noble endeavor. Atleast, I like to think so."

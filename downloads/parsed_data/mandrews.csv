First the RAs started talking to me and then I felt sick so I went into the bathroom and puked.  It went downhill from there.  The RAs call security who in turn called the police, who arrested me.  I then got to spend the night in jail as well as most of Saturday wondering if my so called friends were really going to come bail me out.  Finally at around 5 or maybe later I get bailed out, this is after they accidentally release the wrong guy thinking he is me.  Talk about screw up!!!  Then as we are walking out my so called friends are like yeah so you owe us $100 plus 25 for the inconvenience.  Some friends huh?  Just makes me wanna scream...."

Saturday I got the staples removed from my head and I took my brother snow boarding with Brian and Joel...   That's was fun and I got to see Karl and Lindsay that night so it made it even better.  Sunday I went to church,  I really miss that church.  After church we went home and Karl came over and ate steaks with us,  yummy (that kid is the shit)  oh yeah I got to see a lot of my friends at church. that was really cool.  then I drove back up to school which really sucked.  the last 150 miles were a blizzard.  most of the time I couldn't see the lines of the road or the edges and there were some points when I couldn't see the front of my car.  Talk about stressful.  I was kinda SCARED.  any way now I am back up at school and I remember how much I hate this place......"

"event","Well today I was introduced to this girl that I have had my eyes on but never had the balls to talk to.  Her name is Meghan. She is really nice, fun, has a good sense of humor, and as a bonus she is beautiful.  Tonight was college night at the local club, after she got dressed she IMed me and said that I should see her, so I told her to come over, she was here in like 1 minute.  She was looking hot!  She asked me to go to the club but I told her I had a lot of homework to do and she and she was like ""awww that's too bad""  she asked me to go like 2 or 3 more times and I finally I'm like I can't pass this up.  So I went.  I had the best time so far this year, the club was so fun.  We danced together all night.  I was so happy!  So the club closed and I drove her back to school, and walked her to her room.  She gave me the little tour of her room and we said good night.  At this point I kissed her she returned, and I left.  I'm not sure if I should have kissed her though.  I don't know if maybe I went too fast or anything, I hope I didn't mess it up between us because she is a really awesome girl.  I don't know if she is going to want to hang out again or if I messed it up. I sure hope I didn't!"

I really hate that's place but hate isn't a strong enough word to describe my feelings.  I leave for LSSU on Sunday and its only Friday night but still the thought that returning to the place is so close makes me wanna cry.  I honestly don't even know why I went there anymore.  I don't wanna go back but my parents say I have to finish this semester.  And I know that they are going to say the same one for next year...   there are only 3 years left stick with it.  I would rather be a gas station attendant the rest of my life than do that ( no offense to gas station attendants, the job is pretty damn important).  No one understands my feelings and I don't know how to express them to my parents.  Just the thought of going back there makes my eyes tear up.  I think this is  one of the first things that I have ever really hated.  Its so hard.  Everyone at school thinks I am crazy,  I guess it may be better that way though at least they don't mess with me.  I just don't know anymore.  I will never be good enough for my parents so I don't even see the point anymore."

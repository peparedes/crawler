"event","<p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">And no, that's not a new title for one of my scripts. That there be the amount of time I've been away from this website. Wow-ee has shit changed. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Um, still working in the same shit-hole. Still living in the same shit-hole. Still have the same stellar outlook on life. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">So, all-in-all, I guess much hasn't changed. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Except that it has.  Oh boy has it. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Jealous girlfriends, writing gigs, new people in my life that have me questioning things that I don't like to question. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Let's start with jealous girlfriends. That's always fun.
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">My best friend is a guy. We've been friends since high school. Going on for ... six years now I believe.  He and his girlfriend (let's call her Lisa) have been going out for 4 years. Now I&rsquo;ve tried to make nice with Lisa and my friend whenever we&rsquo;ve hung out. I&rsquo;ve talked to her , shared common interests, yadda yadda yadda. And, also, made no attempt to &lsquo;steal her boyfriend&rsquo;.  No flirting with him, no touching him, again NO attempt to steal him. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">So, color me surprised when the three of us hanging out started to become a problem three years into their relationship. We&rsquo;ve been on-set making movies together and have been fine. Then, out of nowhere my friend started to have to choose who he was going to hang out with. I never, nor would I ever have him, choose to hang out with either me or her. That&rsquo;s not classy at all. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">This goes on for a while, the choosing. I also found out in that time that many of my friends didn&rsquo;t like hanging out with her  to begin with(I had a little yay moment in finding that out, not gonna lie). Then she started saying shit behind my back about me. That doesn&rsquo;t fly with me, not one bit. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Then I get a message from her, saying she wants to get coffee and talk about our situation. She goes on into saying how this got out of hand and how she didn&rsquo;t make him choose sides either, so I was a little more than confused. At that point, yeah I wanted to find out what happened between all of us.  Cause I think my friend actually had something to do with it. I also think that miscommunication was a factor&hellip; as it always is. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Then life happened, I lived mine, vice versa, and so I forget about ever meeting up with her. And finally, I get over it. I also realize that I don&rsquo;t really want to even be her friend. Too much effort. Friends should click, we didn&rsquo;t I guess. I also start to remember what kind of person she is. She&rsquo;s kind of awful. She picks on my friend in front of all his friends, and picks fights with him while we&rsquo;re on movie sets. Mind you, that&rsquo;s our work. So it&rsquo;s not cool for her to start lover&rsquo;s quarrels on a work site. Also, she&rsquo;s really loud and opinionated. Which is fine, but when she&rsquo;d dead-set on something, she&rsquo;ll fight with you and fight with you to see her point. Most of the time, I don&rsquo;t give a shit. You&rsquo;re talking to a Liberal here. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Anyways.
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Then I hear that they break up. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Relief. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">&hellip;
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">For a brief second, cause I guess now they&rsquo;re back together. My friend has yet to confirm this. I think he&rsquo;s scared to tell me, which is fucked up. We&rsquo;re best friends, he shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to tell me that he&rsquo;s back together with the girlfriend who hates me. Which the hatred is kind of mutual now I suppose.  
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">And I also can&rsquo;t help but think that it&rsquo;s unfair to her to be in that relationship again. He&rsquo;s not planning on moving in with her. Where is that relationship going? We&rsquo;re in our twenties now, people all around us are having kids, getting married, getting careers, and moving in with their partner. (yikes that makes me depressed to even think about, but hey, change the subject yeah?)
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">He and I have talked about moving to LA for a while now. We might even have jobs lined up and everything. So that&rsquo;s a doomed relationship. And if you know that, and you willingly step back into it, then that&rsquo;s just messed up on so many levels. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Off topic, but who thinks that &ldquo;Daybreakers&rdquo; is going to be the movie that brings back kick ass vampires and not wimpy little teen glowing pretty vampires? I certainly do hope so. I&rsquo;m sick of twi-tards. Also, that Placebo song in the preview has me interested. Love me some Placebo in the morning &hellip; and at night. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Anyways, I&rsquo;m over jealous weird people. She has no reason to be jealous of me. I have no romantic feelings for him. And I never will. Never. I know something about myself that nobody does, and probably won&rsquo;t know until I get the balls to actually admit it. So &hellip; yeah. Vague, I know, but maybe you&rsquo;ll be able to decipher what that means. And if you do, then you&rsquo;re brilliant, or I&rsquo;m just more obvious that I realize. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">So&hellip; topic change.
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">I&rsquo;m writing. I wrote a couple of scripts for some film kids. Has me excited, but also strangely depressed. I want to hope that I&rsquo;m good, but can&rsquo;t help but wonder if I&rsquo;ll ever be as good as I hope. If that makes any sense&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been on this strange emotional roller coaster lately about different things. My writing being one of them. I&rsquo;m self-taught, which is awesome to brag about if I&rsquo;m a great writer, but lame if I&rsquo;m shit. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">So about this emotional roller coaster. I keep thinking that maybe going to a therapist would help. I don&rsquo;t talk about my feelings. Ever. Not to my friends, not to my parents. I&rsquo;m just not an open person. Even what I write here isn&rsquo;t the extent of my dilemmas in life. Which is sad. I don&rsquo;t even know how to go about getting a therapist. And to top it all off, I don&rsquo;t have the money to pay one. So, I lie in bed at night, stare at the ceiling for an hour and whisper to the walls what&rsquo;s going on in my life. Sometimes it helps, other times it makes me even more depressed than when I say nothing. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">I get a little sad too when I think about the fact that I&rsquo;m not seeing anyone. Relationships make me claustrophobic, and being alone makes me depressed. I really do think I have problems. Or, it could be that I just haven&rsquo;t found &lsquo;the one&rsquo;. But I&rsquo;m not much of a romantic to believe that bull-crap that Valentine&rsquo;s Day feeds us along with its chalky candy. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">And I think I am now beginning to realize why it&rsquo;s been 44 weeks since I&rsquo;ve posted anything on here. I have epitome&rsquo;s that don&rsquo;t amount to any action being taken, and it just ends up driving me mad. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">I need to immerse myself in my writing is what I need to do. Get some good tune-age and just suffocate myself in paper and fictional characters where none of this matters. And tequila or whiskey. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Or a good lay. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">I&rsquo;m praying for the latter. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Anyways, I&rsquo;m teaching myself French, so&hellip;

</span></p><span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Au Revoir.</span>
 
<span style=""font-size: 9pt"">Hey, I never said I was any good. </span>

"event","So I'm bored.&nbsp; I&nbsp;had a couple of hours to kill before work (now only one)&nbsp;so I&nbsp;decided to revisit some sites I&nbsp;haven't seen in a while. This is one of em. 

Let's see ... what has happened in the past many months since my last post?&nbsp; 

-Still working in the same restaurant 
-Completed two more movies, and am in the process of making another one 
-Bought an electric/acoustic Washburn guitar, and an acoustic Epiphone guitar.&nbsp; They sure are purty pa. 
-Have dated ... no one. Wow that's a record.&nbsp; I'm loving the single life right now ... sometimes. :P 

Please god let me think of something else interesting .... for my own sake ... 

Oh!&nbsp;I&nbsp;might be moving to LA&nbsp;soon with a good friend of mine.&nbsp; He might get accepted to USC&nbsp;and if he does, then he's making me tag along.&nbsp; That would be freaking awesome.&nbsp; That's where my career's at, so I'm pumped.&nbsp; To become a future screenwriter, I&nbsp;must start at the bottom.&nbsp; Getting coffee?&nbsp;No problem Mr. Spielberg!&nbsp; Okay that's dreaming a little too big ...&nbsp; 

&quot;I'm Yours&quot;&nbsp;by Jason&nbsp;Mraz came on. I&nbsp;LOVE&nbsp;this song.&nbsp; Yes, random.&nbsp;&nbsp;There will&nbsp;be many of those randomness things in my posts. 

So yeah, LA would be an exciting turnaround.&nbsp; Might&nbsp;open up some dating possibilities.&nbsp; I&nbsp;seem to be making a record out of dating my coworkers which is no bueno.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three is the&nbsp;number I'm&nbsp;up to.&nbsp;Fourth one is in the works. ;)&nbsp;haha&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all at once!&nbsp;Oh god no.&nbsp; At different points in time. I'm&nbsp;no hussy.&nbsp; 

The guy I'm working&nbsp;on right now ... wow that sounds horrible. Anyways, he's cute, we get along, we insult each other in the way that&nbsp;we know we don't mean any harm we're just having fun, and we each have great comebacks.&nbsp;I&nbsp;love that. Haha&nbsp;yeah I'm weird.&nbsp; The sucky thing is, I&nbsp;don't think I'm fixed yet.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;problem which keeping and maintaining relationships.&nbsp; Because I&nbsp;simply just don't like them.&nbsp; I&nbsp;feel claustrophobic, suffocated, and trapped. I&nbsp;hate having to call and see someone all the time.&nbsp; And I'm a real sucky girlfriend.&nbsp; I'm a great friend, so it's strange to me that I&nbsp;would be such a bad girlfriend.&nbsp; I&nbsp;told my best friend these things and he just thinks I&nbsp;haven't met the right person.&nbsp; And he's definitely right, cause about 90% of the guys I've been with are all jerks.&nbsp; I&nbsp;either have strong feelings for them because of their personality, or because I&quot;m sexually attracted to them, never at the same time have both happened.&nbsp; 

The funny thing is too, is that I&nbsp;love romantic novels.&nbsp; Nicholas Sparks books. And I&nbsp;love Pride and Prejudice.&nbsp; So I don't think it's because I'm not girly enough (cause I'm not girly at all really ..), I&nbsp;just don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I&nbsp;sooo did not plan on writing all this when I&nbsp;started. Just kind of came out.&nbsp; (That's what she said) 

Maybe I'm destined to be an old maid, much like Lizzy was before she met her Mr. Darcy.&nbsp; Career first is probably how it's going to be.&nbsp; And if I'm famous as a screenwriter, then so be it.&nbsp; The fortune cookie did say that my future contained great success and wealth.&nbsp; Too bad it failed to mention whether or not I'd be happy.&nbsp; Damn you fortune cookie and your mixed signals! 

So, lighter stuff.&nbsp; I'm listening to the new Lily Allen and loving it.&nbsp; Can't wait till that album comes out.&nbsp; I&nbsp;also can't wait to buy Schuyler Fisk's new one.&nbsp; That song she does with Joshua Radin &quot;Paperweight&quot;&nbsp;I&nbsp;believe, is amazing.&nbsp; 
Also, buy Lisa Hannigan's new album, its grrr-eat.&nbsp; She used to sing with Damien Rice (and she will be missed singing duets with him)&nbsp;but now has a solo album and I&nbsp;love it.&nbsp; It's my creativity music along with some Iron and Wine.&nbsp; 

Production for my movie starts this Thursday!&nbsp;I'm so excited. We're filming in LA ... so here's to hoping that all goes well.&nbsp; Black and white movie shot on Super 8.&nbsp; So it's going to look like an older film.&nbsp; No dialogue, but we got a great composer for the music, so I'm pumped.&nbsp; It's for a festival in march.&nbsp; My fourth movie.&nbsp; I&nbsp;still can't believe that I&nbsp;got mixed up in the crazy life of making movies.&nbsp; It's all surreal. 

I'm just so lucky to have a friend who knows how to operate cameras and owns such instruments, and knows how to edit to boot.&nbsp; He's my best friend and I'm so grateful to have him in my life. 

Okay, enough of mushy.&nbsp; 

I'm hoping after this film, I&nbsp;can write a script without having to direct it.&nbsp; I'm no Director.&nbsp; I'm finding that out more and more as I&nbsp;go along.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have a vision yeah, but I'm horrible at conveying it to others.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have a vision when I&nbsp;write and that's what inspires me to write, but actually having to storyboard and direct the cameras movements?&nbsp;It's daunting.&nbsp; So, next project I&nbsp;do, I'm writing and handing it to someone.&nbsp; I&nbsp;may have a job writing a comedy for someone who's looking for a writer. I'll have to get back to him on that. 

I've never written a comedy before.&nbsp; The other shorts I've done are drama, horror, light comedy but that was because I&nbsp;was actually helping out a friend for Sundance, and this one starts out as a romantic movie, but turns dark.&nbsp; So I'm a very dark person I&quot;d say ...&nbsp;&nbsp; 

I'll try my hat at comedy though.&nbsp; People say I'm funny. I&nbsp;don't see it, but whatevs. I&nbsp;love to laugh, and TRY&nbsp;and make other people laugh, but I&nbsp;don't really think I&quot;m all too funny.&nbsp; I'm more sarcastic if anything.&nbsp; 

I&nbsp;have about 45 minutes to go before I&nbsp;gotta dry and my hair and hit the road, so I must be off.&nbsp; This was a looong post, but it was overdue I&nbsp;s'pose. 

Until next time fellow Livejournal-ians."

"event","I'm bored. :P<br /><br /><br />The Big Read reckons that ""the average adult has only read 6 of the top 100 books they've printed."" <br />1) Look at the list and bold those you have read. <br />2) Italicize those you intend to read. <br />3) Underline the books you LOVE. <br />4) Reprint this list in your own LJ so we can try and track down these people who haven't read 6 and force books upon them ;-) <br /><br /><br /><br /><u>1 <strong>Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen</strong></u> - Favorite book of all time. <br />2 The Lord of the Rings - JRR Tolkien - Eh, I have all of the books cause of my brother, I just havn't read them yet. <br />3 <strong>Jane Eyre - Charlotte Bronte</strong> - Slow, but interesting. A forced upon me book in school. <br /><u>4 </u><strong><u>Harry Potter series - JK Rowling</u> - </strong>Great books. :P<br />5 <strong>To Kill a Mockingbird - Harper Lee</strong> - This was also a forced upon me book but it was good. <br />6 The Bible -<br />7 Wuthering Heights - Emily Bronte <br /><em>8 Nineteen Eighty Four</em> - George Orwell <br />9 His Dark Materials - Philip Pullman <br /><strong>10 Great Expectations - Charles Dickens</strong>&nbsp; - Long book, but good.

"event","Why do exes have to continiously tell you how happy they are in their new relationship? 

I was talking to my ex and I casually ask him how he's been doing. Haven't talked to him in a while and he's a really good guy, so I thought I might give him a shout. He went on into telling me that he was looking for a new car and then he mentions how he's feeling crappy because his new girlfriend is leaving for ... some distant country that I can't remember the name of. I think it might've been in Italy. 

I took a little pity on him and told him that it must be hard cause he said she'd be gone for about a month. I'll admit that that IS going to be really hard for him, for anyone actually.  But then he went on into saying how happy he is when he's with her and how they call each other every day and how they see each other all the time. And how they eat pie off each other ... okay I made up that last part, but he might as well have said it. 

That guy from Maroon 5 and Rhianna look way hot together. (I'm watching VHI videos) 

Then I told him that it'd be a true test of the relationship, if he can hold out and still love her when she comes back. Then he said that it's not even that. That he's so in love with her, that he knows he's going to continue loving her when she comes back. All in all, he's saying that she might be 'the one'. 

Why do I sound so bitter you ask?  This guy is kind of like the Ross to my Rachel.  We've been together twice. Once when we were bull headed kids in High School, and then again after.  We started hanging out a lot again and then one night at the beach, we just kissed.  It was actually really romantic, and I'm not usually a mushy gushy girl.  He's the first guy that I told ""I love you"" to. It didn't work the second time because I kind of have commitment problems. I'm really independent. 

I don't know, I guess I kind of always thought we'd end up together in the end though. 

I need to find a Joey I s'pose.

"event","Alicia has not spilled her guts in a while, so I thinks she feels the need to do so now.

And I will stop talking in the third person starting ... that last sentence...

Oookay. What's happening now? Just watching Dawn of the Dead alone in my living room, with lights semi-dim and I'm starting to regret that decision only because blood is everywhere and zombies are running loose.  Who am I kidding? I love it! 

Work has been ... adequate. It has inspired me to write a TV pilot, so that's good news. I'm surprised there isn't one out there already about the madness I have to deal with in a restaurant.

Zombie giving birth? Nar-sty. 

Off topic. 

Anyways. Yeah like I said, work has been grinding my ass real hard. (Get-yo-minds-outa-the-gutter) 

Boys-wise. Now THERE's an interesting topic.  

A few weeks ago my ex, Andrew, kept calling me, saying how we should ""hang out"" some time soon. I knew it was never going to happen, but I kept telling him ""yeah okay, maybe"".  Well I was feeling all kindsa desperate. Having one of those desperate ""I just want to be with someone/anyone moments"" .. yeah I hate those moments in life. So I thought about calling him up (against one of my good friends advice ... he hates my Andrew ... with good reason, major stoner druggie) But, I stayed strong and after running into him at Best Buy, he texted me saying again how we should hang out.  But this time I basically told him that I didn't see it happening.  He asked why of course, and I said that I heard some things about him that I didn't like and how I didn't want to get dragged into his shit again (I was a bad person with him, did some things that I regretted).  So he then said, ""Sorry for wasting your time"" and then I haven't heard from him since. 

End of that story.

Onto boy numero dos, Evan. 

This is a boy that I like a lot, but we're still in the awkward 'trying to be friends' stage.  One of my friends (who's also friends with him) told me that he's just looking for a friendship right now, and he wanted to see where things went, if they went anywhere. 

So I went to see Indiana Jones with him, and another ex of mine, and a couple of friends that I hadn't seen in a while. Yeah it was a litle weird with this other ex, only because when it came time to finding seats, he clearly says ""I'll let you two lovebirds sit next to each other"". So me and Evan end up sitting next to each other. He shared his popcorn with me. (that was my one tee hee moment of the night, and bare in mind, I'm NOT a 'tee hee' kind of girl, I just don't get that way).  He also drove me home.  We talked, still kind of awkward. (God I loathe awkwardness ... why does there have to be awkwardness? Why can't people just be themselves without giving a shit what other people think?) 

Welp, haven't heard from that boy since. In truth, I'm kind of sick of going out with wussy guys who don't take what they want. First boyfriend was a nice guy ... tooo nice. Second one was man candy who was a douchebag, third one was the agressive bad-boy which was kind of a turn on, fourth one was another wussy.  

I wash my hands of wussy-boys. 

Wow, I sound like kind of a bitch. I don't mean to be.

On another note, this girl at work has been flirting with me, or at least I think she is. She has a boyfriend, but she keeps telling me how it isn't working out with him and how much of a jerk he is. And I dunno, I'm good at reading people, especially when they're flirting. She's always brushing up against me though and mentioning how hot other girls are when they come in. Gotta say though, interesting when we work together. 


I just noticed that two people in Dawn of the Dead are in Wrong Turn. They play the couple that gets killed (not the first couple, the second couple). They're a couple in Dawn too. :P

Again, off topic. I can't stay on topic to save my life. 

No more relationship talk, or lack-there-of. 

In other news, school starts soon. Yay. I'm only taking an English class.  I have to petition for it. Boo. 

Oh yeah and my mom is going to be out of town for three days. Suh-weet. She specifically told me not to throw any parties ... hehe ... yeeeaaah, I think she kind of knows that the last time she went out of town I kind of threw a party.  A party that got waaay out of control. The evening ended around four with a round of strip beer pong. And that, folks, is the last time I had a drink. One bad experience, and it'll ruin it for ya. Don't get me wrong, it was a fun night, but people slept with people that they shouldn't have, people got cheated on (specifically me), people threw up where they shouldn't.  Yeaaah. Fun times. 


And on another note, THIS ^ is a reason why I don't do these kinds of posts ... I write waaay too much for someone to even be interested in readin this crap. But I needed to vent a little. So that being said, time to get back to reading crappy fiction.

Peace suckas!"

2: Selling a script.  Here's to hoping something gets accomplished this year as far as writing goes. I'm working on about five scripts now. All of which are completely different. And when I say different, I mean DIFFERENT.  I have two zombie scripts: One actual horror, the other a parody, two dramas with two very different arcs, and one dark comedy.  

Oh and I also was a PA on production of a movie recently. The movie is called ""Mind Travelers"" and it's directed by a published author. It was great, I learned a LOT on that set. We filmed from 8am to 12am. And my good friend was actually a camera operator, handling about 15,000 dollars worth of equipment, who knows, it could've been worth more. I don't know. :P 

And I'm also going to be his Art Designer for a short he's working on that's going to be entered in a DVX contest.

So thus far, I've worked on three movies, including my own which I Directed, Wrote, and Produced. Big things are happening for Alicia! 



3: Okay lets face it folks, TV has royally sucked lately ... Heroes is on hiatus and the only watchable program right now is House.  Well this fall....

That's right, Joss Whedon and Eliza Dushku are teaming up once again for a show called ""Dollhouse""   Now I'm a HUGE fan of Joss, the guy is just awesome.  But him AND Eliza?  That's just a match made in heaven right there.  I have no problem watching her for an hour. It comes Fall, and it's on Fox (I know, yuck), and I know you'll all watch it so that it stays on TV for a loooong time. 

Onto number 4:

Nuff said right there.  I had a HUGE crush on Harrison Ford when I was a kid.  Is that at all creepy? Haha I even dressed as Indy for Halloween in fifth grade.  I made the costume from scratch, and it was AWESOME. Had a groovy looking whip, a shruken head, a snazzy hat.   So yeah, I'm pretty jazzed for this movie.

Fuck yeah!!!!  Batman is my FAVORITE comic book hero.  I know, I'm a huge nerd, whatever. I went and saw Iron Man friday and when that trailer came on, I think I might've held my breath.  I am like ""opening night at midnight"" excited for this movie. I know I'll have to wait to see this with my dad though, cause he and I have this tradition where we see all those types of movies together. Oh yeah we went and saw all the RE movies, the batmans, Iron Man, a lot of the scary movies, together. That's cause I have pretty pathetic friends who don't like to be scared when seeing a movie. PANSYS! I thrive for scary movies. Zombie movies in particular.  Anyways, getting off track here ...

Speaking of zombie movies ....

I don't know if this is a straight to video or what, but can I just say ABOUT FREAKING TIME! I mean c'mon now! They have an animated Final Fantasy movie, why not Resident Evil!?  It'd be ten time scarier then the feature films ONLY because they can do so much more scary shit with animation than they can in real life.  So excited, that I can hardly contain myself.

Uh huh, another comic based movie. Never read the comic, but James and Angelina?  Uh huh, YEP I'm there. Plus I love me a good action movie. 


8: 

<lj-embed id=""19"" />

I'm that much of a nerd. I've said it before, but I don't think you all quite believe me yet.  This movie is supposed to be in between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith.  I'm there.


9: ""Nights in Rodanthe""   a book turned movie written by Nicholas Sparks, one of my favorite authors.   And yes, it's a TOTAL chick flick.  I can be girly sometimes ...


10: ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"".  I've read 'em all, so I'll see them all.  Plus, they only get better and better. This last one definitely being the best. 


11: ""Sin City"" WHENEVER it freaking decides to grace us with its presence! Jeez.  Funny thing though, I looked it up on IMDB and it said that Sin City 3 is coming out in '09 and Sin City 2 is coming out in '10.  Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller what do you have to say for yourselves? 


12: And finally ""Diary of the Dead"" on DVD.  Because I'm VERY interested to see which films they chose for the contest that overruled mine.  The winner of the contest is actually a very nice director though, I've had a chance to talk to him a couple of times. And I thought his film was great. Great music, acting, directing, make-up, and very clear picture. 



So, I think that might've been the longest post I've EVER done. Enjoy. Or not, whichever."

Umm when douchebag Erik cheated on me my with my cousin in my bed. Yep, I think that pretty much was it right there. It was party time at my house and EVERYONE was drunk off their asses, but that doesn't mean it was okay in any way for him to sleep with my cousin in my bed when I was about ten feet away in the other room. I should have known better than to date the mancandy. And get this, he texts me about a month later saying, ""Yeah so I slept with your cousin, but I was thinking of you."" 

Yuh-hea, can anyone say 'douche'?"

Being sick sucks! I just got over being sick and let me just say, staying home and not getting paid? Equals no fun for Alicia. 

One good thing I can say about it however, is I did acquire a sexy voice while being sick ... although that turned on me too when that sexy voice, grew into a not-quite-there-voice, which sounded somewhere between a moose mating call, and a cat in heat.  Quite bad. But in the words of Pheobe, ""I want my sexy voice back!"""

I already know my favorite super star .. I live with her, I AM her. Haha just kidding. Not thaat vain.  Ummmm  I would LOVE to meet Quentin Tarantino.  I just think he's brilliant, no matter how mad he seems.  I like the crazy types... The question I would ask him would have to be: ""How do I write a script as original and crazy as the ones that you have written?"""

My perfect world would be full of music.  Not in an annoying musical type way, but if I could listen to music whenever and wherever I wanted, well then I'd be one happy camper. Also, me not being sick would be perfect too. And maybe if I had a job as a kick ass spy ... hmmm"

Um lets see ... AWKARD SILENCE the ENTIRE night. I was getting ready to smash some brains in.  I tried being my usual hilarious self, but that wasn't happening for silent boy that I was with.  I didn't even bother seeing if a kiss goodnight was cool because .. well, he was shy too.  Not happening with me.  I'm a little crazy, and he knew me before so he should have been a little bit more comfortable.  Oh well."

It's called ""Rocha Productions"". Rocha is my last name and since people call me ""the Roach"" I decided to make this little opening.  Oh and while you're there, take a look at ""Before Dawn"" the zombie movie I made, although it's in pretty low quality, I'm still very proud of it."

Um I feel it does! I work at Lawry's Carvery in South Coast Plaza.  A) I feel like plankton in a sea of rich fish and B) I work at a restaurant, so I'm sure to get my head chewed off daily.  

I can't stand the bitchy people that come in with the attitude that they're better than me.  I work hard, damn hard, just to please them and some don't even have the decency to show a little compassion or appreciation towards me. I don't think it would kill them to at least say ""Thank you"".  And then we get the chronic complainers ... these people make just make me laugh (and not the good kind) because (forgive me) but they are just retarded. Just because they're not happy with their own lives doesn't mean they have to bring me down (who's only doing her job) with them.  

Sorry, I have a very frustrating job.  Never again am I working in the mall or a restaurant. Nuff said."

"event","So, in the past couple of weeks, these things have happened:

-still working at the job that I was totally intent on quitting.

-got in touch with a guy I used to work with using the good 'ol internet.

-got a job writing, directing, and producing a five minute short.

-got asked out by said guy that I used to work with.

-had some weird dreams about an ex before going out on a date with the guy.

-went out with the guy and realized that he is exactly like one of my exes (one of the few nice ones) which pisses me off.

-realized that I like the ""bad boys"". God what is wrong with me? The times I had the most fun were with guys that were completely wrong for me.

-had ANOTHER dream about my ex before I went out with the guy who's like another ex.

-and finally realized that I am indeed a horrible horrible person. 

So that's basically my past few weeks in a nut shell. The reason I'm a horrible horrible person? I'm leading this guy on, knowing that nothing is going to come from it because I really don't feel any spark for him.  He's SUCH a nice guy too.  That's the problem ... he's too nice.  I like bad, I'm bad, so in turn, I like bad. I feel free, liberated when I'm with people that are all wrong for me.

It's like, I'm sort of in control of my life, but when I'm with the bad guys, they take control and I like that.  I like not knowing what's going to come next.  Spontaneity, I live for spontaneity. The first guy I was with never heard of it.  Second guy I was with pulled me into the realm, but cheated on me and I found out that he was a douchebag. Third guy I was with was one of the most unique guys I've ever met, yet he was a druggie, and well, sista don't play that. 

I really need to start figuring shit out."

"event","Gah! I don't know what's going on. 

My ex showed up at my work last night. He came by unexpectedly as I was closing and so I told him that it would be a good chance for him to get his sketch books that he left in my back seat.  

So, I took a break from closing and we went to my car to get the sketch books.  Nothing happened, besides the fact that I was flirting the whole time.  Grrr... 

He left me for a stupid concert and got shit faced and vanished for days, never showing up for work, never calling me.  Then he comes back after a week and says ""Oh, sorry."" in the most not-sorry voice I've ever heard. 

But I still thought about him.  He is exactly like me, in all the right ways, the random thoughts, the bizarre questions, etc. I think I liked who I was with him.  He made me feel like I could do anything.  Some of my friends don't like him though, so if I went out with him again, it would only show how weak I am. 

And then at the end he says how sorry he was again and if he wanted to explain what happened more fully, and I said that we could go out sometime and he could tell me then.  So I gave him my number, and he's going to call ... maybe. 

I'm such an idiot.  I think it's only because I'm in a rut and I'm sick of being alone right now.  I've been single for about six months and I'm the type of person who likes being with someone but at the same time knows they're a horrible girlfriend.

Anyways, HAPPY NEW YEARS! I'm off to hang out with mi amigos."

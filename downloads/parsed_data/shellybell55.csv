"event","3 AM...good song by Matchbox 20. Also the time right now :-(

So lately my sleeping habits have been getting worse and worse. I don't quite know how to fix it. I just dont' get tired untill about 4 in the morning. See I think I may have found an answer to this problem for me and other people like me. 

OK...so here's the sure fire remedy...(I'm using me as an example).
So lately I've been getting tired at about 4 AM. I WISH I could go to sleep at 10 PM. I have found a solution to this problem. It's almost 4 AM right now in Dallas, TX. But in Kamchatka...it's almost 10. This solution is so obvious I can't believe I didn't think of it sooner. All I have to do to be able to go to sleep at 10 is move to Kamchatka. I tell ya, if it were a snake it would have bit me.

So while you guys were thinking (""WTF is she talking about"")...I was laughing at myself...'cause I know that I'm just cursed with horrible sleeping habits and I just need to suck it up and morph into a bat (again...just as realistic as moving to Kamchatka.) Oh...by the way...I don't honestly know where that is. 

Anywho...I've discovered that you can put pictures on this livejournal thing just like you can do on the yahoo picture sites. :-) I'll be putting my zoo pictures on there on either sunday or monday. 

In other news I think I may do the counselor thing for my church this summer at their youth camp. I think it'd be tons of fun. I just don't know if I'll have time with this Maymester I'm taking. Government...thanks to Nick it's gonna be a blow off class 'cause this professor is apparently a freakin push over. Yay for old senile people *smiles*

I guess I should stop typing now and lay down.

Random self fact: So I CANNOT fall asleep without some sort of music playing. For the past couple of months it's been (get ready for this)..........The theme song from ""The Neverending Story"". 

.....that's stellar

"event","So w0w...today was a blast. Me and Darci went to the zoo today. It was soo much fun. We got to see the coolest animals...and a one eyed chita...lol. I think the big cats were my favorite though...those and the elephants and giraffes. We agreed that we're gonna be the official players with the animals...haha. There were seriously like a million little kids there today though. Man...that was good (pictures will be posted when I get them.) 

Then as soon as we got back I had to head up to class which was OK. Me and Britt went and got gelato over at Paciugos afterwords. *YUMM*

Ahhh...today was a lott of fun...but I'm totally exhausted...so I'm done

"event","Today...w0weey today. Where to begin. OK here it goes. 

Last week Karen told Caleb that she couldn't work Wednesday (today) of this week. So Caleb had to go into the computer and delete her off of the schedule for today. This had many many many bad effects. It changed me, Daniel Rodrigs, Daniel Halls and Sammys schedule times for this week. So as an effect I was ""late"" two days in a row (but not by my schedule at home. Their schedule at the store said I was). The same thing happened to the previously mentioned boys. 

The way this action effected todays schedule is as follows. Caleb told me last week that I would no longer be opening (4:45) but coming in at 6:30 and that Lyn would be opening instead of me. Since there had been so much confusion about my schedule this week. I go up to the store on Tuesday night to double check my schedule. Well, the daily schedule said that I was supposed to open (4:45) and the weekly one said that I was supposed to be in at 6:30. So I ask Tim what to do and he tells me to call Lyn to make sure she knows about the change. Well, her phone didn't work so then Tim advised me just to come in at open anyways and if Lyn showed up, just to go home. So I sucked it up and said ""fine."" 

So it's early early early Tuesday morning and the time is 3:15 when I go to sleep (I have to be awake at 4). So I wake up at 4 (45 minutes of sleep) and as I'm driving to work I stop by 7-11 and get an energy drink (this is where my health trouble started and keep in mind I had nothing in my stomach at the time). Then I go to work and I'm there for about 15 minutes opening with Steve and I say to him ""Ya know, I keep imagining Lyn's car coming around that corner and saving me from my lack of sleep."" I kid you not, like 3 seconds later her little silver bug whips around that corner and I scream ""OH GOD YES!"" (It sounded kind of sexual so I think I freaked Steve out...but I was just releaved.) So Lyn comes in and me, her and Steve look at the daily schedule and we have to COMPLETELY re-write it. 

So then I go home, sleep for another 45 minutes (making a total combined amount of sleep at an hour and a half.) I come back and work from 6:30-1:30. During my lunch though, all I had was another EFFIN HUGE energy drink. (Contents of my stomach at that point were two huge energy drinks) which happened to be the only thing keeping me awake...the ONLY thing! 

On top of all this, the high school had early release so we had all the little monsters in our store all day *bah!* OK, so I finally get to go home at 1:30 and it felt freaking great! I get home (not feeling too hot) take a shower and I still felt like poo. Then Daniel calls me and asks (honestly thinking I'd say yes) to closing tonight after the morning I'd had. The kicker is, it was covering for Robert...I hate hate hate him...so it was a hell no. 

Anywho, so I got dressed and told myself that if I went out and did something that I'd feel better. So I go to Wal-Mart, Old Navy and Payless and I got a new pair of sandles. Then I decided it was probably a good ideah to come on home cause I wasn't feeling any better and it was DEFINATLY affecting my driving skills. I thought though, that I'd stop off at my old Sonic before I came home.

OK, normally I pull up and see a whole bunch of people I don't know *bummer*...not today though...lol. I pull up and I see Negar, Renee and Brandon walking around *smiles!* Haha...then Brandon skates up with the courtesy tray...hehe (this made me smile) He's like ""My friend told me there was a hot girl over here in this car so naturally I had to come check it out."" I was like ""Damn straight."" The best part was he was wearing ...ROLLER SKATES! Lol.....oh it was funny. Then I got to talk to Renee who I haven't seen in the longest time. Ahh...I miss those people...but God how I DON'T miss that job. Starbucks is home now. 

Anywho, so I come home and get into my comfy clothes and lay in bed hoping to feel better and I feel asleep at about 8 and woke up at 1. Which means it'll probably be another night of 4 am bed times.

Lord, could ya maybe perhaps HELP ME OUT HERE!

Anywho, thanks for reading the ramblings of a crazy lady

Tomorrow is a new day

"event","Man, I haven't done an actual entry in a while. It's been usually quiz stuff or surveys (no one wants to read that shizznit). So here's a real one for ya. Today was sad cause it was my (realy cool) managers last day. *tear* The new manager seems real cool so far though. Let's just hope it continues. 

So after I got off work I came home and rested my feet *feels good* then I remembered that I hadn't bought a CD in a while :-) so I went to wal-mart and got two new CD's. The first one is ""Lemon Love"" (Aslyn) and the second one is ""Hot Fuss"" (The Killers). I was very happy with it. 

Tomorrow is a day off work for me :-D. But I have to work on my rough draft for an English paper all morning. So tomorrow is all about school...once again. I'm excited about school in the fall though. I'm just realy realy realy excited. Brookhaven offers a MUCH BETTER journalism program than North Lake does. Plus...North Lake has too many scary kids there. There's only a few normal ones like me (if you consider me normal)...lol. 

OOH! But I'm realy super duper excited cause my Dad has this kick ass company lap top right now, but he's getting another one in three weeks and giving me the older one. God is so good! I've been needing a lap top for a while and I get one! So I might be replacing my computer with my lap top. Probably not...but I just may if I feel brave enough to hook it up at my house where every piece of electronic equiptment gets a freakin virus!

I realy can't wait to get this maymester over with though (it's still to come) so I can just sit back, relax and enjoy my summer vacation. 

Oh, but Kristin stopped by Starbucks today (haven't seen her in a while), and she was telling me that she thinks Steve (my buddy) might be leaving Starbucks *tear*...I'm gonna have to have a chat with that boy about it. He said that he wants to be interning at his church (which is stellar), but if indeed he does leave...he will be missed. 

Anywho...I know I've got this website and an Xanga too...but I've actually taken up old fashioned journaling...It's realy cool though cause the paper in this journal was made the old fashioned way in Nepal...so it's got that textured feel and it's pretty rad. Well since I'd feel bad writing in this old fashioned journal with a new fashioned pen...I got a QUILL! I never realized how hard those things are to write with...but it looks so cool, now I understand why you couldn't read peoples writing back in the day. My handwriting looks like freaking Da Vinci's handwriting. It's cool though...I LIKE IT! 

Welp...there you have it folks...an actual entry ;-) .....enjoy!

"event","So ya know how some whiney boy made that article about ""Nice guys"" and (girls) all of you know that after you read it you said ""GOD...what a load of bull shit!"". I know that all of you have always wanted someone to write one for the nice girls out there. Well here it is...Someone finally did...an ode to us nice girls.

                               Ode to the Nice Girls
              This rant was written because a nice girl finally snapped. 


I've read the tribute to the nice guys; this is my response. 

This is my tribute to the nice girls. To the nice girls who are overlooked, who become friends and nothing more, who spend hours fixating upon their looks and their personalities and their actions because it must be they that are doing something wrong. This is for the girls who don't give it up on the first date, who don't want to play mind games, who provide a comforting hug and a supportive audience for a story they've heard a thousand times. This is for the girls who understand that they aren't perfect and that the guys they're interested in aren't either, for the girls who flirt and laugh and worry and obsess over the slightest glance, whisper, touch, because somehow they are able to keep alive that hope that maybe... maybe this time he'll have understood. This is an homage to the girls who laugh loud and often, who are comfortable in skirts and sweats and combat boots, who care more than they should for guys who don't deserve their attention. This is for those girls who have been in the trenches, who have watched other girls time and time again fake up and make up and fuck up the guys in their lives without saying a word. This is for the girls who have been there from the beginning and have heard the trite words of advice, from ""there are plenty of fish in the sea,"" to ""time heals all wounds."" This is to honor those girls who know that guys are just as scared as they are, who know that they deserve better, who are seeking to find it. 

This is for the girls who have never been in love, but know that it's an experience that they don't want to miss out on. For the girls who have sought a night with friends and been greeted by a night of catcalling, rude comments and explicit invitations that they'd rather not have experienced. This is for the girls who have spent their weekends sitting on the sidelines of a beer pong tournament or a case race, or playing Florence Nightingale for a vomiting guy friend or a comatose crush, who have received a drunk phone call just before dawn from someone who doesn't care enough to invite them over but is still willing to pass out in their bed. This is for the girls who have left sad song lyrics in their away messages, who have tried to make someone understand through a subliminally appealing profile, who have time and time again dropped their male friend hint after hint after hint only to watch him chase after the first blonde girl in a skirt. This is for the girls who have been told that they're too good or too smart or too pretty, who have been given compliments as a way of breaking off a relationship, who have ever been told they are only wanted as a friend. 

This one's for the girls who you can take home to mom, but won't because it's easier to sleep with a whore than foster a relationship; this is for the girls who have been led on by words and kisses and touches, all of which were either only true for the moment, or never real to begin with. This is for the girls who have allowed a guy into their head and heart and bed, only to discover that he's just not ready, he's just not over her, he's just not looking to be tied down; this is for the girls who believe the excuses because it's easier to believe that it's not that they don't want you, it's that they don't want anyone. This is for the girls who have had their hearts broken and their hopes dashed by someone too cavalier to have cared in the first place; this is for the nights spent dissecting every word and syllable and inflection in his speech, for the nights when you've returned home alone, for the nights when you've seen from across the room him leaning a little too close, or standing a little too near, or talking a little too softly for the girl he's with to be a random hookup. This is for the girls who have endured party after party in his presence, finally having realized that it wasn't that he didn't want a relationship: it was that he didn't want you. I honor you for the night his dog died or his grandmother died or his little brother crashed his car and you held him, thinking that if you only comforted him just right, or said the right words, or rubbed his back in the right way then perhaps he'd realize what it was that he already had. This is for the night you realized that it would never happen, and the sunrise you saw the next morning after failing to sleep. 

This is for the ""I really like you, so let's still be friends"" comment after you read more into a situation than he ever intended; this is for never realizing that when you choose friends, you seldom choose those which make you cry yourself to sleep. This is for the hugs you've received from your female friends, for the nights they've reassured you that you are beautiful and intelligent and amazing and loyal and truly worthy of a great guy; this is for the despair you all felt as you sat in the aftermath of your tears, knowing that that night the only companionship you'd have was with a pillow and your teddy bear. This is for the girls who have been used and abused, who have endured what he was giving because at least he was giving something; this is for the stupidity of the nights we've believed that something was better than nothing, though his something was nothing we'd have ever wanted. This is for the girls who have been satisified with too little and who have learned never to expect anything more: for the girls who don't think that they deserve more, because they've been conditioned for so long to accept the scraps thrown to them by guys. 

This is what I don't understand. Men sit and question and whine that girls are only attracted to the mean guys, the guys who berate them and belittle them and don't appreciate them and don't want them; who use them for sex and think of little else than where their next conquest will be made. Men complain that they never meet nice girls, girls who are genuinely interested and compelling, who are intelligent and sweet and smart and beautiful; men despair that no good women want to share in their lives, that girls play mindgames, that girls love to keep them hanging. Yet, men, I ask you: were you to meet one of these genuinely interested, thrillingly compelling, interesting and intelligent and sweet and beautiful and smart girls, were you to give her your number and wait for her to call... and if you were to receive a call from her the next day and she, in her truthful, loyal, intelligent and straightforward nice girl fashion, were to tell you that she finds you intriguing and attractive and interesting and worth her time and perhaps material from which she could fashion a boyfriend, would you or would you not immediately call your friends to tell them of the ""stalker chick"" you'd met the night prior, who called you and wore her heart on her sleeve and told the truth? And would you, or would you not, refuse to make plans with her, speak with her, see her again, and once again return to the bar or club or party scene and search once more for this ""nice girl"" who you just cannot seem to find? Because therein lies the truth, guys: we nice girls are everywhere. But you're not looking for a nice girl. You're not looking for someone genuinely interested in your intermural basketball game, or your anatomy midterm grade, or that argument you keep having with your father; you're looking for a quick fix, a night when you can pretend to have a connection with another human being which is just as disposable as the condom you were using during it. 

So don't say you're on the lookout for nice girls, guys, when you pass us up on every step you take. Sometimes we go undercover; sometimes we go in disguise: sometimes when that girl in the low cut shirt or the too tight miniskirt won't answer your catcalls, sometimes you're looking at a nice girl in whore's clothing - - we might say we like the attention, we might blush and giggle and turn back to our friends, but we're all thinking the same thing: ""This isn't me. Tomorrow morning, I'll be wearing a teeshirt and flannel shorts, I'll have slept alone and I'll be making my hungover best friend breakfast. See through the disguise. See me."" You never do. Why? Because you only see the exterior, you only see the slutty girl who welcomes those advances. You don't want the nice girl.. so don't say you're looking for a relationship: relationships take time and energy and intent, three things we're willing to extend - - but in return, we're looking for compassion and loyalty and trust, three things you never seem willing to express. Maybe nice guys finish last, but in the race they're running they're chasing after the whores and the sluts and the easy-targets... the nice girls are waiting at the finish line with water and towels and a congradulatory hug (and yes, if she's a nice girl and she likes you, the sweatiness probably won't matter), hoping against hope that maybe you'll realize that they're the ones that you want at the end of that silly race. 

So maybe it won't last forever. Maybe some of those guys in that race will turn in their running shoes and make their way to the concession stand where we're waiting; however, until that happens, we still have each other, that silly race to watch, and all the chocolate we can eat (because what's a concession stand at a race without some chocolate?)

It wasn't until this week that I've learned that guys can be real people too. I mean good genuine people. I mean of course the guys that I'm friends with are the most amazing guys in the whole world. I ask myself though is that because they're not dating me and aren't datable prospects? Like are they that wonderful to me because I'm not dating them. I wonder if they treat the girls they date that well. If so it'd be odd to think of them the same. (w0w...totally got off track there) I wittnessed a totally sweet (kinda scary) but sweet act this week. So this guy I know who I'm good friends with is dating this girl. (They're pretty new too...like they JUST started dating). So this girl tells him about this time when a guy REALY mis-treated her and he immediatly got furious...like REALY REALY REALY mad. So he was telling me that the one thing he just can't stand is guys treating girls bad. I swear it was like a breath of fresh air hearing that from a living breathing boy. I do believe that's all for my daily ramblings...on a similar topic. After I'm done reading ""The birth of Venus"", I'm going to start this book called ""Datable"" it's about what guys think of girls and vise versa. I do believe it should be enlightening. 

...*hmmph* man it's been a long time since I've dated a guy. lol...I need a cure to this problem.

oh well...I guess I'll just ""roll with it""  ...whatever that means:-/

So this friend of mine...we shall him *guy* so *guy* is a friend of mine from a previous job and we're still buds. He's always always always hitting on me though...I'm pretty sure it's all in a fun joke way but I got the stellar ideah today of telling my boss to freaking grill him the next time he sees him and be like ""What do you want with Michelle? What are you intentions toward her? and bla bla bla"" Dude...this is gonna be freakin hysterical! 

(switching topic). So I don't know about the rest of you chick flick loving girls out there but I know that I bought ""The Notebook"" the first day it came out and when you buy it, Kleenex has this neat little advertisement inside. It's a picture from one of the scenes in the movie and Noah is holding allie at the beach and they're gazing into eachothers eyes and smiling and then it says in an empty spot on the picture... ""Have you ever found someone you just knew you were meant for?"" I have to say...I pinned that thing up on my bulliten board 'cause everytime I look at that thing it makes me happy/anxious. *sigh* can't wait till I meet that person that ""I'll just know"" is meant for me. 

Welp...""it's 3 AM and I must be lonely""...(Matchbox 20)...as the song goes...I'm actually listening to John Mayer right now but I need some sleep...

Apparently some of my sewing needles fell on the ground and I hadn't realized that I'd missed one when picking them up because as I'm getting up from my chair to go to bed I stepped on one and it went pretty deep into my second toe. IT HURT LIKE HELL! So I go to bed thinking I'd be fine in the morning. Apparently not! It was purple and blue all day and on top of that...(ya know that feeling of tingling you get when your arm falls asleep?) that's the feeling I had on the surface of my skin from 4 PM till right now (2:17 AM) today and it was driving me crazy!!! Concerned...YES! Going to the Dr. tomorrow...YOU EFFIN BET!!! 

So there's my ""whoah that sucks"" story of the day. Welp...that guy *sexist pig guy* the only person I don't like working with at Starbucks...well I had to work with him tonight. :-/ It actually wasn't horrible cause me and Daniel made fun of him the whole time which made the night a little more enjoyable.

"event","So here's the deal. My Mom is ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS borrowing money from me. The thing is...she NEVER EVER EVER pays it back. So everyone keeps telling me. You're not her personal safety net, you need to tell her no and tell her why you're telling her no. Then she'll understand. So I told her No and I told her why. I said ""Mom, I'm not your personal safety net and I lent you $250 last time and you never paid it back. Then you took $90 a week out of that for my car payment (which was still technically my money). You still owe me $70."" Her responce to this wasn't ""Oh my God you're right and I'm so sorry...etc..."" it was ""Well sometimes I don't think you desearve to get your money back..."" EXUSE ME?!?!?! I work my ass off for that money and I sure as hell earned it. Then I LENT it to you and YOU STILL EFFIN OWE ME!!! I sure as hell do desearve that money and it's not up to your mood to decide if I get it back or not. That money either came out of my tips or paycheck and it's legally mine. I'm not lending you any more money untill you prove to me that you are going to be responcible from now on about paying me back IN FULL and ON TIME! So she freaking went off on me telling me to take my clothes to a laundry mat and to move out and to not eat a piece of food that she buys ever again. I just responded with ""Mom...you're not always going to have me around to bail you out when you're in a bind."" ""What would you do if I wasn't here??? Make Jordin get a job just so you could bum money off of HER?!"" No, cause she would have put her foot down a long time ago..and HEY...you'd be screwed."" ""This is why you don't use peoples money to spite them...cause it comes back around and bites you in the ass!!!"" So I finally did it. I said my piece and I finally stood up for myself. 

...So why do I feel so bad? I know it's just pitty because I feel sorry for her but I still feel like the biggest jerk ever. I mean I know I did the right thing but why does it hurt so much???

Jesus...help me out with this one!!!

"event","So it's finally hit. It's official, I have Spring fever. I know exactly what brought it about too. Watching the Real World Philli and watching Landon and Shavonda fall in love just makes me want to be in love. More than anything though...I just miss going on dates. It's been forever since I've gone on a date. Like a good four or five months. I mean I'll admit I don't like the ideah of a relationship. Not being able to flirt with everyone does not sound like fun to me. I just miss casual fun dating. I miss the feeling of getting calls two and three times a day just to say ""I miss you"" or just calling to say ""Hey, I'm at Wal-Mart""...ya know...just stupid cute stuff like that. I mean don't get me wrong...I get flirted with a lott and I do my fare share of flirting too but Spring fever has definatly hit this girl and heck I'd even go for a little spring fling. I just want someones hand to hold when I'm watching movies or someone to call when I'm just in a playfull mood or just someone to kiss in the rain. 
Trust me, I'm not asking for a blind date, and I'm hoping none of you call me with the line ""I know this great guy..."". I think I just wanted to vent. But looking at it from another perspective...maybe I am tired of just flirting...maybe I do want something a little more. Maybe secretly I do want to get over my fear of commitment and finally have a real relationship. I mean sure I'd totally go for a spring fling. But...ya know I'd be down for actually starting something real too. Looking at it from yet a third perspective...maybe I just need to forget about boys and take this time to figure out me and what I want right now and what I'm ready for. 

...I do think though that ultimatly I'm just looking for some love and affection. 

So sound the alarm and alert the troops...Spring fever is here and the bug has bit...and bit EFFIN HARD!"

there was comfort in your eyes
there were locks on all the doors to my heart
yet you seemed to find the keys
when did you see
see just where this path would lead
and somehow you knew 
you knew this could work
this test of me and you

true, you must have a gamblers spirit
to throw caution to the wind
somehow I knew this chance could work
just to scared to let it begin

and as this secret keeps on building
oh what a tangled web we weave
those who said they thought they knew us
oh how so easily decieved
let me say they'll never know
oh yes this secret how it grows

Well my friend I'm getting tired
secrets can sometimes get old
often times I just could care less
about this ""Secret"" life we hold
maybe it's just paranoya
maybe friends just won't care less
about this ""secret"" we keep hiding
ya know YOU do seem scared to death

so let it out let it out
my friend the truth will set you free
and if it's just too much to handle 
you can always lean on me
so let it out let it out
I think things could be serene
and if people start their talkin
well WHO CARES 'cause we're both free

but who cares it's just my own veiw
on how thing might turn out fine
on second thought i just might tell you
perhaps I'll just make up my mind
if we indeed do keep this secret
i ask the good it would do
for your life and for my own
how 'bout we both just turn it loose

So I'm reading this book Ana Korinina and it's written in such a way that you could realy imagine what it's like to be her. So I decided to write a song on it. Let me know what ya think."

"event","So I do believe this post will be all about love and my thoughts on the subject. So it's about 8 months till I turn 20 (which is real scary). Most people meet the person they're going to marry between the ages of 16 and 24 (at least that's what some stats in a magazine told me). Well this of course got me thinking. ""I wonder if I've already met the man I'm supposed to marry and don't even know it. Or, if I haven't met the man I'm supposed to marry...will I realize it when I do finally meet him?"" Ya know...every girl my age starts thinking about marriage. I'm just glad I'm one of those girls pondering it and not on a freaking husband hunt (which is absolutely idiotic). I mean most women when they  talk about their husbands always say ""he was nothing what I'd expected my future husband to be like"" Hmmph...I don't know. I bet...gah it would be so typical if something like this happens to me. I've got my life set and everything in it set and everything is going great and then...OUT OF NO WHERE...here comes Mr. Right and the second we exchange names will be the first day of the  rest of our lives. I'm so totally into love at first sight...that would be killer if that happened to me. Of course my future husband is going to have to deal with sooo many peculiarities of mine! First of all...EVERYTHING has to be in some sort of order. Whether it's height or alphabetically or color...I'm so freaking anal about that. Second, I'm a slob when it comes to laundry and the kitchen. Thirdly, I NEVER EVER DUST...unless made to by some force of God. I eat all the food in the fridge at once. Like if my Mom buys a whole big bag of tomatoes...I don't portion them out and eat a little each day. THAT WOULD BE MADDNESS! I sit down with my little bottle of mexican spice lucas and eat them like apples all in one sitting. (same thing goes for pickles, any kind of berry, pamagranite, cucumbers, OMG STAR FRUIT, and the pre-packaged guacamole). I can see your face as you're reading this right now...you're thinking to yourself...GOOD GOD SHE'S A PIG! And my friend, you are absolutely right. The absolute worst thing my future husband will have to deal with though...is my need to have music playing as a fall asleep. I mean these songs can get as cooky as the theme from ""the never-ending story"" (which I fell asleep to last night). Lol...yes I do believe I'll be quite a handful. 
Then I was thinking about what being married would actually be like. I think it would be so much fun! I mean I intend on marrying someone who I have a blast with and who is also my soul mate. So it'll be like a room mate for life. Wow, being a real adult. 

When I think of soul mates though...the first thing that comes to mind is the movie/book ""The Notebook"". That's a story of  two people who are truly soul mates and it aches them to spend one day apart. If you watch that movie...you can almost feel what it's like to be in love. Well, what I'd assume love feels like. I've never been in love before so I have no clue. (I wonder how many times I've said love in this post?) 

Welp I think before I change the subject I'm gonna tell you guys my favorite commercial. The one where the couple is in this city square in Europe and the guy says ""hang on a sec.....I LOOOOOOOVE THIS WOMAN!!!!!!"" And all the pigeons fly and it's just romantic.

So mid-terms are this week and then it's SPRING BREAK! Now some people are going to Mexico for spring break or Florida or New York or Hawaii or even Australia. ME? Me you ask? I will be right here at home in good 'ole Coppell working at Starbucks. Yes, that's right. I will be working all of Spring break. It's OK though, I'm sure I'll see TONS of you up there at work just like I did over Christmas break. I'm serious...starbucks is like the new Seven-Eleven...it's crazy. Welp, even if you don't come there alott...stop by and see me if you're in town for spring break. 

Oh, by the way...one of my friends girlfriends just dumped him. So he's letting me hook him up on some blind dates to help him get over it so if you're up for a blind date with an awesome guy...let me know and I'll set it up.

Hmmmph...welp I guess that's it. If you are going to Mexico on spring break. All I have to say is pleeease be careful because there have been a lott of kidnappings down there recently and I'd like for all of you to return home safely. Thanks

You are under considerable stress and you are almost about to 'blow your top' but you are fortunate enough to be able to exert control. Control is the name of the game and it is so good to realize that whatever the situation may be at this time - it will pass. You need to get away from everything for a while and if you do, you will find that, strangely enough, it will seem that most of your problems and situations will seem to wash away, just as the sea may wash away 'footprints' in the sand.

Being a likeable person you get on well with neighbors and friends. You don't need anything to 'Rock your boat'. You want to 'love' and to be loved'.

You honestly believe that your hopes and ideas are realistic, but there seems to be no one around to give you the necessary reassurance and encouragement. You are egocentric. You believe that you are always 'right' - well maybe you are but you have a short fuse and are likely to take offense for the slightest reason.

You are being unduly influenced by the situation that is all around you. You do not like the feeling of loneliness and whatever it is that seems to separate you from others. You know that life can be wonderful and you are anxious to experience life in all its aspects, to live it to the full. You therefore resent any restriction or limitations that are being imposed on you and you insist on going it alone.

You need to be needed and would like a situation where you will no longer be subjected to pressures and demands from those about you. There is no harm in 'dreaming' but it is you - and only you - that can be able to realize those dreams and to turn them into reality."

"event","So it's about 3 in the morning. I do believe there's a great song entitled 3AM which I am currently trying to doze off to. ...yea it's not working. I'm in one of those ""thankful for everything"" moods. Today (for some odd unknown reason) I was thinking back on my HORENDOUS road trip to Missouri with Liz. I was thinking about how I couldn't shower for four days because when I arrived the tub was filled with used bath water and the other shower had mold-esque looking brown stuff on it, I reflected on the smell of urine in every single one of her relatives houses and how many kids they had (minimum of four per family of two poverty stricken parents), mostly though I remembered how utterly uncomfortable I was that whole weekend and how for the first time in my life I was truly home-sick for anything familiar and comfortable. After I was done re-living the awefull nightmare of a road trip I fell to my knees and thanked God. I thanked him for my monster of a Mother who underneath her crazy and sometimes psychotic exterior loves me to death. I thanked him for my Dog who (when she's mad at me) leaves a ""little present"" in front of my door. I thanked him for all of my friends whom I love despite their little quirks and whom love me despite my larger than life oddities (real word?) It's just been one of those days when I say to God, ""Yea I didn't get to go away to college as early as I'd expected but at least I'm making a 4.0 going to community college this semester which looks killer on my GPA, and you're slowly laying my plan out for me and I can kind of see the hazy outline starting to shape and though I've had some rough times in these past months, you've shown me such love lately that it's crazy."" (Yes, long prayer quote I know). It's just in times like these when I feel so guilty for ever complaining about anything in my life because there are some people in this world who are far worse off than me and true I do have tiny uncomforts in my life such as un-stellar relationships with my family members but I mean it's better than having parents who have abandoned you like some kids in this world who are even younger than me. 

...I guess what I'm trying to say with this whole thing is that I'm so thankfull for EVERYTHING in my life...the good and the bad. I guess it just takes one little after thought to make you realize how great things realy are.

On a lighter note... :)
lol, I've started my horrible addiction to tanning again. Yes yes, I know skin cancer will eat my flesh alive and  bla bla bla. I know all this, but I don't think you can truly know how relaxing it is untill you've experienced it. Imagine...the humming sound of a dryer (which is fabulous when you're right in the middle of the sound) and a bluish light just lulling you into calmness and if you go right after work when you're freaking tired you could even catch a 20 minute power nap. IT'S FABULOUS! Plus you get tan...and everything just looks better on you when you're tanner. lol...which in a way is just an ego boost for me. That's something that if I think I had anymore of...could be tredding on that thin line between confident and cocky. /subject change/ Speaking of cockyness...it's funny how much I've realy changed since high school. It seems like right after my last church camp with FBC I got this huge surge of confidence. It felt awesome. I've never been able to truly explain the total personality change but I do think I can attribute this to one thing...The Ashlee Simpson show. HEAR ME OUT!!! I'd always wanted to dye my hair...I just never had the balls to do it. Then when Ashlee dyed her hair on the show I said to myself ""Ya know Michelle, it doesn't look like shit...maybe you should just go for it and if it looks like crap...oh well, it's just hair."" So I went up to Kroger and got the dye and did it and as if by magic after I'd blow dryed my hair I spoke words I'd never said before. I looked in the mirror and said ""Damn I'm hot!"" I do believe it all started from there and it's truly been the freaking snow ball effect. 

So since I suspect you probably zoned out half way through my post I'll just end it here on this note. 

Thank you to Ryan Gosling (Star of ""The Notebook"") Thank you to you and your beard in the movie which SINGLE-HANDEDLY started my fascination/liking of boys with beards. Currently I've just been thinking it's freaking hot. So thankyou Ryan and all the other boys out there who are not afraid of the beard. I do believe each boy once in his life should try having one. lol, that is all.

I'm watching ""Their eyes were on God"" and man oh man is it good. I haven't seen many movies that are just as good if not better than the book but this is one of them. Halle Berry is paired with this incredible unknown actor and they have one of the best on-screen chemistrys I've ever seen before. I hope it's on again 'cause I totally want to  record it. 

Ya know I realy don't have anything else left to write about...oh but thanks to all of you who gave me good feedback on the snippette of my essay I left on here. Welp, I guess that's it for now.

"event","So, I'm trying to write an essay about why we shold have prayer in public schools, I'd like some feedback so I'm gonna post it up on here and you guys let me know what you think.



Everyday during first period we stood and said these words ""one nation UNDER GOD with liberty and justice for all."" Isn't it funny how we acknowledge him for our great nation but if a student wanted to pray to God and thank him over the PA system we'd have parents and activist students in an uproar. The sole reason this country exsists today is because of religious persecution overseas in Great Brittian. Those people were being told that they couldn't speak of their God or of their religion so they decided to come to America and start anew. Now more than 500 years later and we're doing the same thing to our own. It's unGodly and totally and completely unconstatutional. 

One of our freedoms guarenteed by the constatution is freedom of expression. The freedom to express our political veiws is still there but heaven forbid when we try to express our veiws on religion. My senior year of high school, I tried to wear a shirt to school that said ""free prayer"" and the assistant principles and the teachers were in an uproar about it. They felt it invaded those people who didn't seem to share the same religious veiws as myself. I told them that they were invading me by limiting my choice of t-shirts and choice of expression which the constatution guarentees. Had I gone so far as to take this issue to court, I would have won hands down. Most students however will not take it that far, they will just make their statement and leave it at that when told not to do it anymore. The public school system is limiting our freedom of expression.

Our constatution also states that we should have the freedom of speech to say what we will. Yes there are a few conditions to that one, but saying ""jesus saves"" in a school news paper meets all of the conditions and offends no one. If you do not want to read it, don't pick up the school news paper, it's not like they cost money so they aren't costing the student who doesn't wish to read it anything. Just don't pick up the free news paper. (I'll add more to this later)

*sigh* OK I know so far it sucks, It's just  brainstorming and it's not due untill after spring break. I just put a little bit of it down on here so I can get some responces back and maybe a few ideahs/suggestions. Again.....this is an EXTREAMLY rough copy. It still needs a butt load-a work. 

...just let me know

"event","So.....here's the thing, I'm extreamly pissed of right now and I realy don't care who reads this and what they think. So correct me if I'm wrong, but if a freind gets you a job, you should make that friend look good because they put their name on the line for you. So therefor you should work hard and not be a flake. So I got this kid a job and he's doin a good job for like the first week. Then he starts to royally fuck it up. (scuse the french) He starts not showing up, no call, no showing, then on Wednesday he calls and he's like ""I'm sick and realy can't work"" which is totally understandable because he had a concussion on Monday. So we're sympathetic. Then me and Janette get EFFIN SLAMMED! We've got a line out to the effin parking lott and around the corner and it's just me and her, I'm on the register and she's making the drinks. It's OK though cause we know if he was there he wouldn't be able to work anyways and all went smooth that day so it's water under the bridge right. Then today he didn't call or show and we were slammed but we had another new girl who doesn't quite have her bearings yet and *gawwwhhhh* this whole thing is just a huge fucking mess. (sorry for swearing again) Therefor I vowed to never ever ever reccomend ANYONE for a job ever ever again. So to all of my friends who need jobs and whom I may have been able to help out. You have all been royally fucked over (sorry again for the bad language) because of one guy. I shall not give you a reccomendation because of this one guy. So to this guy I have one thing to say ""F*** you."" The reason I can say this and not feel bad is because I was in the middle of a nap today and my boss (who is in Seattle right now at a Starbucks managers conference)  calls me and chewed my ass out for reccomending this guy and that he's realy pissed at me for wasting his training money on some flake. *GRRRRRRR* I will never stick my neck out for anyone ever again. 'Cause this time, it got effin chopped off.

Anywho, I shall leave you all with one final message.

..........T-MOBILE SUCKS AND CAN KISS MY HINEY!!!

"event","Ya know what I miss? I miss new people, and new boys in specific. That feeling that you get when your getting to know some new guy for the first time and figuring out all his little quirks and how they mesh with yours. I haven't done that in a good four months. I mean...sure, sometimes you get hurt, and then sometimes you've gotta be the one doing the hurting, but HEY! That's part of life and I'd like to stop sheltering myself and experience a little bit of that. I mean there are a ton of guys I could be dating right now. So why aren't I? I know it's not fear on my part...I'm a pretty flirty person in general. Normally if I find someone attractive in any aspect...I'm gonna flirt with them. Most of the time not even realizing it though. Although maybe part of why I'm not is because I'm (on some sub-concious level) afraid of being used again. I mean that last guy seemed nice and look what happened. ""Oh I don't smoke or drink...I just can't help it, I'm one of those nice guys."" OH PLEASE! Ya we look back on that one now and roll our eyes...lol. Ya, Coppell is way too tiny and we have a shortage of descent datable guys. (Not like any town in the rest of the metroplex has an abundance of them)...but Coppell needs descent/datable guy donations...haha. Welp, I think if I said any more on that topic, it could be getting stupid real quick. 

On another topic, I'm having a writers block on this next essay I'm doing, I asked Daniel if he thought it was OK (Daniel is a journalism major and copy editor of Brookhavens news paper, so his opinion is valid), and he said it was realy good and I'm a real good writer, but my english teacher still wants me to tweek it. I hate that thought cause, I feel that it's quite good. So I'm gonna have to go into the writing lab on Monday and see what I can do. 

Anywho, I guess that's all I feel like typing out for right now. lol

"event","So I have definatly been slacking on these things. Welp, I will tell you about Missouri now. It was like a bad episode of Rosanne on acid. Enough said. The details might make you vomit...as they did to me while I experienced them. Next topic, school is going great. I missed learning, I like the way my brain feels when it's doing school work and learning stuff. My teachers are stellar and it's good stuff. Work is stupendous. (Way to use those SAT words you never used in High School...lol). The sexual harrassment guy at work got taken care of. I showed him whose boss. I'm thinking about post-poning moving out for college in the fall. There have just been some realities set down on me lately. I need to save money to do that. I think I shall get my associates first and then do the batchelors away from home. Who knows...I'd ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE to move out into an apartment and get a room mate or two. Guys or girls...I DON'T CARE AT THIS POINT! I just realy realy realy realy realy wanna move out of the rents house. It's litterally driving me nuts. Especially since Mom's going through menopause. I feel like I definatly should NOT be here right now. She's like Mt. St. Hellens, you never know when she'll blow or in which direction (to which person). So it's like living in constant fear. Or in this case, anxiety. I have diverged a plan though. If I hear her yelling at either Jordin or Brianna I get all the stuff I can (Purse, backpack, books I'm reading, CD's...etc...) and I turn my phone on silent (so I can't hear if she calls) and head out for at least 3 hours. Then I come back and listen at the back door. If I hear no yelling, I know it's safe to come in. Pretty good plan eh? Ya, I thought so too. 

Anywho, that's all that I can think of writing for now. I'll catcha later.

My boss just kinda looked at me and I was like ""what?"" and he was like ""do you not even realize how hard and rough your life is? ...is it just the norm for you so much that you don't even realize how wrong all of  this is?!"" and that's when it hit me. I never did realize...I mean it's the only thing I've known in my life so I just think that this is how it's supposed to be. NEGATIVE! 

That just put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. Yay for new hair cuts and reading though:-D

"event","So who else got pissed off that livejournal was shut down over the weekend. So recently I've been doing some thinking (some say too much thinking...but they can bite me.) ...and I've realized that as soon as your life gets amazingly perfect in one area...you realize it won't be like that forever so you've gotta live for the moment and take it all in. Like the people in your life...you don't know how much longer they'll be with you. This past week my grandfather was litterally inches away from death...almost gone. It's made me realize how fragile life and relationships are and to cherish them everyday. So no more worrying about the future for me. It's time to live in the present and soak it all in before it's gone. OK...I'll get down off of my soap box now. 

So this weekend me and Liz are taking a road trip to Missouri. w00 h00!!! I'm totally stoked about it. It's gonna be so much fun. Driving back by ourselves is the only thing that I've been biting my nails about. Anywho...classes start on Tuesday...I'm pumped...yay for changing my major. I'm a better writer anyways. Business just wasn't for me. 

PS. If some of the things I'm saying on here...your like ""where is this coming from?!"" Click on the ""my website"" link at the top under the pic of the shower head and check out the Xanga where the rest is written and shoudl explain a lott.

Anywho...Kyle wrote a song on the piano...he let me listen to it...:-D it makes me quite peaceful and happy. Let me know if you wanna hear it...it's saved. Anywho...oh I finally put my mexican blanket I got in Mexico up for my curtain. It looks cool. I'm quite pleased. I leave for Missouri in like 11 days. It's gonna be so much freakin fun! I'm stoked. I can't wait to get away from my parents. I think the only reason they're a little worried about me going is that they're scared of me spending my money. Welp...they're sadly mistaken. I'm giving myself a $10 budget for Missouri. Of course I'm taking more money than that just to be on the safe side. But I WILL NOT spend more than $10. That's a promise.

Ahhh...side note on Kyles song...I described it as a leaf floating down a stream in New England surrounded by trees with orange leaves and he named the song ""River Leaf"" :-D Oh so cool. 

On a totally random side note...I can't wait for ""The Notebook"" to come out on DVD. The book was still 10 times better but that movie was heart tugging. I read the book again last week. I had forgotten how romantic it was. I wanna find a love like that. Ahhh...that lucky girl. 

So yeah I'm gonna go sign up for classes tomorrow. I'm looking at English, Psych, and music appriciation. I hope it doesn't take too long 'cause I wanna go hang out with Liz before I have to go to work at 3:30ish. I'm supposed to go help her set up her computer on her new computer table and hook up all the wires and help her re-do it and whatnot.

On another completely random side-note...I miss my Grandparents. Especially now I think since my parents have grown such cold hearts towards me. I miss my Nana's warm and open heart that makes me feel so loved and safe. There's this one book that she always used to read to me when I was little called ""All around the mullberry bush"" and (my Nana has got the most calming reading voice ever) everytime she'd read me that book...all the bad things in my world just disappeared like dew at the sight of the sun. 

w00t...another random sidenote. Ever have one of those dreams when your breathing underwater or flying? Ya know how when you breath it feels like you're breathing in thicker air...like the air has something more in it like happiness, hope, peace, tranquility, love...etc...I totally and completely feel like that right now. It's REALY nice!!!

Everyone have fun as you all go back to your respective college towns...can't wait to do that for myself in the fall. Ahhh...SFA, here I come...(FOR REAL!!!) I've got the best room mate ever and we're gonna have a blast!

Anywho...I'm out

They said they promised that it would be. Then I asked them not tobuy anything else for me this christmas and they did anyways and now they're like ""we are only paying for you to register for classes and not for books or the other two installments because you don't clean the house and you talk back"" HELLO! All kids talk back and you make me miserable...I'm entitled to speaking a LITTLE of my mind once in a while. 

But hey, what can you do. It's not like I can be like ""I'm making you pay for it"" so I'll just suck it up and know for me that it's not fair and stupid and and life goes aon and I'll just deal with it knowing that I'm right.

"event","So today...hmmm not much went on. I had to open this morning which means that I had to get up at 4:30 to be at work at 5:15...yes folks...that's right...AM!!! It actually wasn't too bad today. Hehe...Kyle and Kevin came to visit me at 6 AM this morning. That made me smile...them being up that early AND out in the cold...to see me. Anywho I got off work at 2ish and then came home only to realize that my Mom needed for me to run errands...I would have rather chewed my hand off...lol. I did them anyways though. So I came home and took a VERY MUCH NEEDED nap. OOH! I have a funny story about that nap...so I'm taking a nap and I'm sound asleep and then I wake up to my phone ringing...it's Liz...after I see her name on the caller ID I look at the time on my phone and it said 7:25 (Sidenote: I didn't know how long I'd been asleep and I have to  work the next day at 7:30) So my phone went gay and disconnected and then I FREAKED OUT and threw on my clothes and jacket and gloves and grabbed my bag and then I ran out into the kitchen/living room area and looked out the window and it was pitch black and there was my whole family watching TV...and I thought to myself (""hmmm...they're all up un-normally early"") and then I was like ""Mom, what day is it?""................."".....Saterday"" she said *GROANED AND TRIED TO KICK MYSELF!* I totally thought that I was gonna be late for work but it was still the day before...damn me and my naps. The sad part is....this exact situation happens to me all the time...I wake up not knowing what day it is. (I swear I DO NOT drink or do drugs). I'm just crazy. ...or at least I've been told that so many times that I'm starting to believe it. 

Anywho...I've also been told that I think too much. Like..I was reading Katies Xanga and she had pictures of her great great grampa on there and her grandparents when they were kids and I was thinking...I wonder who I'll be with when I'm like 80 or 90. I mean...I know none of us can picture ourselves when we're that old...but I mean it's inevitable (unless *heaven forbid*...you die young). So I mean I wonder who I'll grow old with. I wonder if there realy IS a ""lid for every pot"" (as my Nana likes to say). It's also weird to think that most people get married in their mid to late 20's and I'm less than a year away from being 20 which means that in the next five years I'll meet that person that I'm gonna grow old with. SO WEIRD to think about. Haha...me and Rachel used to talk about soul mates and who we thought ours were...oh man those were interesting talks. I think that's the first time anyone actually thought my ""soulmate theory"" was kinda cool to think about. OH! I don't think I've told my soul mate theory on here before. OK...so here it is. When all souls are up on heaven and the angels are carrying the souls to God to be made into babies...God  takes the one ""super soul"" and divides it in half into a girl and boy soul and then shoots those souls into babies on earth. The babies could be as far away from one another as Paris and Hawaii but those two souls are like magnets...through out their lifetime they're drawn together and they keep coming closer and closer to one another untill one day they finally are re-united...BUT...what they do with that once they are re-united is up to  them. So anywho...that's my theory on soulmates. I like it...and that's all that matters. It's just odd to think that far into the future and know that it's coming and every day it gets closer and closer. Even as I'm typing this post it keeps getting closer. Whatever happens though...I just want to have a happy family and a happy marriage. I've seen how an unhappy marriage can make an unhappy family...that's the last thing I'd ever want to happen. Actually...I think I can call that ""worst night mare come true"" if it ever does happen. 

Haha...w0w...people are definatly right about me...I REALY DO think way too much! lol. Anywho...I guess that's it for today...oh...but I would just like to say that we (Class of '04) have just lost an incredible sould recently. Lindsey Ivy passed away. I was in Softball with Lindsey our freshman  year...that girl was special...and I'm not talking about...oh ya know she was a cool kid special...I mean that she was one of the most forward thinking people I've ever known. She was like a re-incarnated female version of John Lennon. She asked the tough questions...and answered the even tougher ones and then asked us to answer them for ourselves. She challenged us to start thinking...she was a great person. I didn't keep in touch with her after our freshman year...which is a shame cause she lives like 3 houses down from me. But I guess I just wanted to say something about her 'cause I think she desearves it. She will be missed, but she's in good company right now...I bet her and Lennon are having some amazing discussion right now up in heaven. She's in a better place. Keep her family in your prayers though.

Well I guess that's gonna be it for today.

"event","Welp I haven't done this in a while. To update...New Years was GREAT! Me and Liz went to a couple of parties...got lost on the way to the first one and almost ended up in Oklahoma...thank God when I called Kyle for his help his directions were awesome. So we made it to that party...it wasn't as much fun as we were hoping so then we went to this other party with this guy that Liz kinda likes. That one was a bit more fun...we stayed till about 12:45 there and then we left to go home. All and all...good night! Except for one thing...since we kinda got lost a little bit I didn't get to go to Katies party cause it was too late. That kinda sucked. But the job at Starbucks is going great. OH! Last Tuesday I was at Parma and Leslie was telling me about this thing that Chris wanted to do with all of us learning songs and then taking them to this recording studio on Thurs. and recording them for his youth choir. TOTALLY stoked about that...I hadn't  sung with those people in the longest time. Ahhh...it was nice re-living the good 'ole times. It was a lott of fun. I should get the CD in about 3ish months hopefully. Anywho...I guess that's it. Oh, but I've stopped meeting those guys with quirky habbits. In fact, I haven't met a new guy in a while :(. There was this one guy that one of my friends was trying to hook me up with...but it turned out he just wanted a piece of ass. I need to meet someone new. It's just been the same old people for the longest time. I mean it's not a bad thing. I've got the GREATEST friends in the whole wide world. But I dono...I kinda wanna make some new ones to add to the collection. Meh...I dono...this semester should be fun though. At least I won't be at home as much THANK GOD! 

Anywho, I guess that's about it. OH, and my New Years resolution is to experience something life changing this year.

"event","So tonight instead of going to The Lizzard Lounge with Rosanna and Stephanie (who I'm no longer friends with) I decided to go to Big Buck with some other Bass Pro people. It was me, Liz, Brandon, James, Paul, Deeder, Loui, Kevin, Julie and some other people whose names I don't remember...haha. Anywho...so me and Liz were talking and most of the people who were gonna end up going to the Lizzard Lounge with Rosanna and Steph either went home or were at Big Bucks with us. Serves them right for being so mean to Liz. I work tomorrow like 11-3 so that's a pretty short shift if I do say so myself...haha. Anywho...it'll be fun. Since I can run a register now and mark the drinks and make the teas and the black coffees and the fraps and the shaken teas and shaken coffees and...well I can pretty much do everything except for the bar...I haven't been trained on the bar yet but I should pick it up pretty quickly...(no...not like a regular bar...this is starbucks fool!). 

Anywho...oh I'm so excited...Kyles planning a camping trip for this spring...dude...that's gonna be so freakin stellar! I love camping. Anywho my fingers are getting tired of typing so I'm gonna go and get ready for bed since I have to be up at 10 tomorrow I can't stay up till 3 like I normally do...lol

So tonight instead of going to the Lizzard Lounge and getting felt up by weird guys (GROSE!) I'm goin to hang out with real friends at Big Buck. I think I have found two new FANTASTIC friends in Elizibeth and Brandon. Those two kids get the stellar award! Brandon might have a deuschy best friend but that kid is just so freakin nice. He's like on the Kyle level of nice-ness. lol. Anywho...I saw a whole bunch of old friends today. Good times...hopefully I get to hang out with all the friends I haven't seen in like 4 months 'cause they've been away at college.

Anywho...I guess that's it.

"event","AHHH! I hate drama so freakin much. I wish some people would just let go of things. Like if you say ""hey, you're not making very good decisions in life and I don't wanna be around someone with this kind of lifestyle so let's not be friends anymore."" The normal thing to do would be to accept it and get over it. BLAH! Anywho...my new job at Starbucks is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! I love love love it! It's so much freakin fun and easy and *sigh* i just love it. Another thing...how come every guy I've been meeting lately has both 1. Been totally into me and everything seems great AND 2. There's always something wrong with them. Either they're a hornball, clingy, jerk, bad conversationalist or some other weird thing. I don't even mind guys that drink and smoke at all anymore...it's the other weird personality traits they've aquired. All I look for is four things. Cute, Funny, Nice, and a Good conversationalist. Boys...is that so hard to be? *sigh* I guess so. Anywho...

I start classes in January. Thank God, I got so sick of not learning...my brain just felt limp. I know I wanted to be going to SFA this semester but I wanna make this as easy on my parents as possible so I'm just gonna start in the fall with...THE BEST ROOM MATE EVER! Ahhh...I'm so happy I found a cool chick  to room with. Me and Elizibeth are gonna have so much freakin fun! I'm so stoked about it. OOH! Rushing for sororities is gonna be more fun now that I've got a good friend comin' too. Things are gonna be so freakin great! 

OK...onto another subject now. Home-life...IT'S SUCKING. I am so miserable here. I'm sorry but I thought your family was supposed to love you unconditionally. I've never felt so hated by a group of people before in my life! I mean today I accidentally tripped over the doggy gate on the way to answer my cell phone (everyone always tripps over it) and my Mom actually called me a bitch because of it. I JUST WANT OUT! I can't do it anymore...I feel on the edge of an emotional breakdown right now. OK...maybe that's an exxageration but things definatly are not good around my house. My Moms gone psycho and my sisters are simply turning into freakin monsters. On top of all that...I miss my Dad sooo much! I mean I know it's best for everyone if he works out of San Antonio but I feel like I'm missing the only other person who was ever on my team. I love my Dad so much and I only get to see him a couple times a month. :'(.....it just sucks.

Onto happier subjects though...everyones comin home from school this week. WOO HOO! I missed all of them so freakin much! It's gonna be a blast! 

Anywho I think that's all I have to say at this point...

Anywho...so I start my new job at Starbucks tomorrow. I'm excited for it! I love the first couple weeks at a new job. I just need to get my sleep schedule re-adjusted...I decided that talking with Kyle till 5:30 AM  this morning was more important than sleep. Well it's not like I didn't get home late or anything. I went over to Elizibeths around 10:30 last night and left at like 2:30 and as soon as I got home I hopped online and didn't get off till like 5:30. I must be crazy. Yup...I do believe that's it. haha. Oh so I've made my christmas wish list...only three things.

1. College (for this semester) paid for.
2. New laptop (IBM thinkpad).
3. New CD player for car.

Welp...that's my list. Short aint it. I should write Oprah and tell her what I want...haha. That lady is my hero...she's so giving and has done so much. I hope when I grow up (who knows when that'll be) that I can be like her.

Anyways...blah...I'm listening to Copeland right now. I love love love them. 

Oh and I'm having trouble loading my picture onto my livejournal page. It just won't work...can anyone help me please :-(

Ya know...I think I was over him and I still am over him I'm just missing them right now cause honestly I've never laughed so hard as I did with him. It was nice having someone that I'd known for so long that I could just completely be myself around. When he went away, I think a part of me knew it wasn't gonna work just because of the distance. It just sucked when I was proven right. *hmph* I think right now I'm just missing the good times. Gosh...I need to get him out of my head. This is not healthy...lol. 
OK...I'm done talking about him now so it's onto a different subject...

OH! So to anyone (18 or older) who wants to come. Landon from the Real World Philli is coming to the Gypsy tea room on December 17th and there's a bunch of other REALY cool stuff going on that night too. So if you're home from college on December 17th and lookin for something to do...stop by the Gypsy tea room. Guarenteed to be a good time had by all. Gimme a call if ya wanna come *you should know the number*

So...I guess that's it for tonight...later gators

"event","So today I woke up knowing that I was going to Chillis at about 2 to see if I could get a job there and after that I was planning on going to Palm Beach to talk to them about a job. Then something happened...Starbucks called me at like 11ish and the guy (Michael) was like ""hey...I want for you to come in for an interveiw at 2."" So I went up there for my interveiw and he hired me on the spot...how cool is that?! So then I came home and took a nap and then I went on up to Palm Beach to go tan and when I got out of there...it was FREAKING POURING DOWN RAIN! So I go next door to Starbucks to wait it out and who should I run into but my good fellow EX-Bass Pro employees and good friends Alex and Travis. So we chatted it up for a while till the rain calmed down and I think I'm gonna go to the Lizzard Lounge on the 17th with them and some other Bass Pro people. God I miss the people at that job...do I miss the job you ask...HELL NO! It's cool that I can still hang out with everyone there though. Anywho...I discovered a GREAT new song that's actually on a CD that I own. It's on the CD ""Spirit Room"" By: Michelle Branch...and the songs name is ""here with me""...great great song. Not the lyrics or anything...just the harmonies and the guitar part is great too...it's one of those ""audio high"" songs. OMG...if I ever have a CD I'm gonna call it ""audio high""...AWESOME! I just copy righted it...so you steal and i sue ;).

"event","w0w! OK so today wasn't the best one. So I go into work today at noon and I'm working for a couple hours and I get this call on the radio and it's Mark (the head of human resources) and he wants for me and Mary (the lead in my department) to come to his office. So we get in there and it turns out that there have been ""complaints"" about me. One is that...(ok here's what happened). Last week we were staying later than usual to finish cleaning up the floor and when it came time for them to kick us out...my friend Sabrina made an anouncement since all the customers were gone. She was trying to say ""Attention all Bass Pro associates...you can go home."" But she totally screwed it up and it was kinda funny and we were all laughing. So I get on the radio and I'm kidding around with her (like we all do) and I'm like ""hey nice brain fart"". So it turns out *as Mark is telling me* that a customer and some associates found it offensive. OK first of all...ALL the customers were gone. Second of all...no associates found it offensive...because they've all said stupider things over the radio. Then Mark procides to tell me that I cussed out a fellow associate which is total BS because I've never ever ever done that nor would I even consider doing that. But...since they couldn't prove that I said that, the reason they were putting down for termination is the use of the word ""brain fart"". Is that not the gayest thing you've ever heard in your entire life?! I actually laughed...I walked out of that office smiling from ear to ear though because not only was that the funniest thing I'd heard in a long time but I'm finally done with this job that made me MISERABLE! Like seriously...more miserable than Sonic...(if that's even possible.)

So I was driving home and I was like ""I need some comfort drink"". So I head on up to starbucks to get me a caramel apple cider *YUMMM!* So while I'm there I have a strike of genius and I pick up a Starbucks application and they said I have a good chance of being hired. Then I went over to Barnes & Noble and picked one up but they're not hiring till January. Then it was over to Life Way Christian Store but they're not hiring till February. Then I headed over to the place that I tan at and got one and they said that they're not hiring but they are moving some people around and to come up on Monday and talk to the manager. Then I called Danley to see if Chillis was hiring...left a message...bla bla bla. 

So I get home and I'm watching Christmas movies and Danley gives me a call back and he's like ""yeah we're hiring and you'll probably get hired on the spot and yada yada."" So I'm like SCOOOOORE! I love working with food in food service anyways...it's more fun and I'm realy good at it. So anywho...tomorrow I can go to church and out to lunch with my Dad and just relax for the first Sunday in a while. Anywho...wish me luck in finding a new job.

"event","So today I looked in the mirror and realized it had been a month since I dyed my hair last and you could definatly see my very blonde roots coming out so I went and picked Brianna up from school and headed on over to Walgreens to pick up some hair dye. Once I got there though I soon realized that they didn't have the kind that I get so I zipped on over to Kroger and got it and then on the way back on the intersection of Moore and Sandy lake (where I usually turn left to get back to my house)...there were orange cones blocking where you're supposed to turn left and I didn't see in time and freaking ran right over them with a brigade of Cops and Fireman watching and laughing at me. So then I had to turn around...go back over them and haul ass to get out of sight at the chance they might give me a ticket. I don't think they would have though 'cause they were all too busy laughing at me and I could see the look of pity on their faces cause I was totally freaking out.

Anywho...that's been my day so far...hopefully tonight will be slightly more amusing for me.

I've discovered a new band. Copeland. Kelsey introduced me to their CD ""Beneath the Medicine Tree"" The whole CD is songs that the lead singer wrote about his girlfriend who died from cancer or something like that. My two favorite lines in the CD are ""She said that I was the brightest little firefly in her jar"" and ""I need you like the dragonfly's wings need the wind. Like an orphan needs home once again. Like heaven needs more to come in. I need you here like you've always been."" Those two lines are just so beautifully written.

Anywho today I went to lunch with the gals (well two of them...Rosie and Steph). We went to Olive Garden. I love that place. We had a good time. Now I fear I must go to work and I shall return at 11.

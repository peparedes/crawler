"event","I have such a headache. You would not believe it. 
on New years eve as well. It does not even seem like it's going to be 2007.
Shame. Although this year was fun. So many memories.
Reynold's grad speech *grin* one of my fav teachers at north,
along with destics, gustafson, huber, and stangl. How I miss them all.
Oh, silly me. I forgot Liden. And my first trip to sex world with Sarah A. 
And how we just laughed at everything while Kayla stayed outside. She was too young. Lol.

I am in the middle of reading ""Fairest"" by Gail Carson Levine. 
College is coming up. Along with my paycheck to go shopping.
I want to play ffx.
Eddie is medicated for his face, and i miss him so.
Head is pounding!! Ahhh. I hate it.

Loving My Chemical romance theses days. Andy's music is shit. Loud nonsense called ""screamo"" to me I do not even know how that ""band"" got a record deal. Idiots. All of them. Lol. 

What else happened this year? My first trip to a strip joint. Deja Vu. Lame. Lame as all hell combined. I loathed it. I could turn myself on more. Lol.

It's true. Hmm...grad party, graduation, ged, birthdays, holidays, no boyfriend....lol.
Wow, awesome year. I swear. 

I might drink tonight. Not sure. I have to go to work at 10 am. Does not sound like a good idea to go hung over. 

Hmm. 

Alyssa fares thee well. Muah."

"event","Well, I believe I do not want something that i thought I did.
I am in a room, where my eyes are watering. I do not 
like it at all. 

I do not have much to say in this blog. 

I hate how I feel. i want mdew. Solves all.
And I want to be with people my age.
And to be in a writing motivated mood. Ugh

"event","This means I do not have a soul. That when this hypothetical god like thing made me? (supposedly says christians not me) I was made without one. Lately all I think about is nothing. My mind is on a literal blank all the time. I have no reasonable excuse for this. It's like, I cannot feel. Not a damn thing. So many people have used me, trampled upon me, I liked myself a lot more when i never let people into my life.

And then what? I suddenly realize no one seems to care. And then i shut myself down. And run on auto pilot. Just thriving for the past few weeks. I hate it. I hate feeling so let down and empty. I feel as if no one can ever fill the void inside my heart. Maybe I am just a little useless now? I loathe sounding ""emo"" but I rather spill out how I feel then let it bottle up.

Because if I did that, then maybe i would explode. And that would be horrid. 
*sigh* oh gosh. Now what the hell do i do? Doesn't anyone just want to stab a care bear with a spork? I do. Tragic.

Thank someone for music. How would my day go on? lol. 

I just wanna drink some schnapps and pass out. For once in my life not be the goodie that I am.
I wanna be reckless.

"event","Oh, well i guess on top of my hellish week. I am apparently a stalker? jeez. Thanks. 
Well, seemingly as I know myself more then anyone else. (Wonder why????*glare***) Fuckers. Just say what you think. I think you're all drunken losers. But I will say it politely later on. 
I know I come off as a little persistent. I know. I am SOOO sorry. Pure sarcasm. 
Well, glad to know people like me. Heh. Fuck you.

Well, I did not mean to be. And truly sorry you did not express how you felt before I arrived. And apologize for my blatant attempts to be a ""stalker"". 

As if. Get over yourself. i have better things to do then stalk people. I rather kill them."

"event","I do not even know how to express myself today. I love that song ""Fully Alive"" by Flyleaf. Great band. I felt betrayed and empty and forlorn today.

All my friends seemed to have abandoned me. No one wants me. The rejected human. What can I do? What have I done? I need mountain dew. Badly. Can you turn my black roses red? hmm...I was thinking about myself earlier. In a non selfish way. That I am an empath reader. When I read books I then feel whatever mood the character is in. I felt so alone and filthy when i read this girl named Murphy was used and abused by her former lover. I then...felt that way.

Like all of her hatred was put inside me and I had to unleash it. 

Weird. I suppose that's what the author wants you to do. But even though the point came across strongly and well formated. I was like this all day at work. And it drained me. 

Sadly. I feel as if no one can ever possibly understand me. We're all alone at times."

"event","Hey. Well....this is sort of bland. Compared to my myspace at least.
I guess it's okay.

Not sure what to say. it's about 4 am. And I am mad at this Brett idiot. For giving me grief for not listening to him or whatever. Apparently he called me. Though no inkling whatsoever to confirm this. And I belive he did not and is lying to me.

*achoo* I feel sick. And I lost twenty dollars. And my manager flipped out on me today. Though, not sure why. But I hate work these days. I never want to go anymore. 

Some peope have had a lot to deal with. I feel so disconnected from my family and friends. Like I am on a whole other plane. And I want this to end now.

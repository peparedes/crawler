"event","Josh isn't on AIM... either that or my AIM just won't work. That sucks cuz I wanted to talk to him. oh well. He didn't come up like he said he was going to be all week because his class is slow. Literally.

And then there was soemthing about skipping everyday all week so he doens't have to go to English at all since He's doing the same thing in both classes and I kind of wanted to know if he was going to so I could tell my dad I'd be taking off again. BUt NOOO he's unreachable until I get home... prolly won't even be able to get ahold of him then. *sigh* I'm going to be so bored all day. LOL. (to Josh) yes, My life pretty much revolves around you sweetie.

I might not be home, so I hope he calls before he comes to my house because I'm going downtown to buy Mother day presents. His mom and Shari. 

Um... My VHS class is almost over so I'm going to get that application done and back to veronica as soon as I get it. And once I know if I'm getting the job I'll put in my two week with McD's. I should keep that job on the weekends but I know I'll never be able to do both. I'm a lazy bitch. 

Gonna try AIM one last time."

I just got an email from my cousin Courtney and my sister seems to think that in my last email I was hinting that I wanted to come back for good. I dunno where she got that idea. I do want to go for a visit, but that will be all. just a visit, nothing more, nothing less. Silly. But yeah.

I was going to go to Joshs track meet today, but it looks like he's not going, so I guess I'm not. But thats okay, cuz I'll still be with him. And thats all that matters.

I'd like to go see peg and Jay and Meg and Alex as well as  everyone else who I used to live with, but I dunno whats going on with that. So I guess I'll jsut wait and see. And email them. And hint...

"event","I'm going to cry! My phones not working, and I can't call Josh and ask him if he wants to do something tonight! *AH!!!!!* I miss him so much... and its not even been 72 hours. Oh me, Oh my. I am smitten. LOL. Somebody said that today. (smitten) Its.... quite the word. Not something I would usually use.

I am so bored I want to bite something... someone.... HA ha ha!

Okay, I haven't had any coffee this morning, so I am a little weird. More then a little. I AM A LUNATIC! Beware my craziness!

Anyway, Veronica wanted me to call her this morning at nine so we could pick up my dress, but when I called her cell phone it went straight to the voice mail message, which means it was off, or her battery ran out. I called the house phone, and low and behold, no one picked up. (mutter, mutter, mutter[bad words]) So I am angry at her. Very, very unhappily annoyed. (does that make sense?) I had to use my dads phone, and after blowing up at him the other day, I dont think he was real happy about it. So... yeah. 

Anyway, I'm also annoyed with Veronica because she said my phone would be fine today and IT WAS NOT! It still is 'temporarily disconnected'. GR!!!

Yes, today is one of those days where I am just going to rant and rave and spit and hiss and growl and scream!

Oh, And Josh? Happy belated 4 months. (twas yesterday... or would that be the day before? I am long gone)


""ready for another try
ready to be free
ready for these dreams of mine
to come and be real

Never going anywhere 
never doing anything
not allowed to be here
freedom is a tricky thing

Better to forget those dreams of mine""

"event","Well, hello again.

Its only eleven, I've got almost all of my VHS work done, and I'm not leaving until 12. Talk about bordom. *sigh* Josh said he was going to skip school so he could hang out with me, I told him not to, but I have no idea if he's actually going to. I hope so, despite the fact that I nagged him to stay in school. Yes, I'm that selfish. I want to see him, and though I really want him to stay in school so he can PASS, I wanna see him more. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Oh well. its the truth.

No lying here.

""Resist urges of the delicate nature, otherwise you may find yourself in an uncompromisable position.""

Why the random quote? your asking me? ha! Funny.

I'm trying for lightness today. I wore a new shirt I got at the mall, bright blue/green with lots of cleavage. Josh said if it was greener it reminded him of tinkerbell. I think I agree with him. Except the shirt is kind of sheer, when its not right against skin you can see through it a little.

I went to see my mom the other day, at the cemetery. (for those of you who dont know, she's (obviously) dead. Anyway, I bought a pot of Mums (If I remember right she liked those) and put them in front of the grave. I had to anchor the pot in the snow, which means the flowers are probably dead by now. That kind of makes me sad, but its the thought that counts, right? So what if they didn't last very long? At least I tried.

Right?

Sad music makes me think sad thoughts. (Amy Lee and Seether ""Broken"") Bad, bad sad music! But I really like the song.

Anyway, I think I'm going to see how much Josh is working tomorrow (sat) and ask Heather if she's free tomorrow morning. We can hang out before I have to go to work.

I'm grasping at straws. I really dont know what to say, so I just keep rambling on and on....

Should I discontinue? Maybe. Will I? prolly not. I guess it really doesn't matter, does it?


I'm totally out of things to complain/inform/talk about.

Well, we might play this new game I invented. Should be interesting. *grin*

Josh didn't come up at the normal time, and I think its because he had a class. Oh well. I'll see him later. or else.

Last night I stayed up on the phone for a while with him. Quite a while. I thought his voice might calm me, and it did, to some extent. Even after that (you know what I'm talking about, Joshy,) I still didn't fall asleep for an hour and a half. Did you sleep? probably. Well, fuck you. Never mind.

So yeah, I've got to call Steve today and tell him. and I've got to call the Social security office and see if I can finagle them into giving me a bunch of money. (won't that be cool?) and I've got an H&R Block meeting at 12:30 today. And then I've got to see if I can get someone to take me up to Steve's so I can pick up all my stuff. (I've got almost 200 dollars worth of horse gear up there and you can bet I'm not giving it away to them!)

Busy day. LOL. Especially considering how lazy I've been recently. God I have so much stuff I should do.... So much I say I want to do and never do. Arg. Which means I've got to go and do some of that stuff.

I've done all my work so far and am waiting for the third week stuff to come up so I can do it. it's kind of boring so far. Not terribly so, but enough that I'm getting lazy. Hopefully there will be something interesting soon...

The weekend started off bad, got worse, then got ten times better then most other weekends. (you know why) ah, still kind of.... silly, I guess. Well, I was in a bad mood on Sunday (stupid McDonalds manager) and then everything just kind of got lots better as soon as I saw Josh. Actually, right after I woke up and talked to him.

I watched Full Metal on Sat. it's such a good show... and most of the reason why I didn't get any sleep on saturday night. I got an hour. LOL. But thats okay, cuz last night I slept a full six and a half hours. I feel refreshed. LOL.

Why does the prom have to be so far away? It's sometime in May! GR>

So, yeah, anyway...

Talked to my friend Alica, again, and GOD is she having problems. I just wish I could do something to help. But thinking on it, theres really nothing I can do except to be there for her the best I can (considering that we don't live in the same state.)

I'm trying to make my own station at Yahoo while writing... and it's not working. GR. It's damn slow. Got music I liked, including Evanescence, LP, Sum 41, Blink182, and yes, I chose Green Day too. Now if only the stupid thing would work... I'll have to not play it loud cuz I'm in the school lib and I can't say the librarians would be very impressed.

Yes Josh, the details were absolutely fun. and exciting....

And where are you, by the way? I'm still wearing your sweatshirt. LOL. It's really comfy. I might not give it back. *grin* j/k. Dammit, you prolly just slept in but I'm worried about you anyway, because you could have had a really bad migraine and stayed home... or got into a car accident... or tripped and fell and broke your leg and had to go to the hospital...

Time to change the subject.

So, what we did yesterday. Melissa took us with her to Concord to fix her prom dress. (hence the subject). I was a loon, yes, thats right, I was more then a little crazy acting. After we dropped it off we went to the mall and just kind of browsed and walked around. Then we went into a lingerie store... *raises eyebrows suggestively* some of them looked like a lot of fun... Yes I'm a tease. (Josh knows that.) Don't you, sexy?

Veronica (Josh's mother) is taking me somewhere on Saturday to do something. Which we think is prom dress shopping. Mentioned this before I believe. But anyway, I'm really not sure what I should do, because prom dresses are expensive and a big part of my pride is saying that I can't let her buy it for me. Not without giving her something back at least. It's frustrating because I know she's going to insist on doing it and I have no clue how to handle this. GRRRR>

Wow, I just suddenly (and randomly) remembered a poem from when I was in like sixth grade. A very gross and naughty poem. I think I told it to Josh before.

Roses are red
pickles are green
I like your legs
And whats Between
I like your style
I like your class
But most of all
I like your ass

Roses are red
Violets are corny   (So not true)
When I think of you
oh baby, I get horny
Eat me, beat me
bite me, blow me
suck me, fuck me
very slowly
If you kiss me
Don't be sassy
use your tongue
And make it nasty

Kissing is a sport
Fucking is a game
Guys get all the pleasure
Girls get all the pain 
The guys says I love you.
You believe its true
Nine months later
He says 'The hell with you!'
The baby is a bastard
The mother is a whore
And none of this would have happened
If the rubber hadn't torn.

Sick, isn't it? LOL.

that all for today. bub bye.

Jess said I was scary today... in the I-get-too-hyper-and-silly kind of scary. LOL. I thought it was funny. I still think so. Maybe I'm just in a good mood, because otherwise I'd be slightly irritated by it. Could possibly be because I'm going to the movies tonight to see Elektra... Most likely its because I'm going with Josh, despite the fact I see him just about every day. How do you do this to me, hm Josh? Its your fault! All your fault! 
(BTW: it's not a bad thing. lol)

I finished the book I've been reading for the last few days. I love vampire books. Its the Anita Blake Series by Laurel K. Hamilton. (Thats right, I have the authors name memorized, just like with most of the books I read.) I've found very few vampire series that I really like as much as I like this one. Theres two others: Wings in the Night or the 'Twilight' series by Maggie Shayne, and a new series that has only two books out entitled ""Undead and Unemployed"" and ""Undead and Unwed"" by Mary Janice Davidson. I'm not sure what the name of the series is. But that one is absolutely hilarious. I can't wait until her third book comes out, ""Undead and Unappreciated"" 

Whelp, now that I'm done with that ramble about absolutely nothing anybody wants to hear... *grin*

What to write, what to write... Lish definitely isn't coming this weekend. (will we ever get together?) My dad really pissed me off this morn but I'm totally over it now. All I have to do was talk to Josh and all the world seems right again. (except for those poor tsunami victims, which I am donating again to As soon as I cash my check... actually, when we get back to school on Tuesday. I really don't have the money... but they don't have ANYTHING. its makes me feel inadequate when I dwell over my little insignificant woes.)

LOL. *wink, wink* I'm going to miss him for that short amount of time that I can't be with him. How did it come to be that I seem to want to spend every single waking moment with him? (and the wake-less ones) Wow.

"event","Not much to say today. Lets see... I love Josh. um... I'm kinda bored right now and I think I'm going to go and read a book I've been slowly reading in bits and pieces in the library. OH! I started writing these really sad lyrics. REALLY sad. I don't like them. I'm not quite sure why I was even writing them.



I wish you could see
The pain in my worshiping eyes
But how can you understand
Something I won't talk about?

(chorus)
Under the lies there's something more
In your eyes I try to implore
The depths of something thats not there
I realize it's useless ... and I'm scared



Um, thats all I have at the moment. It sounds a lot better when I sing it to myself. Nope, I'm not singing it for anybody, so don't ask. (Melissa and Josh. *glare*)

Bored now. Later.

"event","I'll admit, I'm slightly Tomboy-ish. Not a lot, but growing up with horses and working your ass off twenty-four seven can do that.... besides, all my best friends were tomboys too. lol. So when I wear a skirt, I feel very... not me. Usually. Until today. I wore it for my Josh, and for some reason I don't feel... peculiar like I usually do. Nope, today I actually feel sexy in it. weird, much? Maybe I'm going through some kind of personality change. Perhaps I'll be a more gentle, *laughter* loving, *sputter* easy-going girl. (I already was pretty easy-going I think. um... yeah) But gentle? *grin* SOOOO not going to happen.

I'm babbling. I wonder why? hm. I don't know. 

(crazy is as crazy does. What the hell does that saying MEAN?)

""Grapes are fun!"" ~Zander, Drawn Together.

What is the definition of lunacy? Is there a soul that really knows? I mean, people call me crazy, but I (almost always... though sometimes I lose myself when I'm with you, Josh) know where and when I am. So what is the true definition? Who the hell can really tell you? A psychologist might say everybody is at least a little neurotic. I agree. We all have some little idiosyncrasy that makes us just a little weird in someone else's eyes.

I'm still babbling. So its time to go. Later.

Josh showed up at the Library. *squeal* Maybe I'll go bug him and see if I can get into trouble.

I got the idea from The Davinci Code. How the Christian Church turned Sex and Our bodies and urges into evil things. yes, well. I don't quite know why I wrote this.... It just kind of came out. Its not even a poem.. its just.... something....
(don't censure me!)... (And don't laugh either. I'm, kinda embarrassed I wrote this)



Fading under the bright light of day, our devious minds come out to play. Flashing eyes dilate in anticipation, the pious watch in condemnation. The Goddess rises from her daily death and smiles and on us lets out her cleansing breath. She watches us with thankful eyes, her gentle gaze a pleasant guise. Darkness shines her beauty bright; we celebrate her love 'till the light.

"event","Wow. (that was intended fully for you Josh.)

And another wow that is directed towards the idiots at this school. I've been saying all week how I haven't been doing any work in my Accounting class and have no idea whats going on right? We took the Study Guide on Friday and I thought I might have barely passed. I ended up with the highest grade in the class. What does that tell you? I was surprised as hell when I got the SG back and realized this. (The grade was an 81. SHOCK)

I dreamed way too much last night and I remember fragments of it. The first one was all about me and Josh at his house... in his room.... but it was almost normal. Except the part at the end when Josh winked at me and pulled out a thong strap from his pants. LOL. I woke up at that point. 2:30 in the morn. I hate waking up before its time to get up. 

Then I had some weird dream about boating (in these little tiny Indian-ish boats). I remember everybody was lost and I was lugging around all their boats behind my boat and trying to find them and then Vin Desiel showed and up and tried to kill me. Then my alarm clock went off. It was a VERY odd dream.

Okay, more complaining. I hurt all over. I swear to god every muscle in my body is screaming at me. I can't even crack my back because when I try to my back muscles spasm and clench into a tight little fist of pain. GR. I think the sleeping and staying still all night really stiffened me up. And I have a bruise of unknown origins on my right thigh. (Hey Josh, wanna see?)

Alright, I'm done being a fabulous irritating complainor.

"event","Alicia is simply irresistably annoying. lol. I love her anyway. Oh, Josh, I forgot to mention that I have two wives. And Alicia is jealous of Melissa. lol. The point of this was that Alicia is now staying at my house instead of me going down there. Which is okay I suppose, though I was really looking forward to spending a night with Josh. *wink, wink* thats okay, we can all spend the night at Matt's house sometime instead. If he's okay with that. And Melissa too of course.

I get to finally see Melissa again! YAY! I've missed her. I haven't seen her in like two weeks. we'll probably end up going to Matt's house and to Walmart where I can attempt to embarrass Josh by purchasing underwear. *grin* doesn't that just sound like fun? Yes, I'm a bad person. Very naughty. lol.

Whelp, I think I might have passed the Study Guide for that class I've been paying absolutely no attention in. barely. I've simply got to do my homework for this week. no buts, no excuses. Just as soon as I check my emails and do lots of other things to stall..."

Josh got his surprise. I think he liked it. I haven't talked to Melissa in forever. I think maybe we should give her a call and see what she's up to today. I'm beginning to really miss her. 

I'm still not caught up on my work. I just simply cannot concentrate in that class. Could be that fact that I stayed up until 2:30 this morning watching the Adult Swim. AS rocks baby! yeah! (What could be better then comical situations and terrible animation?)

Oh, oh! in the class I couldn't concentrate in, I wrote a poem. It doesn't really make sense... but its all good, right?


Azure skies turn to gold
Streaked by the coming darkness
Nighttime begins to unfold
Stars shine and entrance

Dark creatures awake
Prowling the night restlessly
Water ripples in still lakes
Dry memories flee

Oh! Beauteous nightly lore
What are these flightless wings for?


I was really bored, can you tell? I even made syllables correspond. *groan* don't say a word. I'm trying to come up with a name for it right now. Got any ideas?

I think thats it for today.

I love you Josh

"event","well, maybe not sooo boring. school sux, but who cares anymore? being with Josh makes up for it. I posted something yesterday.... but for some reason it didn't post. stupid thing. anyway, Josh has a surprise waiting for him. He was going to get it yesterday, but I got caught up in Buffy and figured he'd call first. Not anybody's fault, cuz he didn't know I had time on my phone. so its all good.

Last night was terrific. the only thing lacking was bright beautiful stars to shine as brightly as I was feeling. Okay, so that was a little corny. I can't help it. Since We had to walk (Josh lost his license) we took the back way home and... well, it was pretty damn romantic. (your word sexy, but it fits. So romantic it is.) Anyway, I enjoyed it immensely. 

I've been slacking a bit on my work this week. (its only Tuesday... I'll catch up.) So I've got to go and do my Accounting work like a good little school girl.

Oh yeah, and we won't be going to Lish's this weekend, I just found out. Next weekend... if all goes well. I can't wait! and this Friday aught to be fun.... *wink, wink* not telling anymore.

I love you, Josh.

okay, maybe I shouldn't do that. Its funny, because I used to HATE going home, and now I want to be home so bad its like a sickness. I'm going slowly nuts, I swear. But its okay, because I'm going to call SOS today... (SOS=Some One Special=Josh). lol>> So I guess I'll make it.

this has been the longest.... um.... *counts mentally* Six days ever! (not quite a week yet). tomorrow, tomorrow, I LOVE tomorrow. lol.

On a side note, I got a call from the guy I was training his two year old horse for. I feel like a dope because I haven't yet told him I won't be able to train his horse again until the weather improves and he gets his fence back up. I told him once before but it seems I have to be a bit... firmer.

Well, I'm going to check and see if anybody else updated their journals now.

The hypocrite loves you forever. (directed toward SOS)

I read my BF's journal. he got all embarrassed because there was stuff about me in there. I just thought it was real sweet. but ya know....

anyway, I'm already making plans to go elsewhere when I get back from christmas vacation! right now I'm at my seconds family's house, waiting for SOMEONE to get out of the shower. lol. right, plans to go elsewhere: I'm going to try and take Josh and go to my friend Alicia's house soon. like, the second full weekend in Jan. can't wait, that aught to be fun. She says her parents won't care if a guy stays overnight there. we'll just have to see, huh?

Lish is my nutty friend. Oh yeah, nuttier then melissa when she and I get together, which is pretty damn bad. But she's hilarious and lots of fun. I can't wait to see her! She says shes going to tease Josh... but I think she won't if I tell her not to. wouldn't want to drive my Josh away....

So! thats about it for today. Maybe more later if I end up bored again.

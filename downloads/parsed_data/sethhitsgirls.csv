"event","i just woke up and am bored so here's an update on my life for all of those people out there who don't care

- i have a job now, i start the 18th at panera bread..... nothing great but it's money and i can look for a better job while i'm working there
- I'm going to a couple of doctors over the next couple of months for testing on a bunch of stuff, there's a good possibility i might have lyme disease... which   would kind of be awesome because it would explain a lot about me being sick all the time and a lot of other problems i have
- i have to go to the pediatrist on a regular basis now b/c i have been walking funny on my one foot since i messed up my ankle a couple years back and   now that foot is starting to hurt a lot... i'm supposed to get some specially molded insoles or something but my insurance won't cover them and they're $300    without insurance so i'm on some pain killers right now and if those aren't working too well then i'm going to get cortazone (sp?) shots every two weeks in    my foot
- in april there is going to be the greatest road trip ever with some of the greatest people ever
- mean streets is sticking in there.... a couple of shows coming up within the next couple of weeks
- I'm going to try and start volunteering at the humane society of charlotte and my family might also get an awesome little boxer/pit bull mix from there named   charlotte, she's white with a couple little brown spots and blue eyes and is deaf
- Going to shows with no money and leaving with money is awesome and has happened twice this weekend
- I'm really thankful for my friends and this weekend has been the greatest, there's nothing better than just going out of town and hanging out and acting half   your age it helps make me forget that i'm almost 22 and almost done with college
- shelter is awesome 
- that's pretty much it"

i've been thinking a lot lately about where i'm going in life....... and then i thought about it really hard and figured out that i don't really care.... and i don't really see any point in caring.... i mean why spend all my time worrying about what's going to happen and miss all that is happening... the last couple of months have had some amazing times..... i'm really thankful for the new friends i've made and the old ones that've stuck around... lots planned for this winter..... hopefully it will beat out the endless summer and be better..... 


but yeah on a final note come out tomorrow night....... we'll try to make it worth your $5"

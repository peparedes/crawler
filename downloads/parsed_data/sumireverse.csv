<b>Character name:</b> Sumire Takahana
<b>Fandom:</b> Venus Versus Virus
<b>Timeline:</b> SAVING THE WORLD SAVING THE WORLD-- Near the end of volume eight and from the Island! Also, she'll be coming from the S.S. Sif after lengthy and flawed transactions of paper work regarding her transfer.
<b>Age:</b> About... Sixteen 
<b>~*Magical*~ abilities and strengths:</b> 
Sumire has magical elemental abilities meaning she can control wind, earth, fire, and water in several versatile ways. For instance, she'll use wind to help her fly or combine earth and water to use MUD SLAP <s>not really, but something along those lines</s>. To an extent she is also a Berserker meaning, her strength and speed increase to the point where she can actually punch an enemy through the ribs. Before these powers could only be brought forth by using Vaccine (an 'antidote' made of dead Viruses to combat them) and she used a bracelet to inject doses of it into her. By volume eight though, she doesn't need to use Vaccine to use her powers anymore.

Another ability of hers is her strong sixth sense and the abilty to see Viruses called 'Vision.' Normally, she can sense when there is something supernatural about and she can see things like ghosts/spirits. Of course this isn't to say nothing can escape her sixth sense, but it is very potent.

She can also use firearms decidedly well or at least normal pistols.

<b>How would they use their abilities?:</b> Sumire would use her abilities to help fight the supernatural! Well, the supernatural who would try to hurt other people or people she likes. She also has normal domestic skills like cooking and cleaning and she's good at working at normal jobs.

<b>Appearance:</b> Sumire is of average height, probably about 5'4 or so. She has short bobbed red hair and blue-green eyes. She's slender and her fashion sense leans towards girly, but fashionable clothing... Which she's somehow still able to fight in pfffffff.

<b>Background/Personality:</b> 

Sumrie Takahana was a normal, slightly nervous wreck of a Japanese schoolgirl who was born with a keen sixth sense which meant she could sense things normal people usually couldn't. One night while rushing to her school dorm after having detention, Sumire finds a mysterious brooch on the ground that catches her eye. And of course being human, Sumire picks it up. Wondering where it came from she accidentally pricks her finger in the process of examining it... And begins to get a very, very, strange headache. Suddenly, she begins to see these strange monstrous creatures that she hasn't been able to notice before. She's able to avoid it, at least until the next day where it tries to assault her in broad daylight. As it begins to attack helpless her, a gunshot rings out and Sumire's savior turns out to be a girl wearing a gothic lolita dress, an eye-patch on her left eye, and armed with a fancy pistol.

And that's how this whole mess starts: Sumire learns the name of the girl who saved her, Lucia Nahashi, and also learns of her occupation; while she runs the clothing boutique, Venus Vangard on the surface, the business also helps clients who have problems with the same monsters Sumire encountered. Lucia explains that the creature she decimated was called a 'Virus.' Viruses are ghostly demons that hunt down humans with 'Vision' or the ability to see Viruses. These monsters eat those humans and those humans in turn, transform into Viruses themselves and they keep spreading and spreading very much like their namesake. Lucia's agency, the Venus Vanguard specifically deals with those Viruses using special bullets made from the creatures called Vaccine or simply, anti-Virus bullets. Along with Lucia's adoptive father, Sochiro Nahashi, and later on in the series, a telepathic girl named Lola, Sumire ends up living and working with Lucia to help get rid of the Viruses. 

Sumire also discovers that she has special powers that Lucia determined was useful against their enemies. These powers were discovered on accident when Lucia accidentally shot Sumire with a Vaccine bullet (bullets made out of dead Viruses to counter the monsters) while trying to be rid of a Virus at her school. This caused an unexpected reaction. Sumire's strength and speed suddenly increased and even her whole demeanor changed- for a few moments she wasn't a quiet and scared girl and instead was something deadly if not deadlier than any Virus- she basically went into Berserker mode. 

For a few months, Sumire continued her job at the Venus Vangard, improving as a hunter. She, Lucia, and Nahashi were still pretty much in the dark about her powers, but an accident that causes her to go Berserk and attack Lucia, proves that there is much more to her abilities and that she needs to control them lest she goes on a rampage and hurts others needlessly. This depresses the poor girl for a bit until she has a chance encounter with a boy named Yoshiki... And basically, it's love at first sight. 

Of course not everything can go well and Sumire soon finds herself facing new enemies: Ruka, Guy, Layla, lead by a woman named Sonoka (all of them have similar elemental powers) who is actually taking orders from a man named Lord Aion. They are also targeting their clients who have Vision. After attacking Yoshiki and even possessing one of her school friends, Sumire is determined to control her powers and use them to protect them. She is successful at this to a certain degree even though there's still the question as to why she keeps targeting Lucia when she loses to her Berserker instinct.

One night, they take on another job given to them by a student, but what starts out as a simple job, becomes a nightmarish night of falling stars as Sumire, Lucia, and Nahashi spread out across town to stop Sonoka's minions from killing their clients and taking their 'Fragments.' Luckily, Sumire spots Yoshiki being attacked by a Virus which she quickly kills, only to discover it was a former classmate of hers turned Virus; this shakes her up quite badly until Yoshiki calms her down. Sumire leaves him and ends up using too much Vaccine when going up against Ruka and goes Berserk; while this helps her thrash her opponents, she also goes after Lucia. Berserker Sumire keeps telling her to 'become one' <s>innuendo what's that</s> and rips off her eye patch. Lucia's left eye releases an enormous amount of power which ends the hunt. 

After that night, Nahashi, who has gained more information about their enemies, tells the girls that they have six months until the next meteor shower, which is when their enemies will begin hunting for people with Vision again. Sumire and Lucia are left to make amends and recover from that terrible night. Although Lucia lashes out at Sumire for attacking her and claims that even she herself is a monster due to her left eye, Sumire reaffirms her devotion to their friendship and declares she'd never desert Lucia. 

Enter Lola, the adoptive granddaughter of Nahashi's mentor, Professor Dermeil! She's here to make weapons for the Venus Vangard, eat chocolate, and kick ass (and to get back her twin sister Layla from the Dark Side). Oh, and she also has information from Dermeil. about their enemies, Fragments, and Lucia and Sumire's role regarding all of these shenanigans. But first, Sumire tries to have a semblance of a normal life by going on a date with Yoshiki! That is quickly ruined by Ruka who has powered up by consuming a Fragment. She almost overpowers Sumire, but then there is a twist-- Yoshiki protects Sumire using his own magic this time and even takes on Guy. Sumire of course is now suspicious and wonders why Yoshiki has been hiding this from her this whole time and it also brings up the question if he's also hiding anything else...

But then he kisses her, she passes out, and is picked up by Lucia and Lola. When she wakes up, she discovers that Yoshiki is gone and when she tries to track him down, she's left with no clues and only more suspicions despite wanting to trust Yoshiki no matter what. Lucia comforts her and they continue their Virus hunting as usual and she even gets to learn more about Lucia's past, making the two girls become even closer. Sumire tries to ignore her nightmares of murdering Lucia however... FORESHADOWING?

Later, the Venus Vangard group have a meeting with Layla and Lola tries to convince her twin to come back to her. Instead, they are left with a letter from Aion, the big bad and puppeteer of all the events up until now. Layla leaves and they read the contents of the letter:

<i>On the night when fragments fall from the dawn star,
The slumbering gate shall be awaken by the key...
Guiding me to the world that shall be mine.</i> 

Dermeil's spirit possesses Lola to explain to Sumire, Lucia, and Nahashi the nature of the Fragments and 'True World' Aion and his followers are trying to achieve. Aion believes that the current world they live in is 'incomplete' and therefore 'evil.' He wants to destroy the current world and use the Fragments (which are believed to be the building blocks that hold the power of creation-- when taken the person in question turns into a Virus) collected from souls from people with Vision to rebuild and make a perfect world where the idea of good and evil is transcended. Fragments, however, are not the only thing Aion wants. What he wants are the 'Gate' and the 'Key' which is Lucia and Sumire respectively-- he wants to use the two girls to lead the way to the 'True World' and it can be realized through them because of their enormous power and the fact that they both carry marks of the original Fragments. Sumire is especially significant because she just so happens to be something of a reincarnation of Lucia's mother who used to be the original 'Key' until her untimely death, but fate just so happened to choose Sumire to be that role instead (no really). 

Armed with this new information, they also realize that the next meteor shower is on September 16th, Sumire's birthday. They prepare themselves by training and refining their powers. Sumire continues to go to school and even her friends begin to notice her serious and mature attitude; much different than from the quiet unassertive Sumire they knew before. While she tries to enjoy the time spent with friends and family, Sumire still has Yoshiki on her mind and she feels guilty for not being able to protect him, but also has conflicting feelings about what he may be hiding from her.

To try and lighten things up, Sumire, Nahashi, and Lola decide to throw Lucia a birthday party! But if you can't tell already, the pattern is that nice things happen and then there is no nice things. After the initial celebration, Sumire finds a book underneath Lucia's bed and wishing Lucia a happy birthday... from Yoshiki. Misunderstanding ensues, but Lucia explains to her that Yoshiki is actually Aion. Sumire thinks this is all a joke and tries to think of reasons why this can't be true. Her feelings and uncertainty towards Yoshiki and what Lucia has just explained to her cause her to leave the Vangard. She spends time with her friends and family and then leaves a letter for Lucia thanking her for all the good times despite all the fighting and that she wants to be the one to protect everyone this time.

Sumire finally decides to move on and face Aion-Yoshiki herself and get the truth no matter how hurtful it was to her. Unfortunately, her confrontation ends up making her give into Aion who convinces her through more trickery to turn to his cause which is to destroy the evil and hurtful world they live in for the chance of a better one.

Lucia, Nahashi, and Lola show up at the villain's hideout for a final showdown on September 16th and to get Sumire back. Sumire has other ideas however, she starts attacking Lucia using four elemental spells of earth, wind, fire, and <s>heart</s> water. This triggers the power in Lucia's left eye to open a pathway to make a new world and Aion starts the World Creation using the Fragments collected from past victims. As everyone floats in this in-between boundary of the real world and the world to be, Lucia finds Sumire who says she decided to go along with Aion's plan because she wanted to help make a world where everyone she loved could never get hurt again. Lucia convinces her otherwise saying that despite all of her hardships, it was Sumire who helped her become a better person. And despite the world being crappy? It's not worth starting over especially when they already have so many memories that shouldn't be erased. 

And thus, Lucia and Sumire undo the World Creation, defeat Aion, and save Yoshiki, Lola, and Layla. Nahashi saves them from the closing rift and disappears for a short while leaving Sumire and Lucia to wonder about his fate (spoilers, he's fine, but they don't know that yet because this is where we leave off!)

<b>Personality</b>:

Sumire used to be as meek as a mouse. Before she got nervous and scared easily due to being able to sense the supernatural. Her mild mannered personality gave her somewhat low confidence and even her friends and family didn't expect her to be very assertive. As the series goes on, however, she begins to develop an inner strength and will to protect the people she loves and others who suffer from Virus attacks. The choices she makes are absolute and she isn't the type to go back on her decisions. This can also prove to be a liability though; because she wants to protect her friends so much and combined with that leftover uncertainty, she's not sure if she's absolutely capable which becomes a hindrance to thinking clearly and logically. She's a pretty emotional person overall.

She's very warmhearted and kind towards her friends and those she holds precious to her. Lucia herself described her as 'motherly' which ironically isn't too far off. She worries about other people sometimes more than herself and will do her best to know how others are doing. What's most important to Sumire is seeing the people she cares about being happy and for them not to get hurt and it shows in how fiercely protective she is when her enemies threaten her friends and Yoshiki. Her kindness does extend to strangers though, especially to the clients that the Venus Vangard receives. She can empathize with their customer's fear of Viruses seeing as how she used to be completely helpless herself and when they suffer she feels extremely guilty for not being able to help more. She can be overly trusting and this part of her personality has been taken advantage of several times in the past.

Sumire is someone who can be teased rather easily and someone as mentioned before, wears her heart on her sleeve; her expressions aren't too hard to read, she flushes when embarrassed, and overall is a mostly sensitive soul. Still, she does get more confident as time goes on and becomes more fearless in the face of danger. She also develops a playful nature as she grows older, being teasing towards her friends especially towards Lucia. 

For all the dark fantasy gung-ho fighting she gets into, Sumire still retains her normal teenage girl interests. She likes to dress up in cute fashions, hang out with friends, and get teenage girl crushes (like the one on Yoshiki, but we can see where that led to). 

So from quiet, timid schoolgirl with a sixth sense, to determined demon exterminator with magical elemental powers. Sumire's been through a lot of experiences and each one no matter how painful, only makes her stronger and more willful. Ultimately, she wants the people she loves in her world to be happy and she'll do anything to protect that happiness.

<s><b>Why should that character be in this game:</b> For OCs only.</s>

<b>Why do you want to continue their history here:</b> Sumire has had a lot of development over at <lj user=""i_s_l_a_n_d_rp""> and formed lots of relationships. There aren't many physical changes since she was canon updated constantly up until volume eight of the manga. Her development on the island sort of goes along with her development in the manga. She learns to grow stronger and be more confident and she meets people she cares about and wants to protect both back in her world, but more significantly from the island. On the Thor, she'll recognize people, but she won't expect them to recognize her (she might make a mistake or two) since she's more than aware of the different worlds and timelines. The one person she WILL recognize as a fellow islander is <lj user=""crazy_about_it"" title=""Dante Sparda""> with whom she shares a sibling like relationship with. 

She will be arriving from the <i>S.S. Sif</i> after completing tons of paperwork to be approved for transfer to the <i>Thor.</i>

<s><b>For applicants considering an alternate version of a character already in game, please use this as your chance to explain the key differences between your character and the one already in play:</b></s> 

<b>Have you read up on how the game works?:</b> Network is called Flaming Ferrit and you earn money by signing up for missions, thieving, mooching, or playing with black jack and hookers. Except for that last part.

<b>1st person sample:</b> 

[<small>Here's a feed of Sumire at a shooting range wielding a pistol looking a bit nervous, but doing her best to look confident.</small>]

Um... Hello! My mission this month is to help instruct others in firearm safety and give tips on how to aim and shoot properly! Thankfully, I've worked with pistols before so none of you have anything to worry about! I-It's true! I may not look it, but I've had lots of experience! 

Oh, sir aren't those ear plugs too small for you? And you're missing a few... You've got more than one pair of ears. Eheh, no offense! Go to the front desk and ask for another pair. It's going to get pretty loud in here so I don't want anyone to be uncomfortable.

[<small>Some of the aliens look a bit doubtful so Sumire turns to one of the targets pointing her pistol at it</small>]

By the end of the day all of you can hopefully... [<small>BANG. BANG BANG. Three shots. Two are on the outer ring of the bulls-eye and the last bullet hits dead center.  She smiles at the aliens a bit embarrassed at their sounds of awe as she rubs the back of her head.</small>]

... Shoot like this! Any other questions?

<b>3rd person sample:</b>

Time, space, and alternate worlds had a funny way of messing one's head. Sumire Takahana knew this all too well especially after staying on the island for so long. People came, people left, some remembered, some didn't. It was the same on the <i>S.S. Thor</i> with the key difference being that this was space and not a talking island that got very moody every now and then.

The Virus hunter sighed, lost in thought, as she settled down on a park bench watching alien children and some other refugees drift about. It wasn't as if she was against making new friends. Hell, she actually liked meeting new people from different places and if it wasn't for making new friends and getting connections, she was pretty sure she wouldn't be able to cope emotionally with this whole 'world being destroyed' business.

""Still,"" she murmured to herself, ""it doesn't stop the hurt from coming back...""

Any friend she made could disappear in a blink of an eye due to the wormholes, just like how Lucia, Nahashi, Lola, and Yoshiki disappeared from her when she was rescued by the refugee ship. And if they came back, there wasn't a high guarantee that they would remember her as a friend. The thought was extremely depressing to say the least.

And yet...

Sumire idly took out her Guide and scrolled through the room listings. Her face immediately lit up with a smile when she spotted a familiar name or two. She stood up and briskly walked out of the park feeling more resolute.

Whether they remembered her or not, was of no consequence. She knew she could stay strong with all the good memories of her old friends and with that strength she would set out to make new ones in this infinite vast space.

<b>Questions?:</b> Have you had your shots lately?
<b>Did you put your characters name and fandom in the subject:</b> YES.

A shudder through her head, her body, and most of all the pain in the back of her eyes.&nbsp; She was falling, but she couldn't really tell if she was falling up or falling down. It was here. That monster, that killer, that thing... <i>Her. </i>She was back, and all Sumire could do was lay down and watch in a daze. Was her body hurting? She wasn't quite sure anymore. All she knew was this:<br /><br />It wasn't going to hurt anymore. That's all that mattered. She didn't want to get hurt. She didn't want to FEEL hurt. It's not going to hurt anymore, she told herself.<br /><br />&quot;She&quot; could not discern the figures in front of her... There were two? Wasn't there only one? Wasn't there only... <i>Him??<br /><br />Him... Him... <b>HIM.</b><br /><br /></i>A burning unfamiliar hatred was lit aflame. He was hurting her. How DARE he hurt her? &quot;She&quot; decided quite easily that she was not going to tear him apart quickly. No, no, this person was going to be torn apart, slowly, deliberately, <i>painfully</i>. If he wanted to get torn apart so badly why not? <br /><br />Sumire still in her trance watched as &quot;she&quot; stood up and rushed at the two figures. &quot;She&quot; could feel ecstasy rush through her veins, her whole entire being. The other&nbsp; didn't matter.&nbsp; He held her down, but that was remedied. &quot;She&quot; fell, but got up back again. The monster wasn't going to let them hurt her anymore. If they wanted &quot;her&quot; to see their tears so badly, the killer would gladly consent; they would cry so hard, tears of blood would spill. Three people now. Sumire felt her eyes go wide.<br /><br /><i>This is wrong. This is just so WRONG.</i> <br /><br />&quot;Her&quot; hand lifted as she laughed gleefully.<br /><br /><i>Stop it...<br /><br /></i>The monster would not stop. It stood there laughing.<br /><br /><i>STOP IT!!!<br /></i><br />There was a voice... A kind voice asking if she was okay. Another voice, stern, but with an unusual warmth that Sumire could recognize. &quot;She&quot; was beginning to fade... <br /><br /><i>Go away... It hurts, but... Go away...<br /><br /></i>And everything went black.<br /><br /><div align=""center"">---<br /><br /><div align=""left"">Hibari, Yamamoto, and Gojyo stared silently at the slender figure of Sumire&nbsp; relaxed. Blood ran down her hands where Berserker had grabbed the hidden spikes of Hibari's tonfas; ruby red drops dripped from the tips of her fingertips. The scarlet eyes had changed back into the gentle, but pained teal-green color that they usually were. But it wasn't the state of her outside condition that Sumire was ashamed of.<br /><br />They had seen her monster. And she couldn't protect them like she told herself she would before she was taken away.<br /><br />She could see Yamamoto's look of utter confusion, Hibari's expression of utter indifference, and what hurt her most... Gojyo's grim face stabbed her for some reason she could not describe.<br /><br />&quot;Y-Y-a... Ma-..moto... Gojyo...&quot; she uttered tottering slowly towards them. <br /><br />The pain that she could not feel at first suddenly enveloped her and she fell.<br /><br /><i>I'm sorry.</i></div></div><br /><br /><i><br /><br /></i><br />&nbsp;</div><br />Not my best, but eh? 8D;;"

we went to waikiki on oahu and it was so busy! but fun...and AMAZING shopping.....burberry, (4 coach stores), fendi, macys... but i didn't do a lot of shoppin! and we went to waimea bay which was my fave and the water was sooo clear, like i stood on this cliff thing and looked down and u could see the white sand on the bottom! and there was like no seaweed or ne thing....so i jumped off it!! and it was the most fun ever. and we went to the north shore and the drive was sooooo beautiful! 

then we went to maui and to a luau and i tried OCTAPUS! ahh! it was yucky. and we just stayed at the hotel all week. and the waves on this beach were UNBELEIVABLE....like u couldn't walk into the ocean w/o gettin knocked over, they were so powerful and big and so much fun! and we went on atv's all over this mouatain thing and that was funnnnn.

OMG we went snorkeling at this one place, and 45 MINUTES before we got there someone DIED there!! and i just can't snorkel cuz its scary  cuz ur like a foot over these big coral things w/ fish swimmin around and i just couldn't do it! annnd wen we were in oahu, there all these tiger shark warnings in maui...like a bunch swam up to shore. annnd like 2 people got lost at sea after being on jet skis for a few days (but then found). so it was a lil scary!

but it was soo cool cuz we were on one of the beaches, and if u looked out, could see a bunch of dolphins swimmin and like jumpin outta the water!! it was crazy!!!

annnnnnd kenny and renee! i just dont know how i feel about this. but right now: not happy.

annnnd jodie left today! and i miss her already. and now i dont have her clothes or her car, or ne sex and the city DVDs.......

(owww my teeth r like hurting so bad, i feel like i just have so many cavities!!)

but i made like 10/hour and so now i can go to the village and just buy lots of clothes for HAWAII!

and me and alicia skipped third hour last week and went to bruegers, and that was probably my highlight of that week!!!!!

and pretty much im like totally booked for my summer now! i have cheer 3 days a week, plus C!M stunt camp, RARA camp, Car Washes, All Star Game, C!M camp, C!M support staff, and a leadership conference! AHHH!

lately i've just felt sooo pressured to pretty much plan the rest of my life! like, decide wat career i want, so i can choose the best college, decide exactly where i wanna work and its just impossible for me cuz i just love EVERYTHING. so i kno i'll be happy w/e i do, but ahhh, i just dont wanna give up ne of my hobbies. heres wat im thinkin:

I L O V E arts and crafts, its dorky i kno, but i just want like my own hallmark type store and i can just make homeade cards and picture frames and just stuff like that.

I also L O V E highschool. and just maybe i wanna be a highschool teacher, which would be perfect wen i have kids so i can like have the summer off w/ them. 

i also L O V E  G O D! haha, so i def. hafta incoroporate that. like more missions or leading a small group, somethin of that sort or majoring in it in college! (and i also gotta decide if i wanna take a year off somewhere in there to do an internship at kensington or somethin of that sort.....)

annnnd tonight i decided i wanna be a doctor! CRAZY! it might just be a phase, but i just love learning about diseases...but mostly just like brain disease....(not psycological) but like alzhiemrs (sp?) and autism...just things of that sort. but i just dont kno wat kinda doctor that would be...to like diagnos people w/ the problem and specialize in those kinda diseases! and i also hate the stupid science (a.k.a chemistry/phsyics). 

and i LOVE TO CHEER, so i wanna be a cheer coach, but thats a ton of work and really time consuming!!

so will someone just decide for me! i feel like i need to decide tonight, i hate not having a plan or w/e and i just love too much stuff and i gotta look at colleges this summer...AAAHHHHHH!!!"

I'm So excited!

My sister came home this weekend and i'm so happy bout that, not just cuz i get to use her car and wear her clothes, but i love hangin out w/ my sisters.

But i decided i should probably get a job, cuz i really need money right now! b/c i really need to get some summery clothes for hawaii...ahh, shopping, it brings up a sensitive subject for me (i just bought some super cute shoes last week, and they're on sale this week!!!)

I am just so ready for this year to be over, even though i've loved this year a ton and don't want senior year to come (cuz it'll go by too fast), but i just can't take all the work! it's soo frustrating, and i just don't want to do it...at all.

So i was goin thru some pretty hard times and prayed to God that he would help me thru wat i was going thru, and the next day i cam across this...

    ""When i want to do good, evil is right there with me. For in my inner being I delight in God's Law; but i see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members. What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God - Through Jesus Christ our Lord!"" Romans 7.

...it's pretty sweet wat a little prayer can do."

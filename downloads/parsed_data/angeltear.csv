Started at P.J. ______(something) in Teal sq. After many attempts to call people to come out and realizing I need to update my phone book, we gave up and headed over to the Joshua Tree in Davis sq. Watched some kick boxing and head out before the game got started. From here we decided it was too early to call it a night and went looking for a bar with out door seating (didn't find any) so we went to Hong Kong in Harvard sq. then to Chariles. 

And last night I found out my Uncle Bobby is in town!!!! So in a bit when the rooms not so spinning I'm going to head to the south shore to visit then back up here tonight.  YAY!"

and probably have many friends. You are sweet and<br>kind and that shows on you,
but you're also strong and not very naive. You're a<br>rather well-rounded
individual. Even though some people pass you off as<br>just another girl, shrug it

Uhm, cool... thanks. 

So I go home home tonight and leave there at 8 am and be cool and stuff.... 

In other news, I still don't care for the area I'm in, but my landlords had me over for dinner last night and it was nice. I'm really happy for them to be moving to a better situation. Their son rocks! I love living in a house with a small child who is just so cool. And who I can send back to mommy when I'm done playing. :-)

Bought a bunch of new clothes for tomorrow, I even bought a dress!! Not that I'll wear it to the interview, but it was cute and Sally said I should buy it ;-) Had a lot of fun monday. Must do anime night again and again and again!!!!! Crystal rocks with her mad popcorn skills! And Erin was very nice to drop us off. Thank you sweety!

They have a history of stealing and lying to my Nana (whom I love dearly) The latest get-rich-of-my-mother(nana) plan was to have her sign a reverse morgage on my uncle Pauls house. That would entitle her to receive monthly checks from the government. Sounds good right? The catch is that my uncle Paul had no intention to give ANY of the money to my Nana (his MOTHER) and was never going to give over his house. Leaving my Nana in a situation where she could end up in jail!!!!
AND my Aunt Rene (shudder) is stealing my Nana's phone line cause hers got shut off for not paying the bill! Nana sold her BOYFRIEND (not her husband but a person who has no ties to the family) her house at almost a third of what it was worth. They set her up in trailer attached to the house and send their autistic son over there when ever they don't feel like watching him. AND she use to steal checks from Nana and cash them herself, that is until my sister Cay stepped in and took over my Nana's finances. I feel sick just thinking about all the crap they have put this women through. I was going to offer an olive branch and invite them to my graduation. BUT FUCK THAT! I want nothing to do with them unless it has to do with getting justice for my Nana!

You scum of the earth thing!

My mom had the great of idea of suing them for all the money they had ever stolen from her. I say DO IT!! Hell I'll do it! What makes a person hurt the women who brought them into this world? I swear that if my Dad or Papa were still alive they would line them up and bitch-smack the hell out of them."

"event","So I came to school at 6 after being at work at 9:30 to meet up with a friend who said he would help me print. It now being 7:30 and me sitting here not able to do anything isn't what I had in mind. Stress levels are at an all time high and moods are swinging like a drunk Irish man in a bar fight. Blah I'll be glad when all of this is done."

"event","Thursdays are my early day, so I got to school kind of groggy and start roaming around with my fruit cup and water (fav new breakfast) and low and behold MY artwork is hanging up around the school!!!!! YAY! Now I know what you are thinking, ""you just had a show, big woop!"" It is a big deal, this means that some one who doesn't know me, thinks my work is good. Hehehe, well it made me feel good. I should mention there is a lot of work up by a lot of people right now for open house. But hey I wanted to feel happy and it seems like a good reason. :-)

In more related school news, I stayed home yesterday. I was behind on my portfolio (seems to be the theme) so I figured with nothing new to show and nothing printed it would be best to stay home and work on ...stuff... I got a lot done and will print tonight!!!! No really I will. maybe. My mom is planing on throwing my a party when I'm done in May or June. It will be a finish with school/ moving out party. I think it will be a good reason to get money. ;-)
